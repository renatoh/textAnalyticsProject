But South Australia\u2019s \u201ckick a Vic\u201d mentality comes out in all sorts of ways, even subtle ones like football team names. In most states, Australian rules sides will happily borrow their identity \u2013 from mascot to colours to club song \u2013 from their big brothers in Melbourne. They are a bit more discerning in SA, and nowhere is that as strong as in Adelaide\u2019s Southern Football League. Fans of Noarlunga cheer on the Mighty Shoes. Up in Reynella, they bleed for the Wineflies. Over in Morphett Vale, they have the Emus \u2013 a surprisingly rare choice of mascot in this country, given its position on the coat of arms. The league was once home to the Crushers, the Mudlarks and, for a short time, the Macclesfield Blood and Tars. The best name of all though comes from Port Noarlunga. Head through the dunes by the Onkaparinga River mouth on a Saturday afternoon and you might just hear the cries of \u201cC\u2019arn the Cockle Divers!\u201d The team\u2019s emblem features one of those old-fashioned diving helmets they used in the days before scuba was a thing. It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve come up with the goods though. Their last premiership was back in the late 90s. As original as the Cockle Divers might sound, it\u2019s not. Port Adelaide was using that mascot back in the 19th century, long before they became the Magpies and then the Power. Bonus points: the current coach of the Cockle Divers is a bloke going by the name of Mr Manhood. 2) Parkes Spacemen Unfortunately for this list, the tiny Central West town of Bogan Gate does not field a team in any competitions of note. Up the road in Parkes, though, they\u2019ve got a cosmically themed team that\u2019s worthy of inclusion. The town\u2019s rugby league team goes by the name of the Spacemen. The reason for their unusual nickname will be obvious to anyone who has seen The Dish. The classic Australian film showed the role this unassuming little town played in one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements \u2013 the moon landing. It\u2019s all thanks to the local observatory. The Spacemen are one of the power teams of the Group 11 competition at the moment, having made it to five of the past six grand finals. They won the title in 2013, but lost last year to a team from Dubbo once known as the Fish Eaters (or, look away now grammar police, the Fishie\u2019s \u2013 their apostrophe). The Spacemen\u2019s neanderthal forebears can be found south of the border. Where else, I hear you say. In the town of Buchan, there\u2019s an Aussie rules team known as the Cavemen. It\u2019s a nod to the local underground tourist attraction, the Buchan Caves. Their rivals include the Swampies and the Ranges. Not Rangers. The Ranges. 3) Pumarali Thunder &amp; Lightning Aussie rules is played differently in the Top End, and particularly so on the Tiwi Islands. Its annual grand final is a cultural event as much as a football one, and it\u2019s become a pilgrimage for Darwin residents (and even for some from down south too). There\u2019s a distinct local flavour even in the team names too. During the wet season, the Top End sky puts on a brilliant \u2013 and at times terrifying \u2013 sound and light show almost every night, as the heavens release their fury. It\u2019s a name captured perfectly by the Pumarali Thunder &amp; Lightning, a team from the Tiwis. Over in Arnhem Land, there\u2019s the Maningrida Lightning Strikes. They are far from the first teams to take on the such stormy names, but it\u2019s the extra details in their names that give them something over, say, the Halls Head Lightning or the Melbourne Storm. Another part of Top End life is captured in Muluwurri\u2019s mascot, the Magpie Geese. The bird is a local delicacy. When someone is said to have \u201cbeen on the magpie geese\u201d, it\u2019s a roundabout way of saying they\u2019ve spent too long at the dining table over the off-season. 4) Young Cherrypickers Food-related names were once a staple of the Aussie rules world. Retired names are rumoured to include the Apple Snatchers (out of northern Tasmania), the Toffee Apples (from Melbourne\u2019s south-eastern suburbs) and the grimace-inducing Rice Eaters (based in the Victorian goldfields). And in rugby league? There\u2019s still the Young Cherrypickers. It might be a far more amusing name if it wasn\u2019t for nearly every off-field scandal involving an NRL player ever. The town of Young sits on the south west slopes of New South Wales, and is known as \u201cthe undisputed cherry capital of Australia\u201d. Local agriculturalists may think their team\u2019s name does the place proud. The rest of us are just left scratching our heads. Seriously: what were they thinking when they came up with this name? Even as a sporting term, it\u2019s far from complimentary. Small golf clap, though, for Young\u2019s masters side, who call themselves the Cherryatrics. The town hosts the National Cherry Festival every December, where you can engage in a cherry pie eating championship and a pip spitting competition in the off-season. It is ball sports that set the town\u2019s heart racing, and Cherrypickers of note include former Canberra Raiders Brett Mullins and Simon Woolford, and Melbourne Storm\u2019s Jordan McLean. A (dis)honourable mention goes to the Casino Cougars in the Northern Rivers League \u2013 a league which also hosts Ghosts, Seahorses, Axemen and some mythical Dirawongs. 5) Charles Sturt University Bushpigs Usually, football teams save the insults for their opposition, and pick a mascot that might strike fear into the hearts of those they come up against. Exhibit A: the Vampiresof East Brighton. They are the most terrifying thing to come out of Melbourne\u2019s beachside suburbs since post-surgery Warnie. It\u2019s a different story in the Farrer League of the NSW Riverina, where the boys from Charles Sturt University have taken on the Bushpigs as their moniker. If you\u2019ve spent a minute in Australia, you won\u2019t need the Urban Dictionary to tell you that a bush pig is not a nice thing to be called. Especially if you are a woman, though at the CSU Football &amp; Netball Club, the women are known more affectionately as the Bushsows. True fact. And just in case you thought this was some undergraduate prank, well, it\u2019s not an isolated case of bush pig adoration. The rugby union club in Jindabyne is known as the same thing, and the old club of Brownlow medallist Adam Cooney was known as the Bushpigs during the 80s and 90s. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise they are in the Southern Football League. The hills outside Melbourne also shelter the Yarra Glen River Pigs, while Dunsborough in Western Australia is home to a rugby union side known as the Dungbeetles. 6) Mountt Burr Mozzies SA\u2019s Mid South East League boasts one of the most Aussie teams in the country: the Mount Burr Mozzies. They play in green and gold, for a start. Their club song isn\u2019t an adaption of some show tune, but a re-working of Along The Road To Gundagai. It features rhyming slang and \u2018Strine, not to mention the meteorologically challenged lines: \u201cWe will play \u2018em all together, in any kind of weather, under clear blue skies\u201d. But it\u2019s for choosing a really, really, really annoying pest as a mascot that Mt Burr, we salute you. There are precisely zero nice things you can say about the mosquito. But that little blood sucker has lead Mt Burr to a league-record 19 flags. That includes triple three-peats. Other invertebrate names of note: the Central Charlestown Butcher Boys from Newcastle; the Gladstone Mudcrabs, an Aussie rules team from the Queensland coast; and the Yabbies, which can be found all over the country. Inadvertently making the list all the way from Germany: Wormatia Worms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
