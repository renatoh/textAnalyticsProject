Harvard and Yale, for example, recently announced dramatic reductions in the cost for students from families who earn less than $180,000 (in the case of Harvard) and $200,000 (in the case of Yale). Harvard has also announced that it would increase next year's need-based financial aid budget by 21% - an increase that far outpaces the 3.5% annual rise in tuition fees. The lion's share of financial aid goes to truly needy families, but a considerable amount will go to those whom Harvard has called \"middle income families,\" but whom the rest of us would call the \"upper middle class\" and beyond. Harvard notes that $180,000 is the median family income among its students, yet only eight per cent of all households in the US whose head is between 25 and 64 years old earned more than $150,000 in 2006. Yet next year, a family that earns $180,000 will pay only $18,000 of an approximately $45,000 comprehensive fee - which is itself already considerably less than the full cost. There's nothing wrong with Harvard's decision to help upper middle class students pay for college. But there is one big problem: the federal government is subsidizing this decision. In fact, US taxpayers last year paid more for each Harvard student than did the wealthiest families who receive no financial aid. That can't make sense. As economists, we respect the right of individuals and institutions to spend their money as they please, but we do not believe that financial aid to the wealthy should be paid for in part by the implicit and explicit federal subsidies exceeding $1bn last year that both Harvard and Yale received. On June 30, 2006, for example, Harvard's endowment was $29.2bn. During the following 12 months Harvard's endowment earned about $6.7bn in interest, dividends and capital gains. Because Harvard qualifies as a tax-exempt organization, it pays no income taxes on any of these gains. Using the federal rate of 15% on dividends and capital gains, Harvard's endowment essentially received a federal subsidy of more than $1bn during the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2007. And it doesn't end there. Harvard also receives an implicit federal subsidy on its debt because it is allowed to issue bonds that are exempt from federal income taxes for the majority of its borrowing needs. During fiscal year 2007, for example, Harvard paid an effective interest rate of 4.4% on its tax-exempt bonds and 6% on its taxable debt. The 1.6 percentage point gap in effective interest rates is a rough estimate of the implicit subsidy Harvard receives from its ability to issue tax-exempt debt. This is also the approximate amount of additional federal income tax that bondholders would have to pay if all of Harvard's debt were taxable. Applied to Harvard's outstanding tax-exempt debt of $2.5bn, this results in an annual federal subsidy of about $40m. Harvard and its donors also receive an implicit subsidy when donors make tax-deductible gifts. During fiscal year 2007, for example, Harvard received $532m in gifts. Assuming that donors were in the 33% marginal federal tax bracket, these gifts resulted in reduced federal taxes of $175m. While this tax break directly benefits donors, it provides an even bigger benefit to Harvard because it provides an incentive for increased charitable giving. In fact, most economists who have looked at this issue estimate that charitable giving rises by more than the tax break provided to donors. Thus the $175m in lost Federal revenues provided more than $175m in benefit to Harvard. These three items alone reduced federal tax revenues by more than $1.2bn in fiscal year 2007 - or almost $60,000 for each of Harvard's 20,000 students. It is also important to remember that Harvard students are among the most talented students in the country - students whose earning potential is considerably above the typical American. So while we find it hard to object to Harvard using its own funds to subsidise families in the top 10 per cent of national income, we question whether all of the $1.2bn of federal subsidies that it received last year supported charitable purposes. We are, however, sympathetic to the concern that students who graduate with considerable debts are more likely to enter the highest-paying professions, like investment banking, partly to repay them more quickly. There is, however, a more equitable solution to this legitimate concern that does not involve increasing subsidies to the affluent: income-contingent loans. Charge all students reasonable fees for their education and provide loans for all those who desire it. (We happen to believe that all families, no matter their income, should be asked to make some contribution to their child's education.) In this case, however, the interest and principal on these loans would be tied to future incomes. Over the life of the loan, brilliant social workers would pay less and investment bankers would pay more - but on average the loans would be repaid. It's time we stopped subsidising wealthy students at the wealthiest institutions, and put our tax revenues to better use: how about increasing Federal student loans and making them fully contingent on income?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
