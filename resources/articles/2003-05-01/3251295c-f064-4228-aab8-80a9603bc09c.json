Indeed, had he stuck to his word when his country defeated France in the final, he would not have been greatly missed by many. But it came as no surprise when, after a leg operation in December, he changed his mind. And yesterday, having beaten Carlos Moya, the No3 seed, 6-4, 7-6 in the third round of the Italian Open, he positively skipped off the Foro Italico's red clay like a man reborn. \"It's a long time since I have felt that excited. I'm as happy as I was when I won the French Open,\" said Kafelnikov, although it might be stretching faith in this most unpredictable of men to suppose he could repeat his 1996 triumph at Roland Garros next month. \"I don't want to make any goals,\" he added. Yet it clearly thrilled him to reach the quarter-finals here for the first time in 10 attempts; it was as if all the premature talk of retirement last year had lifted an overwhelming weight off him. \"I'd accomplished everything I had set out to do - winning the French and Australian Opens, Olympic gold medal and Davis Cup. So I said: 'Why don't you try another year and see if you can enjoy your tennis like you did once?' And I've been doing it.\" The 29-year-old Russian's desire to enjoy his tennis again was coupled with an equal desire to keep the dollars flowing. Kafelnikov has always been the iron man of the professional circuit, winning more than 50 singles and doubles titles in all. Had he spread his quality a little more sparingly, he might have won more than two grand slam titles. But that is not his nature. Today he plays Martin Verkerk, the Dutchman who knocked out Andy Roddick and yesterday thrashed Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 6-0, 6-3. In the doubles Tim Henman and Gustavo Kuerten lost 7-5, 7-6 to the Australian Joshua Eagle and Jared Palmer of the United States in their second match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
