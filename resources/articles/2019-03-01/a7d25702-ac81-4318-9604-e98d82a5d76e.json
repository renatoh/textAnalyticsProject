Germany and Netherlands are both improving, but Germany\u2019s quicker, younger players won the day. Thanks for your company and comments - ta-ra. Netherlands 2-3 Germany Northern Ireland 2-1 Belarus Poland 2-0 Latvia Slovenia 1-1 Macedonia Cyprus 0-2 Belgium Poland are heading to the top of Group G with two wins from two. So Northern Ireland lead Group C with a 100% record. They meant Estonia and Belarus next, before four games against Germany and Netherlands. What a game and what a result for Germany. It takes serious stanes to lost a two-goal lead and still win. But why did it take World cup embarrassment for Low to realise that running fast and running lots are important qualities for a football team? That\u2019s a huge win! Well! Revenge! Lovely play from Gundogan just outside the box, who twirls to feed in a pass the sends Reus to the line. He crosses low, and Schulz, the left-wing-back, punches a composed finish into the far corner. What revenge this is for Germany, who lost 3-0 the last time these sides met. Germany have done really well to see Holland away since conceding the equaliser. This has been a pretty nifty game. Into injury-time in Belfast... and what save that is! Nekhajchik, picked out by a ball over the top, slides into a shot six yard out ... but Peacock-Farrell saves with his feet! Change for Germany, Reus replacing Gnabry - who was very good in the first half and scored a very, very good goal. This is a beautifully constructed goal. Northern Ireland move the ball from left to right, then down the line, and McNair\u2019s low cross is touched home by Magennis from five yards! Gnabry, who\u2019s been quiet this half, picks up a ball that beats De Ligt over his head. At inside-left, he charges Van Dijk, ducking inside, outside and inside again, before drilling a shot just wide. Germany win a free-kick close to the top-left corner of the box, and Kroos looks to shoot ... he tries to fool Cillessen but going inside the near post, but ends up finding the side-netting. Of course it had to be him. I\u2019m surprised that Koeman hasn\u2019t made changes. Anyway, nice from Memphis in midfield, eluding a challenge and looking to play Wijnaldum in, but putting too much on his through-ball. Brilliant ball in from Lewis, out on the left, and Lafferty is across his man ... but put off by the keeper\u2019s charge, flicking across the face of goal. Lafferty is replaced by Boyce. \u201cWell this game is a delight after the torture of Scotland this afternoon,\u201d emails Tony Reekie. \u201cAnd if someone could let us know who is co-commentator on Sky is we\u2019d be very grateful. My father thinks it\u2019s Glenn Hoddle and he\u2019s doing our heads in. He also thinks Koeman\u2019s assistant is Fabio Capello or at the least his brother...\u201d I think it\u2019s Tony Gale, but I might be wrong. It\u2019s gone pretty quiet in both Amsterdam and Belfast. I\u2019d not seen this. Football is so, so good. Craig Cathcart gets underneath a corner and heads high over the bar. De Jong and Wijnaldum snap into Sane, a snapshot that defines the half. Germany replace Goretzka with Gundogan. Northern Ireland make a change, Magennis replacing McGinn. I wonder if Germany regret sitting back and allowing Netherlands onto them. In fairness, the home side are also pressing more and running harder, but they\u2019re having ball and space handed to them. A mess in the box, Depay fighting through a challenge but surrounded. The ball breaks to Wijnaldum,who touches off for his pal, and he shows good composure to plant home an oblique shot across Neuer from close range. That\u2019s eight goals and five assists in his last 12 internationals. Oh yes! What a snap this is! Germany are sitting deeper now, waiting to nail it on the counter. I wonder if Ronald Koeman is thinking about a change. Germany have steadied themselves. In general, they\u2019ve had a bit more midfield class and the legs and skill up front. In Belfast, Northern Ireland are still at it, but Belarus are standing strong. I heartily recommend Slovenia as a holiday destination. Here\u2019s the glorious Lake Bohinj. All square in Ljubljana, a city with some of the greatest ice cream I\u2019ve ever guzzled. Eventually, and after more danger, Sane streaks away with the ball \u2013 and Dumfries nabs him with his third swing. It yields another, and Netherlands are looking good for another goal. Netherlands are moving it much quicker now, Depay and Wijnaldum combining to win a corner. A corner is cleared and finds its way back to the taker, Depay, courtesy of a nice flick from Promes. This time, the cross is a beaut, and De Ligt leaps early and high, contorts his neck, and flings a header into the side-netting. We\u2019ve got ourselves a ball-game! \u201cAs far as I know, there has never been a \u2018Virgil\u2019s World Cup Wind-Ups\u2019,\u201d says Marie Meyer, \u201cand so, therefore, it\u2019s Van Dijk at a canter.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the legend. And back underway in Amsterdam. Back underway in Belfast. \u201cHi, was the WC where Rio \u2018bossed it\u2019 the one where Sol Campbell made the Team of the Tournament and Rio didn\u2019t?\u201d asks Geoff Wignall. I\u2019ve a suspicion he knows the answer to that. I don\u2019t think the official team necessarily has all the answers, but maybe I\u2019m wrong. \u201cVan Nistelrooy was one of the best strikers the Premier League has ever seen,\u201d says Simon Horwell. \u201cHe\u2019s up there with Henry and Shearer. He was certainly a level above Drogba, who was himself a top player. The level of technique he had in his finishing, close-control, volleying, and hold up play was astonishing. Anyone who watched him regularly will also know that, at his peak, he had a ferocious turn of pace, and exceptional dribbling ability. Van Dijk should not be uttered in the same bracket as Ferdinand. A player who produced 8+ years of world class performances. Van Dijk has around 12-18 months of top level performances, and has a long way to go to be considered of the same calibre. Ferdinand and Vidic may well have been the best defensive partnership the premier league has ever seen, but the idea that Vidic did \u201cmost of the work\u201d, is frankly nonsense. Sorry. Their styles were complementary, but individually, Ferdinand is one of the best centre-halves I\u2019ve ever seen play the game. In my football watching time, (mid 80s to present), he\u2019s a top 10 CB.\u201d I agree with almost all of this, and we\u2019ve been watching football roughly the same amount of time. Van Nistelrooy wasn\u2019t as good a player as Henry, who made as many as he scored - though Van Nistelrooy\u2019s European record was outrageous. I agree he was a class above Drogba and also that he was better than Shearer, who I penalise for doing almost nothing in Europe and rarely playing under pressure. Other people might use different criteria to judge, like quality of team-mates and such, and fair enough, but what players did against the best and under the most pressure is important \u201cfor me\u201d. Ferdinand is probably in my top five centre-backs, but in the league, Vidic was so dominant and United were so good that he didn\u2019t have a lot to do a lot of the time. It\u2019s not a criticism, but because his team didn\u2019t have to defend much and because it was his partner\u2019s job to attack the ball, he had a fairly relaxing time of it. I\u2019ll be back presently. Have a look. Poland 0-0 Latvia Cyprus 0-2 Belgium Slovenia 1-0 Macedonia This is a really fun game and Germany have been excellent, too quick and slick for the home side. Koeman has work to do. Northern Ireland will fancy themselves to score another, but a loss of concentration after going ahead has made things more difficult than necessary. \u201cSorry, which world cup did Rio \u2018boss it\u2019?\u201d asks Ben Russell. \u201cThe one where England went out at the quarters as usual?\u201d I think it\u2019s fair to say that he was excellent in it nonetheless. \u201cEvertonians will recognise this as a Koeman side,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor. \u201cA step too slow in foot and brain.\u201d I\u2019ve no idea what Babel is doing in this team. But it\u2019s also fair to praise Germany, who are playing really well and set up to cause maximum aggravation. \u201cWhen I watch VVD play sometimes it looks to me that he is on the ground to teach the kids around him what to do,\u201d says Gokul. \u201cTell the defenders whom to track, midfielders whom to pass etc. Being that casual will lead to that type of goal.\u201d My colleague Paul Doyle once suggested that he finds the game too easy, and I see his point, but I also think that concentrating hard and staying disciplined is a big part of it. Jones gets the ball, turns, dashes, and curls a lovely low cross into the middle but Lafferty can\u2019t quite catch up with it. Israel\u2019s position at the top of a laughably weak pool - Poland, Latvia and Austria are the other teams - is under threat. Well that worked well. Gnabry picks up the ball on the left and Van Dijk is slow to come across - he can, after all, resolve this just by being himself. Except Gnabry scythes across him, steals a yard, and curls an absolute jazzer into the far side-netting! De Ligt has been sent to left centre-back so Van Dijk can handle Sane. Stasevic takes possession on the left, comes inside, and allowed time to shoot, does; the ball flicks off Dallas, loops over Peacock-Farrell, and that\u2019s how quickly things can go wrong. \u201cBefore the word was hijacked, Holland were the ultimate hipsters,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor. \u201cNow, instead of Jonny Rep and Johan Neeskens, we have Memphis Depay and Ryan Babel. You don\u2019t need to be Einstein to see that as a relative decline.\u201d Almost anyone would be a relative decline, but it\u2019s also true that these aren\u2019t as good as Van Basten, Bergkamp and others either. A corner goes short and McGinn crosses; at the near post, Davis flicks on and Evans plants a header past Klimovich. Northern Ireland have worked for that. Another save from Neuer! Promes bends over a fine cross and Babel runs off Kehrer who I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. Again, the contact is decent but the direction isn\u2019t, and the keeper beats away one he should never have smelled. I daresay Belgium win this one. Saved Neuer! A long ball down the right, De Roon to Depay, is cleverly flicked on, and Promes then pokes through to Babel. He could take a moment to think but instead punches a hard sidefooter that rises nicely for the keeper, who gets more than enough on it. \u201cRio was so good that one season he did not concede a single free-kick,\u201d emails Duncan Edwards. \u201cThink about it, he was so good he didn\u2019t need to resort to any fouls at all.\u201d Can that really be true? No bookings, I can have, but that doesn\u2019t sound quite right to me. He did also have the good fortune to play next to Nemanja Vidic, who did most of the fouling and, let\u2019s be real, most of the work. I read today that Didier Drogba was quicker than Van Nistelrooy, with better hold-up play and was generally better - he was picked ahead of him for the BBC\u2019s Premier League-era foreigners XI. Because of how many he scored and how much pleasure he took in scoring them, people remember Van Nistelrooy as a predator, which isn\u2019t really true. He was a predator, but he was lots of other things too, and made his own goals as well as scavenging in the six-yard box. \u201cThat Euro88 link sent me off down the YouTube wormhole\u201d, tweets AsNaturalAsRain. \u201cNot that there\u2019s an actual debate about RVN vs PVH, but do you remember this piece of absolute filth from Van Nistelrooy? That 2008 team were a delight to watch. Uff marone! This could be the first of a few. I\u2019m half-expecting Lukaku to stat-pad even though he\u2019s at home, injured. You\u2019ve got to say, Jogi Low\u2019s tactics have been spot-on so far, the roving forwards proving pretty tricky to mark. This is a gorgeous goal. Kroos takes the ball on halfway, bursts past his man - ! - and sends Schulz away down the left. He crosses and Sane screeches across De Ligt, who falls over in time to watch a fine first touch and finish, belted across Cillessen into the far side-netting. De Jong gives it away in centrefield and Kimmich breaks towards the Dutch box. He should shoot but tries to skirt the final man, which allows De Jong to atone for his error via immaculate slide-tackle. \u201cWhy compare Van Dijk to Rio?\u201d asks Noel Figueiredo. \u201cDoes anyone compare Kane to Cruyff? (With all apologies to those who require it.)\u201d I guess because I keep hearing and reading pundits say that Van Dijk is the best or among the best of the Premier League era. I think we\u2019re going to stop timestamping minutes, given the games didn\u2019t start simultaneously. 8 min \u201cPierre van Hooijdonk would certainly know all about the bending of space and time,\u201d emails Charles Antaki. \u201cHe was experimenting with it scientifically while on strike at Forest, successfully being in a different space and having no time for the manager.\u201d Relatively speaking, he had better things to do. 6 min Germany win a corner down the right, which Van Dijk nuts away in short order. 6 min No goals in any of tonight\u2019s games so far. 6 min In Belfast, Northern Ireland have started well enough but Belarus look sharp on the counter and a whole lot better than Estonia, who were scraped by the other night. 4 min 3 min Germany - \u201cthe Germans\u201d - have started well. 2 min Lovely from Germany, Gnabry feeding Sane down the left, taking the return in the middle and skating across Blind before swivelling into a low shot that Cillessen shoves away at his near post. 2 min Van Dijk - and De Ligt - might find it an interesting night against Gnabry and Sane, who have pace, trickery and movement. 1 min We\u2019re away at the JoCro, as no one calls it. Shall we talk about Virgil van Dijk? Very good, yes, but still to do very much relative to those we\u2019re told he\u2019s as good as. By his age, Rio Ferdinand had won a league title and bossed it at a World Cup, and went on to win five more leagues and a Champions League. Van Dijk has work to do. The Dutch give their anthem plenty; Daley Blind is such a dish. Pick that non sequitur out. Tony Gayle thinks it\u2019s a good thing that Dutch football is on the up. Great stuff. The players are out in Belfast and Dam. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Denzel Dumfries does tonight, mainly because Denzel Dumfries is an absolutely majestic name. Cyprus: Pardo, Kousoulos, Junior, Merkis, Laifis, Papoulis, Marga\u00e7a, Artymatas, Ioannou, Antoniou, Efrem. Belgium: Courtois, Vertonghen, Vermaelen, Alderweireld, Dendoncker, Tielemans, Thorgan, Castagne, Hazard, Mertens, Batshuayi. Already today: Scotland won in San Marino, which really showed everyone; Israel beat Austria 4-2; Hungary came from behind to beat Croatia 2-1. And this. Also a Sunday night, as I recall. What a game this was. Michael O\u2019Neill tells Sky that his team are unchanged because there was no need to change it. More as I get it. I\u2019m delighted to report that my SkyGo isn\u2019t working, so please bear with me while I resolve things. And there\u2019s more! \u201cInstead of discussing the Dutch game plan,\u201d tweets De Voorzitter, \u201c Pierre van Hooijdonk is explaining general relativity to the Dutch tv audience.\u201d In tribute to Cruyff, no doubt. Maybe I\u2019m misremembering a grudge, but was there a time he was picked ahead of Van Nistelrooy? Back to the main e-vent, today is the yahrzeit of the genius, Johan Cruyff, may his memory be for a blessing. One of very few footballers who changed the game and more than that, changed the world, everything we see tonight and always is in some small or large way thanks to him. A hero. Northern Ireland (a 4-3-3 so it is): Peacock-Farrell; Dallas, Cathcart, Evans, Lewis; McNair, Davis, Saville; McGinn, Lafferty, Jones. Subs: McGovern. Hazard, McLaughlin, Flanagan, McAuley, Hughes, Ferguson, Thompson, Magennis, Smyth, Boyce, Washington. Belarus (also a 4-3-3): Klimovich, Dragun, Martynovich, Sivakov, Volodko, Maevki, Shitov, Savitskiy, Hleb, Stasevich, Laptev. Subs: Gorbunov, Rios, Kendysh, Volkov, Nekhajchik, Polyakov, Kislyak, Signevich, Chichkan, Saroka, Kovalev, Putilo Overpopulated dugouts aside, I\u2019m buzzing for this. The Dutch are just a little bit into an upswing, so are playing with confidence. I\u2019m excited for another look at De Ligt and De Jong, and hoping Bergwijn gets a run at some point. As for Germany, they\u2019re guessing, basically. Kimmich, Goretzka and Sane might be special, but the rest? I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d like to see what Tah can do, and I\u2019d have gone for Reus ahead of Gnabry, but here we are. I almost got onto both benches Netherlands (a classical 3-5-2): Cillessen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Blind; De Roon, Wijnaldum, De Jong F; Promes, Memphis, Babel. Subs: Berghuis, Bizot, Ake, Bergwijn, Roasario, Van de Beek, Strootman, Van Aanholt, De Jong L, Vilhena, Zoet, Hateboer. Germany (a desperate 3-1-4-2): Neuer; Sule, Ginter, Rudiger; Kimmich; Kehrer, Goretzka, Kroos, Schulz; Gnabry, Sane. Subs: Ter Stegen, Gundogan, Reus, Havertz, Eggestein, Werner, Tah, Brandt, Halstenberg, Trapp, Stark. Sometimes you really don\u2019t need to say anything. Obviously you still do anyway because what else are you gonna do, but if you didn\u2019t, no one would mind. Such is Netherlands v Germany, the classic match of international football and which arrives for our delectation this evening. More history than Ken and Deirdre, more class than Debbie Greenwood and more needle than Cleopatra, there is no fixture that comes close to its rich tapestry of everything. And, on top of that, we\u2019ve also got Northern Ireland v Belarus, Cyprus v Belgium, Slovenia v North Macedonia and more. Long story short: it\u2019s better than Antiques Roadshow. Kick-offs: 7.45pm GMT"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
