The reputation was exaggerated in both cases. Yet it also contained some truth. Without the focus and skills of the strategist who became known to headline writers as Bush's Brain, George Bush would probably not be in the White House today. Mr Bush did not win the popular vote in 2000, but Mr Rove crafted a centre-right campaign for him which ran Al Gore so close that the prize finally fell within the Republicans' grasp. In the 2002 midterms after 9/11, and once more in the 2004 presidential contest against John Kerry, Mr Rove out-thought and outfought the Democrats again, often dirtily and never nicely, but always audaciously and to great effect at the ballot box. Mr Rove is not a conservative to rank alongside Bismarck, but yesterday's announcement that he will step down from the Bush administration at the end of this month is nevertheless a dropping-the-pilot moment. For good and ill, the master strategist is a central figure in modern American politics. Every candidate has one. Yet few of them aim as high as Mr Rove. Consultants like Pat Caddell, Lee Atwater, James Carville and Dick Morris played big roles in presidential campaigns long before Mr Rove rose to fame. But whereas an Atwater or a Morris was primarily a political technocrat, devising clever strategies and crafting innovative tactics, Mr Rove had grander ambitions. He had all the technical skills, including some very crude and ruthless ones; and Mr Rove's attention to micro-targeting within the electorate is a technique which campaigners have adopted across the world. But he was above all a conservative ideologist in a sense which few predecessor consultants could claim to be. Steeped in American (and European) political history, Mr Rove had a vision of Mr Bush as the candidate who could change his nation, creating a lasting era of majority Republican dominance in American politics in which the country would be reshaped in the conservative mould. In Texas and then on the national stage, he shaped Mr Bush into a personable \"compassionate conservative\" candidate who would nevertheless be ruthlessly ideological in office. His plan was to add to the Republican party's conservative base by attracting new kinds of support, especially among black and Hispanic voters. He promised inclusive \"unite-not-divide\" policies like \"no child left behind\" and faith-based community initiatives. Mr Bush's early successes quickly turned Mr Rove into a global political legend. In the end, though, Mr Rove has failed. He has failed because he was only interested in winning 51% of the votes. Having won them, he wanted Mr Bush to govern America (and even the world) with pure self-interest. For a while that is what Mr Bush did. Everything about the federal government was politicised, boosted by the post-9/11 mood. But the mounting evidence of failure in Iraq, a succession of partisan scandals and the administration's indifference to Hurricane Katrina wrecked Mr Bush's standing among non-aligned voters and alarmed the dwindling minority of liberal Republican voters. The electorate revolted. Mr Rove became the Democrats' hate figure. After the 2006 elections, the whole Rove strategy of engineering a paradigm shift towards hegemonic conservative government appears in ruins. That is why Mr Rove is going. He is not going because he is tired but because the Bush administration, rooted in the dogma that there was only one true way of doing things and that all compromise with other views is to be scorned, has proved to be disastrous both in and for America. If the voters hold their nerve then Mr Rove's legacy may not be the triumph of American conservatism but its humbling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
