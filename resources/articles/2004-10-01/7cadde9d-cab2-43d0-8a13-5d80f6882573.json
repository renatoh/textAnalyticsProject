Leicester say they will not rush into appointing a long-term replacement. Among those considered possible successors is the former City striker Mike Newell, whose Luton Town team are blazing a spectacular trail in League One. Adams' departure was an unexpected development. His team had made a disappointing start to the season - they are 12th in the Championship, having been favourites to win it, with only one victory from six league games at home - but he enjoyed the full support of the board of directors. According to City's chief executive Tim Davies, they had spent the past few days trying to persuade Adams to stay on. \"It's a very sad day for the club. Micky's an honourable and decent man, whose record speaks for itself,\" said Davies. \"Hopefully my leaving will take the shackles off and [the players] can express themselves, gel into a good team for the new manager,\" Adams said. He had offered to resign after three City players were charged in connection with allegations of sexual assault while on a mid-season break at La Manga this year. All were cleared, but Adams admitted yesterday the case had taken its toll. \"I tried to put a brave front on it, kid people we could come through it unaffected, but we didn't.\" Coventry have signed Tottenham's midfielder Rohan Ricketts on a month's loan. Malcolm Glazer and his family have offered JP McManus and John Magnier 300p a share for their near 30% stake in Manchester United. At that price, the club would be valued at \u00a3786m. The proposal was made last Friday, according to sources close to the possible deal. The Irish investors have apparently set their minimum price at 310p, with the deal likely either to succeed or fail this week. \"With the Irish stake, there is a deal; without it there is not,\" said one City source. Because the Glazer family trust already owns almost 20% of United's shares, the American will effectively take control of the club if the Irishmen decide to sell. Fans' groups are hoping that the Irish will fulfil their promise to be long-term investors and wait to see if a counter-bid will emerge. Hopes appear to be pinned on the investment banker Keith Harris, who is said to be trying to build a consortium of potential investors. Meanwhile the fans group Shareholders United is threatening to boycott the sale of replica shirts in protest at the planned Glazer takeover. And the Conservative MPs Chris Grayling and Alistair Burt have tabled a parliamentary motion expressing concern at the possibility of the takeover. They want Glazer to \"clearly demonstrate that he would strengthen rather than weaken the club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
