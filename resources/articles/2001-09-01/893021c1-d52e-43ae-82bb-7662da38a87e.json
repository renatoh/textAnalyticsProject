Some 1,000 Manchester United fans were in Greece for the Champions League Group G match against Olympiakos Piraeus, and Leeds took 130 fans on its official trip for tonight's Uefa Cup match against Maritimo in Madeira. A small number of Hibernian fans had travelled to Athens for the Uefa Cup match against AEK and are also likely to receive some kind of compensation. The Uefa Cup matches have been provisionally rescheduled for next Thursday, the Champions League games for October 10. Announcing the decision, Uefa's chief executive Gerhard Aigner said: \"We will continue to monitor the overall security situation within Europe and will make a further statement concerning the rescheduling of these matches.\" Peter Kenyon, Manchester United's chief executive, said: \"Postponement is the right decision. About 1,000 of our fans travelled out to Athens and we'll look to help them financially wherever we can.\" Leeds' first venture back into Europe since last season's unexpected trek to the Champions League semi-finals lasted all of 10 minutes yesterday when their flight from Bradford turned back having barely made it out of Yorkshire. The club chairman Peter Ridsdale was quick to back Uefa's decision and promised: \"We will ensure that all fans on the official Leeds trip will be recompensed by the club. [As for] anyone who went under their own steam, if they submit verifiable expenditure, we will help them pursue compensation through Uefa.\" Uefa is looking to compensate smaller clubs in the Uefa Cup for wasted trips but feels the rich clubs in the Champions League can stand the loss. The other English and Scottish clubs in Europe were not severely affected. Chelsea, Ipswich, Aston Villa and Kilmarnock all had home ties along with Celtic in the Champions League, who were due to play Rosenborg. The Rangers chairman David Murray had already pulled his side out of the Uefa Cup tie against Anzhi Makhachkala in Dagestan over security worries though yesterday the club lost their appeal over a neutral venue. All last night's Worthington Cup matches went ahead, with the weekend's Premiership fixtures likely to open with a minute's silence and all players in black armbands. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
