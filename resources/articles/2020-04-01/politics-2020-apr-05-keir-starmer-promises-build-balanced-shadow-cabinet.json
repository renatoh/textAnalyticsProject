A day after winning the contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer also said Labour must prepare to help reshape a very different political world after the coronavirus pandemic. His camp was expected to start unveiling senior shadow ministers on Sunday afternoon, with MPs including Anneliese Dodds, Jo Stevens and Nick Thomas-Symonds widely tipped for top jobs. Asked about possible candidates on BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Starmer said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into individual names. But it will be balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country. And of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity.\u201d Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels. \u201cI will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It\u2019ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking back, we\u2019re not badging people by the past. We\u2019re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.\u201d The former shadow Brexit secretary, who was director of public prosecutions before entering parliament, faces a difficult first task of unifying Labour around a new shadow cabinet, including how to bring in MPs who felt shut out under Corbyn without alienating Corbyn\u2019s remaining supporters. Starmer told Marr that significant change was needed. \u201cWe just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don\u2019t change we will lose the next general election.\u201d He has pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to the pandemic while asking \u201cdifficult questions\u201d when needed. Noting that he was taking over Labour in a \u201ccompletely different world\u201d even from December\u2019s general election due to coronavirus, Starmer pledged to battle for a fairer economic outcome, saying it appeared inevitable that richer people and corporations would need to pay more tax in the coming years. He said it would be unthinkable to respond in the way the government did after the banking crash, with renewed austerity focused disproportionately on poorer people. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is go back to business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change. They were last and now they\u2019ve got to be first.\u201d Starmer declined to say it was inevitable that the government needed to extend the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, saying only that ministers should \u201cextend it if it\u2019s necessary to do so\u201d, but he said the hard deadline had been an error. \u201cI\u2019ve always said I think that 12 months is going to be very tight,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the government made a mistake putting dates into legislation. It\u2019s nearly always a mistake to put a date into legislation, because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d As an example of changes he would make in Labour, Starmer singled out his pledges to remove antisemitism from the party, noting that this had been one of the first issues he discussed after being elected. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road, it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work, but I hope I put in at least the first steps yesterday,\u201d he said. Success on the issue would be judged, he added, \u201cby the return of Jewish members to our party\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
