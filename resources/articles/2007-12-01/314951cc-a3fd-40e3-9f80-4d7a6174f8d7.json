Lee Myung-bak, the Grand National party candidate and former mayor of Seoul, is expected to take a tougher line on North Korea and strengthen ties with the US after his inauguration early next year. With 90% of the vote counted, Lee - who celebrated his 66th birthday yesterday - secured 48.1% of the vote. His nearest rival, liberal Chung Dong-young, trailed behind with 26.7%. This is the biggest margin of victory since democratic elections began 20 years ago. \"Today, the people gave me absolute support. I'm well aware of the people's wishes,\" said Lee. \"I will serve the people in a very humble way. According to the people's wishes, I will save the nation's economy that faces a crisis.\" Nicknamed \"the bulldozer\" for his ability to push through policies, Lee has promised to boost economic growth to 7%, double average incomes to $40,000 (\u00a320,000) and make South Korea one of the world's top seven economies. It is currently 13th. This so-called \"747\" pledge has struck a chord with a nation suffering rising unemployment, high property prices and a growing income gap. Surveys show more than 70% of voters are disillusioned with the current president, Roh Moo-hyun, who is seen as ineffective despite economic growth of more than 4% a year since he came to power in 2002. Most developed nations would be delighted with this figure, but many South Koreans look back fondly to a period of supercharged expansion. \"This reflects Koreans' nostalgic sentiment towards the rapid economic growth in the 1970s,\" said Kim Ki-jung, a professor at Yonsei University. \"Lee Myung-bak and the Grand National party have successfully tapped into the long-held jackpot dream of Koreans.\" Lee could enter the Blue House presidential mansion with a fraud investigation hanging over him. Opponents have linked him to a former business partner who has been extradited from the US to face charges of embezzlement, forgery and stock manipulation. MPs fought in parliament over opposition demands for an inquiry, which Lee has been forced to accept. In an old video released in the final week of the campaign, Lee said he founded the company at the centre of the investigation. Under Korean law, presidents are immune from prosecution on most criminal charges, but Lee could face an investigation by independent counsel. In relations with North Korea, Lee is expected to attach more conditions to aid, including denuclearisation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
