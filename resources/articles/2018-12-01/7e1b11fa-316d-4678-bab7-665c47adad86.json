Village Roadshow has been a prolific donor to the Liberals and Labor in the past two decades, and its contributions appear to peak during major debates about Australia\u2019s copyright laws and online piracy. By far the biggest yearly contribution ($1.2m) was made in 2015-16, at roughly the same time Australia\u2019s parliament passed a major piece of legislation curbing online piracy. On Wednesday, the Senate passed new powers allowing copyright owners to more easily block overseas piracy websites and force search engines to eliminate blocked pages from their results. The measures were supported by authors, screenwriters and musicians but criticised by Google, digital rights groups and copyright experts, who feared the legislation was so broad that it could threaten more innocent sites, such as meme-generators. Village, one of the bill\u2019s key backers, refused to tell Guardian Australia how much it donated to the parties in the months leading up to debate. Australia\u2019s weak and sluggish donation disclosure requirements mean their contributions for 2017-18 will remain secret until at least February. The Queensland University of Technology intellectual property and innovation law expert Matthew Rimmer said that made it impossible for the public to tell how Village may have attempted to influence the process. \u201cWe should have real-time disclosure of donations,\u201d Rimmer, a critic of the bill, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know at the moment whether Roadshow or other copyright owners contributed to the Coalition, ALP, Centre Alliance and the Greens. We don\u2019t know whether ISPs and search engines made political donations to try to stop the bill.\u201d A Village Roadshow spokeswoman said the company complied with all donation disclosure laws. \u201cVillage Roadshow does not comment on its political donations but would point out that the legislation referred to was passed with bipartisan support,\u201d she said. The fight against piracy \u2013 which has a significant impact on Australia\u2019s creative industries \u2013 typically enjoys widespread support in parliament. The Labor MP Ed Husic offered a rare criticism last month, saying the new measures were unlikely to have any practical impact on piracy. He said no one supported piracy, but accused \u201cbloated, greedy, resistant-to-change rights holders\u201d of failing to reform themselves to better cater to consumers. Husic alluded to the impact of donations when saying parliament needed to keep the rights of consumers in mind. \u201cAs lawmakers, just because we might get a selfie with Richard Roxburgh \u2014 I love Rake as much as anyone else \u2014 or a political party gets a donation from a rights holder, does not mean that we should stop looking at how to make the types of reforms that balance the needs of creatives and the needs of producers versus the needs of consumers,\u201d Husic said. The lobbying expert and University of Melbourne academic George Rennie said donations at the scale of Village Roadshow\u2019s clearly bought access and influence. \u201cYou might say that the policy is reasonable,\u201d Rennie told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut it is that ultimate question of what is the reasonable policy that gets up. And the reasonable policy that gets up is almost always really monetarily well-backed.\u201d In its submission supporting the legislation, Village said despite the 2015 crackdown, search engines such as Google were still helping internet users find pirated content. \u201cThe effects of piracy are shocking to our Australian employment, economy and way of life,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe Australian film industry is critical to what we are as Australians.\u201d But the Australian Digital Alliance, which represents copyright users, said the bill was rushed, flawed and \u201cworryingly broad and vague\u201d. ADA executive director, Jessica Coates, said it potentially allowed for the blocking of innocent sites, including meme-generators. \u201cIts new \u2018primary effect\u2019 test significantly broadens its scope far beyond the piracy sites that were originally envisioned, and runs the risk of enabling the blocking of a large range of innocent and commonly used websites, such as meme-generators, auto-translation services and even VPNs,\u201d Coates said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a significant departure from the stated intent of the scheme when it passed in 2015, which was to capture only \u2018the worst of the worst\u2019 websites.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
