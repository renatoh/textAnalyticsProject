As the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, talked of \u201cmomentum\u201d behind Project Restart and new medical protocols were submitted to the government, there was a sense the top flight might finally be coalescing around an approach for resumption. But after the fifth shareholders\u2019 meeting since play was suspended in March plans still remain incomplete and, for the first time, the possibility of curtailing the season was discussed openly by clubs. On Monday the government revealed its plans for easing the coronavirus lockdown. They included the possible resumption of \u201ccultural and sporting events\u201d which could \u201ctake place behind closed-doors for broadcast, while avoiding the risk of large-scale social contact\u201d. This would not be before 1 June and would be dependent on meeting the government\u2019s five tests for reducing the spread of the virus. The Premier League learned of the plans just as their shareholders\u2019 meeting was coming to a close. The issue of playing matches at neutral venues and preventing crowds gathering at grounds was the greatest sticking point. Clubs in the bottom six were against neutral venues, claiming the absence of home advantage would distort the competition and other clubs, Newcastle being one, were against it too. At the meeting, it was decided the idea could be revisited. \u201cI think everybody would prefer to play home and away if at all possible,\u201d Masters said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s clear to see that some clubs feel more strongly about that than others. We\u2019ve been talking to the authorities about the conditions in which we could get the Premier League back up and running and taking all that advice on board. But it is an ongoing dialogue. \u201cI think some of our clubs would argue that, in relation to policing their own fans, they have a good relationship with them and they\u2019re in a better position to control that. But this has to be a decision that\u2019s come to mutually.\u201d Clubs are expected to have local discussions about the possibility of putting on games at their own grounds. It is one of a number of pieces of continuing work; the most important remains agreeing medical protocols for, in the first instance, the safe return of training. The medical protocols have been worked on in conjunction with club doctors, some of whom have expressed concern about the contents, and on Monday they were presented to club officials. The League Managers Association and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association were also briefed and the protocols submitted to the government for their approval, with the expectation the further amendments may still be possible. For example, the league is yet to devise a protocol for practising safe contact training. A meeting with players is to follow on Thursday, getting their consent another huge component in keeping the plans for a restart on the road. \u201cClubs are determined as part of the consultation process that [players\u2019] concerns and questions are heard. They will be later this week,\u201d Masters said. \u201cWe\u2019re really just talking about return to training protocols. In isolation it\u2019s a big decision. But the players have to be consulted properly.\u201d Asked if it were possible that players could veto plans agreed by clubs, Masters said: \u201cWe are not anticipating it and obviously, what we are trying to do is create the safest possible environment for a return to training for players, for managers, for their coaches and the other staff that need to be involved. We think we are going to be able to create that safe environment.\u201d Masters admitted, however, that the possibility of the season not being completed had been discussed by clubs and that the path towards any matches remained difficult. \u201cIt was discussed for the first time but the contents of that discussion have to remain confidential. What I can say is that all of the talk was about finishing the season. No conclusions were reached on any other models. Those are future conversations we may need to have.\u201d The prospective restart of matches has long been pegged to early June in discussions, but when asked if he thought these dates were still on course to be met, Masters demurred. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t want to make a prediction now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many steps to be taken, many hurdles to get over before we get to that point. It\u2019s too early for us to talk about it. \u201cWe want to remain in step with government and the authorities, and we want to remain in step with the mood of football supporters. I think really the talk at the moment should be about the tentative steps we are taking now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
