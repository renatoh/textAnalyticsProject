Since the regulations came into force four weeks ago, many members of the public now believe they are entitled to far higher compensation payouts than the rules allow, causing difficulties for airlines. Airline watchdog the Air Transport Users Council (AUC), has been bombarded with hundreds of complaints from disgruntled passengers who mistakenly believe they are entitled to compensation for any flight delays. However, the new rules make it clear that airlines only need to provide meals and refreshments for delayed flights after a minimum of two hours. Payments kick in after five hours, when passengers are entitled to a refund if they decide not to travel. However, many passengers also mistakenly expect a full refund and a free flight. Several travel bodies such as the Association of British Travel Agents and the Federation of Tour Operators, which represents the major holiday companies and charter air lines, have complained to the Commission, accusing it of getting its facts wrong following what they describe as misleading advice on its website and posters in airports. \"There is a lot of confusion over this law because it has been so badly drafted,\" said AUC chief executive Simon Evans. He confirmed that the publicity surrounding the new rules had made people more aware of their rights, but inaccurate reporting had given travellers inflated views of what to expect. \"We have had reports of check-in staff being afraid to go to work because of this,\" he said. Evans cited one example where a passenger had rung the AUC from a departure lounge, complaining that his flight was 10 minutes late and asking when he would be offered compensation. Airlines are also required to compensate travellers for flight cancellations, but are not obliged to pay out if they can claim unavoidable \"extraordinary circumstances\" such as bad weather, political instability, strikes or security risks. But the AUC is concerned that more airlines seem to be citing extraordinary circumstances in borderline situations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
