It was 16 and a half pounds (7.5kg), she says, her eyes glittering. \u201cI wrote more,\u201d she says. \u201cWe cut a lot.\u201d Her then editor made her take out a whole chapter \u2013 the one that followed her character Blackie O\u2019Neill through the first world war (he was a friend to the book\u2019s heroine, the kitchen maid turned retail tycoon Emma Harte). \u201cI really fought this. But she took it out, and I was infuriated.\u201d It occurs to Bradford, with the 40th anniversary edition of the book on the table in front of us, that the chapter might have made its way back in. \u201cI never thought of looking,\u201d she says, flicking through the 800-plus pages, then she starts reading aloud. She looks up and says excitedly: \u201cWhat a good beginning!\u201d Then she goes back to it. Goodness, I think, she\u2019s going to read the whole thing. A well-timed waiter comes to our table at the Dorchester hotel to pour tea; she closes the book, greets him by name and they have a chat. Bradford is fantastic company. She fizzes with charisma, and because she seems to enjoy talking about herself, she makes a great interviewee, although \u2013 storyteller that she is \u2013 she can go on. Try to get her off a subject and she\u2019ll solicitously pause to answer, then pick up where she left off. She is 86 and looks glorious. Her hair is beautifully styled, her eyes as sparkly as her jewellery. It feels as if there is no subject off-limits. Ask her about the sex scenes in her latest book \u2013 her women are as lustful as the male characters \u2013 and she smiles and says: \u201cOh, I love sex, don\u2019t you?\u201d The only subject she won\u2019t talk about is politics, at the request of her publisher who once received a letter from a reader who said she\u2019d never buy another Barbara Taylor Bradford book again after Bradford said nice things about Theresa May in an interview. (Bradford\u2019s heroine is Margaret Thatcher; in the US, where she has lived since the 60s, she is a Republican.) Surely she must have stories about Donald Trump? Didn\u2019t they mix in the same wealthy New York circles? (Bradford is worth a reported \u00a3160m.) \u201cHe lent us his boardroom,\u201d she says, referring to her charity work. \u201cHe was normal, he was nice. I think it\u2019s when he gets in front of a microphone he starts to \u2026\u201d For the first time, she doesn\u2019t finish a sentence. The day we speak, it has been announced that Bradford is to revisit A Woman of Substance in the form of a prequel, although we are meeting because she has written another book, In the Lion\u2019s Den, which she wrote in a year. It is Bradford\u2019s 34th book, and the second part of a trilogy, following James Falconer, a barrow boy turned businessman. She was scheduled to write the third book next, but suddenly it was beyond her \u2013 in July, Robert Bradford, her husband of 55 years, died after a stroke. \u201cI knew that he wasn\u2019t going to live and [I was thinking] how would I cope with all that was going to happen?\u201d she says. She sat by his bed, in shock, for the week he was in hospital, and in the quiet of the room worked out the storyline of her prequel to A Woman of Substance. Next month, she will get to work on it. In preparation, she reread every book Blackie and Emma appeared in or were mentioned in (there are several). \u201cWhen I read [her 1988 novel] To Be the Best, I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d written it and I couldn\u2019t help but think what a good book this is,\u201d she says with a laugh, then adds, \u201cand very sexy! And all I could think at the end was these women are all working hard. They\u2019re all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I\u2019ve written about myself in every book.\u201d She looks thrilled with the discovery. Bradford was brought up in a suburb of Leeds, a cherished only child (her older brother died before she was born). Her father was an engineer, and her mother took charge of her development, encouraging her to read Dickens and others. A biography of Bradford, published a few years ago, came up with the tantalising idea that her mother was the illegitimate daughter of a local marquis. When Bradford was 10, her mother sent one of Bradford\u2019s stories off to a magazine, and \u2013 after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it \u2013 she was hooked. At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but persuaded the editor to take her on as a reporter. At 18, she was editing its women\u2019s pages, and at 20 she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \u201cI was very, very driven from the age of 10. That\u2019s what I wanted to be \u2013 a reporter,\u201d she says. She met Bob on a blind date in 1961, and they married two years later. He was \u201cmovie-star gorgeous\u201d, she says, and was already a rich and successful film producer. She moved with him back to New York, and started writing novels. Between them, they amassed a fortune \u2013 Bob turned Bradford\u2019s books into films and miniseries, and, she says, shepherded her career. \u201cHe was building a brand. He believed you promote a book like you promote a movie.\u201d All her books are dedicated to him. There are fabulous, although untrue, stories about the couple\u2019s lavish lifestyle \u2013 including one that they heated the lake of their Connecticut home to keep their swans warm. Were they driven by making money? \u201cWell, everybody likes money,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to get paid for what you do, but I think it was the enjoyment of working together. I think it was the love of writing and [his] love of making movies.\u201d What was her biggest extravagance? \u201cMaybe at one time when Oscar de la Renta was doing the collections for Balmain, Bob \u2013 having grown up in France \u2013 loved couture, so he thought nothing of buying me some nice things that were very expensive. But I\u2019ve still got them.\u201d He was always buying her jewellery \u2013 some of which she is planning to sell at auction (the last time she did this, in 2013, she made more than \u00a31m). Bradford could have afforded to retire years ago, but says she will write until she can\u2019t do it any longer. She writes in longhand or on an electric typewriter. Since having had a hip replacement in August, she has been told not to spend so much time sitting down so she sets an alarm clock to go off every two hours to remind her to walk around. \u201cWhat happens is I become so immersed in what I\u2019m doing that any pain that I have goes away,\u201d she says. Before that, she would start work at 5.30am and work until lunch, and then again until about 4pm. I tell her that I read the romantic novelist Danielle Steel sometimes works 22 hours a day. \u201cOh, bullshit,\u201d says Bradford. She is not dogged by self-doubt, and rarely has writer\u2019s block. If she does, she will simply power through (or perhaps take a break \u201cfor an hour or two\u201d). And she has ideas for books all the time. \u201cI could give you four here out of my head now,\u201d she says. Bradford is a curious mix of staunch feminist \u2013 her heroines are headstrong, independent women \u2013 while admitting that at home, her husband \u201cwore the trousers; he was very much the boss\u201d. This romantic novelist \u2013 she would narrow her eyes at that description \u2013 worries that the #MeToo movement has made men wary of women. \u201cI\u2019m glad somebody had the guts to come and start talking about Harvey Weinstein,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, somehow, it has gone a bit over the top. I can\u2019t explain it. But there are decent men out there \u2013 they\u2019re not all monsters \u2013 and I think a lot of decent men don\u2019t want to be alone with a woman. They think they might get falsely charged. I\u2019m glad it happened, but I think it ought to sort of stop.\u201d In her latest book, Alexis Malvern is an heiress to a property company and, after the death of her fiance, gets back to work. \u201cI do think women work hard, and I think women deserve to \u2013 what is it called? \u2013 break the glass ceiling. I\u2019m a great believer in women being paid the same as men. The problem is, whatever we do and however good we are, somehow, it is still a man\u2019s world.\u201d We know Alexis is suffering because \u2013 horror \u2013 she becomes fat. Does Bradford think it\u2019s important for women to be thin and pretty? \u201cI personally have never been made up and dressed up for a man,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been made up and dressed properly for me, to make the best of what I have. I don\u2019t like to tell women what to do, but I think it\u2019s a good idea to try to look nice. It cheers me up.\u201d Bob liked it, too, she adds. Everything comes back to Bob. They didn\u2019t have children \u2013 Bradford had a couple of miscarriages, but wasn\u2019t interested in seeking medical assistance to become a mother. Why did their marriage survive more than half a century? \u201cI think that you can\u2019t just be in love with someone because that changes, [although] Bob and I never lost any of our sexual drive for many years. I think it\u2019s because we thought alike in many ways. We had different views about some things, but we got along very well, we were very compatible. He was good at giving me my space to write. We liked each other, we loved each other. And I think respect is important.\u201d How has she coped with losing him? \u201cWhen people ask me that, I do start to cry,\u201d she says and her eyes suddenly brim with tears. \u201cI\u2019m lonely without him.\u201d She takes a breath, her voice airless. \u201cIt\u2019s like half of me has been chopped off. I was married to him for 55 years and I knew him for two years before that, and he was a very dominant presence. He had a great personality and very dry humour. I used to say to him: \u2018You make me laugh every day.\u2019 We were sort of joined at the hip. And he was my best friend. When I went into his den, his face would light up. So I miss that.\u201d His death was shocking \u2013 Bob, who at 94 had been perfectly well, had a stroke one night in July, and went into hospital. Three days later, on a Friday, doctors told Bradford he wouldn\u2019t recover. She talks in great detail about those frantic days, reliving it, from the nights in the hospital room by his bed, to picking out his plot in the cemetery. \u201cI\u2019d do this,\u201d she says, taking my hand, \u201cand he\u2019d do this.\u201d She squeezes my hand. \u201cIt was a tight grip, although not so much by Thursday.\u201d She knew that at some point after his death she would be getting back to work. \u201cBob had drilled it into me for the last 20 years: \u2018If anything happens to me, don\u2019t stop working. You\u2019ve got a God-given gift. You can sit down at your desk and write a book that people want to read. And it gives you great solace.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to talk about that. I\u2019d say: \u2018No, nothing\u2019s going to happen to you.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe it has only been four months since he died. Bradford seems so together. \u201cI\u2019m wearing my public face,\u201d she says with a sad smile. \u201cI always cry a bit when I go to bed at night.\u201d At first, she says, \u201cI was so shocked and so exhausted and I cried myself to sleep at night. And there\u2019s only so many tears in the end, you\u2019ve just got to get on with it. You\u2019ve got to gather your sword, stand up and go out and fight. He wouldn\u2019t want me to crumble like some stupid, silly woman.\u201d I wonder if it has made her more aware of her own mortality and she instantly says, \u201cNo,\u201d as if it\u2019s unthinkable that something as trivial as death could stop her. \u201cI mean yes and no. I say to people: \u2018I\u2019m not going to die yet.\u2019 All I wanted to do was go and lie in his plot next to him for quite a few weeks. But I guess if you\u2019re a practical, down-to-earth Yorkshirewoman \u2026 we\u2019re rather stoical, and I\u2019m strong. I\u2019ve always had a backbone of steel. I\u2019ve gone through all sorts of things and come out the other end.\u201d I think about what she had said earlier about how all her irrepressible, tough characters are based on herself, and it feels as if she is writing the end to her own story \u2013 not a happy ending, exactly, but one in which the heroine refuses to give up. Barbara Taylor Bradford\u2019s In the Lion\u2019s Den (HarperCollins, \u00a316.99) and the 40th anniversary edition of A Woman of Substance (\u00a38.99) are both available now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
