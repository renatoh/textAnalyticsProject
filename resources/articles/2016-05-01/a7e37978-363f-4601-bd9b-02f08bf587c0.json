Sunderland\u2019s 3-0 win against Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s struggling Everton was sufficient to end survival hopes on Tyneside and in Norfolk. Although Alex Neil\u2019s side defeated Watford 4-2 at Carrow Road it was not enough to save his team, who go down with Aston Villa and Newcastle. While Rafael Ben\u00edtez will agonise over whether he wants to continue managing the latter during second-tier trips to Burton Albion and the like next season, Lee Charnley issued a statement thanking Newcastle fans for their support and apologising for relegation. \u201cI am truly sorry we have not given you the outcome you deserve,\u201d the club\u2019s managing director said. \u201cWe are devastated.\u201d While Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, ponders how his board spent \u00a380m on players this season and still missed out on the \u00a3100m Premier League television deal for next season, Allardyce promised to break Sunderland\u2019s cycle of repeated relegations struggles. It was their fourth consecutive successful battle against dropping into the Championship but there were times when Allardyce believed it was a struggle they might not win. \u201cTo be safe with one game to go is pretty miraculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no way I wanted to go to Watford on Sunday with anything on the line but you go back into November when Everton beat us 6-2 and it shows how far we\u2019ve come. We turned into a team from January onwards. This is probably one of my greatest achievements in management.\u201d He confirmed he would still be at the Stadium of Light next season. \u201cAm I staying? I hope so but the next set of recruitment is crucial. This club can\u2019t be cheering and doing a lap of honour every season just for escaping relegation.\u201d As he sipped a glass of beer, Allardyce revealed he had used as motivation his predecessor Dick Advocaat\u2019s claim that Sunderland were doomed to relegation. \u201cWhat was sweet was proving Dick wrong. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect for Dick Advocaat but I used that as motivation for the players.\u201d Asked if relegating Newcastle and his old sparring partner Ben\u00edtez was satisfying, he said: \u201cNot really, no. It\u2019s not Rafa\u2019s fault, he\u2019s made a valiant effort, he\u2019s not lost in five games now \u2013 but we\u2019ve lost only once in 10.\u201d Relief was Allardyce\u2019s overwhelming emotion. \u201cThis is the worst season we could have got relegated from the Premier League. We\u2019ve secured massive revenue and there\u2019s great relief there\u2019s going to be no staff cutbacks.\u201d Referring to major problems when he arrived in October, Allardyce suggested the imprisonment of Adam Johnson on child-sex offences had taken its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s been a testing time on and off the field. There have been more difficulties, more challenges than I\u2019ve faced before, but we\u2019ve come through it.\u201d Spending \u00a315m on Jan Kirchhoff, Lamine Kon\u00e9, who scored twice against Everton, and Wahbi Khazri in January changed everything. \u201cThe only way we could survive was going into the market. It\u2019s proven to be the case. Since the dark days of December when we lost five in a row we\u2019ve got stronger and stronger.\u201d In contrast to his spells at Newcastle and West Ham, the 61-year-old Allardyce benefits from an adoring public on Wearside. \u201cThe appreciation from the crowd at the end was wonderful. It was a wonderful feeling for me. We\u2019re in the game to be appreciated and you\u2019re working for the supporters. Your responsibility is to entertain and satisfy them. I\u2019ve got great admiration for the patience Sunderland fans have shown at a time when society has never been less patient.\u201d Roberto Mart\u00ednez faces dismissal at Everton but claimed his players are \u201c100%\u201d behind him. \u201cSunderland are very efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough to take. I though we stayed in the game really well. I one hundred percent believe the players are behind me and fighting for me. The players gave everything. The difference was in the box but it wasn\u2019t that big.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
