Nigel Worthington may have been similarly misunderstood after this game when he apparently called Sheffield United \"ordinary\". What the Norwich manager must have said was \"thorny\". Or perhaps \"contradictory\". Or, even more accurately, \"extraordinary\". The battlers of Bramall Lane were at it again on Saturday, doing brilliantly what they are meant to be poor at, doing poorly what they are meant to good at, mixing knockabout farce with the odd sublime moment, pulling off one of the surprises of the season. Then Neil Warnock, a man regarded with alarm or distaste by most of his fellow managers, entertained reporters with comments that were by turns outspoken, exaggerated, frank and inconsistent. The surprises started in the second minute. Norwich had not previously conceded a goal at home or in the first half. United took 76 seconds to ruin those records, when Michael Brown sent his free-kick on the classic curling path, over the wall and into the corner. Within half an hour, United, using a defensive-looking line-up and the same strikers who misfired so badly in the Sheffield derby, went 3-0 up. They then had Iffy Onuora sent off but held out without discomfort until the last 10 minutes, when they gave up two goals from corners and needed Patrick Kenny to make two point-blank saves, one of them, from Iwan Roberts's viciously struck volley, requiring such agility, courage and anticipation that you suspected him of being capable of catching bullets in his teeth. Phil Dowd also got in on the act, riling Norwich with a series of questionable calls and banishing Worthington to the stands - for miming, the Norwich manager said. But then some of Worthington's decisions were also questionable. At 3-0 down and up against 10 men, he kept his back four intact and neglected to bring on Darel Russell until the 93rd minute. A supporter described this strategy as \"Norfolk in use\", but I could have misheard.
