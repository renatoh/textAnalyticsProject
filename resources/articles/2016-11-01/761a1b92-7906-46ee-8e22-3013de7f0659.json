In the Financial Times a week ago the paper\u2019s chief United States columnist Edward Luce wrote about \u201cThe age of vitriol\u201d and observed that democracy\u2019s sense of restraint seems to have vanished. \u201cThe glue of mutual respect that is so vital to any free society came unstuck.\u201d Anne Applebaum, a Warsaw-based columnist with the Washington Post, spoke of the spread of the \u201cPopulist International\u201d, not only with Trump in the US, but in European countries and with Ukip in the UK. While the language may differ from place to place, the common thread of this movement is the expulsion of immigrants, a return to white dominance and the reversal of women\u2019s or minorities\u2019 rights. Yet regressive voices in Australian politics and media see this as the occasion to water down our race discrimination laws, if not junk them entirely. The timing could not be more exquisite. In fact, section 18C, the most discussed provision in the entire assembly of consolidated commonwealth law, actually should be strengthened and, along with it, the get-out-of jail defence in 18D. It might be thought that if people were really interested in freedom of speech then why aren\u2019t they mightily upset with section 31 of the \u201cuniform\u201d Defamation Act which deals with the defence of honest opinion and is so bound in technicalities and abstractions that it rarely, if ever, works for people wanting to defend an opinion in court. There\u2019s never a squeak about section 31 from the self-appointed protectors of free speech. Nor is anything said about the barrowloads of other laws that inhibit citizens from protesting, that undermine the principle of open courts and open justice, that prevent access to government information, and hide the truth about the welfare of people jailed in offshore detention centres. It is utterly delusional to suggest that speech will be \u201cfreerer\u201d in Australia once 18C has been sliced and diced. The tirade about 18C is a massive piece of fakery, a culture war conceit. The proponents of change are not really interested in the wider horizons of free speech, other than loosening inhibitions on bigotry and racial nastiness. Nor is the attorney general, George Brandis, much of a free speech man. He has confined the inquiry by a parliamentary committee to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act, as though they alone are responsible for blots on our freedoms. The bigger problems with free speech are nowhere to be found in his terms of reference. This is no surprise when you remember the way in 2013 Brandis extolled the champions of free speech in Australia: \u201cWho defends freedom of speech in Australia today? Is it really to be left to a few conservative commentators like Andrew Bolt and Janet Albrechtsen; a couple of thinktanks like the Sydney Institute and the IPA and the Liberal party?\u201d The unifying feature of the 18C free speech brigade is that they don\u2019t actually believe in human rights at all \u2013 certainly not in a formalised regime of a Human Rights Act or Charter of Rights. That is out of the question \u2013 again, for idealogical reasons. To demand to be unshackled from 18C while opposing a regime of contestable human rights shows how lopsided, bizarre and dishonest this issue has become. It doesn\u2019t get much more dotty than senator David Leyonhjelm saying he will support the government\u2019s industrial relations legislation if it repeals the prohibitions on race speech. Let\u2019s keep to the two things Brandis has sent to the parliamentary committee: the RDA and the AHRC Act. The shred-18C lobby has the curious belief that the relevant provisions can be sliced into separate parts: offend, insult, humiliate and intimidate. The idea is that if you get rid of the first two on the list then humiliate and intimidate might be barely tolerable. Even the Human Rights Commission president, Gillian Triggs, has fallen for it, saying she is open to the idea of replacing \u201coffend and insult\u201d with \u201cvilify\u201d. On the other hand the judges, in the rare number of 18C cases that ever get to court, do not look at offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate as separate components to be applied individually to the circumstances of the alleged offence. The words are applied collectively, as a omnibus concept. This is evident in Eatock v Bolt when Justice Bromberg used the word \u201coffend\u201d as \u201cshorthand\u201d for offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate. Professor David Rolph from Sydney law school points out the removal of \u201coffend and insult\u201d from the law \u201cmay not have a substantial impact on those who have been found liable for contravening 18C\u201d \u2013 including Andrew Bolt in the Eatock case. Triggs has also said she wants the Human Rights Commission to be able to knock out worthless complaints much earlier in the process: \u201cWe would welcome an attempt to moderate our statute that would make it a little easier for the commission to say these matters are coming to us and we don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got any legs at all. We\u2019ve long argued for this.\u201d This is puzzling, because she has long had that very authority. The Australian Human Rights Commission Act gives the president the power to terminate a complaint on a wide range of grounds, including that the alleged discrimination is not unlawful or that the complaint is trivial, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance. There exists plenty of precedent to enable decisions to be made relatively quickly as to the whether discrimination is lawful or not. Of course, if people who allege discrimination are unhappy about having their complaints terminated by the president, they can still go to the federal court or the federal circuit court \u2013 but by then the matter is out of the hands of the commission. It\u2019s not that the Human Rights Commission requires more power \u2013 the law as it stands just needs to be appropriately applied. To have said what she did, it might be assumed that Triggs had been poleaxed by too much bullying from the media and politicians. What does need close attention is section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act \u2013 the defence to what otherwise would be offences under 18C. The context here are performances, exhibitions or artistic works or discussion and debate for academic, artistic or scientific purposes. For the media the defence extends to fair and accurate reporting of any matter of public interest or \u201ca fair comment on any event or matter of public interest ... \u201d Professor Rolph points out there are problems with 18D, not least of which is that it imports the ineffective fair comment element from defamation law, thereby creating difficulties for media defendants in 18C cases. If only these swivel-eyed campaigners would recognise that it is 18D that needs fixing, not 18C, then the mental health of the entire nation would be a lot better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
