However, a more worrying point, which he might have addressed, is the way in which \u2013 no doubt due to the same processes that lead to the introduction of such terms \u2013 single words or phrases come to dominate language, killing off any opposition, and ultimately impoverishing it; to the extent that, for instance, many people nowadays seem to have only a single superlative at their disposal, resulting in such things as a poster that hangs in my GP\u2019s surgery, asking: \u201cHave you had great care today?\u201d Jim Grozier Brighton, East Sussex \u2022 Anyone who feels upset by the overuse of \u201clike\u201d might turn to the American poet AE Stallings, who takes it for the title of her 2018 collection. She includes a virtuoso sestina which \u201crhymes\u201d the word 39 times, and the following passage: \u201cThose poets who dislike / Inversions, archaisms, who just like / Plain English as she\u2019s spoke \u2013 why isn\u2019t \u2018like\u2019 / Their (literally) every other word? I\u2019d like / Us just to admit that\u2019s what real speech is like.\u201d John Greening Stonely, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Pretending to watch Love Island for linguistic analysis is so Guardian. John Vaughan York \u2022 I\u2019ve just listened to an interesting segment on Radio 4\u2019s You and Yours. The interviewee spoke of the lack of dental care services in care homes but irritated me by summing up the report as having a number of \u201casks\u201d for the relevant commission to consider \u2013 for example, \u201cOur first ask is for\u2026\u201d. What is wrong with \u201crequest\u201d?
