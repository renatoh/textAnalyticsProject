Overall Osborne seems to have learnt from the mistakes of the budget earlier this year when he tried to disguise some of the small but nasty tax rises, only to be rumbled. But if Britain is indeed in a global race, Osborne was forced to admit it is drifting near the back of the pack, and gathering speed at the most anaemic rate. His chief argument is that the other side would run even more slowly than him, and if you just keep faith in the government strategy, he will eventually be able to get out of the slow lane. \"It is a hard road, but we are getting there,\" Osborne said. Labour laughed, but will the public? After three years of austerity, Osborne is only able to promise five more years. In the full year before the election, 2014, growth may crawl up to 2%, inflation will be 2.2%, real disposable income only just in the black and unemployment at 8.2%. It is not an auspicious springboard to enter an election. The test will be deeply personal, a question of whether the public trusts Osborne, and accepts that the blame lies with world events largely beyond his control \u2013 the analysis endorsed by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But the election will also be a choice and every Tory spokesman hammered home the apparent illogicality of the Labour message: \"The deficit is not coming down fast enough \u2013 therefore we should borrow more.\" At some point Labour is going to have to say whether it accepts the coalition spending plans, and specifically early next year whether it will vote for the proposed welfare cuts. Labour can rightly point out that the bulk of the welfare cuts will not fall on some stereotype of a scrounger, lying around behind drawn curtains, but on working people. Indeed 60% of the welfare squeeze will fall on working people, according to the Resolution Foundation. Yet saying cuts are painful, or not very \"one nation\" is hardly a political credo. Voters will demand more than platitudes about predistribution from Labour. Asked if Labour will vote against the welfare squeeze, shadow chancellor Ed Balls replied: \"We are not going to make any commitments at all on tax and spending decisions ahead of our manifesto.\" Austerity's longer timescale also presents a huge political problem for the Conservative's coalition partners. For a brief moment on Wednesday the Liberal Democrats seemed to be on the verge of striking a daringly independent note. Clegg, sitting next to Osborne on the front bench, pointedly disagreed when the chancellor \u2013 forced by the prime minister \u2013 ruled out a mansion tax. Within minutes of Osborne sitting down, the Lib Dems were pinging out a message to journalists to the effect that it was their sole doing that personal tax allowance was rising again. That message included the audacious claim that the only tax cuts the Conservatives are interested in are for the rich, a claim rebuffed by Osborne's political adviser Rupert Harrison, saying the chancellor's personal priorities had been lifting the personal allowance and ending the road fuel escalator. Yet when the Lib Dems held their briefing they disowned the message sent out by party headquarters as incorrect, a mistake and out of date. \"Osborne had embraced the Liberal Democrats' flagship policy on personal allowances,\" their spokesman said. Overall, the Lib Dems hailed the autumn statement for taking 2.2 million people out of tax altogether, and giving 20 million basic rate taxpayers a \u00a3600 tax cut from April next year through higher personal allowances. Asked why Clegg had accepted a three-year benefits squeeze, the spokesman explained: \"We have always accepted that when we need to tighten our belts, the welfare budget could not be immune from savings, and we believe these decisions have been taken in the fairest way possible.\" The party claimed the pain had been distributed evenly. The cumulative cost over the forecast period of the welfare cuts was \u00a313.7bn and the receipts from the rich, including capital gains tax, pensions and tax avoidance amounts to \u00a316.1bn. The Lib Dems said the party's red lines had been protected \u2013 stopping a \u00a310bn cut in welfare, including a planned freeze on benefits, and securing a larger contribution by the wealthiest through the pensions tax relief. They also declared a victory: \"The case for regional pay has been looked at, it has been lost and the issue is now closed\". Yet the Lib Dems have embraced a three-year squeeze on benefits, probably deeper in impact than a one-year freeze. Osborne defended the decision, saying: \"Out-of-work benefits have increased by 20% over the last five years, while average earnings in the public and private sectors have gone up by 10%.\" The decision is already causing discontent amongst Liberal Democrat activists. Osborne has also presented the Lib Dems with a bigger problem. He announced that by next summer, he will be holding a cross departmental spending review for the year 2015-16 which will have to identify another \u00a310bn in cuts \u2013 including, according to the Conservatives, another tranche of welfare cuts. Those cuts will cover the first year after the election, binding the Lib Dems and Tories into a joint programme for the start of the parliament. They have also agreed the pace of deficit reduction up to 2017-18. Maintaining political equidistance between Labour and the Conservatives at the next election in these circumstances will \u2013 at least presentationally \u2013 be more difficult. But the bigger worry for Liberal Democrat figures like the business secretary Vince Cable, incidentally a departmental budget winner yesterday, is whether the macro measures do enough to stimulate demand directly enough to lift growth. The autumn statement is after all fiscally neutral and, apart from the \u00a35bn switch to capital spending, does little direct to boost growth. The OBR estimates that the policy announcements in the statement will provide a very modest boost to economic growth in 2013 and 2014 (0.1 percentage point per annum in each year), less than the OBR's estimate of the boost to the economy from its earlier Funding for Lending Scheme. The chief growth measures are an uneasy intellectual blend between Heseltinian intervention, cuts in corporation tax, deregulation and quantitative easing. For the moment, at least, the deal looks enough to keep the privately uneasy social democratic wing of the Liberal Democrats on board. After nearly three years, and so much pain, they may feel they have no option but to stay on Osborne's hard road."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
