You've ripped the St George's flag from your car window and vowed never to sing 'Three Lions' ever again. You've watched dumbfounded as lowly Greece achieved what mighty England couldn't - qualifying for the semi-finals. And now you're angry... really angry. But who's to blame for your misery? \"The players,\" says Balbinder, furiously. \"They are all experienced professionals and 90% of them play regularly in the Champions League. \"Surely they don't need Sven to wipe their backsides all the time. \"They should be able to read a match situation for themselves and act accordingly. \"Or are the England players all just a little bit thick?\" Well, they're no scholars. But what about the torn-up penalty spot, eh? Surely that sand-blasted piece of turf must take some of the blame? \"No way,\" says Tim Gladwin: \"The England penalty takers looked like a bunch of supporters looking to win prizes in a half-time penalty competition. \"Their technique was simply awful. It was entirely apparent that Beckham's kick was going high into the stand even before the condition of the penalty spot could have any effect.\" And even David James has been copping the flak despite being helpless with the fatal Portuguese spot-kicks. \"David James' fear of dominating his penalty box and his unwillingness to intercept over-hit throughballs deprived his back four of the reassurance they craved throughout the whole tournament,\" says Tim. \"I found myself wishing that David Seaman's organisational skills were still to be found between the sticks. Oh for a goalkeeper worthy of the international jersey!\" And Michael Grayeff won't even allow anyone to blame tiredness for England's downfall - (there goes David Beckham's excuse). \"The real problem is that too many of the players are selected for their heart, passion and will,\" he says. \"And when this proves insufficient, there is no alternative game-plan and no skilled player who can create an opening by any other means than just lung-busting. \"Tiredness comes as a result of giving away possession - it is an effect, not a cause.\" And Michael claims his theory of 'the relative merits of team-spirit' can be explained by 'simple Mathematics': \"Spirit in the camp is necessary but not sufficient.\" We'll take you word for that Michael. Timothy Fox attempted to comfort all England fans by suggesting that they should: \"Get a life and learn how to play the game.\" Enough said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
