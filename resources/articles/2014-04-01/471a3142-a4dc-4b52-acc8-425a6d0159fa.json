Where the loose, mumblecore-ish druggie farce Crystal Fairy\u2026 was enjoyably scabrous, its companion piece Magic Magic, again starring Michael Cera, is a shapeless mess. Juno Temple (always watchable, often weird \u2013 and she's certainly both here) plays fragile Alicia, travelling outside the US for the first time, and lapsing into disturbed panic when she falls among less than sympathetic travelling companions on a Chilean island. Silva drums up a vague mood of hovering balefulness but the result is neither effective psycho-horror nor a full-blooded indie improv exercise. But the cast, including the director's brother, Agust\u00edn Silva, is good, and as a sneery narcissist, the usually likable Cera shows he can also be memorably repellent. He's a long way from the frozen bananas of Arrested Development."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
