The diary seems to recall at least two big productions not that long ago, both saying that colleges are clogged with too much bumf. So why has the Cabinet Office now barged in on the act with a real insomnia-busting number entitled \"Reducing Burdens in Colleges of Further Education\"? The accompanying press release begins: \"Lecturers and tutors in further education will spend more time teaching and less time form-filling under new proposals to cut the amount of bureaucracy.\" One weary principal comments: \"If we didn't have so many bloody bureaucracy reports to wade through maybe we would have time to get some work done.\" \u00b7 The Olympic spirit doesn't apply when we are battling the French. There is glee in and around Skills UK, the organisation spearheading our bid for the biennial WorldSkills contest to come to the capital in 2011, because France is one of the three other countries bidding. It was the French who got most hissy when London was picked to host the 2012 Olympic games. The French aren't even bidding for the skills Olympics to come to Paris, but to Nantes, which means, apparently, that they have nulle chance of clinching it. Of the other two bidders, Sweden is reckoned not to have a prayer because this year's contest was in Helsinki, and the event seemingly can't return to Scandinavia so soon. Which leaves Australia, and Melbourne, as London's only serious rival. \u00b7 Skills minister Phil Hope is an ace juggler who has progressed way beyond the three-beanbag stage. Alas, our hopes that he could form a cabaret act at the Association of Colleges conference dinner with his Tory oppo, Stephen O'Brien, - a pianist good enough to have been offered a scholarship to the Paris Conservatoire at 16 - were scuppered when O'Brien was moved in a reshuffle on Friday. John Hayes, the new Tory spokesman for vocational education, enjoys painting and poetry, but we don't yet know if he has any party turns. \u00b7 It must be an office party prank by a pissed civil servant. A recruitment ad from the Department for Work and Pensions is seeking a \"head of leadership and talent\". This outlandish position - salary \u00a375,000 plus pension - will not have a role, as such. But, says the ad, its \"accountabilities\" will be to \"define and deliver the overarching skills strategy for the largest government department\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
