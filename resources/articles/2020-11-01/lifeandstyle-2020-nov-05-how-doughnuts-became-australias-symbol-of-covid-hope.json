On 26 October one photo of an empty Woolworths shelf in Melbourne, cleared of that day\u2019s doughnuts, sparked hope. \u201cEveryone in Melbourne\u2019s had the same idea! Sold out donuts!\u201d Sally Rugg, author and executive director of change.org, tweeted to her 46,000 followers. Just hours after Victoria\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services announced the state\u2019s first day of zero new cases and zero deaths since early June, locked-down residents started celebrating the end of the second wave of Covid-19 infections with doughnuts, posting photos and emojis on social media with the hashtag #donutday. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, declared it a \u201cgood day\u201d and posed with a classic glazed, while the state\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton (who has replaced the \u201cO\u201d in his Twitter username with a doughnut emoji) was welcomed home from work with a mixed box. Six consecutive days of no new cases in Victoria, and Saturday marking Australia\u2019s first day without locally acquired cases since 9 June, have seen the hashtag boom, with doughnut shops feeling the reverberations. \u201cDoughnuts make people happy \u2013 I couldn\u2019t imagine a better way to celebrate,\u201d says Anthony Ivey, co-owner of Shortstop Coffee and Donuts in Melbourne\u2019s city centre. Since restrictions lifted, Shortstop\u2019s sales have doubled, and they\u2019ve sold out just after lunch on every double-zero (no new cases, no new deaths) day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to be a thing but one of our regular customers said he was waiting until the first \u2018donut day\u2019 to have his first doughnut after lockdown,\u201d Ivey says. The unexpected trend caught purveyors off-guard, with some upping output and others jumping on the news to promote deals and giveaways. \u201cThe first four or five zero days [production] was significantly higher,\u201d says Raph Rashid, owner of All Day Donuts in Brunswick. \u201cWe were making double or triple what we normally do.\u201d Although Rugg was an early trend adopter of the hashtags #donutday and #putoutyourdonuts \u2013 reminiscent of the #putoutyourpotatoes trend after Peter Dutton lost the leadership spill in 2018 \u2013 she says she had already seen the term on Twitter that morning. Of course #donutday has been tagged many times before, for National Donut Day in the US, first celebrated in 1938 to honour the Salvation Army \u201cDoughnut Lassies\u201d \u2013 women who served doughnuts and coffee to frontline troops during the first world war. But in Australia, doughnuts have symbolised Covid hope since 20 April, when Anthony Macali, data and reporting analyst and founder of Covid Live, tweeted a doughnut emoji in commendation of South Australia\u2019s third day of zero new cases. Since then, Macali has created graphics with sprinkled sweets in place of zeros, and used doughnut emojis on Twitter as shorthand for \u201cno new cases today\u201d. Covid Australia, another data account, credits him with starting the trend. \u201cUsually waiting for Covid numbers each time is tense and anxious, so I thought doughnuts might be a fun \u2026 way to celebrate achievements,\u201d Macali tells Guardian Australia, saying he got the idea from tennis, where a \u201cbagel\u201d or a \u201cdoughnut\u201d is slang for a set that ends 6-0. Although one Twitter user suggested \u201clove day\u201d as another tennis-themed alternative, fried food won. \u201cI never thought it would extend past our initial zero-case day but here we are,\u201d Macali says. \u201c[Doughnuts are] a way to treat ourselves during this lockdown [but] I think any treat is valid, it doesn\u2019t have to be a doughnut.\u201d Melbourne\u2019s doughnut connoisseurs have welcomed the silliness and optimism of it all, feeling connected through small indulgences. And, after spending more than half of 2020 in lockdown, Rashid says Melburnians just needed something lighter to focus on \u2013 \u201canything just to break it up\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
