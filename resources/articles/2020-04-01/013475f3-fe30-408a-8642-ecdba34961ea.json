I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence; where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate their long memories; and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms. But because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes. Instead of meeting his clever plants, I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball-like pods from an aquatic species, on the bookshelves behind him. \u201cThey\u2019re used for propagation,\u201d he says. \u201cI am always collecting seeds.\u201d Before Mancuso\u2019s lab started work in 2005, plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept. \u201cWe were interested in problems that were, until that moment, just related to animals, like intelligence and even behaviour,\u201d he says. At the time, it was \u201calmost forbidden\u201d to talk about behaviour in plants. But \u201cwe study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that\u201d. Mancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants, just like neuroscientists train lab rats. If you let a drop of water fall on a Mimosa pudica, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. \u201cThat was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days \u2013 the average memory of insects,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cTo find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.\u201d Not least because they don\u2019t have brains. In a plant, a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch. \u201cPlants use a very different strategy,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cThey are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body.\u201d You can remove 90% of a plant without killing it. \u201cYou need to imagine a plant as a huge brain. Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals, but diffused everywhere.\u201d One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso\u2019s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate. \u201cLet\u2019s use another term,\u201d Mancuso suggests. \u201cConsciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let\u2019s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.\u201d A simple example is when one plant overshadows another \u2013 the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. \u201cSo they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,\u201d says Mancuso. Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. \u201cVery few animals are able to do this,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cHumans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.\u201d Mancuso believes this is wrong. \u201cMy personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it\u2019s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.\u201d Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state \u2013 incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. \u201cAnd this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.\u201d There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas \u201cplants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil\u201d, he says. Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars. Plants respond to sound, too, \u201cfeeling\u201d vibrations all over. \u201cPlants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz \u2026 because they are seeking the sound of running water.\u201d If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it. Another reason we overlook plants\u2019 intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso\u2019s new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world\u2019s oldest plant \u2013 Old Tjikko \u2013 a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect \u2013 and can survive for six years while waiting. The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of \u201cnative species\u201d and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. \u201cThe more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,\u201d he says. \u201cInvasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.\u201d For Mancuso, \u201cmigration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.\u201d Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal Trends in Plant Science that Mancuso and his colleagues \u201chave consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge\u201d. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. \u201cIt\u2019s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.\u201d The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: \u201cWhen you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.\u201d The average lifespan of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. \u201cHomo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,\u201d he says \u2013 and already \u201cwe have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?\u201d Perhaps we should try \u2013 ahem \u2013 taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom\u2019s book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies \u2013 with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. \u201cWe use this in our universities, our companies, even our class divisions,\u201d says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole. Plants, by contrast, \u201care kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity\u201d. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. \u201cLook at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I\u2019m claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,\u201d Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, \u201care masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.\u201d We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ.
