The England defender is understood to have suffered ligament damage to his left knee. In September 1999 he injured the cruciate ligaments in his right knee and missed much of the season. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, confirmed yesterday that Brown had injured himself in training. He did not reveal any details but claimed the player might still be fit for tonight's Champions League tie at home to Boavista. However, there were reports last night, unconfirmed by the club, that Brown is facing a lengthy lay-off that could have serious repercussions for club and country. Ferguson has already lost Ronny Johnsen until the new year because of a knee injury and Brown's loss would be a damaging blow to what is an increasingly turbulent season. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
