It's on the new airline schedules from the end of October - a medina, souks and mild winter climate just over three hours away. Getting there: GB Airways from Heathrow (ba.com), or Ryanair (ryanair.com) from Luton. Where to stay: Riad Maison Bleue (maisonbleue.com): 13 cool tiled rooms around a courtyard with pool. Two nights' B&amp;B from \u00a3435pp including flights through Best of Morocco (0845 0264588, realmorocco.com). Where to eat: La Maison Bleue, sister hotel of Riad Maison Bleue, for jaouhara, a poppadom-like pudding drenched in icing. Or stalls inside the medina. What to buy: As much as you can carry: blue and white Fassi pottery from Naji Art Fekhari, Ain Noqbi; kaftans and djellabas from L'Art de Kaftan Fassi, 23 Zniqte Hajjama; loads of good stuff in the medina."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
