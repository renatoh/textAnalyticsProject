One or two must have been travelling along totally different roads! Probably the main difference is whether you're a passenger or a driver. As a driver you have to maintain more than your usual share of concentration, and while negotiating hairpin bends, you won't have much opportunity to enjoy the spectacular views. Apart from crumbling edges - especially dodgy when squeezing past oncoming vehicles - there are the odd goats or camels to pass, so great care must be taken, with very low speeds at all times. I would say, do it if you're experienced at driving along narrow mountain roads, if not, leave it. Accidents there can be horrendous, and the hospitals are not too great; no view on earth is worth that risk. Ann Eastman \u0095 We drove through the Tiz'n'Test pass in the Atlas Mountains last Easter. It was a steep mountainous drive with no barriers on the side, but if you take it carefully, the spectacular views are well worth the journey. We rented a gutless Fiat Uno, which survived remarkably well. There was only one hairy incident where we had to pass a bus that had one wheel clearly hanging over the edge. This didn't appear to faze the driver or the passengers at all. Linda See \u0095 It's seven or eight years since I drove over this pass from south to north. It is a metalled road all the way and unless it has deteriorated badly since then should present no problems to a standard car. We crossed in early April, earlier in the year than this, in line with other Moroccan mountain roads, there is always the chance of sections washed out by snow melt not being repaired. From late March/early April onwards there should be no problem. It is quite a major route for local commercial traffic so I don't think it likely that it has deteriorated. If you have any concerns you could make enquiries with the tourist police in Marrakech who are always very helpful. If you have problems with French, most would have sufficient English for a straightforward request for information about roads. Dick Scroop \u0095 I travelled the pass by bus last summer coming from Taroudannt. Finding a bus wasn't easy and I had the paranoid impression that people thought I must be mad! Children are not allowed on the bus due to altitude sickness; it is narrow and the danger, as always, comes in the form of other drivers. You're rewarded with a spectacular journey: looking down on circling eagles, and beautiful landscapes (punctuated with the occasional wrecks of poor souls who didn't make it!). Philip Butler \u0095 Tizzy-making and Testing, this pass in the High Atlas is certainly passable - and best left behind. Last May, during a holiday in Taroudannt, we hired a car with a driver for a day trip up into the mountains. We made it to the fine, restored mosque at Tin-Mal, which just about justified the terrifying nature of the trip. The pass is no more than a narrow track cut into the steep, steep mountain sides. The road itself is barely wider than the antique Mercedes we travelled in, has no parapet to stop you going over the edge and down half-a-mile or so. Worse, there are blind hairpins and corners by the hundred. Most are so sharp that a vehicle is reduced to a walking pace - and you still find yourself praying that an oncoming driver is as frightened as you are. . . Needless to say, the views are spectacular, our driver was a gent, and we had a great lunch in a cafe built out over a sheer drop. But I wouldn't dream of driving it myself, and won't rush to repeat the experience. Bevan Jones \u0095 I was driven over the Tiz'n'Test pass in April last year, when there was snow on the peaks. The pass itself is not too bad, but the approach from Marrakech is terrifying, especially if something is coming in the opposite direction. A weather check is advisable before setting off. It's not that dangerous, though. My parents have done it twice. Felicia Hughes-Freeland \u0095 Yes, it is passable and is well worth the effort for the views the road affords. We travelled along it about three years ago taking a taxi from Taroudannt to Marrakech. The taxi driver didn't want to take the road and tried to put us off, but we found a bit more money persuaded him. The road itself is amazing and an engineering feat. At the top we had tea in a small cafe that also offered accommodation. Unfortunately the clouds didn't break for us to see the view from the top, but the winding road downwards towards Marrakech held awesome views of the Atlas mountains. Although winding and narrow it is as safe a road as the Moroccan highroads and was definitely one of the major points of our holiday. Claire Moloney \u0095 My boyfriend and I drove over Tiz' n' Test last March. Although it is slow going, it is perfectly passable, even in a Fiat Uno. It is also well worth the effort, with beautiful views on both sides. However, the views from the pass towards Taroudannt are often obscured by cloud, especially in the afternoon, and snow does block the pass during the winter months. Helen Sandwell, London \u0095 We were driven over Tiz'n'Test in a Mercedes taxi in February from Taroudannt to Marrakesh. It was exhilarating but not dangerous - there is room for cars to pass at most places. It's worth having a driver who knows the route - the only hazardous moments were when we met hire-cars driven by Europeans. It also means you can enjoy the stunning scenery. Good value too - the whole day out cost 1600 Dirhams (about \u00a3107) for four people. Bob Rhodes \u0095 My husband and I travelled from Taroudannt over the Tiz'n'Test pass in the High Atlas last year. We hired a taxi for the day and the driver took us all the way through the mountains to the Tinmal mosque. The trip was breathtakingly beautiful and the road, though very winding and narrow in parts, was perfectly passable. At no point did we feel ourselves to be in danger - in fact we have experienced far more dangerous conditions in southern Spain and on certain roads in England! I would heartily recommend the journey. Helen Hartstein \u0095 We drove over the pass in a local bus mid January this year and the road was fine. We travelled from Marrakech to Taroudannt and saw many ordinary cars on the road. The road does however need to be driven with some caution as there are also a fair amount of trucks on some very narrow sections. The road does shut after heavy snow falls so check the local weather conditions. It is however a very impressive view from the top of the pass. Simon James \u0095 We drove over this pass in January this year. There was no snow so that was not an issue. However, the road, although perfectly OK in terms of tarmac, is rather narrow and the drop on one side, of course, is pretty dramatic. There is also a lot of gravel on the edge of the road. The biggest problem is the continual hairpin bends around the mountains so, whoever is driving, unless a very experienced driver in this sort of terrain, will not be able to appreciate the scenery as they will need to concentrate continually. I would, however, recommend the 'Berber omelette' served at the cafe immediately prior to the Pass coming up from Taroudannt! Karen Wilkin \u0095 Don't be put off by the guide books or you will miss some amazing scenery and - possibly - 'people experiences', depending on where you stop and who you meet as you pass through the villages en route. The views alone are worth the effort, and the Berber villages on the Marrakesh side are stunning. We crossed the pass as it was snowing, just before Christmas 2000, in a hired Fiat Uno. Although the road is narrow in parts, it is perfectly negotiable even in such bad conditions. The alternative routes are significantly less attractive and interesting.
