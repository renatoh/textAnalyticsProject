In fact, he was \u2013 albeit provocatively \u2013 fulfilling his duty to provide the facts about controlled pharmaceuticals. Today he warns that moral panic about particular pills is hampering important research into the application of psychedelics to psychiatry. Of course, drugs can cause great harm, but our inability to retain perspective on how much damage happens how often reflects a wider failing to reckon rationally with risk. The terror laws watchdog, David Anderson, has relayed that wasps and bees have killed as many Britons as al-Qaida over the last decade. But no insect invites the same horror, and so none has led us to trash ancient liberties. Independent advisers on risk do a great service; inconvenient truths are the sting in their tail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
