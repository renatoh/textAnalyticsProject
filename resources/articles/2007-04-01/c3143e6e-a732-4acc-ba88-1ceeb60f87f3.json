McManus still has six entries among the 68 horses declared yesterday for the Aintree version this weekend, a race he has yet to win, and L'Ami, the likely mount of Tony McCoy, could be close to favouritism by Saturday if his many followers decide to reinvest yesterday's winnings. It was a brave and remarkable performance by Butler's Cabin, who collapsed from exhaustion just moments after his victory in the National Hunt Chase at the Cheltenham Festival last month. There was no hint that the experience had left a mark, though, as he cruised along in the pack through the first circuit as Church Island and Dix Villez cut out the running. When McCoy made his move on the run to the third-last, it was as if Butler's Cabin had only recently joined in and, while his jockey was careful to leave his final effort until after the last, he did not need to be at his most foreceful to hold Nine De Savola by a length. Butler's Cabin again failed to reach the winner's enclosure yesterday, but Jonjo O'Neill, his trainer, confirmed that all was well with the seven-year-old. \"That happens to him all the time as he gets a bit excited,\" O'Neill said. \"He's a great jumper and he had a great spin round. He's in the Betfred [Gold Cup at Sandown] but I imagine it would be next year before you see him again. All being well, we'll look forward to Aintree.\" McCoy was recording his first success in the Irish Grand National and only his second in one of the major Nationals, 10 years after he took the Scottish equivalent on Belmont King. \"We got a good clear run and he was always travelling well, which you need in a handicap like this,\" the jockey said. \"I won on him over two and a half miles at Cheltenham in the autumn and he showed plenty of speed, and then he won over four miles at Cheltenham, which showed he stayed. Any horse that can win over four at Cheltenham and then win an Irish National is obviously very special.\" Both McCoy and McManus will now turn their attention to Aintree, where L'Ami is set to carry 11st 8lb, just 4lb less than the topweight, Hedgehunter. The names to come out yesterday included State Of Play and Forget The Past. After 13 withdrawals, it seems likely that Joes Edge, who took the William Hill Handicap Chase at the Cheltenham Festival, will get a run on Saturday. Ferdy Murphy's 10-year-old needs just two more withdrawals to get into the field and has joined Dun Doire and Point Barrow as a 10-1 co-favourite for the race with Coral. They then offer 11-1 about Numbersixvalverde, last year's winner, and it is 14-1 bar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
