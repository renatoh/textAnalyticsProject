In a heavily critical letter published in today's Evening Standard, De Jongh condemns Platell's column on the MP as \"a piece of gutter-press journalism - her second on a gay theme\" within weeks. And he accuses her of exemplifying \"the sort of gay hatred and mockery\" that has forced gay men to resort to the internet. Platell, who writes a weekly column for the Standard, last week criticised Mr Bryant for \"parading his wares, literally, on a website promoting unprotected sex,\" after a Sunday newspaper published details of the advert he had placed on the site. Describing herself as \"open-minded\" and insisting that \"some of my best friends are gay,\" Platell said she had nevertheless been \"repulsed\" by the images on the Gaydar web site, where Mr Bryant's advert appeared. \"The images I saw on the website were repulsive, and that's the problem for Bryant - this kind of behaviour repulses even open-minded people like me. It also damages his credibility as a gay rights campaigner,\" she wrote. But her comments infuriated De Jongh, who said Platell's opinion was based on \"malevolent untruths\" and that the article was likely to alienate gay readers of the newspaper. \"In my 12 years at the Evening Standard I have never been so upset or angered by an article as Amanda Platell's attempt to incite contempt for the unfortunate Chris Bryant,\" he wrote. \"I went into the Gaydar system after reading her piece to test its accuracy. The website, I soon discovered, doesn't 'promote unprotected sex' as she alleges, nor is it a procurement centre.\" De Jongh credited the Standard's editor, Veronica Wadley, for the paper's \"valuable, positive, insightful features about gay life\" adding: \"No other Standard editor would have promoted my piece on the gay Mardi Gras.\" But he said Platell's attitude was likely to alienate the gay readership that must have been arriving as a result of the paper's \"constructive approach\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
