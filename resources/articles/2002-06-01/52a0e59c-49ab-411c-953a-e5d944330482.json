A 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Jurgen Melzer, the 21-year-old former Wimbledon junior champion, was achieved with a bold and forthright performance which suggested that his best run at SW19 may yet be ahead of him. Rusedski's great start, in which he broke straight away, freed him to take chances with returns of serve and passes. He also took risks by getting in so close that he defied Melzer to lob him and, despite a small blip when he dropped serve near the end, he won at canter. This was a great encouragement. By taking a month off and focusing most of the first half on the year around doing well at Wimbledon, Rusedski is not only copying what Goran Ivanisevic did last year, but tacitly admitting that his body may not hold out much longer. \"I was very pleased with the way I played,\" he said. \"He's quite a good player and I managed to get on top from the start. I've not had a very good three years. But every time you enter a tournament you have a chance.\" He refused to get sucked into responses to a book written by Pat Cash, his former coach, who had called him \"tight\". Experience, maturity and improved fitness, he believed, still gave him a shot. He left, as he left the court, with a brief grim smile. There was nearly an even better British success, but Jamie Delgado, having turned a match round from the brink of defeat, missed three match points and was beaten. The man who was omitted from Britain's Davis Cup debacle against Ecuador at Wimbledon two years ago, was 5-3 and 40-30 up in the final set and then 5-4 and 40-15 up on his serve in the final set against Britain's persecutor, Nicolas Lapentti, but still could not make it. The 22nd seed eventually sneaked it 6-3, 6-2, 6-7, 4-6, 7-5, but almost certainly would not have done if Delgado had not over-cooked a sequence of approach shots at the crucial moments. Always a fluent groundstroker, Delgado sometimes outplayed Lapentti from the back. \"I fought as hard as I could and I really thought I was going to turn it around,\" he said. But then Lapentti won a crucial rally at 5-5 after defending against three smashes and then playing a shot through his legs. Elsewhere British players tumbled more quickly. James Auckland was denied the chance of a Wimbledon debut just an hour before the start because of injury and Arvind Parmar became the tournament's first men's loser. Auckland suffered a fractured second metatarsal in the left foot. Parmar lasted little more than an hour and a half against Thomas Enqvist, no grass-court expert but sometimes able to look like one during a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory. Parmar managed less than a 50% first serve record which meant that there was often time for Enqvist to wind up and launch heavy returns. Lucie Ahl gained only four games from the 13th seeded Meghann Shaughnessy while the British No1 Julie Pullin had perhaps the most discouraging defeat of the lot. After seven Wimbledon appearances she had been in the best form of her career this year and was full of confidence that this time she she would break her duck. But after a bright start and a tight final set Pullin was beaten 6-7, 6-1, 6-4 by Maja Matevzic, a Slovenian ranked 57 in the world. Barry Cowan, though, did win. The left-handed Lancastrian produced the best win of his career and his second at Wimbledon, and held his serve throughout a 6-7, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 success against the 69th ranked Hungarian Attila Savolt. Moreover Cowan achieved it despite not having had a good year since taking Pete Sampras to five sets last time and being banned from using the Walkman which famously assisted him then, in case it was being used for illegal coaching. Once again, but for the wild card, Cowan would not have been here. The policy of giving modestly ranked Britons a freebie has come in for increasing criticism, but Cowan volunteered that without the wild card he had last year and the income it supplied, he would not now be playing at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
