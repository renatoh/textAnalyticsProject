Brennan Gilmore, a counter-protester at the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally who had captured footage of the car attack that killed Heather Heyer, filed the lawsuit on Tuesday against Jones, Jim Hoft of the pro-Trump conspiracy site Gateway Pundit, and five others. After Gilmore posted video of the attack last August and spoke to the media, he quickly became the subject of viral conspiracy narratives falsely claiming he was a CIA or \u201cdeep state\u201d agent who helped orchestrate the violence as part of a government operation. \u201cI naively wasn\u2019t expecting any backlash from doing these interviews and condemning something that I thought we would universally condemn \u2013 the resurgence of Nazis,\u201d Gilmore told the Guardian. \u201cIt was just sort of a full flood of hate mail, death threats and harassment.\u201d Georgetown Law\u2019s civil rights clinic has filed the suit at a time of growing concern about conspiracy theories surrounding major US events, which have proliferated on social media and led to widespread abuse of survivors of mass shootings and families of those killed in tragedies. There have also been increasing stories of real-world consequences, including a 2016 shooting inspired by the \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton and a pizza shop, and more recently, harassment at a church in a small Texas town that suffered one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. Infowars and Gateway Pundit have repeatedly faced accusations of spreading lies and producing content that leads to massive harassment campaigns. Gilmore, who is a musician and has worked as a foreign service officer for the US state department, said he had publicized his footage and spoken to reporters in hopes of setting the record straight. He said the conspiracy theory posts and abuse began immediately, including some \u201calt-right\u201d people publicizing the address of his parents, who live in the region. In addition to violent online threats, Gilmore said he received physical hate mail, including a package with a powdery substance. He said some conspiracy theorists have confronted him on the street and that even though months have passed, someone recently threatened that his body would end up in a local river. \u201cIt has fundamentally changed my life,\u201d said Gilmore, who noted that someone has also threatened to show up to one of his band\u2019s shows. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly concerned about the capacity for this to happen to other people and the danger this poses to our country.\u201d Some content targeting Gilmore was headlined \u201cState Department/CIA Orchestrated Charlottesville Tragedy\u201d and \u201cRandom Man at Protests Interviewed by MSNBC, NY Times is Deep State Shill\u201d. Allen West, a former Florida congressman and Fox News contributor who was also named in the lawsuit, had published an article called, \u201cBOMBSHELL: New evidence suggests Charlottesville was a complete SET-UP\u201d. Andrew Mendrala, supervising attorney of the Georgetown law clinic, said Gilmore had a strong defamation case given the harm he suffered, adding that he hoped the suit would help prevent these kinds of damaging conspiracy theories. \u201cThe first amendment does not protect this type of speech. We think a victory would really protect people like Brennan in the future,\u201d Mendrala said in an interview. Gilmore said sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook should do a better job limiting the spread of malicious content, noting they were slow to respond to his complaints about harassment. \u201cThese social media companies unleashed an incredibly potent force, and it\u2019s one that can be used for good and one that can be used for bad,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThey can\u2019t quite keep up.\u201d YouTube in particular has faced intensifying scrutiny for its algorithms promoting conspiracy theories, fake news and far-right propaganda in recent years. Gilmore said he was aware that speaking out could invite further abuse and that he has been forced to consult security experts about how to protect himself and his family: \u201cDespite the personal risk involved, this is incredibly important to pursue.\u201d Infowars, Jones and West did not respond to requests for comment. Hoft said in an email that the lawsuit was \u201cbullshit\u201d and \u201cfull of lies\u201d, adding, \u201cThere is no case.\u201d He did not elaborate, but published a response on Gateway Pundit on Tuesday that called Gilmore an \u201cunhinged leftie hack\u201d and repeated many of the conspiracy claims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
