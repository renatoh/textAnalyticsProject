Its surprise admission, less than two weeks after playing down any exposure, triggered an 8% drop in its shares, prompting a sell-off among other big continental insurers such as Allianz and Axa. This blow to confidence was intensified by remarks from Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank chief executive, that the credit crisis would last into next year and slow world growth, especially in the US. However, he ruled out a global recession, pointing to robust growth in emerging markets, oil-exporting states and Europe. Swiss Re is the first insurer to admit to losses from the sub-prime crisis. It also said it had suffered a SFr300m loss on its own investment portfolio and warned that it could suffer further write-downs. US and European banks are expected to report further sub-prime losses. George Quinn, chief financial officer, said the write-downs were \"deeply embarrassing\" and Swiss Re had not foreseen the \"unprecedented and severe\" downgrades by credit rating agencies last month. Jacques Aigrain, chief executive, said the speed of the deterioration in financial markets and the size of the loss urgently required more pro-active management of risk. He reaffirmed Swiss Re's commitment to its SFr6bn share buyback programme and earnings targets. The firm said its write-downs came from exposure to two credit default swaps written to provide protection for a fall in the value of a client's portfolio. These were mainly mortgage-backed securities, including collateralised debt obligations that had been marked down to zero. The sub-prime securities, it said, had been written down to 62% of their original value, with the overall portfolio cut to SFr3.6bn. This month, Swiss Re reported a 5% drop in third-quarter earnings to SFr1.47bn but said its sub-prime exposure was limited."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
