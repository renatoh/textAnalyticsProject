The Labor defector Ronan Lee briefly flew the green flag in the leafy westside Brisbane electorate of Indooroopilly. The former journalist and publicist Scott Emerson snagged the seat in 2009 on his path to the upper ranks of the Liberal National party. But the ground has shifted somewhat under the shadow treasurer\u2019s feet, with a redistribution that now has halved Emerson\u2019s notional margin to 3%, in a new seat called Maiwar which retains a definite green tinge among its educated, \u201cpost-material\u201d constituency. Emerson, the incumbent and the only candidate who lives in the electorate, betrays no sign of anxiety that he could fall prey to a reverse case of what in 2012 the LNP called a \u201cdecapitation strategy\u201d (the targeting of senior Labor MPs who were ousted in a landslide). \u201cMaiwar will be a very tough contest and I\u2019ll be facing the challenges of Labor, the Greens, unions and GetUp all campaigning against me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s very positive feeling out there but I\u2019m not taking anything for granted.\u201d The Greens candidate Amy MacMahon\u2019s ground assault on the Labor deputy premier, Jackie Trad, in South Brisbane has drawn most of the attention leading up to the 25 November polling day, but some Greens campaigners think an upset victory in Maiwar is their best chance on paper. Their candidate is Michael Berkman, an environmental lawyer who has acted in conservation group court challenges to Adani\u2019s proposed Carmichael coalmine. His was the first public voice calling for Labor to veto a loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. \u201cI feel like I know the detail of this project as well as anyone does,\u201d Berkman says. \u201cI would absolutely be happy to take anyone to task on their support for a project that in so many respects doesn\u2019t stack up.\u201d Labor sources say their candidate, Ali King, will finish second to Emerson on primaries and that the tightest contest will involve Trad, who would still prevail in South Brisbane. But the Greens point to pulling more primary votes than Labor in 23 out of 26 booth counts within Maiwar in the last federal and council elections. The Greens figure they need an extra 1,554 votes \u2013 a 5% to 6% swing \u2013 and have enlisted 120 people to knock on 12,217 doors. Their Maiwar campaign has received backing from one of the more prominent and less conventional figures of the Australian corporate landscape: the Wotif co-founder Graeme Wood. Wood, who is also an investor in Guardian Australia, has donated $5,000 to the campaign. This will pay for a dedicated campaigner to field and coordinate a burgeoning number of volunteers, who the Greens say are coming in faster than they can handle. Five hundred have already signed up. A day before Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s dramatic and unexpected move last week to pledge to veto any federal loan for Adani, the former Australian Greens leader, Bob Brown, told the Guardian: \u201cHere\u2019s the curious thing: we\u2019ve got a leading Greens candidate who\u2019s got the solution for either of the big parties that wants to deal with the most unpopular part of the Adani package, and that\u2019s giving taxpayers\u2019 money to this filthy rich corporate.\u201d Brown added with an element of prescience: \u201cIt\u2019d be a very popular move but of course, [Palaszczuk] has painted herself into a corner. But it\u2019s amazing what people will do when elections appear to be slipping out of their grasp.\u201d Thie week Brown said a belated veto by a returned Labor government was \u201cnot quite the nail in the coffin for Adani\u201d. But the election of any of the three most likely Greens candidates \u2013 Berkman, MacMahon, and the environmental scientist Kirsten Lovejoy in the inner northside Brisbane seat of McConnel \u2013 would be \u201ca hammer blow on Adani\u2019s progress\u201d, Brown says. Berkman tells the Guardian a Greens MP in a hung parliament where One Nation has leached away major-party votes could play an unusually pivotal role. \u201cI think with Adam Bandt [the federal Melbourne MP] and Jonathan Sri [the first Brisbane Greens councillor], we\u2019ve seen just how influential the Greens can be even when they\u2019re a single member of a parliament or chamber,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes it to a whole new level when you\u2019ve got tight parliaments. I think the Greens can play a really pivotal role in this next parliament in terms of being there on the crossbench to counteract some of the risks that come with One Nation having a role again.\u201d The question of the LNP ultimately cutting a deal with One Nation to guarantee supply for a minority government \u2013 and its unspoken reservation of the right to preference the Hansonites in vulnerable Labor seats in defiance of a now-defunct bipartisan shunning of One Nation \u2013 is unlikely to play well with small \u201cl\u201d liberals who support the LNP in Maiwar. Asked about the prospect of supporters becoming disenchanted by this, Emerson says \u201cthe only reason that preferences are even an issue is that Labor changed the voting system\u201d because it wanted to harvest spent Greens preferences in key seats such as Maiwar. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019ve seen so far is that One Nation is going to put sitting members last and that means if One Nation are preferencing in Maiwar they\u2019re going to preference Labor ahead of me,\u201d he says. Emerson says he does have people asking him about Adani in terms of party policy. \u201cI explain to them that our view is that it is a project that has very stringent environmental criteria that it\u2019s had to pass through. But also it\u2019s important in terms of creating jobs for Queensland. \u201cI try to have a sensible and honest discussion with people about it. Some people won\u2019t agree with what I say but most of the people are just pleased I\u2019m happy to talk to them and address those issues with them.\u201d Emerson says that \u201cobviously the Green vote has always been very high in my electorate, that\u2019s nothing new\u201d. \u201cThe first time I ran, it was 25%,\u201d he says. As the aspiring treasurer, Emerson would be carrying the can for the Adani Naif loan, which the LNP supports in the face of what even its leader, Tim Nicholls, acknowledges is majority opposition. Emerson sent out a letter to constituents that listed \u201cconcern for the future of the Great Barrier Reef\u201d as among the three biggest issues for locals. His proposal is fairly unspecific: \u201cWe need to form an alliance between reef users to ensure the Great Barrier Reef is protected.\u201d Whether or not this cuts it with Maiwar voters depends on the resonance of another issue Emerson insists he is asked about more often, even in one of Queensland\u2019s most affluent seats: living costs. \u201cParticularly electricity prices and particularly in the last six months,\u201d he says, pointing also to issues such as substandard rail services and traffic jams. \u201cI always make sure that I explain to people that we take a balanced approach to those issues.\u201d The Adani proposal has played a larger role in the state election than many expected, including Berkman. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great testament to just how significant this issue is in the eyes of the community.\u201d Berkman says while Labor is calling for the mine to stand on its own two feet, he would push in parliament for legislative steps to undo the concessions granted to the miner, such as its unlimited licence to tap groundwater. Brown says the Greens \u2013 who in the past have had to be content with their leading lights including Drew Hutton being \u201cthe best parliamentarian Queensland never had\u201d \u2013 have a chance to break their sunshine state hoodoo. \u201cThere\u2019s a great conjunction here of three winnable electorates, three very solid and attractive candidates, and the biggest environmental and economic issue to confront the electorate in Queensland in at least two decades,\u201d he says. \u201cWhichever way you look at it, people who oppose the Adani mine can\u2019t vote elsewhere but the Greens. And it\u2019s a vote changer, at least as potent as the Franklin dam was 35, 40 years ago. \u201cQueenslanders have got it sweet because they\u2019ve got good options. It\u2019s one of those elections where everything\u2019s up for grabs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting event when it comes.\u201d \u2022 Support our independent journalism and critical reporting on the environment by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
