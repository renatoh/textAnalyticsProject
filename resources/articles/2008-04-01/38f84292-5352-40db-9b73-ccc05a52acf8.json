Tom Lakes, by email This is a terribly depressing question, not because of the question itself but because it leads us down a sad path to a place where celebrities are no use at all. Yes, certainly, three photos of celebrities wearing blue dresses is incontrovertible proof that blue must be a Good Thing at the moment. And two paparazzi snaps of the girls from Hollyoaks sporting something that they call an \"all-in-one\" overrides any qualms one might have about wearing what is, to all intents and purposes, a boiler suit. But, shockingly, in regards to how one should arrange oneself when posing for a photo while wearing a blue all-in-one, the celebrities provide no guidance at all. Instead they abandon us, like lost babes in a cold, dark wood. But we shouldn't be too hard on them because they clearly have not the slightest clue how to pose either. Look at them! It is the rare celebrity who has not neurotically clung to the same rigid pose in every photo taken of them for the past 20 years. Halle Berry is, for me, the classic example, always doing that weird wave, with her arm bent at a perfect 45-degree angle and her mouth agape, as if shouting to her closest friends. Sharon Stone has her favourite pose, too (knees bent, fingers pointing to unspecified friend, mouth open in delight). This really says something: here is a woman who has flashed her how's-your-mother to the world, but even she self-consciously clings to the same fake pose in front of the camera. Then there's Tom Cruise's rictus grin; Alistair Campbell's crossed arms and scowl; even Kate ruddy Moss, with her mouth half open and her eyes half closed - they're all at it, neurotically clinging to the same damn pose over and over. And who can blame them? Posing for photos is scary and fraught with perils (except for Moss: considering her only soi-disant \"job\" is to pose for the camera, you'd think she'd come up with one more facial expression for the task, but no matter). The sad fact is, life is unfair and some people just look good in pictures and the rest of us look like we've just seen Jonathan Ross having sex. The only solution is to pose like you're not posing; at least then when you look a right munter, people will say, \"Well, of course she was caught unaware.\" The other alternative, a friend of mine recently told me, is to say the word \"prune\" as the shutter clicks. A Hollywood trick, apparently. Admittedly, when he tried this on holiday recently the result was he had to throw away all the photos of himself, but at least it explains what the hell Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is doing in her photos. How should one dress on an airplane? Conrad Kennedy, by email Two schools of thought on this one: dress up smart in the hope the airport staff will be so taken with your fabulous ensemble that they bump you up to first, or say \"the hell with it\" and dress for comfort in the full knowledge that airline staff are busy enough losing your bags and delaying your planes to give any thought to upgrading anybody. But there is an alternative approach. A friend of mine was recently on a flight from New York to London. The on-flight look he decided to go for consisted of a leather jacket, dark jeans and a top hat - in short, he looked like Slash from Guns N' Roses. Contrary to pretty much anyone's expectations, this turned out to work in his favour because, as happy chance would have it, the Rolling Stones were on his plane, so ground staff at his destination assumed my friend was with the band (obviously no civilian would dress as he did) and whisked him through security and (most thrillingly) reunited him with his bags. So apropos of the first question, here we have another example of why it's good to dress like a celebrity. On the other hand, if you're flying from Heathrow Terminal 5, I advise flying while wearing all your clothes at the same time and bundling up like the Michelin man. This will reduce the chances of some of your wardrobe being stranded in Milan when you're in Manchester. And it might also increase your chances of being mistaken for Slash. So, like, win, win!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
