Add to these Titan, a Brooklyn quartet whose first proper studio album is a monumental slab of progressive heaviosity that ebbs and flows beautifully through psychedelic rock forms old and new. Largely instrumental and split into four long suites, A Raining Sun ... quickly hits a dramatic full pelt, all surging guitar fuzz and wailing organ, closest in sound to 1970s explorers such as Goblin or Amon Duul in its tendency to repetition of fast, complex melodic loops. Later, the focus switches to swirling storms of echo and feedback, and later still to a lissom, krautrock-y patter and skip. Expansive, thrilling and unusually economical at just over 40 minutes, it's a sure-fire hit for fans of the far-out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
