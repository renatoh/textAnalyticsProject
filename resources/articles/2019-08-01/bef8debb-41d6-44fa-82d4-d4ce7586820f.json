It shouted a question at commuters, in black capital letters: \u201cARE YOU BEACH BODY READY?\u201d The guilt-inducing answer, implicitly, was no. In their first Edinburgh fringe show, The Roaring Girls pose that same question and reply to it with a big fat yes. This won\u2019t all be cheesy inspirational mottos and #bodypositivity, warn performers Rachael Abbey, Jess Morley and Sarah Penney. Beach Body Ready is a show about finding joy in your body, but it\u2019s also honest about all the forces eroding that joy, from women\u2019s magazines to Instagram filters. Rachael, Jess and Sarah candidly share their own struggles to accept their bodies, joining the dots between personal experience and a patriarchal system. Crucially, The Roaring Girls make it clear that this is a feminist issue. It\u2019s less about labels like \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cskinny\u201d and more about the myriad ways in which society polices women\u2019s bodies and saps their energy. More than once, performers talk about taking up space. That\u2019s how these women resist: by unapologetically taking up space with their bodies and their experiences, refusing to be shamed into silence. The Roaring Girls\u2019 observations and frustrations are nothing new, but that in itself is damning. We\u2019ve been fighting this fight for a long time and not much has changed. Sure, there\u2019s the body positivity movement, but more often than not \u2013 as The Roaring Girls wryly observe \u2013 that\u2019s just another way of selling stuff to women. We\u2019ve heard this all before, but it still needs saying. What Beach Body Ready lacks in originality, it makes up for in charm. The women are immensely likeable performers, with the kind of emotional frankness and comic timing more often found in confessional standup. Directly addressing the audience throughout, they\u2019re engaging, funny and inclusive, injecting their stories with warmth and wit. As The Roaring Girls admit, they are unlikely to single-handedly smash the patriarchy with this show. But they can stick up two fingers to misogyny and body-shaming while dancing to some banging tunes. It\u2019s a start. \u2022 At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 26 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
