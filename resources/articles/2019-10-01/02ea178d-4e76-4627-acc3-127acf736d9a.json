In May, a day after it emerged that a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Edinburgh had been asked by police not to sell milkshakes because it was located within 200 metres of where Farage was to hold a rally and protesters might throw them, Burger King tweeted: \u201cDear people of Scotland. We\u2019re selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun. Love BK. #justsaying\u201d. Farage had previously been hit by a milkshake in Newcastle city centre, after a spate of similar incidents against far-right candidates in the European elections campaign, a form of protest known as \u201cmilkshaking\u201d. Farage was scheduled to make more public appearances in Scotland following the Burger King tweet. The Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation into whether the tweet broke UK advertising rules and should be banned, after it received 24 complaints that it was irresponsible and offensive because it encouraged violence and antisocial behaviour. \u201cWe considered that the [tweet] was likely to be seen as a reference to the recent incidents of \u2018milkshaking\u2019 political figures,\u201d said the ASA. \u201cWe considered it would be understood as suggesting that Burger King milkshakes could be used by people to \u2018milkshake\u2019 Nigel Farage.\u201d Burger King UK, which has almost 50,000 Twitter followers, was criticised at the time for inciting violence. It posted a follow-up tweet that said: \u201cWe\u2019d never endorse violence \u2013 or wasting delicious milkshakes! So enjoy the weekend and please drink responsibly people.\u201d The burger chain said the tweet was meant to be a \u201ctongue-in-cheek reaction\u201d to recent events where milkshakes had been thrown at political figures. The ASA disagreed and said the tweet broke UK advertising rules governing social responsibility and harm and offence. \u201cWe considered that the ad condoned the previous antisocial behaviour and encouraged further instances,\u201d the ASA said. \u201cWe therefore concluded the ad was irresponsible. We told Burger King to ensure that its future marketing communications did not condone or encourage antisocial behaviour.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
