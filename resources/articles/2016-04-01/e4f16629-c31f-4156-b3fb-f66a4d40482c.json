Di Mar\u00eda became the British record transfer when signing from Real Madrid in summer 2014 for \u00a359.7m. Yet he left 12 months later for Paris Saint-Germain having scored only four goals and made 32 appearances, of which 13 were starts. After Di Mar\u00eda complained that he was too often shifted around by Van Gaal, the Dutchman said: \u201cI have never seen [many] players who look at themselves, who look to the way they have performed. It is always the fault of the manager. So he is one of the players who are in a row of players who have no self-criticism. Unfortunately it is my life as a manager. It is always like that.\u201d Di Mar\u00eda told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to say certain things but it\u2019s more that they didn\u2019t let me settle properly than I couldn\u2019t settle. I left and that team are still playing the same way. Out of the European competitions, far from being champions of the Premier League. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was my fault or the fault of my team-mates. Every time I was given the opportunity, I did all I could but it didn\u2019t work out as I hoped. So I decided to leave, not only to be happy but to win things. I started a game in one position then the next game in another. I scored goals playing in one position, then suddenly the next game I was picked to play in a different position.\u201d Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s PSG face Manchester City in Wednesday evening\u2019s Champions League quarter-final first leg in Paris. It is a competition United hope to participate in next season but Van Gaal believes he could remain as United manager even if the side fail to qualify. United are in sixth place on 50 points, one point behind City, who are in fourth, and have eight matches left. At the end of the season Van Gaal will have a year left on the three-year contract he signed in the summer of 2014. Asked if he would be surprised to remain should United finish outside the top four, Van Gaal said: \u201cI cannot say that because I do not know the next eight matches. You can only evaluate when you have the total facts. The board has to evaluate after the results of this year, what they have to do. That is normal. I cannot predict that when I do not know the facts. \u201cThe results and Champions League positions you can only say in May and then you have to evaluate the circumstances I had to work in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
