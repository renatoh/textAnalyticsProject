Unsurprising, really, since this bit of the Financial Services Authority's paper does not contain any juicy statistics or dramatic proposals. Instead, the chapter called \"Disclosure and changing consumer behaviour\" lays out the FSA's new approach to supervising the home-loan market \u2013 and it upends the regulator's previous policies. The way the FSA used to regulate mortgages was simple: it saw consumers as \"rational market participants\". So, as long as the home buyer, the broker and the lender were all legal and consenting adults, the watchdog believed it was best off minding its own business. No more. Adair Turner and his team now talk about their \"greater realism about the behavioural biases that drive excess borrowing\". And they promise to \"be more interventionist to help protect consumers from themselves\". After the days of 125% mortgages and liars' loans, it would be shocking if this watchdog were not going to be more vigilant; what is more interesting is that it now accepts the old caveat emptor days are over. Some will criticise the FSA for adopting a new stance of \"nanny knows best\", but there is precious little evidence of heavy-handedness in the proposals that stem from this new philosophy. These are the bits that have been much written about \u2013 and they reek of nothing so much as common sense. Self-certification mortgages will be effectively banned. Borrowers will have to prove they can actually afford the repayments on new loans. And lenders will have to show they have made the necessary checks. Predictably enough, the loan industry has kicked up a fuss about all this, claiming that these reforms will only worsen the mortgage drought \u2013 and that signs of a new era of paternalism is nigh. But these are only proposals that will be debated until next year. And besides, this is hardly a throwback to the old days of loan rationing, just some new speed bumps. As the US sub-prime crisis shows, free-and-easy lending can harm not only the overborrowed and the eager lenders \u2013 but can also do great damage all round. Still, it is the shift in the regulatory mindset that is the most interesting. The orthodoxy that individuals are always rational has been shown by behavioural economists as so much wishful thinking, but it is only beginning to be applied to public policy. Lord Turner has been at the forefront, with his proposals to reform pension contributions. The Office of Fair Trading has also recently opened a behavioural-economics group. This wave could go on for a long time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
