Her choice of title confirms that Soho is no longer tainted by its seedy past as a haunt of hacks, drunks and prostitutes, but is now a hang out for the young, rich and fashionable (although she did fleetingly release on to the virtual world something to do with nipple tassels). Choosing a title is as complex as justifying the continued existence of an unelected second chamber, and most people keep it simple. In the days of the entirely unreformed house, the benches were packed with ancient titles often incorporating several small towns, like the Baron Mowbray, Segrave and Stourton. The odd viscount has escaped the cull \u2013 Brougham and Vaux, for example \u2013 and distant battles still echo names like Allenby of Megiddo. In the main, though, it is less colourful, and only a little less anachronistic. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2014. The earlier version said incorrectly that the speech on Thursday by Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho was her maiden speech."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
