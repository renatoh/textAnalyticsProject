Australia's third Test defeat in a row has been described in blaring headlines of which \"The End of the World\" is one of the less extreme. These are just a few snap-shots from the most emotional of weeks, where doom and gloom has descended upon Australian rugby, primarily because their Trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand humiliated them by a record 50-21 score in Sydney last weekend. Reality has suddenly hit. For so long, Australians believed the 2003 World Cup would be rugby's version of the 2000 Sydney Olympics with endless golden moments. Now there are considerable fears that the hosts will struggle to get even to the semi-finals. The reasons for Australia's decline are many. But the crucial elements are that the trendsetters have now been passed by so many teams, in particular New Zealand and England, who have utilised their ideas, and taken them to another level. Australia have struggled to adapt from a rigid style that worked in the 1999 World Cup but is now outdated. The then Wallaby coach Rod Macqueen was regarded as a saviour, but his philosophy relied on no mistakes, no-frills football, and only limited adventure. The emphasis was on bashing the ball up the middle of the field. Attacking players were more battering rams than fleet-footed adventurers. Since then, the game has become far more expansive and New Zealand, as shown in their recent thrashings of South Africa and Australia, are prepared to attack extravagantly from any spot of the field, and from any situation, most often from turnover ball. Five of New Zealand's seven tries against Australia came immediately after the Wallabies lost possession. Since 1999 Australia have struggled to move on, their lack of depth has been exposed, and they have also paid the price for not getting their back line right. Since 1999, they have played 12 different centre combinations, while the introduction of three former Kangaroo rugby league representatives has involved initiation pains. Wendell Sailor, Lote Tuqiri and Mat Rogers appeared for the first time together in the starting line-up against the All Blacks last week, and all had problems with the different defensive structure. They were often at sea when two or three All Black attacking players were running at them. There is also the question of whether this Australian team has the required hunger or passion. The former Australian back rower Sam Scott-Young echoed the thoughts of many when he said after the All Black defeat: \"This Australian team has gone soft, and they've got to get tough. Against the All Blacks, there was no bash in them, no heart, no passion, no anger, no nothing.\" For Australia to get out of an ever deepening rut, the team's pace and passion must improve dramatically. The Springboks, who love baiting Australia, have kept up the pressure this week. South Africa's coach Rudolf Straeuli has been playing mind games, arguing that if Australia persist in picking senior, experienced players who keep losing, panic is bound to set in. Many believe that in the Wallaby camp panic has already set in Australia: Latham; Sailor, Rogers, Flatley, Tuqiri; Larkham, Gregan (capt); Young, Cannon, Noriega, Vickerman, Giffin, Smith, Waugh, Kefu.
