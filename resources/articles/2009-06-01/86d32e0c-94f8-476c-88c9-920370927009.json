Bank of England governor Mervyn King made it clear in a parliamentary hearing he thought the Treasury was not doing enough to prevent the return of excess in the City. We have all railed against duck houses and flipping of homes to avoid capital gains tax, but we should be more angry with bankers because the credit crunch will cost us all thousands of pounds each over the next decade in terms of failed businesses, jobs lost and the bailout of banks. Inexplicably, the Treasury's arms-length body, UKFI, agreed to grant up to \u00a315m to Stephen Hester if he succeeds in turning round the state-owned wreck that is the Royal Bank of Scotland. \u00a315m! Stephen Green runs HSBC for \u00a31m, a princely sum to most of us but a lot less than Hester supposedly needs to do his job. You would think the myth of bankers needing to be paid a fortune because they were so clever would have been well and truly smashed by the events of the past two years. No wonder King thinks the Treasury has lost the plot. The problem is that reforming the banking system and designing regulations to ensure the excesses of recent years do not build up again is a complex process. King doubtless suspects a fading Labour government does not have the energy to start something that will only be completed under the next government. Good times Also, the Treasury has long been in thrall to the City and tends to hire investment bankers to advise it whenever it can. And Labour has depended on the huge tax revenues that flowed in until last year to pay for its tax credits project and health and education spending. It is being heavily lobbied by the bankers to let the goose get back to laying its golden eggs and drive the economy forward. Never mind that Britain has world-beating top-end manufacturers, a big aerospace industry, huge pharmaceuticals businesses and great service providers in law, accounting, shipping and so on. They don't seem to count. There is some evidence that the good times are already beginning to roll in the City again. A sign of the resilience and flexibility of bankers? No. Merely because, with some banks having been wiped out, the remaining business is shared by fewer banks. And their fixed-income departments are coining it, trading all the bonds the government is having to issue to pay for the economic mess that the banks got us into in the first place. You couldn't make it up. A fundamental question we have to ask, though, is whether we want a City that may pay lots of tax in the good times but lays the whole economy to waste when it goes bust. No is the answer, and reining in the City is both possible and worth the effort. The idea that global finance is too global to control is simply wrong. That's why the Bank's bi-annual Financial Stability Report, published on Friday, makes for fascinating reading (www.bankofengland.co.uk). It lays out a detailed review of the kinds of measures that need to be carried out. These include limiting the size of banks, making them carry extra capital reserves, forcing them to publish plans to wind themselves up if they go bust, and putting credit derivatives onto exchanges so they can be monitored. If shareholders in banks knew that they would lose their money in a bust with no taxpayer support, they might be less keen to nod through management's wheezes for making money from products that few understand. It might also make them reject bankers' overblown pay packages because they want the money used to build up the bank's capital reserves instead. Under Threadneedle Street's proposals, banks face a regime change where they are less profitable but less risky too \u2013 something that represents a better return for the wider economy and society. The financial services sector only accounts for around 8% of British national income but has the ability to wreck much of the other 92%. It needs to be brought under control. It appears that the Treasury, stung by King's criticism, is keen to get tough. But don't bank on it having the will to go ahead. Don't expect the Tories to do it either \u2013 the bankers are doubtless raising questions over their contributions to party funds if they are re-regulated. Fragile shoots The Bank's stability review also expressed alarm at the continued problems in the banking sector, such as its huge exposure to falling commercial property prices, which are down more than 40% from the peak. It says further crises in the banks could require even more public money to bail them out. No wonder King remains gloomy, even though things appear to have stopped falling dramatically. He thinks the \"green shoots\" that people are talking about are very fragile. Consumers are still carrying lots of debt they will have to pay down. The CBI reported last week that retail sales fell for a second month running and economists fear consumer spending could remain depressed for a long time, especially with unemployment continuing to rise. Consultancy Capital Economics thinks joblessness could rise until 2011 or even 2012, meaning that while the recession might end in the technical sense this year, it may not feel like it for a long time. That is likely to mean more mortgage defaults landing on banks. The housing market, too, is likely to continue to worsen. Mortgage approvals have picked up, but they remain far below the monthly level consistent with rising prices. And fixed mortgage rates have just gone up by half a point because of rising bond yields. That will dent confidence. While base rates are at just 0.5%, first-time buyers face rates of 5% or more and buy-to-let mortgages can only be had at around 7%. The so-called \"transmission mechanism\" for interest rates has been blunted. Thus it is hard to see prices rising soon. They have only fallen 20% so far and remain on many measures overvalued. Small and medium-sized businesses are telling the Bank of England they cannot get finance on reasonable terms from their banks \u2013 certainly at nothing like 0.5%. The banks say they would lend but there is no demand for their money. Who would you rather believe? Any recovery could yet be punctured by another crisis in the banking system or another sharp rise in oil prices. A so-called \"double-dip\" recession cannot be ruled out. We remain a long way from getting out of this mess and once the indignation over MPs' expenses subsides, we should get back to being angry with the bankers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
