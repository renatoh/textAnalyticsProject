The most notorious of these, however, is the education maintenance allowance (EMA), a means-tested grant of up to \u00a330 a week for 16- to 19-year-olds who choose to remain in education after their GCSEs. The EMA was not universally popular when it was introduced in 2004. Grants of \u00a330 a week are paid directly into the bank accounts of sixth-formers in homes with incomes up to \u00a320,817; \u00a320 a week if it is \u00a320,818-\u00a325,521; and \u00a310 for incomes of \u00a325,522-\u00a330,810. The Lib Dems said they could \"think of better ways of spending \u00a320m\". The Tories called it \"a bribe\", so it was a surprise when they said a Conservative government would not scrap it \u2013 though David Willetts has hinted that a Tory government would cut the level of funding. Perhaps they had noticed that the EMA is not exclusive to Labour voters and that plenty of Tories now find themselves in the income bracket that qualifies their children for the grant, namely under \u00a330,000 a year. (Think of all those redundant City financiers now opting for teaching careers.) In fact, given that the vast majority of A- and AS-level students in the country are still drawn from the traditionally Conservative middle classes, the cross-party appeal of the EMA is not difficult to understand. However, there are allegations that the system is being exploited. In a recent letter to the Guardian, a 17-year-old correspondent at a \u00a312,000-a-year private school told of their \"blind fury\" at abuses of the EMA scheme \u2013 of students who ran their own cars and owned their own laptops yet received top\u2013whack EMAs, which they spent on booze, fags and going-out clothes. Of 100 students in the year-group, the writer alleged, 15 to 20 received full EMAs. The reason they qualified: their parents were divorced and they lived with their mums. Still, the behaviour of the smokers, drinkers and revellers was presumably not so bad as to miss or disrupt classes, or they would have forfeited their awards. The system has a built-in compliancy guarantee. Eligible students receive payment only if they register for every class and incur no teacher's complaint about their behaviour. And they can earn bonuses of \u00a3100 for commendable results. Accordingly, EMAs have improved attendance and performance. \"It's fabulous!\" says Angela Edwards, head of quality at Westminster Kingsway sixth-form college, of the EMA. \"It actually enables students to come to college. I don't mean they spend it on transport: they get free bus passes. But it facilitates their presence. We use it as a way of encouraging them to discipline themselves. They have to attend to get it. It's made a huge difference.\" \"Mostly what it does is appease parents,\" Edwards continues. \"It takes the worry away from them. They know they're not going to be pestered for money all the time and they know their children are not going to be absconding. Of course, there are abuses, but what system doesn't have those? And because the EMA is paid weekly, it maintains students' interest. They might just stop without it \u2013 although of course there's no way of telling.\" As a supply teacher, I have experienced the panic that comes upon students when they realise the school register will be taken by a stranger. I recently replaced a teacher who had had been held up in traffic on the way to school. \"Where's Miss?\" demanded James, a sixth-form health and social care student. \"If she don't register me, I don't get my EMA.\" Not having access to the school's computer system, I took a paper register, but James continued to fret. What if my list went missing? Single, loose documents disappear easily, as he well knew. He asked to shepherd it to the school office, just to make sure. There was a time when A- and AS-level candidates thought it uncool to be commended for punctuality. Now it's the difference between being comfortably off at the weekend and having to tap your parents for dosh they don't have. James's parents were always short. That's why he was eligible for the \u00a330 hand-out. \"My friends who receive it say it helps save money for university as they don't have time for a job,\" said Lauren, an A-level language student nearing the end of her course. \"I get \u00a320 and don't have a job, so it really does help save money for the long term. There are lots who mistreat the advantage \u2013 they spend it on techno \u2013 and some who don't get EMA say it's unfair that others get 'free money'.\" \"EMAs seem to be a pretty good incentive,\" says Ashley, another ineligible year 12 student. \"It can't be bad if it guarantees attendance. School's not much fun anyway and it would be even worse if people stopped turning up.\" But Ryan, an AS-level linguist, receives nothing and is resentful. \"It's a lot of money,\" he says. \"More than most people get for pocket money. I don't think it's fair.\" Although the official line is that the EMA is awarded so that students may off-set the cost of books, stationery or clothing, in many establishments sixth-formers are not required to wear uniform. In fact, few educationalists care what the grants are spent on as long as the students learn the benefits of application and regular attendance as a result. Most students, it seems, treat the windfall as pocket money, absolving them of the need to find a Saturday job. One of the A-level students I tutor privately, however, told me she receives \u00a320 a week \u2013 which is what I charge her parents. In a roundabout way, she is spending it on me. I'm all for it.
