The company, owned by Eon, the German energy giant, is already piloting a project in the sub-continent, where labour costs are much lower than in the West. A spokesman for Powergen confirmed on Friday that 'we are looking seriously at the issue; it is at a preliminary stage, but we could eventually switch 300 jobs to India, if all goes according to plan'. In the City, analysts suggested that an even higher number of Powergen's back office staff - which number 4,000 altogether - may lose their jobs if the group becomes more ruthless about cost-cutting and efficiency. But Powergen emphasised that its key billing operations and information technology division would remain in Britain. The company, which owns distributor East Midlands Electricity, as well as power plants up and down the country, has been hammered by the slump in wholesale electricity prices, following the introduction of new trading arrangements. Other utilities, including Centrica and Innogy, are also looking at the possibility of moving call centres overseas, although no firm decisions have yet been taken. British industry in general is in the process of employing more people in the Far East and Central Europe as pressure increases on companies to cut costs to offset their inability to boost profits by increasing their prices. Powergen may close two coal-fired power stations as a result of low wholesale prices that have crippled some of the country's largest generators. The plants are at Drakelow, near Burton-on-Trent, and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire. The depressed wholesale prices, which have plunged by 40 per cent since 1998, have led to heavy losses at many power stations. Powergen is closing more than a quarter of its capacity. \u00b7 A restructuring package for British Energy, the nuclear generator currently propped up by a government loan, is set to be accepted next week, writes Oliver Morgan. This would prevent the company from sliding into administration. Sources indicate that it is 99 per cent certain that bondholders will sign up to a deal that was outlined by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt in November. This deal would severely dilute their investments. Bondholders have held discussions with other creditors, including BNFL, in an attempt to reduce the company's liabilities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
