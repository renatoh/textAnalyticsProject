It is not clear what role the vessels will play, as asylum seeker vessels commonly depart from Indonesia, not Malaysia. The federal government recently came under scrutiny recently for giving two patrol boats to Sri Lanka, and placing no conditions on their use. The minister is longer holding weekly briefings, and last held a press conference 15 days ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
