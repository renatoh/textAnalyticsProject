But the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is not behind the idea, as she believes the country doesn\u2019t understand the process and does not support Trump\u2019s impeachment. She explained her reasoning by referencing Bye Bye Birdie. But Oliver argued against the choice of musical: \u201cIf this situation were to be a musical, it wouldn\u2019t be Bye Bye Birdie. It would obviously be Grease, where a rapey guy with weird hair treats women like shit and and yet somehow gets everything he\u2019s ever wanted.\u201d No president has been removed from office by impeachment, though two presidents have been impeached. The first step in the process is an impeachment inquiry. Then a House majority must vote to impeach, which then moves it to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority must vote to remove. The constitution says there are three grounds for impeachment: treason, bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors. Trump could be impeached for obstruction of justice. There is precedent, as these crimes were cited in the articles against former presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. The special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report detailed 11 instances where Trump or his campaign engaged in potential obstruction of justice. The most newsworthy occasion involved Don McGahn, the former White House counsel. \u201cYou might remember him as well as the understudy for Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. He was ready to jump in if Kavanaugh ever cried himself into an early nap,\u201d joked Oliver. McGahn threatened to resign after Trump asked him to do \u201ccrazy shit\u201d, as in tell the then deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, to fire Mueller. Trump apparently told McGahn: \u201cMueller has to go,\u201d \u201cCall me back when you do it\u201d and called him later to ask: \u201cHave you done it?\u201d When news got out about Trump\u2019s thwarted firing, he tried to get McGahn to release a statement denying he had tried to get Mueller fired. \u201cTo recap there, it seems the president obstructed justice. Then obstructed justice again to try to obstruct the investigation into his obstruction of justice,\u201d Oliver summarized. Despite growing calls and evidence against him, Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t leave. Oliver agreed with this, telling his audience: \u201cYeah, of course Trump wouldn\u2019t leave. You think he\u2019d hold a press conference and bashfully say into a camera: \u2018I was wrong?\u2019 In what reality would that happen? Then he\u2019d gracefully say: \u2018I would now let someone else be the president\u2019? You\u2019re insane! Then what? He\u2019d pack a suitcase and walk, physically walk out of the White House and just not be the president any more? No! He\u2019d make us drag him out like an uncooperative toddler. You know this!\u201d Oliver then used Trump\u2019s ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos to demonstrate how the president already believes he has gotten away with it, telling Stephanopoulos he would listen to information from foreign countries pertaining to opponents, probably not call the FBI, and said the FBI director was wrong to say that he should. \u201cIt is genuinely fascinating to watch Trump project his own immoral awfulness on to the rest of humanity.\u201d Oliver continued: \u201cHe\u2019s basically saying laws are a matter of opinion and you can trust your Uncle Don on this one. But of course, that is not true.\u201d The head of the Federal Election Commission had to release a statement to the contrary, reiterating its illegal nature. \u201cI know it\u2019s easy to be defeatist here because nothing has seemingly reined Trump in so far, but I will say this: every asshole succeeds until, finally, they don\u2019t.\u201d He closed out the segment: \u201cIf nothing else, we would be standing by the basic, fundamental principle, that nobody is above the law. And in doing so, it would mean that when people tell dying relatives that we\u2019re doing everything we can to hold this president accountable, at least this time, it would actually be true.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
