But his fear of losing at cricket exceeds his fear of the boss. When he spent most of last week organising a cricket match in memory of the late Simon Ferrari he didn't rely on the hacks who played Simon's old friends in the Farningham Cricket Club last year but roped in West Indian Test legends Richie Richardson, Sherwin Campbell, Junior Murray and Viv Richards (Richards pulled out at the last minute). Piers allowed four Mirror staff into the team: himself, chief reporter Gary Jones, 'chief traffic warden' Eugene Duffy and new lad Ryan Parry. Needless to say, Piers triumphed, but only just. Magic touch Associated Newspapers has a deft touch in nurturing readers. Secretary Sandra Smith, whose semi in Bracknell appeared in the Harry Potter films, has quite reasonably put it up for sale at a tidy profit after it featured as the evil Dursley family's home. Ms Smith loved the Mail On Sunday so much she gave it an exclusive look inside her home. For her pains, she was turned over by Property editor Sebastian O'Kelly, who sneers at the 'unremarkable' house. 'Normally houses on this estate sell for less than \u00a3250,000,' he notes sniffily. But 'in a move grasping Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would applaud, [Smith] is putting her house up for auction later this month ... and she won't take a penny less than \u00a3280,000.' Associated don't know which side its bread's buttered on. A plot straight from Shakespeare The IT department at the Evening Standard must be congratulated on its efficiency. A little local difficulty has blown up for Sebastian Shakespeare, editor of the Standard's Londoner's Diary, after a departing journalist left a bomb in the form of an email sent to all staff last Sunday. By Monday, all trace of it had been expunged from staff in-boxes and hacks were threatened with disciplinary action if it should surface. Diary would blush at some of the contents. We are sure claims of 'nepotism, harassment and abuse' are wide of the mark, but would love to see 'security footage' our scribe refers to. Who won't wear it? Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine will be biting the hand that feeds at the Edinburgh Television Festival, where they are giving Jane Root, who commissions their show What Not to Wear, a makeover, along with Dawn Airey. Diary hears the girls were good sports about the inevitable character assassinations. Not so Channel 4 chief executive Mark Thompson, targeted when he left the BBC. Chums arranged for the pair to gatecrash his leaving do and do their worst. 'He was not impressed,' says a source. It was made clear the tape should not see the light of day. After Greg Dyke's appearance last Sunday in a lime and soda suit, Diary would like to challenge BBC's fashion police: make the director-general a priority. Anil retentive Diary readers may still be grieving over the untimely disappearance of Richard Desmond's greatest asset, Anil Bhoyrul, whose Sexpress 'media' section enlivened the Sunday breakfast of many top executives. Fear not; Diary invites readers to find a job for Comical Anil. Those who have followed his progress will agree it would be difficult to top his last one, as Desmond's town crier. Diary has its own list of ideas for Anil: 1. Director of communications for Enron; 2. Unauthorised biographer of Steven Byers; 3. Berlusconi's speechwriter. Anyone interested in recruiting Anil, contact Diary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
