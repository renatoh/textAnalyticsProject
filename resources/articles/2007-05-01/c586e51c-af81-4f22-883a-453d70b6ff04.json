Graeme Hick was also in the runs last weekend, making the 134th century of his career for Worcestershire as they surrendered to Sussex at New Road, but the great white hope of English cricket is now yesterday's man. Sadly for Hick, and for his many supporters, who included several England captains, only six of his hundreds came in Tests. Pietersen has already exceeded that total, with eight in two years. He has taken to the international stage with an assurance that proved beyond the resources of his predecessor, who is essentially a shy man. Hick's modesty made him countless friends within the dressing room (unlike Pietersen) but his gentle manner didn't help him to carry his county form towards those exposed peaks where the batsman stands alone. Like Pietersen, Hick came to this country to forge a professional career, though there too their roads diverge. Hick came as a teenager from Zimbabwe, who did not have Test status, and immediately found a welcoming home by the Severn, where he has put down firm roots and where he will probably remain for the rest of his days. Pietersen, being South African, had access to a Test career but preferred to become English, moving at Clive Rice's bidding to Nottinghamshire and then, to general relief at Trent Bridge, joining Hampshire. One man values restraint; the other is a show pony, with the rosettes to prove it. It is hard to imagine Hick leaping on a batting partner as Pietersen leapt upon Michael Vaughan when the England captain completed his century last Friday. But then Pietersen clearly imagines he is \"the skipper's mate\" (he isn't, actually) just as he was \"Goughy's mate\" when his English papers came through, and he is \"Warney's mate\" at Southampton. Though it makes an unconvincing spectacle - this \"can I be your best friend?\" business - it cannot be denied that \"KP\" is a very fine attacking batsman. The fact that he is not English, and will never be accepted as an Englishman by most of the people who follow the game, either here or in South Africa, doesn't bother him in the slightest. He is well established on the course he charted when he came to these shores, to the extent that he has found himself a pop star fianc\u00e9e, and in the celebrity bran tub of modern sport what could be more resoundingly English than that? Hick was, and remains, a player with a different temperament. It would be wrong to say he didn't want to become a high-class Test performer. He did, but he was reluctant to push himself forward. Right to the end Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain hoped that their patronage as England captains would liberate him, that somehow each recall to the team would make it less difficult, but it became harder. When he finally took his leave in Sri Lanka six years ago, after 65 Tests, it was as a much diminished figure. His Test average of 31 was 21 runs light of his career performance. Happily, he still finds joy in playing county cricket, which is good for all who watch it. It is now 19 summers since he made his name, with that innings of 405 not out against Somerset at Taunton, 19 runs short of AC MacLaren's then record championship score, for Lancashire on the same ground in 1895. Worcestershire were county champions in 1988, and the next year, and it appeared that Hick was destined to join the immortals. But precious few are called, in any age, and we are all wiser now. At the age of 41 he is flying the flag for the golden oldies. Until recently it seemed that every county had a forty-something in their ranks, and not all of them were wheezing and panting. Hick is now on his own and, as he showed last week, he is doing the pear county proud. As they have lost four of their first five matches he may have to do quite a lot of batting this summer. For all his disappointments one can hardly say that Hick has not left a significant mark on the game. Only seven batsmen have made more centuries, and only 15 have scored more heavily throughout a career: another 64 runs and he will become the 16th man to make 40,000. Nor has he ever done anything cheap or tacky. He deserves every commendation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
