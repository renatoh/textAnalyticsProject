He had a can of Coke to wash down copious quantities of lollies and chocolate, and a downbeat mood that left him unwilling to speak with anyone until noon the following day. And now Australia\u2019s top-ranked men\u2019s player has also also discussed how it felt to emerge from the gloom caused by a persistent groin injury, while burdened by a version of the second-year blues that was not just physical but mental for the ATP\u2019s most acclaimed newcomer of 2018. When De Minaur looks back now on his struggles, \u201cdark place\u201d is the go-to term for a player who at Monday night\u2019s Newcombe Medal function was happily back under the bright lights, amid heavy traffic on the blue carpet. Officially in Ash Barty\u2019s shadow as she won the top gong for the third consecutive time. But, really, not. \u201cIt\u2019s been obviously a crazy year, but I\u2019ve been very happy with the effort we\u2019ve been able to put in. Especially [because] it\u2019s been a tough year with injuries and that, so very happy to be standing right now at [world No] 18,\u201d De Minaur told Guardian Australia. \u201cIn tennis you go through stages where there\u2019s lots of ups and downs, but as soon as I was able to get my head in the right place I was able to play the tennis I knew I could.\u201d It took daily help from his trusted Spanish sports psychologist, as well as the support of long-time coach Adolfo Gutierrez. It took a more positive attitude, and better capacity to deal with the heightened pressures and expectations that magnified the disappointments. And it eventually took a healthy-again De Minaur into the top 20, 13 places above where he finished a breakthrough year after soaring from 208th. \u201cIt was definitely much harder. Much harder than I expected. Much harder than you can prepare for,\u201d he said of 2019. \u201cBut that\u2019s what experience does: you sort of deal with it in the moment, and I\u2019ve learnt how to deal with it and I\u2019m looking forward to 2020.\u201d On a night that was so much about Barty, there was also plenty of love in the room for the similarly humble and extraordinarily tenacious De Minaur. John Newcombe was among those to laud the 2018 joint winner of his eponymous medal, who in his follow-up season claimed three ATP 250 hardcourt titles \u2013 including Sydney, while still a teenager \u2013 from five finals. \u201cHe started off the year great, then it took him four or five months to get over all the injury problems and get back on track again, so I admire the way he came back the last half of the year,\u201d said the seven-time major singles champion. \u201cYou can see he\u2019s getting physically stronger, and as that happens he\u2019ll get better and better, so with his attitude and the way he\u2019s going I\u2019d have to be surprised if, this time next year, he\u2019s not in the top 12 and possibly the top 10. I look at the guys outside of the top, say, six, and Alex can mix it with all of them.\u201d To push the very best, though, it is accepted De Minaur will need to add even more heft to his game \u2013 his serve in particular \u2013 and Newcombe heard recently from his old mate Tony Roche of the improvement that was apparent during an impressive unbeaten effort at the new-look Davis Cup finals last month in Madrid. Australia\u2019s quarter-final exit was no fault of De Minaur\u2019s, whose scalps included top-15 duo David Goffin and Denis Shapovalov. Further enhanced weaponry, though, would help \u2013 and De Minaur knows it. Hence the significance of his title win in Atlanta in July when the former junior Wimbledon finalist did not face a single break point. \u201cEspecially to get my confidence back, that was a big boost. I knew I was playing good tennis, but obviously the results weren\u2019t really showing, so to get that under my belt, it really catapulted [me into] the rest of the year.\u201d He took a single week\u2019s holiday at the end of this one, and spent as much of it as possible sleeping \u2013 or \u201cregenerating the batteries\u201d, as he quaintly describes it \u2013 at the family home in the Spanish coastal town of Alicante. With the strength and size he intends to keep building through a pre-season that starts in Melbourne this week will come the power he is seeking, De Minaur believes. \u201cSo that\u2019s a lot of work in the gym. I\u2019ve felt the difference even with my serve, with getting a bit stronger in my core area, so with the hard work you\u2019ll be able to see the improvements.\u201d But not at the expense of his great assets, including the run-down-every-ball foot speed Rafael Nadal considers without peer on the tour. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy balance you want to achieve,\u201d said De Minaur. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go overboard, because you don\u2019t want to minimise one of the best areas of your game, so I\u2019ve just got to be cautious with that. I\u2019ll take it step by step. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be getting too big any time soon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
