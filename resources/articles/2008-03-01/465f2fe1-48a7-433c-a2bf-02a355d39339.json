I suspect they'll have a thrash for 45 minutes or so, assuming they are not bowled out first. Some of you might regard that as unnecessarily defensive - England already lead by 501 after all - but it will at least keep the New Zealand openers guessing, and it might allow Andrew Strauss to get a well-deserved double-century. And there's so much time left in the game that three-quarters of an hour is neither nor there. I also suspect they probably won't win it today, for all the brittleness of the Kiwi batting, because the pitch remains so very good for batting. But so many of my predictions have gone awry in recent weeks that you're probably much better off disregarding all the above. Reading the comments on this site about the centuries for Strauss and Ian Bell, it's curious how interpretation divides neatly down the middle. Half of you are delighted for both players, especially Strauss because he was under more pressure, and have already pencilled in your batting line-ups for the first Test against New Zealand at Lord's on May 15. The other half regard the innings as an irritation that has merely delayed the inevitable (in the case of Strauss) and further proof of flat-track bulliness (in the case of Bell). There might be some truth in both those judgments, but the fact is you can't half it both ways. You can't criticise the batsmen for getting out cheaply in the first innings and then say their hundreds second time round mean nothing. Or perhaps you can... An email! \"Well, well, well, those two knocks have certainly put the cat among the pigeons!\" says Andrew Stroud. \"Hats off to both players - performed well under the pressure to perform, even if the pressure from the match situation was minimal. Straussy's knock may not have been pretty but it was certainly gutsy. Given that Sidey was plucked from the forgotten backwaters of county cricket, who do you think will be the batting stalwart who surprises us all in the summer, when he comes in to the side from the county set-up? Has Stuart Law qualified yet?\" I'd be surprised if an old'un comes in next (Ramprakash is regarded as too close to 40 to make a return). Watch out for Kent's Joe Denly and Hampshire's Michael Carberry. But surely ahead of them in the queue are Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara. Forget Robert Key. The weather: There's a bit more cloud cover than there was yesterday. You've got to say that England have had by far the best of the conditions in this Test: sunshine for days one and three, when they were batting, and lots of clouds for day, when they were bowling. Beefy says the English bowlers have been swinging it during their practice session out in the middle this morning and Bumble says he expects England to \"steamroller\" it. In other words, they can't possibly mess one up, can they. Gary Naylor dept: \"If it's cloudy, Vaughan really should declare,\" he says. \"Batting through swinging conditions to declare as the sun comes out would be wasteful. PS Is grated mozzarella the best thing since sliced bread?\" Another email! \"Thank goodness Strauss has got a decent score at last and (probably) nailed his place for the summer,\" says Harkarn Sumal. \"With KP being such a self-centred egomaniac, Cook being three consistent years from readiness (age and experience-wise) and no one else putting their hands up, let's hope that Strauss can pull himself together and at last give the selectors an alternative to Vaughan for the captaincy. Having (with hindsight, foolishly) bowed to the cult of Flintoff and handed him the captaincy before the Ashes in 2006/07 despite Strauss showing such aptitude against Pakistan that summer, they pretty much ruined Strauss and Flintoff in one fell swoop, and demolished any sensible line of succession at the same time. Vaughan's place in the batting line-up is under far less pressure than it should be, simply because of a lack of a viable captaincy alternative. So come on Straussy, rack 'em up this summer son.\" Strauss dept: Before this innings, he had never made more than 147 in a Test. Now he's 27 runs away from a double-century. And did you know that the highest score by an England batsman since Graham Gooch's 333 against India at Lord's in 1990 is Kevin Pietersen's 226 against West Indies at Headingley last summer? If Strauss really goes berserk this morning... More on Strauss: \"What no one seems to give enough credit to is the massive element of luck in this funny old game,\" says Bernard Hughes. \"In the first innings Strauss played a bad shot, no question, and he deserved to be out. But on another day it would have gone in the gap for four, everyone would have forgotten it, and he may have gone on to get 70 or whatever. On Saturday he sliced an ugly shot about a foot over slip's head and got away with it, and now he's got 173*. Cricket's a game of millimetres and so much gets rests on so little. Let Straussy enjoy his moment, rubbish bowling or not.\" 123rd over: England 421-5 (Strauss 176, Ambrose 30) So, here we go. Daniel Vettori opens the bowling and Strauss tucks his first ball into the leg-side for a single. Tim Ambrose returns the strike immediately with a dab into the covers and Strauss does likewise, nudging wide of short fine leg. Ambrose works the fifth ball to midwicket for one more and Strauss equals his highest first-class score with the fifth single of the over, a cut to deep cover. \"Interesting point about second-innings runs,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Where second-innings wickets are often cheap (Chris Tremlett's record has plenty), there seem to be few cheap second-innings runs - \"getting on with it\" in Test-match conditions is never easy. For two sessions yesterday, Harmy's pal's oft-stated, \"Add two wickits to t'score\" was in play, so I'm happy to give full value to Strauss and Bell. They'll need to back these efforts up with solid series at home to NZ - if they do, they're in for Summer 2009, as we can't be tampering with the team in the run-up to that little clash. The selectors' faith is repaid and I'll have to learn a little patience.\" WICKET! Strauss c Bell b Patel 177 (424-6) There'll be no double-century, but so what? Strauss perishes on the charge, launching Jeetan Patel towards deep extra cover, where Matthew Bell clings on ahead of his fourth duck in five innings. \"Yay, some potentially non-depressing cricket coverage to comfort me as I slog through some unwanted writing,\" says Thom Rath. \"Whatever happened to Key anyways? I have been ensconced abroad and have not seen him play for a few years.\" He's been scoring a few runs for Kent - but not enough to force his way back in. 124th over: England 424-6 (Ambrose 31, Broad 0) Quick runs, please. It's cloudy. WICKET! Ambrose c and b Vettori 31 (425-7) Ambrose gets a leading edge as he tries to work Vettori to leg and the bowler clings on with both hands high to his left. McCullum chuckles. 125th over: England 429-7 (Broad 2, Sidebottom 3) The longer England stay out there, the happier New Zealand will be. If Strauss were still there, giving it a whack, I could just about understand the logic. But we're now down to the tail and the sun is in danger of breaking through. And a few quick wickets are hardly going to damage New Zealand morale, are they? \"This email is a day late, so apologies,\" says David Horn. \"I remember an email on the OBO last year (or before), from an Aussie who observed that English batsmen were specialists at producing innings good enough to keep their place in the team, but not good enough to turn or win a match. I was wondering if we could conveniently pigeon hole either of yesterday's efforts in this way. Strauss's innings won't have won us the match (assuming we do win) - 5 efforts of 40+ would have probably got us enough runs - and the same goes for Bell. Delighted though I am for both of them, all they've done is claimed their place, rather than won the match. Had either of them done this in the first innings it might be different, but they didn't. Sidebottom has put us in a winning position - all Strauss and Bell have done is consolidated. Discuss.\" 126th over: England 432-7 (Broad 5, Sidebottom 3) Broad increases the lead to 516 with a thick edge for two to third man off Patel, and it is surely time to stick the Kiwis in. But no: Broad pushes a single to long-on, before Sidebottom misses a heave. \"If you can grate something called Mozzarella, it isn't!\" says Sunil X. 127th over: England 435-7 (Broad 8, Sidebottom 3) Hmm. This all feels bit unnecessary, but it probably won't make any difference at all: England ought to win this at a canter, even if they delayed the declaration until lunch (wickets notwithstanding). Broad paddle-sweeps Vettori for two, then smacks him to deep cover for a single. \"Broad is batting instead of bowling! Ridiculous,\" exclaims Gary Naylor. \"Well played Strauss: out trying to hit a six.\" 128th over: England 441-7 (Broad 12, Sidebottom 5) We'll get 'em in singles. A great ploy at this stage of the game. Four pushes for one are followed by an attempt by Broad to launch Patel out of the ground: he collects two to long-on. \"Can I be in both camps on the Strauss question?\" says Alfred Moore. \"I'm happy for him. I really am. But it'll take more than a big hundred to change my opinion. It would be very unfair to judge a player on one innings because the innings to judge him by would be selected according to a prior judgement. For instance, I would select innings one of this series. Or three. Or five. Or four. Or two. Others would select innings six. That's why we have averages. One great score on a flat track against crap bowling doesn't make him more than a mediocre batsman, and if England are happy with that, then good for them, but they'll never challenge Australia. Or India, for that matter. Or Sri Lanka.\" 129th over: England 448-7 (Broad 17, Sidebottom 7) There is a surreal feeling about proceedings at the moment: what is happening now is entirely irrelevant to what will happen later. Broad's cover-drive for four off Vettori is all well and good, but a touch hollow in the circumstances. \"Sunil will find that there are different kinds of mozarella,\" says Andrew Stroud. \"The harder, yellower version can indeed be grated - and isn't often found sold in blocks over here, whereas the mozarella he is probably thinking of is of the buffalo variety, which would be torn rather than grated I presume.\" 130th over: England 453-7 (Broad 21, Sidebottom 8) I guess at least we're seeing a reminder that Broad can make the No8 slot his own: that's a lovely lofted off-drive for four off Patel. \"I fear that England will lose their psychological advantage of yesterday now,\" says Clare Davies. \"The last wickets will go in just a few overs, and despite the size of the lead, and almost two full days to bowl out the Black Caps, their spirits will be dulled by the losses. It's going to be a draw.\" I think not. 131st over: England 456-7 (Broad 21, Sidebottom 11) Phew, the game might turned full circle there if Sidebottom had been run out by Patel's throw from the covers. Instead, he misses and England pinch a second on the overthrow that might yet prove crucial in the final analysis. \"If I were Vettori, I'd have Martin and Southee on with instructions to bowl high full tosses at Broad's and Sidebottom's right hands,\" says the deeply unsporting Gary Naylor. \"If they break a finger, it's Vaughan's fault.\" 131.5 overs: England 467-7dec (Broad 31, Sidebottom 12) Beefy enters the commentary box and - needless to say - he's fuming. \"I just don't understand what's going on out there,\" he says, sounding worryingly like Fred Trueman. Broad can't hear him though, and steps away to loft Patel over extra-cover for four, then heaves him over long-on for six. And that's the declaration, which Beefy will be pleased about. New Zealand will need 1,764 to win - or possibly 553. And England have well over five and a half sessions in which to take nine wickets, plus that of Matthew Bell. Here, meanwhile, is Andrew Stroud. \"Re David Horn - yes and no. Sidey undoubtedly got us back into the game, but then the batsmen had to step up to get us into a position to bowl out NZ again with a bit less than 2 days of the game to go. And it is undoubtedly a good thing that both Strauss &amp; Bell went on to convert their 40+ scores to something bigger. So in other words, a team effort!\" Strauss/Bell: \"Not 'match-winning' innings as such, but 'victory-setting-up' ones no doubt,\" says Lev Parikian. \"A repeat of their first innings efforts would have left us at 13-3 or so, and then where would we have been, as Peter's wolf-fearing grandfather said...\" Absolutely. Someone had to score the runs to set up England's domination. And if it hadn't been Strauss or Bell, you can be sure we would all now be calling for their heads on a plate with an apple in the mouth. And Sidebottom: \"Sidebottom has the prospect of taking 30 wickets in a three-match series,\" points out John Starbuck. \"Has this ever been done before? Also, Gary Naylor didn't get it quire right: grated mozzarella is the best thing ON sliced bread, toasted.\" 1st over: New Zealand (needing 553) 2-0 (How 2, Bell 0) Jamie How takes first strike, which at least delays Bell's pair - and his fourth duck in five innings - for a moment, but there's early swing for Sidebottom into the right-hander: English lips are licked. The first four balls are defended resolutely, but the fifth is left alone - and it's not all that far away from off-stump. The sixth is flicked into the leg-side for two. \"The most costly variety of Mozzarella is indeed made from buffalo milk in Italy, but it is equally acceptable made from cow's milk,\" says Sunil X. \"It's just that it is by nature fresh, soft and sold in tubs of water. The other stuff may be called Mozzarella, but it isn't, any more than the stuff made in Wisconsin called Parmesan is Parmesan...\" 2nd over: New Zealand (needing 553) 2-0 (How 2, Bell 0) Jimmy Anderson has some making-up to do after his first-innings profligacy and who better to do it with than poor old Matthew Bell, the walking wicket's walking wicket? He's beaten second ball and is squared up by the third. I guess he'll just be grateful he isn't facing Sidebottom. Having said that, Anderson beats him again with the last ball, a good'un. And a maiden. \"I think tonight that it behoves me to be the Cassandra of doom (a tautology I write deliberately),\" says Clare Davies. \"Were I to gleefully celebrate the position England is in now, it would undoubtedly cause harm to befall our boys. Think I'll carry on in gloom for now.\" 3rd over: New Zealand (needing 553) 5-0 (How 5, Bell 0) How tucks Sidebottom to deep backward square for two and Beefy is a little concerned that humidity levels are starting to drop as the sun comes out. Now, this is interesting: Sidebottom is going round the wicket very early on. He used the tactic to have How caught at slip during the miracle spell on day two, and this will keep the batsman on his toes, especially when Sidebottom swings ball to within touching distance of off-stump as How shoulders arms. The last ball brings a single off a very thick inside edge which How didn't know much about as he lunged forward. Sidebottom does look dangerous from that angle. \"Come on now, Lawrence, surely you're tempting fate by dismissing Matthew Bell so easily?\" writes, er, Matthew Bell. Nah, he's rubbish. 4th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 6-0 (How 6, Bell 0) How tucks Anderson to deep backward square for one more - he scores almost exclusively with the tuck and the pull, but England have sensibly given him nothing short as yet. Anderson then goes up for lbw against Bell, who is trapped on the crease, but that might have been a touch high. \"Three-match series,\" says Lev Parikian. \"35 Lohmann, 34 Barnes, 33 Hadlee Cheese: the yellow mozzarella is an affront to the taste buds. Personal opinion of course, but I am, like Harmy's pal, right.\" 5th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 6-0 (How 6, Bell 0) Sidebottom stays round the wicket to How, who is covering up well outside off-stump. He's determined not to give it away on the drive like he did in the first innings. With Bell strokeless at the other end, this could make for a soporific passage of play. As bus conductors almost used to say: wickets, please. A maiden. \"After all the talk of Strauss fighting for his place, attention should now turn to Jimmy,\" says Ben Shepherd, brandishing a burning torch. \"Unless he bowls very well here Monty, Sideshow, Broad and Hoggard will be the attack at Lord's.\" You lot are like vultures. 6th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 14-0 (How 6, Bell 8) Bell is yet to face a delivery from Sidebottom, for which he will be thankful. But Anderson is not exactly donating him runs either and he has to rely on a streaky edge over the slips for four to get off the mark. There are a few cheers in the crowd which sound more ironic than genuine, but, well, the ball was short and wide and at least he trusted himself to go for it. And then he rams my words down my throat with a square-cut for four. A dismal ball. \"Tell Sunil X that while the finest, traditionally may come from Italy, ex-Formula 1 World Champion Jody Scheckter is turning out some pretty decent stuff from his organic farm at Laverstoke,\" says Clare Davies. \"Very tasty.\" 7th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 16-0 (How 7, Bell 9) How drops Sidebottom into the off-side for a quick single, which means he could have four deliveries at Bell. He goes back over the wicket to him, remembering perhaps the lbw in the first innings, then goes round the wicket again for the last ball of the over, which Bell drops into the off-side to keep the strike. \"Funny how a different narrative can be applied to the same plot depending on who the protagonists are,\" says Simon West. \"If, say, Australia had found themselves three down for four and then recovered to declare their second innings, setting the opposition 550 to win, it would be \"Typical ruthless Aussies; never out of the game; always find someone to turn it around if the top order struggle etc. etc.\" Whereas, when it's England, it's \"They were lucky the opposition were so crappy; the score doesn't reflect how weak their batting was etc. etc.\" My take? Hats off to a team that's come back from 1-0 down to win a three-match series, with brave team selections, determined batting under extreme pressure and an historic bowling performance from one of the world's best swing bowlers.\" 8th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 20-0 (How 7, Bell 13) Anderson goes in search of the yorker, but Bell is waiting for him and tucks him through square-leg for four: shot! There's not a lot of swing out there for Anderson, so that's going to put an onus on patience, a quality he doesn't always seem to possess. \"Congratulations to this pair for putting together the highest opening partnership of this Test,\" says James Hobbs. 9th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 20-0 (How 7, Bell 13) How edges Sidebottom, still operating round the wicket, just in front of Paul Collingwood at second slip, but I have the feeling these Kiwis are not going to be as supine as they were in the first innings. But then they could hardly be more supine. A maiden. \"Sunil X and I agree on something!\" exclaims Gary Naylor. \"Bufala Mozzarella is indeed much the superior variety - one feels like a latter day Caligula, tearing it before consuming with bread and olive-oil-soaked tomatoes and avocado. My problem is that such slightly erotic gastronomic delights are denied to us vegetarians unless we track down a ball of Bufala made with non-animal rennet - not even Waitrose do those.\" 10th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 37-0 (How 7, Bell 30) Bell collects four more off Anderson with a fend to third man for four, but it was still too short from the bowler, who has lapsed very quickly back into infuriating mould after bowling so well at Wellington. And there's four more - a convincing back-foot push through the covers as Anderson drops short and offers width. And the next ball is cut behind point for four. The fifth ball is slashed for four more! Bell is destroying Anderson, which is not a sentence I ever thought I'd write, and then nicks the strike. Well batted Bell; inexcusable drivel from Anderson. 11th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 39-0 (How 7, Bell 32) Well, well. Bell is starting to play with some confidence here, and for that we can thank Anderson (5-1-30-0 in this innings and 12-2-84-0 in the match). He pushes Sidebottom on the up through mid-on for two and New Zealand have made a spirited start to their attempts to save the series. \"Grated mozzarella - and indeed, all grated cheese in packets - is the devil's work,\" says Sarah Bacon. \"It contains an anti-caking agent so the bits won't clump together and look unsightly, but I feel sure it'll be proved to be cancer-causing in the not-too-distant. Use a grater, you lazy sods.\" 12th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 40-0 (How 7, Bell 32) Broad replaces Anderson, who has had a miserable Test so far, and How takes a leg-side leg-bye. He's giving Bell the bowling! Who would have thought it? Bell ducks under a Broad bouncer and what will England think if they fail to take a wicket before lunch? They might regard this session as a waste of time. \"Vegetarian?\" scoffs Mark Downing. \"No wonder Naylor is up all night...\" 13th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 42-0 (How 9, Bell 32) A double change as Monty Panesar replaces Sidebottom (6-2-9-0), and he very nearly yorks How first ball. Vaughan must be furious that Anderson has allowed Bell to rediscover some of the confidence that ebbed away during his first five innings of the series. Two off the over: a tuck by How to fine-leg. 14th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 44-0 (How 10, Bell 32) Broad has settled into a better line and length than Anderson. Is that a surprise? Not really. How tucks him to midwicket for a single and Stephen Fleming will be thrilled that these two are taking the shine off the ball before he goes in search of the 50-odd runs he needs to finish with a Test average of 40. \"Thanks Sunil,\" says Pat Nagle. \"Have just Googled \"Parmesan\" and \"Wisconsin\" expecting to get zero hits. Not 409,000. Don't leave us in suspense. What's it like? Does it smell of sick like the real thing?\" 15th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 44-0 (How 10, Bell 32) Panesar beats How outside off with one that turns. He'll like the look of that. A good maiden. \"How can a Toffee-supporting vegetarian such as Mr Naylor have any appreciation of proper cheese, particularly Bufalla mozzarell', any more than he can be expected to have a proper appreciation of football or any other serious matter,\" asks Lou Roper. \"Will he drop his 'favourite' Strauss now?\" 16th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 45-0 (How 10, Bell 33) If nothing else, this session will remind England that they are going to have to work for their wickets, and that is no bad thing. The pitch is still flat as another four-letter word beginning with 'f' (no, not that one) and there isn't a great deal of swing. That was a good Broad over to Bell, although there was a huge shout for lbw last ball: it might just have hit him outside the line of off-stump. \"Which of the OBO staff is vegan?\" asks Sunil X. I think you know the answer to that one. Mr Ingle, we salute you. 17th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 48-0 (How 11, Bell 35) That was a really good shout from Broad: it was definitely pad before bat, but Koertzen expressed his lack of interest pretty quickly. In the meantime, the batsmen exchange leg-side singles off Panesar, before Bell nicks the strike. He's playing with increasing confidence. 18th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 48-0 (How 11, Bell 35) Bell is getting stuck in here, which is two large fingers to my rather mean assessment of him earlier. A Broad maiden, and we'll have one more over before lunch. \"Having just availed myself of your most recent commentary,\" says Burton, \"I must say that I am extremely angry. Gruy\u00e8re is the queen of toast-cheese, and any man who disagrees is an obvious plant, in the pay of Big Calcium. Surely the Guardian has more nous than to succumb to such obvious, partisan spin. An Outrage.\" 19th over: New Zealand (needing 553) 48-0 (How 11, Bell 35) A maiden from Panesar to How. That's lunch and it's been New Zealand's session: they were happy to wait around in the field while Vaughan extended England's second innings ad nauseam and have now weathered a disappointingly tame new-ball storm (Anderson, hold your head in shame). There are still five sessions to go, but at least the openers are spreading the word that New Zealand can fight for their lives. Join me at 12.10am GMT to see if England can make the breakthrough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
