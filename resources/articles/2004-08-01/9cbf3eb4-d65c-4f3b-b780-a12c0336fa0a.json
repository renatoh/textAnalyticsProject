The reason? \"I have discovered how great using an ice bath can be,\" Lewis-Francis said last night, describing how he has plunged enthusiastically into a new aid to physical preparation as one of three members of the 100 metres squad who have spent the past eight days at the British holding camp in Cyprus. He explained: \"My last race was at Crystal Palace, where I did not run well. At the time I said I was suffering from the hot conditions, but it is not the same out here. \"That was a nasty, sticky night in London but in Cyprus it has not been as warm as I thought and I have felt good. I have no worries about adapting to the conditions once we land in Athens because training and preparation have gone well - and I have discovered the plus points of jumping into an ice bath. \"There were three bins at the stadium where we trained and they were filled with ice. It is something I have never done before and I always thought I would never do. \"We have ice baths available at the high-performance centre in Birmingham where I train, but if I want to feel cold normally I can stand outside for two minutes. \"Not here. At first it was a horrible, disgusting feeling getting into the bath. I did not know what to do with myself because it was so cold. I was in there for a few minutes until the ice melted but I have found how effective it can be. \"I know many of my fellow athletes use them and I have to say that the next morning when I woke, I was feeling great. The feeling in my legs was tremendous. I was really refreshed. \"I thought to myself, though, I'm not going to suffer alone - my mum always told me to share things - so when the others were in there, I made sure I put extra ice in to make it even colder. \"It was all a bit of fun but hopefully when I get to the start line I'll feel the effects even more. \"I am so excited about what is ahead. I cannot believe I am going to be part of the Olympic Games. It really hit me on Friday night. \"I have had a fantastic experience with the team in Cyprus, training, acclimatising and enjoying being with fellow athletes at a camp for the first time. \"As a junior I went on trips but this experience is all new to me. On Friday, when the opening ceremony was taking place in Athens, we had our own special celebration in our hotel and it was such a memorable occasion. Denise Lewis walked through the hotel carrying a flag and Team GB followed. We were walking in two by two and we were applauded by the people in the hotel. It was very emotional and it was such an honourable thing for them to clap us. \"Audley Harrison was there with us and Team GB went to the hotel's harbour area where two giant screens were up to watch the opening ceremony. \"That was when realisation struck. In the past I have always watched the opening ceremony from home. Now I am here, and this week I am going to be part of the Olympics. \"Am I confident? I am always confident because I do not want to run just to be part of the occasion. I am happy with the way the preparation has gone - now for the real thing.\" For Mark Lewis-Francis, the real thing begins on Saturday with the 100m heats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
