The quarter-final promises to be an exciting encounter between two of the form sides of the tournament. Both teams are unbeaten so far, Greg Ryan's side having won two and drawn one of their group matches and Powell's having won one and drawn two. The US, ranked No1 in the world, will be keen to keep alive their hopes of a third World Cup title but England will want to enhance their credentials as one of the world's major sides. \"The USA are a great side,\" Powell said. \"They have been world and Olympic champions and we have to respect these facts. They are undoubtedly the favourites but we believe we can do it.\" England will hope Kelly Smith maintains her goalscoring prowess tomorrow. The Arsenal striker is joint top scorer in the World Cup with four goals, alongside Germany's Birgit Prinz and Brazil's Marta. Ryan said Smith was one of the players the US had to be wary of. \"England represent a real challenge to us. They're mobile, a good smart team, and have some star-quality players. Kelly Smith is a key attacking player for them but they have some other very good individuals as well.\" Th US have scored five goals in three games, but have missed dozens of other chances. Ryan said: \"The main thing for us is to continue creating our chances knowing at some point they just start falling.\" Brazil reached the quarter-finals, where they will meet Australia, by beating Denmark 1-0 in Group D in Hangzhou yesterday, eliminating the Danes from the tournament. With Marta dictating the play, Brazil dominated their opponents but failed to take their chances and did not secure victory until injury-time when the substitute Pretinha raced on to a through-ball and lifted it over the onrushing Danish goalkeeper Heidi Johansen. The pro-Brazil crowd at the Hangzhou Dragon Stadium oohed and aahed each time Marta touched the ball, and she did not disappoint, launching passes around the field and dribbling past defenders. She hit a post in the first half and her best chance came with 20 minutes left when she exchanged passes with a team-mate and cracked a low shot which Johansen tipped around her post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
