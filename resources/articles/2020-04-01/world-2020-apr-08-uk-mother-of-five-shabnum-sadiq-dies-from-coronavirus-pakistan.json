Shabnum Sadiq, 39, a Labour councillor, died after spending 24 days on a ventilator in Pakistan. She had travelled there for a wedding in early March. She contracted the disease five days after arriving in the country and died on Monday. In June 2006 Sadiq, who already had a six-year-old daughter, Shireen, gave birth to quadruplets naturally. She had been given a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and had feared that she would not be able to have more children. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d said Haqeeq Dar, a colleague on Slough borough council. \u201cShe only went on a short eight-day trip. But she never came back. I just can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s gone.\u201d A spokesman for the local authority said it was flying flags at half mast at council offices in tribute to Sadiq. James Swindlehurst, leader of the council, said: \u201cThis is very shocking for all of us and our thoughts are with her family and friends. We worked together closely and personally I will miss her very deeply.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a significant loss for the council and the town but is nothing compared to the loss her family, close friends and community are feeling right now.\u201d Sadiq was elected to Wexham Lea ward in May 2016 and served on various council committees. She was a former lead member for education and children\u2019s services. Swindlehurst said: \u201cThis has brought home to us that not only is this virus something we have to deal with as a town but also personally; through our work, through our actions and through our grief for those it has taken. \u201cBehind every statistic about this virus is a family ripped apart and there is no starker example of that, to us in the council, than to lose one our colleagues.\u201d Madhuri Bedi, the councillor for Foxborough ward, said she was feeling \u201cimmense heartbreak\u201d for \u201cher, her children, her husband and loved ones\u201d. She said: \u201cShe was a young woman with huge determination, bringing up her daughter and her quadruplets with ease.\u201d Iftakhar Ahmed, chairman of Wexham Court parish council, said Sadiq \u201cwas known for her kind and caring personality\u201d. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends, may God give them patience to endure this tragic loss of life,\u201d he said. \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
