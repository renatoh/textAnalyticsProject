The \"screener ban\" was imposed by the major studios' lobby group the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) but opposed by smaller studios who said it crushed their films' chances of winning awards, especially Oscars. At a hearing today, district judge Michael Mukasey granted a temporary restraining order against the ban. He said he had been persuaded by testimony from independent producers that the ban threatened their revenues. The MPAA has said it will appeal against the judge's decision, reiterating that it sees the ban as an essential part of the fight against piracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
