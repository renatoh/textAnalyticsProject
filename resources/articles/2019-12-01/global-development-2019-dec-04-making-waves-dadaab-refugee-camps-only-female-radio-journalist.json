This makeshift studio is home to the only radio station in Kenya\u2019s Dadaab refugee camp. Broadcasting a Somali-language programme, Gargaar FM (the name means assistance in Somali) provides vital information to more than 200,000 people who call Dadaab home, and serves as a source of entertainment and psychosocial support for refugees trapped in the isolated camp, first established in 1991. Today Ahmed is going to be talking about the importance of breastfeeding. \u201cSo many people call in when we discuss such topics, most are women because subjects like breastfeeding exclusively affects them.\u201d The thirst for information has never been greater here. Kenya announced the closure of the complex about three years ago, so residents live with the uncertainty of the camp\u2019s future and the threat of returning to the conflict in Somalia. Feeling cut off from the rest of Kenya and east Africa, refugees in Dadaab cling to their radios to keep up with local and regional news. \u201cGargaar FM station has been one of the most effective mediums in communicating with refugees in Dadaab,\u201d says Assadullah Nasrullah at UNHCR\u2019s Dadaab office. \u201cIt helps disseminate important messages to the refugee population on healthcare, education, voluntary repatriation, registration and other humanitarian programmes.\u201d Gargaar FM also connects people to the outside world via the BBC World Service and Voice of America service. \u201cWe cannot just rely on what the UN and aid organisations tell us, we have to get an independent source of information,\u201d says Fadumo Ahmed, a mother of five who runs a small grocery stall in the camp. \u201cThe imminent closure of the camp has affected everything including our businesses and livelihoods so the radio is important in keeping us up to date on Kenya\u2019s changing political moves.\u201d The station is supported by the UNHCR but run by a group of young journalists who studied and grew up in the sprawling camp. Ahmed was nine when her father was killed in Mogadishu in 2008. She witnessed her pregnant mother\u2019s grief coupled with her desperation at the loss of the family\u2019s breadwinner. They had to flee the country and came to Dadaab to rebuild their lives. \u201cI lost my father, my home town and my school,\u201d recalls Ahmed. \u201cBut I found peace and hope in Dadaab and I immediately enrolled in school.\u201d But opportunities in the camp are limited. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the chance to go to high school after completing my primary education so I enrolled in a one-year after-school youth programme run by the Norwegian Refugee Council where I received basic journalism training,\u201d she says. Almost all of the girls who started the course with her have dropped out or returned to Somalia, making her the only female journalist working in the camp. Her voice on the airwaves has encouraged other girls to apply for internships at the station. \u201cI am now training young girls who just joined us,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIt is also good for me because I would have people that I can rely on and who would support me and fill my position when I am not working.\u201d But not everyone in this conservative community is happy with Ahmed\u2019s work. Some discourage her from doing a \u201cman\u2019s job\u201d and tell her she should get married instead. \u201cI am actually proud of what I do and many people respect me a lot but there are many others who don\u2019t like my career choice. They put on me too much pressure but I just laugh it off when they try to push me into marriage,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a loving mother who supports me and stands by me all the time. She is the only person whose advice I would heed.\u201d She believes her ambition is bigger than the challenges. She wants to go to university and eventually return to Somalia despite being fully aware that it is one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist. \u201c I know how dangerous it is for people like me but I would really like to go back,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother would never allow me to risk my life so I just have to wait in this prison-like camp.\u201d Many here refer to Dadaab as an open prison because of the Kenyan government\u2019s strict encampment policy. For many the lack of identity and freedom of movement is crippling their potential. \u201cIf I apply for training or media workshops in other countries, I would not be able to attend because I don\u2019t have an identity card or passport with which I can travel. This discourages me from actively searching for opportunities outside of Dadaab,\u201d she says. It is a frustration echoed by the young people who make up the bulk of the camp\u2019s population. The radio, therefore, serves as an important connection to the outside world. When Gargaar FM first went on air in 2013, there were about half a million people in Dadaab, more than five times its original capacity. It is now closer to 217,000. But it is the importance of her work that drives Ahmed on, and she produces, edits and presents her own stories and programmes. \u201cIt is a lot of work and there are only a handful of staff here so we have to utilise the limited resources we have in the station,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when you have a whole community depending on you for their information you have to do everything it takes to meet their expectations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
