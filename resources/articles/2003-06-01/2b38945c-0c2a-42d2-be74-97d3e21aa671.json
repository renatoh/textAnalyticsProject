The route follows limestone terraces, in some places still neat, in others crumbling, built by those who scratched subsistence from the poor soil but were later seduced by the promise of easier lives in the United States and South America or at the textile factories set up nearby after the second world war. The path winds between tussocks of coarse pianta alfa grass, once gathered by women and children to be turned into stuffing for soldiers' pillows, the bristles of toothbrushes or ropes that would be hung in the sea to catch mussels. Suddenly the harsh realities of that Basilicata described by Carlo Levi in Christ Stopped At Eboli, the account of his exile there by the Mussolini regime in the 1930s, seemed less remote. Levi's title derived from a feeling among the peasants who inhabited this part of Italy's deep south that they were regarded not as Christians, or human beings, but as beasts of burden. It was the book and Francesco Rosi's rambling, atmospheric film version, that had shaped my preconceptions of the region. My initial impressions were very different. In mid-June, the landscape, though it would dry out later, was greener than I expected, the villages tidier and better cared for. In the village of Terranova in Pollino, where I was to start a walking tour that would finish on the coast, any apprehensions I had harboured about the quality of the cooking were swept away. The immaculate little three-star Hotel Picchio Nero, run by Pino Golia with help from various members of his family, produced a memorable dinner thatincluded home-cured ham, asparagus omelette and ciabotta, a delicious combination of red peppers, tomatoes, egg and sausage. Setting out on the first day's walk from the Lago Duglia in the Pollino National Park, there was a reminder that, only a half-century or so before, few people hereabouts escaped the scourge of malaria. A miasma of biting insects made it impossible to linger by the woodland pool, whose still water was salty and a breeding ground for small turtles. The park's wolves are now protected, though so far only 34 have been counted. One had left its prints in a muddy spot on the trail, just behind those of a deer that it was hunting. In winter, when snow piles up in the high places, the wolves scavenge for food in the villages, as they did not far away in Gagliano, where Levi was confined. Though there now may be more wealth in the region, there are already seeds of an awareness that ancient traditions must not be lost if a nascent rural tourism industry is to fulfil its potential. At a workshop in Terranova, I was captivated by an explanation of the art of making bagpipes, the air bags manufactured by making an incision in the hind leg of a goat's carcass and blowing into it until the skin comes away from the flesh and can be removed in one piece. This is fine walking country, though the heat can be fearsome and the risk of encountering the odd viper makes boots a better option than all-terrain sandals. The higher reaches are mainly bare and crennellated by wind and rain, but further down, there are slopes vivid with a profusion of yellow broom and shady oak forests. Orchids grow along the way and there are perfumed wild strawberries to be picked. At times, so many butterflies floated before my eyes that they became mesmerising. Climbing from Viggianello, where my hotel was a former convent with a 250-year-old wooden door so heavy that brute strength was required to open it, I reached a plateau where each step seemed to stir up the scent of crushed mint and oregano. The itinerary led to the coast at Maratea, on the Gulf of Policastro, where the gap between present-day Basilicata and the once dark, mysterious land of poverty, brigandry and superstition is widest. It was there that Conte Rivetti, an industrialist from Ivrea near Turin, built a home, an elegant hotel and the textile factories that attracted so many workers from the countryside. His thank-you to the town with which he became so enamoured was to commission from a Florentine sculptor the statue of Christ the Redeemer, faced with Carrara marble, which stands on a hilltop far above Maratea, arms outstretched. The hotel built by the count is the elegant Santavenere, just above the shore, which was a popular backdrop for fashion photoshoots in the 1950s. Celebrated guests are said to have included Frank Sinatra, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Walkers on this holiday stay at its stablemate, the Locanda delle Donne Monache, another converted nunnery above the old town centre with its pleasant squares and narrow alleys. The Locanda has an attractive terrace swimming-pool, but there is a shuttle between the two properties for those who prefer to end a sweaty day's hiking by plunging into the sea. From Maratea, it was a four and a half hour walk to my ultimate stop, Acquafredda, whose name was belied by the warmth of the Mediterranean. The route began with a long climb, partly on a quiet road, which only around 40 years before had been a rough track. The way was dotted with occasional chapels where travellers would stop for physical and spiritual refuelling. One contained 16th-century frescoes. I picnicked on the disused threshing floor of an abandoned farm building before beginning the long descent to the Villa Cheta Elite, another gracious hotel, full of antiques, lace and fresh linen, to relax with ice cream and chilled lemonade on a lovely terrace overlooking the sea. After the walk there, past crumbling, deserted homes and parapets ravaged by time and the rooting of wandering cattle, in the close humidity of afternoon with thunder rumbling around, reflections on the past made the luxury of the present seem a precious privilege.
