The London Irish full-back says he is determined to bounce back immediately from what he describes as one of the lowest points in his career. Armitage was one of the leading players in last year's Six Nations, his willingness to run from deep helping England become the top try scorers in the tournament, but he has struggled for form this year after spending three months out of action with a shoulder injury. \"I like to play running rugby but, why I do not know, I found myself kicking the ball in the Six Nations, which is not like me,\" said Armitage. \"No one likes being yanked off the field when they are not injured, especially in an international shirt, and I then had to watch the game against France from home. \"That hit me hard because it meant I was not playing well. My confidence is a little bit broken and I have to pick myself up and it is good to be back at London Irish. We want to get back to the old attacking Irish, holding on to the ball, having a go at teams and having fun. This is where I want to be now, forgetting about England.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
