Staging some matches in the US was always intended from the moment the West Indies won the right to host the 2007 event five years ago. What has changed is the ambition of the International Cricket Council now to foster the game in potentially the world's biggest, most lucrative market. The ICC's executive committee meets here a week on Thursday and is expected to offer overwhelming support for the US to qualify automatically as co-hosts. ICC administrators have been thrilled by the amount of news coverage of the World Cup on the American satellite channel CNN, where presenters are bravely wrestling with reports they barely understand. Andrew Eade, the ICC's global development manager, said: \"If formal acceptance is given to the US hosting matches, then the intention is they would be given automatic entry as co-hosts. We are very hopeful it will be approved. The potential is fantastic.\" The US is expected to stage four matches in 2007, probably at a purpose-built stadium in Florida, where Miami's large West Indian community offers an obvious advantage. Tri- nations series will be staged there as soon as practicable. The US were fifth in the last qualifying tournament - the top three went through - which suggests their presence in the next World Cup would be a natural progression. About 10,000 Americans, largely of Asian and West Indian descent, play cricket in New York, California, Michigan and Florida. The ICC hopes to quadruple that by 2007."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
