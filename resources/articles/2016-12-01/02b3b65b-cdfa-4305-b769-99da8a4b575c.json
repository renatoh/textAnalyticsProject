I am the kind of manager who has been critical of his players when they have won, so after such a bad defeat I thought it better to stay out of the dressing room. \u201cI congratulated my players after the games against Middlesbrough, Everton and Chelsea, because I thought in general we were unlucky. We were the better team but did not win, Leicester was different. Sometimes it is better to leave these situations. I didn\u2019t speak to the team after that game.\u201d Guardiola does not believe his position at the Etihad Stadium is safe. \u201cAnything can happen, our position depends on the results,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t leave, I think we will be better next season, but results have to improve. You have to win immediately. It is the same for all the other managers. \u201cYou know what happens in all the big companies and business in the world. If something doesn\u2019t work you have to find a solution. I have never been sacked, and I feel the people at the club trust me, but the reality is that you have to win games.\u201d City have just four wins from their past 15 games in all competitions, but though Guardiola accepts that the last month has not been easy, he believes some of the margins of defeat have been narrow. \u201cAll I want is for my players to play as they did against Chelsea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was not a long time ago, I saw the game again and we didn\u2019t deserve what happened. We were a yard away from a second goal, we could have gone top of the league and now we are seven points behind. \u201cWe have to cut out some of our mistakes but the main thing in English football is controlling the second ball. Without that you cannot survive. The second goal at Leicester came from a throw-in, the second ball was a goal. \u201cIn many other countries when one guy has the ball at his feet the people know what is going to happen. Here the football is more unpredictable because the ball is in the air more than on the floor. I only needed to see one game to understand English football: Swansea 5 Crystal Palace 4. Nine goals, eight from set pieces. That is English football and I have to adapt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
