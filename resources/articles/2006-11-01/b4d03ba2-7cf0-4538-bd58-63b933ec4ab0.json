The vote follows the rejection of a previous offer in September.

Rupert Jones UBS given $6bn lesson for dismal third quarter UBS, the world's second-largest bank, yesterday saw $6bn (\u00a33.15bn) wiped off its value after reporting a 21% slump in third quarter net profit to Sfr2.2bn (\u00a3900,000). The Swiss-based bank blamed weaker markets in equities and bond trading in early summer for its performance, which fell well below its own forecasts. The shares were 5.1% lower at Sfr74.30 on the SWX exchange, having earlier fallen by 6%. UBS said its net profit compared with Sfr3.15bn in the second quarter of this year and Sfr2.8bn in the third quarter of 2005 but insisted a pick-up in the final quarter put it on track for a record year.
