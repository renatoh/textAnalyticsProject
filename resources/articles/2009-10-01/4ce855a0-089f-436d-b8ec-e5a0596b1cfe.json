Most of the big northern yards seem to think along the same lines, and there have been years when every race on the card has seemed to produce a horse to follow through the winter. This year, though, the Charlie Hall fixture a week on Saturday is not simply a cause for anticipation. There is apprehension, too, after four horses were killed at Wetherby last week, during the track's first meeting after \u00a350,000-worth of remedial work on the racing surface. It is quite possible \u2013 likely, even \u2013 that this was just a miserable coincidence. In statistical terms, horses die with sufficient frequency while racing over jumps that four fatalities at any track in a single afternoon, while unusual, is far from impossible. But this is not any track, it is Wetherby, which has endured so many troubles in recent years that, even if it was just sheer bad luck, last week's events may come to be seen as just another twist in the tailspin. The problems started in 2007 when Wetherby was forced to change its layout because of expansion of the adjacent A1. There has been no lack of money or effort in the attempt to get old and new parts of the track to marry up, yet Ian Ward, Wetherby's head groundsman for 34 years, admitted last week that even though nearly twice as much water has been put on the new sections of track as on the old, it still \"just doesn't seem to have that cushion\". Last week's events were predictably seized upon by the leading animal rights group Animal Aid, which would probably still want racing banned even if the injury rate was zero. Its use of welfare issues to advance an absolutist argument is unscrupulous, to say the least, but it wasted no time in calling for the BHA to \"suspend all further racing at Wetherby until an independent evaluation of the ground can be undertaken by a specialist consultancy\". The BHA's investigation of the deaths, though, has found no obvious link between them, and the Charlie Hall card, on the second afternoon of a two-day meeting, will go ahead as planned. In the absence of any clear evidence to the contrary, it is the right and obvious decision, but hardly an easy one. Should the Charlie Hall card be blighted by another series of fatalities, the BHA will be accused of a dereliction of duty. Conversely, should it pass without incident, do not expect Animal Aid to issue a press release hailing its success. It is a reminder that the only absolute rights and wrongs here are in the black-and-white minds of the fanatics. The BHA has to operate with shades of grey, taking decisions based on weight of evidence and the balance of probabilities and then hoping that bad luck does not intervene. So Wetherby survives for now and so, for that matter, does the second-last on the Old course at Cheltenham, which again claimed a disproportionate number of fallers at the track's latest meeting. Remounting, however, has recently been banned, much to the disgust of Tony McCoy, among others, for all that it seems more likely to spare him a future PR debacle than it is to cost him a winner. All three of these issues have welfare at their heart, and all will have vocal proponents on both sides. If successful governance is about getting the big decisions right, though, Wetherby is the one that really matters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
