Rather unfortunately, the sole content of your extrasensory quest is a series of tawdry, spot-the-difference and find-the-object puzzles. Presented with a cluttered illustration, you use the Wii remote as a magnifying glass to identify a list of objects that include things as random as a hand axe, a viking hat, carrots, pliers, Excalibur, a flamingo, antennae and a palm tree. While the puzzles are inoffensive enough, their complete dislocation from the plot or action means the psychic investigations are virtually irrelevant. Cate could just as well be a pet detective or long-haul pilot or teapot salesmen for all the impact it would have on the game's single, rather dull mobile phone game-style trick.
