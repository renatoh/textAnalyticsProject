Do not read on if you haven't seen episode four \u2013 and if you have seen further in the series, please be aware that many UK viewers will not have done. Paul Owen's episode three blog A bit of a disappointing episode of Curb your Enthusiasm this week. The main storyline revolved around Larry dating the hostess of one of his favourite restaurants \u2013 or \"shitting where he eats\", as he charmlessly put it. A subsidiary plot about Larry's office neighbour \"Big Dog\" using up too much of his cupboard space was unfortunately about as interesting as it sounds. Better was Larry's frustration at his assistant Antoinette (Antoinette Spolar) taking a seemingly open-ended period of time off because her father was dying \u2013 although he is in fact, in Larry's words, \"kind of, you know, lingering\". It was obvious what would happen once Larry insisted Antoinette come back to work for just one day, but her tearful breaking of the sad news \u2013 \"My dad just died. The last thing he said was: 'Where's Antoinette?'\" \u2013 was satisfyingly awful. There was some funny, natural-seeming banter between Larry and Richard Lewis when the hostess, Heidi (Rebecca Creskoff), appeared and gave Larry a kiss. \"What the hell just happened here? Am I dreaming?\" asked Lewis. Such moments of improvisation, when you can tell the cast are really enjoying themselves, are always one of the highlights of Curb. But the show is still missing Cheryl, Larry's ex-wife who sadly does not seem to be coming back. It was a relief to have one charming, likeable character to set against Jeff, Susie, Lewis, Leon and almost every other person Larry encounters. And while the single Larry often gets into amusing scrapes, the married Larry was a more interesting character, in my view. Best line: \"I'd love to fire Antoinette and hire her mom,\" Larry ruefully mused, \"but no one could pull that off; it's impossible.\" Best ruthless and unsentimental excuse for not coming to dinner: \"Things aren't so great with Susie and I right now.\" \u2013 Jeff. Larry in the right: Larry was surely entitled to ask Heidi to pay him back the $60 he'd lent her, and Big Dog certainly should not have stolen all those cupboards. \"You stuffed me into one cabinet!\" Larry wailed. Larry in the wrong: \"Ah!\" is not the right response when someone tells you their father has died, no matter how long ago it was. A new low, even for you, Larry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
