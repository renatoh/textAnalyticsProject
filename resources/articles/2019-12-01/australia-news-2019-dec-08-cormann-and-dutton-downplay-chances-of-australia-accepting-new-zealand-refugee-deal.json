Mathias Cormann reiterated on Sunday that the government had made no deal with Lambie in exchange for her support in repealing the medevac laws earlier this week. Lambie said previously she chose to support the government after it agreed to an \u201coutcome\u201d following prolonged negotiations. Lambie has refused to lay out the terms of the deal, citing national security concerns, but told parliament: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked to an outcome I believe we both want \u2026 I am more than satisfied that the conditions are now in place to allow medevac to be repealed.\u201d The government insists it has struck no deal. Cormann appeared on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday and was asked repeatedly if the government was examining the New Zealand resettlement option as part of Lambie\u2019s proposal, a policy it had previously rejected. \u201cIt\u2019s current government policy to resettle people from Nauru and to resettle as many as possible,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cIt is currently the government\u2019s position, as it has been all the way through, to resettle people on Nauru [in a way] that doesn\u2019t give the people, the green light to people smugglers. That doesn\u2019t start people coming to Australia again. We\u2019re totally focused on resettling people to the United States. \u201cThese were arrangements that were severely undermined by Labor\u2019s bad medevac laws and, indeed, that is our focus now.\u201d New Zealand citizens are entitled to travel to Australia without a visa, which the government claims would offer any Manus Island or Nauru refugees settled in the country an option of settling in Australia, which it has explicitly ruled out. The Morrison government has previously suggested it was looking at closing what it terms a \u201cbackdoor\u201d entry to Australia, which would create a two-tier system for New Zealand passport holders. Last week, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said any restrictions would be a domestic matter for Australia. Cormann repeatedly avoided directly answering questions about the New Zealand option, or why the government was being so secretive about an arrangement. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for classified information and the reason some information is classified is to protect our national security and we, as the government, took Senator Lambie into our confidence and provided her with classified information,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cOf course, she\u2019s not then at liberty to divulge that classified information. We\u2019re very grateful to Senator Lambie she\u2019s respected the nature of the information she\u2019s been provided because to do otherwise would be putting Australia\u2019s national security and border protection at risk.\u201d The Obama administration agreed to take up to 1,200 refugees from Australia\u2019s two off-shore detention centres, under a deal struck with the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Australia was expected to resettle between 20 and 50 Central American refugees. Donald Trump honoured the agreement, despite calling it a \u201cdumb deal\u201d in a terse phone conversation with Turnbull shortly after winning the US election. Peter Dutton told Sky News on Sunday the US offer was \u201cthe most realistic\u201d the government had looked at and anything else was providing \u201cammunition\u201d to people smugglers. \u201cThe threat from Sri Lanka and elsewhere is still a very real one,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople smugglers are marketing New Zealand as a destination. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people who have gone from Nauru to the United States who are messaging back now saying, \u2018Don\u2019t come to the United States because the welfare system\u2019s not as good as you\u2019ll find in Australia and New Zealand.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
