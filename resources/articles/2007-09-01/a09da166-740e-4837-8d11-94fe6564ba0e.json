When the heat was at its fiercest, at the end of the group stage, Steve McClaren stepped out from behind the shadow of Sven-Goran Eriksson to address the critics. \"You're missing something,\" he told the media. \"We're through to the second round and he's played in all three games.\" What he meant was that Heskey's contribution needed to be measured in a currency other than the centre-forward's own goals. Heskey did go on to score in the 3-0 dismissal of Denmark, his first international goal in nine months. He was also England's outstanding player in the subsequent defeat in the quarter-final, as Brazil's centre-backs could attest. His strength and persistence were a constant embarrassment to Edmilson and Roque Junior, and his searching diagonal ball forced Lucio into the error that allowed Michael Owen to open the scoring on that ill-fated evening in Shizuoka. Their partnership, created in England's under-18 and under-21 teams and fitfully maintained during their time together at Liverpool, was reassembled on Saturday simply because, three years after Heskey's last appearance in an England shirt, no better option was available. The injury to Wayne Rooney, whose arrival in the senior ranks in 2003 provided the cue for Heskey to slip gradually into the wings, and the suspension of Peter Crouch, who took his leading role at Liverpool, plus the unproven qualities of several possible understudies, created the opportunity for an unexpected return to the colours. But the latest result of McClaren's recent trawl through England's somewhat tarnished former glories reminded spectators of the Eriksson era in a more profound and intriguing way. Albeit against a very poor Israel, England played with a calmness and an internal logic similar to the qualities inspired by the Swedish coach when, in the early days of his tenure, he rebuilt a side left in tatters by Kevin Keegan through the simple expedient of choosing complementary players and putting them in their correct positions. As a first principle of football coaching, you really can't beat it. And so, despite that head-clutching miss early on, when Owen had set him up with a precise pass, and a far-post header that went into the side netting a few minutes later, Heskey did enough to get people wondering whether McClaren will stick with him for the match against Russia on Wednesday, when Crouch will again be available. For the head coach, it must be a question of which criterion to apply. In terms of the statistic by which centre-forwards are usually judged, there can be no contest. In 44 matches for England, Heskey has scored five goals. Crouch, three years younger as well as four inches taller, already has 12 in 20 matches. For his club and his country, Crouch has proved able to score at an impressive rate despite the feeling that his coaches have never quite trusted him enough to make him an automatic first choice. The goals are the only answer he can give. Like Heskey, Crouch is a committed team player who has no problem in dropping back to link the play while a partner such as Owen, with different priorities, loiters on the last defender's shoulder. Crouch has better ball control than might be assumed from his gangling limbs, but is a less effective header of the ball than his sheer height would suggest. Both men create problems for defenders through their physical endowments, but Heskey is the more usefully predictable of the two from the perspective of his team-mates. He is more likely to be in position to accept the ball from a colleague under pressure, and his touch and lack of ego enable him to play quick, sensible passes to those in better positions. We saw plenty of that on Saturday, and it helped spread an air of assurance through the whole team. \"Emile came in and did exactly what we expected him to do,\" McClaren said afterwards. \"He made space and he gave us a target.\" The head coach had observed Heskey the previous week, playing for Wigan at St James' Park, when Owen scored a late winner for Newcastle. \"I watched him closely and his attitude and his work rate were the important thing. Players find a home, and he seems to have found a good home at Wigan. They're treating him well and he's playing well.\" He and Owen, McClaren observed, \"like playing together\" and it seems certain that Owen's views carried weight when the head coach was pondering his starting line-up for Saturday. Heskey was there at the start of the move that led to Owen's stunningly beautiful second-half goal, perhaps the best he has scored for England since that scintillating strike against Argentina in Saint-Etienne in 1998. There is no doubt that, asked again for his input, Owen would give the same advice ahead of Wednesday's far sterner test, and he would be supported by many who felt that Heskey has often been unfairly maligned. As his erstwhile team-mate, now McClaren's successor as Middlesbrough manager, remarked in Japan five years ago, Heskey refuses to conform in anything other than his physical dimensions to the stereotype of the English No9 - the \"selfish bastard\", to use Southgate's term. Had he possessed anything like the arrogance of a Malcolm MacDonald or an Alan Shearer - or even of a Micah Richards, come to that - he would by now have a hundred caps and a half-century of goals. But as he nears his 30th birthday, perhaps it is time to take full advantage of what he is, rather than what he is not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
