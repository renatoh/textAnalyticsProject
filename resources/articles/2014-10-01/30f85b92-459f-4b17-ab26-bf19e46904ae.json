The singer known as Mel C condemned female pop stars for flaunting their flesh and featuring explicit content in their music videos and live performances. Speaking to the Radio Times, she urged artists to \u201chave more dignity\u201d and said she was concerned about their influence on her daughter, Scarlett. Artists such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna have long caused controversy with their explicit videos and wardrobes. Mel C said pop stars should show more responsibility: \u201cMy five-year-old loves Rihanna. But she has no idea what her idol looks like because there\u2019s little footage that I\u2019m happy for her to see. It\u2019s a shame that a talented, successful woman expresses herself in such an overtly sexual way.\u201d Mel C said the problem did not \u201cboil down\u201d to one female singer, and that a bigger conversation was needed about society\u2019s obsession with celebrity and the effect it was having on children. \u201cIt\u2019s vulgar and narcissistic and I worry about how it affects girls,\u201d she added. Speaking about her experience in the Spice Girls, who popularised the slogan \u201cgirl power\u201d in the 1990s, the former Sporty Spice said the group \u201cweren\u2019t interested in pleasing men\u201d and made music to empower girls and women. \u201cThere are some great artists out there, but sometimes we could just do with a bit more dignity,\u201d she said. Mel C\u2019s comments come amid growing concerns about sexual content in music videos, and with the launch of a pilot scheme to give age ratings to raunchy videos shown online in the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
