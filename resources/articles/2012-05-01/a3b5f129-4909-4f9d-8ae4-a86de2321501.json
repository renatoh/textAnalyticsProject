Should Djokovic, the world No1 and the man who won seven of their previous eight clashes, come out on top, the Serb will go into next week's French Open believing he can join the elite club to have won four straight grand slam titles. But if Nadal can repeat his triumph from Monte Carlo last month then the Spaniard, for so long the undisputed king of clay, will take an awful lot of stopping at Roland Garros. The semi-finals were equally impressive, for different reasons. Djokovic's 6-2, 7-6 victory over Roger Federer was a statement of intent, the Serb strutting around the Foro Italico's Campo Centrale as if he owned it. Having won the title last summer with a stunning win over Nadal, he probably thinks he does and Federer, the winner last weekend in Madrid, never looked like stopping him. Nadal's 7-6, 6-0 win over his fellow Spaniard David Ferrer was a war of attrition in the first set and then, once the resistance had been broken, a cakewalk in the second. Nadal suggested that the title is more important than psychology but Djokovic admitted it would hold real significance. \"I am really satisfied I am in another final, I made another great win against a great player in Roger Federer,\" Djokovic said. \"I will try to win another trophy and he will too. We have a great rivalry, he is the player I have played most in my career. It's going to be a tough fight but definitely it would help for both of us to get this trophy before going to Paris.\" Nadal has looked back to his very best this week, erasing the memory of his early defeat on the slippery, blue clay of Madrid. Victory on Sunday would take the Spaniard back above Federer into the world No2 spot and, having won the titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, a sixth Rome crown would be the perfect tonic heading to Paris. \"It is an important match,\" Nadal said of the final. \"We have to say that because it's true. It's an important match to close the clay-court season before Roland Garros with perfect feelings. But if I don't have the victory tomorrow \u2013 for me, we forget about Madrid because that was not clay \u2013 my feelings on clay were fantastic all the time so for me it's been an almost perfect clay-court season. \"But for me it's much more important to win Rome than to win against Djokovic. I won against him in Monte Carlo this year so I broke that bad record of 7-0 and if I lose here it's going to be 1-0, not eight. The important thing is I win the tournament and I say that from my heart.\" It is always a bad sign for Federer when he starts throwing his empty water bottles over his shoulder at the changes of ends; the perfect example of the toys being thrown out of the pram. The Swiss made too many mistakes to really trouble Djokovic and, though he rallied late in the second set, the way the world No1 gathered himself, regained his focus and stamped his authority on the tiebreak was hugely impressive. Sunday's women's final will be between the defending champion, Maria Sharapova, of Russia and China's Li Na, a repeat of last year's French Open semi-final, which the Chinese won on the way to her first grand slam title. Sharapova eased to a 90-minute straight-sets win over the German Angelique Kerber in the semi-final. The Russian broke twice in each set and won 63% of points on her own serve to close out a 6-3, 6-4 win. Sharapova made 27 winners to her opponent's nine and her serve, which can be inconsistent, was a weapon. Li Na was due to face Serena Williams in her semi-final but the American withdrew with a back problem. The former world No1 insisted the injury will not prevent her from competing at the French Open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
