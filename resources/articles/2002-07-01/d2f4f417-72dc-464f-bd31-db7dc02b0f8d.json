While the fastest milkman in the west was threatening in spectacular fashion to set the course ablaze up front, the spark failed to ignite for Tiger Woods yesterday afternoon but, incredibly, at four under par he is still handily placed to win his third major title of the year. Perhaps it was the dampening effect of the rain that splattered down on Muirfield throughout the day but the current Masters and US Open champion, dressed soberly from top to toe in Dylan Thomas's bible black, played sombre golf to match. Once again it was frighteningly efficient golf from tee to green, blemishes only coming on the two occasions he abandoned the security of long irons from the tee and unleashed the heavy artillery, only to miss the fairway on each occasion, if to no ultimate damage. Yet as in his first round, his putting was, by his mighty standards, off colour. There are, Lee Trevino once opined, two things with a short life expectancy: dogs that chase cars and pros who need to hole putts for pars. There is no danger for Woods on this front - his second putts, generally from inside two inches it seemed, were holed with monotonous regularity - but with just a smidgen more luck he would already have the rest of the field gazing at his tail lights. Nevertheless, bogeys avoided can be as valuable as birdies gained on this course, and Woods managed this, with a blip-free round of 68, which included birdies at the par-four 3rd, the long 5th and, after a frustrating couple of hours where it seemed as if hole after hole had a force-field around it, at the 17th, where he knocked in a putt of 15 feet or so from off the green. The 5th created its own drama, for his drive was immediately followed by desperate yells of \"fore right\" as the ball cut away into the crowds that were lining the fairway 300 yards away. Lucky lad, as he confessed later: he had cleared the deep rough and landed on the path trampled by spectators, leaving a perfectly playable lie. If you are going to miss, miss bad, he says. A posse of marshals and minders cleared a tunnel 30 yards long and nerve-rackingly narrow (\"There is a tendency to poke heads out and peek,\" the crowd were advised by one minder good- humouredly, \"and this is not a good idea.\") and with an earth-shaking thump from his two iron, Woods sent his ball whistling to the front of the green to set up his birdie. He ought to have collected a further shot at the par-five 9th, when two iron shots found him just short of the green with the pin cut to the front. But his first putt skated past and he missed the return. Par only but he would, one supposes, regard that as a shot gone. \"Let it rain, who cares?\" wrote AA Milne in Now We Are Six. Well, Phil Mickelson apparently and perhaps after his experience on the opening hole yesterday it should be reissued as Now We Have Taken Six. For someone who is established as the No2 player in the world, Mickelson did an excellent impression yesterday morning of wanting to be back at his home in Arizona, or California where he has another, or indeed anywhere dry, rather than standing on the first tee in the tumbling rain as it drip-dripped from the peak of his sun visor. Not for him the belt and braces of rain suit and brolly - bit too uncool perhaps for the all-American boy - so instead he hunched his shoulders and thrust his hands deep into his jacket pockets as he stalked down the fairway. Mickelson has an unhappy relationship with major championships, of which he had played 40 before this one without success, and the Open in particular. Starting as an amateur at Birkdale in 1991, this is his tenth Open and 34 rounds have left him 60 over par now, 28 of those coming also at Birkdale, this time four years ago, when he managed to shoot 85 in the third round. There is a feeling that if Mickelson is to realise his potential in the majors, and justify his lofty status, he needs to convert from cavalier to puritan by reining in his attacking instincts and settling for less extravagant but more effective play. As Kenny Rogers sang, \"You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em.\" It was not the most auspicious of starts for, having tugged his opening shot to the right, he found, just as had Woods on Thursday, his ball sitting down in the wringing-wet clinging rough. Did ambition get the better of him? Certainly, when the golden rule is first and foremost to make sure the ball emerges on to some cut stuff, he seemed to be eyeing the green almost 200 yards away. He swung with willowy vigour, felt the shock sizzle up the nerves in his arm and saw the ball plummet into more rough just 20 yards forward. This time, with little ceremony, he hacked out on to the fairway, got his next on to the green and two-putted for a double bogey. It set the tone for his round, for while he managed immediately to get one of the shots back on the 2nd, he found the rough again on the 3rd and after missing the green to the right on the short 4th, and hitting the pin with the most delicate chip up the slope, he undid the good work by missing the return. Out in 39, three over par, he fared little better on the way in - double and single bogeys at the 14th and 15th offset only by a birdie at the 546-yard penultimate hole - to finish with 76 and a sweat on the cut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
