The 11-page briefing note explains the party\u2019s position on nine key areas and \u201cstrongly advises\u201d prospective Tory MPs \u201cagainst signing up to any pledges\u201d unless they have been agreed from the centre. However, supporting shooting is allowed \u201cas an important part of rural life\u201d, the document says. Although the briefing sets out why signing up to certain pledges are unnecessary and could backfire, the demands from Tory HQ are likely to be seized on by opposition leaders, who insist the party cannot be trusted to keep its promises on certain important issues. The document, titled \u201cIssue campaign responses\u201d, gives an insight into how candidates will be expected to stick to a strict script, with little wriggle room beyond the template responses provided for them. Drafted by the Conservative research department last weekend, the memo acknowledges that candidates \u201cwill be asked to sign pledges on various campaign issues\u201d and then sets out a cheat sheet of \u201csubstantive responses that can be used as a basis for a reply\u201d. The issues on which candidates have been told to avoid signing up to pledges include: Trade deals with the NHS. The memo warns candidates to avoid signing any pledges to \u201cprotect our NHS from trade deals with new legislation which ends privatisation\u201d. It says this kind of pledge would \u201cgive credence to factually inaccurate smears \u2026 The NHS is not for sale.\u201d It says candidates should focus instead on \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to override the British people on Brexit\u201d. Climate change. Tory candidates are told that many campaigns to tackle climate change \u201ccontain unrealistic targets that would be impossible to achieve\u201d and that it would be better to focus on \u201cpractical, reasonable steps to protect our planet while keeping bills down\u201d. The memo claims Labour does not have a credible approach to the problem Women\u2019s state pension age. This highly charged issue could be a significant factor for women in the general election as the age for receiving a state pension rises from 60 to 65. Boris Johnson has promised to review the change, but the memo urges candidates not to engage on the issue. \u201cAvoid signing [pledges],\u201d it says. \u201cChanges to the state pension age are part of a long overdue move towards gender equality and will put the pensions system on a more sustainable footing for future generations.\u201d Standing up for Brexit. The memo says it is unnecessary to pledge to stand up for Brexit because \u201ca Conservative government with a functioning majority will immediately get Brexit done\u201d. Other pledges to avoid relate to private schools. Tory hopefuls are told they could say: \u201cLabour\u2019s plans to abolish private schools \u2026 would dramatically increase class sizes and do nothing for our children\u2019s education.\u201d The memo says candidates \u201cmay sign if they deem appropriate to do so\u201d pledges on shooting and river pollution. The template response on the former topic includes an acknowledgment that \u201cfor many people shooting is an important part of rural life \u2026 worth around \u00a32bn to the economy, much of it in some of our remotest communities\u201d. River pollution pledges are deemed safe for endorsement, according to the memo, especially if they can be linked to Brexit. Candidates are told to say: \u201cLeaving the EU is a defining opportunity for the UK to set its own course and take ambitious action to protect our natural environment for future generations.\u201d The briefing note urges candidates to alert party chiefs if they are asked to sign pledges on other topics. \u201cIf you have received a request to sign a pledge that is not included in this pack, please send to [omitted] for advice on a response.\u201d Asked about the document, a Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cIt is commonplace for political parties to provide briefing.\u201d The party emphasised that it advised not signing pledges on trade deals and the NHS because \u201cthe NHS is not for sale and no trade agreement will change this fact\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
