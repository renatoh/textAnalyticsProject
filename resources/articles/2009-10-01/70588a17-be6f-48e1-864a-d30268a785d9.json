In fact he is hoping to go one better. Smith, who at 20 won world championship and Olympic bronze medals on the same apparatus, plans to win Britain's first men's world title. Having qualified in third place performing his easier routine, Smith said he may leave it until the last moment to decide which routine to go with in the final. \"I think it's either going to be a 16.9 or a 17 [difficulty rating]. I haven't done that in competition before but I've done it in training hundreds of times.\" Potentially delaying such a decision until the competition actually starts is illustrative of the coolness of Smith's nerves. The very same scenario panned out in Beijing last year as, watching the favourite, Xiao Qin, fault in the final, Smith decided to go for the more difficult routine minutes before he took to the platform. \"There's a new shear [in my routine] but it's really stable in training,\" said Smith, \"We wouldn't think about doing it at the world championships if there were any risks. There's always a risk of falling off but if it wasn't stable we wouldn't do it. We're going to look at the statistics and work out on the day what we need to do.\" If the Peterborough-based gymnast does opt for the 17 start valuehere in London, it is likely to be the most technically difficult routine seen in the final. The only contender who could come close to that kind of technical ability is Krisztian Berki of Hungary, the pommel specialist who took silver ahead of Smith at the last worlds in 2007 and gold ahead of him at the European championships this year. The 24-year-old will prove stiff competition in the final, along with China's Zhang Hongtao, who took first place in the qualifying round. \"The final is a completely different competition and another day,\" said Smith. \"I may not have the people who beat me in Beijing here but there are a lot of people who didn't go to Beijing who are really good. I'll be happy if I just get through the competition with clean routines and my talent will get me whatever result I'm supposed to get.\" London's O2 arena was packed to the rafters last night as the women's all-around final got under way. Despite the support Britain's Becky Downie could not improve on her Beijing performance. Her scores were marked by two falls \u2013 from the beam and the uneven bars \u2013 and she finished 16th while her team-mate Rebecca Wing came 18th. However, the favourites China's Deng Linlin and Russia's Ekaterina Kurbatova both failed to live up to expectations. Instead the Americans dominated the competition, with Bridget Sloan winning gold and Rebecca Bross taking silver. Japan's Koko Tsurumi took bronze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
