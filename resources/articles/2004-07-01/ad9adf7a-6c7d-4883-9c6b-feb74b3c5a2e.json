Born: March 12, 1986. Occupation: Guitarist/vocalist in current teen sensation, McFly. Their first two singles shot straight to number one in the charts and their debut album followed suit last week. McFly are reckoned to be a cut above your average boy band. College: Bury College. Course: BTec national diploma in music practice. Attended: 2002-2003. A tutor recalls: \"Danny did a course aimed at performing musicians. He was a very hard-working and exceptionally talented student, with great stage presence. He really stood out. He was an extremely good soloist and guitar player. He loved his music and was one of the few who we knew would get somewhere straightaway. We are all very pleased for him, not least because my niece now thinks I am an absolute hero because I taught Danny!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
