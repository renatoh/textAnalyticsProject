The new regulations barred public accounts from posting \u201cuser-generated audio or video\u201d, often one of the few sources of information outside state media articles relaying the government\u2019s version of events. China has some of the most pervasive censorship in the world. Activists have been jailed for as little as a single tweet, editors at outspoken newspapers are sacked and news articles deemed inappropriate by officials are swiftly deleted. It was ranked by Reporters Without Borders as one of the worst countries for press freedom, with conditions better than only North Korea, Syria, Turkmenistan and Eritrea. China\u2019s two largest social media platforms were called out by name in the new rules, with the majority of videos shared on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo and WhatsApp meets Facebook WeChat. \u201cWeibo, WeChat and other online social media are not allowed to disseminate user-generated audio or video programs about current events,\u201d said the notice from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. Social media companies must \u201cstrengthen management\u201d of videos, a common euphemism for censorship. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to weed out smaller players,\u201d said Duncan Clark, founder of investment advisory firm BDA China, which specialises in the Chinese internet. \u201cThe government prefers to have concentration on larger sites, where it has greater sway. \u201cThere has also been an explosion of live-streaming sites in recent years, and the government is keen to rein them in and assert control,\u201d he added. But the larger implications for China\u2019s already limited freedom of online speech will depend on how strongly the new rules are implemented, Clark said. Videos made by internet users has boomed in the past year, with live streaming apps some of the most popular, quickly running afoul of censors. Weibo has more than 400m video views each day according to some estimates. \u201cWe are seeing short video and live video taking off,\u201d Gaofei Wang, Weibo\u2019s CEO, said in a recent financial filing, adding that the company\u2019s main source of new expenses was from an increase in hosting video. Videos shot on mobile phones are often the only record of a side of China rarely seen by the outside world or the millions of Chinese who consume only government-approved media. Images that quickly spread online include the thousands of minor protests that happen every year across China, wrongdoing by police, or evidence of Tibetan self immolations. The ban comes just weeks after a draft law aimed to give local police the power to censor the internet in the wake of natural disasters, another situation where the government often struggle to control the narrative. Foreign internet companies have had to choose between censorship and access. Facebook is reportedly working on a tool that suppresses content in news feeds in an attempt to overcome a seven year ban, while Google publicly pulled out of China after it stopped complying with government censorship directives. The news landed quietly among China\u2019s internet users, with only a handful discussing the new rules on Sina Weibo, many seemingly resigned to ever increasing censorship. \u201cThe authorities regulate everything, what a step backward for Weibo,\u201d one user said on the online platform. \u201cWhat do we do now, just give up on self-made media?\u201d another commenter said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
