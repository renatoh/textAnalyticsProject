Having touched a session low of 3,860.3 today, the lowest level since September 1996, the index closed up 27.4 points at 4021.9. An early 67-point rally after opening was short-lived, and the index traded below the 4,000 mark for most of the day, having hit a five-and-a-half-year closing low of 3994.5 yesterday. The 5.4% drop was the biggest one-day percentage fall since a 5.7% loss on September 11. Traders in New York this morning sent the Dow Jones index plummeting more than 200 points in early trading, but by midday the loss was closer to 80 points. Yesterday the key index of blue chip stocks had rallied back from a 400-point plunge to close down 45.34 points at 8639.19. However, Mr Greenspan's upbeat assessment on the state of the US economy stemmed the slide on both sides of the Atlantic. He told the Senate banking committee that the economy is on its way to full recovery, although it will keep feeling the effects of last year's recession for some time yet. Mr Greenspan also said the Fed will not raise interest rates until the economy shows further strengthening. Hank Potts, an equities strategist at Barclays Private Clients in London, said markets were expecting the Dow Jones to drop more than 100 points first thing today. \"On Wall Street, there was a kind of rally [yesterday], but there was no strength or commitment in it in reality,\" he said. Traders have been put off by a series of accounting scandals in the US, most notably Enron and WorldCom, and by fears that upcoming quarterly results from blue chip companies will disappoint. The Wall Street Journal reported that technology giant Intel, due to announce results after Wall Street closes today, may announce job losses or other cuts. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei share index rose at first, but closed the day down some 1.2%, at 10,250.4 points. The drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline led Europe's blue-chip losers, tumbling 8.6% following news that a generic version of its top-selling drug Augmentin had been launched in the US, earlier than some analysts expected. Britain's Prudential and France's Axa led a decline in insurance stocks with falls of 4.2% and 3.4% respectively. Markets have been in retreat since March when a post-September 11 recovery began running out of steam. Doubts about the US economy and Wall Street have been crystallised by the fall of the dollar as investors take their chances with the euro. Chris Chaitow, a technical analyst at the brokers Collins Stewart, believes that the bear market will last for months yet with plenty of scope for further market losses. \"This bear market has probably another four to five months to go and substantial downside,\" Mr Chaitow told Reuters. \"European stock benchmarks could fall another 25% before they form a base. It's been a vicious bear market on the way down and it's still in full flood. There are a lot of companies in serious trouble.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
