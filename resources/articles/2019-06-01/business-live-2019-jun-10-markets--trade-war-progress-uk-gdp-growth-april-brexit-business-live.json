UK GDP shrank by 0.4% in April, rather worse than economists expected, dragging the rolling three-month growth rate down to 0.3%. The decline was due to a 3.9% contraction across manufacturing, the worst decline since 2002, as UK car producers implemented planned shutdowns in case Britain had crashed down of the European Union at the end of March. Car manufacturing slumped by 24%, while transport output suffered its biggest monthly fall since 1974. Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics blamed car shutdowns and the unwinding of some Brexit stockpiling: \u201cGDP growth showed some weakening across the latest 3 months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns. \u201cThere was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date has faded.\u201d The construction sector also had a bad month, down 0.4%, while service sector was flat. Economists fear that the UK economy will continue to struggle. The NIESR thinktank\u2019s GDP tracker suggests it\u2019s on track to shrink by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. April\u2019s contraction follows a 0.1% drop in GDP in March. John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, warns that the economy is weakening while government MPs focus on the race to succeed Theresa May. \u201cThe whole country is hurting while the Tory leadership candidates compete on tax cuts for high earners. \u201cWith GDP going backwards over two consecutive months, this government is resembling a business entering administration. \u201cWages, investment and productivity are all stagnant \u2013 and only Labour\u2019s plan for a \u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage, National Transformation Fund and regional industrial strategy will deliver the sustainable growth we need to turn this ailing economy around.\u201d Wall Street has shrugged off Donald Trump\u2019s new threat to impose tariffs on Mexico. Stocks are rising in early trading, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 163 points to 26,147. That\u2019s its highest level in a month, on relief that Mexican imports into America won\u2019t face new levies from today. As well as Brexit, the UK economy has been weighted down by recent trade tensions, with America and China\u2019s tit-for-tat tariffs dampening global growth. So... UK bosses (particularly manufacturers) won\u2019t be pleased to hear that Donald Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on Mexico, just a couple of days after suspending this threat. Trump has tweeted that a secret agreement has been agreed with Mexico to curb migration at the US border - and Mexico\u2019s parliament had better pass it, or else.... It confirms Trump\u2019s relish for using trade policy to tackle other political issues, which adds uncertainty to the global economy. Economist Josie Dent of the CEBR thinktank fears that the unwinding of Brexit stockpiling will weigh on growth for some time: Today\u2019s data paints a sobering picture. Unless the economy makes a significant comeback, we are likely to see negative growth in the three months to May. However, early indicators suggest that this is unlikely, as manufactures are using up goods they stockpiled in the first three months of the year instead of producing new ones\u201d She also reckons the economy will only grow by around 0.1% in the second quarter of the year (April-June), a little more optimistic than NIESR. Ouch! NIESR, the think tank, has warned that the UK economy may shrink by 0.2% in the current quarter. That would put Britain half-way into a Brexit-induced recession. NIESR fears that there hasn\u2019t been a \u201cmeaningful\u201d recovery in May, following the 0.4% drop in GDP in April revealed this morning. So if manufacturing and construction keep shrinking, the overall economy could contract this quarter -- having grown by 0.5% in January-March. Garry Young, head of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, said \u201cThe UK economy is on course to contract by 0.2% in the second quarter. The latest GDP data were weaker than expected, partly reflecting shifts in production around the original Brexit departure date, including a 24% fall in car manufacturing. The underlying picture is also quite weak, with Brexit-related uncertainty at home and trade tensions abroad dragging on investment spending and economic growth\u201d. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on April\u2019s UK GDP report: The British economy shrank in April amid a dramatic decline in car production ahead of the original Brexit deadline, according to official figures. According to the Office for National Statistics, gross domestic product (GDP) plunged by 0.4% in April from a month earlier as factories across the country launched a wave of planned shutdowns to avoid any disruption that could have been unleashed by a no-deal Brexit. Britain\u2019s manufacturers planned around leaving the EU on 29 March as Theresa May took the country to the brink of leaving without a deal, before agreeing an extension until 12 April and then delaying the process until the end of October. She then agreed to stand down as prime minister, triggering the Conservative leadership contest. While economic growth had strengthened as factories rushed to stockpile materials ahead of the deadline, the latest snapshot from the economy shows that production slumped after the target date passed..... More here: GDP measures all the economic activity in an economy (or at least it tries to). But it doesn\u2019t measure more important things -- quality of life, happiness, and mental health. Last week, New Zealand tried to amend this flaw by using wellbeing as a key measure when setting budgets. Dan Button, senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation, argues that Britain should do the same. He writes: The focus on GDP masks what\u2019s really going on. The economy described by the growth figures released this morning does not reflect the reality for most people, who do not feel the effect of rising GDP on their daily lives. GDP can continue to grow while wages stagnate, housing remains unaffordable, life expectancy stalls and the planet heats up. Growth in GDP isn\u2019t spread evenly: the UK is right at the top of the league table of regional inequality, with a huge proportion of the country\u2019s economic activity concentrated in London and the south-east. More here: Britain\u2019s April downturn shows that the public should get a final say on Brexit, argues Labour MP Wes Streeting. Streeting, who supports the People\u2019s Vote campaign, says: Brexit is already causing serious and lasting harm to our economy. News that the economy contracted in April shows the seriousness of the crisis and the extremely high stakes for jobs, investment and public services. British industry is feeling the strain, with British steel and car manufacturing on the brink. And the threat of a destructive No Deal now hangs over every decision facing businesses small and large across the country. They know that WTO terms are the worst trading terms in the world and that No Deal threatens a new economic crisis. \u201cNow we know the real costs of Brexit, the public must be allowed back into this process. Forcing No Deal \u2013 for which there is no mandate \u2013 on the country is not a solution. And nor is it a solution to run down the clock with fruitless attempts at renegotiation of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cThe only way to deliver a stable and lasting settlement, and to give businesses and workers the certainty they need, is through a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d Although manufacturing slumped by almost 4% in April, it actually grew in the February-April quarter. That suggests factories were racing to stockpile goods and fulfil orders before the end of March, in case they lost access to European markets, only to relapse panting for air in April after the Brexit extension was agreed. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Brexit hurt the UK economy in April: The Independent\u2019s Ben Chapman points out that today\u2019s GDP report is much worse than economists expected: The UK economy shrank 0.4 per cent in April as the Brexit paralysis took hold following the proposed deadline for departure from the EU. The latest monthly fall was four times larger than analysts had forecast and marked the second consecutive month of contraction for the UK\u2019s economy after a 0.1 per cent drop in March. Stockpiling of goods to deal with a disorderly Brexit on 29 March slowed down after deadline day was moved back to 31 October. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the earlier months of this year had been boosted as manufacturers in particular built up supplies. As that effect wore off, industrial production declined by 2.7 per cent in April compared to March while manufacturing slumped by 3.9 per cent - the sharpest drop since June 2002. The slide in UK manufacturing in April shows the dangers of Brexit uncertainty, warns TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cIndustry is paying the price for the government\u2019s Brexit chaos. \u201cThis is the biggest decline in car production since 1974. With plants like Ford Bridgend already closing, it\u2019s time to get serious about the scale of the threat facing our economy. \u201cPoliticians must do whatever it takes to stop a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Reuters has spotted that UK transport production fell at its fastest rate in over 40 years in April, as car plants held their annual shutdowns early. Output from Britain\u2019s car-making sector slumped by 24% in April, the ONS says. That\u2019s because bosses took the decision to move planned shutdowns to April, in case the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal at the end of March. This wiped 13% off transport production, dragging overall manufacturing down by nearly 4% -- the worst since June 2002. Economist Rupert Seggins argues that the slowdown in Britain\u2019s service sector (which makes up three-quarters of the economy) is more serious than the slump in manufacturing. Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG UK, fears that the UK faces many more months o weak growth: \u201cThe hangover that\u2019s followed the UK\u2019s original exit date is proving stronger than anticipated. Today\u2019s figures signal the UK economy is likely to experience more subdued growth for the rest of the year, marred by Brexit uncertainty. \u201cThe significant drop in car manufacturing, and in broader manufacturing activity at the start of Q2, point at more than just a reversal of the stock building effect seen as businesses prepared for an expected Brexit in March. \u201cWhile services saw a slight improvement in April, continued weakness of financial services and the hospitality sector do not bode well for the overall prospects for the economy this year.\u201d Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics fears that the UK economy could stall, or even shrink, in the current quarter. She says the contraction in April shows that the \u201cBrexit hangover\u201d was bigger than feared, telling clients: The deluge of activity data suggested that the economy got off to a bad start in Q2. Indeed, the economy shrank by 0.4% m/m in April, the second monthly contraction in a row. This meant that the 3m/3m rate slowed to 0.3% (consensus 0.4%), following Q1\u2019s 0.5% gain. The sectoral breakdown of growth made for pretty discouraging reading too. Construction contracted in April by 0.4% m/m, while services output only managed to stagnate. The surprise was just how sharply manufacturing output plunged. It fell by 3.9% m/m. Admittedly, a couple of temporary factors dragged on growth in April. The first is the unwinding of the stockpiling boost \u2013 which saw firms increasing their stocks in Q1 to protect themselves against a possible no deal Brexit on 29th March. The other is the decision by car manufacturers to bring forward their annual production shutdowns from August to April in case of a no deal, which resulted in a 24% m/m drop in vehicle production \u2013 the biggest monthly fall since records began. Given the sector\u2019s weight in GDP (1.5%), this knocked a chunky 0.2ppts off overall GDP. That will come back in May. However, even without this, then, GDP would have fallen by 0.2% m/m in April. We had thought GDP would rise by 0.2% q/q in Q2 but it\u2019s now possible that GDP won\u2019t rise at all or even contract. Overall, the clear message is that underlying growth is pretty sluggish. With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year. The slide in growth in April shows that Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK economy, says Alessandro Capuano of Fineco Bank: After a resilient start to the year fuelled by Brexit stockpiling efforts, maintaining that momentum is proving to be a challenge. Last week we saw the first red signs following gloomy reports on the manufacturing and construction industries. Following a positive first-quarter mainly driven by an increase in inventory build-up, Q2 2019 is proving to be rather disappointing. Here\u2019s some expert reaction to the news that Britain\u2019s economy stumbled in April: Monthly GDP figures can be erratic, so it\u2019s sensible to look at the quarterly growth figures too. They show that the UK economy grew by 0.3% over the February-April period (despite contracting in both March and April). That\u2019s down from 0.5% growth in January-March, suggesting that the economy struggled as the Brexit crisis intensified this spring. The ONS\u2019s head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, has confirmed that the UK economy suffered from car plant shutdowns in April. He also points out that factories slowed their stockpiling activities, after the UK\u2019s Brexit date was pushed back to 31 October. Kent-Smith says: \u201cGDP growth showed some weakening across the latest 3 months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns. \u201cThere was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date has faded.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector stagnated in April, with no growth at all. The construction industry also had a bad month, with output down 0.4%. UK manufacturing suffered a sharp contraction in April, today\u2019s GDP report shows. Industrial production declined by 2.7% during the month, with manufacturing shrinking by an alarming 3.9%. This appears to be due to UK car plants shutting down in April, as manufacturers prepared for a no-deal Brexit which never came. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s economy shrank by 0.4% in April, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u2019s its biggest monthly fall since March 2016, and follows a 0.1% contraction on March. More to follow! The US stock market is expected to follow Asia and Europe higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 110 points in the futures market (actual trading begins in five hours). Relief that America won\u2019t impose new levies on Mexican imports is pulsing away, even though there\u2019s some confusion over what\u2019s exactly been agreed. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains: Markets are blowing small celebratory bubbles this morning as late on Friday the US announced a deal with Mexico to ensure that tariffs don\u2019t get imposed today as planned. However there was some subsequent confusion as Mr Trump tweeted that Mexico has agreed to buy \u201clarge\u201d amounts of agricultural products from the US as part of the deal. This didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere in the accord released and sources close to the negotiations suggested on Bloomberg that there weren\u2019t any additional side deals planned. So a bit puzzling but there will be relief that the tariffs have been avoided and perhaps some might believe it shows Trump\u2019s propensity to strike deals after brinkmanship. Holiday news: troubled tour operator Thomas Cook has confirmed that it\u2019s in talks with China\u2019s Fosun, its largest shareholder. Fosun is interested in buying Thomas Cook\u2019s tour operator business. A sale would provide the company with much-needed capital. More here: This morning\u2019s optimism doesn\u2019t extend to Neil Woodford. Shares in Woodford\u2019s publicly-traded fund, Woodford Patient Capital Trust, have hit a fresh record low this morning, down another 5% below 60p for the first time. That\u2019s despite an attempt this morning to reassure the City. In a brief and breezy statement (somewhat lacking in details), WPCT said it was \u201cpleased with the operational progress of its portfolio companies\u201d, and \u201cclosely monitoring the situation\u201d at Woodford Investment Management. This is WPCT\u2019s first public comment since another Woodfood fund, Equity Income, slammed the door to prevent investors getting out. A week on, Woodford\u2019s strategy -- and his links with financial platform Hargreaves Lansdown - are under major scrutiny. As the Sunday Times pointed out - Woodford investors have lost money, and paid fees for the privilege: Hargreaves Lansdown shares have dropped 2% this morning, to a two-month low. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a five-week high in early trading. The blue-chip index has gained 40 points to 7,370, its highest level since early May. Mining companies are among the top risers, with Antofagasta, Anglo American and BHP Group all up around 1.5%. They\u2019re all vulnerable to trade war worries, as weaker economic growth hits commodity prices. European stock markets have all begun the week strongly. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the US-Mexico deal is giving stocks a lift: It\u2019s a sea of green as stocks rebound on Trump\u2019s Mexican fix. Investors are relieved at Mexico and the US coming to an agreement to avoid the latter slapping the former with tariffs, and this sent equity futures north. But, he\u2019s also worried about the precedent of threatening a trade war to change immigration policies. Could the White House try the same trick with Europe, to force NATO members to spend more?... This may only embolden Mr Trump to use tariffs as policy tool for the pursuit of non-economic interests. As previously suggested, the EU could be next \u2013 maybe to get the 2% defence spending target. Commodity prices are also rallying this morning, after the US stepped back from hitting Mexico with new tariffs. The copper price has gained 0.6% to $5,831 per tonne, having fallen for the last eight weeks in a row. Nickel (1.3%) and lead (+1.2%) are also higher this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s tipping it down in London this morning, but that\u2019s not dampening the optimistic mood in the City, and across the global markets. Shares have jumped in Asia today after the US stepped back from launching a trade war with Mexico. Donald Trump\u2019s surprise change of heart means Mexican imports won\u2019t face 5% tariffs from today, a move that would have further escalated America\u2019s trade dispute with other economies. Trump\u2019s threat to use economic tariffs to tackle a political problems (migration at the US border) had worried the markets -- what other issues could the US try to solve by threatening trade war? Under the agreement, Mexico will immediately expand a border program that sends migrants seeking asylum in the US back to Mexico while they await adjudication, deploy more security officers to contain the flow of migrants headed to the US, and crack down on human smuggling, the declaration said. There\u2019s obvious relief that a deal\u2019s been reached -- even though several of Mexico\u2019s \u201cconcessions\u201d on asylum seekers were apparently agreed months ago. As Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets puts it: The biggest weekend news was Trump\u2019s Friday night tweet (and a formal joint US-MX statement) announcing an agreement which suspends Trump\u2019s tariffs threat on Mexico for now. Reading through the details, Mexico basically re-committed to existing promises (and maintained its own red line of rejecting safe third-country status) \u2013 aka Trump blinked. The reaction in Asia has been positive. Talk of blinking won\u2019t please the president, though - he wants more credit! Investors aren\u2019t bothered about the president\u2019s legacy though. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has jumped 1.2%, as a wave of buying swept Asian trading floors. China\u2019s CSI 300 index has gained 1%, with similar gains in Australia and South Korea too. The big question, though, is whether Trump is also prepared to cut a deal with Beijing, so he can notch up another \u2018win\u2019 ahead of next year\u2019s reelection race. Hopes of a breakthrough at this month\u2019s G20 leader\u2019s meeting could push European shares higher today. The FTSE 100 index is expected to jump 40 points to 7368, adding to Friday\u2019s rally. Hopes of an early US interest rate cut following Friday\u2019s weak US jobs report are also keeping traders optimistic (although, if we get a trade war deal, there\u2019s less need to cut borrowing costs to support the economy....) Also coming up today The latest GDP figures will show how Britain\u2019s economy performed in April, after the threat of a disorderly exit from the EU was delayed until October. Economists fear a small contraction (-0.1%), as the boost from Brexit stockpiling faded. We also get new UK trade data.
