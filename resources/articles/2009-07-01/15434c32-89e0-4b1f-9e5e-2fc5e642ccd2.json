They raised their hands. This happened after they had first considered the various opinions put before them at a planning meeting to approve Keswick's new climbing wall \u2013 a state-of-the-art \"rock-face\" housed in an agricultural building near Castlerigg stone circle. Seven to four went the voting in favour, a decision which lifted the climbers present. They had half-expected the amenity to be turned down because of its proximity to the spiritual aura of the standing stones. Doug Scott had made an impassioned plea for the climbing wall to stay, himself no stranger to expounding on the mystical quality of mountains. I have a feeling that had Harry Griffin been alive he would have joined him in support. Initially he did not approve of \"indoor climbing\". Before he died, however, he began to see how climbing walls honed climbers into the \"fleein' things\" that the Wasdale landlord Will Ritson meant when once asked about Scafell Crag. He replied \"nowt but a fleein' thing cud git up theer\". The answer stuck. Several days ago I walked from the Wasdale Head Inn up Mosedale some way above the roaring waters of Ritson's Force, arriving at the Y boulder \u2013 so called because of a prominent inverted Y-shaped crack. Victorian climbers would challenge one another to climb it upside down, in the manner of climbing-wall climbers where such problems can now be practised safely. How difficult it looked as rain swept the valley and water dripped from an overhang. I did not even attempt the feet-last versions either, the vertical rock looking too difficult, with every move a test in strength and concentration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
