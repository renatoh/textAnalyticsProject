In a recent article for Comment is free she concluded that the central issue was not about her non-existent affair with Colonel Owen McNally, but why so many Afghan civilians have been killed in Nato air strikes and whether or not the US military is covering up the truth about some of these deaths. Unfortunately the press coverage has continued to focus on the \"nudge, nudge, wink, wink\" allegations, which is presumably what whoever planted them was hoping. Writing in the Observer last weekend, Barbara Ellen complained female human rights workers were being portrayed as sluts \"wandering around war zones in cocktail dresses slashed to the thigh, hungry for the next thrill, perhaps a hunky military man to devour\". The Mail on Sunday meanwhile unearthed a \"second female aid worker\" whom McNally is said to have \"befriended\" and accused him of also helping her to compile a report on Afghan civilian casualties. However, even the journalist who wrote it appears to have realised the ludicrous nature of the story. \"There is no suggestion that he broke any rules,\" according to the article, which also quotes another source as saying \"they were friendly, but nothing more\". The woman in question, Norah Niland, is head of the UN mission's human rights department and a senior, well-known and highly respected UN official. McNally is the liaison officer between the UN and the British military. As anyone who has ever worked in a UN mission will know, it is their job to liaise with one another. They probably spend half their time going to the same meetings and their offices are right next door to one another. The crudeness of the attack reveals a certain desperation. The significance of the allegations is not their substance, but who is making them and why. The story first broke when a Sun article claimed that \"A British colonel is alleged to have leaked highly sensitive civilian casualty figures after being befriended by a woman from a human rights group. A senior source told the Sun that Lt Col Owen McNally started passing details to her when the pair became 'close' in Afghanistan.\" This story was then repeated by the Times on the same day and in much of the rest of the British press later in the week. Most of the coverage also mentioned that the US military were said to be \"seething\" that statistical information about civilian death numbers had been released into the public domain \u2013 and McNally's arrest appears to have been made as a result of this pressure. According to the Daily Mail, \"The figures are controversial because Britain and the US have been accused of downplaying the civilian death toll.\" A Ministry of Defence source told the Mail: \"What McNally passed on will not cost lives in the sense that it doesn't give specific military details. But the whole point of defeating the Taliban is winning hearts and minds and stopping the population joining their cause. If they think we're lying to them, it could become a very dangerous place. This has caused a diplomatic row and the Americans are not happy at all.\" This the real point of the story. The UN has repeatedly highlighted the issue of civilian casualties and this appears to have angered senior figures within the British and US military. As one UN official said in Kabul \"Are the British military saying that there are two sets of figures \u2013 one sanitised for the \"hearts and minds\" campaign and another more damning set of statistics showing that we are responsible for killing thousands of innocent people? Is McNally being investigated for revealing the truth?\" The answer to that is almost certainly yes, and the purpose of dragging Rachel Reid's name into the case was presumably to divert attention from this fact. Whoever did it knows that they have endangered her life. Female aid workers are disproportionately targeted by the Taliban for attack, and she has now been wrongly associated with both sexual immorality and military espionage, an extremely risky combination in a country like Afghanistan, even though, in this case, she is being portrayed as a Mata Hari in reverse. But McNally is the real target of the smear, which appears to have been motivated by institutional politics about the conduct of what is turning into an increasingly dirty war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
