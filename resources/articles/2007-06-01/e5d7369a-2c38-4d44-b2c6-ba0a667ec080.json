But one of the most remarkable aspects about the crew, who boast an average weight of 15\u00bdst and a height of 6ft 4in, is that the toughest man is not one of those giants but someone whose size should make him an also-ran. It says something about the formidable mind of Colin Smith that he is comfortable with the label of \"the toughest man in British rowing\". His crew-mate Andy Hodge acknowledges that Smith has something special: \"Colin's achievements, in spite of his size, shows just how powerful the mind is in producing world-class performance.\" The Zimbabwe-born Smith freely admits that he has not been blessed with any extraordinary technical or physical abilities: \"Technically, I do plenty of things wrong in the boat and there's nothing remarkable about my physiology.\" At 6ft and only 12\u00bdst, Smith looks tiny beside his colleagues. More than that, in the crucial 2km ergometer test, his personal best is nearly 18sec slower than most of his crew-mates. But his quiet self-belief has powered him to performance levels which should be beyond him. The foundations of that were partly laid in Zimbabwe. Smith lost his mother at an early age and recalls of how hard life sometimes was for his father and his siblings. \"In the supermarket we'd have to add up the bill halfway round to make sure we had enough money to pay,\" he recalls. When his family left, seven years ago, they went to New Zealand while Smith, armed with a scholarship, went alone to Britain. Perhaps that is why he often seems possessed of a wisdom beyond his 23 years - he is noted for seeking out rowing's wise old coaches, such as Mike Spracklen and Thor Nilson, and learning from them. But crucially for Smith, winning an Olympic gold is an essential part of making his separation from his family seem worthwhile. So it is not surprising that his determination has led him to the top of J\u00fcrgen Grobler's squad. But, as Smith points out, as recently as September the 60-year-old German was reluctant to include such a relatively small man in the elite group of Britain's top six rowers. \"At the start of the season, J\u00fcrgen thought I was too small for his top boats,\" he says. Grobler's reaction proved just the incentive Smith needed to take on and beat his bigger rivals. At the last World Cup in Linz earlier this month, Smith, together with his pairs partner Matthew Langridge, repaid Grobler's change of heart with a convincing win against world-class opposition. According to Sean Bowden, who coached Smith to Boat Race victory with Oxford in 2006, those remarkable performances are chiefly due to Smith's disciplined mental outlook. \"Mentally, Colin's extremely good,\" said Bowden. \"He takes full responsibility for his own performance and never uses excuses.\" It was at Oxford that Smith learnt the introvert's most challenging lesson, that his most important duty in a team sport is to help his crew-mates get the best out of themselves. His relationships with others have been revolutionised and, in his own words: \"At first I used to be a bit of a plonker but now I realise I need to understand my crew-mates, so anything I say to them helps them to row better.\" Oxford also honed his ability to deliver total focus: \"I learnt there that in a power-based sport, with my physique, success will only come if everything I do is absolutely always on the money.\" There have been times when Smith's intensity has not been to everybody's liking. But his friends value his good sense and advice. In time, he wants to pass that on to his own family. But for now, Smith's performance does present a challenge to his bigger and stronger colleagues. As he points out: \"I wouldn't be in a job if everybody was doing what I was doing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
