The battle over the coalition's plans to turn England's NHS inside out has been going on so long, the details are so arcane and claims of concessions so regular, it would be easy to imagine that the worst had been averted and common sense prevailed. But that could not be further from the case. As the health secretary Andrew Lansley boasted last autumn \u2013 after the Conservatives had accepted a \"pause\" in the progress of their health market and privatisation bill while Liberal Democrats were pacified with cosmetic concessions \u2013 its \"fundamental principles remain\". It was a rare moment of candour. As a group of lawyers and health academics spell out in the Lancet medical journal this week, if the health and social care bill is passed in its amended form it will abolish England's model of \"tax-financed, universal healthcare\", pave the way for a \"US-style health system\" based on \"mixed funding\" and fatally undermine \"entitlement to equality of healthcare provision\". Meanwhile, the preparations for this lurch towards market-driven private provision \u2013 at a cost of \u00a33bn \u2013 are already causing havoc with the government's parallel attempt to drive through the deepest cuts in the history of the NHS. So the hapless Lansley was on the back foot again yesterday, dismissing as \"Westminster nonsense\" the onslaught from the Commons health committee, which accused ministers of \"salami slicing\" NHS services and blamed the reorganisation for creating \"disruption and distraction\" from the task of effective reform and saving money. If the bill goes through, and the impact of the attempt to turn the NHS into a market-based free-for-all is felt as the cuts bite deeper, the government seems bound to face a political backlash. One of its own advisers, Chris Ham, has even raised the spectre of a an \"NHS version of the Arab spring\". By then the dismantling of Britain's greatest social achievement will already be in full flow. But even at this late stage, the NHS breakup bill can be stopped. Along with the health unions, the doctors' British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nurses and the Royal College of Midwives are now all demanding the bill be scrapped. This week, all 20 of the normally aloof and pliant Medical Royal Colleges are meeting to decide their response. Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners \u2013 98% of whose members support a call for the bill to be withdrawn \u2013 says she believes the government's plans will make services \"unsafe for patients\". This is, she tells me, a \"defining moment for our profession\". Such opposition across the medical professions is dangerous for David Cameron, who insisted last year \"we have to take our nurses and doctors with us\". The failure to do that could scarcely be more comprehensive. But if the prime minister won't listen to the people at the heart of the NHS he claims to love, the health bill could yet be defanged in the House of Lords, where the unlikely former Social Democratic party duo of Shirley Williams and David Owen have been waging guerrilla war against it for months. Or, given the scale of multiple Lords rebellions, there's a chance the NHS bill could run out of time. One way or another, it needs to be seen off. Cameron and Lansley insist they don't plan to privatise the NHS, of course. But that's exactly what's happening on the ground even before the bill hits the statute book. The first private company to take over an NHS hospital, the Tory-linked Circle Health, won the contract to run Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire in November, even as it admitted it may not be able to \"provide a consistent level of service to its patients\". And the government has been in talks with international health corporations about taking over 20 more, while private companies are already running local doctors' services and preparing to administer the clinical commissioning groups of GPs due to take over the purchaser role in the coalition's new market model. Facts are being created on the ground. Add to that ministers' announcement last month that they would raise the cap on the proportion of income English hospitals can raise from private work from about 2% to 49% \u2013 and the direction of travel could not be clearer. All of which builds on the exorbitant PFI contracts and private treatment centres in the NHS that flourished under New Labour. But whereas the existing law allows private provision, the coalition bill will require it. Crucially it also opens the way for the privatisation of funding, the introduction of charging and top-up payments for services that are currently free, and the cherry-picking of patients by commissioning groups \u2013 which will no longer have a duty to promote a comprehensive free health service. Ministers claim the new market model will put doctors in charge, slash bureaucracy and give power to patients. In all three cases, the opposite is the case. Lansley's reforms won't give the whip hand to GPs but to vested interests such as McKinsey and United Health. Private markets in health are notorious for their huge administrative costs, lack of accountability, conflicts of interest and inequity \u2013 while the NHS ranks as the industrial world's most efficient health service. And patients are already discovering that the referral management centres now second-guessing GPs' decisions are giving them less choice than they had 20 years ago. Tellingly, the government is straining every nerve to prevent the publication of its own risk assessment of the likely impact of its health \"reforms\". Unless the health professionals combine to force a U-turn, or rebellious parliamentarians succeed in pushing through the crucial red-line amendments, Cameron and Lansley's plans stand to put an end to the NHS in all but name. It's not inevitable, though. Cameron's promise to protect the health service was essential to his election and if he is seen to have broken it, the damage will be toxic. To most people in Britain, the NHS is a uniquely popular and progressive institution that touches almost everyone's lives. To the Tories and their friends it's a huge untapped business opportunity. But it's not too late to save it from the barbarians. twitter.com/seumasmilne"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
