Duncan Larcombe, 36, was arrested at his home in Kent on suspicion of conspiracy to corrupt and conspiracy to cause misconduct in a public office. He is the 12th current and former Sun journalist to have been arrested. All of the arrests follow information passed to the Met Police's Operation Elveden by News International's inhouse management and standards committee. Other Sun journalists who have been arrested on suspicion of making corrupt payments include Geoff Webster, a deputy editor of the Sun, and Fergus Shanahan, a former deputy editor. Detectives also arrested a former serviceman, 42, and a woman, 38, at their home in Lancashire. Officers carried out searches at the homes of those under arrest. The man was held on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, and the woman on suspicion of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office. They are being questioned at a police station in Lancashire. Scotland Yard said: \"Today's operation is the result of information provided to police by News Corporation's management [and] standards committee. It relates to suspected payments to a public official and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately.\" Previous arrests caused controversy at the Sun, with Trevor Kavanagh, the title's associated editor, writing in February that the newspaper's \"journalists are being treated like members of an organised crime gang\". Responding, Sue Akers, the detective assistant commissioner in charge of the Elveden operation, told the Leveson Inquiry later that month that there appeared to be a \"culture of illegal payments\" to public officials at the Sun. A total of 26 people have been arrested since last July as part of Operation Elveden, which is linked to the Met's investigations into phone and computer hacking. The management and standards committee was set up by Rupert Murdoch's parent company, News Corporation, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World last July to investigate alleged illegal activity by News International journalists. The three people arrested on Thursday have all been released on bail. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
