Arsenal were a goal down to Brighton when their interim coach laid down some home truths in his first match in charge at the Emirates Stadium but could not build on an equaliser from Alexandre Lacazette and were beaten by a late winner from Neal Maupay, meaning they sit five points above the teams in the bottom three and 10 shy of the top four. Ljungberg admitted they had been far off the pace in the first 45 minutes and accepted a lack of confidence is a big concern. \u201cAt half-time we said: \u2018This is not Arsenal, we have to give it a crack\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was tough. We didn\u2019t show up in the first half, didn\u2019t work hard and didn\u2019t want to play. You can\u2019t start like that. \u201cSecond half we had a word and were better but we are suspect on the counter and have no confidence. We gave them 45 minutes at home. I need to work on that and get confidence back into the boys. It\u2019s a concern for any coach, a lack of confidence.\u201d The defeat marked Arsenal\u2019s ninth game without a win and the nerves could be felt throughout the crowd, which received Ljungberg well but was hardly at full volume. \u201cWe need to dig out a win to get some confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the nerves in the crowd affect the players. They are human beings, they want to do well and they feel pressure. But we need a win and we showed in the second half we can get one.\u201d The right-back H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn said he had \u201cthe feeling that, whatever we do, it doesn\u2019t come out right\u201d and bemoaned that \u201cteams score every chance against us\u201d, although Brighton were the better side for long periods. For Graham Potter the win was just reward for a proactive display. \u201cWe didn\u2019t park the bus,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cWe pressed high, we played through from the back. We showed enough quality and character to get the win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
