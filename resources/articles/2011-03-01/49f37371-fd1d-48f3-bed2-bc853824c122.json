There was a time, during England's long procession to World Cup glory under Clive Woodward, when a last-ditch withering of the red rose seemed to be an annual feature of the international calendar. So he is aware that it does not necessarily mean the end of all hope. But England really were pretty dreadful here, inferior to their hosts in virtually every phase of the game. If they are not as bad as they were made to appear on their first visit to the sparkling new Aviva Stadium, nor are they as good as the claims made on their behalf following the victories with which they opened this Six Nations campaign. They deserved exactly what they got and no one was pretending otherwise. Within two minutes Ireland were pushing them back at the first scrummage and forcing an infringement into the bargain. English arrogance off the pitch was rewarded when Jonathan Sexton responded to an isolated and unmannerly bellow of \"Come on, England\" shattering the silence as he prepared to take a first-half penalty by slotting the ball immaculately between the posts. \"We've got no one to blame but ourselves,\" Johnson said. \"In the first half, all the things you need to do against this sort of team in that sort of game, we didn't do them. When you're in a fight you want to land a few and we didn't land any. It's a scar and we'll have to wear it for a little bit.\" The errors, he suggested, are \"what you get from young guys\". Ireland made mistakes, too, but with the exception of the Eoin Reddan pass which Steve Thompson intercepted for a defiant solo try, they made them on the front foot and were able to recover. England were forced to pay the heaviest of prices for their fumbles and misunderstandings. Eight years ago Johnson led his grand slam hunters out on to the wrong patch of turf at Lansdowne Road and refused to budge. On Saturday afternoon he stood and watched, swigging from a bottle of orange juice, as his team huddled during the wait for Ireland to make their way out of the dressing room for the pre-match ceremonies. This time protocol was followed and Mary McAleese, the Irish president, was not forced to repeat the experience of getting mud on her sensible medium-rise heels as she was introduced to the teams. England's nerves were apparent as soon as they had gone 3-0 down to Jonathan Sexton's penalty in the fifth minute, when Alex Corbisiero encroached at the consequent restart. A couple of minutes later Ben Youngs, attempted a typically adventurous and opportunistic dash around the fringe of a ruck, but dropped the ball and saw it clutched by Irish hands. Few aspects of England's development over recent months can have pleased Johnson more than the dynamic, imaginative partnership of the 21-year-old Youngs and the 25-year-old Toby Flood. But there is still a callowness to their work and there was another example of expensive fallibility midway through the first half when David Wallace chased Youngs as he raced away from a ruck on the short side, catching the scrum-half with a challenge that forced the ball from the Englishman's grasp. And when Flood was presented with a straightforward penalty which would have put his side on the scoreboard, he hooked it wide. By the time he succeeded with his next attempt, Ireland were 14 points up, but in the following minutes two of his intended miss-passes \u2013 one under pressure, the other not \u2013 went to ground. Soon Youngs was making his way to the sin-bin for the amazingly stupid crime of throwing the ball into the crowd after Wallace's buccaneering break had been halted near the right-hand corner flag. When the scrum-half's 10 minutes of punishment were up, on the other side of the interval, Danny Care came on to take his place. But no sooner were England back to full strength than they found themselves in complete disarray as Brian O'Driscoll's try took the match beyond their grasp. The Aviva Stadium, as we must call it, looks spectacular from its approaches, like the glass-clad cocoon of some robot-insect. But there is inevitably something antiseptic about new stadiums. Great deeds are needed to seep into the fabric, creating a patina of memory and affection. This was just such a day in Dublin 4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
