There is a yearning to enjoy the season of goodwill with our relatives and yet their proximity often creates friction. For many families, it is the only time of year we get to spend together, yet we resent the stress that this creates. The Covid-19 pandemic will only amplify this angst. It is hard to predict how the situation will change, but it seems unlikely that the second wave will have receded by 25 December. If the virus is still circulating widely, our celebrations will pose a danger and we will have to decide between taking that risk and celebrating alone. Boris Johnson has repeatedly asserted the government will do \u201ceverything we can to make sure that Christmas for everybody is as normal as possible\u201d, yet his chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance echoed the warning of a senior Scottish health official that a \u201cdigital Christmas\u201d cannot be ruled out. Why would we be prepared to put our ourselves and our loved ones at risk for the sake of turkey and charades? These traditions are deeply embedded in our culture, but recent developments in evolutionary psychology suggest the knotty and conflicting emotions they inspire may have deeper origins. While it cannot provide simple solutions to our dilemmas, a knowledge of our evolved instincts may help us to approach Christmas with a little more clarity of thought. According to evolutionary theorists, most of our social connections rely on a sense of reciprocity that brings mutual benefits. In prehistory, we might have shared our food with allies during times of scarcity in the knowledge that they would do the same for us; the balance of give and take is essential for the survival of the relationship. \u201cImplicitly or explicitly, people keep track of favours given to friends, even close friends,\u201d says Dr Samuel Roberts at Liverpool John Moores University. For family members, however, we have an additional motivation for altruism, arising from an evolutionary process known as \u201ckin selection\u201d. This theory, popularised in Richard Dawkins\u2019s book The Selfish Gene, centres on the fact that our close relatives \u2013 our siblings, nieces, nephews and grandchildren \u2013 share many of our genes. By aiding our nearest kin, we can therefore protect part of our genetic lineage. \u201cIn evolutionary terms, I can pass on my genes through my own kids or by helping out my sister and her kids,\u201d says Roberts. This means we have evolved an instinctual urge to care more about family members than friends, even if we share little in common besides our genes \u2013 and we don\u2019t keep such a close watch on the reciprocal give and take. Although the theory of kin selection may seem too cynical and simplistic to explain human behaviour, there is strong evidence it drives many of our feelings and actions. Working with Robin Dunbar and Oliver Curry at the University of Oxford, Roberts asked more than 100 participants to state how prepared they would be to donate a kidney to 12 different people within their social network, as well as rating the \u201cemotional closeness\u201d of each relationship. For people outside the family, the willingness to donate was intimately connected to their feelings of friendship; the greater their sense of affinity, the more likely they would be to give the organ. The participants were, however, much keener to donate to a family member and this was true even when the researchers factored in those feelings of emotional closeness, suggesting that the sheer fact of their relatedness was driving their altruism. Roberts has since shown this \u201ckinship premium\u201d is also evident in more regular displays of devotion, such as the distance we are willing to travel to see someone. For more distant relatives, a second cousin, say, the ratings of emotional closeness were the predominant factor in determining how much participants were willing to invest in a long drive, train journey or flight. For more immediate family members, however, the feelings of emotional closeness could only partly explain the link. People were willing to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d if it meant spending time with the people who shared a higher proportion of their genes, even if they might have actually had more fun with their friends. It\u2019s not hard to imagine how kin selection applies to a typical holiday gathering: our evolved instinct to maintain our family relationships pulls us together, year after year, despite our different opinions on politics or the best way to cook a turkey. And the networks are so tightly entwined you can\u2019t simply avoid the most annoying members: you are bound together through all your mutual relations. As Roberts says: \u201cYou choose friends who are similar to you, but you can\u2019t choose your family.\u201d Confronting those differences may be stressful, but from an evolutionary point of view, it is the act of turning up and showing our continued investment in these bonds that really matters. Kin selection can\u2019t, however, explain our behaviour in 2020, when many are considering whether to go ahead with celebrations despite the known dangers. One recent analysis showed that the chance of catching Covid-19 from an infected member of the same household is about 19% (and that newly infected person may then, of course, pass it on to someone else in the family). Surely any action that might threaten our own lives, and those of our kin, should be at odds with all those evolved instincts? The problem, says Dr Tegan Cruwys at Australia National University in Canberra, is that many people intuitively believe their families will be less likely to carry the virus than strangers. \u201cThe reality is that we are prepared to take much greater risks with the people we live with, with our closest friends and families \u2013 even in a non-Covid context,\u201d she says. To understand why this is the case, we need to consider the ways we might have assessed risk in prehistory. Our ancestors did not have the science to explain how something such as the coronavirus could be transmitted between people, but they had evolved some basic rules of thumb that would help them to tune their sense of danger and one involved group membership. In prehistory, outsiders may have brought many threats, including the possibility of new infections, meaning that we are less trustful of people who are not part of our in-group and more trustful of people with whom we share a sense of identity. Cruwys has found that subtle interventions to manipulate people\u2019s sense of group membership can have a powerful effect on the way they perceive risk. In one study, published earlier this year, her team first gave the participants a test of colour perception. Based on the results of the test, they were subsequently divided into two groups \u2013 \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d \u2013 depending on supposed differences in their perception. (In reality, the assignment was random.) The participants were then asked to make a Lego model, a task that was supposed to test their spatial awareness. At the table, they found a few crumpled tissues, ostensibly left behind by a previous participant who had a cold. Rationally speaking, that person\u2019s colour perception \u2013 whether they were identified as a \u201cred\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d person \u2013 should have had no effect on the risk of contagion. Yet Cruwys found that they estimated the risk to be much greater if they were told that the previous participant had come from the opposite group than if they were told that they had fallen in the same group. In more natural settings, such as student parties or festivals, Cruwys has found that sharing a sense of identity with someone can affect things such as our sharing of drinks or engaging in unprotected sex with the other partygoers. If people felt more of a shared identity with someone, they tended to imagine that the risk of these activities would be much lower. Cruwys\u2019s most recent (currently unpublished) research shows that our sense of social identity and group membership has already had a serious impact on people\u2019s behaviour in the pandemic. She has found, for example, that a sense of community has caused people to underestimate the contagion risk. \u201cThe more people identified with the other people in their neighbourhood pre-Covid, the less likely they were to perceive their neighbourhood as a Covid risk, and the less frightened they were of catching it during the lockdown,\u201d she says. Our families, of course, represent our most salient group; our \u201cclan\u201d is enshrined in our surnames and is one of the first things we present to anyone else. In Cruwys\u2019s view, this may explain why we underestimate the potential dangers of a family gathering. \u201cThere are lots of people Googling things like \u2018how do I make sure I don\u2019t get Covid if a runner goes past me on the path?\u2019, but not so many people are asking how to celebrate a birthday safely,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s completely contrary to what the data say about who you\u2019re most likely to catch it from.\u201d Given these findings, she thinks public health messaging should be more tightly focused on domestic situations, where the risk is highest but also least recognised. Assuming that the virus is still prevalent in the population, and that there is not a total lockdown, there are a few measures that we might take to reduce contagion, such as reducing the size of the family gatherings, avoiding hugs, meeting outside or wearing masks inside the home. That won\u2019t be easy to stomach, of course \u2013 it will be unsettling to spend the holidays this way. But Cruwys thinks health authorities could encourage more careful behaviour if they emphasise the fact that these measures are themselves an act of love and concern. Roberts\u2019s research, meanwhile, might offer some reassurance that, whatever happens, our connections will endure. In a series of studies, he has examined how various relationships change over time. While our friendships tend to weaken without regular contact, he has found that most family bonds remain strong after prolonged absences. \u201cThey are much more durable,\u201d he says. The seismic shifts of 2020 will be hard to live through, but they will not be strong enough to uproot the family tree.
