The article formed the introduction to Son of Bitch, a book of photographs (with a very un-Wodehousian title) by Elliott Erwitt. Perhaps press times precluded it but no mention is made that Wodehouse had died just a few weeks earlier. Wodehouse is pictured with his one-year-old stray, Boy, at his home on Long Island. \u2018There is not a sitter in his gallery who does not melt the heart,\u2019 he writes about Erwitt\u2019s pictures. \u2018And no beastly class distinctions, either. Thoroughbred or mutts, they are all here.\u2019 A colleague gave him his first dog, a French bulldog named Sammy, \u2018as amiable, and sweet-natured an animal as ever broke biscuit\u2019. But when Sammy died, confesses Wodehouse, \u2018I made what I think was a mistake by appointing as his successor an Aberdeen terrier who was supposed (though he seldom did) to answer to the name of Angus\u2026 Angus had a way of standing in front of me and looking at me like a Scottish preacher about to rebuke the sins of his congregation.\u2019 One can only marvel over the following sentences \u2013 the first for its parenthetical descent and the second for being appallingly funny. \u2018Over Bill, the foxhound, even Mr Erwitt, broadminded though he is, would, I\u2019m afraid, have shaken his head. Bill was a stray in the last stages of starvation and so covered with ticks that only the keenest eye could detect that there was a dog underneath.\u2019 Finally, he considers the \u2018hotly debated\u2019 question of whether dogs have a sense of humour. \u2018My own opinion is that some have and some don\u2019t. Dachshunds have, but not St Bernards and Great Danes. Apparently a dog has to be small to be fond of a joke. You never find an Irish wolfhound trying to be a stand-up comic.\u2019 Just perfect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
