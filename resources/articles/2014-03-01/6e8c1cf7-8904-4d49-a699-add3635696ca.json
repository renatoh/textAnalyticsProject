Ukraine is pulling its forces out of Crimea, acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Monday, in the face of what he called \"threats to the lives and health of our service personnel\" and their families. It came after Russian troops took over a Ukrainian naval base in Feodosia, Crimea, one of the few military facilities still flying a Ukrainian flag. The G7 nations have suspended their 16-year collaboration with Russia until Moscow \"changes course\" over Ukraine and threatened intensified sanctions in the event of any Russian military moves in the region. In a move intended to underline Russian isolation, leaders from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan met in The Hague as the G7 for the first time since Russia was first brought into the group in 1998 to seal east-west co-operation. The joint statement, which is being called the 'Hague Declaration', said they would not attend a planned G8 summit in Sochi in June but would convene in Brussels instead. The group's foreign ministers would also boycott a planned meeting in Moscow in April. A bill providing economic assistance to Ukraine and imposing sanctions over Russia's seizure of Crimea cleared a procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate on Monday, as backers attempted to win passage of the legislation. Nato's most senior military commander has said that Russia had amassed a large military force on Ukraine's eastern border, and warned that Moldova's separatist Trans-Dniester region could be the Kremlin's next target. We are wrapping up the blog for now. Despite a stalled stalled US aid package for Ukraine finally beginning to emerge from Congress, a wider package which also includes further sanctions against Russia still faces an uphill struggle in the House of Representatives. The Guardian's Dan Roberts reports that Republican senator John McCain warned that further delays would fuel a Russian perception that the US was not serious about helping Ukraine resist further territorial aggression. McCain urged: Pass this legislation as soon as possible and fight about less important issues later on. If we get hung up for another week because of our failure to act it sends exactly the wrong signals. I believe [Putin] is watching carefully for the reaction of the West and how we are going to assist the Ukraine. A bill providing economic assistance to Ukraine and imposing sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine has cleared a procedural hurdle in the US Senate, as backers attempted to win passage of the legislation later this week. Reuters reports: By a vote of 78-17, the Senate laid the groundwork for debating a bill that would back a $1 billion loan guarantee for the government in Kiev, provide $150 million in aid for Ukraine and neighboring countries and require sanctions on Russians and Ukrainians responsible for corruption, human rights abuses or undermining stability in Ukraine. The Guardian's Julian Borger has been sketching out the scene today in the Hague, where he says that the Dutch hosts have sought to move away from their tendency at previous summits of playing up the supposedly quirky, unconventional nature of their country. He also writes that Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, had told journalists that he looked forward to meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for the first time to talk peace and maybe even have a vodka together. Julian adds: Within half an hour, half his wish was granted. A picture was issued by the Russian foreign minister showing the two men staring grimly across a bare white table, with small flags, white flowers and mineral water between them. No vodka and, going by the body language, no closer to peace, either. Ukraine is hoping the UN General Assembly will adopt a resolution later this week reaffirming the country's unity and territorial integrity and underscoring that the referendum that led to Crimea's annexation by Russia \"has no validity.\" The draft resolution, circulated Monday to the 193 assembly members and obtained by the Associated Press (AP), never mentions Russia by name but calls on all countries not to recognize \"any alteration of the status\" of Crimea. AP reports: [The draft resolution] also urges all parties to pursue a peaceful resolution of the situation in Ukraine, \"refrain from unilateral actions and inflammatory rhetoric that may increase tensions, and to engage fully with international mediation efforts.\" The General Assembly's resolutions are not legally binding but they reflect world opinion, and Ukraine will be looking for a strong \"yes\" vote to show Russia's international isolation. The U.N.'s most powerful body, the Security Council, has been blocked from taking any action because Russia, has veto power as one of its five permanent members. Even so, the 15-member council has held eight meetings on Ukraine, as Western powers strive to keep up the pressure on Moscow. The Guardian's Richard Norton Taylor has written a critique of the call by General (now Lord) Richard Dannatt, former head of the British army, for western diplomacy to be backed up by greater military capability. Richard writes that British generals, past and present, are deeply unhappy about the government's decision to cut the regular army by 20%, from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020. He suggests, however: A threat of deploying British soldiers against Russian forces (500 are being sent on a Nato exercise in the Baltic) may be a slightly more realistic deterrent than a Trident long-range nuclear ballistic missile, but it will not help to prevent more violent ethnic disputes along the national state borders of central and eastern Europe. Far from it. You can read the piece in full here. As always, the diplomacy is likely to continue over dinner. Willem-Alexander, is hosting 53 world leaders who have been taking part in the Nuclear Security Summit. Despite the G7's serious criticism of Russia, and their threat of imposing damaging economic sanctions, opportunities for communication remain open. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is among those attending. Commentators have digesting the (by now widely circulated) G7 declaration and its potential consequences. Mark Knoller, White House Correspondent at CBS News, sums up what he believes to be its grim significance: Matt Lee, diplomatic writer at the Associated Press, suggests that Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, won't be displeased about the statement, which is called after the Dutch city where G7 leaders had been meeting. He also recalls a 1994 political agreement seeking to provide assurances relating to Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons The British foreign Secretary, William Hague, has described the cancellation of the G8 meeting this year as \"a huge blow\" and suggested that it would be hard to revive the relationship with Russia. He said: It would need our values to be clear, our shared values to be clear again, and clearly those shared values are not shared by Russia in violating the independence and territorial integrity of a neighbouring nation state. This is the G7 this year and we will see how long it takes to change that in the future. Hague also highlighted the focus on energy issues as potentially \"changing the balance of leverage between Russia and the European Union\" and acknowledged that tougher sanctions would mean \"many countries bear the cost of that in many ways\" but \"we have to be prepared to do that\". He added: Every country would have to do what is necessary if more far-reaching sanctions were applied, accepting that that would affect different economies in different ways. The United Kingdom is certainly prepared to do that. There is nothing that other countries in Europe have proposed that we have blocked. The United Kingdom is fully prepared to play its full part. The declaration's final point backs financial support to the faltering economy of Ukraine, saying: The International Monetary Fund has a central role leading the international effort to support Ukrainian reform, lessening Ukraine\u2019s economic vulnerabilities, and better integrating the country as a market economy in the multilateral system. We strongly support the IMF\u2019s work with the Ukrainian authorities and urge them to reach a rapid conclusion. IMF support will be critical in unlocking additional assistance from the World Bank, other international financial institutions, the EU, and bilateral sources. We remain united in our commitment to provide strong financial backing to Ukraine, to coordinate our technical assistance and to provide assistance in other areas, including measures to enhance trade and strengthen energy security. However, that point is followed by the G7's formal announcement that it is suspending participation in the G8 until.. .. Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion and will meet again in G-7 format at the same time as planned, in June 2014, in Brussels, to discuss the broad agenda we have together. We have also advised our Foreign Ministers not to attend the April meeting in Moscow. In addition, we have decided that G-7 Energy Ministers will meet to discuss ways to strengthen our collective energy security. The G7's 'Hague Declaration' does make some attempt to reach out to Russia. In point five of the eight-point statement, it says that Russia's support for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine is \"a step in the right direction.\" It adds: We look forward to the mission\u2019s early deployment, in order to facilitate the dialogue on the ground, reduce tensions and promote normalization of the situation, and we call on all parties to ensure that Special Monitoring Mission members have safe and secure access throughout Ukraine to fulfill their mandate. A US official has told Reuters that Russian intervention into southern or eastern Ukraine would be the clearest trigger for additional sanctions, or violence in Crimea. A joint statement, which is being called \"The Hague Declaration\", has been released by G7 leaders (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. It reaffirms G7 support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence and warns that Russia's actions will have \"significant consequences\". It adds of Russia's actions: This clear violation of international law is a serious challenge to the rule of law around the world and should be a concern for all nations. In response to Russia\u2019s violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to demonstrate our determination to respond to these illegal actions, individually and collectively we have imposed a variety of sanctions against Russia and those individuals and entities responsible. We remain ready to intensify actions including coordinated sectoral sanctions that will have an increasingly significant impact on the Russian economy, if Russia continues to escalate this situation. You can read the full text here at the European Commission's website. Here's a pic of the statement (via a tweet from Time political reporter Zeke Miller) as it looks: Diplomatic sources speaking on behalf of G7 leaders have been providing further briefings, telling Reuters that G7 leaders \"remain ready to intensify action against Russia, including taking \"coordinated sanctions\". Russia's foreign minister has been shrugging off the threat of exclusion from meetings of the world's largest industrial countries and the suspension of the G8, saying that Moscow was \"not clinging to\" membership of what he described as an informal group. Sergei Lavrov was speaking minutes after his first meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Deshchytsia, at the margins of the global nuclear security summit in The Hague, from where my colleague Julian Borger has sent this report. Lavrov said that he would maintain contacts with the authorities in Kiev, but gave no sign of any breakthrough in the impasse over the future of Crimea. He drew a comparison between Crimea and Kosovo and asked whether the west wanted \"blood to [be] shed\" in the same way. Western diplomats said they expected a joint statement leaders from the G7 industrialised countries, dissolving the G8 group, which has provided a forum for contacts between the western industrialised world and Russia since 1998. However, Lavrov presented the threat as insignificant, saying: The G8 is an informal club, with no formal membership, so no one can be expelled from it....Its raison d'etre was for deliberations between western industrialised countries and Russia, but there are other fora for that now \u2026 so if our western partners say there is no future for that format, then so be it. We are not clinging to that format. This is Ben Quinn taking over the blog now. Here's a roundup of the latest developments around Ukraine, Crimea and Russia: \u2022 Ukraine has withdrawn all its troops from Crimea, after Russia launched another attack on a military base there. Reports said Russian troops used helicopters and stun grenades to take over the Feodosia naval base. The Ukrainian defence ministry said between 60 and 80 marines were captured by the Russians. Russia says its flag is now flying over 189 military institutions in Crimea. \u2022 The G7 leaders, meeting in the Hague, have said this year's G8 meeting \u2013 to be held in Sochi in June \u2013 is cancelled, in the wake of what the White House called Russia's \"flagrant\" violation of international law. The G7 leaders are meeting to discuss the possible permanent expulsion of Russia from the Group of Eight. \u2022 Russia has banned 13 Canadians from entering its territory, in a retaliatory move following Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper's visit to Kiev at the weekend. One, Liberal MP Chrystia Freeland, said \"it's an honour to be on Putin's sanction list\". \u2022 Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has met US secretary of state John Kerry in the Hague, on the fringes of the Nuclear Security Summit attended by world leaders. The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has backed Russia's annexation of Crimea, saying a much-criticised referendum on its future reflected its people's \"free will\" to decide their future, reports Emma Graham-Harrison: It was an unexpected move from a man who has little stake in Ukraine's future, spent years fighting to evict Soviet forces from his own country, and now leads a democracy funded largely by the western nations that have slapped sanctions on Moscow. However, Karzai has always been keen to counter accusations that he is a foreign puppet, and more recently has been at odds with the United States over everything from air strikes and the forthcoming presidential election to the recent release of dozens of prisoners captured by foreign troops. He may also be looking to strengthen regional ties, at a time when western interest in Afghanistan is fading and with it the funds the government needs to pay the army and keep the country running. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has inspected military bases in Crimea today, the most senior Russian official to visit the region since it was annexed by Moscow, Reuters reports: Shoigu, one of President Vladimir Putin's longest serving ministers and closest allies, was shown by Russian television station NTV meeting with Ukrainian officers who defected to the side of pro-Russian local authorities. \"The most important thing is that there not be any interim period when there is an absence of authority so that military hardware does not fall into the wrong hands,\" Shoigu told military commanders. One of the 13 Canadians on the sanctions list issued today by Russia is Chrystia Freeland, Liberal MP for Toronto Central, who was previously a reporter working in Ukraine the Financial Times, Washington Post, and The Economist; and the FT's Moscow bureau chief. She has now been banned from entering Russia. Grod is Paul Grod, president of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. Cotler is Irwin Cotler, another Liberal MP. More on the cancellation of this summer's G8 meeting in Sochi, as the G7 leaders meet in the Hague to discuss the possible expulsion of Russia from the Group of Eight. The White House has said that, as long as Russia continues \"flagrantly\" to violate international law, \"there is no need for it to engage with the G7\". David Cameron, who earlier announced that the June meeting would not take place, told reporters: We should be clear there's not going to be a G8 summit this year in Russia. That's absolutely clear.\ufeff Russia needs to change course. We need to send a very clear message to President Putin that it would be completely unacceptable to send more troops into Ukraine. Britain is showing its support for Latvia and Lithuania as David Lidington, the Europe minister, embarks on a two day visit to the two Baltic States on Monday. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIt is an opportunity to underline our commitment to those countries.\u201d There will be no G8 summit in Russia this year, David Cameron said today. The meeting was planned for June in Sochi, which staged the Winter Olympics earlier this year. The Canadians prohibited from entering Russia include aides to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and members of parliament, and the head of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, Paul Grod, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. It said the move was in response to the \"unacceptable action by the Canadian side that has inflicted serious damage to bilateral relations\", but insisted Russia was open to \"constructive\" cooperation with Canada. The list, Associated Press reports, includes Harper's aides Christine Hogan and Wayne Wouters; the House of Commons speaker Andrew Scheer; Peter Van Loan, the government leader in the house; Senator Raynell Andreychuk; and other lawmakers. Russia's foreign ministry has announced that it is imposing retaliatory sanctions on 13 Canadian officials, lawmakers and public figures, according to Reuters. The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, visited Kiev on Saturday. Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail reported that he \"stood shoulder to shoulder with [Ukraine prime minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk and forcefully rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin\". The newspaper called Harper \"the most vocal advocate of expelling Russia from the Group of Eight [G8]\". Canada has, according to that report, the third largest Ukrainian population in the world. The Globe and Mail had previously reported fears among Canadian businesses over possible retaliatory sanctions: Leaders of Canadian companies operating in Russia are fearful that Western sanctions \u2013 and Ottawa\u2019s overtly pro-Ukrainian position over Crimea \u2013 will lead to a worsening business environment for them here. Canada has not only joined the United States and European Union in slapping sanctions on Russian officials following Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea, Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government has been more outspoken in its support for Kiev \u2013 and criticism of Moscow \u2013 than any other Western country. Britain is to join forces with its Nato allies to help bolster defences of the Baltic states amid fears that Moscow may use the presence of substantial Russian minorities to destabilise Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, Nicholas Watt reports. As Downing Street indicated that the leaders of the G7 countries are likely to punish Moscow for its annexation of Crimea by mothballing the larger G8, which includes Russia, the prime minister said Nato would send a \"very clear message\" to show it believes in the security of all its members. Cameron said: I think what is important is that we send a very clear message to our Nato partners and allies that we believe in Nato and we believe in their security. That's why, for instance, we're helping some of the Baltic states with their defence and their needs. That's what we should be doing and that's what we're very much committed to doing. As world leaders \u2013 though not Vladimir Putin \u2013 meet in the Hague for the Nuclear Security Summit, Obama has met with Chinese president Xi Jinping as part of his efforts to gather international support for pressure on Russia. As my colleague Dan Roberts has reported, the White House is anxious to lure Beijing away from its historic support of Moscow: Despite fears that the Ukrainian crisis marks a return to a Cold War-style standoff between East and West, the White House had drawn succour from a Chinese decision to to abstain rather than vote with Russia during a United Nations vote condemning events in Crimea last Sunday. Obama meet[s] president Xi Jinping in the Hague on Monday on the sidelines of a wider summit on combating nuclear terrorism. Michelle Obama and her two daughters are currently on a visit to China that is billed as a form of \u201csoft diplomacy\u201d by the White House. Leaders meeting in the Hague for the Nuclear Security Summit will today discuss excluding Russia from the G8, my colleague Andrew Sparrow reports from the Number 10 lobby briefing: Downing Street said that world leaders will discuss excluding Russia from the G8 at a meeting in the Hague this afternoon. David Cameron and other leaders are in the Hague for a meeting of the Nuclear Security Summit and at 5.30pm they will meet as the G7 to discuss the situation in Ukraine. The prime minister's spokesman said this was the first meeting of G7 heads of government since the G7 was turned into the G8 when Russia was included in 1998. He said the fact that the meeting was taking place was \"part of a clear message that is being sent to the Russian government\". He went on: All the preparatory work for the G8 meeting at Sochi has been suspended. I'm sure the future of the G grouping is probably the main item for their discussion later this afternoon. The spokesman also said that, in the light of events in Ukraine, Cameron thought it was right for work to be done at the EU level on preparing what further measures might need to be taken against Russia. But the spokesman said that, although the storming of Ukrainian military bases on Crimea by Russian soldiers was seen as a failure to de-escalate the crisis, it was not viewed as further de-stabilisation \u2013 the threshold set by the EU as justifying further anti-Russia measures, involving full economic and trade sanctions. The politics live blog is here. The Group of Seven (G7) countries are the US, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Tweets from the account of Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev have this morning been focused on imminent governmental changes in newly annexed Crimea: David Cameron has responded to Lord Dannatt's call for an increase in UK troop numbers. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has the prime minister's comments in full on the politics blog. But the gist of it is this: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to change our plans to base British soldiers in Britain but I think what is important is that we send a very clear message to our Nato partners and allies that we believe in Nato and we believe in their security. Russia's takeover of the Feodosia naval base was launched before dawn on Monday and involved armoured personnel carriers and stun grenades, AFP reports: The Ukrainian defence ministry said Russian paratroopers were lowered on to the Feodosia naval base from four helicopters in a commando-style operation in which guns were fired in the air and stun grenades strewn across the facility. Several military trucks were seen leaving the base less than two hours later with some Ukrainian marines whose hands had been tied. The Ukrainian statement said two commanders were injured when they were kicked in the face before being taken away in a helicopter in an unknown direction. The ministry later said that between \"60 to 80 marines were captured\" in violation of a prior agreement with the Russians. The base in Feodosia housed Ukraine's only marine battalion. The country's marine union said it was home to an elite unit that was part of the navy. Ukrainian marine officer First Lieutenant Anatoly Mozgovoy, who was in the Feodosia compound, told reporters that the Russians had fired shots and the Ukrainian soldiers were unarmed. Asked if the base had been taken over, he said: \"Yes.\" \"The invading troops were using stun grenades and also firing automatic weapons. The interior of the compound is full of Russian troops,\" said Vladislav Seleznyov, a Ukrainian military spokesman in Crimea. Some more details on the decision by Ukrainian authorities to withdraw troops from Crimea, as Ukraine's acting president Oleksandr Turchynov said on television that all servicemen and their families would be relocated to the mainland. The national security and defence council has reached a decision, under instructions from the defence ministry, to conduct a redeployment of military units stationed in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The cabinet of ministers has instructions to resettle the families of soldiers as well as everyone else who today is forced to leave their homes under the pressure and aggression of the Russian army's occupying forces. Despite the enormous losses, the Ukrainian soldiers in Crimea did their duty. Most importantly, they gave the Ukrainian armed forces the opportunity to prepare their defences, to put the military on full combat alert, and to launch a partial mobilisation. Crimea's pro-Kremlin deputy premier Rustam Temirgaliyev had a slightly different take on it, saying: All Ukrainian soldiers have either switched to the Russian side or are leaving the territory of the Crimea. Russia says its flag is now flying over 189 military institutions in Crimea President Obama, who's in Amsterdam, has been speaking about the situation in Crimea, at the start of several days of talks with European leaders that are expected to be dominated by events in Ukraine and possible sanctions against Russia. On Monday morning, at the Rijksmuseum, Obama said: Europe and America are united in our support of the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people. We are united in imposing a cost on Russia for its actions so far. Prime Minister Rutte [the Dutch PM] rightly pointed out yesterday the growing sanctions would bring significant consequences to the Russian economy and I\u2019ll be meeting with my fellow G7 leaders later today. The Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, has spoken today about the need to ensure energy and water supplies for the newly annexed region of Crimea, which is currently heavily reliant on Ukraine for both: 80% of its electricity supplies, 85% of its water and a large part of its gas comes from Ukraine. Reuters reports that Medvedev told a ministerial meeting on Monday: \"This issue needs to be decided through international negotiations \u2026 We need to choose the best way to supply the peninsula.\" The dependence of some European economies on gas supplies from Russia has led some commentators to wonder if Obama will find support for his push for tougher sanctions against Putin. Russia provides almost a third of the EU's gas needs and 40% of it is shipped through Ukraine. \"Europeans are committed to do something,\" said Jeffrey Mankoff, a Russian analyst at the Center for Strategic International Studies. \"I think it'll be difficult to convince them to go anywhere near where the United States would like to go.\" The former head of the British army has said the country should reconsider plans to cut back its armed forces in the face of a \"resurgent\" Russia. Lord Dannatt, who was chief of the general staff from 2006 to 2008, writes in the Telegraph: The Russian takeover of Crimea may not have been conducted to Vladimir Putin\u2019s timing, but it certainly suits his agenda and aspirations. Whether his ambition reaches into eastern Ukraine or elsewhere, only he knows. However, with a resurgent Russia, this is a poor moment for the US-led West to be weak in resolve and muscle. Diplomacy and sanctions may be the right response for now to the Russian president, but he will look beyond those things to see where the real check on his actions might come from. The UK government is cutting the regular army from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel by 2020, as well as withdrawing all 20,000 troops from its bases in Germany \u2013 ending the British army's 70-year presence there. It ought instead to be increasing army numbers, Dannatt argues: An additional 3,000 regular soldiers would provide an extra deployable brigade \u2013 a useful increase in capability in itself, sending the signal that Britain takes its defence responsibilities seriously \u2026 Were we to keep that additional brigade stationed in Germany, it would further underline our commitment to peace and security.\ufeff You can read the full Guardian report on this story here. Reuters has more on the Ukrainian move to withdraw its troops from Crimean bases: Ukraine is pulling its forces out of Crimea in the face of threats and pressure from the Russian military, acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Monday. Turchinov, speaking in parliament after Russian troops entered a key Ukrainian marine base near Feodosia, crowning a gradual take-over of Ukrainian military facilities on the peninsula, said the decision had been taken in the face of \"threats to the lives and health of our service personnel\" and their families. \"The National Defence and Security Council has instructed the Defence Ministry to carry out a re-deployment of military units in Crimea and carry out the evacuation of their families,\" he said.\ufeff Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments in Ukraine. Here's a summary of today's news so far and what to expect as President Barack Obama arrives in the Netherlands to meet European leaders to discuss the crisis in Crimea. \u2022 Ukraine is pulling its forces out of Crimea, acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Monday, in the face of what he called \"threats to the lives and health of our service personnel\" and their families. \u2022 It came after Russian troops took over a Ukrainian naval base in Feodosia, Crimea, one of the few military facilities that was still flying a Ukrainian flag. \u2022 Barack Obama has arrived in the Netherlands for talks with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries, to try to persuade them to increase pressure on Russia. \u2022 Nato's most senior military commander has said that Russia had amassed a large military force on Ukraine's eastern border, and warned that Moldova's separatist Trans-Dniester region could be the Kremlin's next target."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
