The Group C finale on Tuesday presents Northern Ireland with a formidable hurdle and an opportunity to reach the last 16 of their inaugural European Championship in stunning fashion. It will be the second time O\u2019Neill has watched Joachim L\u00f6w at work at a European tournament but a far cry from the first. After Ch\u00e2teau de Pizay and an overnight stay in the French capital, Northern Ireland will receive a police escort to Parc des Princes in their personalised, luxury coach before confronting the world champions. It was somewhat different for their manager at Euro 2012 when, keen to watch their World Cup-qualifying opponents Russia and Portugal in competitive action, he paid his own way to attend Germany\u2019s game against the latter in Lviv. \u201cMe and a friend hired a car in Poland,\u201d O\u2019Neill recollects. \u201cWe flew from Belfast to Krakow \u2013 easyJet \u2013 and that was a great base for us but we signed an insurance waiver at the airport to say we wouldn\u2019t take the car out of Poland. So when we got to the border in Ukraine we couldn\u2019t go across. We were a bit stuck. \u2018What do we do?\u2019 That border\u2019s not like Newry is today, there were checkpoints and all that, loads. We\u2019d a brainwave when we saw a bus with Germany fans. Lots of people were staying in Poland and going across to Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s about 50-60 kilometres to Lviv and we approached this wee bus. My mate tried to explain what we were doing and who I was, so that we could get on. The Germany fans didn\u2019t know who I was; I was only in the job about six months, so when we got on they started to Google me and \u2018Northern Ireland manager\u2019 to see who I was. I didn\u2019t have accreditation or anything \u2013 I\u2019d not gone through the IFA \u2013 we just wanted to go on our own steam. We\u2019d our own tickets. I wanted to go to the tournament and sample it, see what it\u2019s about. I wanted to see Russia and Portugal and I saw them both twice. \u201cWe went to Warsaw, too, and Wroclaw. I saw some great games. It was a great experience. Now everywhere we go we\u2019ve got police security \u2013 but that\u2019s nice, we belong in this tournament. I sampled that one, now we\u2019re in this one and we\u2019re part of it.\u201d There may be Germany fans inside Parc des Princes who recognise their former travelling companion as the manager who, like Northern Ireland\u2019s rise from 96th to 25th in Fifa\u2019s rankings since the last European Championship, has gone up in the world these past four years. That Northern Ireland have a chance of reaching the last 16 owes much to O\u2019Neill\u2019s boldness and judgment with his team selection against Ukraine. The 2-0 win and outstanding team performance followed the manager\u2019s decision to make five changes to the side who started the opening defeat by Poland, including the omission of his leading striker. His was a pre-emptive strike, not reactive, but O\u2019Neill denies Ukraine represented the biggest call of his managerial career. The Northern Ireland manager insists: \u201cI didn\u2019t see it like that, I didn\u2019t feel that way at all. We had to win a game and we had to put a team together that could do that. I was always planning to play a back four in the second game, that was always my intention. \u201cAgainst Poland the threat was going to be [Robert] Lewandowski and [Arkadiusz] Milik and we dealt with Lewandowski. They\u2019ve a front two. I was disappointed with certain aspects of how we played against Poland but we lost 1-0 \u2026 1-0. Against Ukraine it was about getting the right personnel and shape. Jonny Evans went to be left-back and he was brilliant. I picked the right team. The decisions on leaving players out had no bearing on it. It was who I picked. Why we left out those we left out, it\u2019s never personal; in fact sometimes it\u2019s not even down to performance and in this case it wasn\u2019t performance-related. The question I\u2019d to ask was: what do we need? The big thing I felt we needed was to get some running power into the team and we did. The thing is, you can lose a bit of size by doing that. There are always many things to consider.\u201d The image of O\u2019Neill celebrating Niall McGinn\u2019s stoppage-time goal against Ukraine \u2013 mid-air in the rain \u2013 captured to perfection the emotion of Northern Ireland\u2019s first win at a major tournament for 34 years. \u201cI\u2019ve had all the usual stick,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople sending me the picture with all the usual lines underneath. But it was great, a great night for Northern Ireland football. What we\u2019ve to do now against Germany is keep the momentum from that performance and if we can, try to produce an even better performance that will get us the result we need to go through. If you can get through on three points then goals conceded or scored will probably be the difference.\u201d A second tournament victory since 1982 will guarantee progress from a daunting group for Northern Ireland. A point should suffice and even defeat by Germany may secure one of the four third-place finishes depending on results elsewhere. Goal difference, in the event of the world champions clicking into gear at this tournament, may also be something to consider in Paris. \u201cThat\u2019s the tricky thing with this scenario,\u201d O\u2019Neill admits. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll know a bit more about other groups by the time we play. Going into these last group games, only two teams are out \u2013 Ukraine and Romania. People said that the format wouldn\u2019t work and that it would be a dilution of the tournament. But the third-place element has kept groups alive. I think it\u2019s enhanced the tournament. If you get the top two in the group qualified after two games, then the third game can have nothing on it. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to try to second-guess games and outcomes. In some groups there are teams who look to have not many points but they\u2019re playing the bottom team \u2013 we\u2019re playing the world champions. We are going out to win but we must try not to lose. We are in control of ourselves, the other games we\u2019re not in control of, we can\u2019t do anything if someone wins or loses 4-0 or 5-0. The only game we can control is our game. We\u2019ve got to the last game in the group with something to play for. We\u2019re facing Germany in Paris. What a great night for football in Northern Ireland. We\u2019ve achieved that goal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
