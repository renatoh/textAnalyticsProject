Di Venuto and his fellow Australian Marcus North, who came together with Derbyshire on 53 for two and still 93 in arrears, had cleared the deficit and were nudging towards a position of strength when the opener called for a risky single to Vikram Solanki's right hand at mid-on. The Worcestershire captain threw down the middle stump and his team again sniffed the win that would consolidate their position in the top two promotion places and close the gap on the leaders Surrey. Six overs later Zaheer Khan, whose bowling had previously been as sloppy as his fielding, won an lbw appeal against Hassan Adnan and Derbyshire were very much on the back foot. North survived and will resume today on 79 in his last innings as an overseas locum before Travis Birt returns from playing in the Top End series for Australia A. But Derbyshire are effectively 76 for four and, with the pitch now as placid as the outfield is rapid, Worcestershire will fancy their chances in a run chase. If they do win, Steven Davies will deserve much of the credit. The 20-year-old left-hander from Bromsgrove confirmed the batting ability that has him earmarked as a future England wicketkeeper in extending his overnight 59 into a third century in only his 22nd first-class match. The bowling was not particularly testing but Davies's technique and temperament were thoroughly impressive as he shared a sixth-wicket stand of 165 with Gareth Batty, whose 79 was a reminder of the all-round qualities that used to interest England before the emergence of Jamie Dalrymple. Both of them were athletically caught and bowled by Ant Botha, Derbyshire's South African left-arm spinner who took four of the last five Worcestershire wickets for figures of six for 117. Derbyshire then lost Steve Stubbings in the last over before lunch without reducing their arrears of 146, as Matt Mason followed his five-wicket first-innings haul by finding a little extra lift from the pitch to have the left-hander caught in the gully. Worcestershire's spinners always seemed likely to be the harder to play and so it proved when Batty had Chris Taylor caught off bat and pad with Derbyshire 143 behind. However, Di Venuto seemed to have them mastered, until three figures beckoned. It was the third time the Tasmanian has fallen in the nervous nineties this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
