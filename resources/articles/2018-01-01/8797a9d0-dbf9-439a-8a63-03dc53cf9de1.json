Antonio Conte had envisaged selecting Barkley among his substitutes for the FA Cup third-round replay at Stamford Bridge with a view to the 24-year-old playing his first competitive football of the campaign. Yet the Chelsea club secretary, David Barnard, pointed out that the England international had completed his \u00a315m move from Everton after the midday cut-off on the day before the original tie at Carrow Road. Competition rules stipulate players must be eligible for the original fixture if they are to feature in a replay. \u201cI found out two days ago, when David told Carlo [Cudicini, the assistant coach], who informed me about this situation,\u201d said Conte, who is conscious the club\u2019s sole arrival to date this month has not played since suffering a serious hamstring injury last summer. \u201cUp to then I was sure Ross Barkley could play against Norwich. Not to start \u2013 taking a stupid risk is no good \u2013 but, for sure, to play a part of the game. \u201cWe are preparing a friendly game for him during this week and then we will see his physical condition. But I\u2019m very happy for his commitment and physical condition. He could be ready for the next game, or for the one after that.\u201d Chelsea visit Brighton in the league on Saturday, then Arsenal in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday. Merseyside police have confirmed they found no evidence of criminal activity after scrutinising the circumstances of Barkley\u2019s transfer from Everton to Chelsea at the request of the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson. The force\u2019s assistant chief constable, Serena Kennedy, has also written to the Football Association and the Premier League and stated the police would look at the deal again if the governing bodies\u2019 investigations revealed any wrongdoing. Ethan Ampadu will make his third first-team start for Chelsea against Norwich, rather than featuring for the under-18s in their FA Youth Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion. The Wales international will start on one side of David Luiz in a back three. Calum Hudson-Odoi is expected to remain with the juniors, with Michy Batshuayi offered another chance to prove his worth as Chelsea seek to end a run of three successive goalless draws. Eden Hazard is likely to be rested, having been substituted on each of his past four starts. The Belgian had appeared unimpressed at being hauled off before the hour against Leicester on Saturday but Conte, who will be without Gary Cahill and Cesc F\u00e0bregas on Wednesday, cited the need to manage Hazard\u2019s condition after ankle surgery ruled him out of pre-season preparations. \u201cI\u2019m the coach, I decide [who plays],\u201d he said. \u201cMy first task is to do the best for the team and the club, not to make every player happy. Otherwise we\u2019d risk finishing 20th in the table. It\u2019s not important to make players happy. The most important thing is to win. I learned this from the coaches I worked under, from [Marcello] Lippi, [Giovanni] Trapattoni, [Arrigo] Sacchi. \u201cMaybe in the first moment, a player could be angry. But then, after they reflect, they understand you are an honest person and every choice is for the best for the team, and not because one player is more \u2018favoured\u2019 than others.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
