Even so, Middlesbrough\u2019s manager would probably have preferred not to wait until stoppage time to see Dani Ayala\u2019s goal defeat the club which sacked him last November and return the Teesiders to the top of the Championship, three points ahead of Leeds. When Ayala seamlessly controlled a dropping deep free-kick from the substitute Mo Besic before stabbing a shot past Sam Johnstone, Darren Moore looked shell-shocked. Not that a visiting manager mentored by Pulis should have been surprised by Boro\u2019s latest set-piece success. \u201cIt was a bit of a sickener, in that manner, that late in the game,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut myself and Tony are good friends, that won\u2019t change.\u201d Pulis was somewhat happier. \u201cWest Brom have real quality and we\u2019re very, very pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cTheirs is the best squad in this division and anyone who finishes above them will go up automatically but we stopped them and created several chances. Indeed despite the sale of Adama Traor\u00e9, Patrick Bamford and Ben Gibson for a collective \u00a345m this summer, Middlesbrough currently look highly convincing. Switching to a 3-5-2 appears to have helped. This tactical revamp, prompted by Traor\u00e9\u2019s departure for Wolves, makes Pulis\u2019s ensemble appear infinitely better balanced, with Stewart Downing shining once again on the left of the central midfield trio. \u201cIf we can get the wide players we want before the loan window closes we\u2019ll be in good shape,\u201d said Pulis, whose hopes of borrowing Yannick Bolasie from Everton were dashed by Aston Villa this week. \u201cWe go to Leeds next Friday, which is a big test so getting one or two in would be helpful.\u201d West Brom arrived fresh from a 7-1 demolition of QPR. Boro enjoyed the better of the early exchanges and Jonny Howson\u2019s stooping header whizzed fractionally wide after George Friend had unhinged Moore\u2019s backline, but the visitors always retained a certain edge. Aden Flint was deceived by the trajectory of Harvey Barnes\u2019s viciously inswinging, counterattacking cross and could only slice an attempted clearance on to the bar. Perhaps heeding this warning, Boro hassled West Brom ever harder, upping the tempo and refusing their guests time to settle in possession. Tosin Adarabioyo should arguably have conceded a penalty for handling George Friend\u2019s cross and only a brilliant save from Johnstone kept out Downing\u2019s subtly swerving shott. As dusk descended Moore\u2019s body language in the technical area became a little agitated. Pulis\u2019s players were working hard with an impressive cohesion demonstrated by the way they chased down in packs Matt Phillips, Dwight Gayle and any other attacking threats. The only problem for Boro was actually finding a way through West Brom\u2019s own extremely robust back three. Well marshalled by the imposing Egypt defender Ahmed Hegazi, that trio held firm in the face of countless corners and breathed sighs of relief when Martin Braithwaite\u2019s shot arced over the bar. Fears that Boro might end up getting mugged on the break began preying on home fans but when Gayle did show everyone a clean pair of heels the Newcastle loanee striker\u2019s shot was, much to Moore\u2019s chagrin, too high. With Boro newly vulnerable to West Brom\u2019s pace, the power balance shifted, a change emphasised as first Ayala was booked for fouling the accelerating Barnes and then Darren Randolph, hitherto underemployed, smartly repelled Jay Rodriguez\u2019s shot. The time had come for Pulis to bring Besic \u2013 who did arrive from Everton in midweek \u2013 off the bench and the Bosnian duly played a central role in making his manager\u2019s night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
