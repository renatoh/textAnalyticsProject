Which political titan will grasp the sword of Camelot in Arizona's Republican senate primary? And which mere mortal will dare to replace Jim Douglas as governor of Vermont and become master of Montpelier? Yes, if you live in Florida, Arizona, parts of Oklahoma (with a fringe on top), Vermont or even Alaska, tonight is the stuff of high political drama. If you live anywhere else you will probably think: \"Meh\". Unless you are reading this blog, then you are a political junkie and not the sort of person to go \"meh\" to early results from the Oklahoma run-offs. In which case you will already know that the key races are: \u2022 Florida: the excitement is mainly now in the governors race, since Charlie Crist unsportingly ducked out of the Republican primary for the senate seat \u2022 Arizona: it's John McCain versus JD Hayworth! In which McCain will win easily, but we have to maintain the pretense that the Tea Party insane person JD Hayworth is somehow a serious threat \u2022 Vermont: this is mainly list padding \u2022 Oklahoma: God knows. See Vermont. \u2022 Alaska: now this could be mildly interesting but the action will take place well after even political junkies have got bored so we'll probably never know. More about this later Right. Enough of that. Let's have some political crack. 7.43pm ET: \"Primary night could be long for insurgents,\" says Politco, always on the lookout for a silver news-lining to the fact-cloud. What does that mean anyway? That they aren't going to do very well. But then Politico isn't going to run a headline reading: \"Steady as she goes for expected winners\". 8.01pm ET: Some numbers are dribbling out of Florida, one of those strange states with more than one time zone. Which means that although polls closed at 7pm statewide, that was an hour later in the tiny western-most parts of the state. Anyway, they are counting them quite quickly. In the Democratic governor's primary: Alex Sink, the long-anticipated winner, is well ahead of Whatshisname the other guy. In the far more interesting Republican governor's primary, it's neck and neck between wealthy evil mastermind Rick Scott, and Republican party stalwart Bill McCollum. In recent days, McCollum was expected to be running away with this, but Scott's $50m spending may not have all been pissed up a wall. Yet. 8.23pm: Still in Florida, in the US Senate primary - an open seat - there are no surprises in the Republican primary, where Tea Party heartthrob Marco Rubio is running away with it, having had the field largely to himself since Charlie Crist jumped ship to become an independent. But the Democratic senate primary is the one to watch here, and it's a mirror image of the Republican gubernatorial race. This time, wealthy evil mastermind Jeff Greene is ... ah, let's see, losing is the word, to Democratic party stalwart Kendrick Meek. In fact AP has called Florida's Democratic senate primary for Meek. So, great job Jeff Greene, you may as well have just taken $20m and set fire to it for all the good it has done you. The low point of Greene's moronic campaign was when Mike Tyson was forced to speak up to defend Greene. Yes, Mike Tyson - the boxer. When Mike Tyson is a character witness, then you are really in trouble. 8.39pm: There has been talk of political bloggers in the US taking kickbacks in return for support. So, for the record, let me say that this blog is brought to you by Pabst Blue Ribbon and Whole Foods turkey meatloaf. And the letter G. For Guardian. 8.42pm: So with nearly half the precincts counted, super-villan Rick Scott has a fractional lead of a few percentage points over Bill McCollum for the Republican senate nomination. That is potentially bad news for the Republicans since Scott has more baggage than a Louis Vuitton outlet mall. It's not many candidates who can get served a subpoena in the middle of a campaign speech about how clean he was - but that's the sort of guy Rick Scott is. Lucky. 9pm ET: Kidding aside, there's a barn-burner going on right now in Vermont's Democratic governor's primary. There's a near four-way tie with about 20% of the votes counted. One candidate, Deborah Markowitz of Montpelier, has 25.5% of the vote. Then Doug Racine and Peter Shumlin both have 24.6%. Then Matt Dunne has 19%. You could cut the tension with a maple syrup bottle! But all this excitement, I apologise for not including Vermont on the list of must-watch races. We need to know more about Vermont. Any Democrats out there? Hello? They are probably too busy huddled over their radiograms waiting for the latest voting tallies from Hartland. 9.10pm: Someone named Adams is leading in the Florida 24th congressional district primary. It's not me. I'd offer nominal support (get it? nominal?) but he or she is a Republican so, meh. 9.14pm: Want to know more about the nail-biting Vermont Democratic gubernatorial primary? The Burlington Free Press covers it here, under the headline \"Results of Vermont's Governor, US Senate and US House races\". On the website, under \"Related Stories\" is the headline: \"Motorist falls asleep, crashes\". So how are they related, exactly? 9.20pm: Ok, Vermont, make way for breaking news from Florida, where evil genius Dr Rick Scott is sitting in his lair on Death Island, quietly stroking a white cat and enjoying the Republican primary returns that show that soon, the Republican party of Florida will be all his, bwahahahahahaha! This is great news for the Democrats - that is, Democrats in an alternative universe where the Florida party has a stronger candidate than Alex Sink and no spoiler third-party former governor's son. But they don't so Scott will probably win. Just how pro-business is Rick Scott? Put it this way: if he had been governor during the BP Gulf oil spill, Florida would have paid BP compensation for polluting its pristine oil with sand and turtles. 9.30pm: A third of the vote counted in Vermont and the race has been swinging like a Republican senator from Louisiana. Currently, Markowitz and Racine are stuck at 25%, Shumlin has 24% and Dunne has 19%. The reason for this excitement is that a four-way race is very, very rare in politics. In honour of Vermont's primary, I have moved on to Ben &amp; Jerry's Cherry Garcia accompanied by Magic Hat No 9. 10.10pm: Peapod delivery. In the meantime, the top three candidates for the Democratic governor's nomination in Vermont are separated by just 0.5 of a percentage point. What is going on up there? In an attempt to find out, I just googled \"Vermont Democrat blogs\". The top result was this blog. Oh dear. 10.22pm: With 80% of the votes counted, galactic super-villain Rick Scott is still leading foolish earthling Bill McCollum by 46% to 43%. The votes are running out for McCollum to catch up so I'd say this was going to go to Scott, especially as the late-voting Panhandle's conservatives are likely to go for Scott. But who knows? Either way, the Democrats will be excited. Is there a governorship up for grabs? Mmm. Not this year. Although if Democrats can link Scott to shoddy contracting work on the second Death Star, then they have a chance. 10.30pm: Let's interrupt this snarky liveblogging for some serious news: an extraordinarily good speech tonight by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, for an annual Ramadan Iftar held at Gracie Mansion: Here's Bloomberg's speech, and here's a taste: If we say that a mosque or a community centre should not be built near the perimeter of the World Trade Center site, we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom. Followed by: Before closing, let me just add one final thought: Imam Rauf, who is now overseas promoting America and American values, has been put under a media microscope. Each of us may strongly agree or strongly disagree with particular statements that he has made. And that's how it should be - this is New York City. \"And while a few of his statements have received a lot of attention, I would like to read you something that he said that you may not have heard. At an interfaith memorial service for the martyred journalist Daniel Pearl, Imam Rauf said, quote, 'If to be a Jew means to say with all one's heart, mind, and soul: Shma Yisrael, Adonai Elohenu Adonai Ehad; Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One, not only today I am a Jew, I have always been one.' 10.38pm: This is crazy: with 71% of the votes counted, the top three Democratic candidates in the Vermont governor's race are just 0.2% apart. Racine has 25%, Shumlin and Markowitz have 24.8% each. A squeaker. So, let's see what insights the Burlington Free Press had to give: The candidates themselves and political observers agree almost anything can happen as the most extensive and expensive primary race in Vermont history comes to a close. After months of campaigning, no candidate has emerged as the clear favorite. Well they got that right. 10.45pm: Actual news: Rick Scott will be the Republican nominee for the Florida governor election in November. As Larry Sabado notes via Twitter: Rick Scott has apparently defeated not just McCollum but a mighty host of allies: Palin, Gingrich, Jeb Bush, RGA/Barbour ... &amp; list goes on. I guess that means McCollum got endorsements from all those big names, all of whom can expect no favours from a Governor Scott during, say, the 2012 Republican presidential primaries in Florida. 11pm: Polls closing in Arizona. Meanwhile, this just in from Vermont Public Radio: The Democratic race for governor has become a tight three-way contest. With 200 out of 260 precincts reporting, state Sen. Doug Racine, Secretary of State Deb Markowitz and Senate President Peter Shumlin each has roughly 25% of the vote. They're separated by just 278 votes out a total of nearly 52,000 votes counted so far. Former state Sen. Matt Dunne trails with 20% of the vote. And Sen. Susan Bartlett is well back with 5%. Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie is the only Republican in the governor's race. He'll face whomever wins the Democratic nomination. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why Politico is so awesome: who else has a county-level voting results map of the Vermont governor's race? It's here. 11.18pm: Well that didn't take long: 18 minutes after polls closed and CNN has called the Arizona Republican senate primary for John McCain. Thanks for coming JD Hayworth, you may return to obscurity now. McCain will coast it in November, this was the big one for him, and to win so easily, well ... makes you wonder why he needed to spend all of that $20m on beating up Hayworth. And now AP has called it for McCain as well. 11.30pm: So much for John McCain. Back to the real action: Vermont, where the top three candidates Doug Racine, Peter Shumlin and Deb Markowitz are separated by just a few hundreds votes, or about one percentage point. What does this all mean? Here's reader Kevin Sheilds via email explaining the politics of Vermont: As I'm sure you know [don't be so sure. R], Democratic primary races in Vermont almost always decide the winner, unless you're Bernie Sanders and have the balls to run as a socialist. Doug Racine represents a sort of centre-left, Howard Dean establishment vote that Vermont as a whole seems to at least be okay with, but Democrats are largely dissatisfied with for being too right-wing on issues like gun-control. He's likely to win. Deb Markowitz is the secretary of state, and represents a Clinton-esque brand, in that she claims to both know how to play the game and wants to change it at the same time. We'll have to see whether or not anyone buys that. Peter Shumlin fancies himself a populist. He claims to be a \"fiscal conservative, social liberal who believes in common sense\" which means he's anti-taxes but doesn't hate gays. Matt Dunne is not going to win. He's nice, but just too boring to take seriously. There you go. Everything worth knowing about Vermont, and then some. Thank you Kevin, that was perfect. I particularly liked \"anti-taxes but doesn't hate gays,\" which I may steal for my campaign plank if I ever run for office. 11.50pm: Oh yeah, and Jan Brewer romped home in the Republican primary for Arizona governor. So all that race-baitin' weren't for nothing. She'll be running against a Democrat named... let's see... oh yes, probably Rodney Glassman. Chin up. Voting in Arizona shows McCain administering a kicking to Hayworth at the polls, winning by two-to-one. There's life in the old dog yet, etc. JD, back to your not very good brand of talk radio. 11.57pm: Speaking of Arizona: Dan Quayle's son, Ben, is leading a close four-way race in the state's third congressional district Republican primary. He sounds as academically challenged as his father, the former vice president who is of course better known as winner of the Nobel prize for physics. 12.07am: The Associated Press struggles to find a grand unifying theme: But the early results indicated that if there was a single pattern to the night, it was the lack of one. So tonight's theme is: there is no theme. 12.20am: According to the AP vote tallies in Vermont, Doug Racine trails Peter Shumlin by just 75 votes. Now, Vermont isn't a very big state (population 621,000) but still, that's tight. 12.30am: This is a good moment to wrap it up: \u2022 The big result of the night was Rick Scott winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Florida, an upset of sorts against an establishment candidate endorsed by arty leaders, including Jeb Bush. The very wealthy Scott spent something like $50m in the primary and can easily do so again in the general election. Alex Sink is the Democratic nominee and she will need hefty outside support to have a chance. Scott's troubled career as head of a rapacious health insurance company may not endear him to Florida voters, and Republicans may not rally around him, as they have the tougher senate race involving Marco Rubio versus Charlie Crist to concentrate energy on. So is this another instance of Republicans passing up an easy win thanks to a weak candidate? Maybe. But unlike some other candidates, at least Scott can pay his own way. \u2022 The reverse was the case in the Democratic senate primary in Florida: there the baggage-laden moneybags got nothing back for his $20m, with Kendrick Meek beating Jeff Greene pretty easily. \u2022 John McCain cruised to victory over Tea Party and anti-immigration nasty JD Hayworth to defend his Arizona senate seat, in light turnout. Hayworth was a flawed candidate but nonetheless McCain crushed him in the Republican primary. \u2022 Another poor night for the Tea Party, not that it matters. But it looks like gaining one upset, in Arizona's 8th district where Jesse Kelly is trouncing a hotly-tipped Republican. \u2022 And Vermont's Democratic governor race turned ut to be the event of the night \u2013 it's still going now, with less than 50 votes between the top two. And there was me saying this was just filler. \u2022 Alaska can wait. Goodnight and thanks for reading. Only 69 days until the 2010 midterms on 2 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
