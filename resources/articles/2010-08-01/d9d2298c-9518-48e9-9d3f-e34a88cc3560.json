However, the road ferry which operated across the narrows of Loch Carron from Strome Ferry to North Strome continued until 1961. The decline of Strome Ferry has continued \u2013 not only has it the \"no ferry\" of the road sign, it also has no station building, no general store and post office, no hotel, no church and no chapel. Sic transit gloria mundi. Patrick Ireland Stroud, Gloucestershire \u2022\u2008When I was at primary school in north London, our games teacher, Ernest Turkington, in his best Belfast accent, told us to bring a \"pair of Spurs socks\" the following week. In his next lesson the whole class was wearing socks from the Tottenham Hotspur replica kit (even the Arsenal boys). He was apoplectic \u2013 he'd meant \"spare\" socks (Letters, 5 August). Andrew Varley Millhouse Green, South Yorkshire \u2022\u2008So Ofcom has criticised Press TV for a programme on the Israeli assault on the Freedom flotilla because of a complaint \"that the show failed to air alternative views\" (Ofcom rules TV show on Gaza flotilla was biased, 2 August). One hopes the regulator is taking similar action against British broadcasters which, for days after the attack, failed to include \"alternative views\" to the Israeli propaganda. Ibrahim Hewitt Senior editor, Middle East Monitor \u2022\u2008Seemingly, Drax sees burning biomass such as woodchips \"as carbon neutral'' (Drax seeks subsidy for move to biomass, 4 August). Such neutrality can only be achieved by very imaginative accounting and blatant disregard of most of the energy expended in growing trees, converting them to woodchips, and transporting them to the power station. David Walker Morpeth, Northumberland \u2022\u2008Surely the City of London needs a pub called The Laughing Banker (Editorial, 5 August). James Willis Alton, Hampshire \u2022\u2008Is this the first time binder twine's been used as a thread (Letters, 4 August)?
