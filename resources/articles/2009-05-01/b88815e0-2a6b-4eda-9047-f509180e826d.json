Stephen Gell St Albans The writer, Tim Anderson, replies: \"In Windows 7, icons on the taskbar itself are used both for showing running applications and, if pinned, for launching applications; this is new. The Quick Launch toolbar in Vista is a separate, optional section that is solely for launching selected applications.\" \u2022 A lot of people (like me) will initially fall for the hype surrounding PC-Within-a-PC or Multiple- Windows- environments on- a- single- PC or built-in support for virtualization. It was very important for MS to provide an \"XP-Mode\" given that close to 70% of windows users are on XP today. So this virtualization feature is also aimed at luring the If-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it XP users to upgrade but still be able to cling to their favorite OS. http://manjubhat.wordpress.com \u2022 There is nothing in this article that makes me think upgrading from XP to Windows 7 would be a good idea. twitter.com/aarons Twitter ye not Thanks to Seth Finkelstein (Read Me First, 7 May) for stripping bare the reality of Twitter. The only thing I would argue with is that a better response to the question \"What are you doing?\" may be \"None of your damn business\". Alan Gent Cheadle \u2022 I have just listened to the podcast on the brain and social networking (Tech Weekly: Facebook's effects on your brain, 28 April). I, for one, am not convinced that things such as Twitter are anything but a bit of fun that have become overused by celebrities, institutions and businesses desperate for followers. For example, my college learning centre (library to you and I) now uses Twitter, but I'm not quite sure what for! David Fletcher Sunbury-on-Thames \u2022 Blogs and online magazines such as the Huffington Post and Slate are well regarded and have played no small part in advancing, if not the death, then certainly the immediate crisis in print media. And it's fair to say that the Guardian has perhaps embraced this new technology and mindset better than most (even if it means they have to publish at least one \"I hate Twitter!\" article per month, just to maintain journalistic balance). http://twittercism.com \u2022 Of course, the sanctity of publication is an attribute that derives from the scarcity of publication, which has been the dominant characteristic of the Gutenberg world (the world of mass media). Within this world the simple act of publication attached status, because it was expensive or risky to publish anything. There were two principal hurdles that a piece of information needed to get over to make it to publication. First, it had to appeal to a mass audience and secondly it had to adhere to a set of protocols (sometimes called standards of journalism), most of which were devised to protect its publisher from any legal redress that inaccuracy might incur. Social media, of course, doesn't have to conform to these strictures because it is defined by the fact that the means of publication are free and readily available to anyone. And this leaves many in the traditional media or published elite either totally confused or just plain hopping mad. Hence the cries of indignation. http://richardstacy.com \u2022 Sure there are lots of other devices you can use to stay in touch \u2013 but I simply don't. I use Twitter because it's fast, simple and straightforward. I don't need useless games included in Facebook or hours of chatting on Skype. Twitter works for me and helps me to stay in touch more often, regardless of what some \"stars\" post who have thousands of followers. \"Serious\" discussion about education or eLearning is possible; there are such groups. ButIn my understanding Twitter is a purely private thing which has nothing to do with being (or not being) elite at all. lernado.com \u2022 So, remember all 1.2 zillion of you bloggers, tweeters, facebookers and other corporate tools \u2013 there's someone who's on to your game, and he won't get fooled again! http://www.themashnote.com \u2022 Seth Finkelstein in today's Guardian articulates much more lucidly than I ever could exactly why I hate Twitter. shinyshinyshiny.blogspot.com \u2022 Well, gee, here's an idea \u2013 if you don't want to engage people, you don't want to reveal anything real about yourself, and you hate everyone else for climbing the social ladder to their own benefit \u2013 be anti-social on your own time. rizzn.com/socnets \u2022 I have tried Twitter. I didn't quite enjoy it, so I don't foresee becoming a regular user there. It's not clear to me what it was about Twitter that bummed me out; but it's certainly not the sociological issues highlighted by Finkelstein \u2013 I really haven't thought much about them until I read his piece. It's quite possible that I don't enjoy Twitter because I don't \"get\" it. That's okay; the Web does offer many ways of dealing with the online world, and we get to pick the pathologies we are comfortable with. nanopolitan.blogspot.com \u2022 I haven't made my mind up yet. twitter.com/stuharrod \u2022 Guess you can't please em all! twitter.com/allenweiss \u2022 Don't bash the tool when you make it \"what it is\". witter.com/michellek107 \u2022 This Coming from the guy who follows no one. At least he gets 'linkbait'. Sucker. twitter.com/chrispian \u2022 Nothing better than critical theory to shake up a consumer's spirit. twitter.com/holychic \u2022 This article, which I read in a real-life newspaper, raises some interesting points about this here Twitter lark. twitter.com/roystoncartoons \u2022 @SethFinkelstein, god bless him, is stealing my ideas. He needs a haircut, a shave and, I suspect, a bath. twitter.com/ajkeen \u2022 He doesn't realise that society is shifting from the neolithic farmers' principle of reciprocity to one of attention. twitter.com/johnkeithhart \u2022 After Seth Finklestein's debunking of twitter, am wondering whether to continue attempting to come to grips with it all. twitter.com/katepullinger \u2022 Yes but, no but: Seth, you've missed many points... twitter.com/mikejwalsh \u2022 I like Seth Finkelstein's analysis of Twitter: \"mutual pontification among a tiny elite\". What, us? Never! twitter.com/AdrianCorbett \u2022 I love when people say that twitter sucks when it's obvious they're just pissed that they don't have any followers. twitter.com/bellabailey \u2022 Couldn't Seth Finkelstein at least admit that Twitter makes it much easier to rent-a-quote for puff-piece journalism? twitter.com/fraserspeirs \u2022 Another awful article complaining that Twitter is not what he wants, and thinking it is only one thing. twitter.com/iwrotethis \u2022 What a load of bollocks ! I don't feel part of an \"elite\" and I'm not a \"high-attention individual\". Cheeky sod. twitter.com/jjjen \u2022 Irony overload: Finkelstein on Twitter. Darn that 'one to many broadcast medium controlled by the elite', unlike newspapers. twitter.com/Reynolds \u2022 As Mr Marx put it: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. twitter.com/alaninantwerp \u2022 I give this guy one year before he's hooked and writing a formal retraction and apology. twitter.com/aschernathan \u2022 A LOT of very good points made here... enough to make me consider scrapping Twitter and go back to Facebook. twitter.com/happinessstabs Apple embargo Thanks to #BabyShaker, @TrentReznor can't even get an app in the iTunes Store! (Newly asked questions, 7 May). twitter.com/MindOfWard Image isn't everything The article (The naked truth: sex doesn't sell games, 7 May) assumes Lara Croft's original success was purely based on the way she looked. Tomb Raider was one of the earliest pioneering 3D platformers. I'm not saying Croft's media image wasn't a big influence on sales, but the fact that the game was good is surely of some importance. Similarly, as the article tries to prove its point that things have moved on, it cites commercial failures to support its wafer-thin premise. Of course Hellgate: London and Tabula Rasa were failures, they were critically panned. Kane &amp; Lynch is infamously poor. These are games that may have featured pretty women in various states of undress, but they were also shite. It proves nothing. The tit-heavy Age of Conan may have eventually conked out last year, but it had a million sales on or near launch \u2013 if that's a failure, then the Guardian's sales figures must be an unmitigated disaster. dontshootfood.com \u2022 Hmm. If/when I get a PS3, I may end up actually buying a Tomb Raider game if Lara isn't going to look like poseur porn any more. simargl-wings.livejournal.com \u2022 I think the key question is not whether or not a game is sexy, but whether or not a game is fun. If the game is not fun, well, all the breasts in the world won't make it fun. politicalcomment.blogspot.com Emotional response OMG!!! U haf 2 rite lik dis 2 use MySpace!!?!?
