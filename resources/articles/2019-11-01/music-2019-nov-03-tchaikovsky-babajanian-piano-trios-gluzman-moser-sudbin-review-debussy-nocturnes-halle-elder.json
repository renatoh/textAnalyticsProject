Yet a year later he chose the form as the best way to pay tribute to his mentor, the pianist and conductor Nikolai Rubinstein. Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Trio in A minor \u201cin memory of a great artist\u201d is the centrepiece of a new recording of Tchaikovsky &amp; Babajanian Piano Trios (BIS) from the starry lineup of violinist Vadim Gluzman, cellist Johannes Moser and pianist Yevgeny Sudbin. The playing is superb, Gluzman and Moser intoning the impassioned opening elegy with grave authority before Sudbin takes over with all his mercurial brilliance and the music takes flight. The ensuing 11 variations that make up the rest of the lengthy piece and its closing allegro are each imbued with their own distinct colour and character in a profound performance. That same ferocious intelligence is brought to Arno Babajanian\u2019s piano trio from 1952, a piece rooted in folk song from his native Armenia, and therefore acceptable to Stalin\u2019s cultural policies (which Babajanian quickly threw over when the old monster died a year later). Gluzman\u2019s playing of the aching aria for violin that opens the second movement is just one moment to treasure in this outstanding recording. \u2022 The year Tchaikovsky wrote his trio, his patron Nadezhda von Meck employed a young French pianist to teach her children in Moscow. That was Claude Debussy, whose music Mark Elder and the Hall\u00e9 orchestra have made something of a speciality in a series of top recordings. Their latest, Nocturnes (Hall\u00e9), explores works from across the composer\u2019s career, including his cantata La Damoiselle \u00e9lue \u2013 a reprise of an acclaimed performance given at the Proms last year with soloists Anna St\u00e9phany and Sophie Bevan \u2013 and a world premiere recording of the charming Les soirs illumin\u00e9s par l\u2019ardeur du charbon, not discovered until 2001 and orchestrated by Colin Matthews. \u2022 There\u2019s still time to catch composer Steve Reich talk about Equal, a monumental sculpture by Richard Serra, in The Way I See It (BBC Sounds).
