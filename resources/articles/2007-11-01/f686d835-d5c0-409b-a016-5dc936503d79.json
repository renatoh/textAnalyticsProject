They showed the number of family doctors earning over \u00a3250,000 nearly doubled to 307 in 2005-06. The number earning over \u00a3200,000 went up from 629 to 1,122. Opposition politicians were careful not to antagonise the medical profession by suggesting doctors are earning too much. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats called on GPs to do more to earn their salaries by improving the quality of service to patients. Ben Bradshaw, the health minister, insisted that GPs should be well rewarded but said ministers wanted them to work more flexibly. \"The current contract has helped boost GP numbers and improve care for patients. But we do want to see GPs offering more convenient and flexible opening hours for patients. \"We will be working with GPs to ensure that at least 50% of practices extend their opening hours and we are taking action to tie GP income more closely to patient experiences.\" Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said: \"GPs should take increasing responsibility for the commissioning of services for their patients. Instead they are being treated by this government like well-paid production line employees.\" GPs' earnings began climbing sharply in 2004-05 with the first effects of a contract offered by the government to reward practices that improved the quality of services for patients. Most GPs scored higher marks than the government expected, adding an unbudgeted \u00a3250m to wage bills. The contract also allowed GPs to opt out of caring for patients outside normal surgery hours in return for losing \u00a36,000 of basic salary. For the past three years the out-of-hours service has been organised by primary care trusts, which recruited doctors on a freelance basis. GPs willing to provide cover after midnight and at weekends had the opportunity to substantially increase their earnings. Family doctors could also boost their income by treating patients privately and conducting medical examinations for insurance companies. The figures from the government's Information Centre for Health and Social Care were compiled from tax returns showing GPs' pre-tax profits after deducting practice expenses and substantial pension contributions. Pre-tax earnings of the average partner in a GP practice increased by 9.7% to \u00a3113,600 in England, \u00a3102,200 in Wales, \u00a398,700 in Northern Ireland and \u00a390,600 in Scotland. The sums were more than double income received by GPs in 1998-89. The average GP partner also put away \u00a311,764 in pension contributions, excluded from declared income. The Association of Independent Specialist Medical Accountants declined to comment yesterday on the characteristics of doctors who were netting the largest incomes. The official data suggested it may have been partners in big practices with tens of thousands of patients, who employed salaried doctors and nurses to do most of the work. GPs dispensing drugs in a pharmacy attached to the practice also had higher earnings. The British Medical Association said GPs have not had a pay rise for two years, but costs continued rising. Laurence Buckman, chairman of the GPs committee, said the zero pay awards were equivalent to a 6% real terms cut in salaries since 2005-06. \"Family doctors are now being penalised for rising to the challenge of performance-related-pay for delivering the quality care the government asked for.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
