I have a vivid memory of my first trip abroad with school, to France. I was walking on the grass in the park and within 10 seconds I was being shouted at by someone telling me to get off. I remember thinking: \"God, what a weird country! It looks just the same as home, but you can't walk on the grass in a park.\" It was a very early indicator of how strange other places can be. In one geography lesson we were told to write an essay on dams. I chose the Cahora Bassa dam in Mozambique, though I couldn't find much information. Years later, I was in Mozambique and I wanted to go and have a look at the dam. The guard wouldn't let me near it. I tried telling him I was writing a book, that I was an academic, but nothing worked. Finally, I told him I'd written an essay on it at school but couldn't find out much about it. He said: \"Why didn't you say so before?\" and stamped all my documents to let me through. For the book, I went to live in four types of physical environment where I - and most people - would find it hard to survive. I had ups and downs and had to eat some disgusting things and wasn't very good at catching crocodiles. Even though the environments were difficult, no one said to me: \"This is an awful place to live.\" It's always a case of \"east, west, home's best\". One time, in Ethiopia, I met some cattleherders. There are certain questions you ask to be polite - \"How are your cows? Are they fat?\" - which I asked. But when they asked me in return, I had to say I didn't have any cows. It all got a bit nervy. They had Kalashnikovs and started fingering them suspiciously because they just didn't understand how I couldn't have any cows. I have been to more than 70 countries. I don't know what gives people the travel bug. I don't think I'll ever stop. I'm never going to run out of places to go to, and even if I did I could start again and they wouldn't be the same. \u00b7Nick Middleton's latest book, Surviving Extremes, is out now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
