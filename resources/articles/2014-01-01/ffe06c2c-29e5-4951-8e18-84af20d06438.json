Imagine there are no haters", "bodyText": "\u2022 As the BBC director general Tony Hall and publicity hungry/prudent MPs bear down on executive pay, the one remuneration issue that just won't go away at the corporation is the rather peculiar arrangement enjoyed by Alan Yentob. What exactly does he do, critics ask? A little bit of this, a little bit of that, comes the answer. How much is he paid? Ah, now you're asking. Sharp intake of breath. The tabloids periodically try to peel this particular onion, and of late, one nosy sort has been digging away using freedom of information legislation. To no great effect, it must be said. No information has to be disclosed, says the corporation, if it is held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature. This covers much of what he does. \"I can confirm that there is no job description for Mr Yentob's role, due to the fact that this is highly specialised and bespoke role that is unique to Mr Yentob. The post of creative director is not a contracted full-time role,\" says a voice from the Beeb. There is stuff on websites, including a reference to the \"total executive remuneration of \u00a3183,300\", with a presenter's fee on top for his arts series Imagine. But terms of employment \"are considered to be personal information\", thus not liable to disclosure. The chase will go on, but the quarry is elusive. Always one step ahead. \u2022 A tough job maintaining that position, mind you. The quest for info on Yentob's activities and remuneration was not only complicated by application of rules and exemptions. The Beeb also missed the applicable deadlines and failed to keep the petitioner in the loop, thereby breaching the Freedom of Information Act. Such slovenliness won't do in 2014. \u2022 Meanwhile, with much to look forward to this year, pop chanteuse Lily Allen tells Q magazine about her forthcoming (as yet untitled) album, due in May. One song that's guaranteed to ruffle feathers is called Chipping Norton. It concerns PR guru Matthew Freud's 2011 party in the Oxfordshire town, near to where David Cameron and former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks live, the centre of the so-called Chipping Norton set. Former BBC director general Mark Thompson was there, along with Michael Gove, David Miliband, Jeremy Clarkson, James Murdoch and Brooks herself. \"It's a song about that party and our relationship with the people that print newspapers,\" says Allen, who was also among the feted that day and whose life has spawned many column inches. Say more, prompts Q. \"We shouldn't talk about that until that court case is over,\" she says. Or the album is out. Whichever happens first. \u2022 A disastrous year's end for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, whose televised spring promise to \"reverse the jobless rise\" by 31 December exploded with the Boxing Day figures. Zut alors \u2013 there was another rise. The beleaguered French prez fled the universal catcalls to Saudi Arbia, where he was presented with a ceremonial sword by King Abdullah on Sunday. \"I'm going to be needing this,\" he quipped. \u2022 Finally, onward, onward, but it would be a mistake to forget what we have seen, and in that spirit, GQ magazine considers who are the worst-dressed notables. The field is varied; judgments damning. There's the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage (\"He doesn't look too bad in a suit \u2013 but when he goes casual, it always begs the question: 'Why would someone who is still under 50 dress like that?'\"); TV egghead Brian Cox (\"We love everything about TV's favourite scientist \u2013 apart from the fact that he still insists on looking like one of the Monkees.\"); politico George Galloway (\"When you look at the leftwing firebrand, you just have to pray that the revolution won't be televised.\") And then there is the Rev Paul Flowers, the former boss of the Co-operative Bank now facing investigation following allegations about drug use and his sex life. None can yet pronounce on all that, with legal wheels in motion, \"but still the Co-op Bank's former chairman's dress sense should be an offence,\" says GQ. So many have questions to answer in this regard, not least men of a certain maturity. Let us sin no more.
