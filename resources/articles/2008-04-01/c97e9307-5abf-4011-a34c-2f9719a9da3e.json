The MPC gets a nudge from the Mirror: \"If it inexplicably fails to rise to the challenge, then bank governor Mervyn King will have some uncomfortable questions to answer.\" And another nudge from Anatole Kaletsky in the Times. He thinks the predictions of economists over the last few days haven't been gloomy enough. \"Any simple comparison with the recent US experience suggests that house prices here should probably fall by a further 30% in the next two years, even assuming that personal incomes per head continue to grow by about 5% annually.\" He offers potential mitigating factors in the UK, but ends up concluding that the test for British institutions - like the Bank of England's MPC - has only just begun. The Telegraph counsels Alistair Darling to heed the advice of George Osborne and Vince Cable. This would be to force the Bank to frame not just inflation rates but also credit conditions - allowing it the power to limit how much banks lend each other during economic upturns while allowing them a longer leash during downturns. It says there are signs these ideas are being listened to at the Treasury and it urges Darling to get on and raise it at the IMF meeting this weekend. Ruth Lea, writing in the Guardian, says: \"Take a deep breath: the system is not collapsing.\" What she's worried about is the government responding by imposing more regulation. \"Inevitably the bank bail-outs and chief executives walking away with generous pay-offs lead to calls for more regulations.\" No, she says. Instead, Gordon Brown's introduction of a tripartite monitoring system should be scrapped and banking regulation given back to the Bank of England. * Guardian: Spare us the meddlers * Mirror: Cut rates to ease pain * Times: Disaster ahead * Telegraph: Alistair Darling clutches at straws HALF OF PUBLIC BACKS HYBRID EMBRYOS A poll by the Times shows fairly strong public support for scientists creating human-animal embryos with a view to tackling Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This is the first poll on the popularity of the research since the concerted attack by Catholic leaders over Easter weekend. Half of respondents backed the new laws contained in the government's human fertilisation and embryology bill, which will begin its passage through the House of Commons next month. Thirty percent opposed it. The poll suggests the creation of hybrid cells has been overtaken in the unpopularity stakes by another section of the bill that removes the legal requirement for infertility clinics to consider a child's need for a father before accepting patients for treatment. This, the paper says, will now become the government's biggest problem. Further back, the paper runs the first interview with Lisa Jardine, the professor of renaissance studies who became head of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority this month. It will fall to her to implement the legislation once it's through, and she discusses her other role overseeing infertility treatment in the UK. At the Guardian, a report suggests one more type of infertility treatment is about to become available: a \"milder\" form regarded as safer and more effective. * Guardian: Milder IVF more likely to work * Times: Scientists win public support on embryo research 'BIN LADEN'S MAN' STAYS IN BRITAIN The rightwing papers are livid that Abu Qatada and 12 Libyan terror suspects have been allowed to stay in the UK. The Daily Mail, with a picture of him on the front page, declares \"This is Bin Laden's man in Britain. Yesterday a court ruled he can't be deported. No prizes for guessing why.\" Human rights law is the answer and in the Mail's eyes that is a \"farce\". In the eyes of Camilla Cavendish, too. In the Times, she advises the government has two options. Since the men are now staying in the country, charges should be brought against them. But she says the government has rejected this idea (and she worries it has done so because of a lack of evidence... why might that be?). The other would be for Britain to derogate in principle from the European convention on human rights as the French and Spanish have done in practice. She doesn't say how. * Mail: Bin Laden's 'right-hand man' * Times: Can we let terrorists go free? BROWN'S FROWN George Pascoe Watson in the Sun writes that people inside the Labour party are now so fed up with Brown they are looking round for someone to replace him. He calls it \"prime minister's tension\" - or at least he does in the paper edition. Online it has been turned into \"New Labour in PM Brown frown\". His theory is: \"Some contenders are beginning to organise themselves knowing they may have less than two years to get a campaign together.\" He goes on to list the contenders. Julian Glover in the Guardian says the PM should learn from Kevin Rudd, Australia's Labour PM, who has just visited Britain. Rudd is a policy wonk by inclination just like Brown, yet somehow, Glover says, Rudd carries it off with much more success. \"The lesson from Rudd is that winners can be odd, that an obsessive interest in quota reform is not a bar to office and that Australia was prepared to elect a bookish leader who does not even like cricket. \"If Brown is to shake off the assumption that he isn't any good at being prime minister, he shouldn't try to smile more or do chat. He should shut up, decide what he wants to do and set about it.\" John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, should cheer Brown up. Curtice does not think the pounding that many predict the Labour party will receive in this year's local elections will come to pass. The last time the councils being contested this May were contested was 2004. This was another very bad year for Labour - the worst local election performance since the 1960s - and its losses were huge. \"True, it would take little more than a small swing for the party to lose Reading, only one of three councils in the south of England outside London that the party still controls.\" But the party could actually make some gains, Curtice says. \"The arithmetic of the elections outside London could be Gordon Brown's salvation.\" * Guardian: Watch and learn Mr Brown * Sun: New Labour in PM Brown Frown * Independent: Labour has little to lose in this poll FIRST LADY OF FOOTBALL Karren Brady has been arrested and her picture appears in almost all papers. Brady, the managing director of Birmingham City football club, and David Sullivan, a co-owner, were taken in yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting, three weeks after police raided their club's grounds. The Times calls the pair \"two of the most colourful characters in English football\". The Sun, where she has written columns, doesn't run the story at all. * Guardian: Birmingham City bosses arrested in fraud inquiry * Times: David Sullivan and Karren Brady arrested in corruption inquiry NEVER MIND THE POST OFFICE What about the village pub? The Telegraph reports that the other hub of community life seems to be in severe danger. They are closing at a rate of four a day. Last year 1,409 closed, almost seven times more than in 2006. It seems it's because we are drinking less beer inside pubs - in 2006, sales dipped below 30m pints a day, down 49% on the peak of 1979 and the lowest since the 1930s. Instead, people are buying cheaper beer from supermarkets. The smoking ban has also kept people away from pubs. * Telegraph: Low sales force four village pubs to close a day TODAY ON GUARDIAN.CO.UK &gt;&gt; Pound hits new record low against euro &gt;&gt; 50 Burmese migrant workers found dead in back of lorry &gt;&gt; Roger Alton confirmed as new editor of Independent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
