They would be modelled on American 'charter schools', which offer free education - often to black children who have failed to thrive in mainstream schools - typically based on strict discipline and traditional teaching popular with parents. Conservatives must 'give unhappy parents the sort of choice which at present is obtainable only to those who can pay for it', shadow education spokesman Damian Green will argue in the first major plank of schools policy since the election. But he will quietly shelve plans floated by Iain Duncan Smith last year to introduce vouchers for parents, to be used towards the cost of private schooling. Green will argue it would be 'premature' to decide on vouchers until parents have been given a wider choice of state-funded schools through a charter-style system - which would allow groups of parents, teachers or private management firms to start schools. 'There is a patronising assumption that poorer parents won't know what to do if they don't like their kids' schools. Actually they know perfectly well what to do, they care as much about their kids' education as middle-class parents, but at the moment they have no power,' said Green. Critics fear however that charter schools appeal most strongly to groups with an agenda - from fundamentalist Christian parents to private firms pushing commercial interests on children. The idea follows passionate debate over whether British schools have failed ethnic minority children in particular. Tories hope the idea will prove they are still wooing what Duncan Smith calls 'vulnerable' voters such as inner-city families, despite anger on the party's right wing, which believes he has strayed too far on to centre ground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
