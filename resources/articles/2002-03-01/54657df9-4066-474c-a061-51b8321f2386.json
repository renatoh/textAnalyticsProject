Accepting medical opinion that neither Robinson nor Vickery, suffering respectively from abdominal and ankle problems, was likely to recover before the weekend, the England manager has instead switched Leicester's Austin Healey from wing to full-back, recalled Dan Luger and drafted Bristol's Julian White into the front row of a pack that contains only one form-related change in the wake of the 20-15 defeat in France earlier this month. Wasps' Joe Worsley is the unlucky man, losing out to his good friend Lewis Moody whose recent form for Leicester has persuaded Woodward to rejig his back row. The 23-year-old Moody, who has not previously started a Six Nations game, will be on the blindside flank with Richard Hill switching to No8 where he enjoyed an excellent game for Saracens at the weekend. With Danny Grewcock replacing Johnson and Matt Dawson regaining his place on the bench ahead of Nick Duncombe, it is still a team to make Wales, without a Twickenham win since 1988, fearful of what might occur if everything clicks; and Woodward stressed that his squad are extremely keen to wash away the pain of Paris. \"It's been a long three weeks and Saturday can't come quick enough for me,\" he said. \"The French game annoyed me more than any other game in the last four years. By our standards we were nowhere near what we know we can do. Some of our key players under the intense pressure of that French start didn't think correctly but we don't suddenly become a poor team based on one poor performance.\" Worsley, according to Woodward, has not so much paid the price for one bad game as failing to reproduce the exceptional heights he reached in the autumn Tests. In Moody, though, he has a replacement who will give Wales a run for their much debated bonus money. \"It adds a lot of pace to our team with him in it,\" agreed Woodward. As for Healey, his selection at full-back makes perfect sense in the circumstances, with Woodward unwilling to pitch Tim Stimpson straight back into the starting line-up and the continuing travails of Iain Balshaw forcing the management to send him quietly back to the A team. \"If you can play on the wing for England you can certainly play at full-back. It'll be interesting to see what Wales make of it,\" said Woodward, undeterred that Healey has played only one recent club game in the position and no more than 10 in his life. England: Healey (Leicester); Cohen (Northampton), Tindall (Bath), Greenwood (Harlequins), Luger (Harlequins); Wilkinson (Newcastle), Bracken (Saracens); Rowntree (Leicester), Thompson (Northampton), White (Bristol), Grewcock (Bath), Kay (Leicester), Moody (Leicester), Back (Leicester, capt), Hill (Saracens). Replacements: West (Leicester), Leonard (Harlequins), Corry (Leicester), Worsley (Wasps), Dawson (Northampton), Hodgson (Sale), Stimpson (Leicester). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
