In the company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2015 results, it outdid Wall Street expectations by a full five cents per share and added 5.59 million viewers, boosting worldwide subscriptions to nearly 75m. The popular streaming video service used its better-than-expected earnings report to fire back at NBCUniversal, which published its own estimates of the ratings-shy video provider\u2019s shows earlier this month. Reed Hastings, CEO, took the opportunity to have a few words with his detractors, singling out a news article as a call \u201cto be fearful\u201d. \u201cOr, at the other extreme, an NBC executive recently said internet TV is overblown and that linear TV is \u2018TV like God intended\u2019. Our investors are not as sure of God\u2019s intentions for TV,\u201d Hastings wrote in a letter to shareholders. The company\u2019s profits declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter; Netflix also said it anticipates higher turnover among existing subscribers in the coming two quarters as it begins \u201creleasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering,\u201d or, in layman\u2019s terms, raising prices by $2 for people who were on the $7.99 plan to $9.99 if they want to keep HD. David Wells, Netflix\u2019s CFO, said the company would likely look to raise more debt later in 2016, possibly in 2017. \u201cYou should assume the debt instruments are similar to the ones we\u2019ve used in the past,\u201d said Wells, a reference to Netflix\u2019s bonds. \u201cWe think we\u2019ll become a better credit risk in \u201817-\u201818. To date our bonds have traded pretty well.\u201d Netflix still relies heavily on the catalogs of traditional TV networks for its business model to function; Hastings said the relationship was symbiotic, not parasitic. In what may be a first for a corporate earnings report, the executive also singled out competitors for praise, including Hulu, HBO Now and CBS All Access, calling them \u201cthe beginnings\u201d of plans \u201cto use the revenue from Netflix and other SVOD [streaming video on demand] services to fund both great content and their own evolution\u201d. Rich Greenfield, analyst with BTIG, wrote a series of open questions for Hastings, among them whether its pricing structure overseas should be reworked (in India in particular, the 500-rupee price point may have been too high), and how payments will work during the much-publicized rollout of \u201cNetflix everywhere\u201d, the company\u2019s international expansion. Netflix\u2019s legacy original business model, DVDs by mail, is falling off, but Hastings said it was \u201cmanaging the decline well\u201d; customers who like the physical discs better than (or in addition to) the over-the-web service contributed some $80m to the bottom line. \u201cWe don\u2019t release title\u2010level ratings as our business model is not dependent on advertising or affiliate fees,\u201d Hastings wrote. \u201cIt is member viewing and satisfaction that propels our growth.\u201d Charlie Biello, director of research at Pension Partners, tweeted a comparison of revenue growth among major media companies; Netflix was not merely at the head of the pack but the inverse of Fox, which shrank 23% while Netflix grew by the same amount. The company will up its internally produced video from 450 hours to 600 hours in 2016 \u2013 more than enough to fill a network primetime schedule for an entire season. While Hastings remained cagey about actual viewership figures, he did reiterate that Adam Sandler\u2019s critically reviled movie The Ridiculous Six had been the most popular film in the history the service for its first 30 days of availability. The company will also make efforts to improve its mobile app by trying to make its use of cellular data more efficient."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
