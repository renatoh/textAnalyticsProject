Model commission she is not: camping out in her publisher's offices to finish the final draft, passing out in the boardroom just as the suits turn up for a meeting, sleepwalking through press interviews and hitting on a source of powerful heroin a few hours after arriving to wow Amsterdam. She even turned her columns for the Guardian in late. This is a woman with \"liability\" written all over her. Which is also, of course, what makes her so marketable and, to broaden the argument, puts her adopted genre - the warts-and-all, lay-it-bare confession - in such an enviable critical position. If your subject's modus operandi is dry-eyed self-deconstruction, what else can you say? You don't like Elizabeth Wurtzel? Neither does she. Her endless litany of self-abuse, the cycle of promises broken, the friends and family let down and lied to and the squandered opportunities for reform bore you, grate on you, outrage you with their narcissism and vanity? Well, you're not half as bored, appalled and stupefied with her own weakness as she is. More, Now, Again is less like a book and more like a nightmarishly extended therapy session on which, against all professional protocols, we have been invited to eavesdrop. Its framework is simple: Wurtzel, anxious to make solid progress on Bitch, begins to take Ritalin, an amphetamine that is commonly prescribed for children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in order to boost her powers of concentration and supplement her antidepressants. Her doctor prescribes four tablets daily, but pretty soon Wurtzel is up to 40, which she grinds up in a handy little contraption she finds in an old-fashioned pharmacy, and then snorts. In flight from the unbearable demands of her New York lifestyle (the friends! the parties! the agony!), she hides out in Florida, where her world shrinks to Ritalin and reading and TV and takeaways, and then simply to Ritalin and her new passion, which is to tweeze hairs out of her legs until large abscesses, \"bulbous and green and crusty\", send her to the emergency room, where dozens of doctors and students crowd around her, mystified. She becomes unhealthily fascinated with Timothy McVeigh and gets arrested for shoplifting; her brief sojourn in the county jail provides one of the book's most wonderfully comic interludes, which sees her asking to keep her prison-issue orange suit as a memento and then threatening to sue her captors for depriving her of Ritalin and magazines. Given that her detention lasts a mere couple of hours, even her lawyer laughs at her. Back in New York, things go from bad to worse, via rehab, relapse, a grotty married man and an even grottier unmarried one, and the arrival on the scene of large quantities of cocaine. One of the lowest moments comes when a bombed-out Wurtzel sleeps through a photoshoot to advertise Coach bags, and is gazumped by fellow contrarian Katie Roiphe. \"I actually like Katie very much,\" she tells us, \"but not her book, which was about date rape hysteria and puritanical feminism, and which I thought was full of sloppy writing and shoddy reasoning.\" A couple of sentences later, she confides: \"This Coach bag thing enwreathes me with envy. Now Katie's picture will be in the pages of Vogue.\" Enwreathes me? Who's the sloppy writer now? Unsurprisingly, Wurtzel's determination to admit to every last act of self-obsession and ruthless disregard for others renders her thoroughly dislikeable. A therapist might ask what she has invested in that wilful alienation, what pay-off there is in placing oneself so firmly beyond others' compassion. Self-hatred is one answer; self-protection is another, because there's a sense that this high-stakes confession will turn us firmly towards her gifts as a writer, gifts that she never appears to doubt. \"I think you're the best fiction writer in our age group,\" she tells Robert Bingham, not far off death by overdose, \"you know, among our contemporaries.\" She adds a conspiratorial note, just for us: \"I am careful to say fiction, because I still hope that I've got non-fiction covered.\" Wurtzel's faith in her talent is not entirely unjustified. Sections of More, Now, Again, like those in Prozac Nation, are both affecting and funny, and her talent for giving voice to the utterly introverted, utterly selfish worlds of addiction and depression is impressive. None of this makes her the best non-fiction writer of her age group, or anyone else's. At times her rat-on-a-wheel dependency, the self-absorption that is called, in the language of rehab, \"terminal uniqueness\", the sight of her bright mind jumping through hoop after hoop of neediness until it implodes, come close to being heart-breaking. But they also mean that she is an intensely limited and curiously unrevealing writer. Other people's therapy, like other people's dreams, is never quite so enthralling as one's own, and that is the lesson that Wurtzel needs to learn. The signs aren't positive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
