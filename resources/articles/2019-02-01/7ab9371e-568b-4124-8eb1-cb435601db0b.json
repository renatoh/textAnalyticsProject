This new-found spirit of cautious compromise represents something of a truce. After all, only last Monday the Newcastle manager refused to rule out the possibility of tendering his resignation if the relegation-threatened club failed to strengthen his squad by the transfer market\u2019s closure on Thursday. Ashley is not a man pushed easily into corners but, for once, an owner maverick even by football\u2019s standards took the hint and an appeasement policy was swiftly initiated. It involved the arrival of Miguel Almir\u00f3n, the Paraguay playmaker, from Atlanta United for a club-record \u00a321m and Antonio Barreca, a loanee left\u2011back from Monaco, and simultaneously raised hopes that Ben\u00edtez might finally extend a contract which expires in May. The 58-year-old at least seems open to the possibility of entering negotiations. \u201cI didn\u2019t say if we don\u2019t sign players I will leave, so I will not say now that, because we\u2019ve signed two players, I will sign,\u201d he said in the lead-up to the trip to Tottenham on Saturday. \u201cWe have plenty of time to sit down and talk about the future. I\u2019m quite relaxed about it. We have to be sure we\u2019re going in the right direction. We have to stay calm.\u201d As a practised politician, he habitually weighs his words carefully but they can be decoded as a message to Ashley that he regards Almir\u00f3n\u2019s arrival as merely the start of a squad strengthening process required to compensate for two years of significant under-investment. \u201cI\u2019m quite pragmatic,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cI\u2019m happier now than one week ago. Why? Because we won against Manchester City on Tuesday and we have brought in two players. These two players, they give us something that we didn\u2019t have. With them we have more chance to improve.\u201d While Barreca could be involved against Spurs, Almir\u00f3n\u2019s debut will have to wait until the trip to Wolves on Monday week as he must first complete visa and work permit formalities. If the pair should help ensure Newcastle avoid falling into the Championship, their presence will be insufficient to fulfil Ben\u00edtez\u2019s ambition of leading the club back into European combat. Indeed he indicated Ashley has done only the bare minimum. \u201cEvery single fan knew we needed a left-back and a No 10,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was obvious so we signed two players in these two positions and we are a little better than we were because I can change some things now and we\u2019ve created competition \u2013 these new faces mean the rest of the players have to compete and it\u2019s always important to have people thinking they need to do better \u2013 but the priority is still to stay up. Don\u2019t forget one thing, it\u2019s not what I wanted; it was what we obviously needed and we\u2019ve signed two players without experience in the Premier League who will need time. But everyone is a little bit happier today.\u201d Before the 2-1 win against Pep Guardiola\u2019s side on Tuesday, Ben\u00edtez described himself as \u201ccold minded\u201d, explaining that switching his brain to a detached, logical setting proved the best antidote against the sort of mistakes frequently made when anxiety and emotion cloud managerial judgment. Yet as Liverpool fans can confirm, their former manager is also a football romantic who thrives on the sort of close bonds with supporters he enjoyed at Anfield and has now replicated at St James\u2019 Park. Much as his trust in Ashley has been eroded and his fears Newcastle may not be sold any time soon have risen, Ben\u00edtez would clearly turn his back on the club with a heavy heart. He has fallen at least half in love with the place and desperately wants to become the first manager to deliver Newcastle a trophy since the Fairs Cup 1969. \u201cThis is a massive city with massive support for our team,\u201d he said on Friday, hinting at glorious, if still distant, possibilities. With protests against Ashley\u2019s regime gaining traction, the Sports Direct owner has real reason to fear an unprecedented slump in season-ticket sales should Ben\u00edtez leave in May. A once unlikely rapprochement seems possible now but much hinges on whether a much-coveted serial trophy winner succumbs to that romantic streak \u2013 or listens to his \u201ccold mind\u201d and breaks free of the ties binding him to Tyneside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
