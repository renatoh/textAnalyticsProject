The British oil trading business likes to promote itself as a decent global citizen. It funds a charitable foundation and sponsored the recent British &amp; Irish Lions rugby tour of South Africa. It employs a top public relations firm, Bell Pottinger, to guard its reputation and it has made energetic use of libel lawyers Carter-Ruck to stop critical articles being published. All this has helped restrict coverage of Trafigura's part in one of the most grotesque environmental scandals of recent times, the uncontrolled dumping of hundreds of tonnes of highly toxic oil waste around Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast, in August 2006. Today the Guardian has published, online, emails which tell the story of Trafigura's responsibility for this terrible and avoidable incident. They also put into context the company's aggressive attempt to cover up its role. The emails are worth reading in full, enraging in their casual contempt for the human and environmental consequences of the oil traders' search for profit at any cost. Tens of thousands of people went to hospital shortly after Trafigura's noxious slurry was poured into sites around the west African city. An unknown number may have died. Yet Trafigura's lawyers confront anyone who questions its version of events, claiming the waste slops were not toxic and that their disposal was entirely a matter for a local contractor. Trafigura launched a libel case against the BBC2's Newsnight programme, demanded the Guardian delete online articles about the scandal and issued legal threats against journalists in Norway and the Netherlands. This attempt to hide from the truth fell apart yesterday when Trafigura offered to reach a settlement with the 31,000 people who have been suing in the British courts for compensation \u2013 one of the biggest group actions in history. This awful story has its roots in the competitive nature of the oil trade, and growing regulation to control its environmental consequences. In 2005, the secret internal emails show, Trafigura's traders saw an opportunity to buy up \"bloody cheap contaminated petrol\" from Mexico and reprocess it using caustic soda to absorb sulphur contaminants \u2013 a polluting method banned in most developed countries. \"Each cargo should make 7m!\", one trader wrote. From the start, the company knew there would be a problem disposing of the foul waste that would be produced. It rejected a Dutch company that would burn it as too expensive. As the emails show, the oil traders came up with a plan to hire a rundown tanker, ready for scrapping, and treat the waste on board. \"I don't know how we would dispose of the slops and I don't imply we would dump them, but for sure there must be some way to pay someone to take them,\" one wrote. That person was found in the Ivory Coast, but had no experience in chemical treatment. The caustic slops were carried off in tanker lorries and dumped in landfill sites around the city. The consequences were horrific and long-lasting. Trafigura's response was to embark on an extraordinary attempt to bully the media using the British courts. This week the company, which last year made a profit of $440m, even objected strongly to the publication of a report from a UN human rights special rapporteur that criticised Trafigura for potentially \"stifling independent reporting and public criticism\". If the settlement is agreed, victims who have taken part in the class action will now get compensation. Greenpeace and Amnesty International are calling for Trafigura to be prosecuted for homicide or grievous bodily harm in the Netherlands. Slowly, the company is being brought to justice, despite its denials and disgraceful attempts to hide from what it has done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
