Marshall Billingslea, the US special envoy for arms control, said he had flown to Helsinki on Monday to meet the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, on the understanding that there could be an imminent breakthrough in discussions on whether to extend the 2010 New Start treaty, which limits the number of deployed strategic warheads on either side, and which expires in February. \u201cWe believe that there is an agreement in principle at the highest levels of our two governments. That\u2019s why I cut short my trip to Asia and made a beeline for Helsinki when the Russians called and wanted to sit down,\u201d Billingslea told a Washington thinktank, in an apparent suggestion that there had been an informal verbal agreement between Trump and Putin. He added the US condition for extension would be a verified freeze on the complete arsenals of both countries, including non-strategic (short-range or \u201ctactical\u201d) warheads. That condition was quickly and emphatically rejected by Moscow. The foreign ministry was quoted by the RIA Novosti agency as calling Billingslea\u2019s claim a \u201cdelusion\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d. Ryabkov said a freeze was \u201cunacceptable\u201d adding that Moscow would not approve a New Start treaty extension before the US election on 3 November. \u201cIf the Americans need to report to their superiors something about which they allegedly agreed with the Russian Federation before their elections, then they will not get it,\u201d Ryabkov said. In his remarks Billingslea suggested that Ryabkov might be out of touch with the Russian\u2019s leader\u2019s wishes. \u201cI am hopeful that that sort of gentleman\u2019s agreement \u2013 that arrangement that we believe has been reached at the highest levels \u2013 will ultimately need to percolate down through their system so that my counterpart hopefully will be authorized to negotiate,\u201d he told the Heritage Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to strike this deal. We could strike it tomorrow, in fact, but Moscow\u2019s going to have to show the political will to do so as well.\u201d The US had previously insisted that China be included in any future arms control negotiations rather than extending the bilateral arrangements in New Start, but Billingslea has dropped that demand in recent weeks, accepting that trilateral talks could be arranged later. Alexandra Bell, a former state department official and now senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said the pre-election urgency followed \u201cliterally months of the Trump administration saying there\u2019s plenty of time to do this \u2013 there\u2019s no rush\u201d. The Trump administration has been keen to showcase foreign policy achievements before the election, but over the past four years, it has pulled out of three arms control agreements and signed none. James Acton, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Russia was unlikely to agree to a freeze that affected its non-strategic warheads, a category in which it has a big advantage over the US and Nato. \u201cRussia is not going to agree to something that addresses the US\u2019s biggest concern on Russia and get nothing in return,\u201d Acton said. \u201cIf there is a deal to be made, we\u2019re going to have to give something to the Russians in return. And most of us think that the price is probably something to do with ballistic missile defense.\u201d Senior parliamentarians from across Europe wrote to their US counterparts on Tuesday urging them to support a New Start extension. In the letter, organised by the European Leadership Network, the MPs from 19 countries said: \u201cAs officials who strive to protect the health and security of millions of European citizens, we feel distressed by the possibility that New Start may lapse in less than six months.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
