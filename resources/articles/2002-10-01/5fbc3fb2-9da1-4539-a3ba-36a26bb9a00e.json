Totti, who has scored five goals in Roma's last two games, will also miss Saturday's game against Yugoslavia in Naples after the Italian team doctor Andrea Ferretti decided that he had no hope of participating in either match, having examined the player at the team's training camp near Florence. \"I never had any hope of Francesco being fit for the game in Wales but we want to keep to the practice that players should report here as a matter of clarity,\" said the Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni. The Northern Ireland assistant manager Jimmy Harvey has decided not to travel to their qualifier against Spain on Saturday. Harvey, also the manager of Morecambe, will instead join his club for their game against Dagenham and Redbridge. Harvey and Sammy McIlroy, the Northern Ireland manager, are banned from both touchline and dressing rooms after they were sent off within 20 minutes during their game against Malta last October. Harvey will join the squad on Sunday ahead of their match against the Ukraine a week today. The Tottenham Hotspur winger Matthew Etherington has joined the club's lengthy injury list after twisting an ankle in training. The former Peterborough player, an ever-present in Spurs' first nine games of the season, had to pull out of the 2-1 win at Blackburn on Sunday and has been ruled out of action for 10 days. The Hull owner Adam Pearson yesterday revealed that Jan Molby offered to resign after the club's dreadful recent run of form. Having started the season as favourites for promotion from the Third Division the Tigers have won just two of their opening 12 matches, and Molby has been told that he will be sacked unless results improve soon. \"We have had a long chat about the situation,\" said Pearson. \"Jan offered to step down but I have told him to see what happens in a few weeks. I still believe he can turn things around. We have had an extremely disappointing start but we all still believe that we have the players to turn things around. However it is going to need an enormous amount of hard work by the manager to put the confidence back into the players.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
