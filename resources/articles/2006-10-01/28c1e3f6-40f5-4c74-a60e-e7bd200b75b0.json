Hall also accepted that \"vast amounts of money have been wasted on players\" during his and Shepherd's tenure, though he blames previous managers for that. Hall, 73, is in semi-retirement in Spain but was told of the anti-Shepherd chants during Newcastle's 1-0 defeat at Middlesbrough on Sunday. \"I believe it has been blown out of all proportion by sections of the media,\" he said. \"Like I did before, Freddy Shepherd has backed every Newcastle manager to the limit of the club's resources. And, like me, he cannot legislate for what happens on the field. That is up to the manager and the players. \"It is clear to me and everyone that some of the players brought by previous managers have not been good enough. Our fans must look in amazement at some of the vast sums paid for players who are not good enough for this football club.\" Some of those fans would doubtless counter that Hall and his son Douglas have taken vast sums out of the club. Between 1998 and 2005 they made \u00a334m in sales of Newcastle shares and dividends, and Hall Sr wants to sell his remaining 41%. On current valuation that would net the family around another \u00a340m. But it is Shepherd who runs the club and takes the stick. Ironically he is also hampering Hall's ambitions to sell up as any buyer would want Shepherd's 29%. With speculation regarding a possible takeover a daily occurrence the club issued a statement yesterday saying: \"The company has not received a formal offer proposal from any entity.\" Shepherd is known to be a reluctant seller, although should there be further criticism during tonight's League Cup tie at St James' Park against Portsmouth, he will surely start to reconsider his position. The chairman, moreover, will have his eyes on the crowd as well as his ears following the six-year low attendance against Bolton. As ever, a couple of wins would alter the mood and Hall said he thinks Roeder deserves to be given an extended run. \"Glenn is one of the most honest and sincere men I have met in football and I have the highest regard for him,\" he said. \"He has got Newcastle in his heart and he feels the anguish the same as the supporters when results are not going our way. I am sure Glenn will get it right, but he needs the strength of the fans to get him through. We have also got to look at ourselves and may appoint a director of football to take some pressure off the manager.\" Hall and Roeder have mentioned the benefits a director of football before but of more pressing concern is the size of the squad. Roeder said Shola Ameobi, struggling for fitness, \"may not make it\" to the transfer window and with the on-loan Giuseppe Rossi returning to Manchester United then, leaving only two recognised forwards in Obafemi Martins and Antoine Sibierski. Albert Luque would be another but the \u00a311m signing is off the radar and fits Hall's \"wasted money\" criterion. Kieron Dyer has played in a closed-doors practice and if unscathed this morning he may make the bench tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
