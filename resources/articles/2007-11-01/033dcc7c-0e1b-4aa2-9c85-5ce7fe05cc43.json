Strangely, \"getting Paris right\" is not necessarily a question of filming in the French capital, but rather of being true to the \"idea\" of Paris. Let me explain. When Vincente Minnelli made An American in Paris, he never shot a single frame there, apart from the opening panoramic shot over the Grand Palais and the Seine. He recreated it all back in Hollywood. Yet his phantasmagorical Paris strikes to the core, for he has understood the magic of the city like no other. A few years later, it was the turn of the new wave's young Turks to tackle Paris. They were the first to show its beauty of grime and simmering anger. In Bande \u00e0 Part, carefree Jean-Luc Godard captured Paris in swift and urgent camera moves taken while running or driving. But things can really go wrong when a film-maker ends up being paralysed by the subject and starts homaging other greats, as Woody Allen did in Everybody Says I Love You, paying tribute to Minnelli and Donen. On the left bank, with Notre-Dame in the background, Goldie Hawn, propped up by special effects, dances above and around a stiff Woody Allen: poor stand-ins for Leslie Caron and Gene Kelly, or Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Agn\u00e8s Poirier Moscow As car chases go, it's not bad - Jason Bourne, pursued by a Russian killer, grinds his taxi through the streets of Moscow. The chase weaves past the onion domes of St Basil's cathedral and along Moscow's frozen river embankment, before ending, messily, in a tunnel. The only problem with the sequence in Paul Greengrass's The Bourne Supremacy is that the Russian assassin has a British accent. Oh well. Moscow residents also query whether it would ever be possible to have a car chase in Moscow, given that it has the worst traffic jams of any world city. Moscow has featured prominently in both Hollywood and, of course, Russian films for some time. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, Moscow was not always Moscow. Dr Zhivago - David Lean's 1960s film version of Boris Pasternak's novel - was actually filmed in Madrid. Similarly, Gorky Park, the 1983 movie, was shot in Finland. The real Gorky Park in Moscow is something of a disappointment, and given how few people visit these days it would take a while for a body to be discovered. Film critics complain that the Hollywood depiction of Moscow rarely goes beyond the cliches of mafia, prostitutes and KGB killers. \"It's unrealistic and wrong,\" Anna Franklin, a Russian-based film critic, says. \"The way Russian and foreign films portray Moscow is very different. It's often Hollywood fantasy using the streets of Moscow as a background.\" She adds: \"I've never actually seen anybody with their fingers chopped off. I'm afraid to use the London Underground, but I feel perfectly safe here in Moscow.\" Franklin contrasts Hollywood's treatment of Moscow with that of Russian film-makers, who prefer to depict sensitive, ordinary middle-class Russian life. My Step Brother Frankenstein - Valery Todorovsky's acclaimed melodrama about the effect on a family of the return of a young, wounded veteran from Chechnya - comes in for special praise. Luke Harding Rome \"When you think that nine out of 10 Italian movies are set in Rome, well, Rome is Italian cinema,\" says Valerio Cappelli, who reports on film for Corriere della Sera. In some of the best-known films in Italian cinema history - Rossellini's Rome, Open City, Fellini's La Dolce Vita; or Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary, the city provides an unavoidably intrusive backdrop. In others, like Fellini's Roma, it is really the star. Yet, as Cappelli remarks, realistic portrayals of contemporary Rome are few and far between. Roma was a deliberate caricature - a lyrical (though essentially faithful) representation of the spirit of the place. Dear Diary was realistic to the point of being a travelogue in places, but the capital it portrays is an abnormal one - Rome in August, without the people, the noise and the traffic. Gliding through the city on his Vespa, however, Moretti picks up on the main cliche employed by film-makers when depicting Rome. The arches of the Colosseum flick across the screen horizontally in the background as it is circled by the subject in the foreground. It's the corniest shot of the lot. John Hooper Los Angeles Since Los Angeles is the world capital of the movie business and a city you are duty-bound to despise, it's not surprising that its most indelibly famous civic movie chronicles, in the most self-hating manner, its own municipal creation-myth: Roman Polanski and Robert Towne's Chinatown. The 1905 acquisition of the Owens Valley's water rights was temporally relocated by Towne (an LA native) to the late 30s and couched in a form invented especially for LA by Raymond Chandler. Yes, it is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest American movies, but no, it isn't historically accurate (votes were taken, municipal bonds issued; the water-rights acquisition was finessed by scheming plutocrats, but certainly not stolen). Better, I think, to add to Chinatown other, gentler movies that work neighbourhood by neighbourhood, like the Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski (Hollywood, Malibu), Charles Burnett's Killer of Sheep (Watts), PT Anderson's Boogie Nights and Magnolia (San Fernando Valley), Towne's adaptation of John Fante's Ask the Dust (old, demolished Bunker Hill) and the movie that subsumes all other movies about LA: Thom Anderson's essay-film masterpiece Los Angeles Plays Itself, which examines how the movies see LA, and how lost LA is preserved in old movies. John Patterson New York \"He adored New York City. He idolised it all out of proportion.\" The opening line of Manhattan is Woody Allen's, but plenty of great directors agree. Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock, John Cassavetes, Elia Kazan, Abel Ferrara and Spike Lee all made New York itself the star. In Scorsese's words: \"The city has become the great studio.\" Grand Central is as busy now as it was in North By Northwest, but subway trains have improved since The Taking of Pelham One Two Three and The Warriors. There are plenty of yellow cabs, but there's no longer much scum for Robert De Niro's Taxi Driver to clean off the streets, which aren't as mean as they used to be. Little Italy is for tourists. These days, Times Square is more Spider-Man than Midnight Cowboy, although it still has the \"neurotic energy\" Alexander Mackendrick observed in Sweet Smell of Success. You can breakfast outside Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue like Audrey Hepburn, but if you're tempted to stand over a subway grate waiting for a gust of hot air, like Marilyn Monroe in the Seven Year Itch, remember that the scene was filmed on the 20th Century Fox lot in California. Time Out New York film critic Josh Rothkopf names The Squid and the Whale and Birth as two recent movies that get the city right. \"Birth captures Greenpoint and the Upper East Side really well,\" he says, \"which means understanding class differences between the neighbourhoods. Real New York movies are about a style of living, more than any landmark or building.\" When it comes to getting it wrong, he says one current film stands out: \"American Gangster feels phoney to me. It looks like the Beastie Boys Sabotage video, although it was shot in the Bronx. There's even a digitally superimposed Twin Towers in the background in one shot.\" Andrew Purcell Rio de Janeiro Torn between vast wealth, natural beauty and extreme poverty and violence, locals often refer to Rio de Janeiro as the \"split city\". In few places is this more obvious than on the big screen, where Rio de Janeiro has spent the last 50 years alternating between its onscreen status as a beach paradise or a den of iniquity and violence. On one hand you have what critic Marcelo Janot calls the \"postcard films\" - such as Bossa Nova - portraying a carefree, seaside paradise. On the other you find films like City of God offering up a Dantesque cesspit of ultra-violence. \"Brazilian cinema has not yet found a way to unite the postcard vision of Rio with the neo-realist vision, the reality,\" says Janot, head of the popular Brazilian website Criticos. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the cinema's frequent allusions to Rio slum life, Janot believes. Just take the 1959 film Black Orpheus, \"where it's as if people in Rio spent their whole time dancing the samba and singing\". Or this year's Tropa de Elite, which depicts an unenviable vision of this seaside city. A mixture, Janot says, of the \"scum of humanity with the corrupt bourgeois\". Tom Phillips London It used to be that Hollywood movies set in London needed to have an establishing shot of Westminster bridge, complete with black cabs and red Routemasters sailing sedately over it. Nowadays, that old cliche has been replaced with a new one: the ubiquitous shot of the Swiss Re \"gherkin\" building, used most grievously in the awful Basic Instinct 2, in which scenes actually took place in the building, its criss-cross design spuriously visible on the windows. Movies featuring upscale luxury-tourist London locations always make me quail, like Woody Allen's Match Point or Richard Curtis's Love Actually - although they are arguably in the tradition of Hitchcock's lurid strike-a-light London, seen in Frenzy or The Man Who Knew Too Much. Cockney gangster films tend, to my eye, to make a point of their Larndarn settings with too much parochialism and pedantry: even, I think, John Mackenzie's hugely admired The Long Good Friday. My favourite London films are those that make a knight's-move away from obviousness and recognisability. Antonioni's Blow-Up traces a thrilling, occult psycho-geography. Nic Roeg's Performance and Bruce Robinson's Withnail and I disclose a witty, scary raffishness in the pre-gentrified west and north. Stephen Poliakoff's work divides people, but in Close My Eyes, his view of the new Docklands and the lush, almost tropical downriver locations of the south-west are tremendously achieved. Michael Winterbottom's Wonderland is a gutsy and real vision of London, and an honourable mention has to go to Jack Rosenthal's tremendous made-for-TV parable-comedy The Chain, taking us up the housing ladder from Hackney to Knightsbridge. Peter Bradshaw Mumbai Any film set in Mumbai these days relies on the celluloid cliche of the gangster. Last year's comedy smash Lage Raho Munnabhai was about a city thug who redeems himself through reading Gandhi. Shakespeare's Macbeth, too, was reinvented in Indian cinema: again in the ganglands of Mumbai in Maqbool. Ram Gopal Verma, the enfant terrible of Bollywood, captured this uberviolent Mumbai best in Shiva - remarkable for a scene where a man has a nail hammered into his head. This focus on Mumbai's criminal fraternity has made the unlit street the city's most recognisable celluloid image. The other is Mumbai's Hajji Ali mosque; built on an island linked by a finger of land, it features in almost every wide-angle shot of the city. A number of important movies about the changing face of India have used Mumbai's urban life as a backdrop. Page 3 and Dil Chate Hai were both important movies about the changing pattern of relationships in India, but Mumbai was used as city scenery rather than being central to the plot. Mumbai's teeming slums and squalid environs rarely feature in modern Indian film-making, which prefers movies about escapism rather than realism. The exception is Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay, about the bittersweet loss of innocence experienced by the city's poor. What has almost disappeared from Mumbai cinema is the mild-mannered movie about the city's upwardly mobile middle-class, who form the bulk of cinemagoers. Film-makers such Basu Chatterjee in the 1970s lingered on the travails of newly married couples seeking to escape from the suffocating embrace of Indian tradition. \"The gangster movie has come to dominate films set in Bombay. Whether it is the car chase or just the everyday violence, there's little else the city is known for these days,\" says Subash K Jha, film critic for the Times of India. \"It is a terrible cliche to live with.\" Randeep Ramesh Tokyo Films set in Tokyo have gone through as many artistic metamorphoses as the city has physical ones in the past 60 years. Capturing the essence of a sprawling metropolis of more than 8 million people and multiple \"centres\" is never easy. In Always and Always 2, Takashi Yamazaki opts to portray the city not as it is, but as millions of baby boomers would like to remember it as they ride a wave of nostalgia for all things 1950s. Grittier alternatives to the syrupy comfort zone occupied by the likes of Always include Pornostar and Scoutman, which explore juvenile delinquency and gangland crime in the Tokyo teen mecca of Shibuya. The current fascination with Japanese pop culture is unlikely to result in many more foreign films of the calibre of Lost in Translation, though. Maintaining a crew and cast is notoriously expensive, and even film-makers on a big budget find themselves mired in bureaucracy before they can even think about, say, a choreographed crowd scene. We are more likely to end up with the cliche-ridden attempts such as Into the Sun or glimpses snatched on the hoof, such as those in the Hollywood remake of The Grudge. Rather than pinpointing glaring errors, some critics charge film-makers with misrepresenting the city's mood. The Tokyo of Into the Sun is a yakuza-infested pit, while in Tokyo Drift, it is a near- uninhabited shell. Says film critic Don Morton: \"Few even try for authenticity.\" In the end, Tokyo's sheer scale may be the undoing of any serious attempt to define the city as it is today. As Mark Schilling, a film reviewer for the Japan Times, puts it: \"There are all kinds of Tokyos.\" Perhaps, Schilling adds, it should be left to Godzilla, as he lurches from one landmark to another, to act as our best cinematic guide to Tokyo. Justin McCurry Beijing Beijing on screen runs the gamut from spectacular period pieces about imperial life to gritty kitchen-sink dramas about drug addiction, infidelity, political protest and abortion. Most western films go for period, so for a more up-to-date image, you have to check out domestic film-makers, though most of those that make it out to western audiences tend to be connected to controversies - such as Beijing Bicycle and the domestically banned Summer Palace, which encompasses the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. According to film critic Fang Li, the censors make it difficult for directors to use the techniques of critical realism in Beijing. He says the truest representation of the contradictions of modern life in the capital was a film called Lost in Beijing - but the censors insisted on cuts to 53 scenes and demanded that the English title of the film not mention Beijing. It is released now as Apple. Another critic, Lu Zhang, explains that film has yet to catch up with the city's transformation, with its stunning skyscrapers, migrant workers, traffic jams and the eclipse of the traditional way of life. Perhaps the archetypal Beijing film genre is the \"hutong\", or alleyway drama. Sunflower, Public Toilet and Shower fit in this category. While these movies are often sentimental about the loss of traditional family life, art films are less squeamish about social problems and formerly taboo topics. Quitting is the true story of an actor's effort to kick his drug habit, while other underground work, such as Lanyu, explores the Beijing gay scene. For most residents, however, the film that comes closest to their day to day gossip is probably Cellphone, an intoxicating and thoroughly modern mix of infidelity, technology, money and moral confusion. Jonathan Watts Berlin Berliners were flattered by the depiction of their city in The Bourne Supremacy as a gritty and non-stop power hungry metropolis. But the image created in the film could hardly have been further from the truth. Anyone commuting here knows that when Matt Damon ran out of his hotel just off Unter den Linden and on to the S-Bahn train, a journey that would normally take 15 or 20 minutes was over in seconds. In one second he is at Friedrichstrasse, the next he is racing along the Kurfurstendamm having careered between two different ends of the city in a miraculous time frame. More traditionally, Berlin is the cinematic repository of its turbulent history. The wartorn A Foreign Affair was filmed in the genuine rubble of post-war Berlin; in Wings of Desire, Wim Wenders made the most of the vast empty bomb-blasted barren plains around Potsdamer Platz. Often when Berlin has been used as a backdrop for films very little has needed to be changed - Tempelhof Airport was the backdrop for The Big Lift just as it was for the real-life airlift, as well as for the Billy Wilder film One, Two, Three. That kind of authenticity is, oddly the result of communism - the West Berlin authorities were so keen to keep their city on the map during the Iron Curtain years that they ensured production costs stayed low. So it was a major disappointment for locals when The Good German was shot, not in Berlin and Potsdam, where the story is set, but on soundstages elsewhere, and in Universal Studios in an effort to create a \"film noir\" style. It's got little to do with the real Berlin. Kate Connolly \u00b7 This article was amended on Friday November 16 2007. We referred to The Bourne Conspiracy; we meant The Bourne Supremacy. This has been corrected. \u00b7 This article was amended on Saturday November 24 2007. The article above about cities in films included Federico Fellini's 8\u00bd as one of those that has Rome as a backdrop. In fact 8\u00bd was shot mainly in a studio and the action takes place in a spa. We should have cited Fellini's La Dolce Vita instead.
