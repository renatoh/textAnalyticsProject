Only 1,420 hectares (3,507 acres) of trees were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government\u2019s target of 5,000 hectares in the period, with smaller areas in Wales and Northern Ireland, at 500 hectares and 240 hectares respectively. The total tree cover of the UK is unchanged at 10% in England, 15% in Wales, 19% in Scotland and 8% in Northern Ireland. However Scotland did far better, with 11,200 hectares planted, taking the UK\u2019s total to 13,400 hectares, the highest level overall in the last decade. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has promised a national campaign of tree-planting, with pledges from the government of \u00a350m for 10m new rural trees and \u00a310m for 130,000 urban trees by 2022. Setting out measures the UK will need to implement to achieve the net-zero carbon target, which is shortly to be enshrined in legislation, the Committee on Climate Change said 1.5bn trees would be needed by 2050, equivalent to an area of 30,000 hectares every year, with 15% of crop land turned to tree-planting and growing plants for fuel. The Woodland Trust, which planted half of the new broadleaf woodland for England last year, called for much greater government support for tree-planting. Farmers in England face complex choices over tree-planting, because they get little support for it owing to the way the government has implemented the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy. They are also uncertain over Brexit \u2013 the government has promised \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d in a new agricultural system after Brexit, but there is little detail on how this will work and the new \u201cenvironmental land management contracts\u201d will only be phased in from 2024, which leaves a gap in the potential support available. Abi Bunker, director of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said: \u201cIt will be a challenge, it will cost money, it will mean tough choices, but the human race is at a crossroads for our environmental future. To avoid climate breakdown, we have to act. If the framework is in place, meeting the ambition of 17% tree cover [for the UK] is achievable.\u201d The Soil Association said that the way in which the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy has been implemented in England has helped to discourage tree-planting by farmers, and called for any new post-Brexit system to provide much more support. \u201cAt the very least, future agricultural policy should not disadvantage farms pursuing agroforestry,\u201d the organisation said at a parliamentary event this week. \u201cAgroforestry is not a short-term investment for farmers.\u201d Guy Shrubsole, trees campaigner at Friends of the Earth, which is campaigning to double tree cover, said: \u201cOur government talks the talk on fighting climate breakdown, but these figures show that planting of new trees, and replacing those felled, in England is [near] a historic low. Trees are going to form a key part in getting the country to net zero emissions, so we need to see a huge improvement in how quickly trees are being planted.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cOur forest and woodlands are vital for providing timber, reducing flood risk and protecting our wildlife, which is why planting more trees is at the heart of our ambition to protect the environment for future generations. This is why we are introducing our new environment bill, which will include ambitious legislative measures to take direct action to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
