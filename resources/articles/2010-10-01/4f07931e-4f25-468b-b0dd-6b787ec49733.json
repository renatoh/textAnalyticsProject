The reception will be a clear demonstration of the prime minister's full engagement with the England 2018 World Cup bid and marks another gear change for the campaign ahead of the 2 December vote. England 2018 executives regard the meeting as so critical to the success of the bid that the date has been kept a closely guarded secret. When a spokesman was approached with a request for comment yesterday in response to the information that the meeting was going ahead, England 2018 refused to discuss the matter. Digger understands that due to Blatter's travel commitments the final schedule has yet to be signed off, but a source involved said that the visit is due to take place next week. A spokeswoman for Cameron declined to comment and Fifa executives did not return calls. Blatter's principal commitment next week is the series of international matches. It is not yet known if his trip to London will take in England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on Tuesday, but the timing of the summit highlights the priority Cameron has placed on meeting Fifa's president. Blatter's visit comes after the Tory party conference in Birmingham, which does not conclude until today, and the final announcement of the comprehensive spending review to parliament on 20 October. Cameron had been unfairly criticised for his decision not to host the Fifa technical delegation in August. The duty then fell to the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, after Cameron had personally sought Blatter's leave to remain on holiday in Cornwall rather than to rush back to London to receive the Fifa inspectors. Blatter was not part of the technical delegation, which was made up of Fifa functionaries and headed by the Chilean football federation president, Harold Mayne-Nicholls. Cameron's decision to stay away from official business was entirely justified with the birth of his daughter on 24 August, only 24 hours after the Fifa inspectors had arrived in the UK. A demonstration of Cameron's enthusiasm for the bid, beyond the \u00a3300m of government guarantees, is thought to be vital to its chances of success. Russia's campaign \u2013 which is, alongside Spain, England's biggest rival to host the tournament in 2018 \u2013 has made great play of the engagement of Russia's president-turned-prime minister, Vladimir Putin. Blatter has termed Russia \"a big power\" whom \"you cannot deny if they bid for something\". England must hope Cameron finds a way of persuading Blatter to do just that. Horse for national course Those puzzling over the England call-up for Bolton Wanderers' hefty 33-year-old Kevin Davies have their answer: English teams need the ball to be lumped forward for a big man. That is the conclusion the Football Association came to after its sides reached the tournament finals at the Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 European Championships. Digger can reveal that the postmortem of those three tournaments conducted by an FA technical study group quickly discovered that players in each of those three teams squandered possession more than the other seven finalists. This happened in all three areas of the pitch \u2013 defence, midfield and attack \u2013 proving that even those Englishmen who have spent all of their early careers in the Premier League's academy system are not sufficiently comfortable on the ball to play it on the ground. The senior side are no more technically proficient, hence Fabio Capello's reliance on Emile Heskey and in his absence now, Davies. You do not need to have won seven titles and a European Cup to recognise that it is better to lose the ball in the opponent's half than in your own. Pompey's grand auto levy Portsmouth fans have seen their cars towed away after parking them near Fratton Park, incurring penalties in excess of \u00a3400 to get them back. The charges have been incurred on land belonging to the club's former owner, Sasha Gaydamak. His advisers say he does not set the release fees as the operation is outsourced to Whites Car Park Solutions. Given that successive governments have taken steps to clamp down on clampers \u2013 the issue is to be submitted to parliament in the Freedom Bill this month \u2013 Gaydamak must have known this was the consequence of his outsourcing. Whites had no one available to comment last night. Premier League laid bare The events that led to the formation of the Premier League \u2013 and the missed opportunities that followed \u2013 will be laid bare in a talk by Alex Fynn at the Birkbeck College Sport Business Centre next Wednesday. Fynn, a former Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive, was a co-writer of the Blueprint for The Future of Professional Football on which the Premier League was (very loosely) based, and will no doubt have plenty to say on the subject."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
