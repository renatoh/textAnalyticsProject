Until the 1970s, draconian censorship laws enforced by a one-armed chief censor (no, really) effectively prohibited depictions of nudity and sex. Both were no-fly zones for Australian film-makers. Inaction can also be crippling. George Miller believes inertia from the Rudd/Labor years prevented him from using the rights to DC comic books to build an Australian talent house like Weta (Peter Jackson\u2019s visual effects company, responsible for Deadpool, Lord of the Rings). One of the earliest examples of government interference with the local film industry is also one of the most outrageous. The popular and internationally successful 1906 outlaw epic The Story of the Kelly Gang painted Victorian police in a negative light; its sympathies lay on the side of Kelly, who was hung 26 years before the film was originally released. Politicians responded six years later by introducing a ban on the production of bushranger films in New South Wales, stifling what could have been a burgeoning genre in Australian cinema. The ban was only lifted in the 1940s. The Story of the Kelly Gang is a milestone production, not just here but globally. This column has explored classic Australian cinema \u2013 the great, the good, the bad, the ugly \u2013 every week for 112 consecutive weeks. We reckon that\u2019s enough to keep your to-watch backlist ticking along for a while. What better way to conclude the series than to go back to the very beginning \u2013 not just the first full-length narrative feature film made in this country but the first made anywhere in the world. A certain parochial pleasure can be derived from the knowledge feature film-making began not in Hollywood studios but in paddocks and backyards in Victoria. The film\u2019s narrative is a familiar one, depicting the adventures and eventual demise of Australia\u2019s most famous outlaw. The Kelly gang pester police and rob various people (but never women). Ned dies at the end in a hail of gunfire during a shoot-out at Glenrowan hotel. The Story of the Kelly Gang was produced by a family of well-known show business people, the Taits, and believed to be directed by the Castlemaine-born Charles Tait. The vast majority of it has been lost. The most recent discovery of its footage (in the UK in 2006) unearthed a seven-minute single-take sequence that forms a substantial part of what remains, which amounts to a little under 20 minutes. Accompanying the film\u2019s original release was a program audiences bought at cinemas or newsagencies, which included a scene-by-scene breakdown. Nowadays viewers would cry \u201cspoiler!\u201d but thank God they didn\u2019t back then \u2013 the book proved instrumental in the National Film &amp; Sound Archive\u2019s ability to order the surviving footage (a restored version arrived on DVD in 2007). A scene that takes place inside the pub, where a drinking session turns into a shoot-out, demonstrates some of the technological limitations of the time. This moment is unusually bright, as if it were filmed in a sunny wide open space. As a matter of fact, it was. Artificial lighting in the early years of the 20th century could not pass muster through the lens of a camera. Scenes that were based inside had to be completed using sets built outside, resulting in a trippy combination of interior and exterior locations. The aforementioned seven-minute scene demonstrates a surprising degree of sophistication, particularly in shot perspective and the arrangement of foreground and background elements. The frame captures the gang holding up people outside a building, as well as space to the side of that building the characters cannot see. On the left is a shallow area close to the camera. On the right a deep one (including a driveway-like area) requiring more time for somebody to move from the rear to the front of it. Our attention is directed according to which parts of the frame contain the most action, a primitive form of editing that actually requires no editing at all. It would be problematic to say The Story of the Kelly Gang holds up well, given so little of it has survived. Nitrate film is a volatile medium with a finite shelf life. As Quentin Tarantino reminded us in Inglourious Basterds, it is also flammable. Over 90% of Australia\u2019s silent film history self-destructed. Enough of it remains, however, to give us an idea of what watching the film would have been like. The Story of the Kelly Gang ran for over an hour at a time when films rarely exceeded 20 minutes. What a fine example of cinematic innovation; what a great reminder that Australians have been pioneers in this space since the beginning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
