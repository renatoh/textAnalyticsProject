Being top of the Premiership obviously matters more, but a win is a win, especially in a local derby and particularly when it comes from a try with 79 minutes of this Group A game showing on the stadium clock. Bath have not left this stadium victorious since March 1998 but twice yesterday they pulled themselves level and looked to be favourites until Bristol threw off the shackles of 10 minutes of unrelenting defence to begin the move that put Marko Stanojevic in at the corner. Bath had tried everything. They opted for scrums instead of penalties and then kicked for lineouts rather than the posts. But one fumble was enough. The ball was hoisted into the gale and way down field. \"That never-give-up attitude has filtered right down through the club,\" said Paul Hull, normally the backs coach but put in charge for the day by Richard Hill. After concentrating Bristol's efforts on surviving in the Premiership last season, the head coach has broadened his horizons, but they still do not include the EDF Energy Cup - unsurprising really when his board of directors has set eighth place in the league as a minimum requirement. So after beating Wasps to go top of the table a week ago, Bristol's first XV were packed off on holiday and Hull was given charge of a team including 12 changes. Vaughan Going was not among them, having been released from his contract so he can join Northampton. There were still eight internationals in the starting line-up, but not many household names outside the west country. However, they must have thought they would coast home after going into the interval level at 8-8 having battered their way into the wind . They had played the more constructive rugby thanks to a solid lineout but had an ally in Bath's Australian fly-half, Chris Malone. Twice in the first 10 minutes he kicked the ball dead from his own 22-metre line and when he did find a decent touch, from a penalty, Geraint Lewis nicked the throw to set up Bristol's opening try. Alfie To'oala and Nathan Budgett were involved in a 40-metre canter before a back got hands on the ball. However, the final flourish went to a forward, the prop Jason Hobson, who just about made the line from 10 metres out. Malone was in the sin-bin for a trip when Bath pulled alongside for the first time. Shaun Berne, a more thoughtful Australian option, found touch five metres out and Duncan Bell was at the bottom of the pile when the rolling maul finally came to a halt. But with the wind at their backs it seemed Bristol would surely dominate the second half, especially as Walter Pozzebon put them 13-8 up in the 46th minute with his first try for the club. The Italy centre took a short pass from the fly-half, Danny Gray, and slid in from five metres. No domination, however. Four minutes later the Bath scrum-half, Andy Williams, caught everyone napping with a tapped penalty and scooted 50 metres to within touching distance of the line before David Lemi finally dragged him down, only for Michael Stephenson to pick up the pieces. With Malone's conversion the sides were level at 15-15 and with 15 minutes to go Bath began their siege. That they failed to score from such unrelenting pressure was not lost on their acting head coach, Steve Meehan, but the Australian seemed to finger a compatriot when it came to analysing the defeat. \"I think we put ourselves under enormous pressure in the first half,\" he said. \"Individually we did things that are unacceptable at this level.\" Bristol Stortoni (Arscott, 76); Stanojevic, Pozzebon, Reay, Lemi; Gray, O'Riordan; Clarke (Irish, 67), Blaney (Nelson, 71), Hobson (Nicholls, 73), Sambucetti (Attwood, 78), Budgett, To'oala (Martin-Redman, 60), Short (capt), Lewis.
