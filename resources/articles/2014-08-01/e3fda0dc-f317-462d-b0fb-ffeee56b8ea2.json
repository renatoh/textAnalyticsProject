A low-scoring bonanza, only Jim Furyk of the top 40 players on the leaderboard shot over par. Best of day was Bernd Wiesberger, whose 65 ensures he\u2019s out in the final pairing tomorrow. He\u2019ll be trading blows with the world number one, Rory McIlroy, who wasn\u2019t at his best for most of the round, but stepped it up towards the close when he needed to. But it won\u2019t just be about those two. Look at the other names lurking, waiting for the leading pair to slip! Please join me tomorrow for what promises to be a white-knuckle ride, as several of the world\u2019s best golfers take one last shot at glory in 2014! -13: McIlroy -12: Wiesberger -11: Fowler -10: Mickelson, Day -9: Oosthuizen, Stenson, Ilonen, Palmer -8: Donaldson, DeLaet, Stricker -7: Mahan, Scott, Chappell, Westwood, Luiten, Furyk -6: Snedeker, Willett, Haas, Dubuisson McIlroy splashes out from the bunker, not particularly well, it has to be said. He\u2019s left with a eight-footer for his birdie, but at least it\u2019s uphill. Day next, and he makes a better fist of it. Only just. Six feet perhaps. Rory to putt first, a little right-to-left break. And he sends the ball into the hole, though for a microsecond it looks like escaping off to the left. He punches the air in a mixture of relief, determination and exhaustion. He\u2019ll go into the final day one shot clear at -13 after shooting a 67. Day makes birdie too, finishing a difficult day two shots in credit, with a 69, at -10. The 18th cleared, the final pairing play their final approaches of the day. Jason Day first. He dumps a heavy long iron into the bunker to the front of the green. Rory McIlroy follows him in with a 5-iron! McIlroy eagled here with dismissive ease yesterday. Another twist at the end of this absorbing day\u2019s golf! Palmer\u2019s chip snags in another patch of rough in between ball and green. It rolls apologetically onto the apron. He takes out putter, but sends that one six foot past. He\u2019ll not want to drop a shot here. That\u2019s got to go in. And, thankfully, it does. He played too well to suffer any more indignity on the last. He signs for a 67, and ends the day at -9. Furyk pars too, and puts his name to a one-over 72, dropping back to -7. \u201cWhen everyone else is under par, that must feel like 80,\u201d comments Colin Montgomerie archly on Sky. Palmer\u2019s round is beginning to slip right at the death. He lets his second, a fairway wood from the first cut down the left, fizz off behind the green down the same side. He\u2019s up a grassy bank, with a swale in between him and the green. Chance of an up and down for birdie, of course, but it\u2019s a test. Once he\u2019s mooched up towards his fate, McIlroy, back on the tee, creams a drive down the middle of the fairway. Day joins him. Day\u2019s second to 17 was a good 40 feet wide left of the pin, but he nevertheless threatens to hole the birdie putt. It doesn\u2019t quite go in. McIlroy gives his 20-footer a chance, too, but par will do as it stays out on the left. -12: Wiesberger (F), McIlroy (17) -11: Fowler (F) -10: Mickelson (F) McIlroy is in no mood to repeat Palmer\u2019s mistake by going long. He clips a safe shot into the heart of the green, quite happy to take his two putts for par and move on. Up on 18, Fowler finds the heart of the green, leaving himself a 40-footer across it for eagle. He hits a magnificent putt, the smoothest of strokes. It\u2019s surely going in, but turns a little to the left at the death, and a birdie will have to suffice. A wry smile. He taps in for a 67, and he\u2019ll finish the third round at -11, one off Wiesberger and McIlroy\u2019s lead. Ilonen has chance to birdie from 12 feet, but hits a very uncertain putt, and signs for a 69. He\u2019s -9, still well placed for this. McIlroy drives into a bunker to the left of 17. Day in the middle of the fairway. Up on the green - or rather through it, down the back - is Ryan Palmer, who hit a hot one in, and can\u2019t get up and down. He chipped up nicely from the rough, over many undulations, to five feet, but pushed the short par saver to the right, and he\u2019s back to -9. Par for Furyk who remains at -7. It\u2019s to and fro all right! Wiesberger, who fannied his second up the fairway, has gathered his thoughts and chipped up the green from 25 yards to six inches! He taps in for a brilliant 65 that\u2019ll go very nicely with his pair of 68s. He\u2019s the new clubhouse leader, and the new co-leader of this tournament! Phil Mickelson takes his two putts, nearly draining his long eagle effort, and settles for a second 67 in a row. That\u2019s another brilliant round by the US veteran! Four birdies in the last five holes! -12: Wiesberger (F), McIlroy (16) -10: Mickelson (F), Fowler (17), Palmer (16) Mickelson has driven into the rough down the left of 18, but he\u2019s battered his ball onto the front of the green. A long two putt for a final birdie that\u2019ll set him up nicely. Wiesberger doesn\u2019t really connect with his second shot, and leaves it short of the green, but still on the short stuff. Back on 16, McIlroy taps in for his birdie, but Day can\u2019t get up and down from distance. He\u2019s back to -9. This is an astonishing to-and-fro tournament! -12: McIlroy (16) -11: Wiesberger (17) Day lashes out onto the fairway, having decided there would be no point going for the green. McIlroy, a good 90 yards further up the hole, and in the fairway to boot, lands his approach down 18 inches to the left of the cup, no bounce, no roll, stone dead, with the breezy confidence a man slapping a \u00a350 note down onto the par and ordering himself a quadruple Scottish wine. That\u2019s a certain birdie, and one which will give him the sole lead of this tournament. Mind you, Wiesberger\u2019s currently playing 18, where he\u2019s found the middle of the fairway and will be dreaming of eagle. The co-leader McIlroy on 16 batters a 350-yard drive down the middle. Day sprays his ball deep into the trees down the left, but the ball\u2019s bounced out into the first cut. He\u2019ll be left with a long shot in, though. Fowler and Ilonen send their irons to the back right of 17. Ilonen has just toppled off the back, but Fowler stays up with a little help from the fringe. Palmer is pin high in two at 16, but he doesn\u2019t hit the very makeable 12-foot putt he has to join the leaders, the ball dying on the left. He\u2019ll have to make do with a par that keeps him at -10. His playing partner Jim Furyk though bogeys, his second on the bounce after a dropped shot at 15. The 2003 US Open winner\u2019s back to -7 now, and of the top 41 players on the leaderboard, he\u2019s the only one over par for his round. ... on 15, McIlroy rattles his birdie putt into the middle of the cup! He punches the air in determination rather than celebration. This is unbelievable! Day can\u2019t make his birdie putt. And up on 17, Mickelson can\u2019t roll in a 25-footer across the green for his birdie. He\u2019s been thoroughly upstaged by Wiesberger there, despite playing one of the approaches of the day at 16 then a pin-high second to the 17th! You can\u2019t do anything about that. -11: Wiesberger (17), McIlroy (15) -10: Fowler (16), Palmer (15), Day (15) Day and McIlroy both find the middle of the green at 15. They\u2019ll both have uphill putts from 15 feet for birdie, though Day\u2019s achievement, from the sand, is the one worthy of a hat-tip. Up on 18, DeLaet sees his birdie putt shave the hole on the left from 15 feet. He\u2019ll have to make do with a second 68 in a row. He\u2019s -8. Fowler can\u2019t make his birdie chance on 16. He\u2019ll stay at -10. But we\u2019re going to have a new leader, because Bernd Wiesberger has just hit the shot of the day, an approach to 17 which pitches 18 inches in front of the hole, then stops one dimple\u2019s width from the edge. He\u2019ll tap in to move to -11. This is sheer brilliance! His approaches at 16 and 17 have been simply out of this world! But there\u2019s no point me putting up a new leader board that shows him as sole leader, because ... Day drives into a bunker down the right of 15, while McIlroy splits the fairway. Up on the green, Palmer fails to hit a left-to-right breaker from 20 feet that\u2019d have given him birdie and sole leadership of the tournament. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve not mentioned the bearded Canadian swashbuckler Graham DeLaet. That was because he started with two bogeys and a double bogey in the first seven holes. But he\u2019s since birdied 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and now 16, and he\u2019s -8 for the tournament! And up on 18, a birdie for Stenson, who finishes with a fine 67. He\u2019s -9. \u201cCan golf get any better than this?\u201d asks Butch Harmon on Sky, as Fowler sends his second to 16 to within ten feet. This is amazing. Astonishing. Just daft! After that mid-round wobble, Day is on his game again, pearling a lovely 5-iron into the middle of the par-three 14th green. Rory\u2019s tee shot ends up in a bunker on the left. Rory splashes out to four feet, and saves par. Day can\u2019t make his birdie putt from 15 feet. But never mind all that! Mickelson has just stuck his second at 16 to three feet, while his playing partner Wiesberger\u2019s approach is a mere 18 inches from the hole! Mickelson moves to -9, while the Austrian joins the leaders at -10! And a birdie to finish for Lee Westwood, splashing to a couple of feet from the bunker on 18. He signs for a 69, not disastrous by any means. He\u2019s not out of this! \u201cOne of these days, Lee Westwood is going to tear up a course during the final round of a major, like Greg Norman did at Troon in 1989 (ok, Norman ultimately didn\u2019t win, I know),\u201d opines Steve Pye. \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be tomorrow? You did tell me to pour myself a turps.\u201d Chop out a few lines of Polyfilla too, because this is turning into one hell of a Saturday night! Just look at this leader board! -10: Wiesberger (16), Fowler (15), Palmer (14), McIlroy (13), Day (13) -9: Oosthuizen (F), Mickelson (16), Ilonen (15), Furyk (14) Nope, it\u2019s not quite happening for Rory today. His wedge was sent to ten feet, and it\u2019s a straightforward uphill birdie putt, but it lips out on the left. He taps in for par, and looks slightly miffed, though he\u2019s clearly trying not to give his opponent any succour. Day slips his birdie effort into the hole, though, and now he\u2019s part of a four-way tie for the lead at -10. Stenson meanwhile has just rattled in an uphill 20-footer at 17 for birdie. He\u2019s -8 again. Good luck in predicting the winner of this tournament! Birdie chance for Fowler on 14. He goes for broke, racing the ball six feet past the hole. But he regroups and knocks in the saver. He stays at -10, still a co-leader. Ilonen is a turn of the ball away from birdie at 14, but remains at -9. Up on 15, Mickelson is in thick rough to the left. There\u2019s water down the right, near the pin, but he cares not, and arrows a iron straight at the flag. It drops four feet shy and that\u2019ll be a great chance for birdie. And it\u2019s in! As the cheers ring around Valhalla, he\u2019s -8 again! This is a crazy afternoon of scoring. McIlroy having one of the quieter days. But he\u2019s just sent his second close at 13, and will be looking to reassert himself over the rest of the field here. Day has given himself a decent look at birdie too. Mickelson revives his challenge with a birdie putt up the 14th green! He\u2019s back to -7. Day nearly chips his third into the cup, and saves his par. But Rory, for the second time today, fluffs a chip. He doesn\u2019t even get his ball on the green, and though he gathers himself together to get up and down with a lovely delicate wedge to a couple of inches, that\u2019s a bogey. Up on 13, Palmer has a putt to swap places with Rory and take the lead, but his 20-footer stays out. What a leader board we\u2019ve got, though! This is astonishing. I\u2019m already calling a play-off tomorrow. -10: Fowler (13), Palmer (13), McIlroy (12) -9: Oosthuizen (F), Wiesberger (14), Ilonen (13), Furyk (13), Day (12) -8: Donaldson (F) Day\u2019s tee shot at 12 into the rough down the left, his second a flyer into the thick stuff to the right of the green. Rory\u2019s in the same spot too from the tee, and he squirts his second through the back of the green. Neither of these lads are on top of their games at all. On 13, Fowler finds the middle of the green but can\u2019t rake home the 40-footer he\u2019s left himself. Par. He\u2019s still -10. And up on 18, a birdie for Louis Oosthuizen, who has quietly moved into very real contention: a bogey at 4 followed by birdies at 7, 9, 14, 17 and now the last hole. He\u2019s signing for a second 67 in two days. He\u2019s right in this now, the new clubhouse leader at -9. It couldn\u2019t last, Matt Dony (5.45pm). It was never meant to last. Do you have any South African grandparents? A couple of dropped shots to report. Lee Westwood slips back on 16, leaving himself a 12-footer from the front edge of the green he can\u2019t make. He\u2019s -6. Henrik Stenson bogeys 15, meanwhile, but will be paradoxically happy enough given he had to rake one in from 35 feet to achieve even that. He\u2019s back to -7. \u201cI\u2019ve gone for a drink in my old local,\u201d begins Matt Dony, \u201cwhere I\u2019m being \u2018entertained\u2019 by the least charismatic acoustic duo ever. (Sample dialogue: \u2018Any David Gray fans in?\u2019) But, boyo Jamie Donaldson is the clubhouse leader in the PGA Championship! Even if it goes no further than that, it\u2019s more success than Welsh golf has had in a good while. Go on, Jamie.\u201d The greatest moment since Ian Woosnam downed a pint of celebratory Guinness on the clubhouse roof of the K Club and let most of it squirt out of his nose captained Europe to the 2006 Ryder Cup? Oh this is astonishingly good from McIlroy, who flicks his ball into the air, over the bank, and lands it three feet from the pin. That was floating through the air like a cotton-wool ball there. McIlroy, his putter as Q-Tip, pops the par putt home. He\u2019s still the sole leader. Rickie Fowler is, famously by now I think, top of the cumulative leader board in the majors this season. He\u2019s -28 right now. McIlroy, by comparison, is only -22. But of course he\u2019s actually won one of the things. Fowler tries to widen this particular gap, and narrow the one at the top of the PGA leaderboard, with a 20-foot birdie attempt on 12, but the ball stays high on the right. He remains at -10. Mind you, he could have a share of the lead soon, given the bother McIlroy\u2019s in. Meanwhile Ilonen\u2019s in a spot of trouble in the rough down the left of 12, short of the green in two, but he flicks a delicate wedge to three feet and scrambles his par. The prophecy of Steve Pye (5.31pm) has yet to be proven. McIlroy pulls a dreadful tee shot at 11 down the bank to the left. Even Phil Mickelson couldn\u2019t get up and down from there. A steep bank, thick grass, and he\u2019s shortsided. \u201cIlonen is flying at the moment, but I\u2019m not sure he can Finnish the job,\u201d writes Steve Pye. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry about that. I haven\u2019t even had a drink.\u201d Pour yourself a turps, it\u2019s Saturday night. I\u2019d be gaddered right now if I wasn\u2019t doing this. Rory rattles in his par effort, the ball looing the loop before dropping. He\u2019s -11 again, the sole leader! Day whips a chip out of the thick rough to six feet, and can go to school on Rory\u2019s putt, but leaves it out on the right. He stays at -9, and it\u2019s just not happening for him today. Mickelson sheds another shot, this time at 12, pushing a short putt well wide left of the hole. He\u2019s back to -6. But his playing partner Bernd Wiesberger raps in a six-foot birdie chance to move to -9. That will hurt Lefty, and the gallery. But the biggest roar for a while comes at 11, where Ryan Palmer, having sent his tee shot onto the fringe back left of the par three, races in a right-to-left slider from 30 feet! He\u2019s in a share of second, and the unsung American is simply not of a mind to go away! -11: McIlroy (10) -10: Fowler (11), Palmer (11) -9: Wiesberger (12), Ilonen (11), Furyk (10), Day (10) -8: Donaldson (F), Stenson (14) Jim Furyk gets his round going again with a birdie down the par-five 10th. He\u2019s back to -9. The green cleared, Day can take a shy at it with his fairway wood. He only succeeds in plonking his ball into the thick rough front right of the green. Rory, who winged one out of bounds on the opening day, opts to lay up. He wedges in to leave an uphill putt from 12 feet for birdie. Par meanwhile for Fowler at 11, who chips from the fringe to a couple of inches and taps home. Mickelson down the bank at the side of 11. He chips up to 12 feet, but can\u2019t nail the par putt. A loss of momentum here: having gone out in 33, he struggled down 10, and now this. A fine birdie opportunity for Day at 9. It looks as though the downhill tickler is going into the cup, but it glides to the right at the death, staying up. He stays at -9. He won\u2019t be particularly pleased to see McIlroy scramble brilliantly from the hill at the back of the green to save par. Meanwhile Jamie Donaldson, who had birdied 16, comes up 18. He\u2019s in the rough to the left of the fairway, but can still reach the green. And how, bumping his ball past the flag, eight feet away. A great eagle chance, but his putt squirts to the left. A slight disappointment, but he\u2019s finished with a marvellous 66, and is the new clubhouse leader at -8! -10: Fowler (10), McIlroy (9) -9: Ilonen (10), Palmer (9), Day (9) -8: Donaldson (F), Stenson (13), Wiesberger (11), Furyk (9) -7: Mahan (F), Scott (F), Chappell (F), Oosthuizen (15), Westwood (14), Mickelson (11) Rory\u2019s not quite hitting his straps today. He nearly drives into a bunker to the right of 9, then from the first cut sends a flyer through the back of the green into deep trouble. Day is in a similar position, and clips his second pin high, leaving a 15-foot chance for birdie. With Rory facing a very tricky up and down from up on a knoll, there\u2019s a possibility of a two-shot swing here. But never mind that quite yet, because up on the 10th green, Fowler sends his third over the flag to 12 feet, then curls in a right-to-left breaker for birdie. He\u2019s got a share of McIlroy\u2019s lead now at -10! His playing partner Ilonen, by the way, wedged to a couple of feet, and tapped in for his birdie. He\u2019s one off the lead at -9! And this is really cooking right now, because Westwood birdies 14 after sending his tee shot to five feet. He\u2019s -7. -10: Fowler (10), McIlroy (8) -9: Ilonen (10), Palmer (9), Day (8) Mickelson faffs around in the rough all down the right of 10, but knocks in a 12-footer to save his par. The crowd celebrate as though it were a birdie, and he remains at -8. Westwood sails his approach at 13 into the heart of the green. He\u2019s got a ten footer for birdie, but lets it slide past. He stays at -6. And there\u2019s more as-you-were news: Palmer fluffs a chip to the right of 9, but sinks the 15-footer he\u2019s left himself. He stays at -9 too. Lee Westwood\u2019s rollercoaster round continues. He rolls in a 15-footer for birdie at 12, to rise to -6 again. Consistency has been a pipe dream for Westwood today. Can he finally get it together? On 8, McIlroy\u2019s ball snags in the thick stuff to the front of the green, though he\u2019s only 15 feet or so from the pin. Day is in the heart of the green, faced with a medium-length test for birdie. Rory first, and he duffs his chip! He gave up on that shot halfway through. He\u2019s left with a ten-footer to save his par. Day next: he leaves his birdie putt short, and taps in for par. That\u2019s disappointing, in the context of the match-play-style pressure he could have put on McIlroy had he made birdie. But the gap between the pair narrows nonetheless, as Rory doesn\u2019t really hit the putt either, and hangs his head in a mixture of misery and shame as he taps in for bogey. -10: McIlroy (8) -9: Fowler (9), Palmer (8), Day (8) Day leaves his birdie putt out on the right. He\u2019s just not quite clicking today. Rory meanwhile rattles his into the cup. He\u2019s suddenly got a little bit of breathing space, because Palmer can\u2019t make his medium-length birdie putt on 8, remaining at -9, while Furyk three putts, missing a tiddler for par and dropping back to -8. That\u2019s appalling, really, there\u2019s no excuse for that. -11: McIlroy (7) -9: Fowler (8), Palmer (8), Day (7) -8: Stenson (11), Mickelson (9), Wiesberger (9), Furyk (8) Mickelson for birdie at 9. He\u2019s got a downhill putt with left to right break from 20 feet. He gives it too much out left, and will stay at -8. He\u2019s joined on that mark by his playing partner Bernd Wiesberger, who clipped his approach to 18 inches and tapped in for par. Brilliant. Stenson can\u2019t make his birdie putt on 11 and looks thoroughly hacked off at spurning such a good opportunity; so much for the serenity I was talking about. Back on 7, Rory clips a chip to five feet. He\u2019ll have that for birdie. Day splashes out to seven feet to set up his birdie chance. Day and McIlroy both hit poor approaches towards the 7th. Day finds the bunker to the right of the green, and Rory is even wider than that. He\u2019s on short grass, though, so has something to work with. Up on 11, Stenson fires his tee shot right at the flag. He\u2019ll have an uphill 12-footer for another birdie. Of all the players out on the course - with the possible exception of Ryan Palmer, who has just sent his tee shot at 8 pin high, 20 feet from the flag - he\u2019s looking the calmest right now. Henrik Stenson was out in 33 strokes, and he\u2019s just rolled in a 12-footer at 10 for another birdie. He\u2019s -8. Back on the 8th, Rickie Fowler has stroked a tee shot to eight feet, but he doesn\u2019t make the birdie putt. On 7, par for Furyk, but a birdie for Palmer, who got up and down from thick rough at the back of the green with a lovely swish of the wedge. And on 11, Lee Westwood has just prodded at a 12-foot par putt in a very uncertain fashion, and he\u2019s dropped another shot. That was dismal. He\u2019s slipping out of this after a very lively start. The drive at the 4th hole feels an awful long time away right now. So much for Lee Westwood getting his round going again with that birdie at 9. He\u2019s dropped a shot at 10, after faffing around in an awful lot of rough all the way down the right of the hole, and required a 25-foot bogey putt to avoid another double-bogey disaster. He\u2019s back to -6. One of the first-round leaders, Kevin Chappell, is coming back into the picture again. He\u2019s birdied 1, 4, 11 and now 15, and is suddenly -7 for the tournament again. A stroke of luck for Fowler on 7. He mishits his second, a long fairway wood, but clears the water and is happy enough to see his ball go in the big bunker to the right of the green. A long bunker shot if he wants to make birdie, but par wouldn\u2019t be so bad when you consider the alternatives. He splashes out to eight feet, so birdie chance it is. And he puts it away. He\u2019s -9! Back on 6, Day\u2019s wedge into the green is straight at the flag, but doesn\u2019t really release towards the cup. He\u2019s short by 15 feet, and bogey looks more likely than not. Sure enough, it stays out on the left, and he\u2019s back to -9. Rory meanwhile is one turn of the ball away from a sudden two-shot lead, but his 20-footer across the green is short of exactly one joule of energy. He\u2019ll have to settle for par, but he\u2019s the sole leader again. Meanwhile up on 18, a birdie for Adam Scott, and he signs for a superlative 66. He\u2019s -7, and right back in the mix for the 2014 PGA Championship. -10: McIroy (6) -9: Fowler (7), Furyk (6), Day (6) -8: Mickelson (7), Palmer (6) Furyk throws a chip into the air from the deep depression down the right of 6, and lands his ball a couple of feet from the hole. A lovely imaginative shot, and one that\u2019ll save his par. Back on the tee, Day sprays his tee shot at 6, an iron, into the punters down the left. Trouble there. He\u2019s down a hill, hitting blind. He gets the ball back up onto the fairway, but he\u2019s left with a long-distance up and down. Rory meanwhile splits the fairway, then creams a long iron pin high. He\u2019ll be left with a 20-footer for birdie. Up on 7, Mickelson rasps a second into the heart of the green at the par five. He can\u2019t drain the uphill 25-foot eagle putt, but taps in for a birdie and scampers off with his tongue lolling out, like the eager puppy he always resembles. -10: McIlroy (5), Day (5) -9: Furyk (6) -8: Mickelson (7), Fowler (6), Palmer (6) Lee Westwood gets his round going again by stroking a wedge pin high to ten feet on 9, and slipping the birdie effort straight into the cup. He\u2019s back to -7. Day, from the rough to the left of 5, smacks a gorgeous iron to six feet. That\u2019s outstanding. Rory is in the middle of the fairway with wedge in hand, and really needs to do something. And that\u2019s what he does, sending one over the flag and biting ten feet from the pin, then curling in a gentle right-to-left slider for birdie. Day follows him in. The pair are co-leading this tournament, a shot ahead of Jim Furyk, who is in a little trouble at 6, down a swale to the right of the green, facing a difficult up and down. A three-putt for Westwood on the par-three 8th. That\u2019s a very poor bogey, especially in the wake of his distinctly average performance down 7. Currently on 7: Henrik Stenson, who has his heart in his mouth as he goes for the flag in two, toys with the water in front of the green, and leaves his ball in thick rough to the left of the green. He lifts a delicate chip to a couple of feet, and that\u2019s a birdie that\u2019ll cancel out a shot he dropped at 5. McIlroy plops a ball down in the drop zone. He\u2019s hitting three into a green plenty of his peers have left with an eagle on their card. Day can\u2019t make his eagle, hitting a very tentative putt, but birdie will do. He\u2019s got a share of the lead with Furyk - and McIlroy, who rattles a 12-foot saver right into the cup, and walks off the green punching the air as though he\u2019s made par. A brilliant save. And birdie at 5 for Ryan Palmer, who shows Rory what can be done after averting disaster on 4. -9: Furyk (5), McIlroy (4), Day (4) -8: Fowler (5), Palmer (5) Furyk could be the sole leader of this tournament soon. Because on 4, McIlroy lets his driver turn over on impact, sending an awful shot arrowing into Palmer Country. But it doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s going to be as fortunate. That may have found the water. Day twists the knife by arrowing his drive straight at the flag, and he\u2019ll have a ten footer for eagle! Which would leapfrog Furyk, so scrub that stuff about the US veteran being sole leader, but don\u2019t let me confuse myself, it\u2019s not happened yet. Anyway, this is how they currently stand: -9: Furyk (4), McIlroy (3) -8: Fowler (5), Day (3) -7: Mahan (F), Stenson (7), Mickelson (5), Wiesberger (5), Ilonen (5), Palmer (4) Ryan Palmer nearly finds water down the left of 4 with a wild, wild tee shot. But the ball clatters off some overhanging branches and drops near a cartpath running in front of it. He punches a chip onto the green, and saves an unlikely par with two putts. Back on 3, McIlroy and Day both have a look at birdies, but they\u2019re not going in. Fowler watches a decent birdie effort from 20 feet slide by the right on 5. That would have taken him into a share of the lead with McIlroy - and Jim Furyk, who drives into a greenside bunker on 4, then splashes out to a couple of feet and taps home for birdie. He\u2019s -9, and co-leader of this tournament! An eventful start to the round for Mikko Ilonen. He double bogeyed 2, but he\u2019s just birdied 3 and 4, a brilliant response! He\u2019s still -7. Mickelson is in a little trouble down a swale to the left of 5, but he gets up and down for par. In fact, he nearly holed a brilliant chip, bumped up the hill! He\u2019s still -7. Up on 7, Westwood plays it safe with his second, leaving the ball to the right of the green and avoiding the water. But then he duffs his chip, and will be left with a long birdie putt. Not good. And he\u2019s not getting that 30-footer. Par. And on 18, Danny Willetts races a birdie putt six feet past, but knocks in the par putt, and signs for a wonderful 66. Par of the week! Day\u2019s third on 2 is fantastic, a wedge flipped on to the front of the green from the rough down the right. The ball releases, and he\u2019ll have an uphill 15-footer to save an outrageous on-safari par! And it\u2019s in! That is utterly preposterous. He was knee deep in the jungle down the left, with his shoes and socks off! He wanders off with a massive smile on his face. That is sheer brilliance, Day a swashbuckling hero. Rory, from the centre of the green, makes a workaday par. It\u2019s not often he\u2019s upstaged, but Day\u2019s managed it there! Another birdie for Jamie Donaldson, who rolls in a 20-footer on 10. He\u2019s now at -6. On the give-me-a-birdie-and-possibly-an-eagle 4th, Mickelson misses the green on the right and has sand in between his ball and hole. No problem! He flips up to three feet, and pops in the birdie effort! He\u2019s -7, as is his playing partner Wiesberger, who picks up a shot in a more conventional, fuss-free fashion. Farcical scenes as Day looks for his ball in what is technically a hazard. Or rather, he stands on the fairway side of the creek looking confused as his caddy takes his shoes and socks off, Jean van de Velde style, to cross the water. On the other side - assisted by David Feherty, former pro and broadcaster - the caddy finds the ball. Day takes his shoes and socks off, and makes the crossing himself. He\u2019s helped up by Feherty, though for a second looks like pulling him back in. Day takes a look at the ball, and decides to play out of the hazard. His caddy, now back on the other side, flings a club across. He catches it. And he\u2019s going to play it barefoot! He thins it back across the fairway, into rough on the right. He\u2019ll have trouble escaping with bogey, never mind par, but this could have been a lot worse once he opted to play out of the hazard. Rory, incidentally, has found the centre of the green in two, and has very dry feet. McIlroy straight down the middle of 2. But Day has hit his ball so far left it\u2019s avoided the water hazard running down that side of the hole. However it\u2019s sunk into a peaty marsh. He\u2019ll do well to find that, with no stewards around, never mind play it. A shaky start off the tees for Day. Westwood scrambles brilliantly from the front left of 6, chipping to a couple of feet and tapping home for his par. Pars for Day and McIlroy at the opening hole, neither quite hitting their first putts with any conviction. At the par-three 3rd, Fowler nearly slamdunks a 7-iron into the cup. He\u2019ll have a five footer coming back for birdie. And it\u2019s in! He\u2019s -8. Wonderful birdie. On 18, Mahan flops to two feet from thick stuff at the back, and taps in for a joint-best-of-week 65. He\u2019s -7, and well placed for tomorrow. -9: McIlroy (1) -8: Fowler (3), Day (1) -7: Mahan (F), Westwood (5), Stenson (4), Palmer (1) -6: Snedeker (F), Willett (16), Mickelson (3), Wiesberger (3), Ilonen (3) Brandt Snedeker finishes with a birdie and signs for a 66. He\u2019s -6, leading in the clubhouse. Furyk can only find the front left of the 1st green, but manages to scramble his par. He stays at -8. Stenson birdies 4 after hitting his second to six feet, and moves to -7. One of Europe\u2019s nearly men looks very much in the mood. Back on the 1st, Day finds the middle of the green having been fairly fortunate to find his ball near to the fairway having hit branches, albeit still in the thick stuff. Rory goes right at the flag, toying with the bunker front right. He\u2019ll have an uphill 15-footer for birdie. Meanwhile on 16, more superlative play from Danny Willett, who is in thick rough down the left, but powers out to the back of the green, skipping over a bunker at the front with a fortunate bounce, on the long par four. He then curves a huge semi-circular putt back down the green, right to left, his ball horseshoeing out. Par, but a very scenic one. The crowd are loving him today, gasping as the ball refuses to drop. He\u2019s still -6. The leaders are out! \u201cOn the tee, from Ireland, the 2012 PGA champion Rory McIlroy!\u201d Haw. That\u2019ll irritate quite a few internet bores. But never mind them. Ball crashed down the middle. Then Jason Day flays an appalling opening drive into the trees down the left. Good luck with that. Mickelson plays the 2nd as solidly as he played the opening hole. No drama, but no birdie either. He\u2019ll be happy enough to get through one of the hardest holes on the course without running into trouble. Up on 5, Westwood shaves the left-hand side of the cup with a birdie attempt from 25 feet. He stays at -7. And on 9, Jamie Donaldson of Southern Wales sends a 50-foot left-to-right curler into the cup for a brilliant birdie! He\u2019s -5. Westwood pops his eagle putt into the cup! To be honest, he\u2019d have wanted escorting off the course, then battering with sticks and dumping behind the bins, if he\u2019d done anything else. Such a wonderful drive. He\u2019s now two off the lead! Exactly the start he needed, after the dismal back nine he suffered yesterday. Jim Furyk batters his opening drive into the rough down the right of 1. Not the ideal start for a usually steady player. Ryan Palmer, who has one top-ten finish in the Masters on his CV but little else, splits the fairway. Up on the green, Fowler shows soft hands to guide his chip to a couple of inches, saving his par and nearly making an unlikely birdie. -9: McIlroy -8: Day, Furyk -7: Westwood (4), Fowler (1), Ilonen (1), Palmer -6: Mahan (16), Willett (15), Stenson (3), Mickelson (1), Wiesberger (1) Rickie Fowler is out, but his wedge from the centre of the 1st fairway is an abysmal nonsense. He plonks it into the thick rough to the right-hand side of the green, and he doesn\u2019t have much space to work with, the flag tucked in on that side. Danny Willett refuses to let the wheels clank off. Double bogey avoided at 14, and he\u2019s now stuck his second at 15 over the flag from thick rough down the left of the fairway. He\u2019ll have a good look at birdie from 12 feet. But he doesn\u2019t read the left-to-right break and the putt\u2019s never dropping. Never mind, another par. Meanwhile Lee Westwood has just smoked his drive straight at the flag at the short par-four 4th, and will have a two-footer for eagle! From the swale to the left of the 18th green, Sergio chips to 12 inches. Beautiful touch. He shakes hands on a 66, and he\u2019s -5 for the tournament. He\u2019ll only be in contention tomorrow if all the leaders fail to take advantage of these conditions, which let\u2019s face it is unlikely, though the charlatans doing the weather forecasts have flipped one way and then flopped the other today, so you never know. At the moment, it\u2019s set fair, so bad luck Sergio. Gah. On 14, Willett fluffs a chip and charges a long par putt ten feet past the hole. He does well to slot home the bogey putt. He\u2019s back to -6. On 3, Westwood\u2019s long birdie effort shaves the left-hand side of the hole. He stays at -5. And back on 1, Mickelson is pin high with his second shot, but the 15-foot birdie effort always misses on the right. Par, and he stays at -6. A perfect start for Henrik Stenson, with birdie at the opening hole after a pin-high approach. Coming up behind: Phil Mickelson, who tees off after the sort of reception not heard at Valhalla since the 2008 Ryder Cup. He splits the fairway. And if there\u2019s any man out there who has the tools and mindset to launch a birdie charge, it\u2019s Phil Mickelson. This could be some round of golf, one way or another. Here\u2019s Hubert O\u2019Hearn: \u201cI was thinking about something, vis a vis Rory\u2019s purple patch since breaking off his engagement. It seems that Life\u2019s Major Events either propel a golfer onwards or utterly destroy them. Hogan won most of his majors after his body-breaking auto accident. Arnold Palmer never won another major after giving up smoking, nor has Tiger since giving up [careful now! - Father Ted Ed.] um, stroking. Whether it is a regained focus on the game, or a depressing sense of loss, the major life events either propel one forwards, or leave one in a Sartre-esque funk. Except of course Jack Nicklaus. because Jack Nicklaus was not a human, he was a Cyberman in a blonde wig and clothes picked out by Barbara Nicklaus.\u201d The Golden Bear always argued that Woods might never reach his 18-major mark, arguing that life was always likely to get in the way. This was years before Tiger\u2019s tumult. And it looks like he was right. But if Tiger\u2019s not going to get to 18, one more, valedictory major would make for a deliciously bittersweet (and I reckon more romantic) story. Preferably at the age of 49, making him the oldest major winner ever. At the Masters, naturally. Providing it\u2019s not at the expense of Sergio. Danny Willett\u2019s wedge into 13 was incredibly ordinary. He\u2019s left with a 40-footer for birdie. No matter! He rakes it in, and he\u2019s -7 for the tournament! This is a stunning round! And up on 15, Hunter Mahan flipped a wedge straight at the flag, and tapped in for his third birdie in four holes! He\u2019s -6. This is hotting up! Though how many majors would Adam Scott have if he didn\u2019t suffer from severe putting issues? He\u2019s just missed a dead straight six-footer on 10 for birdie, and remains at -5. Sergio is trying his best to bugger up his round, having dropped a shot at 16 and now left himself on the apron at the back of 17 with a 12-footer remaining for par. But he\u2019s whacked in the putt and punches the air in delight. He\u2019s not going to win this tournament, but unlike the Sergio of a couple of years ago, he isn\u2019t going to give up and mope. He stays at -4. Good old Sergio. Next year, maybe. Golfing gods? How about it? Huh? Here we go, then, folks. A classic afternoon of low scoring? All the signs, like the 8-ball on the back of David Puddy\u2019s jacket, point to yes! Brandt Snedeker has birdied 7, 8, 10, 11, 14 and now 15 to move to -5. Charl Schwartzel has birdied 4, 6, 9 and 10: he\u2019s -6. Hunter Mahan and Ryan Moore are both four under for their rounds, through 14 and 13 respectively, at -5. And Danny Willett keeps on keepin\u2019 on: he\u2019s scrambled brilliant par saves at 11 and 12 to remain at -6, five under today. Lee Westwood, meanwhile, is a dimple\u2019s width away from draining a 25-footer for birdie on 1. A solid start, though on a day like this, solid ain\u2019t gonna be good enough. Scott is back in the hotseat to guide you through the rest of the night. Farewell! Rory McIlroy is currently on the driving range, receiving some loud cheers from the galleries, leading to Paul McGinley comparing him to a rock star. McGinley then says the word banter twice in the same sentence. Down with that sort of thing! Meanwhile, back on the course, Sergio Garc\u00eda has dropped a shot on 16, leaving his par putt from around 12ft short. Another birdie on the 4th \u2013 this time from Billy Horschel, who also picked up a shot on the first and third holes, to move to -4. At this rate, par will see you losing a shot on most of the field. Sky are currently showing a highlights package of Phil Mickelson\u2019s round yesterday, which included an eagle on the 18th. Mickelson says it will be difficult to chase down McIlroy but says he has a low-scoring round in him with his putting \u201cfeeling really good\u201d. He tees off half an hour from now, sitting nicely on -6, and is currently out on the practice range with Butch Harmon, who, at 71, says he has been rejuvenated by adding Rickie Fowler to his roll of players. He has altered Fowler\u2019s swing slightly and it has paid off so far, with the 25-year-old on -7. He gets underway 50 minutes from now. McIlroy is in insatiable form, but where do we reckon the challenge is going to come from? Jason Day\u2019s game is in good nick, while an evergreen Jim Furyk has been rolling back the years. The fourth is proving profitable today, with an average of 3.28 shots on the par four and six eagles so far. Jamie Donaldson eyes up a putt to make that seven but he drags it a foot to the left of the hole to leave a tap-in for birdie. Sergio Garc\u00eda is beginning to make a move up the leaderboard after a birdie on 14 takes him to -5, his third on the back nine so far. No such luck for Chris Wood on the 2nd, whose attempt to move to -4 misses, and Adam Scott, whose effort on the 7th is too firm and shoots a foot past the hole. Evening everybody. We\u2019re still 90 minutes away from the leading pairing of Rory McIlroy and Jason Day teeing-off but Vijay Singh, on -3, has got his round underway by dissecting the first fairway but his putting has been mildly questionable so far this week. Meanwhile, the rain has stopped and Paul McGinley, on Sky, informs us that the conditions are now glorious, conducive to plenty of low scores. Oh Brooks! Koepka is behind the 18th in thick rough, and he looks to flop one up onto the green. But he doesn\u2019t commit, letting his club waft under the ball, and he\u2019s still in the oomska. Another hoick and he\u2019s on the green, but left with a 15-footer for par. He can\u2019t slot that away, indeed he fires it six feet past the hole. But he knocks in the return for a disappointing bogey on a hole he\u2019d have been hoping to birdie. Nevertheless, that\u2019s a 66, and he\u2019s -5 overall, in good nick for the final day. \u201cI seem to recall Butch Harmon talking about his fear of snakes, or was it crocodiles, after the Kiawah fight (11.55am),\u201d recalls Simon McMahon. \u201cThe reason? \u2018I don\u2019t trust anything that doesn\u2019t have shoulders\u2019. Can\u2019t argue with that, I suppose.\u201d I suppose not, although the Hamburger Helper doesn\u2019t have shoulders either, being nothing more than a talking golf glove who shills filthy but extremely delicious meat-bolstering tat. And I trust him. While I\u2019m off having a quick bowl of that, Alan Smith will be your host. See you soon! Jonas Blixt has just landed his tee shot at 8 roughly 12 inches from the flag. So nearly an ace, but that\u2019s a birdie that\u2019ll take him to -3. Birdie for Justin Rose at the last, and he ends with a 67, at -4 for the tournament. Could have been so much better, but then that\u2019s the whole point of golf. On that point: there\u2019s only one way to respond to a run of five straight birdies, as Thorbjorn Olesen recently made. And that\u2019s by dropping a shot. He bogeys 12, to slip back to -4. The first serious inroads toward the top of the leaderboard. Brooks Koepka stuck his approach at 17 to four feet, and was never going to miss a straight uphill putt. It\u2019s his ninth birdie today, having made three bogeys and only five pars! He\u2019s -6 for the tournament. Marc Warren meanwhile makes birdie up the last, and signs his name on a card which also features the number 66. He\u2019s made a very positive move up through the field. -9: McIlroy -8: Day, Furyk -7: Palmer, Fowler, Ilonen -6: Koepka (17), Mickelson, Wiesberger -5: Warren (F), Willett (7), Scott (5), DeLaet, Stricker, Stenson, Luiten, Dubuisson, Westwood, Oosthuizen Sergio on the surge!!! He makes birdie at 10, and has just followed that up with a huge rake up the par-three 11th, having left his tee shot well short of the pin. Suddenly he\u2019s -4 for his round and the tournament. He\u2019s blemish-free so far, and yes I\u2019m already aware I should never have mentioned that. Marc Warren rattles in a 30-footer on 17 for another birdie. He\u2019s finishing very strongly; he\u2019s -4. Meanwhile starting extremely strongly is Adam Scott, who has just clipped his second at 5 to six feet, and slotted away another birdie putt. He\u2019s already picked up three shots through the first five holes, and is -5 for the tournament. This is brilliant stuff. Someone\u2019s going to post a total that will make the leaders at least think. The first man back in the clubhouse today was Graeme McDowell. The 2010 US Open champion shot a respectable level-par 71, remaining at +1 overall, though you\u2019ll never see a stranger card: birdies at 4, 8, 15 and 18, and a quadruple-bogey eight at the short par-four 13th, where he found water twice with his approaches. \u201cAll from 101 yards from hole after driving,\u201d sighs Kevin Mannerings. \u201cDid that crocodile (11.55am) get involved?\u201d Thorbjorn Olesen has just raked in a 35-footer on 11 for birdie ... and that\u2019s his fifth in a row! He\u2019s suddenly -5 for this tournament and bouncing right now as opposed to walking. Another birdie for Adam Scott, this time at 4, despite being one of the few players to fail to reach the green with his tee shot. He gets up and down from the thick stuff at the front to move to -4. Birdie for Ernie Els at 2; he\u2019s -3. Danny Willett has been turning it on too. He\u2019s short and right of the 6th, but nearly bumps and runs a chip into the cup from 60 feet. One more turn and that\u2019d have been his fifth shot picked up in six holes. As it is, he stays at -5. Justin Rose has lost all momentum as a result of that missed tiddler on 15. He tries to nudge one up onto the green at 16 with a fairway wood from a deep depression, and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s in as he fails to give it enough juice. The ball stops 12 feet from the flag, and he misses the par putt. He slips back to -3, all that brilliant work counting for very little right now. Brooks Koepka is turning it on. Birdie at 13, and now he\u2019s rolled in another from 20 feet towards the back of 14. He\u2019s -5 for this tournament now. A lot of black clouds overhead, and a small bespoke stratocumulus might be forming above Kenny Perry\u2019s noggin right now, as he splashes close from a bunker at 6 and should save his par, but misses the short putt to drop back to -3. Marc Warren will be feeling more chipper, having birdied 14 and then set himself up for another with a fine approach to 16 that dropped on the back of a bunker at the front of the green and kicked left towards the flag. He drained the putt and now he\u2019s -3 for both round and tournament. The par-four 4th is effectively a par three today, if they drive straight. Jonas Blixt is the latest to boom a tee shot at the flag. It stops 15 feet short, but he rattles in the eagle putt and moves up to -3. A lot of shots are going to be picked up on this hole today. God knows what Lee Westwood is going to do on it. Either a hole-in-one albatross or a triple bogey, are my guesses. Adam Scott is out, and he\u2019s whipped his second at 2, a long iron on the behemoth par four, to a couple of feet. That\u2019ll take him to -3. On 15, Justin Rose lets a short par putt slide by the hole. He\u2019s back to -4, and he wanders off in high dudgeon. There\u2019s a very low score out here today on this soft course - a chance to match the record major low of 63, or post something even better? - though that might be beyond Rose now. Justin Rose marches on. His second at 13, a gentle wedge, lands 18 inches from the flag but spins back to 12 feet. No matter, he rolls in the birdie putt, and he\u2019s -5 now. It should be -6, because he\u2019s just sent a very makeable 12-footer to the left of the cup at 14 after a fine tee shot. This is turning into something of a statement round. A couple more birdies, and if the weather comes in later - and the officials are apparently now worried about this - Rose could be in with an outside chance tomorrow. Nothing more, but that would be enough from the position he started in. Meanwhile Kenny Perry isn\u2019t content with that eagle. He\u2019s just birdied 5, moving up to -4. Rose, Willett, Perry, Koepka ... the birdies are flying in, and now Thorbjorn Olesen has reached the turn in 32 after a run of birdies between 7 and 9. He\u2019s -3. \u201cYou\u2019ll not see a better drive this week, unless one somehow goes in.\u201d Well, nearly. Nearly. Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano has just pearled his drive at 3 right at the flag, the ball landing on the front of the green and bouncing towards the pin at the back. If it hit the flagstick, it\u2019d have dropped for a hole-in-one albatross. Or an albatross hole-in-one. I\u2019m not sure what should take precedence. The ball rests ten feet behind the cup, and it\u2019s knocked back in for eagle. He\u2019s -2 overall. Astonishing! He moves to -2. Meanwhile his playing partner Danny Willett drove onto a grassy mound to the left of the green - and has chipped in for his eagle, too! He\u2019s -5 overall, because he\u2019s already birdied 2 and 3. This is some run from Rotherham\u2019s finest. The veteran local star Kenny Perry has just obliterated the 4th hole! He\u2019s battered his drive 291 yards. The hole\u2019s playing 292 today. He rolls in the eagle putt, and moves to -3 for the tournament! If there was a roof over Valhalla, it\u2019d be flying somewhere over North Carolina right now. You\u2019ll not see a better drive this week, unless one somehow goes in. Meanwhile Brooks Koepka has been on something of a charge: birdies at 7, 8 and 9, and he\u2019s reached the turn in 32. He\u2019s now -3 overall through 11. Before the action hots up, time to remember that it\u2019s two years to the day since one of the great PGA Championship duels: Croc v Snake at the 2012 tournament at Kiawah Island (2.36pm BST). Warning: this clip\u2019s not for the squeamish. It\u2019s not for those who like competitive action, either, because it\u2019s something of a rout. Astonishingly, the whole thing was shown live and in its entirety on CBS Sports. Nobody could be bothered cutting away from it. Sadly, the most entertaining part of the whole affair is missing from this YouTube version. If memory serves, CBS later cut back to the croc, who was floating serenely, a big toothy grin plastered all over its visage, content, stuffed full of delicious snake. He looked like a golf-club captain filled to the eyeballs with gin. The whole thing was quite a step away from the picture of the natural world painted by the BBC golf doyen Peter Alliss, and his gentle \u201cAh, the crow, I wonder what winter has in store for him this year\u201d schtick. Two years ago today. RIP ol\u2019 snake. No birdie for Rose on 10, as his putt shaves the right of the hole. That\u2019s a poor miss, as that was from five feet, not ten as I suggested in the previous entry. Back on 4, Ian Poulter has driven the green but can\u2019t quite rake in the 50-footer for eagle. Birdie will do; he\u2019s -2 overall. According to Butch Harmon on Sky, the other players have been giving Poulter pelters on the driving range for yesterday\u2019s online diatribe against British Airways. Twitter gets everyone in the end. Stay away from the tweets, kids. Bad social media! Mess you up! Rose is playing magnificently. He\u2019s in thick rough down the left of the par-five 10th, but has lifted a classy wedge over the flag to ten feet. The putt he\u2019s left with isn\u2019t quite a gimme, but if he sinks that his round could get quite interesting. Meanwhile news of the old warrior Colin Montgomerie, who on this long, wet course must feel like a man shoved into the lion\u2019s den with neither whip nor chair. The reigning Senior PGA and US Senior champion is holding his own: two bogeys this morning cancelled out by two birdies, the latest a brilliant two at the par-three 8th, his tee shot sent five feet from the flag. He remains at level par. Doing the old boys even prouder: the runner up at the 1996 PGA here, the local hero Kenny Perry. The Kentuckian has creamed his second at the opening hole to a couple of feet, and rapped in the birdie putt to move to -2. It\u2019s Sergio! He\u2019s out early doors having just sneaked inside the cut with opening rounds of 70 and 72. That first major will continue to elude him here at Valhalla, but he appears to be in the mood to make one of his trademark it\u2019s-too-late-you-daft-bugger birdie charges. A shot picked up at the opening hole, and now he wedges pin high to ten feet at 4 before stroking in a second birdie. He\u2019s -2 for the tournament. Of course, if he goes on to shoot his second 61 in as many weeks, we can talk again. No biggie, then, Sergio. Be about your business! It\u2019s raining today in Valhalla. Both in terms of precipitation - it\u2019s a bit grim right now, though it\u2019s expected to clear up soon enough - and more importantly in terms of birdies. Plenty out there this morning. The big early move has been made by last year\u2019s US Open champion Justin Rose, who has picked up four shots on the front nine, and would have reached the turn in 30 had a chip at 9 dropped rather than shaving the side of the hole. He\u2019s -4 for both his round and the tournament. Hideki Matsuyama meanwhile birdied 1, 3 and 4, and is suddenly -2 for the tournament. Also out there with a couple of birdies to their name already: Graeme McDowell (-1 overall through 11), Marc Warren (-2 overall through 8) and Zach Johnson (-2 overall through 5). If this is anything to go by, which it surely is, we should be in for a treat when the players closer to the business end of the leaderboard come out to play. It\u2019s Moving Day all right. Good morning America. Well, that\u2019s the field cleaved in half. And while the lion\u2019s share of the attention afforded to the cut was concentrated on the travails of Tiger, a word for the 20 club professionals who did battle at Valhalla this week. The PGA Championship doesn\u2019t bother with amateurs - the clue\u2019s in the name, I guess - though one could play if they somehow managed to win either the Masters, the US Open or the Open Championship. Instead, the field\u2019s given a little twist by the addition of the folk who, with infinite patience, spend day in day out teaching clowns like me how to connect clubface with ball. Ryan Helminen of Menasha, Wisconsin is one such chap, and the 39-year old came within one stroke of making it to Saturday and Sunday and mixing it with the big boys at the business end of Glory\u2019s Last Shot. His level par 71 yesterday brought him close. Birdie at the 9th, his last hole, wasn\u2019t quite enough, and he\u2019ll always be thinking about the five-footer for birdie he missed on 7 as he chased the two shots he needed to make it. \u201cI feel bad because I wish I could have been the one to get through and represent the club pros,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s great that they do this for us and I think it draws people in. I brought a lot of people to Louisville and I\u2019m sure a lot of other club pros brought people in. That\u2019s how we promote the game.\u201d Yes sir. Hats off to Helminen, and the other 19 pros, with special mention to Johan Kok of Brentwood, Tennessee who shot a four-under 67 yesterday. A 67! Ask anyone who ever attempted to transport a piano, grandfather clock, crate of delicate family heirlooms or large sheet of plate glass from one location in Hollywood to another during the 1920s or 1930s: moving can lead to all manner of entertaining scrapes. And that\u2019s with only two men wearing brown overalls and bowler hats involved! Look at the significantly larger cast list we\u2019ve got for you on this Moving Day ... Among others we have... Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson. Four-time major winner Ernie Els. The two-time PGA winner Vijay Singh. The current Masters champion Bubba Watson. Erstwhile Masters champions in Zach Johnson, Charl Schwartzel and Adam Scott. Former US Open winners Justin Rose, Graeme McDowell and Jim Furyk. A man who won an Open at St Andrews in Louis Oosthuizen. The legendary veteran Colin Montgomerie. Several other absurdly talented nearly men: Sergio Garcia, Ian Poulter, Hunter Mahan, Lee Westwood, Henrik Stenson and Steve Stricker. And two of the most dependable young major-championship performers of the day, both desperate to make the breakthrough: Rickie Fowler and Jason Day. And they\u2019re all chasing the current world number one, Open champion, and hottest property in golf, Rory McIlroy. All this on a course that\u2019s offering up plenty of birdies. Moving Day promises so much drama, it could only get more exciting should a Ford Model T career into view and mangle Rory\u2019s bag of clubs. It\u2019s on! How the top of the leaderboard looks ... -9: McIlroy -8: Day, Furyk -7: Palmer, Fowler, Ilonen -6: Mickelson, Wiesberger -5: DeLaet, Stricker, Stenson, Luiten, Dubuisson, Westwood, Oosthuizen -4: Watney ... a few of the big names who missed the cut ...
