Why Attenborough should narrate The Apprentice", "bodyText": "Subtitle fails are ten a penny, existing solely to be packaged into the sort of mirthless listicle galleries slung together by low-rent sites purely so your dad can share them on Facebook. But sometimes, just sometimes, magic happens. It happened this weekend, in fact, when an iPlayer glitch meant the text from an episode of Seven Worlds, One Planet played over an episode of The Apprentice. Obviously, this made for rich screenshot material \u2013 a shot of an identikit big-tied candidate gazing neutrally is captioned \u2018the leopard seal is now ready for its next victim\u2019; a moment of boardroom frustration with \u2018this is the toughest time in an animal\u2019s life\u2019. But, besides being unintentionally hilarious, could it have accidentally set an amazing idea in motion: why not get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice? Sure, there will be those of you who\u2019ll deride this as folly. I\u2019ve heard all pf your arguments. Attenborough is a living legend. Attenborough is 93 years old. Attenborough is now explicitly discussing the repercussions of the climate emergency, and diverting him from this mission in order to hear his breathy, awestruck voice narrating the catastrophic uber-capitalism of a bunch of reality TV twits would be to literally endanger the future of the planet as we know it. I\u2019ve heard all your arguments. Heck, I\u2019ve even argued most of them myself. And yet my point remains. Let\u2019s get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice. Come on. It isn\u2019t like he hasn\u2019t narrated people before. He used to do it all the time with The Zoo Quest Expeditions, explaining the traditions and behaviours of the tribespeople he\u2019d come across. And if he can do it for them, why can\u2019t he do it for the sort of bloodless perambulating shark-eyed morons that populate The Apprentice? And maybe it\u2019s actually what this country needs now. Yes yes, plastic is bad, we know that now. But what about hearing a voice of hushed authority explaining the behaviour of the candidates. After all, it helped with tigers. Once, tigers were unknowably ferocious animals who urinated on anything they wanted as a show of might. But now Attenborough has explained the method behind their urination \u2013 it\u2019s a way of communicating surprisingly complex messages with other tigers \u2013 we can understand them a little more. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if he could do the same with the sort of hateful git who applies to be on The Apprentice? Why did that man just say \u201cI love business more than sharks love blood?\u201d Is it because he really is as stupid as he sounds, or is he perhaps communicating a greater understanding of the struggles of life on Earth as we know it? He could dig back into the Apprentice archives if he wanted, and perhaps explain the behaviour of Tre Azam from 2007; a man whose anger at the world was so immediate and overcompensatory that it had to have its roots in some deep genetic species-wide pathology. Perhaps he could discuss how the show\u2019s total absence of morality directly created Katie Hopkins. Perhaps, if nothing else, he could explain why Alan Sugar always looks like a grumpy little hedgehog. Honestly, I\u2019d welcome anything. As I\u2019ve explained again and again, I cannot stand The Apprentice, but if The Greatest Englishman Alive offered to provide a running commentary, I\u2019d be back in like a shot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
