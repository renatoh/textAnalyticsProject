For him the peak of emotion had arrived three weeks earlier and a continent away. It was on a Sunday night in Munich, on the last weekend of August, and Montgomerie was packing up after the BMW International tournament when Bernhard Langer told him, half an hour before the announcement became public, that he would be playing at Oakland Hills as a captain's pick. The news came at the end of months of severe distress for Montgomerie. His marriage had ended, with maximum pain and publicity, and his divorce was a few days from becoming final. He was missing his three children and unsure what the future held. Langer's announcement, however, served to reconnect him with one of the strongest threads running through his adult life, which is his relationship with the tournament invented in 1927 by Samuel Ryder. When he heard Langer's words, Montgomerie let himself go. \"I didn't get emotional this week because I need to think about playing,\" Montgomerie said. \"Today I couldn't get emotional because it wasn't about me. As I've said all along, it was about the team. But I got emotional when Bernhard told me that night in Munich, because I could. I'd been playing poorly this year.\" Then he got down to the business of preparing himself for a competition in which, despite currently appearing no higher than 62nd in the world rankings, he knew he would be seen as a leader. After six previous appearances in the Ryder Cup this time his experience and record would be badly needed. On the course he could concentrate on \"the thing I do best in life, which is play golf\". Off it the week asked more awkward questions. At an event in which much is made of the presence of the players' wives and girlfriends, who are required to put on matching outfits and parade at the pre-tournament gala and the opening and closing ceremonies, he was the only one to arrive unaccompanied. Well, not quite. \"Lee Westwood's wife has just given birth,\" he said, \"so she stayed at home, and Lee and I walked together. He was my date for the week. But I've been alone here and it's not been easy.\" The support of his captain and the other players had been invaluable. \"What meant so much was that Bernhard trusted me,\" he said. \"And even more than that, the team trusted me.\" When someone asked if his recent loss of 36lb had given him greater physical fitness, his eyes suddenly brimmed. \"You wouldn't want to lose weight the way I did,\" he said, shaking his head. What happens next is unclear. \"I'll play out the rest of the year,\" he said, \"and then I'll sit down and take stock of what I'll be doing in 2005. What happens next? Where am I going to live? All those things. I don't know the answers to any of them at the moment.\" He has made it plain that he would very much like to captain the Ryder Cup team, possibly in Ireland in 2006, perhaps later. That ambition has to be balanced against the desire to prolong his playing career. \"I might be too old to be on this team as a player in two years' time,\" he said. \"I'll have to wait and see how things go. If I happen to be in the frame of mind to play, I'd love to play. It's a question of how I can be of most value to the team. How can I give them the biggest number of points? Is it by playing or by captaining, like Bernhard did this week? He certainly earned us some points.\" And the way Langer did it was not lost on Montgomerie, who took mental notes on the way his old friend went about the business of ensuring success against the United States. \"I've played under some very good captains,\" he said. \"You learn from all of them. I've been watching Bernhard this week and I'll probably go home and write down some of the things I've seen. His attention to detail was the thing that impressed us all. He was absolutely meticulous.\" The desire to end his playing career on the right note will play a significant part in any decision about when to make his bid for the captaincy. \"Not many people manage to go out at the top,\" he mused. \"How many can you think of? Michael Jordan and Jackie Stewart. That's about all that come to mind. It's a hard thing to get right.\" He declined to agree with a suggestion that the Ryder Cup was the tournament which would define his career. But before he went off to rejoin the celebrations, someone asked him which of all his days on a golf course - including the seven years in a row that he topped the European order of merit, the eight finishes in the top 10 of a major, and now seven Ryder Cups - had given him the greatest satisfaction. \"This one,\" he said. \"This one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
