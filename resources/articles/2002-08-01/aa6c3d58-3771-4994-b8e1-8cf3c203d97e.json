Bologna scored through two Giuseppe Signori penalties, but one of Fulham's summer signings, the Japanese international midfielder Junichi Inamoto, scored the first equaliser just two minutes after taking to the field and Sylvain Legwinski earned Tigana's side a draw five minutes from the end. The Frenchman's late goal could prove critical to the outcome of this final - one of three in the Intertoto tournament - which will be resolved in the second leg at Craven Cottage on August 27. Fulham's dream of qualifying in European competiton proper for the first time in their history was put to the test here against a Serie A side that include Signori, the former Lazio legend, and the one-time Italy goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca. It was a marked step-up from the early stages of the competition, in which Fulham rather stutteringly overcame opposition like Finland's FC Haka and Egaleo of Greece. But Tigana's side coped admirably in the first half, confidently swapping passes in midfield and occasionally asking the home side, who were playing in front of one of the biggest crowds of the tournament so far, some poignant questions in attack. The inclusion of the striker Barry Hayles was the key to manager Tigana's game-plan. He no doubt figured that Hayles, who insists he wants to stay at Fulham despite a \u00a32m offer from West Bromwich, would provide much-needed urgency in attack considering that it was his future, and not just Fulham's, at stake in this impressive stadium. Certainly Hayles looked lively, and Fulham could so easily have taken the lead when his strike partner Steve Marlet rounded off a powerful run with a 20-yard shot that sailed narrowly over in the 30th minute. But Bologna were not without menace at the other end, where Signori fired a wonderful chance straight at Edwin van der Sar and Giuseppe Colucci sent an even better opportunity into the stands when clean through. Fulham (4-4-2): Van der Sar; Ouaddou, Melville, Goma, Brevett; Malbranque, Davis, Legwinksi, Boa Morte; Hayles, Marlet. Bologna (3-5-2): Pagliuca; Zaccardo, Castellini, Falcone; Nervo, Castellini, Colucci, Goretti, Smit; Cruz, Signori. Referee: E Gonzalez (Spain)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
