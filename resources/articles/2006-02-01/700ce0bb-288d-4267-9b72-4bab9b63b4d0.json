We were wrong. It didn't get the offer it wanted and, on Friday, it pulled out. The Mail was always looking for more than \u00a31.25bn, though the excitement of a big sale soon had enthusiastic observers talking the price up to \u00a31.5bn. The bids don't seem to have got as far as the lower sum, even before contractual haggling over such things as pension funds that would have further reduced actual revenue from any sale. Is this a sign of confidence in the newspaper industry or a sign that the game is up? If you are looking for confidence, you can argue that Northcliffe would have got out at any price if they really thought it was all over. Rather, you might argue, they are like the homeowners who put up their house for sale and, once the estate agents send cleaners round to declutter and freshen up the rooms, realise how much they loved the old place. If, on the other hand, you suspect papers are on their way out, here is the clearest indication yet: in a market that everyone agrees is ripe for further consolidation, rival newspaper groups such as Newsquest could not find a way to reach a valuation that made the Mail sell. And if you want to get really gloomy, you can throw in increasing concern about the future performance of the company's national assets. Some in the Kensington camp believe the brilliant days for the Mail and Mail on Sunday are over. Now it is managed decline and expensive marketing. Why, in that case, get rid of Northcliffe, which brings in more than \u00a3100m profit each year? It is the gloomy story, I am afraid, that the market prefers, for we saw the Mail share price plunge at the news. This being, however, the column that looks on the bright side, let us count the Mail's blessings. When you auction off a big business like Northcliffe, you get the analysts to go through your figures to write a cheerful prospectus for bidders. It's a useful process, not only in enticing bidders, but also in finding value in your business that you may have mislaid. That work done, the Mail began to think it had indeed been pessimistic. A year ago it talked about making \u00a315m worth of savings. That became \u00a320m and, at the start of the sale, \u00a330m. Now it began to think \u00a350m annual savings were possible, enough to push profit margins to the magical 30% achieved by rivals. There was, once it began looking more closely, some real value in its internet operation. And with a little commercial consolidation here and some more modern practices there, why, even the decline in jobs and motor advertising needn't be such a problem. This was cheering internally, but not too exciting for outsiders. The venture capital houses knew they would have no problems making savings, for companies such as Johnston and Trinity Mirror had laid down the model. And they knew that, once costs were taken out, second year profit figures would look terrific. But they couldn't see where growth was going to come from after that. So, at Northcliffe, they ran their figures through the computer and ran the possible purchase prices and decided that it made more sense to call off the deal. For the sentimentalists who populate the British newspaper industry, this is a happy ending. They hated the idea of the Rothermere family departing the business it had built up. But in the hard-hearted world of business, there are tears to come. The first round of cost cutting, aimed at achieving some \u00a320m in savings, has alienated the workforce, in particular the journalists. Now they find themselves back with the parents who tried to put them up for adoption. Morale among journalists in the provinces is not high. This will do nothing to improve it. As for the Mail, it has to get excited all over again about a company it was psychologically out of. Even more difficult, if it is to achieve the cost-cutting measures and the revenue growth its analysis says is possible, it must start behaving not like the paternalistic, journalism-oriented business it has always liked to be, but in the pragmatic, ruthless, manner of the private equity companies to which it decided not to sell. Fun and games beside the Thames The other day I strolled down the Thames to visit the cheerful crew of the Sportsman, busy finding their desks in a handsome new office block overlooking the river at Hammersmith. One shouldn't be carried away by sunshine in the dark days of winter and I know there is always optimism in the early days of a startup. Who can forget the excitement in the air at TV-am, ended when the breakfast station's first band of glamorous broadcasters crashed and burned? Or the glee at the Sunday Correspondent, until the difficulties of entering a crowded market became clear? Yet we must be captivated by a gang that is determined to bring a little of the joy back to newspapers. I found the Telegraph's former chief executive Jeremy Deedes happy to be back in a newspaper office and missing neither a large private office suite nor his winter sun in South Africa. He took me to the type of pub that journalists used to go to 20 years ago, where we were thrilled to have the Irish landlady call us \"boys\" and we ate the kind of sausages that gave British catering such a reputation in the 1970s. The River Cafe, explained my host, is out of bounds to all except the wealthy bookies who might bring advertising to the paper. The last time I saw Charlie Methven he was father of the chapel at the Telegraph and I was editorial director. Now, as editor of the Sportsman, he is offering staff the perks and benefits he demanded in vain from me. This is a dangerous man. Will it work? I don't understand enough about gambling to know. But the \"on dit\" is moving behind it. What people say about papers is very important, the received view often outlasting reality. The \"on dit\" is that the Racing Post has become complacent and that a big market is there for the taking. A successful businessman and racehorse owner said he and his friends believed the Sportsman would work. This is a betting paper rather than a sports paper. What do you write in your headlines to appeal to gamblers? \"England Triumphant\" or \"England Win - World Cup odds cut\"? We shall have to see, but it is clear that the paper is determined to cover everything on which anyone has ever thought of betting. Self-restraint is not self-censorship Did the News of the World worry about the consequences of its videotape showing British soldiers beating up young men in Iraq? The paper's managing editor Stuart Kuttner told Press Gazette that a backlash against British troops could not be allowed to affect decisions: \"The raison d'etre of the media and the press is to publish, and it's the role of journalists to make known things that some will find distasteful, unpleasant and embarrassing. The media should not be in the business of self-censorship.\" He's right, though I find the sanctimonious tone of his comment as distasteful, unpleasant and embarrassing as the activities his paper revealed. Tabloid newspapers are blunt instruments, so that a story about misbehaving soldiers has to be presented in an inflammatory and two-dimensional way. When journalists reveal wrongdoing we work not so much for the greater good of society but for big bylines and fame and money. Stories must be ratcheted up to become the biggest outrage since the last biggest outrage. How do you make the world take notice of the videotape? By presenting it as though it reveals activities as bad as those in Abu Ghraib prison. The approach seemed vindicated by the speed with which the British Army put its hands up and launched a full investigation. The News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, must have been gratified to see columnists on other papers condemn these dreadful acts. Only a few noted that the men assaulted did not appear to have been seriously injured and that there was a riot going on at the time. Yes it was wrong, but end-of-the-world wrong? Reporters who worked on the streets of Northern Ireland, in the British riots of the 1980s or during the miners' strike, saw similar activities by soldiers and police. Over at the Sun, meanwhile, the former SAS man Andy McNab delivered such a compelling justification for the soldiers' behaviour that you might be forgiven for thinking there was rivalry between the daily and its Sunday stablemate. kim.fletcher@dsl.pipex.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
