He is whispery, tremulous in the extreme, and his fragile folky melodies are bolstered with cello and violin; a definite trope in the Glasgow music scene. Still, anyone in part responsible for a record as magnificent as the Delgados' album The Great Eastern may well have something special up his sleeve, and these four tentative songs comprise only his first public appearance since the band split. Brevity would behove newish Chemikal Undergound signings De Rosa: what initially seems ominous and graceful in equal measure outstays its welcome, becoming maudlin in the manner of a fifth-form Thom Yorke impersonation, backed by music of grim competence. One song features the line: \"You are the knife in my appendix,\" which certainly evokes pain, but for all the wrong reasons. Headliners Trashcan Sinatras have survived nearly two decades without any significant commercial success, and have never really belonged to any kind of scene. They appeared long after the brief heyday of Postcard Records, though it's easy to trace a line back from them to the winning self-consciousness of Orange Juice and Aztec Camera's deceptively easy way with a melody. Singer Francis Reader (the brother of Eddi, a bona fide Scottish national treasure) has a gorgeous, warm and reedy voice, and his band, unshackled by the burden of being serious, left-field indie musicians, manage what their predecessors couldn't - tunes with real grace and heart. \u00b7 At Tramway, Glasgow, as part of the Triptych festival, on April 29.
