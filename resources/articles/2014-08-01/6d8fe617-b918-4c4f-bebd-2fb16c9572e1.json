The White House hopes the data will spur and enhance efforts by industry, communities and other sectors to improve water and food security, as well as overall resilience to climate change. A new report from president\u2019s council of economic advisors found that the costs of cutting greenhouse gas pollution and coping with global warming\u2019s impacts would rise by 40% for every decade of delay. It is \u201cclear that not taking action has far greater costs\u201d than prompt action, White House counselor John Podesta told reporters on a press call this week. The newly announced initiatives feature public-private collaborations that aim to render government data on agriculture, weather, climate and water more informative and accessible to businesses and the general public. Three major technology firms have committed to helping researchers crunch the vast amounts of data needed to develop climate models and other analytical tools: Microsoft will competitively select food resilience research projects to receive 12 months of free super-computing time. Amazon will donate 50m hours of computing time and support to researchers, which it will select from applicants to its climate research grants program. IBM will expand its existing World Community Grid program, which harnesses the \u201cspare cycles\u201d from home computers and mobile devices into virtual supercomputers, to make 100,000 years of computing time (worth about $60m, according to an IBM statement) freely available to scientists, along with \u201ca platform to engage the public on their research\u201d. Microsoft has also put US Department of Agriculture data sets online via its Azure Marketplace, and is partnering with the agency to encourage software developers to create new tools for using them. Among the other projects listed: An investment group that includes Rockefeller &amp; Co and European-based institutional investors PGGM, Aberdeen Asset Management, Hermes, MN and Nordea will work with around 50 major food, beverage and apparel companies to improve their resilience to strains in the world\u2019s fresh water supply. The group, formed by the United Nations-related Principles for Responsible Investment, will use water risk data and tools developed by the World Wildlife Fund and PwC (formerly Pricewaterhouse Coopers). Monsanto, which has controversially promoted genetically modified crops and taken small farmers to court to protect its seed patents, stated that it will release data from a multi-year, multi-site corn breeding project into the public sphere, to enhance efforts at forecasting crop production under changing water and climate conditions. There are also a number of university-corporate partnerships, as well as commitments from big data firms Quandl, The Climate Corporation and SWIIM. Several other well-known corporations made commitments that \u2013 while admirable in aspiration \u2013 were light on detail, or seemed to represent ongoing efforts that were shoehorned into the White House\u2019s food-resilience framing: Coca-Cola pledged to expand efforts at quantifying and analyzing various aspects of its global corn supply chain \u2013 including water, energy, and fertilizer use \u2013 towards lowering its overall environmental and climate impacts. Nestle pledged to set \u201cgreenhouse gas reduction targets that are based upon science and incorporating both absolute-carbon and carbon-intensity aspects\u201d. It has already announced a reduction target of 35% per metric ton of goods by 2015. Mars stated it would \u201ccontinue to make major investments in ... food safety and plant science, to create resilience across its agricultural supply chains\u201d, as well as renewable energy. Walmart noted that it is already working with \u201ceight of the largest food companies to ensure that tomorrow\u2019s food supply is more sustainable\u201d - in part by expanding its sustainable agriculture programs by 8 mn acres, although no time frame was mentioned. The White House\u2019s announcement was part of President Obama\u2019s broader \u201cClimate Action Plan\u201d \u2013 announced in June 2013 \u2013 to lower greenhouse gas emissions and prepare American communities for the effects of human-propelled climate change.
