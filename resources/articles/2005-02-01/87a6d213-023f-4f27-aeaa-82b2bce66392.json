Thanks for your many entertaining emails, and the pictures too - it's been spectacularly, heart-rendingly below-par. Rob. WICKET! South Africa 211 all out (b Ali 10) Andrew Hall is done up like a kipper by Ali's slower ball. And that's it. 46th over (of 48): South Africa 210-9 Andre Nel would have been run out by a direct hit but he, erm, wasn't. \"By the sound of this, you would drink this last wicket if you could,\" says Neil Bennett. I'd snort it. WICKET! South Africa 208-9 (Ntini c Strauss b Gough 0) Superb catch from Andrew Strauss, high above his head at long-on, after Ntini clubbed Gough straight down the ground. What was so good about that was that he made such an awkward take look so routine. 45th over (of 48): South Africa 208-8 That was the last ball of the over and you've all gone to the pub as I'm not getting any emails and soon I'll be joining you. WICKET! South Africa 208-8 (Gibbs c Collingwood b Ali 118) Three overs to go, and then I can do one. Beefy encourages Kabir Ali to 'knock that one out'; thankfully he's referring to his propensity for looking at the no-ball line as he runs in to bowl. Gibbs then dumps Ali over midwicket imperiously, and England are being flogged a little bit here. Were being flogged: Gibbs goes aerial again, but only picks out the safe, safe hands of Paul Collingwood. His majestic 118 - got your number, honk etc - is the highest ODI score by a South African against England. And that's Blockbusters. 44th over (of 48): South Africa 197-7 Cracking shot from Gibbs, pulling Wharf for four. The bowler's response is unorthodox: a wide. Then Gibbs backs away and larrups the next one over the top for four: 13 off a pretty poor over. 43rd over: South Africa 184-7 The last two balls of Collingwood yield four runs, as Beefy whinges about the fact that South Africa's innings has resumed. Or is it that there will be a 25-minute gap betwen innings? You'd think someone had dragged him out of the bar or something. State of play cut from Mike Adamson's OBO I can tell you though that play is due to resume at 5.15pm with the game reduced to 48 overs per side. And they're still going to have a 25-minute interval despite having been off the pitch for over an hour! The lazy toads. I'm back The South African innings hasn't finished after all, so if you want some of me - as one of Britain's finest sports writers once enquired of a humble sub-editor after a minor contretemps - at a work Christmas party, you've got it. 4.51pm \"As an avid fan of your OBO I regularly post emails in the hope that I might get mentioned!? After waiting 5 years still nothing!\" says Mark F. \"But like a nutjob Michael Jackson fan hanging about outside that court house, I'm going to keep trying until I do!\" As the judge said in Intolerable Cruelty, I'm going to allow it. If only for the lame analogy and because I'm in such a good mood. And they're off The covers, that is. But there shan't be any play till at least 5pm. \"You and Gav leave Liverpool Street alone tonight,\" says Alex Perkins. \"Please. It hasn't recovered since last time.\" 4.20pm More covers have been called on I'm afraid. So if you're bored, or if you're not, click here. A message to you, Boothy \"Children,\" begins Daniel Ashley. \"This over-by-over malarkey is in danger of descending into an immature in-joke-littered battle over the web between a number of work shy geeks. What? eh, oh etc.\" You knows it. 4.10pm Still raining. \"O'Hanlons at Mount Pleasant has long gone and is now called Mulligans or summat like that. A better than average selection of beers, but not a patch on former glory,\" says the informative Jeremy Pattinson. 4.00pm \"The kind of treat you give them every Friday night down at Walkabout in Shepherd's Bush,\" quips Booth hilariously, before heading off into the night to chat up the nearest Swiss of either sex. \"You know, the one involving your thinning pate and blotchy nose.\" Droll, Booth. Droll. And no, I haven't been to the Shepherd's Bush Walkabout. Booth, however, is that raggy-haired chancer - \"if you don't wash it it washes itself!\" - with the unique pong who sells the Big Issue just outside it. In-laws dept \"Just to be clear I'm not some kind of half-a*sed over bearing big brother, I have no veto over who Eleanor chats up, whatever their profession,\" says Tim Ward. \"However, I draw the line at Daily Mail journalists and people who call other people 'dude'. Hang on, I just called you dude. Bah! PS Is O'Hanlon's up at Mount Pleasant still open/as good as it was? Or is it too far from The Jerusalem to stagger to?\" Not a clue. Dude. The OBO Daddy speaks \"At the risk of sounding distinctly English and so un-post-modern,\" writes Booth in Switzerland, \"why do you think it's in any way big or clever to pepper your prose with \"dude\", \"next!\" and \"whatever\"? You're so much better than that, Smyth. And while we're at it, why not give the ladeez a treat and put up a pic of your grinning mug?\" Define treat. 3.50pm It is absolutely pelting down now. \"Bug. Humbah,\" says Louise Wright. \"Valentines day bites if you're not single too. Anyone who's been going out more than about six months has discovered their partner's range of revolting habits and hence finds it difficult to view them with the same dewy-eyed romance as before, thus rendering the entire debacle a futile sham dreamt up by manufacturers of cards and fripperies. No coincidence it has the initials VD, either.\" The heart bleeds. 3.45pm Fetching shirt , says James Turke. 3.40pm It's all pretty heavy at the moment, dudes - the rain that is - so I would've thought there won't be much play for a while. So I'm off to help with the Fiver. But I shall sporadic updates/emails from Eleanor Ward when I get chance. \"I've always imagined you as looking more like Garth from Wayne's World,\" says Luke Satchell. One word: flattered. Rain stops play Bah! \"Which would you prefer?\" says Sarah Bell. \"For which side do you bat?\" Any side that would take me I'd have thought. \"But am an 'antha' Why such despair anyway - surely the ladies love a funny guy.....\" You're preaching to the converted, dude. WICKET! South Africa 179-7 (Pollock lbw b Collingwood 0) Another one gone, as Pollock plays too late on a gentle off-cutter that trapped him bang in front. \"When I emailed you before during the Test matches about wondering who you were whilst staring out at Guardian Towers, you said you looked like Seth,\" says Eleanor Ward. A little thing I like to call a white lied, dude. \"And then I had a phone call from my brother in which he said one word - [insert your own word for 'stopout' here]. He was accusing me of chatting up Guardian hacks. As if I'd do such a thing...\" Yes, I am making these emails up, and they'll soon get worse. To subscribe to the X-rated OBO, go to www.delusionalsmythianbongofantasies.com 42nd over: South Africa 179-6 Gibbs, who is having a storming series, flashes Ali thought the covers for four to complete a very good hundred, his 15th in ODIs. \"A fairly uninteresting pub crawl would entail sitting in an establishment known as Serjeants, just off Fleet Street, all night long,\" says Glen Christie. HOW IS THAT A BLEEDIN' CRAWL? \"It's a favourite of my workplace's employees but it's soulless and it's rubbish. Mind you, I did have several too many there last night so my drive at work today is at an all time low.\" You shouldn't drive if you've been drinking dude. Honk! More to the point, where should and I my esteemed friend Gavin Monks go drinking: the City, Liverpool Street, Rochester, his place with an OC DVD or none of the above? 41st over: South Africa 172-6 (Gibbs 95, Pollock 0) Two runs and one wicket off that over. Great work. \"I haven't got a date on Valentine's Day and you seem like an entertaining guy (and most importantly - you fit my essential criteria of being into cricket!). You could always go on a date with me. And despite being a student, I am everso slightly older than you. How about it?\" says Emily Crick, 94. WICKET! South Africa 171-6 (Kemp c Strauss b Gough 0) Justin Kemp, entirely predictably, fails miserably. Very well bowled by Darren Gough, who pinned Kemp on the back foot and was rewarded with a top-edged hook that flew to fine leg. Well bowled Goughy, I take it all back. \"Re over 35,\" says Paul Baker. \"Is that the same Tom Aldred that once turned up to a Smyth birthday bash after getting sloshed with his boss at the expense of some Gin Lord that he was visiting for 'work'?\" You knows it. 40th over: South Africa 170-5 \"Socks question seemed like a good opportunity for you to write Next as the answer,\" says Tim Aldridge, presuming a brain cell on my part. It all makes sense now. \"Nevermind.\" Good album. WICKET! South Africa 169-5 (Boucher c Ali b Wharf 24) Here comes the charge: Boucher, moving his feet like a Junior Senior disciple, smites Wharf back over his head for four. And then he makes a mockery of that sentence by falling next ball, uppercutting straight to third man. Here comes Justin Kemp. \"Cojones in the grinder time,\" says Ben Hendy, with worrying malevolence. \"Who'd gonna win this one then, Mr Smyth? (is that suitable respect for you in your role as MC for the OBO coverage?)\" Nuff respect. South Africa. By 66 runs. Keep it futile. 39th over: South Africa 164-4 Another excellent over from the returning Gough, who is bowling as well as I've seen since the Lord's Test of 2001. \"Since you obviously have little to lose, why not replace Dazzler with a picture of your good self, and wait for the offers to roll in?\" says Sarah Cockle. Well, just a little thing I like to call dignity. But if you send me an email I'll send you a pic. No, really. 38th over: South Africa 160-4 (Gibbs 90, Boucher 17) Alex Wharf returns, as Gibbs moves into the 90s, and if one more person sends me an oh-so-funny response to the question in over 36, we may have a problem. \"Alex Wharf has just dragged the odd one down,\" says Beefy, the man who spends his entire commentary stint dragging every single Tom, Dick and Trevor Hohns down to his level. \"Where do you buy your socks?\" asks Tim Aldridge. 37th over: South Africa 154-4 \"I know it's a rhetorical question Tom,\" says Nick Hood, \"but a Brannigans and Yates' only pub crawl would top that. Rat Boy heaven.\" A bouncer once started on me in the toilets in Yates' for no reason. Brilliant. 36th over: South Africa 144-4 The end of a good spell from Ashley Giles: 10-0-40-1. \"Do you have a date for Valentine's Day yet?\" says Sam Bell, steadfastly refusing to put me out of my not inconsiderable misery by adding a 'uel' or 'antha'. No. Next. 35th over: South Africa 137-4 (Gibbs 75, Boucher 13) Collingwood back for Vaughan, and just two off a pretty good over. \"From the thousands of brilliant and varied pubs in one of the world's greatest cities, a friend of mine is suggesting a pub crawl tomorrow night encompassing only those run by JD Wetherspoon,\" laments Tom Aldred. \"Could anyone suggest a more soulless pub crawl in London?\" Upper 'Emperor's New Clothes' Street? 34th over: South Africa 135-4 (Gibbs 74, Boucher 12) Give me that f- GIMME THAT FIGGIN ANORAK YA BADGER. This is Gibbs's highest ODI score at Durban. Fact. 33rd over: South Africa 131-4 A boundary! A real one! The first for 14 overs! How did it come about? Who cares! It's a boundary! Ok, Boucher got down on one knee and swept Vaughan flat, square and true to the fence. The life and times of David Keech \"I have now sent GU approx. 50 e-mails over the ODI series without a single one being published. Is this a record? Is it because: (a) My e-mails are booring? (b) You are focussing on another topic? (c) You can't be bothered to even look at them? (d) Some other reason? It's (e): whatever. 32nd over: South Africa 123-4 As Bob Willis shrewdly - yes I did say that - observes, South Africa are placing all their eggs in a basket named Justin Kemp. Like a Kings Of Convenience fan with his iPod on random, he's due a failure. Sorry. \"Duuuuuuude,\" implores Luke Satchell. \"Like you musta been about three years old in 1989 dude. And since Beefy dismissals are like, way less frequently shown on clip shows or whatever than massive hoiks down to cow, how do you like know all this stuff? I makes me go all like, 'Whooooah!' Teewtally.\" 31st over: South Africa 118-4 Four from another useful Vaughan over, and the last 41 runs have all been singles. \"Since you didn't ask, the prize for the most inevitably named OU presenter has to go to the Physics guy, Stuart Freake,\" says Simon Francis. \"Best moment ever was when he was demonstrating harmonics by taking off his shirt and sitting on a vibrating chair. The wildly gyrating hairy man-boobs were strangely hypnotic..\" 30th over: South Africa 114-4 (Gibbs 65, Boucher 0) \"I watched an OU programme once. It was about learning French. It was all in French so I didn't understand it. Does this not fly in the face of the OU's aim of learning and development? Or am I just stupid?\" asks Phil from Newcastle, giving us a tantalising clue as to the answer with that last piece of information. WICKET! South Africa 114-4 (Prince c Collingwood b Giles 27) Stunning catch from Paul Collingwood. Prince charged down the pitch and whapped across the lines at Giles; the ball was racing through midwicket when Collingwood plucked it effortlessly - two-handed, high above his head - before celebrating with the nonchalance of a man who'd just been asked for his number by Keira Knightley and said: 'Not today, dude, I'm washing my hair'. Brilliant fielding, and here's Mark Boucher. 29th over: South Africa 111-3 Boucher, rather than Kemp, is padded up. No, no idea dudes. Just 23 runs from the last seven overs, meanwhile. \"Has this sudden interest in 70s science shows been stimulated by the weird and wonderful 'Look Around You' on BBC 2?\" says Alex Turrell. I'd love to purport to such sophisticated thought processes, but it has more to do with the fact that OU sounds a bit like OC. 28th over: South Africa 107-3 (Gibbs 61, Prince 24) The two spinners are doing a decent job of constricting South Africa here, and here's John Swain. \"There's another Athers-autobiog story about that Botham/Hohns dismissal. Apparently, when he got back to the dressing-room, Beefy apologised and said the bat had got wedged behind his pad. Goochy improved the dressing-room atmosphere no end by asking, 'Where was yer pad, Beefy, on yer f****n 'ead?'\" Like the Zimbabwean cricket team, that's priceless. Oh dear. 27th over: South Africa 104-3 Fifty partnership in 73 balls, and these two are setting up nicely for some more howitzing from Justin Kemp. \"Stop ignoring me Smytho,\" says Tom Hopkins. \"Lucy Smyth is leaving her exciting job today and I'd like to give her a big shout out [what is this, Chris figgin Moyles?] and thank her for putting up with rubbish jokes about why her brother's such an angry man on his OBOs [I'm not angry, kids, just misunderstood. And I'm happy today anyway. And just say no.]. By the way, she claims you're not actually her brother but I have my doubts. Confirmation?\" Confirmed. 26th over: South Africa 100-3 As usual, we're experiencing the calm between the storms, and once again all the runs in that over - all two of them - come in singles. \"Smythy,\" begins Jonny Sultoon, with a familiarity that frankly makes my bum squeak with unease. \"Was it you or Boothy who suggested the Betsey Trotwood for lunch a month or so ago? Well, I've just come back from there and quite frankly The Eagle is infinitely better. I think you just prefer the marginally small price list. Stioudent. Next!\" Booth. Next! 25th over: South Africa 98-3 Vaughan comes on for Kabir Ali, a shrewd move I think given the sleepy nature of proceedings and the fact that England still need eight fill-in overs from somewhere. Four off the over. Here's David Green. \"My favourite OU moment ever was when the typically long haired, bearded cell, brown sweatered Biology professor, pulled out some tins of bitter to demonstrate cell structures. Genius.\" Is that the one with the Dandy Warhols on the soundtrack and where Seth has that cool brown tracky top on. 24th over: South Africa 94-3 (Gibbs 55, Prince 17) Giles has a biggish lbw shout against Prince rightly turned down by Simon Taufel. \"Yeah, it was outside the line,\" opines Beefy, who still manages to make it sound like he's spoiling for some rough stuff. \"Andrew Small is 27 and still saying dude?\" ponders Gary Westfallen. \"There's failure written all over him.\" Yes, I am 29. What of it? Failure in life is totally the new success. 23rd over: South Africa 90-3 (Gibbs 53, Prince 15) \"The tour finishes soon, and I'm worried about getting Bob Willis withdrawal symptoms,\" says Chris Bishop. \"If I asked nicely do you reckon The King of Hindsight could come and tell me what I'm doing wrong?\" 22nd over: South Africa 88-3 (Gibbs 52, Prince 14) It took Beefy seven balls - seven whole balls - to start chuntering. And, to make a change, it's about exactly the same as it was the other day: Ashley Giles's field, which allows the SA batsman to nurdle at will. Beefy would doubtless be happy if the field was up so that the batsmen could try and do to Giles what Beefy did to Trevor Hohns so ingeniously at Manchester in 1989. 21st over: South Africa 84-3 (Gibbs 50, Prince 12) Gibbs completes a cracking 63-ball 50. Even Ian Botham is impressed, which suggests he's played pretty well. Two off the over as I settle snugly into the seat of love. \"I strongly suspect that the 'Andrew Hall' who just emailed in about doing a maths test is actually my colleague Andrew \"Andy\" Small,\" says Paul Callinan. \"Was it a typo though or is the dude using a false name in a weak attempt to disguise the fact that he's not doing any work?\" Ah, it's the former Paul. Ingle is blushing as we speak. Afternoon dudes I'm exquisitely happy. And so, today, there'll be no talking about the OC. In a desperately vain attempt to save my journalistic credibility I'd welcome mails about the OU, BBC 2's finest, especially from anybody who happens to enjoy watching 1970s throwbacks in front of 'chalkboards' explaining atomic structure in a beige studio. 20th over: South Africa 82 - 3 (Gibbs 49, Prince 11) Another typical ODI over from Giles with lots of easy singles but not much else. \"If Andrew Hall's doing his Maths test - who's coming in at no 9?\" asks Paul McGrath (and about 150 others). 19th over: South Africa 78 - 3 (Gibbs 47, Prince 8) After a muscly swing through gully brings Prince his first boundary, Ali tightens up and nearly takes a wicket when he nearly cuts Gibbs in half before going for four byes. \"If we're talking rubbish cricketer haircuts, what about Wayne Larkins' kinky afro?\" asks Richard Lardham. 18th over: South Africa 69 - 3 (Gibbs 47, Prince 4) Collingwood went for 19 off two overs so no surprise that he's replaced by Giles. Still, they're in a good position, so heaven knows why England's field is very defensive - mid on and mid off are both back on the boundary - which is allowing all-too-easy singles. \"I love the way you dudes email each other on your days off,\" says Andrew Hall. \"A drunken Barry Glendenning in the Super Bowl was my favourite but news from another land from Monsieur Booth is good too. I have a maths test in less than an hour, how the hell am I supposed to follow the cricket then, and I'm 27 for the love of god.\" 17th over: South Africa 65 - 3 (Gibbs 44, Prince 3) A huge, huge six from Gibbs who is looking more set than the Flock of Seagulls' hair circa 1982. \"How can there be two threads discussing both bad haircuts and Pietersen's selection for England without either discussion crossing over?\" asks Neill Halliday. \"Surely the horrors he has inflicted on his barnet has now spread and caused disquiet in the dressing room (see Gough!). Perhaps the feeling is that if we can match their poor haircuts we can match the Aussies in the Ashes?\" 16th over: South Africa 58 - 3 (Gibbs 37, Prince 3) Prince isn't going delirious just yet, but a well-run three takes him off the mark. \"Ho ho ho! Surely I'm not the first to point out the irony of Bacher getting out to Ali, which is coincidentally his father's first name!\" chuckles Jeremy Hughes to himself. In his lonely bedsit. Probably. WICKET! 15th over: lbw Ali Bacher 15 Bacher goes! Ali gets one to stay straight and low and Bacher is caught absolutely plum. It's a wicket-maiden too. \"If there's any justice in the world then Graham Gooch's transplant deserves a mention,\" suggests Ed Collington. 14th over: South Africa 52 - 2 (Bacher 15, Gibbs 35) Like a pacifist angler, England are letting South Africa off the hook here. Collingwood replaces Wharf is is picked off by both Gibbs and Bacher and 14 runs come from the over. \"If anyone's thinking of popping over to the Swiss Alps for a spot of skiing in the next few days, don't\", writes my colleague Lawrence Booth, who is currently sheltering from the sleet in Adelboden. \"Still, it beats being called 'dude' by Smyth at GU Central.\" 13rd over: South Africa 38 - 2 (Bacher 10, Gibbs 26) A first change in the bowling as Ali replaces Gough. Two boundaries come from the over: the first a perfect punch through the covers, the second a streaky shot past the missing second slip. \"Scott Styris's 1920's-style cut with a step at the back. There were no mirrors in that barbers\" says the wise Colin Moors. 12th over: South Africa 30 - 2 (Bacher 10, Gibbs 18) A first boundary for Bacher! Not that it was convincing, mind. Wharf dropped one into short, and Bacher's edged-scoop flew just over Pietersen before racing away for four. \"What about Dominic Cork's hair band effort?\" suggests Phil Makings. \"If ever a reason for not fulfilling talent was encapsulated in a plastic object, it was in that band.\" 11th over: South Africa 25 - 2 (Bacher 6, Gibbs 18) Bacher is still looking rabbit-in-a-headlight nervous. Still, despite two Gough lbw appeals he hangs on. For now. \"Claire, 442 runs from 444 balls, I don't care,\" says Charles McIntosh re: the Pietersen debate. 10th over: South Africa 23 - 2 (Bacher 5, Gibbs 17) An amusing moment as Wharf and Gibbs clatter into each other as the latter attempts a second run. Otherwise Gibbs continues to keep the scoreboard moving. \"Surely Aussie military medium merchant Colin 'Funky' Miller deserves a look-in for the worst hairdo?\" suggests Stuart Peskett. \"Didn't it go from canary yellow to pillarbox red to, er... bright blue?\" 9th over: South Africa 19 - 2 (Bacher 5, Gibbs 14) Another Gough over full of fire and fight. He's only conceded four runs in five overs: quite something for a bowler who was supposedly finished two years ago. \"Am I too late with the Wharf puns?\" asks Philip Smith. \"It looks like South Africa will be the ones Kling(ing) on.\" Oh dear oh dear. 8th over: South Africa 17 - 2 (Bacher 4, Gibbs 12) Gibbs on the charge! Wharf has bowled an impeccable line so far, but he overpitches one, then drops the next delivery short - and both times he's slaughtered to the boundary. \"Has anyone else been telling annoying South African colleagues that ODIs are monkey tennis after going 3-1 down only to have suddenly found a new passion for the game in the past ten minutes?\" asks John MacKay. 7th over: South Africa 9 - 2 (Bacher 4, Gibbs 4) Gough's Indian summer continues: another great over, including a shout for a caught behind off Bacher (it came off his pad), keeps South Africa pinned in. \"Re: Pietersen: Mike Atherton talks in his autobiography about being told on his debut by a 'senior England player' that he'd play his first five Tests for love and the rest for money,\" says Stephen P. \"If he doesn't disrupt the dressing room, get Pietersen in the Test team.\" 6th over: South Africa 8 - 2 (Bacher 4, Gibbs 3) Bacher gets off the mark with a meaty off drive and the klaxons blare for the first time today. \"Am I right in thinking there are bullet tips and East 17-esque shaven stripes on display in Gough's hairdo. If so, he must now rank top of the worst cricket hairdos of all time,\" reckons Duncan Wilbur. Two words, Duncan: Jason Gillespie. And two more: Ian Harvey (actually, half the Australian team for that matter). 5th over: South Africa 3 - 2 (Bacher 0, Gibbs 2) Gough's go-faster stripes (see picture) are clearly working. Another maiden, and Bacher has faced 16 balls without getting off the mark. \"Does anyone else have a sense of disquiet over Kevin Pietersen playing for England,\" asks Claire Michaels. \"He's a great player, but he's about as English as Castle lager.\" WICKET! Kallis c Strauss b Wharf 0 (South Africa 1-2) /B&gt; Kallis goes first ball! He tries to pull him through midweek but is surprised by Wharf's pace and bounce (as are Smythy and myself to be honest) and scythes one high into the air - and straight into Strauss's hands at second slip. Gibbs fends away the hat-trick ball, but England are in control. 4th over: WICKET! Smith c Trescothick b Wharf (South Africa 1 - 1) Wharf strikes! He bowls one just outside off stump and Smith can't resist nibbling one to first slip. 3rd over: South Africa 1 - 0 (Smith 1, Bacher 0) Bacher looks a bundle of nerves and tics out there. He goes for a run which isn't on, only to be shouted back by Smith, then plays and misses at a fizzer that leaves him. Maiden. And, at this rate [famous last words alert] I wouldn't bank on him improving his ODI average of 19.11. Second over: South Africa 1 - 0 (Smith 1, Bacher 0) Now here's a surprise: Alex Wharf opens the bowling. And even more of a surprise is how, despite (a) not playing all tour, and (b) not being much kop, he bowls a maiden. Meanwhile the number of people making rubbish Star Trek/ Lieutenant Wharf puns is already in double figures. You should be ashamed of yourselves. First over: South Africa 1 - 0 (Smith 1, Bacher 0) Oh dear. Two balls in and England's fielding is already looking dodgier than a reheated late-night kebab: Smith gets a nick which gently falls short of the slips and is somehow fumbled by both Trescothick and Strauss. Still, good first over from Gough. \"What is Goughy thinking? Still, you were nearly on the money with 'swanky'\" reckons Neal Rafferty. Pre-amble: South Africa have won the toss and, not surprisingly seeing as this Durban pitch looks at belter, have elected to bat. That's another 300 on the board, then. As for the team news, England have brought in the frankly average Alex Wharf for the out-of-sorts Matthew Hoggard, while South Africa have, rather surprisingly, dropped AB de Villiers and Nicky Boje for Adam Bacher and Andrew Hall. \"Despite reading much about Darren Gough's swanky new hairdo, I have yet to see a picture,\" says Andrew Jolly. \"Can you oblige?\" Consider it done, Mr Jolly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
