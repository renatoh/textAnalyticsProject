The former England and Southampton striker, now well established in his second career as a racehorse trainer, is naturally keen to see the national side do well over the coming weeks and believes they can win the World Cup, but part of him would be delighted to see Diego Maradona lift the trophy. \"I would love to see Argentina win,\" he says, leaning well back in his chair and glancing up at a giant photo of him and Alan Ball in their playing days that dominates the office at his West Ilsley stable. \"He's a rebel, isn't he, Maradona. And he was a great, great player.\" A wealthy man who trains from a yard he bought from the Queen, Channon might be thought an unlikely nonconformist but he appreciates the trouble-making streak he sees in the Argentina coach. \"He's just gone against the whole system. He's totally against everything they think you should have. \"They think you should go to an academy and pass exams and everything else, he's never done a thing like that. I want to keep that kind of freedom and that [sense of] 'let's get in and play football'. Rather than be disciplined, I'd want to keep a bit of that flair. Because if you lose that flair that the Brazilians and Argentina bring, then football won't be the same. \"A lot of the Africans are very talented. Whether they've got the discipline and the team structure, I've got my doubts. But they could be good to watch because, again, they're carefree, they're playing their football with no restrictions and that's quite refreshing. Whereas in Europe now we're very disciplined and don't give anything away and sit tight.\" His assessment of England's chances could be described as cautiously hopeful. He feels the squad contains \"more world-class players than most\" but is deeply frustrated that Fabio Capello has not been clear in identifying his best 11 players and describes the team's preparation as \"shit\". \"Fabio, I haven't got a problem with him, but what I have got a problem with is, we don't know what his team is. I hope he does. He says he does but he has about 500 changes every game and that I can't understand. I would have thought the last three or four games, you would have played your best team. \"Then they know each other, they know what they're gonna get. Your players don't have to think, they don't have to worry, they know what they're going to do.\" All this is said, not with anger, but in a bantering manner that Channon clearly enjoys. \"I don't know, I'm just a supporter, I'm no different to you,\" he says. \"I used to be a footballer but I ain't got a clue. I've got my views, same as everyone. The great thing is, the whole bloody country's excited about it. There's a buzz about the place and we're all trying to live our lives around the football. \"It is tough times and it's bringing people together. It was great to see, on the news this morning, all those [army] lads in Afghanistan, what a shit life they've got . . . playing in their boots and wishing the England team all the best. \"It means so much to an awful lot of people who've got shit jobs to do, people who've got no money. Football's great at raising the hopes of the nation \u2013 not just here but Brazil and Spain and Italy and Germany.\" Channon, it should be understood, is not referring to his own job. He looks a picture of contentment as he climbs into a four-by-four that will take him up to his gallops, where he will oversee the final preparations of his own team, bound for Royal Ascot next week. Flat racing's greatest festival will dominate his thoughts over the next eight days, though he is determined to be in front of a TV screen when England play Algeria on Friday evening. \"I don't know what state I'll be in after half a dozen winners at Ascot, though.\" That afternoon will bring his biggest chance of making his own headlines, when Music Show lines up in the Coronation Stakes. \"We want her to go and win. If she can, it'll probably put our season back on track a little bit. I mean, our horses are running well but she's the one that we could do with coming good for us.\" The filly ran well to be sixth from an impossible draw in the 1,000 Guineas and was then third in the Irish equivalent, narrowly beaten by Bethrah and Anna Salai, both of which may line up against her on Friday. Channon does not want to make excuses for her but feels she may have been trapped a little too wide off the rail in the Irish race. \"She was just always having to do that little bit [extra] round there,\" he says, pointing out that Ryan Moore was never able to get a breather into the three-year-old. \"I think Ascot will suit her.\" Unexpectedly Channon will be the owner as well as the trainer of Galtymore Lad, a 16-1 shot in Tuesday's Coventry Stakes. He formerly co-owned the juvenile with Harry Findlay but the flamboyant gambler was banned for six months in a shock decision by the sport's ruling body yesterday. \"It's just crazy,\" says Channon, who, like many others in the sport, is not persuaded that Findlay did anything wrong. He is, indeed, so incensed by the decision that he accuses the British Horseracing Authority of bringing the sport into disrepute. If the trainer is right, Galtymore Lad has a real chance of a poignant victory. \"No one knows how good he is, even me, because he's so laid back at home. He won the other day, very impressively, at Pontefract, and beat five winners that night. I'm not saying he's the greatest horse in the world but he beat them by four lengths.\" Youmzain, the best horse Channon has trained and the runner-up three times in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, will probably miss Ascot in favour of a race at Saint-Cloud but the stable will still have plenty of live candidates next week. The trainer makes particular mention of Chilworth Lad in the Windsor Castle on Tuesday, Please Sing in the next day's Royal Hunt Cup and Rileyskeepingfaith in the Wokingham a week tomorrow. \"I think it's a good team but, apart from Music Show, we aren't expected to win, there's no pressure. It's good, fun racing and our horses are in great nick, so we're ready to go there and I think, with a bit of luck, we could have a winner or so.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
