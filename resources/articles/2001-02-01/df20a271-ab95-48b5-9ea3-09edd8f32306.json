Mr Purnell, 31 on Friday, has been selected for the safe seat of Stalybridge and Hyde, in Greater Manchester, in an open selection. He worked for Mr Blair in opposition, before joining the BBC as a strategic adviser and then joining the No 10 policy unit. London-born Mr Purnell's ability to win a safe Labour seat against strong local competition will be a relief to Mr Blair, who in the past has been accused of imposing Blairite candidates against the wishes of local constituencies. There has been speculation that the prime minister wants to impose a string of talented candidates at the last minute, but Millbank believes Downing Street has learnt its lessons from previous efforts to control nominations from the centre. Mr Purnell won on the first ballot. He succeeds Tom Pendry, the former shadow sports minister, in a seat Labour has held since 1945. Hilary Benn, a former employment department special adviser, won Leeds Central in a byelection, and Jon Cruddas, Downing Street's former trade union liaison officer, was selected for the safe seat of Dagenham, in Essex. In selections to come, Tom Watson, an engineering union official, is expected to win the nomination for West Bromwich East. Kevin Jones, a GMB official, is a strong runner for Durham North."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
