The intense schedule of presentations, many costing well into seven figures, has been established for decades. It has traditionally been a closed shop; an exclusive, invitation-only cabaret for the style cognoscenti. But things are changing, and some industry insiders are now predicting the demise of this exhausting and indulgent showcase of designer theatrics as its relevance in an era of fashion democracy, instant gratification and tech innovation is questioned. The fashion formula has, frankly, become tired, and the industry is starting to lag behind others in its lack of creative vision. It\u2019s against this background that one should consider an initially surprising technology-to-fashion transfer last week \u2013 the announcement that Ian Rogers, the head of Apple Music, is to join the fashion and luxury house LVMH as its new \u201chead of digital\u201d. \u201cWe are reaching the nadir of the current fashion-season cycle and it is about to fall apart,\u201d says Chris Sanderson, co-founder of the Future Laboratory, a British-based trend forecasting consultancy. \u201cBrands these days should be seeking an audience of 3 million, not 300, and increasingly, they are looking at alternative ways to present products to their customers.\u201d Certainly, the advent of social media, influential style bloggers and live-streaming of events already means that anyone in the world can enjoy the front-row experience instantaneously, as long as they have a connected digital device. However, this week in Manhattan, the Paris-based atelier Givenchy will be shaking things up a little. The familiar faces of the \u201cfrow\u201d will take their places as usual, via a separate entrance, and behind the ranks of stylists and critics will be 200 local fashion students, invited to attend by the label\u2019s creative director, Riccardo Tisci. Then, in an unprecedented move, the esteemed 63-year-old French fashion house, founded by French aristocrat Count Hubert de Givenchy and now owned by LVMH, will open the doors of its spring show to 820 members of the public on a first-come, first-served basis. It is a sign that the fashion industry is now not just about selling clothes, but is slowly integrating with other sectors to form part of a more nebulous industry of luxury-entertainment experiences. \u201cThe first myth to dispel is that the fashion industry is ahead of the curve,\u201d says Sanderson. \u201cIt is, ironically, exactly the opposite. Most fashion businesses are extremely conservative and very reactionary. Thankfully, we are now slowly witnessing a long overdue cross-fertilisation of fashion, tech and leisure \u2013 and this is really making things very exciting.\u201d The global consumer now views Apple as a luxury brand alongside the likes of Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton and Chanel, and tech as very much part of a trendsetting, aspirational agenda. So it makes sense that the Californian electronics-and-entertainment giant has made a number of significant hirings in recent years to boost its fashion credentials. Former Yves St Laurent chief executive Paul Deneve joined in 2013 to work under Apple boss Tim Cook on \u201cspecial projects\u201d, bringing in YSL\u2019s European president and head of retail, Catherine Monier, to work with him last year. In May 2014, former Burberry chief Angela Ahrendts took her place on the Apple board, while the former social media chief for Nike and Burberry, Musa Tariq, joined the company last year as digital marketing director. But while the geek community has gradually been infiltrated by a dose of high gloss and glamour, it\u2019s taken time for the reverse to be true. Yes, a generation of digital whizzkids have taken their seats in the e-commerce divisions of big brands, facilitating the growth of digital clothing sales from the back end (albeit gradually: to this day, the likes of Chanel, C\u00e9line and Rolex do not have transactional websites). But there has been a distinct lack of true tech visionaries in executive roles in the world of luxury goods and high fashion \u2013 until now. It\u2019s rumoured that Natalie Massenet, the visionary founder of online designer boutique Net-A-Porter (who resigned from the business last week with a \u20ac100m payoff) was close to hiring former Apple Europe boss Pascal Cagni as Net-A-Porter\u2019s chief executive when parent company Richemont announced the merger of her venture with Italian e-commerce giant Yoox. That move didn\u2019t happen but now LVMH has landed Rogers. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying to many of my key clients for some time that they need to have a young, tech-savvy brain on their board,\u201d says Moira Benigson, founder and managing partner of headhunter MBS Group, which specialises in consumer, retail and fashion. \u201cWe are recruiting for the future century, and many [fashion] businesses are living in the past. Most people who are strong leaders in fashion are traditionally from a sales or business background. Now, I think you have to be more rounded, more savvy and have some handle on the potential of tech. I think the fashion industry got left behind and they\u2019re just waking up to the brave new world.\u201d It seems that fashion businesses are acknowledging they are no longer mere clothiers and that today\u2019s luxury brand has to be a purveyor of interactive lifestyle experiences that embrace technological innovation as an integral part of their offering. \u201cThe next leap we will see is the expansion of wearables,\u201d says Sanderson. \u201cIntelligent fabrics have been talked about by trend forecasters for 20 years, but the technology exists now and it\u2019s simply about cost, implementation and taking customers beyond the \u2018bump\u2019. \u201cSo, we can embed technology in garments that will alert a store to your shopping habits, previous purchases, what you\u2019ve tried on in another boutique, your average spend, colour preferences and so on. Clothes can do the talking \u2013 so you have a discreet, sophisticated dialogue with your favourite brands and the stores can then provide a truly tailored service designed to make blitz marketing obsolete.\u201d Historically, the fashion world\u2019s adoption of digital has been limited to online boutiques and social media marketing \u2013 all too often featuring pointless tweets and a plethora of Instagram images done without real thought as to the value they add. \u201cThe luxury and fashion world has been incredibly slow to embrace tech in its truest, cleverest form,\u201d says fashion tech expert Shannon Edwards. \u201cIt is going to be very hard for them to change, especially when you are talking about craftsmanship, heritage, history \u2013 they want to hold on to those things, so it\u2019s an evolution.\u201d But, she adds, we have reached the point where digital technology as a standalone industry melts away and starts to become a key part of other industries, especially fashion. \u201cI have really high hopes for the integration of tech into clothing, so we use augmented reality to bring garments to life in front of you and smart fabrics to communicate information. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it all converges properly and we will get our heads out from our smartphones and get back to using tech, so we are more engaged as socially active humans again.\u201d So, as fashion editors pack their bags for the launch of the catwalk merry-go-round this week \u2013 and use Periscope to transmit close-up footage from their front-row seats \u2013 this might be the swansong of the catwalk show as we know it. The future is looking like the next big thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
