The president and Sanders expressed mutual admiration that suggested the parting was amicable. Trump first announced her departure via Twitter then spoke of her in glowing terms at an unrelated event at the White House. He described Sanders as \u201ca magnificent person\u201d and who has done \u201can incredible job\u201d. Sanders promised that she would continue to be \u201cone of the most outspoken and loyal supporters of the president and his agenda\u201d \u2013 raising the prospect that she could follow her predecessor, Sean Spicer, into becoming a political pundit on channels such as Fox News. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to have an incredible six more years,\u201d she added. Sanders will not be missed by Trump\u2019s critics. Matthew Miller, a former justice department spokesperson, tweeted: \u201cGood riddance. She had the most important spokesperson job in the world and used it to lie repeatedly to the American people. I hope shame and stigma follow her the rest of life.\u201d Sanders, daughter of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, took over from Spicer in July 2017. She was the third woman to hold the position. She was one of the closest and most trusted White House aides and one of the few remaining who worked on his campaign. Sanders provided stability after Spicer\u2019s series of wayward gaffes and, unlike other Trump officials, stayed in his good graces with her unswerving, often ostentatious shows of loyalty. In January she told the Christian TV network CBN that \u201cGod wanted Donald Trump to become president\u201d. Sanders amplified Trump\u2019s attacks on the media, sometimes clashing with CNN correspondent Jim Acosta in the briefing room, and notoriously made false claims on behalf of the president, deepening questions about the administration\u2019s credibility. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report revealed that Sanders admitted to investigators that she had made an unfounded claim that \u201ccountless\u201d FBI agents had got in touch to express support for Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI director James Comey in May 2017. Sanders later claimed her comments were \u201ca slip of the tongue\u201d and made in \u201cthe heat of the moment\u201d. It was also on her watch that the daily press briefing, a staple of past administrations, became irregular and all but petered out. There has been no briefing for the past three months, effectively replaced by impromptu gatherings with reporters in the White House driveway, and by Trump\u2019s own question-and-answer sessions on the South Lawn. Sanders becomes the latest in a long list of White House departures; Trump has presided over a record turnover of staff. He has not yet announced a successor. At the press conference on Thursday, Trump summoned Sanders to join him at podium. The 36-year-old beamed as he said: \u201cShe\u2019s going to be leaving the service of her country and she\u2019s going to be going \u2013 I guess you could say private sector \u2026 She comes from a great state, Arkansas, that was a state that I won by a lot, so I like it.\u201d Trump added: \u201cIf we can get her to run for the governor of Arkansas, I think she\u2019ll do very well. I\u2019m trying to get her to do that \u2026 She\u2019s a very special person, a very, very fine woman, she has been so great, she has such heart, she\u2019s strong but with great, great heart, and I want to thank you for an outstanding job.\u201d Trump kissed Sanders on the head amid applause. She took the podium, visibly resisting tears, and said: \u201cThis has been the honour of a lifetime, the opportunity of a lifetime. She said she had \u201cloved every minute, even in the hard minutes, I\u2019ve loved it. \u201cI love the president. I love the team that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work for. The president is surrounded by some of the most incredible and most talented people you could ever imagine and it\u2019s truly the most special experience. The only one I can think of that might top it just a little bit is the fact that I\u2019m a mom. I have three amazing kids and I\u2019m going to spend a little more time with them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
