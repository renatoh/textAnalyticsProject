An unprecedented four Premier League clubs have marched on to the Champions League quarter-finals, generating widespread adulation that we have Europe's most brilliant league, yet this summer's European Championship will take place without . In the Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United second-leg teams which beat Internazionale and Milan, Olympiakos and Lyon, just 10 English players, less than a quarter, featured in the starting line-ups. Fabio Capello, the Italian coach hired at vast expense to fashion a national team from this material, has complained he does not have enough players to choose from. The FA's new independent chairman, Lord Triesman, has reopened the suggestion that English clubs might select a defined number of home-grown players in their squads, as Uefa requires for Champions League matches. The Premier League, however, remains adamantly opposed to \"quotas\" - because it says its own clubs will not honour the rule's spirit. A player qualifies as home-grown not by nationality, but by having been at a club for three years between the age of 15 and 21. The league argues its clubs would only intensify their worldwide scouting, to get overseas young players into academies earlier so they qualify as home-grown, thereby actually decreasing openings for English players. While battle lines begin to be drawn on that, all agree that coaching of our own young players has to improve. The FA launched its \"Charter for Quality\" 11 years ago, permitting professional clubs to recruit children as young as eight into academies, yet now they admit a generation went through with coaches who mostly did not have the expertise to handle them. Yesterday Triesman and the FA's chief executive, Brian Barwick, unveiled the governing body's four-year strategy for the \"national game\", produced after consulting the army of people playing and organising football throughout the country. They delivered painful truths to the suits of Soho Square who, admirably, have accepted the criticisms and pledged to improve things. Coaching is part of it; led by Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's technical director, a series of courses has been developed to educate coaches in the skills required for different age groups, separating out 5-11 year-olds, 12-16s, then 17-21s. Many adults have been alarmed at the move to professionalise kids so young, but Brooking is adamant that at 5-11 they will not pile on the pressure. \"The accent is on making the game fun, not on results,\" he maintains. \"The coaches are trained to understand children's development, there is no barking or hollering, and the children are encouraged to learn the basic skills - controlling the ball, receiving it side-on, playing with both feet, and so on.\" The strategy pledges to invest \u00a3200m on coaching, recruiting referees and strengthening grassroots organisation, including 66 full-time coaches to train one million 5-11-year-olds nationwide, a scheme sponsored by Tesco. The FA is also promising that every youth team will have at least one qualified coach. Yet this ambition, to improve the game for everybody and ultimately the national team, will be projected on to a blighted landscape which encapsulates a more profound contradiction. More than 15 years since billions of pounds of TV and commercial riches began to pour into football, the FA itself describes the facilities on which the vast majority of people play the game as \"poor, and in some cases, awful\". While Premier League players' wages are up to \u00a3130,000 a week, most public playing fields remain dire, dismal places. Participation in 11-a-side football has fallen and \"thousands\" drop out of playing after the age of 16. In 2000, the Premier League was persuaded to distribute 5% of its TV bonanza - only the domestic part of it - to public football facilities, and the Football Foundation was set up to distribute that money. Matched by the FA and government, and with further cash levered in, since its launch the foundation has funded \u00a3432m of major improvements to 1,089 facilities. The fruits of that redistribution can be seen in good floodlit and artificial pitches popping up around the country, tangible public benefits from the elite game's massive windfall. Yet there is, as politicians might say, much still to do. The FA calculated in 2000 that \u00a32.2bn was required to repair decades of neglect to public playing fields. Now, having developed a vision for high-quality, European-style sports villages which might actually attract people, the FA estimates the country needs upwards of \u00a35bn. Wormwood Scrubs, Hackney Marshes and their windswept equivalents in other cities have mostly not been touched. \"That, sadly, is the state of facilities here,\" laments Nigel Hargreaves, the FA's head of strategic development. \"Significant money has been spent via the foundation but we are scratching the surface, and need to invest a lot more.\" Hargreaves' research has yielded fascinating, if depressing findings. London and the major cities, considered hotbeds of football, have in fact the worst facilities and the fewest people playing the game. London has 16% of England's population but 3% of the football facilities. More football is actually played in small towns and rural areas such as Cambridgeshire and Dorset, where facilities are less run-down, people live closer to them, and there is a readier cadre of volunteers with the wherewithal to organise clubs. The gap between the fortunes in top-level sport and the haggard public landscape represents a huge challenge to the government - these are, after all, publicly owned playing fields and sports centres, which have been left to decline for years. The 2012 Olympics are intended to inspire young people to play sport, yet will create almost no new public sports facilities, even in London. For the same cost as the Olympics, the government could have transformed the sports experience nationwide. There are, too, serious questions for football. The FA promises that the foundation will invest a further \u00a3300m over the next four years. Good news, yet still just a fraction of the Premier League's \u00a32.7bn TV deal from 2007-10, and the FA's \u00a3570m TV revenue between next season and 2012. Of its deal, the Premier League distributes just \u00a315m a year to the foundation: 1.6%. The league emphasises its commitment to this, and points to its other distributions: \u00a35m to its own clubs for community work, \u00a318m to the Professional Footballers' Association, \u00a330m in \"solidarity payments\" to the Football League, which with other projects amounts to \u00a381m a year - 9% of its TV deal. So, just 20 clubs swallow 91% of the wealth, paying much of it in wages to players. Many of those are world stars, and they, and the top clubs' success, generate the following which prompts the cheques from broadcasters. Still, the FA's strategy itself poses a stark question about the balance the game has struck. The chasm between the gilded lives of the Premier League clubs and their millionaire players, and the benighted parks in the deprived neighbourhoods around the grounds, remains English football's greatest contradiction of all. david.conn@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
