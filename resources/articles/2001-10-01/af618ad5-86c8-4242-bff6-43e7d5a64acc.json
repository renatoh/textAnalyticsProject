Two games and two defeats down the line with Derby leave the side which the former Bolton manager inherited from Jim Smith third bottom of the Premiership. Todd did not get off to the best start as Derby's new manager as he watched his side lose 5-2 to Fulham in the Worthington Cup last Wednesay. County were ahead twice but that should not cloud the truth of that game: Derby were outplayed and only a series of outstanding saves from Andy Oakes prevented Fulham reaching double figures. Because of an injury crisis among his goalkeepers, Todd was forced to play Ian Feuer last night. The giant American signed on loan from Wimbledon only last Friday and immediately had to pick up where Oakes left off. Tottenham's start was typically storming and only a series of flying saves prevented them disappearing from sight before half-time. On seven minutes Feuer flicked over a rasping effort from Christian Ziege, then seconds later did even better to block a Les Ferdinand shot. The rebound was scrambled into the net but the \"goal\" was disallowed for offside. But two minutes later Spurs' irresistable attacking play earned its reward as the home side took the lead. Ledley King, up from the back, produced a surging run and shot which a defender blocked. The ball broke to Christian Ziege on the left and his fierce low cross found Ferdinand unmarked on the far post. But as Derby showed at Fulham, they are capable of scoring goals out of the blue and they equalised within two minutes. Fabrizio Ravenelli had already gone close when he was fed by Deon Burton. King seemed to have him covered but the crafty Italian somehow managed to stretch his legs round the defender and, grounded, hooked the ball into the opposite corner. But Spurs came back. Feuer saved from Sheringham, Ziege and Ferdinand while Gus Poyet hit the top of the bar with a header. Eventually Spurs did find the net. Five minutes from the break, Sheringham played a fantastic ball inside the full-back to Ziege, whose goalbound flick beat Feuer's dash from his line. Tottenham's priority as they emerged for the second half was to score a third goal, to give them a cushion should another defensive lapse allow Derby back into the game. They cranked up the pressure from the start and Derby gave away corners and free-kicks in abundance. From one, about 20 yards out, Sheringham curled the ball round the wall but just wide of the post. Then on 61 minutes the veteran England player was put through on goal by Ferdinand's long, precise pass only for Yaoul Mawene to intervene as the striker was about to shoot. Chris Riggott denied Mauricio Taricco with another last gasp tackle and though Todd brought on Georgi Kinkladze in an attempt to put some pressure on Spurs, it was more about how long Derby could resist it at the other end. Resist they did until the final minute when Poyet's audacious 30-yard lob caught Feuer off his line. Tottenham (3-5-2): Sullivan; Perry, Richards, King; Taricco, Anderton, Poyet, Freund, Ziege; Sheringham, Ferdinand (Rebrov, 87). Derby (3-5-2): Feuer; Mawene, Riggott, Higginbotham; Valakari, Murray, Burley, Powell, Johnson; Ravanelli, Burton.
