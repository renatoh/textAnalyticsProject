The hasty enforcement action against a political group was unusual for Facebook and raised questions about the consistency and transparency of the company\u2019s content moderation. The group, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d, was established by a rightwing not-for-profit group, Women for America First, and run by a team of moderators and administrators that included the longtime Tea Party activist Amy Kremer. Members were encouraged to provide their email addresses to a website calling for \u201cboots on the ground to protect the integrity of the vote\u201d, as well as to donate money. The group exploded in popularity on Wednesday and Thursday, racking up more than 730,000 interactions, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics platform. Many of the most popular posts in the group were calls for prayer for Donald Trump, but the group was also rife with misinformation about the election and processes for counting ballots. Two of the group\u2019s moderators, Jennifer Lawrence and Dustin Stockton, are connected to the \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d campaign, for which former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was indicted for fraud, the Daily Beast reported. \u201cIn line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group \u2018Stop the Steal,\u2019 which was creating real-world events,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.\u201d The group was promoting about a dozen \u201cStop the Steal\u201d Facebook events in cities around the US; some but not all of those event pages have been taken down. Sites where ballot counting continues have become targets for a handful of protests as the process drags on \u2013 and the president encourages conspiracy theories about the normal process of counting votes. Trump supporters chanting \u201cstop the count\u201d converged at an election center in Detroit on Wednesday afternoon, while Trump backers in Phoenix, some reportedly armed, gathered at an election site to urge more counting. One protester in Detroit told the Guardian he was responding to a call to action posted by a Facebook page \u201cStand Up Michigan\u201d that formed to protest against Covid lockdowns. Facebook subsequently removed the page, and a related group, \u201cbased on the potential risk for offline harm\u201d, a spokesperson said. Soon after the Stop the Steal group was removed by Facebook, new groups with similar names began rapidly attracting members. Many stated their intention to go \u201cprivate\u201d to evade Facebook\u2019s censors or urged followers to migrate to other social media platforms, including the rightwing Parler or MeWe. Facebook\u2019s hasty action on the Stop the Steal group stands in marked contrast to its handling of other domestic groups that have organized on its platform. The company dragged its heels for months before taking action against the anti-government \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement, which has been linked to multiple murders, and against the antisemitic conspiracy theory QAnon, which has also been linked to violence and identified as a potential domestic terrorism threat. The inconsistency and lack of transparency around Facebook\u2019s approach to content moderation drew quick criticism from experts in the field and digital rights advocates. \u201cIt really matters that platforms should be as clear in advance about their policies and consistent in their application,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, a lecturer at Harvard law school who studies online speech regulation. \u201cThat helps fend off charges that any decisions are politically motivated or biased, and gives us a lever to pull for accountability that isn\u2019t purely about who can get the most public attention or generate public outrage.\u201d Evan Green, the deputy director of Fight for the Future, raised concerns about Facebook setting \u201can extremely dangerous precedent\u201d. \u201cAre people not allowed to form a group on Facebook to discuss if they truly believe their government is engaged in electoral misconduct?\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHow does this play out globally?\u201d Facebook did not immediately respond to queries from the Guardian, including whether the group would have met the threshold for a takedown under normal circumstances, apart from \u201cthis period of heightened tension\u201d, and the nature or volume of calls for violence. The company also declined to provide data or statistics about the scale of content takedowns since Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what accounts have been deleted; we don\u2019t know what hashtags or videos have been taken down,\u201d said Joan Donovan, the research director at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \u201cAll we know collectively as researchers, journalists and civil society is what we\u2019ve caught ourselves. Labeling the president\u2019s tweets \u2013 that\u2019s something everyone can see. But if we\u2019re talking about paramilitary organizing around claims of election fraud, we need to know if Facebook is seeing that.\u201d She added: \u201cThere should be an hour-by-hour update from every one of these platforms about every action taken related to election misinformation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
