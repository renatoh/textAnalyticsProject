The centre\u2019s director, Dr Amanda Laugesen, said the word was chosen from a list of prominent terms because it had become central to public debate in 2019. \u201cFrom our list we like to choose a term that is distinctively Australian,\u201d Laugesen said. \u201c \u2018Voice\u2019 was the frontrunner.\u201d The shortlist included \u201cquiet Australians\u201d, a term coined by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, during the 2019 federal election to refer to a Coalition-voting silent majority, implicitly opposite to the \u201cshouty\u201d progressive elite. It was defined as: \u201cThose Australians regarded as holding moderate opinions but who are not likely to express them publicly.\u201d Also on the list was \u201cfish kill\u201d, as in the Menindee fish kills which saw thousands of native fish turn belly-up in the Murray River, defined as \u201cthe sudden death of a large number of fish in a single event\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cClimate emergency\u201d, which was the Oxford Dictionaries word of the year, and \u201cinfluencer\u201d, as in social media influencer, rounded out the list. The Collins Dictionary word of the year was \u201cclimate strike\u201d. The proposal for a voice came out of the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart, the product of extensive consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the concept of constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. The Uluru statement proposed a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament and a Makarrata commission, to conduct a national truth and reconciliation process to create a path towards a treaty. The proposal of a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament was swiftly dismissed by the Coalition and repeatedly incorrectly described as a third chamber of parliament. Last month the indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, announced a group of 19 advisers, established to design an \u201cIndigenous voice to government\u201d as a compromise option. Thomas Mayor was a delegate at the Uluru summit and has become a prominent campaigner for the voice to parliament, travelling around Australia with the signed canvas Uluru statement and writing a book about his experiences. He said the word selection was encouraging. \u201cIt indicates that our campaign is making a difference,\u201d Mayor told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe have been saying the same thing since Uluru, since the 1930s, since colonisation: First Nations people have been trying to have a say in the places that have been making decisions about them.\u201d Mayor said he was \u201cdismayed and disgusted\u201d by the government\u2019s response to the campaign, but said it had solidified the need for an independent, representative body that is enshrined in the constitution and \u201ccannot be undone by the whims of the parliament\u201d. The ANU Dictionary Centre is jointly funded with Oxford University Press, and informs the Australian editions of the Oxford English Dictionary. The Macquarie Dictionary will announce its people\u2019s choice word of the year on Tuesday. The committee\u2019s choice was \u201ccancel culture\u201d, followed by \u201ceco-anxiety\u201d, the Pitjantjatjara word \u201cngangkari\u201d, meaning healer, and \u201cthicc\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
