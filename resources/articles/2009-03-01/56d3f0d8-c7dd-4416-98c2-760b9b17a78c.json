Investors took fright after the owner of Norwich Union recorded a loss before tax of \u00a31.3bn last year fuelling fears that the insurance industry was poised to become the next victim of the financial crisis. The company's shares dived by a third to 189p, while Prudential also tumbled by 18%, Friends Provident lost 15% and Legal &amp; General fell 14%. That sent Wall Street stocks plunging to their lowest level for nearly 12 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 281 points at 6,594 \u2013 its worst level since April 1997. Banking shares plummeted after the credit agency Moody's said it was considering cutting its ratings on JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Among the worst hit was Citigroup, once the world's most valuable bank, which saw its shares fall 10%, dropping below $1 at one point before closing at $1.02. Until recently, stocks priced at less than a dollar were ejected from the New York stock exchange, although the big board has relaxed this rule in the light of market turmoil. But Citigroup, which has received $45bn of emergency government aid, could face the humiliation of losing its position in the blue-chip Dow Jones index. A Dow Jones spokesman said the inclusion committee was \"watching the situation closely\". Market analysts said US stocks were depressed by warnings from General Motors' auditor of substantial doubt over the carmaker's viability. There were also nerves ahead of US unemployment figures due on Friday which are expected to show a jobless rate approaching 8%. On the economic front, there was disappointment on global markets over indications from Beijing that the Chinese government will not raise its economic stimulus package. There was little sign of relief in the US property market, widely viewed as a key catalyst for the global economic crisis. A record one in eight homeowners ended 2008 behind on loans, according to figures from the US Mortgage Bankers Association. Andrew Moss, Aviva's chief executive, said the company was in good shape to weather the downturn with operating profits up 4% to \u00a32.3bn. He insisted that its capital position remained robust and its balance sheet was able to cope with a deep recession without any extra capital. He dismissed suggestions that a \u00a3500m dividend payment would eat into the capital. He also countered suggestions that a deterioration in world markets since the company's December year end had made the situation worse. \"In a tumultuous year, our underlying business has shown great resilience. Operating profits are up and we have maintained our dividend. \"Aviva remains financially strong. We've undertaken a thorough review of the value of our assets and liabilities, and have made cautious provision for future losses so that we are in good shape to withstand the ongoing volatility and uncertainty in world markets. Maintaining our capital strength has been a priority for us and remains so this year.\" Many investors focused attention on \u00a32.9bn of unrealised losses in the US that would wipe out any capital surplus. Broker Bernstein said the picture was unduly negative. \"The math is seductive, as the post-tax cost of the unrealised losses will roughly match the surplus. The issue is, will those losses be realised and when? Full loss realisation implies that about 30% of investment grade companies go bust in the next five years \u2014 an absurd prospect, or at least one that it is not in the general market prices.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
