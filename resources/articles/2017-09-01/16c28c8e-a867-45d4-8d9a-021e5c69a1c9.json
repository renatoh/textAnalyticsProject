In the lead-up to his first Emporio Armani show in London for a decade, at a warehouse in the East End on Sunday, he has beamed his logo across County Hall. He has installed a retinue of a hundred or so global employees on a floor of his Mayfair headquarters. All of a sudden, all of the taxis and buses in W1 are covered in his branding. London is important to Armani. \u201cIt is probably the only true city where you see the creative turmoil,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can feel, you can sense it. \u201cParis is very romantic, because the people who actually manage the city want it to stay the same. But London is truly modern.\u201d He came here in the 1970s, when he first set up his label. \u201cCarnaby Street was a huge source of inspiration. Like everyone else, I found it to be a magical moment for the place and time. But then I distilled that and tried to adapt it following my own vision.\u201d The fashion industry, which is comfortable with hyperbole, describes Armani as the king, even the god, of style. He is certainly the living designer who \u2013 like Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent before him \u2013 has most profoundly changed the way we all dress. Over 42 years his business has mushroomed into a sprawling empire with several different clothing lines as well as hotels, real estate, beauty, watches, chocolates, interiors and eyewear. According to Forbes, he is worth $8.6bn. Meeting him is quite an experience. We are in a large room at Armani HQ, surrounded by rack upon rack of clothes and half a dozen trestle tables covered in hundreds of accessories and handbags. Armani is being photographed against the black velvet backdrop strictly stipulated by his team in advance. His suited advisers hover around the photographer, proffering advice about camera angles. I am ushered over to shake his hand, which Armani keeps holding as he leaps up and guides me into a private sideroom. There he sits on a grey bucket chair, with one leg curled up on the seat. He is wearing a navy blue cashmere jumper, navy blue trousers and bright white trainers with little white trainer socks. The designer owes his age-defying bicep definition, he says, to an hour and a half in the gym every morning. \u201cI am very careful with what I eat. That\u2019s why restaurants are not too easy. Because I am very picky.\u201d This would be a cosy set-up, were it not for the three men in Armani suits who sit with us. One of them translates (Armani does not do interviews in English, although, after decades of dressing the likes of Richard Gere and Cate Blanchett, he must speak a bit of it). Another is Armani\u2019s English PR. The third \u2013 the most sharply dressed of the three, with dark, Brylcreemed hair \u2013 I am never introduced to. Armani is enjoyably grumpy on a number of topics. He is a \u201csimpatico\u201d boss, but \u201cwhen I do realise that things are not going as I planned, the people who work for me, they will know. It will be painful for them to realise.\u201d He loves London\u2019s buzz and the history of the city, but not \u201cthe level of service, the attention to detail in places like restaurants, where the men are always just wearing a shirt. \u201cI would have expected more. Businessmen, just wearing a shirt in a restaurant? That\u2019s not right.\u201d A lot of fashion now is novelty for novelty\u2019s sake. \u201cThere are still some things I love to see young people wear. And others I profoundly detest. You need respect,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cEven what you wear, presenting yourself in front of people, you should show respect through that.\u201d He gives a delightfully backhanded compliment to Gucci and other labels that favour a trend-led approach. \u201cI think it\u2019s right for them to try new things, to be daring, to experiment, because for those brands it would be very risky not to. The real challenge is to be a creative designer but still be true to your own style, without stealing ideas from your colleagues, your friends, people you meet.\u201d Armani\u2019s London extravaganza is part of a reorganisation of the company, which last year concentrated seven design lines into three after a 5% dip in revenue. The restructuring should, he says, \u201cproduce a lot more clarity in the eyes of the final consumer\u201d. This relaunch includes the \u201creopening\u201d of Emporio Armani\u2019s flagship store on Bond Street. \u201cAs I bought the business back,\u201d he says, \u201cI had to rethink the whole way the country and the market was managed.\u201d How does he manage such a huge portfolio in such detail? Why doesn\u2019t he just hang out on his yacht? \u201cThe true answer,\u201d he says, \u201cis I don\u2019t know. A lot of people my age are playing with their grandchildren or with a dog. I have 10,000 people in my company who are waiting for my guidance, for my leadership, to know what they are supposed to do. I can\u2019t do it any other way. That\u2019s why I have to do it.\u201d In 2003, when Armani was a lad of 69, he said: \u201cIt would be ridiculous for a designer to still be in place at 85\u201d. He is now 83, and his succession plan \u2013 the establishment of a Giorgio Armani Foundation \u2013 was announced only recently. The foundation, he says, was the best plan to ensure this \u201cvery rich, very liquid\u201d company will continue, and will invest in charity and culture appropriately. I didn\u2019t want to just leave it on the shoulders of my heirs, this big task which is also a bit of a burden,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to designate the people who would do it.\u201d Does he have any ambitions? \u201cI\u2019ve done it all,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve done so many things and all of these things have stolen a bit of my life away, in a way.\u201d A few times, invisible cues pass between the suited men around me, and then I am asked to wrap up the interview, though Armani, sitting opposite me, fixing me with his steely gaze, has never perceptibly expressed a wish for the interview to be terminated. Eventually I let him go, knowing that he must have given the signal. He is always in charge, after all. \u201cThe puppeteer is me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s quite a burden, actually.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
