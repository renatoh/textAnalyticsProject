Wasn't the notorious Nazi prison a famously difficult place to meet girls?\" Well, thankfully, they'd thought of all that. What happens is an escapee from a different Nazi prison, Lt Nick McGrade (Damian Lewis, here deploying a Glaswegian accent) returns to London, looks up the girlfriend of his less fortunate accomplice, Lt Jack Rose (Tom Hardy) - who has in the meantime been recaptured and sent to Colditz - and decides he wants her for himself. In his new capacity as an agent working for MI9, McGrade sends the girl (Sophia Myles, with very good hair) a false letter, telling her that her boyfriend has been shot and killed. Less than cricket, I know. That was Sunday. If you missed any of that, I would imagine you found last night's big finish a trifle confusing. On the one hand you have the drama back at Colditz: one doomed escape attempt following another, all with a fair eye for historical accuracy, although I kept waiting for them to start building the plane in the attic. Then there is the romance in London between Lizzie and McGrade, with the former resisting the advances of the latter. If you saw Sunday's trailer you already knew they were going to have sex, which made her continued standoffishness seem a bit calculating. What's she holding out for? Stockings? The two strands reconnect when escapees from Colditz start pitching up in London, posing a potential threat to McGrade's version of events. One of them, Sawyer, becomes suspicious of McGrade and writes to Jack Rose to ask him if he's dead or not. Jack, thus alerted to McGrade's machinations, jumps the escape queue (they're very organised at Colditz) and makes his way to France. McGrade kills Sawyer and tries to stop Jack making it back to Blighty by telling the Nazis where he's hiding. Then he proposes to Lizzie. When Jack gives the Nazis the slip, McGrade puts on his demob suit and grabs a revolver. By this time I'm thinking that no one is ever going to get round to building the plane. You had to keep your eye on Colditz or it threatened to get up and run off without you, but careful study was rewarded. Timothy West was brilliant, if fleeting, as the old boffin who makes walnuts with compasses in to send off in the Colditz care packages, and Jason Priestly - formerly of Beverly Hills 90210 - turned up as the absolute last man you'd want on your prison-escape committee: a heroin addict dependent on the Nazi guards for his fix. And Canadian with it. \"IKEA is a day experience,\" said a marketing expert. \"I'm sure there are some people who say, 'Shall we go to Alton Towers, or shall we go to the zoo, or shall we go to IKEA?'\" Given those options, I'd probably choose Colditz. IKEA Drives Me Crazy (BBC2) was a quirky little piece revolving around presenter Nicky Taylor's attempt to procure and assemble an IKEA bed for her son, and shot through with archive footage and commentary from designers, \"IKEAholics\", psychiatrists, freelance malcontents, a housewife rapper (don't ask) and the Guardian's very own Oliver Burkeman. The debate would be familiar to anyone who has ever been to a dinner party. Are IKEA products design classics or cheap rubbish? Has it replaced church as our preferred form of Sunday worship? Does it have a political agenda, a mission to remake the planet in the image of Sweden's classless society? Or is it just a big shop? The malcontents were more fun than the fans, dismissing IKEA as \"I Queue Here\" and tutting over the famous IKEA riot which broke out at the midnight grand opening of the Edmonton branch in north London last year. \"There's such a thing as dignity,\" said one expert, shaking his head. The malcontents are, however, firmly in the minority. Every year, 365 million people shop at IKEA. In fact IKEA has become such a universal experience that this programme was like having an argument with yourself, an argument that ultimately boils down to a simple choice: a complete waste of a Saturday versus some really cheap shelving. And for all IKEA's seductive power, you are the one who makes the decision. \"Ultimately it's your fault if you're a grown up, and only your fault,\" said one wise head. They should put that above the door of IKEA. I wonder what it sounds like in Swedish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
