So here's the full text of those we chose from. People were very exercised about Phorm and the prospects of small Linux laptops... Click through for the full text. FUTURE PHORM Up in arms is an understatement,I have already been in touch with my MP about the proposed introduction of Phorm by my ISP. Will wait to see if he even knows what i am talking about. I will stop my contract with ISP and stop buying the GUARDIAN newspaper which has also signed up to Phorm. As a campaigning ethical newspaper (like free data) how could you use such a company with such an unethical background. Use your campaigning clout NOW to stop this happening. Anthony Coulson, Brixham As a matter of interest (being a shareholder) , surely the only people who will be complaining is the techy-savy IT guys? I use google, msn, yahoo and even though I know these companies store my search habits for a year - and here's Phorm WITh an opt out button (where does Google offer me the opt out?) anonymising my data, and the techy world is up in arms! Wayne Grossman, Shenely Thank you for letting me know that The Guardian has signed up to use the collected data from Phorm. Charles Arthur's article was very good, though it will be the last article I'll be reading from The Guardian. I've removed the site from my favourites and won't be buying your paper anymore. Phorm is an extremely bad idea, being implemented by a very dubious company. Gareth (no post town given) Your article about Phorm in today's technology section was both interesting and worrying. Thank you for highlighting this potential abuse. Could you follow up with suggestions covering who in the ISPs you listed to contact to ensure that my web traffic is not tracked this way, and techniques for frustrating this activity if the ISP proceed regardless, such as client software to disable it, or use of proxies etc. Paul Dearing, London Thank you very much covering the Phorm issue currently being discussed on the internet. I found the article very useful, especially as I am one of the customers of the big three ISPs you have mentioned. Keep up the good work, Paul Taylor, Bristol &gt;&gt; The adult site operators, the pill merchants, the casinos: they will always be trying to advertise on this new service. Unless your life is completely clean, you could be in for a bad surprise when these adverts appear unexpectedly. A similar problem occurs with adverts that are permissible but only just. Are adverts for condoms permitted, for example? Arguably adverts for condoms are a public service because they encourage people to use protection \u2014 but you still don't want them to appear when you're showing someone an article from the Guardian. Why can't ISPs just do the job they are paid to do? theblog.org.uk &gt;&gt; I know that Google collects data on our search histories. I can at least rationalise that by thinking \"it is a free service that I don't have to use\". But the ISPs are taking money for a service that they are changing without notice in ways that I don't want them to and which are ethically, if not legally, dodgy. There are those that argue that Britain is a heavily spied upon society anyway (the highest density of public surveillance cameras, for instance), but that doesn't mean that we should accept each new intrusion without some protest. auspiciousdragon.net/57north &gt;&gt; OK. Not happy. At all. Thanks, Virgin Fuckers. Currently researching methods to stop this... jboutandabout.livejournal.com THINK... NUCLEAR? Nuclear, at its very best industry guestimates, could only possibly save 4% of UK CO2 emissions and at the cost of research and development of energy efficiency and renewables. This, however, totally ignores any determination to effect energy related emissions from the demand side. Reducing demand directly, or by improving efficiency of energy use, has the potential to make very significant contributions to climate change targets. The other benefit of this aspect of energy policy, is that demand reduction and energy efficiency would financially benefit a vast number of individuals, whereas any nuclear program would only provide major real benefit to executives of energy companies and at great cost (for evermore) to the taxpayer. Charlie Graham, Green Party In his article, Charles Arthur advocates \"going totally nuclear\" because \"renewables - wind, wave, sun - cannot ever meet our growing electricity demand\". However, tidal power can do this. In 1966, the Sustainable Development Commission reported to the government that there is no justification for a new nuclear programme because only four or five tidal power schemes can replace all of our nuclear power stations. It would be irresponsible to adopt nuclear power when there is not yet any suitable means of disposing of its radioactive waste and an alternative is available. Tidal power needs no new technology to be invented. The tidal barrage at La Rance in Frane has been generating for 40 years. A scheme for a Severn barrage was proposed 50 years ago and an updated scheme is under consideration by the government. If the government was seriously concerned about climate change, it would already be building the Severn Barage and starting to plan the next! John Flood, Solihull Hah. So you thought you'd get away with it in Technology Guardian - that the assorted propellor-heads and anoraks wouldn't get disentangled in time to challenge your 'opinion'? A room full of carbon dioxide is no more deadly than a room full of water - the result would be suffocation if you were left in there. The effect of a roomful of carbon dioxide on the climate would be truly negligible. I believe that you are incorrect when you say nuclear fuel is plentiful - the last figure I heard was 70 years supply at current rates of usage. And when that runs out what else is there? Yes, we are facing a crisis in that the byproducts of energy production pollute the environment, the answer is to consume less and the way to achieve that is for the human race to stop breeding at its present rate. You will be aware that the Government Scientist has realised what Malthus was telling us about 200 years ago - we're running out of stuff and lack of food will kill us quicker than climate change or radioactivity. Ken Grayling, Tharston An excellent article by Charles Arthur. Has anyone ever done a serious engineering investigation into whether it would be possible to provide enough electrical power from so-called 'renewables? Geof Davey, St.Albans At last someone sensible enough to point out that CO2 is just as \"deadly\" and \"toxic\" as nuclear waste (last week, Charles Arthur). But why stop there ? Surely wind turbines are equally life-threatening, if you climb up and get minced by the blades. And water can kill you if you drink too much AND if you drown in it, so tidal energy is actually twice as deadly as nuclear. In fact, drinking sea water can also send you mad - surely the only rational explanation for environmentalists' blind opposition to a nuclear tomorrow. Simon Gulliver, Hove To suggest that if plastic bags cease to be used naphtha will be burnt as a waste product of oil refining is nonsense. Manufacture of plastic bags is only one of a wide range of outlets for polyethylene and polyethylene is only one of a large number of chemicals and plastics produced from naphtha; polypropylene, nylon, PVC,polystyrene, polyester fibre, synthetic rubbers are among familiar examples. In any case naphtha which is not used in chemical manufacture is put through a process (catalytic reforming) which transforms it into material suitable for use as a component of petrol. Peter Wiseman, High Peak Now I know Wikipedia is not necessarily the font of all knowledge but they list about a dozen uses of naphtha. This is also a claim made by the industry body, the Carrier Bag Consortium. Can you clear this up for us? Is there really no other use for naphtha? David (no post town given) Imagine the Romans had discovered a long-lasting poison which rendered parts of England uninhabitable even today. Now imagine a civilisation existed 10,000 years before the Romans, much more advanced than our own, leaving only traces today. But they used a mysterious and lethal technology which today means certain areas of the planet make you ill, but no-one understands why. That is the legacy we are leaving with nuclear waste. Charles Arthur says nuclear waste disposal has to be done \"for the long term\" but is \"well understood\". Yes, we understand it, but I can assure you that in 10,000 years they won't. William Thomas, Dartington It is not necessary to cease manufacturing plastic bags as they do perform a useful role and, as you state, they use a material which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Genuine plastic bags which are biodegradeable/compostable and meet both the EU and American requirements are available and thus be perfectly acceptable. Rob Golding, Plastic Free Farnham Campaign. I can give you half a dozen reasons why it would be wrong or downright nuts for Gordon Brown to announce a programe to source all our electricity from nuclear by 2020. They are well known, and if you want one reference, nearly all were raised in some form in the comments one the Government consultation on nuclear power (and duly ignored). But you are the journalist, paid to research and summarise this sort of thing, and you have good Guardian journalists (e.g. George Monbiot) to help screw your head on right, so why should I give you my time to do your job? So were you just flying a kite or too lazy to think it through? Either way, you insult your newspaper's readership - get thee to the Daily Mail, where as you rightly point out, half-brained ideas have a ready take-up among a half-brained readership and ditto politicians. (Now just imagine the DM had said 'Don't buy cars more than 140g/km CO2 and don't drive at more than 60 mph; really useful ideas which would have gone down like a lead balloon with its readership ....). However, 'no use for the naptha' is also one of the least reasons I can think of to oppose the plastic bags initiative. Again, if you talk to the oil folk, I think you will find that they can either reform it to make lots of saleable things or at least burn it for their own energy needs. And most of us are quite capable of doing as the older ones always did in the past, taking a reusable bag shopping with us and thereby cutting out one piece of consumerist candy-floss which goes on the grocery bill one way or another. (But don't call it that in the DM - too near home!) Looking forward to some better journalism from you in the future. George Sudbury, Winchester &gt;&gt; The piece is quite well argued and I find it difficult to disagree with the author. But, I'm staggered to see that it's in The Guardian, a bastion of the anti-nuclear lobby! It's a good job that it is not on CIF, there would be the most horrendous set of ranting posts building up already! junkk.blogspot.com MICROSOFT VS FLASH Glyn Moody ends his article about the Asus Eee and similar machines by saying 'It seems that the only way Microsoft can hope to get people using its software on this new class of low-cost, ultraportable machines is by going fully open source itself'. The two people I know with an Asus have both foregone the Linux that came with it and installed Windows XP. John Stout, Ormskirk Glynn Moody spoils an otherwise interesting article by stating that you need 8GB to run Windows XP. WRONG. You can buy an Asus eee 4GB with Windows XP and the useful bits of Office pre-loaded in places like Bangkok. Cost about \u00a3200, and works perfectly. This and the other software including Foxit to read PDFs and an adequate antivirus programme (NOD32) take up about half the 4GB, leaving nearly 2 GB for files and folders. Add 4GB cards to the 3 USB 2.0 ports and SD slot (total cost less than \u00a340 from Amazon) and this effectively makes the eee an 18GB machine - more than enough for 95% of users. You can also easily add programmes via a USB CD ROM, and store your photos on an external hard drive at home. And with flash memory there's no tiny, spinning, hard disk to fail. I'll never buy a conventional laptop again. John Kanefsky, Morchard Bishop &gt;&gt; On a global basis FOSS is being openly adopted by Second and Third world economies for the very reason that they cannot afford First world solutions. Whole generations of children will grow up first learning Linux not WinXP thanks to the One Laptop Per Child laptop effort. So for Microsoft the world is going to become a dwindling world of opportunity. tightwadtechnica.com &gt;&gt; I played a little with an Asus Eee a few weeks ago. The keyboard is small and the screen isn't up to contemporary standards -- but I still like it -- a lot of bang for the buck. You can get this fully functional \"laptop\" for about $300. I'm predicting that they'll gain a cult following similar to what happened with the Palms when they first came out. bradboydston.blogspot.com &gt;&gt; If I was in the marked for a commercial computer \"that just works\" I would go for the Apple of the ASUS because I cannot touch type on mini machines. But most of my machines are desktops, and half of my work is interacting with other systems. Vista is not OS X \u2014 the beautiful OS you can create things on. WIndows is now the basis of silos: medical databases, clinical trials tracking software\u2026 or is it? pukeko.net.nz &gt;&gt; Perhaps Microsoft can learn a lesson from history and Sun Microsystems. The lesson is not to wait. If Sun had open sourced Solaris and enabled its adoption on other architectures sooner it may have prevented the rise of Linux. Unfortunately for Microsoft it may be too little too late and the reality is that monopolies can't last forever. linux-foundation.org/weblogs/jzemlin TINYURLS (AT LENGTH) Last week's letters page rather mockingly featured a long url from BT, and that tinyurls might be preferable, subsequently supplied by Tech.Ed. Indeed the Tech section, such as in Ask Jack, makes a lot of use of tinyurls as it is. I would argue the opposite. A real url carries information of itself - tinyurls don't. It's much easier just to remember the basic URL and maybe the folder of a real URL, than the cryptic tinyurl. So, in the case of the BT, you just have to know that you go to products and services, and then to what's related to consumer products. I agree the BT site could be clearer, usually the easily remembered basic URL would do, so you can just click through from there. It would be nice if Ask Jack and other sections could give such basic URL information, perhaps to the first folder level, along with any tinyurls. Real URLs can also show what background company is involved, that the reader may be familiar with. Paul Bracciano, Belfast [This still misses the fundamental point: tinyurls are the most efficient use of space in print, which is where we use them, because they use only 18 characters - Tech. Ed] REVIVING THE DOCTOR &gt;&gt; this has cheered me up no end for its simplicity. There isn't a negative point in here about slumping ratings, falling share prices, BBC deception or phone line fraud. No, this story means I might finally be able to watch Doctor Who and the Mind of Evil in glorious colour, and that's a nice thing. How often do we get to say that these days? thestage.co.uk/tvtoday ESCAPING IT PRISON &gt;&gt; The broader problem, I suspect, is a product of fear and complacency \u2014 yes, there are industries in which regulatory requirements make things more difficult than they might be otherwise. I'm not about to suggest that we allow people at the SIS to send CDs through the post \u2014 but then they're probably smart enough not to do that in the first place. It's mid-size, unregulated organisations which, in a way, frustrate me most \u2014 particularly those with largely professional staff. share.skype.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
