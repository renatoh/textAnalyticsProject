At 13, he was trick-or-treating with friends when word spread through his neighborhood that a madman was firing a gun randomly in the street. The terrified kids scattered to find safety in their homes, but when Flea approached his parents\u2019 house he noticed that all the front windows had been blown out and debris strewn all over the lawn. Once inside, he found his step-father, Walter, with blood smeared over his face and torso, a smoking pistol dangling by his side. \u201cHe was the lunatic they were all talking about,\u201d Flea recalled. \u201cIt was terrifying and shameful.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened. \u201cWalter would get drunk and something would trigger him and he would freak out and smash everything in the house,\u201d Flea said. \u201cAt times, a gun would come out.\u201d After the Halloween incident, the cops came and arrested Walter. After he went through the system and returned home, he apologized to Flea and his mom profusely. \u201cAnd then,\u201d said Flea, \u201cthe pattern would repeat.\u201d Making sense of events like this wound up driving nearly the entire narrative of Flea\u2019s harrowing \u2013 but, at times also, hilarious \u2013 memoir, titled Acid for the Children. It\u2019s overwhelmingly focused on his formative years, broken by short fast-forwards to his time with the Chili Peppers. Some of the Peppers\u2019 vignettes deal with the band\u2019s own traumas, including Flea\u2019s guilt over the heroin-related death of the band\u2019s early guitarist Hillel Slovak at just 26. But the main part of the book ends with their very first live show. Not that this was Flea\u2019s original game plan. \u201cI thought I would just write about the band because who would be arrogant enough to think anyone would care about my childhood?\u201d he said. But, given the amount of violence, drug use and sometimes useful adventure in his past, this clearly wasn\u2019t just any childhood. \u201cEventually, I became entranced with the idea of getting under the narrative, to find out the \u2018why\u2019 of my early life,\u201d he said. To capture the fractured nature of it, Flea divided his book into brief, blunt chapters, in the process creating a rhythm for his prose as curt and distinct as his bass playing. The first part of the story centers on impressionistic perceptions from his first four years of life in Melbourne, Australia, where he was born Michael Peter Balzary. When he was five, his father\u2019s work necessitated the family move to Rye, a northern suburb of New York City. By the time he was seven, Flea\u2019s parents divorced and his father moved back to Australia, causing the boy to feel abandoned and unmoored. Things became even more unstable when his mother remarried to a troubled jazz musician, Walter Urban Jr (now deceased). Immediately, Walter moved the family (including Flea\u2019s older sister, Karyn) to his parents\u2019 house where they lived together in the basement. Though Flea paints his stepfather as an unkempt, odd and violent man, he believes his mother was drawn to his bohemian sensibility. \u201cShe had grown up in this really straight Australia, where things went by the rules of the 1950s,\u201d he said. By contrast, \u201cWalter did drugs and played jazz and had all kinds of ethnicities hanging out. It was a chance for her to go into New York City and liberate herself.\u201d After a few wild years on the east coast, the family relocated to the gnarlier parts of Hollywood and, by 11, a barely supervised Flea began to smoke pot every day. The cover of the book boasts a picture of him at 12 smoking a joint. By that time, Flea had acquired his nickname, based on his fidgety nature and diminutive stature. The latter contributed to an already serious inferiority complex. From early childhood, Flea writes that he had \u201can undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded\u201d. This belief, along with his unstructured home life, led him to yearn for a brotherhood of friends to serve as a surrogate family. Most of the kids he found were fellow scamps who enabled his knack for getting into scrapes, which ranged from petty theft to crashing cars. Drugs became another bond. Flea began shooting speed regularly, which didn\u2019t help his attention deficit disorder tendencies or his emotional advancement. On the other hand, he believes he got a lot out of his experiments with hallucinogens. One chapter begins with the line \u201cLSD was good to me\u201d. \u201cFor someone like me, who was running crazy in the street, the drug got me to access my subconscious, to develop introspection,\u201d he said. Flea admits he overperformed on that front, a tendency exacerbated by his desire to escape the violence at home. At the same time, his stepfather\u2019s role as a serious musician and artist had a positive effect on him, providing a living example of the power and beauty of music. \u201cWhen I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,\u201d he said. The combination of the muscularity of music and Flea\u2019s wild character contributed to his later emphasis on nudity and primitivism in the Chili Peppers\u2019 presentation. \u201cI grew up running around naked,\u201d said Flea. \u201cThere\u2019s a freedom inherent in it, a rebelliousness, that I find beautiful.\u201d The band\u2019s eager display of their bodies gave them a homoerotic frisson from the start. But for Flea there was a serious message behind it, rooted in his past. In a chapter of the book titled Men Don\u2019t Kiss Men he recalls how hurt he felt at the age of six when his birth father admonished him for wanting a kiss. It seeded a will in him to rebel against the restrictive nature of male identity. Early in their career, the Chili Peppers did so in a daring way by posing for the Los Angeles-based gay porn magazine In Touch. \u201cI felt honored that they wanted us in the magazine,\u201d Flea said. \u201cThe gay community in Los Angeles were the first ones to really embrace the Chili Peppers.\u201d In conversation, Flea revealed that he had gay experiences of his own growing up, episodes he wrote about at length in an early version of the book. But, he wound up taking all that out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be sensationalized,\u201d he explained. \u201cTo me, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I was experimenting and it turns out, \u2018hey, I\u2019m not gay\u2019. So, it\u2019s not really my story.\u201d More central to Flea\u2019s story is his deep, and complicated, relationship with the Chili Peppers\u2019 singer, Anthony Kiedis. In the book, he calls Anthony \u201cthe missing link I never considered\u201d. \u201cHe was unlike anyone I had ever met,\u201d Flea said. \u201cAmong my friends, I was the guy who was always trying to do something that would freak people out. Then I met Anthony and he matched me step for step. We got up to all kinds of crazy shit.\u201d In the memoir, Flea expresses an undimmed awe for Anthony but he also calls him controlling. Still, he\u2019s vague on details. Considering that Flea also writes about forever wanting Anthony\u2019s approval, one wonders if he censored his writing to stay on the singer\u2019s good side. Flea admits there\u2019s something to that, but he is willing to discuss one key issue between them. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m different and that things that excite me may not excite him,\u201d Flea said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking to be the alpha.\u201d He also admitted that Anthony\u2019s many years of drug abuse (which the singer wrote about in his own memoir, Scar Tissue, published in 2004) infuriated him. \u201cIt\u2019s painful and scary and sad,\u201d said Flea. \u201cBecause the rationale of someone who\u2019s a drug addict is disingenuous and hollow and misguided.\u201d He said he hasn\u2019t read Anthony\u2019s memoir (\u201cI might feel hurt and I don\u2019t want to walk into a rehearsal room feeling upset about something\u201d). And, he said, Anthony hasn\u2019t read his. As it happens, Flea devoted as much of his book to the band\u2019s late guitarist Slovak, as he did to their living singer. One of the most wrenching sections finds Flea beating himself up over his handling of Slovak\u2019s addiction. \u201cI was so angry at him,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a long time, I kicked myself that I didn\u2019t know how to be there for him in a way that I could have been. It\u2019s a hard thing.\u201d Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. \u201cI went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.\u201d Acid for the Children is released on 5 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
