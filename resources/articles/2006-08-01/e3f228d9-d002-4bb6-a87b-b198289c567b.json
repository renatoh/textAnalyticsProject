Individual lashes are a different prospect entirely. 'The lashes come in three lengths - short for inner lashes, medium for centre, long for outer corners -and they're great for filling in sparse areas,' says Jackie Brader, chief lash technician at Eylure. Remove the selected lash from the tray with tweezers, and dip the knotted end in the adhesive provided. 'Place the lash on top of your own lash, with the knotted end close to your lash line, then work towards the outer corner. Apply seven to 14 lashes per eye.' Apply make-up as usual, but try to avoid too much mascara (and take it off with an oil-based remover). Routinely rub in a little Vaseline to keep the lashes looking healthy. The best thing is, they're water-resistant and last up to four weeks - no fear of hairy cheeks, then. Vaseline, 99p, from Boots nationwide. Precision tweezers, \u00a319.50, by Shavata, 020-8997 1089.
