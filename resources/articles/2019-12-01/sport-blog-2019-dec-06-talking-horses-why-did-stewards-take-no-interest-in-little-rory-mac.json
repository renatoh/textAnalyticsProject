Little Rory Mac was sent off as the 15-8 favourite after opening on course at 13-8 but won like an odds-on shot by an easy seven lengths. That provoked complaints from some who had backed the horse when he last ran, at Warwick last month, when he was settled out the back and ran on to be a never-nearer sixth. Liam Heard received a 10-day suspension from the stewards that day \u201cfor failing to ride his mount in such a way that he could be seen to ask for real or substantial effort to obtain the best possible placing\u201d. In victory at Market Rasen, Little Rory Mac received a more positive ride from Nathan Brennan in what may well have been a weaker race and the difference in outcome was stark. What grates with me is that the Rasen stewards do not appear to have asked a single question about the improvement in form. Certainly there is no evidence of any such questions on the BHA website. I do not say that asking those questions would have led to any further action. I think we\u2019re all familiar by now with the dance; a horse shows improved form, the stewards ask why, the explanations are noted and nothing else happens. But if you don\u2019t even ask the question, you\u2019ve given up hope of running the game as it should be run and you cannot expect to convince others that you are being vigilant. Meanwhile, McCormack had a jolly time through Twitter, suggesting before the race that he might have a small each-way bet and that the horse was too short in the betting at 13-8. After Little Rory Mac\u2019s success, he boasted of winning \u201c30 large\u201d though he also pointed out that he was merely reclaiming what he had lost through other betting activity. He mocked those who complained about the Warwick ride by briefly changing his avatar to a picture of a handbrake. He posted a picture, since deleted, of a large amount of cash he had apparently won. \u201cI understand, as an owner, I shouldn\u2019t be acting that way on social media,\u201d McCormack told me on Friday morning. \u201cBut the stick that I got for the Warwick race \u2013 people were calling me a cheat and all sorts. It was just a bit of fun, what I was doing yesterday, but some people have obviously taken it the wrong way.\u201d McCormack insists he would not have backed Little Rory Mac, had he remained at 13-8 throughout. But, he says, when he could get 2-1 within the last 10 minutes before the race, he decided to bet and it ended up as a big day for him. His view is that the horse responded well to more positive tactics in a weaker race, which the stable had won the previous year. I can\u2019t say I enjoyed his Twitter output on Thursday and I\u2019d prefer followers of racing to be treated with more respect. But it is much more concerning to me that the stewards took no interest. People will stop betting on horse racing if they see it as a lawless world. I\u2019ve asked the British Horseracing Authority for an explanation and will post it on here if I get one. 2.25pm update: BHA response So here\u2019s the BHA reply. Evidently they have a practice of not inquiring about improved form where the jockey has been punished for the previous ride as Heard was in this case. I must say, I don\u2019t like that policy at all. It is one thing to say a jockey has made insufficient effort, it\u2019s quite another to say any amount of improvement is allowed the next time without triggering so much as an inquiry. Anyway, a BHA spokesman said: The horse was subject to a running and riding enquiry on its previous start, where the jockey was given a 10-day suspension for not being seen to ask his mount for a real, timely and substantial effort. It is standard practice not to hold improvement in form inquiries for horses who have been found not to have been ridden on their merits last time out, because the concerns over their previous runs have already been highlighted and suitable action taken. \u201cIn general though, the fact that the stewards haven\u2019t held an enquiry doesn\u2019t mean a matter won\u2019t be investigated further if appropriate to take into account any pertinent information that comes to light subsequently. \u201cIt is not acceptable for anyone bound by the Rules of Racing to act or conduct themselves in a manner that is prejudicial to the good reputation of the sport. In line with usual procedure, however, we wouldn\u2019t comment on specific cases or speculation surrounding potential investigations.\u201d Chris Cook Enrilo set to skip Festival \u201cI thought he was a massive price,\u201d Paul Nicholls said after Enrilo\u2019s success in Grade Two Winter Novice Hurdle at Sandown on Friday, about 10 minutes too late for punters who had abandoned him after an odds-on defeat at Ludlow in November. Those who kept faith with the five-year-old were paid out at 10-1, after a determined success which largely dispelled the fear that Enrilo\u2019s attitude might be a counterweight to his ability. Nicholls has often mentioned Enrilo as one of the brightest prospects in his stable, above all when he starts to jump fences next season. He still has some races in him over hurdles, however, and stayed on well to finish three-quarters of a length in front of House Island, reversing the form of his disappointing run at Ludlow by around 35 lengths in the process. \u201cSomething upset him [at Ludlow] and he got in a bit of a fight with Bryony [Frost],\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cShe literally couldn\u2019t keep him on the course. We don\u2019t know why, maybe he got pinched somewhere or got sore, but I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw that day. \u201cAt the end of the day, whatever we do with him this year, he\u2019ll be a super chaser in a year\u2019s time. He\u2019s well capable of winning a decent race in the spring somewhere, but I won\u2019t ruin him by going to Cheltenham or anything like that as it\u2019s too soon.\u201d Despite Nicholls\u2019s suggestion that Enrilo will bypass Cheltenham, he picked up quotes of around 25-1 for both the Ballymore Novice Hurdle and the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle. Goshen also made a move in the ante-post Festival markets after an easy success at 1-3 in the opening juvenile hurdle. Gary Moore\u2019s three-year-old is the new favourite for the Triumph Hurdle with several firms after crossing the line 34 lengths clear of the runner-up and will attempt to cement his place in the betting for the juvenile championship on Trials Day at Cheltenham in late January.
