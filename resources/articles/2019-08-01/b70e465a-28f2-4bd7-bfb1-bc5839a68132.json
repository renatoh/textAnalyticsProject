In the hours following Michaela Dunn\u2019s death, her name had not been released and her age had been incorrectly reported as 21. \u201cI have a 21-year-old friend who took a while to respond and it was a nervy period,\u201d she says. Dunn, who is actually 24, had been working out of an apartment on Clarence Street in Sydney\u2019s CBD. At about 1.30pm the man suspected of murdering her, 20-year-old Mert Ney, arrived at her building for what police commissioner Mick Fuller called \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d. CCTV showed him leaving the apartment 20 minute later and taking a \u201cselfie\u201d on his phone before embarking on what Fuller described as six minutes of \u201cterrifying carnage\u201d during which he stabbed a 41-year-old woman in the back before being chased and subdued by bystanders. Dunn\u2019s body was discovered an hour later after neighbours heard screaming. In a statement released after her death, New South Wales police were typically dispassionate: \u201cThe 24-year-old woman had sustained a laceration to her neck and was pronounced deceased at the scene\u201d. Her death prompted an outpouring of grief within the sex work community. On the day after her death, other sex workers left flowers and a small teddy bear with a message \u201ctaken too soon\u201d at the front of her apartment. But there was also anger at what friends and colleagues felt was an undue focus on her profession. On social media a sex worker who told media that \u201cviolence and murder is part of our job\u201d was heavily criticised. \u201cHer job does not make her a lurid story,\u201d her friend Joan Westernberg wrote on Twitter. \u201cShe was a person and she is now gone.\u201d The chief executive of the Sex Worker Outreach Program, or Swop, Cameron Cox, told Guardian Australia: \u201cA lot is being made out of the fact [she was] a sex worker but she was a whole person, she wasn\u2019t just a sex worker.\u201d Gala Vanting, the president of the Scarlet Alliance, said there was \u201cfrustration\u201d in the sex worker community at her depiction in the media. She contrasted Dunn\u2019s death with other high-profile cases of violence against women in Australia. \u201cSomething that\u2019s notable for me is that it\u2019s the sex work community who are leaving flowers on Michaela\u2019s doorstop,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m reminded of Eurydice Dixon\u2019s murder in Melbourne, and the fact that an entire city flocked to the site of her death to leave flowers and remember her. In terms of their demographic, these two women had quite a lot in common, and yet the way they are grieved and spoken about by the media, the government, community leaders, it\u2019s very different.\u201d But there\u2019s no doubt Dunn\u2019s death has had a profound impact on other sex workers. Despite all sex workers employing their own safety measures, many who spoke to Guardian Australia this week said it had left them feeling vulnerable. One woman wrote on social media after Dunn\u2019s death: \u201cI might as well be walking around with a target on my back\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019re all feeling like our sense of safety has been shattered a bit,\u201d Rose Harper said. \u201cWe all know there\u2019s a certain level of risk but at the same time no one should expect to go to work and not come home.\u201d Vanting said part of the frustration came from an \u201cinference\u201d that Dunn\u2019s death was the result of her work, rather than the actions of the person who killed her. \u201cMy biggest take home from this is that misogynistic violence in Australia is still really out of control,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sex worker community doesn\u2019t need to change how they work or where they work, what needs to change is the structures they work within. The laws that restrict their safety, the governments who criminalise their labour and the media that stigmatises them. \u201cWhat it tells us is that sex workers have a right to feel safe at work. What it doesn\u2019t tell us is that sex work is inherently more dangerous than other careers, or that Michaela was in anyway to blame.\u201d The image that eventually emerged of Dunn was of a much-loved sister, daughter and friend. Tom Galea, the principal of Dunn\u2019s former high school Rosebank College, remembered her as a \u201chighly successful and much valued student\u201d at the school. \u201cShe was one of four social justice captains in her graduating year and an accomplished student with a passionate commitment to excellence who received academic merit awards in her studies,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was seen as a mature, resilient young woman and a positive role model.\u201d On social media, a friend described her as: \u201cThe most beautiful person, inside and out. \u201cYou would brighten up anywhere you went just by your presence; and now the world is truly a much darker place. I love you Mik\u2019s, so much.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
