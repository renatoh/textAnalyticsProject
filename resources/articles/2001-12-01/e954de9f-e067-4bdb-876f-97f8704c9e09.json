The comments follow the results of a major study, which has shown that children are far less likely to take A-levels and go to university if they come from single parent homes or poor households. The research suggests that the chances of receiving higher education are largely determined by the circumstances of children under the age of 10. \"There is not one single programme that is a panacea for this problem,\" said Dr Marco Francesconi, one of the authors of the study. Dr Francesconi believes cooperation between government departments could help tackle the problem. The study, carried out by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, reveals that boys who live in poverty between the ages of six and 10 stand a 45% chance of getting A-levels or going to university, while boys from all backgrounds stand a 52% chance of getting A-levels or going onto higher education. The impact of family disruption is even more dramatic, the academics found. Children who experience some disruption to their family life before the age of five stand only a 26% chance of getting A-levels or doing further study By adolescence, meanwhile, the study found much lower expectations of staying on in education among those from poorer backgrounds. Dr Francesconi said many of the government's schemes to lure more 16-year-olds into universities are too late for many children. \"It is a difficult task covering a lot of different factors from the behaviour of families and individuals to money and schools,\" he said. The findings are from Outcomes for Children of Poverty, a report commissioned and published by the Department for Work and Pensions. It provides one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the range of children growing up in the 1990s and the impact of poverty on their lives. Lack of parental resources when boys are in primary school lowered chances of education later in life, the study found. Young women's attainment was not substantially affected by parental resources - other characteristics, such as parents' education and family structure were more relevant. The higher educational attainment of parents significantly improved the probability of their children achieving higher educational results and getting a job. There was also a relationship between a mother's education and the chances of her daughter giving birth before the age of 21: the higher the educational attainment, the lower the chances of early childbearing. The research analysed data from the first nine waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), a nationally representative sample of 10,000 individuals in 5,500 households, who have been interviewed every year since 1991. The study was published this month by the Analytical Services Division of the Department for Work and Pensions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
