Wigfall, in her first book, shows a confidence and control that allow her stories to cross continents, centuries and a huge range of voices without ever losing a pinpoint, world-in-the-palm-of-your-hand accuracy. She is an assured literary conjuror, giving life to notorious criminals (Bonnie and Clyde), socialites (the LA film world, 18th-century Parisians) and mute children (with Virgin Mary obsessions). At times she confuses, seeming to create bizarre worlds suffering plagues of rats and multiple baby-kidnappings, only to reveal by the end of the story that the unreality is in the head of the narrator; the shock of the realisation adds - tenfold - to the emotions. It also forces you to read her stories again, slowly, to be convinced of how brilliantly constructed and beautifully rendered they are. This debut collection is energisingly, awe-inspiringly, intimidatingly good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
