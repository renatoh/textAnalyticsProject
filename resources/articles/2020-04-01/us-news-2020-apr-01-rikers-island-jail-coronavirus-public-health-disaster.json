In just 12 days, Ross MacDonald, the jail\u2019s chief physician, said confirmed cases at Rikers had soared from one to nearly 200. Speaking in response to a letter from five New York district attorneys and a special narcotics prosecutor criticising the release of \u201chigh-risk\u201d inmates following the outbreak of Covid-19, he wrote on Twitter this week: \u201cThe only part of the letter I can speak directly to is their failure to appreciate the public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.\u201d The notorious Rikers Island jail complex, one of the largest jails in the world, has become synonymous with violence and neglect, and is scheduled to shutter in 2026. Despite following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and having \u201cmoved mountains to protect our patients\u201d, MacDonald said infections were soaring. He added: \u201cThis is not a generational public health crisis, rather it is a crisis of a magnitude no generation living today has ever seen.\u201d He warned that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d they will be able to stop the growth, predicting that 20% of those infected will need hospital treatment and 5% ventilators. He also called for the release of \u201cas many vulnerable people as possible\u201d. More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the US, more than anywhere in the world, and there are growing fears that an outbreak could spread rapidly through a vast network of federal and state prisons, county jails and detention centers. With limited capacity nationally to test for Covid-19, men and women prisoners worry that they are last in line for information about the risks, and for treatment if showing flu-like symptoms. According to figures published by the Legal Aid Society, on Tuesday there were 180 cases of coronavirus in New York city jails, including Rikers, out of a population of 4,604 \u2013 13 more cases than the day before. The infection rate for the city\u2019s jails was 3.91%, equating to 39.1 infections per 1,000 people. In comparison, the infection rate for New York city was 0.5%, or five infections per 1,000 people. Jared Trujillo, president of the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, said Rikers was effectively the centre of the entire pandemic. \u201cNow, Rikers proportionately is the epicentre of the Covid-19 epidemic and our clients are terrified, my members of the union are horrified about it, they\u2019re horrified for their clients, being in court is dangerous for them. We have about two dozen members, probably more, that have either tested positive or just showing signs of Covid-19.\u201d For some vulnerable prisoners, he added, being in jail amid a coronavirus outbreak is \u201cultimately a death sentence for them\u201d. He claimed a lot of inmates, many of whom he said are pre-trial, don\u2019t have access to hand sanitiser or soap, are \u201ccaged\u201d in large communal areas and that many clients have complained that they are not having symptoms of illness taken seriously. He said the current environment is also having an impact on their mental health. \u201cJust psychologically it\u2019s really horrifying for people because they\u2019re hearing that these people that they\u2019ve been in close contact with, that they have been caged with for some length of time, have an illness, have a contagion, and there\u2019s just nothing they can do.\u201d Unless more action is taken to release people from Rikers, he warned: \u201cThe conditions will only get worse.\u201d As of Tuesday morning, 141 staff members and 180 prisoners on Rikers Island and other city jails had tested positive for coronavirus. The city\u2019s department of correction (DOC) said those people have been advised to self-quarantine and that they are following city guidelines to identify people they may have had contact with. Peter Thorne, deputy commissioner of public information for New York City\u2019s DOC, said it is doing \u201ceverything we can to safely and humanely house people in our custody amid the broader Covid-19 crisis\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have made tremendous efforts to increase social distancing throughout our facilities and escalated our hygiene and sanitation protocols in accordance with guidance from the city\u2019s department of health. We work closely with correctional health services to ensure that those who are symptomatic are promptly isolated and referred for treatment as necessary.\u201d The DOC said there was an \u201cadequate supply of soap and cleaning products\u201d and that all prisoners have access to sinks, soap and water. However, they are not allowed hand sanitiser because it is seen as a \u201csecurity risk\u201d. They said any employee with respiratory problems is sent home and is not allowed back without documentation from a medical professional that they do not have Covid-19 or flu. Measures also include screening any person entering the jail \u201c for flu-like symptoms\u201d, isolating prisoners \u201cif clinically indicated\u201d that they may have Covid-19 and placing any new arrivals with symptoms or people in custody who have tested positive in a separate facility. Across the state, Trujillo said the problems are \u201csimilar\u201d and called for more people to be released \u2013 particularly the elderly and the immunocompromised. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that\u2019s so terrifying for people that are in, but then also their families, and it\u2019s even exacerbated by the fact that right now people aren\u2019t getting visits,\u201d he added. New York state\u2019s department of corrections and community supervision (DOCCS) said that as of Tuesday morning, 123 employees, 14 prisoners and nine people on parole were confirmed to have coronavirus. For each confirmed case, a DOCCS spokeswoman said they work with the department of health to identify people who have potentially been exposed and notify them to try to stop it spreading. She said that staff and prisoners have been given information on preventive measures and they have suspended transfers and visitors. The Bureau of Prisons has temporarily halted visitation at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the US, including both social and legal visitation, though officials have said some exceptions could be made for legal visits.
