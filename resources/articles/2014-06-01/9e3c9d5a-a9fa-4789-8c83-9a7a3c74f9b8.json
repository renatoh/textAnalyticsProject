But this is the Cowley album for anyone who ever wished this gifted maverick might dig deeper: the pieces are varied (gospelly slow-burners, jazzy cat-and-mouse games, systems-music churnings, Jarrett-like churchy funk) and the playing richer and more intricate. At the Barbican in 2012, Cowley was apparently so startled by the effect of his quieter music on a concert hall, that he ditched months of work and started over. Touch and Flee is the result. Some might miss Cowley the chord-puncher, but there's no shortage of grooves here, they just come and go in more provocative and devious ways, and the trio are infallibly on each other's wavelengths. The gently wheeling motif and steady snare pulse of Kneel Down has some EST affiliations; Winterlude is wackily playful jazz-funk; Gang of One and Couch Slouch are catchy, meticulously overlaid groove games; the smoky Bryce is like a Tord Gustavsen meditation; and the slow-rocking Queen builds grippingly. It won't lose Cowley his core audience, but it should bring him plenty of new recruits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
