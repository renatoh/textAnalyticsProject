Moves to allow local communities to \"trigger\" local action by police and councils to tackle the most persistent problems in their areas were announced today as part of the government's drive to make people feel safer in their own neighbourhoods. The measure is one of a number of initiatives outlined in the National Community Safety Plan (NCSP), which sets out the government's key priorities for improving safety over the next three years. Announcing details of the plan today, Ms Blears said citizens will have a bigger say in how crime and antisocial behaviour is dealt with. The government has set a target of reducing overall crime by 15% within three years, as well as improving the public's perception of tackling crime. Ms Blears said progress on crime reduction was already underway, but that a \"further step-change\" was required. The NCSP signalled a major contribution to the government's \"Together We Can\" campaign to bring citizens and public bodies closer together so that more people can influence the decisions that affect their communities, she said. \"Crime is still too high and too many people's lives and too many businesses continue to be blighted by antisocial behaviour\", Ms Blears told a government-organised conference held today to showcase the action plan. \"Communities have a vital role in this partnership. We want to empower local people so that they can help determine community safety priorities in their neighbourhoods and work with the police and other local agencies to tackle the local problems they see. \"Working together we can build safer and stronger communities.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
