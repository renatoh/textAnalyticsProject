I was lucky enough to spend six months in Miri in 1996 as a researcher (aged 52) and your comments and pictures brought it all back. You must read Fever Trees in Borneo when you get back. I forget who it's by, but a very recent book. It will take you back to your river trips - one of the best of my experiences. Did you swim in the river pools? I'd love to go back, but no prospects of working there again unfortunately. The other thing I particuarly liked was your description of the bus journey. I travelled from Bintulu to Miri by bus (admittedly with a work colleague) The generosity of your bus companion I found really typical of the people there - particuarly the Dyaks - I don't know whether it' because Sarawak is a bit of a backwater compared to mainland Malaysia, but everyone was just so nice. My only advice to you is to beware the culture aftershock. I found it very difficult when I came back - six months was too long and too short at the same time. I had just started to acclimatise when I came back. Later on I read some research which said that sometimes returning can be worse than the problems of working abroad. However, I got over it, and it's when I am reminded of the good parts by such lovely descriptions yours that I don't regret it one little bit - it was great to have had the privilege of knowing such a marvellous magical places and people. All the very best to you Jones (May9)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
