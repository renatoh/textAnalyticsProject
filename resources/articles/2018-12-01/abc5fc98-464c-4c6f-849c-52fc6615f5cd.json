The 39-year-old star of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Ride Along has quipped his way to becoming one of the most dependable box office stars working today with his films totalling over $3.5bn worldwide. His social media presence has also been a major key to his success with 34 million followers on Twitter and over 65 million on Instagram and with ratings for the ceremony continuing to spiral down, the Academy clearly hopes he\u2019ll help draw viewers back in. After two years of straight white host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s rather dull shtick and after an increased push to improve the diversity of voters, choosing an African American host is also a much-needed leap forward on stage. But there\u2019s one small catch. Hart has a rather vile history of documented homophobia, ranging from offensive standup clangers to dumb interview statements to puerile tweets to a whole embarrassing film filled with it. In 2010 during his Seriously Funny standup special, Hart delivered an extended joke based on a fear of his three-year-old son Hendrix turning out gay. One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That\u2019s a fear. Keep in mind, I\u2019m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don\u2019t know if I handled my son\u2019s first gay moment correctly. Every kid has a gay moment but when it happens, you\u2019ve got to nip it in the bud! Hilarious, right? A gay kid! No, thanks! As his profile rose, the joke resurfaced and in a 2015 profile with Rolling Stone, he was asked to discuss it. After attempting a poorly conceived justification claiming that it\u2019s really all about his own fears and insecurities, he then blamed the climate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren\u2019t as sensitive as they are now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we love to make big deals out of things that aren\u2019t necessarily big deals, because we can.\u201d What might not seem like a big deal to Hart is less amusing when given a wider context. In his extended joke, he claimed to have beaten both his son and another kid who was \u201cgrinding\u201d up behind him at a party, something that feels particularly grotesque when viewed next to the multiple real world stories of parents beating and torturing their children to death when a so-called \u201cgay moment\u201d rears its head. Giovanni Melton, Gabriel Fernandez, Anthony Avalos, Ronnie Paris \u2013 just a handful of kids killed by parents because of either their perceived or confirmed homosexuality. During the same period, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008\u2019s Tropic Thunder because the character was gay and his behaviour was \u201creal flagrant\u201d before adding that he\u2019d never be able to play a gay character in the future. \u201cWhat I think people are going to think while I\u2019m trying to do this is going to stop me from playing that part the way I\u2019m supposed to,\u201d he said. The comments preceded his role opposite Will Ferrell in Get Hard, one of the most shockingly regressive gay panic comedies in recent memory, an almost two-hour film based around a fear of anal sex. In the film, Hart helps Ferrell\u2019s character prepare for a stint in jail but after minimal attempts to cover the specifics of prison life and protecting one\u2019s self in a fight, a strikingly dominant phobia of male rape takes over. I wrote about it at the time: The film\u2019s unarguably wretched low point arrives when Hart\u2019s character takes Ferrell to a gay brunch \u201chookup spot\u201d where he tells him he\u2019ll need to learn to perform oral sex to make his time in prison easier. While being eyed up by every gay man around them, Hart informs Ferrell of the relative ease of approaching a gay stranger for sex, because \u201cthat\u2019s what they do\u201d. After Ferrell immediately gets the attention of the depressingly used Matt Walsh, of Veep fame, he proceeds to attempt an unsuccessful bathroom-stall tryst, which disgusts him in such graphic detail that he can\u2019t go through with it. Meanwhile, Hart is approached by a predatory older gay man who, even after finding out Hart\u2019s heterosexuality, refuses to take no for an answer. Now, there\u2019s an important distinction to make here. The fear of rape is obviously legitimate and a man\u2019s fear of being raped by another man while in prison is also understandable and by no means homophobic. It makes sense that the film would at least address this but what makes less sense is why the writers have such an obsession with the idea. It punctuates every other line of dialogue and not even in particularly inventive ways (the script is essentially multiple, exhaustive variations on \u201cyou\u2019re going to get raped\u201d). Hart\u2019s response to criticism, from a gay journalist at the time, was predictably unbothered. \u201cFunny is funny, regardless of what area it\u2019s coming from,\u201d he said to HitFix\u2019s Louis Virtel. The film was also released just months after The Wedding Ringer, a film described by The AV Club\u2019s AA Dowd as \u201ca 100-minute gay joke\u201d. So why at a time when the Academy is desperate to show a more inclusive side would Hart seem like an appropriate host? Back in 2011, Brett Ratner resigned as Oscars producer after saying \u201crehearsal is for fags\u201d \u2013 a dim-witted use of a word that he shouldn\u2019t be using in the first place but after a quick search of Hart\u2019s Twitter feed, it seems that it also used to be a major part of his vocabulary. Calling someone a \u201cfat faced fag\u201d, comparing a profile picture to a \u201cgay bill board for AIDS\u201d and using the term \u201cno homo\u201d to frequently remind us of his superior heterosexuality. If he\u2019s even made to comment on any of this, I imagine he will use his youth as an excuse but the tweets in question were sent in his early 30s, quite clearly old enough to know the difference between right and bigoted. Hiring Hart is an indicative misstep that highlights how homophobia, casual or blatant, is still de-prioritised in comparison with other discriminatory belief systems. In the past few years, the Twitter feeds, routines and off-stage behaviours of comics have been pored over for signs of impropriety and numerous figures have been duly taken to task. But gay jokes remain somehow acceptable. Look at straight comedian Peter Serafinowicz\u2019s string of redubbed Trump videos, meant to be hilariously funny and unthreatening because he was speaking in a \u201cgay voice\u201d or check out straight comedians Chelsea Handler and Jimmy Kimmel comparing their Republican enemies to bottoms because that somehow equals lesser in their book or on a related note, cis comedians Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais continuing to ridicule trans people in recent specials. Hart\u2019s obsession with making unfunny, disrespectful and inappropriate jokes about a community he has shown nothing but bile for along with a string of unrepentant responses to any criticism paints him as someone entirely undeserving of a spot on the Oscars stage. If the Academy wants to progress and remain relevant, handpicking a man with a history of homophobia is a flashing red siren of an issue, a middle finger up to the LGBT community and a sign that Oscars might no longer be quite as white but they remain aggressively straight. This article was amended on 27 December 2018. An earlier version said that Brett Rattner was removed as Oscars producer in 2011. This has been changed to reflect that he resigned from the role."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
