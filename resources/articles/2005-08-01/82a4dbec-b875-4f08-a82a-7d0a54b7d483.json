With Matt Prior promoted to partner Ian Ward at the top of the order, he plays little part in the short game. But Ward is nursing a groin injury, and Montgomerie came in for his first Totesport outing since May last year, and only his fifth in any form of one-day cricket in two seasons. He seemed to relish it. He and Prior matched each other run for run, though Montgomerie had more of the strike, and after 10 overs the score was 69 without loss. Somerset, who had enjoyed the London life after their demolition of Lancashire to win the Twenty20 Cup on Saturday, bowled at first like men still nursing headaches. The opening pair reached their half-centuries in the same Ian Blackwell over, Prior in 40 balls, Montgomerie in 56, and two overs later the latter stretched at Blackwell and put him high over midwicket. It took the introduction of Wes Curston's off-spin to stop the charge, Prior lofting his third delivery to Andy Caddick deep on the leg-side, and the partnership had yielded 132 in the 20th over. The visiting bowlers found more discipline, and once Keith Parsons had sent back Mike Yardy with a neat caught and bowled to a spliced drive, the run rate was brought under more control. But Montgomerie was still there, always taking a single when the boundary was denied him, and he formed another fruitful alliance with Murray Goodwin as Blackwell, succeeding Graeme Smith as Somerset skipper, kept the bowling permutations going. For his second ever National League century Montgomerie tucked Charl Langeveldt into the leg-side, reaching the mark in a creditable 112 balls, with Goodwin scampering in attendance. Just short of a 100 partnership, and immediately after reaching a 61-ball half-century Goodwin played a round one from Blackwell. His effort had included just one six and one four, but the scoreboard had kept moving. Montgomerie cracked on, however, and a huge last-over six off Richard Johnson over mid-wicket took him to his best-ever one-day score. He finished undefeated on 132. Sussex, who are top of the Second Division, are seeking their seventh successive league win and finished on a competitive 266, but Somerset, their heads now cleared, were determined to translate some of Saturday's Oval euphoria into the league. Carl Gazzard, who was Saturday's man of the match in the semi-final win over Leicestershire, rose up the order to open with Matt Wood, and they were on a par with Sussex when, in the eighth over, Wood carved Rana Naved to a diving James Kirtley at deep mid-off. Gazzard was then run out by Mushtaq Ahmed, setting Somerset back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
