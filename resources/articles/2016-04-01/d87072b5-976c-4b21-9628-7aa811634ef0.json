The public accounts committee said DfID does a \u201cgood job\u201d in responding to crises overseas, but urged the department to use its influence at next month\u2019s world humanitarian summit in Istanbul to secure \u201cmuch needed change\u201d to the UN-led humanitarian system. It said the department also needed to do more to track its spending in long-running crises. \u201cIt is important to recognise DfID has had a positive impact in responding to some desperate situations around the world,\u201d said Meg Hillier, the PAC chair. \u201cIt is also important that, however public money is spent, the government is held to account for that spending. In responding to crises, achieving value for money means critical support can be provided more effectively to more of the people who need it. The taxpayer pound goes further,\u201d she said. DfID has often come under fire for how it spends the 0.7% of UK income pledged for foreign aid. It has been criticised for overambitious spending and a naive tendency to repeat unsuccessful initiatives, as well as its use of UK-based consultancy firms. The committee said DfID\u2019s spending on humanitarian crises had trebled in the four years to 2014-15 to exceed \u00a31bn, with the agency recognised as a major player. It praised the commitment and bravery shown by DfID staff in dangerous environments, noting that the agency was responding to 21 crises with a range of causes, including conflict, natural disasters and disease. DfID had achieved \u201ctangible results\u201d in several crises, including controlling the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, helping people in the Horn of Africa cope better with food shortages and aiding the government of the Philippines to prepare better for typhoons, it said. Although it said DfID was viewed as \u201cinnovative, agile and influential\u201d, the spending watchdog concluded the department did not \u201chave a full and clear understanding of what constitutes success across its crisis interventions\u201d. It noted the lack of a structured approach for protracted interventions, which limits DfID\u2019s ability to learn valuable lessons. \u201cThe department can improve value for money, particularly in its response to those complex, long-running crises, such as Syria and Yemen, in which it is increasingly involved. It needs to strengthen its systems for resourcing and assessing the performance of its interventions, as well as improving its oversight of partners,\u201d it said. DfID should routinely \u201cidentify all the bodies involved in providing assistance, the funding each receives and the main costs incurred. It should use this information to help manage risk and identify cost-effective partners and practices,\u201d it said. Noting that UN agencies received around half of the department\u2019s \u00a31.3bn spending on humanitarian activities in 2014-15, the report warned that value for money was undermined by overlapping remits and inflexibility in the UN system. \u201cThe department has found it difficult to influence the UN to adapt its structure and the practices of individual UN bodies to improve their effectiveness,\u201d it said. The watchdog urged DfID to report back on how well it had managed to push three priorities for UN reform \u2013 encouraging its agencies to work together; improve their data and extend the duration of their support for partners \u2013 at the world humanitarian summit. \u201cThe department is an influential player globally and it must make full use of this influence to help secure change in the humanitarian system,\u201d Hillier said. Barry Johnston, head of advocacy at ActionAid, said the government should be more transparent in showing how UK aid helps people affected by crises. \u201cBritain continues to honour its proud history of helping people in need, especially women and girls living in poverty or at risk of violence\u2026 Next month\u2019s world humanitarian summit provides an opportunity for the UK to champion greater transparency and effectiveness of aid spending,\u201d he said. DfID said it welcomed the committee\u2019s recognition of its success in tackling a wide range of crises. \u201cThe government\u2019s aid strategy places a heavy focus on ensuring value for money, and the UK is playing a lead role in discussions on the future of the international humanitarian system and overseas development, including the role of UN agencies,\u201d a department spokesperson said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
