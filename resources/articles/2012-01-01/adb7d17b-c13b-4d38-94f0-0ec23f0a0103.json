That match is likely to be Luis Su\u00e1rez's first away from Anfield after his eight-match ban for racially abusing the United defender Patrice Evra. Kenny Dalglish has no reservations about picking Su\u00e1rez to start against United, despite his concern over the treatment the Uruguay international may receive from opposition supporters once his suspension has been served. Beyond matters on the pitch, however, there is a realisation at Anfield that the potential for trouble will be greater than usual when the north-west rivals meet, given the fallout from the Su\u00e1rez affair and therefore a need to respond. Relations between the clubs, like those between Liverpool and the Football Association, have suffered badly since the 1-1 draw at Anfield on 15 October. Liverpool's staunch defence of a player who has admitted using the Spanish word negro once during his row with Evra, but was found guilty of using it or negros seven times by an independent regulatory commission, has been viewed by many as the root cause. Liverpool have cast doubt on Evra's integrity and are adamant that Su\u00e1rez has been punished for a cultural misunderstanding and his honesty in admitting to using the word when first presented with Evra's accusation, immediately after the match in October. Nevertheless, and having accepted Su\u00e1rez's ban, Liverpool accept a responsibility to reduce potential flashpoints at Old Trafford next month and intend to contact United on the issue. Liverpool officials are exploring what actions can be taken before the game and there has been no approach to United yet. Talks may even take place at ownership level, where Liverpool's principal owner, John W Henry, and chairman, Tom Werner, have been closely involved in the club's stance throughout the affair. The Premier League is prepared to mediate, if called upon. United are open to the prospect of working with Liverpool and will assess any proposals that are made. Liverpool will also use Su\u00e1rez's suspension period to discuss with the FA not only the procedures that led to the striker's eight-match ban, which the Anfield club believe to be deeply flawed, but measures that can be taken to aid the 24-year-old's return to the game. The independent regulatory commission and Evra both accepted that Suarez is not a racist and Liverpool believe sanctions should be brought against clubs whose supporters brand him as such. Their priority with the FA, however, the integrity of which Liverpool have also questioned, is to instigate changes to a system that currently sees the commission members appointed by the FA and given the power to find a player guilty of racist abuse on the balance of probability. Liverpool's handling of the entire episode has continued to attract fierce criticism and Piara Powar, the executive director of European football's anti-discrimination body, Fare, believes the FA should charge the club with bringing the game into disrepute. He said Dalglish had been \"undignified\" in his vehement support of Su\u00e1rez and that Liverpool's reaction had damaged their image across the world. \"This is a lack of respect for the governing body by Liverpool and the FA should charge Liverpool FC and Kenny Dalglish,\" Powar said. \"I think the FA should come back now and be very clear that Liverpool could be construed to have brought the game into disrepute by the way in which they have consistently undermined the judgment and by Kenny Dalglish's comments. Liverpool have been too keen to support their man and in doing so have whipped up a sense of paranoia amongst their fans. This is not the Liverpool FC that we have applauded in the past for their support for a whole range of issues. The responses from Kenny Dalglish have been undignified; the way in which they have dealt with the whole matter has been unprofessional. For the club to so aggressively militate against what looks to most people a considered judgment from the FA leads to a potential for anarchy.\" The FA is not expected to charge Liverpool but Powar said the club had suffered for its hardline stance on Su\u00e1rez. He added: \"They have damaged their brand, no question. There is no question that Liverpool do have a global appeal, but I have emails from colleagues in Africa asking me what the hell is going on. I think people will be watching this and I believe there is no question that their plans for global expansion will have been damaged by this. That's not to say they cannot come back from this but it has done them a lot of damage and they have not conducted themselves in a very palatable way.\" Dalglish, who with Manchester City is interested in Birmingham City's 17-year-old midfielder Nathan Redmond, said Friday's FA Cup third-round tie at home to Oldham Athletic offers welcome respite after a troubled week for the club. The Liverpool manager said: \"To get back on the pitch after the week we've had on and off it is the best thing we can do. It'll be a great time too for our people to show support for one another \u2013 for the players to show their gratitude towards the fans for the support they've given us recently, and also vice versa.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
