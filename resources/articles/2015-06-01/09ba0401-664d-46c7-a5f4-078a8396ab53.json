Senior officers at South Yorkshire police, which commanded the Orgreave operation and conducted the prosecutions, privately acknowledged that many officers did overreact at Orgreave, and that there was evidence that they committed perjury, but did not want that misconduct made public. In a report to be published on Friday, the IPCC says that the force\u2019s withholding of evidence about improper treatment of miners and perjury by officers, and its failure to investigate it, \u201craises doubts about the ethical standards of senior officers at South Yorkshire police at that time\u201d and suggests they were complicit. However, after two and a half years\u2019 research into evidence relating to the bitter Orgreave confrontation and prosecutions which followed, the IPCC has decided not to investigate further. Sarah Green, the IPCC\u2019s deputy chair, said that while she recognised \u201cthe seriousness of the allegations and their continuing effect on public confidence [in the police] in the affected communities\u201d, too much time has passed for the allegations of assault and misconduct to be pursued. Green told the Guardian that she accepted that the IPCC will be criticised for its decision, which follows a referral of the allegations by South Yorkshire police themselves in November 2012. The IPCC is running several major investigations, including into alleged South Yorkshire police misconduct following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, and investigating the same force for its more recent handling of allegations of child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs. \u201cWe aren\u2019t short of work in terms of current issues and previous issues which haven\u2019t been looked at before,\u201d Green said. \u201cI accept we might be criticised for the decision not to investigate the Orgreave allegations, but that is the decision I\u2019ve come to.\u201d Former striking miners and their union, the NUM, Labour politicians and campaigners have condemned the decision. Ian Lavery, the Northumberland MP and former NUM president, described the report as \u201ca nonsense and a whitewash\u201d. Yvette Cooper, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary and leadership candidate, said the IPCC\u2019s decision \u201clets down\u201d the Orgreave miners\u2019 families, and she questioned the IPCC\u2019s fitness to handle police misconduct allegations. Cooper called for an independent inquiry, potentially modelled on the full disclosure of police documents process overseen by the Hillsborough independent panel, and said of the IPCC: \u201cIf they are too limited to do the job, then someone else needs to. For too long there have been serious allegations about the way the miners were treated at Orgreave, but we have never had the truth.\u201d The IPCC examined files relating to Orgreave including those held by South Yorkshire police and their solicitors, Hammond Suddards, and transcripts of the 1985 trial for riot and unlawful assembly which led to 95 miners being acquitted. The confrontation of 18 June 1984 was the most bitter and infamous of the miners\u2019 strike, with 8,000 pickets seeking to prevent lorries leaving the plant, near Rotherham, met by a 6,000-strong contingent of police drafted in from all over the country. The IPCC\u2019s report notes that the South Yorkshire police officer in command accepted in court evidence that no warning was given before mounted police charged into the miners, and that much of the throwing of missiles by miners, claimed as a reason by police for charging, in fact happened after the charge. The report notes that BBC news footage was reversed to show the miners throwing stones before the police charged, an accusation the BBC has never officially accepted. Hospital records showed that contrary to the police story that they had responded to unprovoked violence, more pickets than police were injured, and they suffered serious injuries, including to their heads. The South Yorkshire police chief constable, Peter Wright, had previously decided with the force\u2019s prosecuting solicitor to bring charges of riot and unlawful assembly, which carried potential life sentences, if the circumstances warranted it. After the 18 June confrontation, 95 miners were charged, and ultimately none were convicted, as the main trial collapsed after police were cross-examined by defence barristers including Michael Mansfield. The IPCC confirms reports from the time that one police officer may have forged another\u2019s signature as a witness to his statement, then both officers swore on oath that the signature was genuine. When the court raised the possibility of having the signature forensically examined, the report notes, \u201cThe original statement went missing from the court, in circumstances which remain unexplained.\u201d The officer whose signature was apparently forged was said to have given a \u201cblatantly untrue\u201d account in court, and an independent investigation by Staffordshire police concluded there was evidence of perjury. \u201cThe Director of Public Prosecutions accepted this was so,\u201d the IPCC report states, \u201cbut concluded it was not in the public interest to prosecute.\u201d Thirty-nine miners charged at Orgreave sued South Yorkshire police for unlawful arrest and malicious prosecution, a case settled with the payment of \u00a3425,000 and no admission of liability. The IPCC found internal notes by Hammond Suddards, suggesting that senior officers at Snig Hill, the force headquarters, acknowledged that some miners had not been treated properly and there was some perjury by officers. \u201cThe note also raises further doubts about the ethical standards and complicity of officers high up in [South Yorkshire police],\u201d the IPCC says in its report. Kevin Horne, one of the 95 acquitted miners and a member now of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said he and other colleagues suffered a continuing injustice which required investigation. \u201cNobody has ever been held to account, and now the IPCC has said they cannot do it, we believe there should be a public inquiry and full disclosure of what happened. The fight will go on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
