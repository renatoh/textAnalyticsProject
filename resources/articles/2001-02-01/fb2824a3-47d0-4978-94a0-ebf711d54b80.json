The MP, giving evidence to the Commons standards and privileges committee , said some of the complaints against MPs were \"obviously ridiculous and politically motivated\" and led journalists to write up stories in a \"snide and suggestive fashion\". Only \"the more shameless crooks\" would become MPs if it continued, he warned. \"At least half\" of all complaints made to the standards and privileges committee since 1997 had been petty or malicious, Mr Clarke said. The list read like a Who's Who of British politics, proving they were made to attract damaging publicity, he told the committee. The former minister singled out in the \"absurd\" category complaints about William Hague's free use of a private gym John Prescott's use of a subsidised flat and the fees for John Major's and Ken Livingstone's lucrative speaking engagements. He also strongly defended the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, from accusations of advocating policies to benefit his paid consultancy with a US oil company. He said no MP or journalist believed that his consultancy with oil company Kerr McGee, \"which did not own a single petrol station\" benefited from Tory policies advocating cuts in petrol prices. The committee is examining tighter rules forcing MPs to declare fees and contracts for outside speaking engagements and insisting that employment contracts are deposited in parliament revealing exactly how much money they receive. Mr Clarke, who opposes this, told the committee: \"MPs are entitled to the same level of privacy that other citizens are entitled to expect in their activities outside parliament.\" He added: \"We do appear to be racing towards the American position, whereby individual tax returns and health records are made freely available to the public.\" Later Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general in Mr Major's government, called for one aspect of the rules to be tightened up - a proposal to exempt declarations of hospitality from regional quangos and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
