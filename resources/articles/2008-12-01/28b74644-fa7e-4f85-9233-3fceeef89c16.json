And it is certainly a club that unless it buys well in January \u2013 always a tough call \u2013 may well struggle to qualify for next season's Champions League. The title? That can certainly be forgotten about. It is a cliche that teams have to win at places like this because it is an underlying truth. Wenger, to his credit, is not giving up. Well, publicly at least. 'The league is wide open, but we're in a position where every point we drop we get asked \u2013 I can understand it,' he said when queried about the club's title prospects. 'But champions are the one who carry on when everyone else stops.' Yet with the gap to Liverpool now eight points, is the task not enormous? 'At the moment we do not look at it like that. We believe the next game is a potential game to close the gap to Liverpool.' Surely this is dreamland. Arsenal have become boring but pretty. They can pull out the big wins, as they have against Chelsea and Manchester United. But Fulham, Hull and now Middlesbrough have proved impossible. In truth, it was Gareth Southgate's team that might have claimed victory if they summoned more belief. But word gets around quick, and teams throughout the Premier League will surely soon start thinking that there is more than the odd, scrapped-for point to be had from Wenger's too young, too brittle collection of players. 'We've got to be pleased with the point we played very well, created some good chances,' said Southgate. 'There was some really good individual performances \u2013 from the back four, and from J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re up front on his own did exactly what was required.' Wenger's frustration was evident throughout the match, and in his civil but hurried handshake with Southgate when Peter Walton blew for time. In a howling Teesside gale the obvious question of which Arsenal team would show up had been answered in a way that only gave added value to Manuel Almunia's comments that the team has to react during games. Instead, having taken an undeserved lead, it was Middlesbrough who responded. After the teams had taken a look at each other, Southgate's men twice threatened early on to get in behind the visitors. From the second opportunity, a corner was forced which was taken by Didier Digard. Emmanuel Adebayor's defensive header in front of Almunia's near post went close to beating the keeper. Digard took the follow-up. Now the Togo striker's header flew dangerously across his area. This all happened in the opening 10 minutes. A weak Robin van Persie shot apart, Arsenal looked unlikely to score. Then they managed the trick. It came from Adebayor, who also created the opportunity with a majestic, swerving run that played in Abou Diaby inside the left of the Middlesbrough area. The midfielder's shot, saved by Ross Turnbull, won a corner. From Cesc F\u00e1bregas's delivery, Chris Riggott jumped and headed air. Behind him Robert Huth, failed to track Adebayor. The header went down and past Turnbull. For a moment the Riverside fell silent. Then the travelling support began taunting their opposite number only for the best answer to arrive before the half-hour. Ga\u00ebl Clichy might have cleared, but instead the ball ricocheted to Tuncay. The Turkish midfielder's instant bullet of a cross was met with an instinctive stooping header from Aliadi\u00e8re that grabbed him a third goal of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
