Apple and Amazon are locked in a fight over the future of the book. Both are trying to dominate the market for ebooks, which are expected to become increasingly important to readers in the digital decades ahead. Amazon made an early play two years ago with its monochrome Kindle ebook reader, but last week Apple's tanks arrived on Amazon's lawn with the launch of its latest invention. Having taken the music market by storm with its iPod and iTunes combination, Apple now hopes to repeat the trick with its new iPad and iBookstore. Macmillan is one of five publishers \u2013 the others being Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette \u2013 that have signed up with Apple to make ebooks available through its online store. In doing so, they have moved the pricing of ebooks away from the bargain $9.99 (\u00a36.26) price Amazon has been criticised by publishers for charging in an attempt to lure more people on to the Kindle. Last weekend, Amazon removed Macmillan books \u2013 including Booker prize-winning Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel \u2013 from its US website in protest at the publisher's demand that Amazon stop discounting its titles and start selling them instead at the $12.99 and $14.99 suggested by Apple. There was outrage in the publishing industry at Amazon's move, and hours later it was forced into a U-turn. It is now assumed that Amazon will have to match Apple's price for ebooks on Macmillan titles. \"We have expressed our strong disagreement and the seriousness of our disagreement by temporarily ceasing the sale of all Macmillan titles,\" Amazon said, before adding ominously: \"We want you to know that ultimately, however, we will have to capitulate and accept Macmillan's terms because Macmillan has a monopoly over their own titles, and we will want to offer them to you even at prices we believe are needlessly high for ebooks.\" It may seem like a local tussle between American firms, but it is being closely watched by British publishers. As one editor at a London publishing house put it: \"Whatever happens in the US will dictate what happens elsewhere in the world.\" Some publishers sensed Amazon gearing up for a legal fight with its use of the word \"monopoly\" in its response. \"I think they very specifically used that word,\" said one source, \"as a way of pointing out to regulators: 'We wanted to sell ebooks for under $10 but there is a pact between publishers and Apple which has forced the price of ebooks up'.\" The deal between Apple and its publishing partners has been likened to the Net Book Agreement, which aimed to keep retail prices high and was eventually declared illegal in the 1990s by the UK's competition authorities. Under the traditional book-selling model, publishers sell their titles at a wholesale price to retailers, who then decide what price to sell them to readers. On some titles they may decide to make a loss in order to get punters through the door. Under the Apple mode, however, the Californian company is merely an \"agent\" for the publishers, taking a commission on sales rather than setting the price itself. Its effect, however, is exactly the same: setting a floor for book prices. Macmillan's new deal with Amazon is also based on this \"agency\" model, with Macmillan selling its wares as though Amazon were little more than a books version of eBay. For Apple, its intervention in the books market is partly an act of revenge. A few years ago, some of the music labels teamed up with Amazon to try to break Apple's grip on the online music market by allowing Amazon to sell tracks \u2013 without so-called digital rights management (DRM) \u2013 at $0.89 each, undercutting Apple. Apple was forced to give the music companies greater pricing flexibility in return for DRM-free tracks on iTunes. The fight between Amazon and Macmillan is also typical of a traditional media company trying to get to grips with doing business digitally, according to Duncan Calow, partner at law firm DLA Piper. \"The whole publishing industry is predicated on being a paper industry \u2013 the clauses in writers' contracts that talk about approvals, for instance, still talk about approving bindings \u2013 and trying to turn it around and into a digital content industry takes time. This kind of debate is not just about short-term pricing but whether the model that we use to distribute on paper should be the model that develops for digital,\" he said. The pain of this transition is being felt across the media landscape, with everyone from newspaper and magazine publishers to music companies and film producers struggling with the power of the web. But the book industry has a couple of advantages over businesses in other areas which have seen the internet wipe out their profits. The companies trying to sell ebook hardware need the involvement of publishers. When Apple launched the iPod, buyers could take their existing CD library and digitise it. Downloading music from the web came later \u2013 the iTunes store was launched two years after the first iPod appeared. But readers cannot easily digitise their books for a Kindle or iPad. To sell their devices, the likes of Apple and Amazon need publishing firms to agree to make digital versions of bestselling titles available on the same day as the printed work is published. The technology firms recognise that demand for ebook readers will be limited if readers have to wait months to get the latest books. Secondly, online piracy is still embryonic in ebooks. While pirate copies of bestsellers such as Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol appeared on the web within hours of their release, the scale of piracy is nothing like it was when Apple opened its music store. Napster, for instance, had been closed down for two years by the time the iTunes music store launched. As a result, publishers are not as desperate to see the launch of legal digital stores as their music counterparts were five years ago. They want a good deal, rather than a deal at any price to stem the flow of piracy. They also want to see more than one player in the ebook market. And later this year Google will launch its own ebook store, Google Editions. The search engine plans to let publishers set their own prices. There may be another twist to this tail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
