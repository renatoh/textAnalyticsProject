Trump stayed on script and on message, a rare performance for the president who often digresses into ad-libs during public remarks. For this, Trump earned a fair amount of praise from media and political pundits, praise many felt was unwarranted and the product of a \u201clow bar\u201d Trump has set for himself. Media reactions A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.

Similar to the current system of subsidies, Republicans want them to be less generous, and to distribute them by age \u2013 not income. What it all means More than 60 law enforcement heads have appealed to the White House against a push to enlist police officers in the highly contentious job of deporting undocumented immigrants. In a joint letter, the chiefs objected to being thrust into \u201cnew and sometimes problematic tasks\u201d that will \u201charm locally based, community-oriented policing\u201d.

The former president has sold more than 4m copies of his three books already, and it\u2019s likely that number will skyrocket when his yet-to-be-written post-presidency manuscript hits shelves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
