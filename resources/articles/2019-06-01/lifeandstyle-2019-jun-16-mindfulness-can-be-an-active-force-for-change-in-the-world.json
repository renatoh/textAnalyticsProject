While he acknowledges one half of the Buddha\u2019s teaching of meditation \u2013 to alleviate suffering \u2013 he overlooks the second half, meditation as a path to enlightenment. That comes naturally with a dedicated practice, and that\u2019s where ethics come in. If the author\u2019s point is about why meditation is not marketed as being about ethics and making this world a finer place, the chances are that would be rejected by the mainstream. People must find their own ways to the truth and make their own choices. The website of the New Kadampa Tradition\u2013International Kadampa Buddhist Union, kadampa.org, puts it eloquently: \u201cIf we integrate Buddha\u2019s teachings into our daily life we will be able to solve all our inner problems and attain a truly peaceful mind. Without inner peace, outer peace is impossible. If we first establish peace within our minds by training in spiritual paths, outer peace will come naturally; but if we do not, world peace will never be achieved, no matter how many people campaign for it.\u201d Liza Horan Edinburgh \u2022 Ronald Purser\u2019s critique of mindfulness is based on a false premise. Advocates of mindfulness would not accept in the first place the idea, which Purser simply assumes, that some actions, processes and outcomes in the world, including enhanced material welfare and the political strife it may entail, are superior to others. It is this idea, mindfulness maintains, which leads the fevered and benighted mind to clutch at them, supposing salvation to lie only in their attainment. For the serenely aware proponents of mindfulness, as for the ancient Greek Stoics, everything in the world is equal. Dr Sophie Botros Sergei Abramov London \u2022 Ronald Purser poses a false dichotomy between revolution and mindfulness. Mindfulness, when expertly taught, can become an active force for change, not a passive suit of armour (notwithstanding the cynical corporate misuse of the practice). It would be worth his while spending time with peace, climate change and anti-capitalist activists and finding out how many are mindfulness practitioners. Mindfulness raises awareness personally and politically \u2013 and that wakefulness prompts action.
