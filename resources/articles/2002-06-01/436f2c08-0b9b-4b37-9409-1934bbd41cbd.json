The mayor of Tsuna on Awaji Island, temporary home of Sven-Goran Eriksson's men, wants permanent memorials of their guests. \"I want to erect some bronze statues of David Beckham, Michael Owen and coach Eriksson to remember how proud we were to have them here,\" says Wasaburo Kashiwagi. The statues would go up at the municipal ground used by England as their training pitch. \u00b7Conspiracy theory (part 95): the South Korean government has declared a public holiday for next Monday - the day after the World Cup final - so that millions of fans can recover from celebrating the capture of football's greatest prize. Possible counter-theory: sensing that mighty Germany will finally end the co-hosts' great adventure, the public had wanted the holiday tomorrow to ease the pain of possible semi-final defeat today, but the government felt it was too short notice for banks and businesses. \u00b7A South Korean judge proved to be a real sport and patriot yesterday, refusing an arrest warrant for a teenager and urging him to cheer on the national team. The 16-year-old student stole a calculator worth 3,400 won (\u00a32) from a car parked in Jeonju, one of the country's 10 cities hosting the finals. \"He is just a teenager. I thought arresting him is bad for his education,\" said judge Lee Jeong-ryeol. \"Rather, I decided to give him an opportunity to cheer the national team to boost his loyalty for the nation.\" \u00b7For the first time in the tournament's history there will be an award for the most entertaining team in the finals. It will be voted for by fans on the Fifaworldcup.com website and the winning country will be honoured after Sunday's final in Yokohama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
