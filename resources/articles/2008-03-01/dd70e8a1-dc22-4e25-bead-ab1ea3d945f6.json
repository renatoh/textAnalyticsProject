While we know there's an official vegetarian week in May, too, at Nibbles we like to be good, clear our plate, eat our five-a-day (the celery in Bloody Mary counts, right?) and promote a bit of healthy vegetarian living. If only so we can feel slightly less guilty about the Easter eggs we've been consuming recently and the cocktails we plan to consume soon ... So, this week's column is dedicated to all things vegetable and this week's Bloody Marys will be Worcestershire sauce-free. Tea for two We're usually too busy slaving over a hot keyboard to get out for afternoon tea (I know, it brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?), but if we did, we'd hop on a train to Brighton to indulge at our favourite vegetarian restaurant, Terre \u00e0 Terre. If you're muttering something about steaks under your breath, surely you can be tempted by finger donuts with a chocolate dunk dip, chestnut chocolate tiny tartines, orange and almond sticky cake and sugar biscuits? Tea for two (or multiples thereof) costs \u00a316.50 and is available from Tuesday-Friday between noon and 7pm. Heavenly cooking If you love fine dining but want to avoid meat and fish, there are plenty of options available. One of the best is Manna, which has just been crowned top vegetarian restaurant by the Good Food Guide London. It is said to be the oldest gourmet vegetarian restaurant in Europe, and is a perennial favourite with Primrose Hill's celebrity locals. We love the way the chefs go the extra mile to make their dishes super-special, such as the Creole sweet potato galette: baked with Monterey jack cheese, topped with black bean, red pepper and sweetcorn hotpot and fried okra, and served with grilled plantain, avocado and lime puree, and coconut and habenero salsa. Well, you'd think twice before trying it at home, wouldn't you? Haute vegetarian: London If that whetted your appetite, why not seek out a vegetarian tasting menu? In London, the Orrery, Morgan M and Roussillon all have superb menus for discerning veggies. The Waterloo Brasserie has even created a new menu especially for Veggie Month. In fact, London-based veggies will soon be spoiled for choice, especially when York's former favourite, Vanilla Black, relocates next month. If uber-carnivore Jay Rayner likes it, you know it's got to be something special. Haute vegetarian: nationwide Outside of the capital, the tasting menus at Drakes in Surrey and The Compleat Angler in Marlow can give the London eateries a run for their money. Further afield, there are numerous restaurants that have moved far beyond the lentil burger level of meat-free cuisine. The cream of the crop include the Bean Inn in St Ives, Demuths in Bath, Caf\u00e9 Maitreya in Bristol, Sibila's in Birmingham, Greens in Manchester, the Waiting Room in Stockton on Tees and Henderson's Bistro in Edinburgh. Revamp your repertoire We've focused on going out this week, so we'll finish with a little something for those watching their wallets - or their waistlines.

You might just surprise your carnivorous friends with a delicious, home-cooked, meat-free feast. \u00b7 News to tell us?
