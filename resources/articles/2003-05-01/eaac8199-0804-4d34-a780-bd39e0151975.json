Whether this means United will conquer Europe again in the next two years, or it means he will continually postpone his retirement until they have done, is unclear. 'I do think we can win it before I retire,' said Ferguson, in looking ahead to this week's final, at Old Trafford, between Juventus and AC Milan. 'I have two years remaining on my contract, plus an option. We are close to winning the Champions League again. We have played some really terrific stuff in the competition in the last two seasons.' Ferguson intends to strengthen his defence during the summer, having lost Wes Brown to another cruciate injury. Juventus and Milan have reached the final through the sheer reliability under pressure of their defenders. 'We are short of experience at the back compared to those two,' Ferguson explained. 'We have some good young defenders, but I'll probably be looking for experience in summer, especially with Wes being out.' One player they might chase is Lucio, Brazil's World Cup-winning centre-back whose club, Bayer Leverkusen, have had a terrible season. He was valued at \u00a322million a year ago and would cost a fraction of that now. 'I won't be trying to change the way we play,' Ferguson added, 'just strengthen the defence. It would be very hard for us to change our attacking philosophy, and I see no reason to when we have contributed so much to the competition this year.' Rather cheekily, Ferguson includes helping eliminate Real Madrid among United's recent achievements in Europe. 'I fancied Juventus all along in the semis, because we knackered Real Madrid in the quarter-final,' Ferguson said. 'They looked out of it after their games against us.' Ferguson favours Juventus for the final, though he concedes they will miss Pavel Nedved, a player long-coveted at Old Trafford. 'I've got to go for Juve after they've won the Italian title,' he explained. 'I don't think it will necessarily be a bad game either. I'm sure Juve will go for it and try to score, it's the way they play. They have a strong defence but they also have a brilliant work ethic, and top goalscorers in Del Piero and Trezeguet. They aren't really a defensive team. The only time they have played that way this year was against Barcelona.' It seems unlikely that Wednesday's final will resemble the last Champions League action seen at Old Trafford, the high-scoring second-leg visit of Real Madrid last month, but Ferguson is probably right in suggesting Italian football has been unfairly denigrated as negative and uncompromisingly defensive. 'The Italians have proved a point this season with three in the semis and two in the final. It is only a year ago that people were talking about the demise of Italian football. What you can say about the Italians, at both club and international level, is that when blips come along they never seem to last long. Even their financial problems might have made them stronger - perhaps they turned out to be a good thing.'
