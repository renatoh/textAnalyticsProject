The extent of the divide was illustrated again last week when Mori's annual poll showed that the vast majority of people believe directors of large companies are untrustworthy and overpaid. Three-quarters are sceptical about firms' intentions to honour their pension commitments. One poll might be a blip, but this is no flash in the pan. In the 25 years of the Mori poll's existence, the 'veracity score' of top bosses (the proportion of people who trust them) has never topped 32 per cent. That beats politicians and, ahem, journalists, but no one else. And while the results reflect attitudes to directors in general, other surveys that test opinions of respondents' own managers largely confirm the findings. Thus Mercer Human Resource Consulting found last year that only four in 10 employees trusted their managements or thought their behaviour was consistent with company values. Fewer than half reckoned that their company was well managed. Disturbingly, the Mercer figures showed that trust declined with length of service and the veracity of management communication was doubted by even senior managers. For Mercer it's not hard to trace the immediate causes of the malaise: accounting scandals, executive pay, 'restructuring' (aka downsizing) and the pensions crisis. One of those on its own might not make much difference. But when your 'company's losing money, the directors are fiddling the books and lining their pockets and the pension doesn't look too secure - man, that's a pretty devastating combination', says Patrick Gilbert, Mercer's head of organisation research and effectiveness. Bob Worcester, chairman of Mori, agrees with 'all the above'. But just as serious, he argues, is the long-term failure of company chiefs to communicate the business message effectively to stakeholders: 'The attitudes of young people are mostly due to ignorance. Company leaders have a duty to the business profession to put their heads over the parapet and take the message out to schools and other forums. That kind of thing's expected and accepted in the US, but much less so over here.' At the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, head of employee relations Mike Emmott finds a grain of comfort in the fact that (fortunately for companies) distrust of top management does not prevent people feeling a degree of satisfaction with their company and their work. 'People can feel that, by and large, they're getting something from the job and still be cynical about management-speak and behaviour,' he says. However, the institute sees the underlying issues as deeply divisive, particularly excessive executive pay and pensions. 'Having a protected minority which alone is immune from the pain and insecurity everyone else is suffering is terribly, terribly damaging,' he warns. The political backlash has not yet begun. There's a deep irony, he notes, in the fact that while companies are feeling themselves pushed to make ever-more high-flown claims of environmental and social responsibility, at a much more basic level their employees and customers don't trust a word they say. So they are setting themselves up for failure. In the end, he believes, it's a risk-management issue - and a high-stakes one at that, involving not only the trust and commitment of employees but brand and reputation as well. The only remedy is a policy of brutal truth, admitting mistakes and failure to live up to aspirations as they happen. This is tough medicine, running counter to all the instincts and institutionalised pressures to put a positive spin on events. But the alternative is worse. 'The unfortunate truth is that when your credibility falls, you have less and less ability to influence people. It's very bad news that trust in senior management is so low.' But something else is going on here. Like many issues that seem to reflect poor 'people management', lack of trust is a symptom, not the illness itself. Accordingly, the approved HR techniques, from recruitment and teamwork to rational pay systems, although obviously worthwhile improvements, are in the end only a palliative. A fundamental cause of the debilitating lack of trust is the way companies are designed and managed. Whatever the enlightened rhetoric, implicit in the structures, processes and cultures of most organisations is the assumption of command and control. Managers decide; others do. Management is separate from work, an abstract activity hived off in remote offices. Decision-making is similarly distanced from where the work actually takes place. The top-down, enforcement culture is locked into place by a rigid budgeting process that imposes a regime of targets and fixed performance contracts on individuals and functions. Not to put too fine a point on it, such regimes - often even tougher and cruder in the public than the private sector - are built on secrets and lies. The higher you go, the less managers understand about the work and the more likely their interventions are to destabilise it. Top managers - the ones who will talk to the press about values, corporate social responsibility and reputation - are almost totally isolated from the product or service and the means of producing it. People on the front line do understand it, but have no authority to make improvements. Cheating is institutionalised as people struggle to meet targets that are out of date on day two of the new budgeting year. Such organisations manufacture cynicism and distrust as inevitably as the centrally planned state enterprises of the old Soviet Union - which, incidentally, they greatly resemble. The solu tion is equally radical. As with badly designed factories puffing out pollution, mistrust needs to be designed out from the beginning, not smoothed away with HR techniques at the end. Decision-making needs to be reunited with work and the organisation designed as a whole system. Management's job is constantly to search for ways of improving the system based on a deep understanding of the work, nothing else. In such a united system, the purpose does the communicating and the cynicism-breeding rhetoric is redundant. Basic stuff, but unless they attend to it, business leaders will still be propping up Mori's veracity league in another 25 years' time. As for journalists ... well that's another management story.
