After the fading of instinctive disbelief that politicians have actually promised to do something as concrete as pass a law to enable this it takes just a minute to see how progressive and constructive this could be for the clubs and the game. On consideration, two fans on the board of a club, treated with respect, consulted, marching on together with the other directors, can bring a smile to your face. Yet if the Premier League acts in character, its 20 owners, dominated now by absentee billionaires, served by their chief executive, Richard Scudamore, and his lobbyist Bill Bush, will fiercely oppose the proposal. The usual way of such skirmishes over 17 long years since Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government launched its football taskforce with a view to easing the aggressive capitalism of the Premier League era, will be that individuals are criticised, too. So it can be expected that Clive Efford, Labour\u2019s well-meaning, diligent shadow sports minister, who decided his party must do this after a long consultation with supporter groups, may now be a target for bile. If the Premier League clubs, and a majority in the Football League \u2013 where in fact AFC Wimbledon, Exeter City and Portsmouth are now majority owned by democratic supporters trusts \u2013 do react with hostility, they will be making a very clear statement to their supporters. They will be saying: we consider you old and mature enough to pay \u00a3600, \u00a3700, \u00a31,020 for a season ticket to watch the club you supported for pennies in your youth but we do not consider you grown up enough to consult, embrace and work with professionally. The Premier League will also in effect be saying it rejects the wider implementation of a model Scudamore himself has cited as the ideal: that of Swansea City. As has been well\u2011documented, Swansea\u2019s fans\u2019 trust was formed in 2001 according to the mutual, democratic model developed in the early days of the organisation Supporters Direct. Swansea\u2019s trust took a 20% stake, which it has maintained throughout the club\u2019s dazzling rise through the divisions, alongside the businessmen, themselves nearly all fans, who own the other 80%. From that new beginning Swansea have had a director, first Leigh Dineen, now Huw Cooze, elected by the trust membership. Cooze and the chairman, Huw Jenkins, have explained there is mutual respect and the fans\u2019 trust plays a hugely important role in guiding the club\u2019s decision-making. It is impossible to conceive Swansea\u2019s board indulging a sudden desire to change the name from City or the colour of the kit. That happened to Cardiff City, along the M4, where the single magnate Vincent Tan decided that red, not blue, is a more appealing colour in east Asia, where his interests are. Labour\u2019s football taskforce led to the founding of Supporters Direct \u2013 although no government has funded the organisation \u2013 to promote the ideal of mutual fan ownership as the true character of a football club. Yet while this fine idea has grown, gaining strength from the successful German Bundesliga\u2019s \u201c50%+1\u201d model of majority supporter control, the British owners of club shares made multimillions for themselves by selling to single billionaires. The owners are mostly remote now, at Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, at Manchester City, Aston Villa and others. The quality of the clubs\u2019 stewardship varies, although it is undoubtedly more professional than in the generally amateurish past under the local businessmen-owners. Yet few who love football can really believe that control of the British game and its clubs rightly belongs to the six children of Malcolm Glazer, to John Henry, Stan Kroenke, Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, Randy Lerner or Roman Abramovich. These men have money \u2013 \u00a3525m of it was borrowed in the Glazers\u2019 case \u2013 and a mixed record of success in running clubs to which they had no connection before. The owners and Scudamore do not themselves argue that clubs are just commercial companies; they always call them \u201cclubs\u201d which are membership organisations, and they appeal in their marketing to supporters\u2019 loyalty, to all being in it together. Politicians\u2019 warm words on involving supporters in clubs could thaw pitches throughout a frozen winter. Efford has realised that, if Labour does believe clubs are more than businesses, as he and his leader, Ed Miliband, say they do, he had to commit to act. This Conservative-Liberal Democrat government actually wrote into their coalition agreement that they would \u201cencourage co-operative ownership of football clubs by supporters\u201d. In almost a full term they have achieved nothing towards that goal. If Labour is elected and supporters\u2019 trusts gain the right to election on to their clubs\u2019 boards, this can be done in a positive spirit, for the benefit of fans, clubs and owners. It will benefit football, too, ease the dislocation between the game\u2019s heritage and the love so many people have for it, and its modern incarnation as a financial punt or trophy asset for a handful of the global rich. The Premier League, too often the bully, should meet this with a grown-up response and consider how to make it work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
