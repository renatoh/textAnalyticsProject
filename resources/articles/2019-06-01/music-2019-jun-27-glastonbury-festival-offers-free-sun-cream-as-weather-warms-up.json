After a month of inclement weather the forecast is for a dry weekend with a high of 28C predicted for Friday and 27C for Saturday. The festival emailed ticketholders on Monday advising them to prepare for hot weather. It suggested visitors brought hats and sunscreen, reusable bottles for water, and that they did not drink too much alcohol. In addition to the 800 water taps on site there are mobile water units and 37 WaterAid kiosks giving out water and bottles. Leah and James, from Hereford, who were sunbathing in front of the Pyramid stage on Thursday, said it was allergies rather than sunburn that were concerning them. \u201cHay fever is a killer. I\u2019ve got the take antihistamines but it doesn\u2019t really help, the grass is killing me,\u201d said James. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to buy more sunscreen,\u201d said Leah. \u201cI\u2019m going to burn. But there are loads of places you can get a drink, so at least we\u2019ll be hydrated.\u201d The festival said free sun cream was available at information points and property lockups, and extra shaded areas would be opened if needed. It said the weather was always closely monitored and messages about the conditions would be shared on social media channels. Anna, from south-east London, and Will, from Winchester, said they had learned after a few times attending Glastonbury that the key was preparing for anything. \u201cI\u2019ve bought a new water bottle and sun cream, but I would have done that anyway,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably drinking less alcohol and having more water. It\u2019s common sense really.\u201d Will said: \u201cThe water is free and I\u2019ve got enough sun cream, it\u2019s more about finding the shade. There are going to be hours when it\u2019s not going to be smart being out in the sun.\u201d On Wednesday the official Glastonbury Twitter account retweeted a recorded message from the South Western ambulance service urging festival-goers to \u201cwear sensible footwear \u2026 wear sunscreen, a hat would be great and stay hydrated\u201d. The festival said a sophisticated medical operation was ready to deal with any sun-related issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
