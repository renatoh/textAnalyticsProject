I am in my early seventies but fairly fit. I would like to visit villages along the western seaboard and, if possible, make a short tour on foot, preferably in a small group led by a local guide. Brian Spencer, Matlock Greenland is not cheap, but it is accessible from Copenhagen via Air Greenland (www.airgreenland.com ). Direct flights are available to Kangerlussuaq or Narsarsuaq and cost around \u00a3800 return, but considerable discounts are available for advance booking. Subscribe to Air Greenland's newsletter for details of good deals. The best way to get from Britain to Copenhagen is by budget airline. An overnight stop there is not always required. In Greenland you can use the ferries that link coastal villages. You should book ahead. Using them is a great way to see majestic scenery and meet local people. The services are run by the Arctic Umiaq Line (www.aul.gl). Seek out Greenland Outfitters. They're qualified, English-speaking guides who can provide hiking, kayaking and just about anything else you might want to do. See www.greenland.com for details. My wife and I are off to Brazil in April. For our first 11 nights we will be staying at a lodge in the Atlantic rainforest, going on bird- watching trips and enjoying the grounds and birds of the lodge. We then return to Rio de Janeiro for three nights. We plan to visit the statue of Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf Mountain. Are there any more things we should see in Rio? Philip and Beverley Tyler, by email Rio has some obvious spots which you've already targeted, but in three days you should get to some lesser-known gems as well. Spend your first day at Sugar Loaf Mountain (Pao de Acucar). This is accessible by two cable cars and offers wonderful views by day or at sunset. Rio's neighbourhoods all have distinct personalities. Explore the Centro area for excellent lunches, and glitzy Leblon for night-time dining. Older, working-class neighbourhoods such as Botofago and Urca make for lovely daytime wandering, as does the Bohemian, historic Santa Theresa. Don't miss a ride on the tram that rattles up there from Centro. The antique shops of nearby Lapaare worth a visit, as are the numerous churrascarias, or barbecue restaurants. A visit to Rio wouldn't be complete without at least half a day on the beach, so head for Ipanema on your final day. Save Christ the Redeemer for your last day as a farewell. Follow simple rules and you should have no safety problems. Don't walk on beaches or empty streets at night, and take taxis after dark. Carry only the money you need each day. You will find more information on the Riotur website, www.riodejaneiro-turismo.com.br. I will be travelling to southern India and Sri Lanka for around six months, starting in February. I am eager to find voluntary work for at least two months, but I understand that these placements usually cost sizeable amounts of money. I am on a tight budget and can't afford these fees. I would welcome advice on how to secure voluntary work in a country such as India. Devina O'Neill, by email Volunteering, at least with a recognised agency, generally costs money. As well as making a contribution to the cause you're volunteering for, your board, lodging and other expenses need to be covered. Though this adds to the cost of your trip, you know your work is for a good cause, and you should also be able to see where your money is going. The alternative is to go direct to organisations working in India or Sri Lanka, which you can approach in advance. There's no shortage of people prepared to spend a week in an orphanage but few are willing or, just as important, have the skills to work with mentally ill people. A background of some volunteer work in the UK (see www.timebank.org.uk) would demonstrate a commitment to help. The latest edition of Lonely Planet's India guide (\u00a317.99) lists contacts. Feedback Another place for Sophie Johnstone (Ask the Experts, 16 October) to visit when in Tallahassee is Wakulla Springs, one of the world's largest and deepest fresh-water springs. It's just 14 miles south of the city. Take a guided boat ride to see alligators, turtles and lots of birds. Claire Nelson, by email Your answer on rail travel between Poland and Lithuania (16 October) was wrong. First, there is no longer an overnight train from Poland to Lithuania. It was replaced by a bus. Second, for many years no trains have gone from Poland to Lithuania via Belarus. Marcin Kulinicz, Warsaw \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall from Lonely Planet addresses as many as possible here. Email escape@lonelyplanet.co.uk or write to Lonely Planet, 72-82 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4RW.
