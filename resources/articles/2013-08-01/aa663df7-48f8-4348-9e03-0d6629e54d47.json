His job will benefit should it also inspire a desperate longing against Manchester United. Coyle has been tasked with winning automatic promotion by Dave Whelan, the Wigan chairman, who saw his lifetime's ambition of FA Cup glory arrive on 11 May, then the club's Premier League status disappear on the 14th and manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez follow suit to Everton three weeks later. Turbulence has extended into the transfer market, with James McClean taking a pay cut from Sunderland to become the club's 10th summer signing on Thursday and nine members of the relegated, Cup-winning squad leaving the DW Stadium. The Community Shield and Europa League provide distractions from Wigan's solitary, crucial aim for the season, one that commenced with an impressive display and 4-0 win at Barnsley last weekend. But Coyle believes United at Wembley will increase Wigan's yearning to turn a fleeting return to the biggest stage into a permanent one next May. \"There's no getting away from it, every one of us craves the Premier League,\" said Wigan's new manager, who suffered relegation from the top flight with Bolton in 2012. \"When you've been there, that's the level you want to operate at but no one hands you that, you have to earn it. We have to come through 46 games to prove we are worthy of it. \"Our priority is to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking. But there is a feelgood factor going back to a venue the club has done well at and Sunday is a great opportunity to look at the champions of England and see the level we want to be playing at every week. We will see how far we need to go to get back to that level of playing against the Chelseas, Manchester Uniteds and Manchester Citys.\" Coyle insists he has not walked into a club in despair following the end of its eight-year residency in the Premier League. \"There can be hangovers,\" he says. \"But it's a funny one because as much as there was disappointment, you can't get away from the fact that winning the FA Cup was a huge achievement. \"To credit the players \u2013 the ones I inherited \u2013 their attitude has been first class from day one. We had a fans' forum last week and there were 400 here. There could be negativity because we have lost our Premier League place but the fans are up for the challenge and that's refreshing to see.\" Wembley also brings the Wigan manager into opposition with his friend and compatriot David Moyes, a man he touted to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United several years ago and who he played against in Scotland. \"There was the Skol Cup semi-final of 1991 which I remember well because I was man of the match,\" Coyle recalls, although his Airdrie team ultimately lost on penalties to Moyes's Dunfermline. \"I must have given David a torrid time if I was named man of the match! \"It is great for football lovers to see someone like David get the opportunity to manage Manchester United. For a long time there was a need at elite clubs in this country to make a sexy appointment, and there have been some fantastic managers from abroad, but it's great that Manchester United have shown there are terrific British managers out there and David Moyes is certainly that. I think every coach in this country has taken a lift from his appointment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
