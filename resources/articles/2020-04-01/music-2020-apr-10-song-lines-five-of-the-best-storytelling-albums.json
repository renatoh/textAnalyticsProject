His fourth album teems with life, its characters including \u201cthe girl with the mousy hair\u201d (Life on Mars?) and the lovers in Kooks, cooing over their baby\u2019s \u201cfunny old pram\u201d. Listen to Kooks Belle and Sebastian If You\u2019re Feeling Sinister (1996) Was ever so much kitchen-sink detail crammed into one album? The Scottish indie-popsters\u2019 second LP packs a poignant punch precisely because it\u2019s not a highfalutin concept album \u2013 rather, a collection of tender tales of real people, watching telly, having misplaced crushes and worrying about God. So convincing, it was even made into a stage musical. Listen to The Stars of Track and Field Kendrick Lamar Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012) A natural storyteller since he was a schoolkid in LA, Lamar would go on to win the 2017 Pulitzer prize for music with his album Damn. But it was his 2012 major label debut that first shone a light on the genre-bending rapper, via his evocative semi-autobiographical tales of growing up in Compton. Listen to m.A.A.d city Pulp Different Class (1995) From the pie-eyed field-ravers of Sorted for E\u2019s and Wizz to the poverty tourist in Common People, via the crushing first-love-anthem Disco 2000, this is a masterclass in colour-saturated storytelling. Pulp\u2019s pop theatrics set the stage for a cast of movingly real characters. Listen to Common People Bobbie Gentry Ode to Billie Joe (1967) A country-soul singer-songwriter from Mississippi, the 25-year-old Gentry had a preternatural gift for observation and songcraft, evidenced on her debut LP\u2019s title track \u2013 a southern gothic tale that moves from humdrum indifference to human tragedy in the same beautiful breath.
