Briefly, the former England opening bowler thinks about leaning on a pavilion railing to look across the ground where he will soon operate as county cricket's most intriguing new captain. But the miserable reality of an early-April afternoon in Leicester induces a loud groan. \"It's bloody wet,\" Hoggard says in mock indignation. The absurdity of preparing to play cricket at the end of a long, hard English winter sends Hoggard back inside to explain how the pain of the last two years has brought him here in the hope that a different county, and new responsibility, might transform his mood. Yet it will be difficult to feel sunny this week, for the ritual of escaping the rain is likely to be repeated when Leicestershire's opening match of the season begins on Friday, against Northamptonshire. \"It's weird trying to play cricket in April,\" Hoggard says, safely back inside, \"but coming to Leicestershire as captain gives me a clean slate. I've come here to do a job which I'm more than capable of doing. I'm going to prove that to myself and my team and become a good leader. The key will be to judge the situation right. Is it time for me to put a hand around their shoulders or give them a rocket up the arse? I need to get that right but I'll still tell the truth. I'll call a shovel a shovel and a pick a pick.\" Hoggard lets slip a bleak smile at that echo of old Yorkshire. He has always enjoyed being described as a taciturn moaner and has often quoted his favourite line from Harry Enfield's parody of a quintessential Yorkshireman: \"I say what I like and I bloody well like what I say.\" And so Hoggard sounds bluntly satisfied when hammering home his views on captaincy. \"There're not going to be any lies or feelgood factor for the sake of it. They're going to get truth and honesty from me and as long as everyone is truthful in return we'll be fine. \"So far it's seemed an easy place to settle with a good set of lads. A lot of them are young and if I say something it's more a case that they'll listen rather than go, 'What do you know?' So that's good. But, first and foremost, I need to take wickets and play well. Then I can start leading them towards the pinnacle.\" Hoggard grunts at a suggestion that, after Leicestershire finished bottom of Division Two last season, it sounds deceptively simple. \"Cricket is a very simple game made complicated by the people who play it,\" he says. Cricketers, more than most sportsmen, are besieged by tangled emotions. The psychological trauma the game can induce is underlined by the way in which the resilient and gruffly laconic Hoggard has been shredded over the last two years. He has felt betrayed twice over, first by England and then Yorkshire, for whom he played 14 seasons, and struggled as he and his wife, Sarah, have been afflicted by depression. Hoggard's reaction to that heartache is made even more affecting by its terse truthfulness. He began to unravel in March 2008 in New Zealand. Playing in what turned out to be his final Test for England, he looked at his captain, Michael Vaughan, and, in the middle of his over, said: \"I'm doing a Tres here, I'm going cuckoo.\" Hoggard shudders at that blithe reference to the acute depression suffered by Marcus Trescothick \u2013 but in New Zealand he felt like breaking down and crying. He and Sarah were having a difficult period in their marriage and she was weighed down by post-natal depression following the birth of their son, Ernie, in May 2007. Hoggard never played for England again. Was that confession of psychological frailty a significant factor? \"I wasn't in a good place at the time, but it's tough. International sport is ruthless \u2013 and they were ruthless with me. But, yeah, maybe it was part of the downfall.\" Before that collapse, Hoggard had bowled well in Sri Lanka and his suspicion lingers that he was axed after one bad Test. \"They dropped Harmy [Steve Harmison] as well so I think it was to soften the blow for him. They wanted a bit more pace so they brought in Jimmy Anderson and he's bowled very well. You could say they were justified but I'd have backed myself to get a few wickets in the next Test.\" Harmison has since been given repeated chances at Test level but Hoggard never had that luxury. \"They never gave me a second chance,\" he shrugs. \"It hurts.\" There is a flash of defiance, however, when he is asked if his loss of pace, the elusive \"nip\" which separates a county professional from a Test\u2011match operator, contributed more to his exclusion. \"I'm a good bowler and I still want to play for England but I'm a realist. I'm 33. England made that decision two years ago and I've not heard anything from them in all that time. I don't think they'll pick me again \u2013 no matter how well I bowl.\" Last season, as Yorkshire's leading wicket\u2011taker, Hoggard played a crucial role in a decisive battle against Sussex. He got a hat-trick, made a match-turning run\u2011out and was part of a vital last\u2011wicket stand of 38 as he helped his old county to a win that saved them from relegation. \"I helped,\" he says, laughing loudly. Did Hoggard know then that Yorkshire were about to jettison him? \"No. I was having supper with [Yorkshire's coach] Martyn Moxon during that game to discuss being captain this year. I knew Anthony McGrath was stepping down and I didn't see anyone else who could do the job. Yorkshire is a very difficult place to captain with all the committees and politics and so I threw my hat into the ring. I only found out they didn't want me three weeks after the season ended. I heard I was getting the boot in October. I went to see the chief executive, thinking they were going to give me two years on the money they offered me at the start of the season. But it was just a case of, 'We can't offer you anything.'\" Hoggard pulls a face at the memory. \"I said, 'Fair enough,' and walked out. I'm not going to sit there and plead and beg.\" He stresses, however, that the pain of being sacked would have eased had he been given a proper farewell. \"Even [the South African] Deon Kruis, who hadn't been there that long, got a good send\u2011off. There were tears in his eyes at his last game. It would've been nice if I'd had the same chance.\" Hoggard smiles thinly when asked if he feels bitter. \"Life's too short to be bitter, pal,\" he says, a touch tartly. \"If you think about it too much you're going to get more upset, bitter and twisted. It could be the best thing that ever happened to me. I could come here and rejuvenate myself. This is a big challenge. I could have gone anywhere and bowled 25 overs a day and chewed the cud at fine leg. But I can make a difference here.\" The old ghosts have not quite been banished. Hoggard looks hurt when asked if his disappointment with England affected him even more than being discarded by Yorkshire. \"Yeah. If everything had been hunky-dory at home, and going swimmingly, I'd have coped better. But things weren't good at home and that's why it was so tough. Sarah was clinically depressed before, so the post-natal depression was a double-whammy.\" Has Sarah recovered? \"She's OK,\" Hoggard says, before pausing. \"She's getting there. But there's no quick fix. You can't take an aspirin and it buggers off. It was hard work. When things aren't going well at home and you've been dropped by England it's not the best place in the world.\" Has the Yorkshire fallout affected him similarly? \"Not any more. I was in a bad place for a while but getting back on track with Sarah was the main issue. You get kicked in the nads and you either lie down and say 'Fuck it' or you get up. I got up.\" Hoggard is too hardy to seek out sympathy. And so there is more admiration than pity in the belief that, like even more hard-edged Yorkshiremen of the past, in Brian Close at Somerset or Ray Illingworth at Leicestershire, he might emerge as an inspired leader of his adopted county. \"I hope it's the same old me,\" he says. \"But in some ways you have to change. You have to be more responsible. I'm going to have to find my own style of captaincy.\" Will he look to overcome any sense of being undervalued? \"I played 67 Tests so I can't feel undervalued. I'm England's sixth-leading wicket-taker [with 248] and I had some great games. I got 12 wickets in Johannesburg [to seal a series win in South Africa in 2004-05] and two seven-fors, against New Zealand and India. We won the Ashes [in 2005] and I got a hat\u2011trick [against West Indies in 2004]. I've enjoyed my time at the top.\" Hoggard turns away and packs up his training kit, which is all over the dressing room. The man who might have become a vet had he not discovered his dogged bowling talent while playing for Pudsey Congs as a teenager can now find smaller consolations in his cricketing life. \"I saw a live badger for the first time down here in Leicestershire last week,\" he says, looking up one last time. \"There were three of them, down in the garden, and it felt all right then. It felt good.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
