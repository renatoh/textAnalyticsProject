And ITV have stepped into the breach, snapping up his latest creation, Director's Commentary. Brydon, a frequent collaborator with Steve Coogan, has won two British Comedy Awards - one for Marion and Geoff and another for Human Remains, co-starring Julia Davis. Both shows aired to critical acclaim on BBC2. But his latest series will air on ITV after it failed to find favour with BBC bosses. \"We sent it to the BBC. Heard nothing,\" said Brydon. \"The head of comedy at ITV had wanted to do something with me for ages. So we thought we might as well send it to ITV. And they liked it. Thank God. \"I didn't really want it to go out on any really obscure channel. I'd rather just have my friends round my house to watch it.\" Brydon stars in Director's Commentary as veteran director Peter De Lane giving a DVD-style \"commentary\" over shows he has directed including 70s western Bonanza and quiz show Mr and Mrs. \"Voice stuff is one of the things I'm good at - impressions and accents and all that,\" Brydon told Heat magazine. \"So it seemed quite natural for me to try to do a show where I spoof the director's commentaries you get on DVDs and you just hear my voice talking about what you see on the screen.\" But it's not the end of Brydon's relationship with the BBC. As well as a Marion and Geoff spin-off, The Keith Barrett Show, he has teamed up with fellow Comedy Award-winners Steve Coogan and Little Britain star David Walliams to develop a new BBC sitcom set in an old people's home. Home will star Walliams and Brydon alongside Ronnie Corbett. It is being made jointly by Brydon's independent production company, Jones the Film, and Coogan's firm, Baby Cow. Director's Commentary begins on ITV1 next Wednesday, January 28. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
