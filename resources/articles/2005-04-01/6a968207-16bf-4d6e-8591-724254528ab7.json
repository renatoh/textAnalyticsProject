But now they are getting on, and Mair wants to leave the farm for a bungalow in the village. It would be worse than dying, says Defi. And that's not the only rift between them. Their son was killed in an accident long ago, and each still blames the other. Perhaps the matter will be settled when they are reunited with him in heaven. But what will they find there: the boy they remember, or a grown-up version? They talk through their hopes and fears in Meic Povey's play Like an Animal (2.15pm, Radio 4). Sian Phillips and Glyn Houston star. Elsewhere, Frontiers (9pm, Radio 4) is looking at risk. Why do some people put their lives in peril in pursuit of ever-greater thrills? In evolutionary terms, an appetite for danger seems to pay off at times of cataclysmic change, as species that take a gamble have at least a chance of surviving. Does this mean there's a \"risk-taking gene\"? Peter Evans investigates. And Performance on 3 (7.30pm, Radio 3) is celebrating physical and spiritual love, in the form of Olivier Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony. This kaleidoscopic work includes the ondes martenot, one of the first electronic instruments and the only one of its generation still used by orchestras. Cynthia Millar, who is to the ondes martenot what Rolf Harris is to the wobbleboard, joins the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Ilan Volkov. Howard Shelley is the pianist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
