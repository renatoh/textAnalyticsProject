No placards or flags advertise its location in a pebble-dashed, terraced house next to a firm selling \"competitively priced\" funeral memorials. Inside the mood has been sombre. Councillor Andy Wilson was poring over count figures and contemplating the possible extinction of the political establishment which dominated Northern Ireland for most of the 20th century. The ferry port lies at the heart of the East Antrim constituency, one of five seats lost by the UUP in the general election. The party now has only one member at Westminster while the rival Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, has nine MPs and is the fourth largest group in the Commons. Was this extraordinary upheaval a permanent realignment of hardline unionism or merely a massive protest vote against David Trimble, leader of the UUP and Nobel peace prize laureate? Mr Wilson, 35, was adamant his party would come back. \"There remains a need for a reasonable, secular pro-union party,\" he insisted. \"Some of the vote was anti-Trimble, there was a certain amount [of antagonism] on the doorstep. Everyone has their sell-by date, perhaps. But Trimble became the scapegoat and history will treat him more kindly.\" The DUP consistently targeted Mr Trimble's handling of the peace process, Mr Wilson said. \"Their message that we 'let prisoners out, destroyed the RUC and allowed terrorists into government' had an effect. It took time to explain to people that they were represented at Stormont as well.\" David Burnside, one of the ousted UUP parliamentary candidates, has proposed the party merge with the DUP to forge a more powerful, unionist alliance. Mr Wilson was appalled at the prospect. \"I would never join the DUP,\" he said. \"I have friends who are Catholics. I couldn't look them in the eye. The DUP is based on ethnic solidarity. It is a Protestant jihad; some of its members at local level have Neanderthal tendencies.\" While the DUP has stressed the more exacting terms it says it will demand from Sinn F\u00e9in before the republican movement can re-enter devolved government, there has been a gradual rebranding of the Ulster Unionist party as a broad church occupying the middle ground. A common view is that the UUP was poorly organised and Mr Trimble was blamed for failing to sustain a consensus behind the peace process. Disillusioned \"garden centre\" unionists, those more affluent supporters who backed the Good Friday agreement in 1998, it is said, conse quently declined to vote. The IRA's perceived involvement in the \u00a326m Northern Bank robbery and the killing of the Belfast man Robert McCartney was the final straw, according to this interpretation, sealing their distrust of Mr Trimble. The outgoing UUP leader, who stood down after losing his Upper Bann seat, has responded by warning that the province faces a period of dangerous political stalemate, with support polarised around the DUP on one side of the sectarian divide and Sinn F\u00e9in on the other. Unionism is in a state of flux. The two main unionist parties stood against each other right across the province at the election for the first time. The immediate challenge is to find a new leader for the UUP. The party executive has fixed on June 23 as the date when the party's 860 strong council will select Mr Trimble's successor. A temporary triumvirate of the party president, Lord Rogan, assembly member Sir Reg Empey and its sole remaining MP, Lady Sylvia Hermon, are in charge until then. Among names mentioned were Jim Nicholson, the party's MEP, David Burnside, Sir Reg Empey, Michael McGimpsey and the former MPs John Taylor and Ken Maginnis, both peers who would be caretaker leaders. Lady Sylvia Hermon, like several colleagues, has not yet declared her hand and has declined to comment. The electoral dismembering of the party has been all the more painful because this year marks the century of its foundation in 1905. Sir Reg Empey said: \"It was the government that really let David Trimble down. They allowed republicans to get away with it time after time. There's still a large section of unionism that is not prepared to be led by Ian Paisley.\" Internal division But there are fresh signs of internal division. Some have dismissed Lady Hermon as too inexperienced in the Commons and too liberal. Her constituency, North Down, lies along the southern shore of Belfast Lough and is predominantly leafy, middle class suburbia. In the local offices of the DUP, the unsuccessful challenger, Peter Weir, an assembly member, was not dismayed at being 5,000 votes short. \"We didn't even contest the seat in 2001,\" he said. \"Lady Hermon has a personal vote and that was one of the reasons she survived the great avalanche... There's been a fundamental shift here. It was not just a protest vote. The DUP is the dominant voice. You don't need a merger. The vast bulk of the unionist community are rowing in behind us.\" At UUP headquarters, in East Belfast, the party's spin doctor, Alex Benjamin, dismisses talk of the party's disintegration. \"The voters wanted to give David Trimble a bloody nose,\" he acknowledges. \"Our biggest problem was the government. We were promised full IRA decommissioning. Blair could have imposed sanctions. We were shafted.\" His one crumb of comfort is that the DUP, as the dominant unionist party, will now come under the type of political pressure which produced so many splits among Ulster Unionists. \"When it comes to peace-brokering they normally keep Paisley away from it,\" he said. \"The DUP will have the same troubles as we did.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
