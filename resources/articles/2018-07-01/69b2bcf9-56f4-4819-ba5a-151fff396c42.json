A magnificent century from Sophie Devine saw them chase down the required runs with five overs to spare, after England had earlier been bowled out for 219 thanks to the off-spinner Leigh Kasperek\u2019s first five-for in ODIs. The win came in some style, Devine smashing Katherine Brunt for six over the long-leg boundary to take her side over the line. Devine had built a solid platform up front with half-century partnerships for the second and fourth wickets with Maddy Green and Amy Satterthwaite, doing the necessary after New Zealand lost Jess Watkin in the first over. The 20-year-old had been promoted to open but the experiment soon turned sour, Brunt trapping her leg-before to leave New Zealand two for one. Brunt also chimed in with the big scalp of Satterthwaite to leave New Zealand 142 for four in the 29th over, in the process becoming England\u2019s leading wicket-taker in ODIs with 134 to her name. When the fifth wicket went down with 70 runs still needed the result was still far from certain, especially with Suzie Bates already back in the hutch, dropped down to four but failing to fulfil her brief to shore up the middle order. She lasted a mere eight balls before bottom edging a Laura Marsh delivery on to her own stumps. Devine, though, refused to be cowed, punishing Marsh over square-leg for the first six of the series and eventually bringing up her 101-ball century in the 38th over, banishing any late-innings nerves with her steely calm defences. Before this game no New Zealand batsman had reached more than 33 in this series; and while it was not all plain sailing for Devine \u2013 Kate Cross in particular inducing several false shots from her early in her innings \u2013 it was certainly a timely return to form. It had started so well for England, an air of inevitability about proceedings after the moment that Heather Knight won the toss and chose to bat, for the third time in as many matches this series. Beaumont \u2013 on her way to surpassing 600 runs in this summer\u2019s internationals \u2013 simply picked up where she had left off at Derby on Tuesday, waiting a mere five balls to pounce before driving the last ball of Holly Huddleston\u2019s first over through the covers, the first of seven perfectly placed boundaries on her way to a 61-ball half-century. Huddleston, who has been the pick of the Kiwi seam attack this series but went wicketless here, lasted only two overs up front \u2013 her second featuring consecutive no-balls \u2013 before Suzie Bates took her off. As Beaumont prospered, so did her partner Amy Jones, the pair bringing up England\u2019s second century opening stand of the series. While Jones was slower than Beaumont to get going \u2013 her first boundary not coming until the 10th over \u2013 she eventually brought up her own half-century in 63 balls. It was Kasperek who finally broke the opening partnership in the 21st over, a reverse paddle from Beaumont not quite coming off as she was caught behind. Kasperek struck again in her very next over, as Lauren Winfield \u2013 promoted to three after Sarah Taylor was rested \u2013 holed out to deep midwicket, Green taking a great diving catch. By the time she struck for the fifth and final time in the 48th over, trapping Sophie Ecclestone leg-before, England had lost their last eight wickets for 63 runs across the course of 16 overs \u2013 the tables thoroughly turned on them as New Zealand finally salvaged some pride at the end of what has been a difficult tour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
