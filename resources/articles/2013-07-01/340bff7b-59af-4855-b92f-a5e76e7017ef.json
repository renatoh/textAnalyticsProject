The manager, Simon Taylor, was disciplined by BA and apologised on his Facebook page (where he poses, clearly finding himself hilarious, with a Jim Fixed It For Me mug). Still, it's odd that Taylor even thought of doing it and at such a time. As the jibe was made, Andy Murray was the centre of attention around the world. Yet it was his mother, sitting with the other spectators, who received Taylor's slating, as if nothing else of interest was going on. There was a recent BBC documentary about Andy Murray, a bit of a puff piece, but he came across fine. So did Judy, who seemed pleasant and articulate, a world away from her public image, mainly derived from bizarre photos of her becoming agitated watching her son play. Just like her son, Judy has an unphotogenic habit of gurning at times of stress or excitement. She is also known for encouraging her son to excel. For these sins (support for her son's ambitions; not caring what her face is doing), Judy has been widely pilloried and lampooned. No other member of Murray's family or team has attracted these levels of ire. But for what \u2013 being a tennis player's proud, supportive mother? How seriously should we take this \u2013 a snide remark on a social networking site? After all, there are little belches of sexism going on all the time. Foreign secretary William Hague referred to Labour MP Cathy Jamieson as a \"stupid woman\" not once but twice, during prime minister's questions, when she dared to inquire about his intervention on behalf of a British oil firm. Whatever Hague says, his unthinking addition of \"woman\" to \"stupid\" made gender a pivotal part of the insult. Elsewhere during Wimbledon, commentator John Inverdale's bizarre aside that Marion Bartoli was \"no looker\" caused uproar, while the cameras panned tediously over wives and girlfriends every time a male player hit a ball. Even by televised sport standards, the scrutiny of women such as Murray's girlfriend, Kim Sears, continues to verge on stalkerish. At least football Wags seem to get some time off to go shopping. Women in relationships with tennis players appear to be condemned to a kind of Wag-presenteeism \u2013 constantly required to be on show, looking \"pensive\" or \"delighted\". Sears is indicative of what happens when young women are in proximity to famous men \u2013 unless they're very lucky, they are branded as eye candy with few speaking privileges. They are usually only allowed to provide visuals from a limited preordained repertoire (sexy, sweet, happy, sad, proud, disappointed, sexy again). However, even they do better than older women such as Judy Murray, who end up portrayed as a modern-day version of Lady Macbeth, only this time with added Robinson's barley water. Just as the younger woman is diminished, the older woman finds herself exaggerated, cast as the wicked queen, a plotter and a schemer, for whatever reasons can be procured or fabricated. Indeed, women such as Judy Murray give flesh to the mantra hissing in every chauvinist chump's soul: \"Behind every successful man, there is a pushy harpy, screaming in the poor sod's ear.\" Which, one supposes, explains what drove Simon Taylor to disparage Judy Murray, even as her son was winning the Wimbledon men's singles final. Just as Hague unthinkingly criticised Jamieson via her gender, Taylor just as arbitrarily attacked Judy Murray \u2026 just because he could. Ultimately, it's the randomness that strikes you \u2013 the fact that being female makes you fair game. Whatever else is going on, however momentous, some people simply can't resist sliding into the damp patch in the collective psyche that enjoys putting women down. How dare Charlie Sheen diss Nessie! Bad boy Charlie Sheen briefly visited Scotland recently in search of the Loch Ness monster. It's the \"briefly\" bit that hurts. Imagine Charlie in his Playboy mansion-themed man-den with yesterday's pants on his head, zoning out in front of the Discovery channel, suddenly declaring: \"Hey, that Loch Ness monster \u2013 I gotta finally find that dude for the good people of Scotlandshire.\" Then, tucking a switchblade behind his ear, Sheen books seats in first class, for himself and his sprawling entourage, to \"Loch Ness, goddamit!\". Going by reports, Sheen and his friends stayed near the loch and, disappointingly, behaved themselves. There were rumours of Sheen over-enthusiastically hugging a wooden replica of Nessie, but he may have thought it was Oliver Stone come to offer him his first part in a decent movie since Wall Street. Sadly, it took him only a day or so to leave, having tired of the legend and abandoning his pursuit of Britain's foremost fabled monster. This raises many deep philosophical questions. Why did Sheen so quickly tire of Nessie \u2013 are Brits just more easily pleased when it comes to mythical creatures? Must we finally accept that the most recent sightings have probably been the work of drunk computer science students messing about with novelty draught excluders and some trick photography? One is left with the unpleasant feeling that the monster has been seriously dissed. If it can't hold the likes of Sheen's attention for more than a day, then all is lost. Perhaps Scotland should retaliate by coming over all postmodern and sending Nessie over to Hollywood to look for \"mythical monster, Charlie Sheen\"? Something must be done. The Scottish Tourist Board awaits your suggestions. Nappy days are here again, unless you live in Devizes The bonny baby competition at the Devizes carnival in Wiltshire has been axed because organisers deemed it no longer \"appropriate\". They have also scrapped the carnival queen. Now local mums are to hold their own bonny baby contest and there are complaints about \"political correctness gone mad\". You could just about understand the argument for ousting the carnival queen (though the judges could have always concentrated on achievement rather than beauty). However, does anyone seriously think a baby could be objectified? Does anyone recall any childhood psychological scarring because another tot was cuter, with deeper dimples? Are babies getting upset looking at baby magazines because the baby models' thighs are thinner? \"Goo-goo. I feel oppressed by the airbrushed images of other 18-month-olds. I feel too fat to finish my rusk. Ga-ga.\" Of all stages in life, I'd have thought that babyhood was the least objectified. Moreover, bonny baby competitions are arguably the most politically correct of beauty contest \u2013 they feature girl and boy babies (you don't tend to see \"beauty king\" pageants). Perhaps Devizes should make the most of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
