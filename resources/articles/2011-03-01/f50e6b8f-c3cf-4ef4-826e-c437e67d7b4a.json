The deal meets a key German condition for increasing the eurozone safety net, however wrangling continued over other requirements. Angela Merkel was seeking concessions on corporation tax and privatisation from the Irish and Greek governments in return for easing the terms of their bailouts. The Brussels summit of the 17 countries in the eurozone was seeking to agree on a German-scripted pact on common fiscal and economic policies \u2013 Berlin's price for bankrolling a permanent eurozone bailout regime from 2013 for countries at risk of sovereign default. But the German terms for what is dubbed the \"pact for the euro\" have been fought over intensely since being unveiled last month and Merkel's blueprint has been watered down by Herman van Rompuy, the European council president, and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission. \"Agreement in principle on the Pact for the Euro, but still discussing the other elements of the package,\" Van Rompuy said in a posting on Twitter tonight. Germany, which has limits on debt written into its constitution, wanted other eurozone members to agree to some national limits to avoid a repeat of the sovereign debt crisis. It remained to be seen whether Merkel would prevail in getting a tougher new regime on other issues such as corporation tax, wage indexation and retirement ages. Merkel was said to be offering the Irish better interest rates on its \u20ac85bn (\u00a372bn) bailout in return for softening its resolve to retain low corporation tax rates. In the runup to the summit, Enda Kenny, the Irish taoiseach, ruled out any trade-off. The Germans also want the Greek government to sell state-owned land in return for lower interest rates on its bailout, a proposal rejected by Athens. Friday's summit came amid fresh market turmoil. Greece, whose debt has already suffered junk status, was downgraded another three notches by Moody's ratings agency, triggering a furore for the Athens government, while the cost of borrowing for Portugal rose to record levels. With the government in Lisbon under intense pressure to become the third eurozone country to request a bailout, it unveiled a new raft of austerity measures, taxing pensions, slashing social security and welfare payments. The terms of the pact being negotiated are in preparation for another full EU summit in two weeks, which is to decide on the European stability mechanism, the new and permanent rescue regime for the euro which is to be established in 2013. Last May, at the height of the euro crisis, the eurozone countries, with the International Monetary Fund, created a provisional \u20ac750bn fund for last-resort bailouts of countries close to default. The strongest and biggest economy in the EU, Germany is the main paymaster for the new regime, but the scheme is deeply unpopular. Merkel faces opposition within her coalition with free market liberals, has problems selling the regime to the Bundestag or parliament, and it could also cost her votes in six key regional elections this year. The pact she announced last month called for a harmonised corporation tax base in the eurozone, strongly opposed by Ireland, Estonia and Slovakia; for an end to wage indexation, ruled unacceptable by Belgium; and for moves towards common retirement ages across the eurozone, fiercely criticised in Austria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
