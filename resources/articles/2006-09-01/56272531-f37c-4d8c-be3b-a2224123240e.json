All seven believe that only a megacasino can turn around their fortunes. Most are a long way from persuading locals of the same thing. Meanwhile, convincing the panel that poorer residents will serve the drinks but not pour their own money into the slot machines is proving a tough job. Because they want wealthier punters to come from elsewhere, councils have by and large ignored the government's recommendation that the new casinos be sited in city centres and instead put forward brownfield sites. Out-of-town resorts are easier to police, they take less trade away from existing businesses and they put temptation a bus-ride away. It is hard to show that a megacasino will do more than pep up the local economy - particularly since the tax revenue goes to the Treasury rather than their own coffers - so most councils have tied their bids to more ambitious projects. Cardiff, Manchester and Sheffield want big sports centres. Newcastle hopes for a Science Quarter and a regional convention centre. Greenwich wants a theatre and a 32-floor hotel that will outlive the 2012 Olympics. It is not always clear why a megacasino is a prerequisite for these schemes: Sheffield, for instance, claims a \"synergy\" between gambling and sport, citing the sponsorship of the World Snooker Championships by an online gambling company. Only jaded Blackpool, the current favourite, seems to want the megacasino for its own sake: the council believes an all-weather gambling resort is its only hope. Unlike Greenwich, where Philip Anschutz's AEG has already begun work, Blackpool has cannily not tied its bid to any casino operator. And the fact that most MPs have tutted at Blackpool's plight during the party conferences will do its chances no harm. Whichever site hits the jackpot in December, the bidding process has uncovered a worrying flaw in the government's plans. Councils have recognised the risks of foisting a big gambling emporium on a town centre; tellingly, all seven bidders have rejected the option of hosting one of the 16 smaller casinos. The word megacasino conveys a whiff of ugly sprawl and American excess which puts the fear of God into its opponents. But they may prove the best way of handling Britain's first big bet on the gambling industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
