Adapted from a comic book and based on a hazy legend (how 300 Spartans thwarted Persian hordes), this battle epic makes no apologies for playing fast and loose with history. The result is an amped-up, stylised, skimpily clad orgy of violence. Brutally crass but perversely enjoyable, and surely a future camp classic. Catch A Fire (12A) (Phillip Noyce, 2006, Fra/UK/US/S Africa) Tim Robbins, Derek Luke. 111 mins. Luke plays a radicalised black South African in an apartheid-era dream that would be after the fact if the line between terrorist and freedom fighter weren't still contentious. Robbins is rather awkward as the bad white guy, but as ethical action thrillers go, it's better than Blood Diamond. TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) (Kevin Munroe, 2007, US) 87 mins. Pitched at a new generation of teens (and their pocket money), this latest update of the indefatigable reptilians is computer animated, celebrity voiced and sporadically dynamic. Just about worth half-shelling out for. Catch And Release (12A) (Susannah Grant, 2006, US) Jennifer Garner, Timothy Olyphant. 123 mins. After her fiance's death, Garner finds herself shacked up with his buddies (including Kevin Smith) and reeling with grief, revelations and fresh love - a lot of ground to cover, but this romcom handles itself adequately. Midnight Movies (18) (Stuart Samuels, 2005, US) 86 mins. An uncritical, if not downright backslapping, documentary on how cult movies infiltrated the mainstream, focusing on six familiar titles, from Pink Flamingos to Eraserhead. I Want Candy (15) (Stephen Surjik, 2007, UK) Tom Riley, Tom Burke, Carmen Electra. 90 mins. A couple of film students attempt to make their mark by incorporating a porn star into their college movie. Surprisingly, it's not as awful as it sounds, thanks to a lively, laddish comic tone. The Gigolos (NC) (Richard Bracewell, 2006, UK) Sacha Tarter. 91 mins. No Deuce Bigalow, this takes an Office-like comedy approach to London's male escort industry and a couple of partners-turned-rivals in particular - but doesn't find a lot to laugh about. Namaste, London (NC) (Vipul Amrutlal Shah, 2007, India) Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif. 130 mins. British-Asian girl meets Punjabi boy (or rather, she's forced to by her father) in this Indian culture-clash musical romcom. Brasileirinho (15) (Mika Kaurismaki, 2005, Bra/Fin/Swi) 90 mins. The Finn filmmaker tracks the origins of \"choro\" - the basis of almost all Brazilian music. It's specialised, but rigorous and joyous. Amazing Grace (12A) (Michael Apted, 2006, UK) Ioan Gruffudd, Romola Garai, Albert Finney. 118 mins. Some stories simply demand grandstanding speeches, simplified politics and an unimpeachably good hero fighting for what he believes in, and this makes no bones about being one of them. It's as much a teaching aid as a biopic, but you can forgive the broad treatment. Gruffudd gives it his all as persistent abolitionist William Wilberforce, and with a quality cast, a sense of humour and a reluctance to depict anything too upsetting (ie. actual slavery), it's straight, solid white man's drama. Out from Friday The Hills Have Eyes 2 Another desert outing ruined by bloodthirsty radioactive mutants. The Namesake Kal Penn plays an Indian American man trying to reconcile his two cultures. Days Of Glory Action epic following a band of north Africans fighting for France. Mr Bean's Holiday Rowan Atkinson stumbles into the Cannes film festival. Beyond Hatred French documentary on the murder of a young gay man. The Last Mimzy Gentle sci-fi revolving around a pair of gifted children. Coming soon In two weeks... Danny Boyle turns on the heat in solar sci-fi Sunshine... Rediscovered psychedelic cult movie extraordinaire El Topo... In three weeks... Oscar-winning German thriller The Lives Of Others...
