It was also, in more ways than one, an indictment of Martin Johnson and his management team, whose lack of a coherent playing philosophy and inability to free the minds of their charges have generated displays in which England have lurched from one playing extreme to another in consecutive matches. Having been unimaginative and stupefying in Scotland last week, England were so bold last night and so free of inhibition that it was as if they were not just a different team but playing a different sport. It was a dramatic switch, even allowing for significant changes in personnel, most notably the belated introduction of Chris Ashton and Ben Foden to the outside backs and the restoration of Toby Flood to fly-half. Yet an old failing remained, one that ultimately cost them victory. England set out to prove that there was more to their game than kicking, chasing and crashing into contact after one pass, and the way they started it was as if France were playing in white and England were in blue. The visitors scored a superb try through Foden after five minutes, having moved France one way and then the other through slick passing and handling and an effective clear-out at the breakdown. They created space at will with clever angles of running from Foden, Ashton and Mark Cueto, France relied on forward power and a kicking game, playing for territory and taking precious few risks. The French scrum was so dominant that England made two changes to their front row at half-time to get on the right side of Bryce Lawrence, the referee, who took a dislike to Phil Vickery's scrummaging in the Lions' first Test in South Africa last year. England, in contrast, ran from their own half time and again, even their own 22. They did so from the start and carried on when light drizzle turned to steady and then heavy rain. There were times when they needed to put boot to ball, to turn defenders and get within range of the posts, but it took the half-time interval for them to start varying their tactics. And there lies England's weakness. It is not so much a question of style with them as a reluctance to vary tactics. Even though their scrum was under such pressure that they conceded three penalties and two free-kicks which translated into nine match-defining points, they created openings, passing quickly along the line knowing that Mathieu Bastareaud liked to rush up in defence and that they could create an extra man. But what they did not do was react to the changing weather. They played as they had been prepared to, a failing of England for so long. Handling became hazardous, mistakes abounded and England were turned over in their own half. It was only at the start of the second period that they mixed up their game more, chipping into space and forcing defenders to turn on a slippery surface. Why is it that England are only able to react to changing circumstances after half-time team-talks? They will continue to trail in the Six Nations and in the world rankings until they empower, and not just embolden, the players and get rid of the teacher-pupil relationship that seems so numbingly pervasive. \"We were pragmatic today,\" Marc Li\u00e8vremont, the France coach, said. \"We were up against the pressure of the occasions, the weather and an England team which, as usual, was good against us.\" Johnson took no consolation from a performance that, in terms of intent, deserved more. He struggled to control his feelings in the media conference, having confronted the referee and the touch judge Alain Rolland as soon as the final whistle blew after a marginal call four minutes from the end when Foden's quick throw-in to Jonny Wilkinson, who found a 60-metre touch, was called for not straight on the England 22. Wilkinson had come on for the final 20 minutes when England were 12-7 down. He played at fly-half with Flood taking over from Riki Flutey at inside-centre as ambition gave way to necessity. Wilkinson had kicked France to defeat before, most notably in the 2003 and 2007 World Cup semi-finals, and when he landed a penalty from 50 metres with eight minutes to go history looked like repeating itself. \"We needed to get into position for a drop goal but couldn't,\" Johnson said. \"Despite the result, a number of players came of age today, such as Danny Care and Toby Flood, and we made the plan of the coaches work superbly at the start. Then the rain came and we carried ball and made mistakes while they played for territory, but we were far better tactically in the second half and played the game more in their territory.\" France did not score a point after the break, but as it turned out they did not have to. Their response to Foden's sixth-minute try, which was only the second time they had been behind this Six Nations, was to grind their way forward, scrummaging and mauling strongly and kicking out of hand more than they had done all tournament. Winning was all that mattered and it was England who had it all to prove. France had already won the title courtesy of Scotland's victory in Ireland a few hours before, the fourth consecutive time they had done so after a Lions tour, but it was the grand slam, and with it England's scalp, that they salivated for. France have so often reserved their worst for England and they needed to start well. Two early free-kicks gave then the position from which Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc dropped a fifth-minute goal, but England responded immediately through Foden after five other backs had all been involved in the move. Ashton, despite being a right-footer playing on the left wing (while Cueto was a left-footer playing on the right), was looking a seasoned international not a debutant, a threat every time he had the ball. Foden, running from deep, added pace to the midfield and France found themselves stretched. The rain came at the wrong time. It heightened England's scrummaging problems, which were exacerbated when Simon Shaw left the field with a recurrence of a shoulder problem after 15 minutes. Three Parra penalties gave France a 12-7 interval lead and it took 32 minutes after the break for the next points to come through Wilkinson. Flood, so effective on the move, kicked poorly but Care chipped cleverly and Ashton was twice just beaten in races to the line. It came down to the final five minutes, as it had done in the 2007 World Cup semi-final here, when six points from Wilkinson ended France's dream. England finally achieved position but James Haskell was penalised at a ruck and France held on. England have talent but they have to start thinking their way out of trouble and not having to be told what to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
