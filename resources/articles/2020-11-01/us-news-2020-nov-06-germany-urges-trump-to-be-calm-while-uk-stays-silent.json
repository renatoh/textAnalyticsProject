The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: \u201cAmerica is more than a one-man show. Anyone who continues to pour oil on the fire in a situation like this is acting irresponsibly. Now is the time to keep a cool head until an independently determined result is available.\u201d \u201cIn order for the result \u2013 which has not yet been determined \u2013 to be accepted, everyone must first show restraint. Decent losers are more important for the functioning of a democracy than radiant winners.\u201d Maas said he expected that once the election result was settled, \u201cthe USA will probably not return to the international stage with full energy for the time being\u201d, but he added: \u201cThe world needs the USA as a force for order, not as a factor of chaos.\u201d Germany is probably the leading European power with the most invested in a return to US multilateralism of the kind offered by Joe Biden. In the UK ministers continued to refuse to comment on the election, or Donald Trump\u2019s claims that it was fraudulent. The UK will face a dilemma if Trump refuses to concede defeat and Biden claims victory, since it is traditional for the UK to congratulate the victor. Britain could continue to evade the issue until all legal challenges are exhausted, or if the Republican leadership desert Trump in the face of overwhelming evidence that he has been legitimately defeated. The UK shadow justice minister, David Lammy, said: \u201cBoris Johnson and Dominic Raab\u2019s silence as Donald Trump attempts to undermine the American people\u2019s right to free and fair elections is a national disgrace. We must have the courage to stand up for democracy whoever attacks it. No exceptions.\u201d The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell expressed concern about the fraud allegations and urged the US to return to the Paris agreement on the climate crisis and the nuclear deal with Iran. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, said he had faith in the US institutions validating the result, adding that even if Biden was elected, the US and the EU \u201cwill not return to the status that prevailed before, to a kind of good old days in the transatlantic relationship. The world has moved in four years. Europe is trying to become a power unto itself, instead of relying on US support.\u201d He described the US election as \u201ca historic vote, in terms of the tension and the size of the turnout\u201d. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, declined to back Trump\u2019s fraud claims, but suggested the US would not be in a position to lecture others on democracy after this. \u201cIf things happened in Hungary, like over there, then here, I don\u2019t know, the sky would have fallen. It\u2019s unimaginable,\u201d the Hungarian leader said. Hungary has a cool relationship with the Democrats, since some of its leading foreign policy figures have been critical of the trend to authoritarianism in the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
