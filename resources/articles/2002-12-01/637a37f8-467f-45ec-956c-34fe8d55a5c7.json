Glaxo withdrew the multi-million pound package at the eleventh hour, explaining it had received 'advice' that shareholders and the media would not accept it, and to push it through would blacken the name of the company and its executives - notably chairman Sir Christopher Hogg - forever. The first question they should ask themselves is: why did it take them so long to reach such an obvious conclusion? The most junior spin doctor could have told them how it would have played in the press, while their own non-execs - specifically Sir Roger Hurn, who knows a thing or two about fat cat scandals after his experiences at Marconi and Prudential - should have alerted them to institutional shareholder sensitivity on the pay issue. Assuming that Glaxo directors are neither na\u00efve nor stupid, there has to be a more fundamental reason for the failure to spot such a gross breach of good corporate governance. This gets to the heart of the Glaxo corporate culture. While only 15 per cent of its shareholders are American, more than half its turnover and profit comes from the US. Trying to reflect this, the board has a large element of American non-executives, who see little wrong with the obscene amounts of money Garnier was going to make from his new pay deal, even though there was nothing in the corporate performance to justify such rewards. The lesson is that US and British standards of corporate governance are poles apart, and that Glaxo will have to expand its American shareholder base if it wants to get US-style pay awards through. The honest thing would be to list its shares directly in New York (rather than in ADRs, as at present) alongside London. Blank check Trinity Mirror shareholders will know before Christmas who is to be their next chief executive, replacing the unfortunate Philip Graf. The shortlist is said to be down to three, and chairman Sir Victor Blank has the difficult job of deciding whether to stay with home-grown talent or appoint an outsider. The inside applicant is - no surprise here - Joe Sinyor, currently head of the newspaper division. Sinyor wants to do the job and has the great quality of being able to get on with Mirror editor Piers Morgan, whose power and influence is growing with each gong the titles collect - despite falling sales. But the Morgan factor also gives Blank his biggest headache. The two external applicants are said to be 'quality' men with proven track records in the national press, but how will they get on with Morgan? They will need to curb his exuberance if the Mirror's financial condition is to improve, but they will also need to establish a good working relationship with him. Amec worries There are ripples of discontent below the surface at Amec, the Cheshire-based construction group that is trying to transform itself into a services company. The company has stated it wants to buy out the 46 per cent of French group SPIE it doesn't already own, which could cost it some 270 million euros (\u00a3180m). But concerned observers are worried by the delay in producing details of the planned deal, which comes up for approval at an egm early next year. Industry insiders say the delay could be something to do with rumours from North America about the financial performance of Agra, the business bought with much fanfare two years ago. ABN eyes EFM Next Saturday will see Sir Angus Grossart in the seething atmosphere of a Glasgow Old Firm game, but the head of Scotland's only indigenous investment bank, Noble Grossart, will probably be glad of the peace and quiet. Grossart provoked Edinburgh's financial community by quitting Edinburgh Fund Managers (EFM), leading to the resignation of the non-execs and the ousting of the chief executive. EFM is technically in breach of listing requirements and vulnerable to a bid. ABN Amro, with 10 per cent of EFM, is said to be favourite, but will need the help of Hermes, which has 29.9 per cent. But there is no reason to think the Edinburgh group will remain independent for long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
