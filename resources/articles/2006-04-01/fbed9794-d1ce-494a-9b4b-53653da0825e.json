They live in Los Angeles. They are married and have sustained a musical career for three Tyde albums, and before that in their indie-rock band Further. Their perkiness translates to effortlessly shimmering, breezy guitar pop. It's no surprise that the Thrills' Conor Deasy, who worships anything west coast, chips in with blissful vocals. However, Darren Rademaker is shrewd enough to know that an hour of goofing would cause some listeners to attack passers-by with a power drill, and so he adds in a melancholy note. Ironically, this proves their strongest suit. More misery next time, please."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
