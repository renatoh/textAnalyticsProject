The organisation wants skiers and boarders to think beyond black runs and vin chaud to the environmental impact they have on the slopes, and to take precautions not to damage resorts while having fun. They warn snow fans not to drop cigarettes and litter, which can take years to break down, and try not to hit trees when skiing in forested areas because that can stunt their growth - and obviously injure the skier, too. The company recommends using tour operators with green policies, and taking a train instead of flying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. If that's not enough, perhaps what'll persuade fashion-conscious winter folk is the special 'Respect the Mountain' green wristband it is selling for \u00a32 a pop, in the style of the charity bands sported by David Beckham and Thierry Henry.
