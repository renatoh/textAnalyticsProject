Books and news chain WH Smith almost doubled full-year profits, despite a fresh slowdown in sales, while Body Shop chalked up marginally lower first-half profits but improving sales. WH Smith chief executive Kate Swann has slashed costs, halted loss-making book promotions and is driving sales of greetings cards and stationery ranges, which generate high profits margins. The WH Smith group was reporting full year profits of \u00a364m, on sales of \u00a32.5bn. Last year the company lost \u00a3135m. The 669-strong retail chain contributed \u00a343m, despite a 2% dip in like-for-like sales. Ms Swann said: \"Our plan was not based on sales growth - it was based on getting the cost base of the business in good shape and changing the product mix.\" Ms Swann has doubled the range of greetings cards. Stationery sales were up 3%, while \"book sales fell by 3% as we did not repeat the previous year's unprofitable promotions\". Entertainment sales - music and film - were down 12%. WH Smith has cut the space devoted to videos and music as \"those markets are in decline\", said Ms Swann, but increased the range of DVDs. Last year Ms Swann identified \u00a330m of potential cost savings over three years and had a \u00a315m target for this year. However, the chief executive said yesterday she had already delivered savings of \u00a318m and had identified a further \u00a318m in back office functions, which will offset cost pressures from higher energy prices, rates and the minimum wage. \"You have to work hard on costs to stand still at the moment,\" she added. The dividend was raised 14% and the shares closed up 22.75p at 364p. Ms Swann said she was not anticipating any pick-up in consumer spending before Christmas or the rest of this financial year. \"There is nothing that we see that is going to change the trend. The first interest rate cut had virtually no effect.\" However, she insisted the chain was in good shape for Christmas. In the news distribution division, operating profits were marginally ahead, from \u00a335m to \u00a337m. Analyst Richard Ratner at Seymour Pierce rates the WH Smith management team and said \"reasonable profit growth should be achieved\" for the next two years. He moved the shares from hold to outperform. At Body Shop, which now has more than 2,000 outlets in 53 countries, worldwide comparative sales were ahead 4%, with the best performances coming from south-east asia, the nordic countries, Taiwan, France and Spain. The UK performed in line with group performance, up 4%. Profits were down 13% at \u00a37.1m in line with forecasts, as a result of acquiring franchise operations in Canada, Hong Kong and the Benelux countries. That change has shifted profits towards the second half of the year, as early wholesale sales have been shifted to later retail sales. Finance director Andrea Alvey said sales were moving ahead as a result of \"improving the shopping experience\", with store refurbishments and new products such as Spa Wisdom - a range of home-spa products - seasonal limited edition make-up collections and a new passion fruit bath and body range. The group has signed a deal with a franchise partner to open new stores in Jordan and Russia and is in talks with a potential franchisee for India. Sales from Body Shop at Home - its party sales unit - were ahead 10% and its online store is scheduled to start next year. The shares closed up 9.5p at 219.25p. Elsewhere on the high street Mothercare said its UK like-for-like sales were down 1% in the 28 weeks to October 8. Its international sales - which account for half group operating profit - saw sales rise 17% as a result of strong underlying growth and 29 new stores, taking the total to 247 across Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The shares closed up 6p at 313p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
