It was November 15, 1997, and the Republic of Ireland had just lost 2-1 to Belgium in Brussels, in the second-leg of the World Cup qualification play-off, to fall short of the finals. The Irish would be mere spectators at France '98. Yet Carsley, then 23 and with only three international caps to his name, also recalls his own sense of bravado. \"I remember Andy Townsend and those lads crying in the showers after the game,\" he said. \"I thought then, 'Well okay, I am going to get a chance to play in a major championships. I have nothing to worry about.'\" Carsley did go to the World Cup in 2002, where he appeared for two minutes as a substitute against Saudi Arabia but, 10 years on, he is still waiting to fulfil the dream of playing a prominent role at a major finals. The 33-year-old finds himself as the team's elder statesman - the goalkeeper Shay Given, 31, is the other survivor from the ties against Belgium - and Carsley's attitude has become rather less carefree. He has considered international retirement and refuses to look beyond the next match, every one of which, he concedes, \"is potentially my last\". Steve Staunton, the manager, has assembled a squad with a heavy accent on youth. It can boast the emerging talents of Paul McShane, Stephen Ireland and Kevin Doyle, among others, and they are forecast to challenge strongly for qualification to the World Cup in 2010. Yet Carsley has reminded them that it is imperative to seize the moment. Ireland sit third in Euro 2008 qualifying group D, three points behind the second-placed Czech Republic with four ties remaining. Their meeting against the Czechs here tonight has assumed make-or-break status, particularly for Carsley. \"Time passes you by, you haven't played [at a major championship] and you realise you can't take it for granted,\" he said. \"Hopefully it will hit home to these lads that we need to start putting performances together so we can get there. \"I have thought about retirement [at the end of the current campaign in November] but I am just going game to game now. If the next squad is announced and Stan [Staunton] thinks that he doesn't need me, I won't retire. But it is down to the manager. I am not taking it for granted that I will play for Ireland.\" The midfielder announced in the spring of 2004 that he needed to take a break from international football to concentrate on fighting for his place at Everton and his family life. Carsley was off the scene for 2\u00bd years, as Staunton initially resisted the clamour for his recall early last season. But after the debacle in Cyprus last October, Staunton turned to him for the home tie against the Czechs that finished 1-1. He has not missed a qualifier since, nor has the team tasted defeat. Their 2-2 draw against Slovakia in Bratislava on Saturday night extended their unbeaten run to nine matches and his role in defensive midfield, linking up Irish play and breaking down opponents', has been crucial. He will be asked to nullify Tomas Rosicky tonight, the Czech captain and playmaker and has called for focus and character from his team-mates. The Czechs are also under pressure with their media in mutinous mood following the uninspiring 3-0 win at San Marino on Saturday. Although Petr Cech, the Chelsea goalkeeper, broke Pavel Srnicek's international record with his 24th clean sheet, there was a distinct lack of sparkle. The coach Karel Bruckner, who gives a late fitness test to Milan Baros but is without the suspended Jan Koller, will face calls for his dismissal if his team loses tonight. Carsley and Ireland believe that they have it all to play for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
