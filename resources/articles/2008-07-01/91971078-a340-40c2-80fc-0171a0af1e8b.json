Last year, the Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, took top billing. This year it is the turn of co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who our panel judged had taken a much more high profile role in the day-to-day running of the web giant. The next highest new entry also goes to a US digital media executive - a creditable seventh place overall for the Microsoft chief executive, Steve Ballmer, who may still yet be successful in trying to forge a tie-up with Yahoo. The BBC accounts for four of the top 10 highest new entries in the top 100, including controller of fiction Jane Tranter at number 10, new BBC1 controller Jay Hunt at number 18 and BBC Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer in 24th place. Tranter, who missed out in last year's MediaGuardian 100, is the second most important person at the BBC, according to our panel, and is responsible for drama, comedy, film and acquisitions across its entire TV output. Hunt, fresh from a short-lived stint in charge of programmes at Channel Five, has it all to prove in her new role as controller of BBC1. But Damazer has nothing left to prove at Radio 4 - except maintaining the high standards he has already set - after it was named station of the year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. The three BBC executives are joined by two of the corporation's brightest on-screen stars, James Corden and Ruth Jones, a joint new entry at number 25 following the success of their acclaimed BBC3 sitcom, Gavin and Stacey. Making up the top 10 new entries are influential venture capitalist Patrick McKenna (number nine overall); Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson, bouncing back after a difficult 2007 (20); and culture secretary Andy Burnham (22). \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
