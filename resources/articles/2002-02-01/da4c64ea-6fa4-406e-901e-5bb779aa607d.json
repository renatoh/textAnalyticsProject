Typically, he claimed to have been unaffected by one of the most traumatic events in postwar American history. \"I heard the news over the radio while I was painting in my studio,\" he remembered of the day John F Kennedy died. \"I don't think I missed a stroke.\" Friends phoned, stunned. Warhol persuaded a bunch of people to have dinner at a bar on 86th Street but couldn't cheer them up. \"It seemed like no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't get away from the thing.\" Subject: Jackie Kennedy (1929-94), born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, later Jackie Onassis. She worked as a photographer before marrying ambitious Democratic politician JFK in 1953. She became the nation's most celebrated First Lady when Kennedy was elected US president in 1961. On November 21 1963 she was with Kennedy in an open car crossing Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the shots were fired that changed America's sense of itself, breeding paranoia and countless conspiracy theories. Historians have chipped away at the Kennedy myth - he was \"the most overrated president of the century\", according to one - but at his death he was aligning himself with popular movements for change in American society, proposing a civil rights bill just months before he was murdered. His funeral at Arlington National Cemetery was watched by millions on television. Distinguishing features: Jackie stands in stillness and dignity in front of a uniformed guard, both of them at attention as the body of the president is laid to rest before news photographers and television cameras. Never did Warhol take on the media image more directly. Kennedy's death was a defining moment in the birth of instant TV news, instant reaction, mass emotion; Warhol expressed scepticism about the media's insistence that everyone feel a certain way, as if grief were compulsory, the same for everyone. \"It didn't bother me that much that he was dead,\" he recalled. \"What bothered me was the way the television and radio were programming everybody to feel sad.\" Read by itself this is brutal; read alongside Warhol's Jackie paintings it's an insistence on the value of one's own emotional life. Warhol's portraits of Jackie could not be more full-throated in their sorrow because they are so obviously felt, a silent agony. Like all his paintings, they adopt the standpoint of someone flicking through magazines in a diner. Warhol has looked at the photographs of Kennedy's funeral and chanced on this one. It will not let him go. He looks at it again and again, and so must we - 20 times. This is the image among thousands that makes the tragedy real for him. It's a gentle painting, very tender. If he were the voyeur of caricature, Warhol might have chosen a violent image of Kennedy dying in the back of the car. He chose to show a more considered moment - and an explicitly national one. The uniformed soldier invites us to think that Jackie too is a soldier, a hero, taking America's suffering on herself, bearing the burden. The formality of this painting is a shock, yet it's without melodrama. Warhol waited until the feeling really did hit him. This is what makes him such a devastating witness. Inspirations and influences: Warhol was not alone among artists in mourning JFK. Robert Rauschenberg's Retroactive silkscreen collages are haunted by the murdered president. Where is it? In the exhibition Warhol at Tate Modern, London SE1, until April 1. Box office: 0870 166 8283."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
