More than 100 members of Congress, dozens of civil rights groups and at least 130,800 others have called on Miller to step down, or be fired, but the White House, and the broader Republican party, has still supported Miller after it was revealed he promoted racist fears such as a conspiracy theory about the demographic replacement of white people in America. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, who studies the history of fascism in Europe, said Miller was safe in the White House because he was the perfect combination of ideology and behind-the-scenes personality to appease Trump, an \u201cattention-hungry leader\u201d pushing far-right policies. \u201cMiller is a quiet extremist and they are the most dangerous kind,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. A series of reports released by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) last month revealed the White House aide endorsing white nationalist websites and books in emails to a writer at Breitbart and injecting that agenda into the website. The architect of many Trump administration immigration policies, Miller has a powerful influence in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), where he has helped quietly reshape US immigration policy through small bureaucratic changes, as well as big policies such as the Muslim ban, which was pushed out without undergoing the traditional review process. Miller ascended to the White House as the Republican party abandons moderate positions in favor of appealing to the fringe-right figures stacked in the presidential administration. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for Americans to get their head around this kind of dismaying idea, that those emails are positive for the people Trump wants to please,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. One of the only Republicans to criticize Miller after the email scandal was the Utah senator Mitt Romney. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear him more fully describe his involvement with that movement,\u201d Romney told HuffPost when asked about Miller\u2019s ties to white nationalism. \u201cI know the president gets to choose who\u2019s around him, but I don\u2019t think that reflects as well as it might.\u201d The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), an advocacy group for American Muslims, was one of the dozens of civil rights groups to call for Miller\u2019s resignation in the wake of the email scandal. Cair\u2019s government affairs director, Robert McCaw, said the scandal \u201cisn\u2019t an isolated incident\u201d, pointing to other White House officials with ties to white nationalism. In 2016, Trump appointed Steve Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, as White House chief strategist, despite Bannon\u2019s website being associated with efforts to preserve \u201cwhite identity\u201d and defend \u201cwestern values\u201d. Trump\u2019s former deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka was photographed wearing a medal from Vit\u00e9zi Rend, a group with historical links to Nazi Germany and the murder of Jews during the Holocaust. Gorka claimed that he only wore the medal to honour his father. Like Bannon, he no longer works in the White House. In August 2018, the speechwriter Darren Beattie stopped working at the White House after it was revealed he had spoken at a conference regularly attend by white nationalists. \u201cThat is a lot of people with anti-immigrant or white supremacist beliefs that have just flowed through this administration,\u201d McCaw said. \u201cClearly, all those have been pushed out, but Miller remains. His staying power is that the president liked his anti-immigrant programs and shares his white supremacist beliefs.\u201d This administration has also shown itself to be nearly immune to criticism. \u201cSomeone who is so overtly white supremacist and promotes such draconian, anti-immigrant, anti-person-of-color policies could not have survived in a Bush or Reagan administration,\u201d said McCaw. Miller\u2019s continued presence in the White House has led some to raise broader questions about what it means for the United States. The New Jersey Star-Ledger\u2019s editorial board wrote an opinion piece calling for Miller\u2019s resignation last week, conceding that Trump \u201cis sure to disregard this advice\u201d and adding: \u201cWhen his presidency finally comes to an end, and its political cult is deprogrammed, let\u2019s hope that basic standards of decency are revived in North America.\u201d In a segment called Fire Stephen Miller Right F**king Now, late-night television host Samantha Bee, was just as blunt: \u201cIf we can\u2019t all agree that a white supremacist has no business in the White House, then we should probably just turn out the lights on this grand American experiment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
