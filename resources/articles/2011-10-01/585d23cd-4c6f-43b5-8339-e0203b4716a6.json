But, however slight the play, the presence of Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones in this Broadway transfer proves the alchemy of acting can have a magical effect. Most people, partly because of the film starring Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, are by now familiar with the story. Miss Daisy is a testy Atlanta widow who, after a spectacular car crash, is persuaded by her son to take on a chauffeur in the person of Hoke Coleburn. And, over the momentous quarter-century from 1948 to 1973 embracing the civil rights movement and growing desegregation, we see how their rigid, professional relationship ripens into friendship. But, as Uhry makes abundantly clear, it is the quiet freemasonry of old age that binds them strongly together. To be fair, Uhry hints at the political changes American undergoes. The 1958 bombing of Atlanta's oldest synagogue for its support of racial freedom prompts Hoke to observe that African-Americans have long been exposed to bigotry. And that is balanced by a later scene in which Miss Daisy's son turns down an invitation to a Martin Luther King dinner fearing acceptance would jeopardise his business. But, although Uhry lightly sketches in the background, he leaves much out. You'd have thought, for instance, that Kennedy's use of the National Guard in 1963 to protect black Alabama students would have impinged on neighbouring Georgia. And, on the purely personal level, Uhry never follows up a crucial moment when Miss Daisy teaches the unlettered Hoke the rudiments of reading. But, whatever the play's limitations, it has long been a gold-wrapped gift for actors and so it proves here. Redgrave, in particular, demonstrates her consummate artistry. She reminds us, from the start, of the septuagenarian Miss Daisy's schoolteaching past by her habit of treating her son and employee as if they were recalcitrant pupils. And there's a piece of pure Redgrave poetry when, learning that her accusation that Hoke has pinched a tin of salmon is totally groundless, she scoops up a trashcan with a fluid balletic movement as if to suggest that her airy insouciance could act as a form of exculpation. Redgrave also evokes beautifully the gradual declension into old age. Her head slowly sinks into her shoulders, her movements acquire an arthritic carefulness and her voice becomes more papery and thin. Yet, even when lying in a geriatric ward with the tight-lipped aspect of the increasingly toothless, she still conveys Miss Daisy's willfulness: the mere mention of her daughter-in-law leads her to swivel her eyes with unflinching detestation. It is a superb piece of acting artfully matched by that of Jones. What he brings out is the quiet dignity of a man who has survived life's humiliations but knows his own worth: there is real anger in the scene when he turns on his employer for inviting him, only at the very last second, to escort her to the Martin Luther King banquet. And, in the play's dying moments, Jones spoonfeeds Miss Daisy with Thanksgving pie with the tender concern of a man similarly blasted with antiquity. Ably supported by Boyd Gaines as Miss Daisy's son and unobtrusively directed by David Esbjornson, the two star actors lend Uhry's tenuous play a transforming weight and substance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
