Kennedy was not alone in his dismay at the acquittal of Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five other defendants. The news stunned many across the country, leaving them to wonder how the government failed to convict members of an armed militia that brazenly occupied federal property and then broadcast it live on social media. \u201cI had to pull over, I was so shocked,\u201d said S Amanda Marshall, a former US attorney in Oregon who is now in private practice. \u201cI had already decided that the case was over. I thought I heard it wrong.\u201d \u201cI thought this would be a slam dunk for the government,\u201d said Tung Yin, a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, who watched the case closely. \u201cWhen the occupation was winding down, I assumed [the defendants] would all plead guilty because I didn\u2019t see any defense.\u201d One of the jurors told the Oregonian that the government had failed to prove a key part of the conspiracy charge \u2013 that the defendants had the \u201cintent\u201d to keep federal employees from doing their jobs. \u201cIt should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove \u2018conspiracy\u2019 in the count itself \u2013 and not any form of affirmation of the defense\u2019s various beliefs, actions or aspirations,\u201d Juror 4 wrote in an email to the Oregonian. \u201cThat is always the hardest thing to prove in any criminal case,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cYou almost never have direct evidence of intent. As prosecutors, we always struggle with how we\u2019re going to be able to explain intent to the jury.\u201d Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, who sat through many of the court proceedings, said she thought the prosecution\u2019s case was undermined by the fact that the US government had relied heavily on more than a dozen paid informants who were present at the refuge. Defense lawyers had repeatedly raised concerns about how those confidential informants may have influenced the actions of the defendants during the protest. \u201cThat really backfired on them,\u201d Angie said. The mother of eight also argued that the government had failed to make a case that her husband and their supporters had any \u201cintent\u201d to impede the government. Robert Salisbury, defense attorney for defendant Jeff Banta, who was one of the final holdouts at the refuge, said that the government might have been more successful if prosecutors had filed \u201ccriminal trespassing\u201d charges in state court. He noted that police officials essentially allowed the occupation to go on for weeks, during which time law enforcement stayed away and failed to order the activists to leave in any formal manner. Ammon\u2019s lawyers, for example, noted in court that he was able to leave the refuge and eat at a local Chinese food restaurant without facing law enforcement or arrest. The fact that he and others could move freely in and out of the occupation suggests that the government was not forcibly blocked from carrying out its duties at the refuge, the defense argued. \u201cThe government was very arrogant in the way they brought this whole case,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cThe jurors picked up on that.\u201d That analysis was backed up by Juror 4\u2019s email to the Oregonian, in which he wrote: \u201cThe air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us, nor was it warranted given their burden of proof.\u201d Salisbury also noted that the firearm charges were dependent on the conspiracy claims, meaning once the government failed to prove there was a coordinated effort to block federal workers, it no longer mattered whether the defendants had brought guns to the refuge. The acquittal has raised concerns that it will encourage other militias to take action against the federal government. Ryan Lenz, editor of the Hatewatch blog for the Southern Poverty Law Center, who has closely studied the Bundys and rightwing militias, said the decision could have dangerous ramifications. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. It emboldens the anti-government movement that grew as a result of the Bundys\u2019 actions.\u201d Lenz argued that the accusation that the Bundys were conspiring to impede government workers may have missed the mark. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what they intended to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not about preventing anybody from going to work. It was essentially about altering the law of the land through threats, intimidation and force.\u201d But Yin said that he thought the prosecutors\u2019 decisions were reasonable. \u201cConspiracy is actually a favorite tool of prosecutors because usually it is fairly easy to prove,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they made a mistake in charging it.\u201d Still, Yin added, the outcome should serve as a warning to prosecutors preparing for the upcoming trial over the Bundy family\u2019s 2014 armed standoff with the government over grazing fees. \u201cIt\u2019s something I would be concerned about if I was the US attorney in Nevada,\u201d he said. Peter Walker, a professor of geography at the University of Oregon, was outraged by the verdict \u2013 and by the charges prosecutors had chosen to pursue. \u201cThe community suffered horribly as a consequence of the militia presence,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe conspiracy charge captured one small part of what happened in Harney County, and the community was frustrated by that in first place. Then, to have lost on those narrow charges basically means that there was zero accountability on the occupiers for the suffering that they caused.\u201d Kennedy said the verdict was typical: \u201cWe as native people, we don\u2019t know what justice is. We never had it before. We hope for the best and expect the worst, and this time we got the worst.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
