Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and the current EU president, didn't inspire her thousand strong audience. She gave a speech which was more a trudge into the future than the glorious march she might have intended. Boring wasn't the word for it: it was duller than that, at least to British ears attuned to the routine (but sometimes shallow) histrionics of party conference platforms. She began reading, kept going to the end, and then just stopped. There was the usual canter through global concerns, the need to tackle climate change, Aids, world trade and poverty. Judging by the rather flat look in her eyes as she spoke, Ms Merkel isn't convinced that there will be action on any of them. But that's enough sneering. In its way, her speech also effectively summed up the aims this whole conference: the world needs more globalisation, but the nice kind, not the nasty. The kind that makes Botswanan farmers and Chinese factory workers richer and freer. There were some clear points, too, especially on the world trade talks, where she pleaded for flexibility from both Europe and the US, and on the European constitution. She wants it revised and revived - and she is right that the EU needs new rules to operate well. Her diagnosis, though, seems to be that EU citizens simply need things explained to them more clearly for them to say yes. She didn't allow for the possibility that at least some of those who voted no in the French and Dutch referendums did think hard about what the EU was planning - and just didn't like it. In the end what matters about Merkel is her power: unlike Tony Blair, who will close this conference on Saturday, and who will no doubt speak much more sweetly and passionately, she can follow up her words with action. Rhetoric is all very well. But reality gives even the dullest speech meaning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
