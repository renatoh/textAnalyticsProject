Knight came to the rescue again yesterday. While Hampshire confined the rest of the top seven to 65 between them, he was unbeaten at stumps with 151 out of 274 for nine. He has now made successive centuries spanning more than 13 hours, another in the eye for those who insist he is a batsman with all the restraint of an undernourished piranha. The Somerset captain Jamie Cox was the leading run-scorer on a day of five centurions. He hit a brilliant 176 as his side took control of their Division One clash with Leicestershire at Taunton. Cox shared in a first-wicket stand of 184 with youngster Matthew Wood, who weighed in with 79 before Michael Burns took over to add 52. Former captain Peter Bowler was also unbeaten on 45 as the home side closed the first day on 390 for three. Doubting Darren Thomas has become something of an unwanted obsession at Glamorgan: that anointment as the BBC's Welsh Young Personality of the Year must feel less like a decade ago than an eternity. It was those after-hour sessions, or so went the whispers: more jar-jar than jaw-jaw. All seemed back on schedule when Thomas was recalled by England A two winters ago, only for a summer-long slump to shove him back a couple of steps. Still, eight Worcestershire scalps last week hinted at renewal, and yesterday he was back on the warpath against Durham. After Martin Love (71) led the visitors to 120 for two, Thomas captured six of the last seven to finish with a championship-best seven for 33. Durham were all out for 162, but recovered some ground before the close. Four home batsmen fell in the last hour. Faced by a Gloucestershire attack lacking Mike Smith and Ian Harvey, Nottinghamshire would have hoped to gain maximum batting points. But James Averis (five for 51) and Ben Gannon denied them any as they lost their last nine wickets for 122. Then Craig Spearman closed one short of his second hundred of term."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
