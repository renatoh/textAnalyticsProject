Not so long ago you were simply a parliamentary private secretary, worthy if obscure dogsbody to a minister. Then came promotion to a junior post at Environment. After that, the election, followed gratifyingly by the offer from Tony Blair of a post as parliamentary secretary at the Home Office. A further step up the ministerial ladder, and in a key department. There would, of course, be a great deal to learn about your sensitive new responsibilities - for prisons, for children; but then there was plenty of time to learn. And then, suddenly, it was August and senior figures were off on holiday and brush fires were breaking out all over the territory. The chief inspector of prisons was damning the condition of Feltham. It fell to you to respond. Then came the explosion of wrath over Brass Eye, which you found yourself condemning as \"unspeakably sick\" even though you, along with others who also pronounced, had not actually seen it. The new Sex Offenders Act had to be launched. A council wanted a National Front march to be banned: you agreed, which was right, and easy. But a further clamour and demand for ministerial interviews arose as a high court judge ruled that the black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan should be admitted to the UK. And yesterday you found yourself in the thick of a further row, defending child curfews against critics who called them unenforceable. The Home Office is famously the department most likely to run into crises in August, particularly when the weather is hot. The minister who has to handle them does not always emerge as a star. Does it feel good to have your name on everyone's lips? Sometimes, undoubtedly. But at others, it may just possibly leave a neophyte minister feeling unspeakably sick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
