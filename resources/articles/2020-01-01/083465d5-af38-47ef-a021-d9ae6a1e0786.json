And yet Spyfall part two collapsed under the weight of its own bombast mere moments after those words were uttered. I complained last series about the seemingly pedestrian nature of this new Doctor Who compared with the more bonkers moments of Steven Moffat\u2019s pomp. Now, that feels like a case of careful what you wish for. Sure, the second instalment of Spyfall was a riot, but riots are supposed to at least be explicable. There was little of that on display here. Normally I would kick off with a recap of how they all got off the doomed aircraft, but even Graham, Ryan and Yaz were as clueless about that as the rest of us. Along the way, we took several trips to the White Light Nuns\u2019 spooky netherworld, teamed up (for no discernible reason) with computer pioneers Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage and took a trip back to the second world war where Hot Camp Master was disguising himself as a German soldier. Aside from killing his mother, Lenny Henry was barely to be seen after being hyped up as the Big Bad, though the Big Bad Tech through-line was laid on with a trowel to make up for his character\u2019s lack of screen time. Meanwhile, the \u201cfam\u201d also spent most of the episode similarly missing in action. I was left wondering what did happen this week, other than a trip to burning Gallifrey and another back in time for tea. And, other than the odd trick with a laser shoe, there was barely a Bond trope in sight either. A befuddling instalment. \u2018When does all this stop for you?\u2019 The relationship between the Doctor and the Master is among the most storied in Doctor Who lore. Once best friends at the Timelord Academy, the two took, as Thirteen puts it, \u201cvery different paths\u201d and have been each other\u2019s missing piece since the character was introduced in the 1970s. Had actor Roger Delgado survived, there were bigger plans for the Master that never came to pass. He appeared intermittently in the intervening years (played most notably by Anthony Ainley and John Simm) but never really caught fire again until s/he was rebooted and regendered as Missy, played by Michelle Gomez. Missy\u2019s story turned out to be one of redemption, but Chris Chibnall seems to be ignoring the notion of the Doctor\u2019s best frenemy having \u201cgone good\u201d. Hot Camp Master is not showing much in the way of redeeming features thus far. But there is still an awful lot to play for. Life aboard the Tardis Not much to see here officer. Too much else going on. Fear factor The White Light Nuns are named as the Kasarven \u2013 though neither Lenny Henry nor the Master seem to have any say over how to handle them after all the buildup. We don\u2019t even get much of a glimpse of their true nature \u2013 yet another crucial element to sink without enough screen time. They\u2019re probably not a long-term returning monster, I would wager. Mysteries and questions If one thing is at least clear, it\u2019s that something is afoot when it comes to the long game. We enjoyed a somewhat unexplained visit to Gallifrey to watch in horror the as the Citadel burned. Hot Camp Master admitted culpability, before expanding on his warning from last week that \u201ceverything you think you know is a lie\u201d. He then denounced the founding fathers of Gallifrey as traitors amid \u201cthe lie of the Timeless Child\u201d. Looks like we\u2019ve got ourselves a series arc, Scooby. Deeper into the vortex \u2022 The Doctor has rarely worried about wiping her/himself from the memories of temporary companions in the past, so why get so concerned about Ada here? \u2022 Ada Lovelace was quite the woman. Correctly identified by the Doctor as the founding mother of computing, Lord Byron\u2019s daughter also chalks up one of the most random historical cameos in Doctor Who history. \u2022 \u201cAll that\u2019s needed is to reformat the whole of humanity. Luckily, there\u2019s an app for that.\u201d \u2022 Seriously, am I the only person flummoxed by this entire episode? Next time According to the publicity pre-amble, episode three is a masterclass in the scares. We\u2019re just a week away from believing the hype now, as writer Ed Hime presents Orphan 55."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
