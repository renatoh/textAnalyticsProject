For Gus Fairbairn, AKA multi-instrumentalist Alabaster dePlume, the anxiety bred by that feeling is the lifeblood of his work. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of fear in our society \u2013 we are encouraged to be afraid of each other and afraid of ourselves,\u201d he says in his soft Mancunian accent. \u201cBut you can\u2019t make courage without fear. Next time you get some fear, you will have nearly everything you need. I want to create using those qualities.\u201d Speaking to Fairbairn is an exercise in disarming earnestness. He is stick-thin and effusively gestural. Each sentence is gently considered and peppered with mentions of \u201clove\u201d, \u201cencouragement\u201d and \u201cempowerment\u201d, yet this is no life-coaching session. Fairbairn offers up his credos with self-assuredness while also welcoming challenging perspectives. \u201cThe more of your personality we can have in the piece, the better,\u201d he tells me when we first speak by phone, before later meeting in person. Fairbairn\u2019s work ethic is characterised by this curiosity. He started out making \u201cjagged, noisy music\u201d with his brothers in Manchester, then in 2007 taught himself the saxophone. Five years ago, he moved to London \u201cto become a new person\u201d \u2013 Alabaster dePlume. He soon founded a tight-knit collaborative community in the east London recording complex Total Refreshment Centre, staging monthly improvisational gigs with a haphazard roster of musicians under the name Peach. He became a catalytic presence in the burgeoning London jazz scene, collaborating with drummer Sarathy Korwar and synthesiser aficionado Danalogue, among others. In February 2020, Fairbairn released a beautifully tender suite of instrumentals, To Cy &amp; Lee. Eleven tracks of Fairbairn\u2019s tentative, breathy sax melodies laid over downtempo, atmospheric chord voicings, the album is now in its third pressing, the biggest commercial success of his career. \u201cI was not expecting that with this piece of work,\u201d he says. \u201cI made them not thinking that anyone would want to listen to them. It all goes to show that no one will give you permission to make the great things that you can create. You have to do it yourself.\u201d The album is named after two adults with whom Fairbairn worked when he was a mental health support worker in Manchester; many of the songs stemmed from melodies they would sing together to relax. \u201cI wanted to celebrate Cy and Lee,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were peaceful tunes that really helped me at the time, and, when I decided to release them, I knew that we would need calm. Of course, I had no idea that there would be a global pandemic, but this record speaks to our general need for comfort. There was a lot of beautiful feeling and love that went into this.\u201d Fairbairn\u2019s latest project, Gold, continues that emotional ethos. Recorded over two weeks at the Total Refreshment Centre and employing Fairbairn\u2019s usual practice of having different bands for each session, the resulting tracks are being mixed by different producers who are free to chop up the recordings, taking cues from Chicago-based drummer Makaya McCraven\u2019s use of self-sampling. It is the perfect recorded expression of Fairbairn\u2019s unpredictable improvisatory methods. \u201cWhen you bring musicians together who don\u2019t know the music and they don\u2019t know each other, it demands that you fill the room with love in order to make them comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you fill the room with love, people can feel that this is a place of encouragement and it empowers them to do the same thing for each other.\u201d One overcast evening in late September, Fairbairn is in the control room for the final recording session, less holding court than, he says with his typical shamanic spirit, remaining \u201copen and vulnerable\u201d to allow \u201cthe music to be what it wants to be\u201d in order for the listener to \u201ccomplete\u201d it later. Before long, the musicians step into the unknown territory of improvisation and the room acquires a magnetic charge. The earthy lamentations of vocalist Donna Thompson reverberate over Fairbairn\u2019s yearning tenor sax, and a speak-singing melody morphs from player to player before meeting the hissing silence of the tape reel reaching its end. It is a bittersweet reminder of the power of live music \u2013 and one suggestion of how to process the challenges of life in 2020. \u201cThere is an invitation for me to respond to this pandemic with frustration,\u201d says Fairbairn, \u201cbut it has allowed me the time to not spend all summer playing festivals and actually focus on my own creativity. It\u2019s all gold. Go forth in the courage of your love as there is great magic there and I have no doubt that whatever we are faced with, people will continue to create. That is all we need.\u201d \u2022 Gold will be released in 2021. Alabaster dePlume\u2019s albums To Cy &amp; Lee and The Corner of a Sphere are available here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
