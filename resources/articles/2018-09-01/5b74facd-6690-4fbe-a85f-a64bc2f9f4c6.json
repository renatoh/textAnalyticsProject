Defence chiefs are to trial using drones to examine sites for chemical agents and biological threats in order to avoid exposing emergency services and personnel to risk. Among those affected by the chemical attack in Salisbury in March was DS Nick Bailey, who was hospitalised after being exposed to the nerve agent. He had attended the scene where Sergei and his daughter Yulia Skripal fell ill after being targeted, and had also visited their home where tests showed novichok had been smeared on the front door\u2019s handle. A trial involving scientists from the military research unit Porton Down has taken place at the Fire Service College in Gloucestershire, the MoD said. The project has involved the testing of a drone that can relay 3D images and detect chemical agents using a laser system. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the innovation would keep the UK at the forefront of dealing with similar attacks. \u201cFollowing the reckless nerve agent attack in Salisbury this year, we have seen the bravery and professionalism of our armed forces, emergency services and MoD scientists,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have worked tirelessly to investigate and clean up deadly contaminated areas. This project will ensure we stay at the forefront of dealing with such heinous attacks, whether on our streets or on foreign battlefields.\u201d Skripal, a former Russian agent, was successfully treated along with Yulia after being contaminated, but three months later the British woman Dawn Sturgess died after inadvertently coming into contact with the agent stored in a discarded perfume bottle. Her partner Charlie Rowley was also hospitalised. British authorities have charged Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov with conspiracy to murder the Skripals and Bailey. Prosecutors say Petrov and Boshirov work for Russian military intelligence, which the country\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has denied. In an interview last week, two men who said they were the suspects in question told Russian state television they had visited Salisbury but denied they worked for Russian military intelligence or had committed any crime. The UK prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said the interview contained \u201clies and blatant fabrications\u201d that were \u201can insult to the public\u2019s intelligence\u201d. Scotland Yard has said they believe Petrov and Boshirov to be pseudonyms and that the men\u2019s real identities have been covered up by the Russian government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
