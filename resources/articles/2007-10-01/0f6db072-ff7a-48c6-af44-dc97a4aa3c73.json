For the first time in his Formula One career, world champion Alonso has had to work with a team-mate who, at worst, is not far behind the Spaniard and, at best, has proved to be quicker. Having two drivers of equal capability should have been the ideal situation for McLaren-Mercedes but it is not one that Alonso has either expected or enjoyed any more than his team. By reacting badly on occasions, Alonso has, depending on your point of view, shown an admirable competitiveness, or a dislike of being beaten bordering on petulance. The reason for this surprising behaviour can probably be traced back to the initial contact between Alonso and the McLaren boss, Ron Dennis. It happened at Interlagos in 2005 when Alonso found himself on the podium after finishing third and securing his first world title. Dennis, representing the winning team, was surprised to find, during a brief conversation, that Alonso was interested in leaving Renault to join McLaren in 2007. A deal was concluded quickly, laying the unstable foundation for a relationship that looks like ending prematurely. Although the terms of the contract have not been made public, it is certain that Dennis will have emphasised his team's policy of providing equal equipment for both drivers, regardless of their track record or status. Alonso would not have envisaged a problem with this since, at the time, his team-mate would have been Juan Pablo Montoya, a spectacularly fast but inconsistent driver, whom Alonso would have been justified in feeling he could handle. That comfort zone would have been improved in Alonso's mind when Montoya left the team unexpectedly and it transpired Hamilton would replace the Colombian. Alonso reasoned that for all Hamilton's success during his climb to F1, the 21-year-old would be a novice in a fiercely competitive world. Alonso had made his F1 debut in 2001 with the back-of-the-grid Minardi team, his best result that year being tenth in the German Grand Prix, but he did not have a race seat the following year and spent time honing his skills as a test driver for Renault as the motor manufacturer took over what was the Benetton team. That season was a brief lull in a driving career that began at the age of three. Fernando Alonso was born in Oviedo in 1981. His father, Jose Luis, who worked as an underground explosives expert, was very keen on motor racing and built Fernando's older sister, Lorena, her own kart. Speed was not her thing, though, and three-year-old Fernando inherited the machine. Within three years he was infant champion of the Asturias region. Success bred success and in 1996 he followed up the senior Spanish title by winning the world championship. Alonso graduated to racing cars in 1999 and promptly won the Formula Nissan championship. But the next season, driving just below F1 in F3000, he found wins much harder to come by. He finished fourth in the championship, standing on the top of the podium only once that year. It was disappointing, but still enough to land a seat at Minardi in F1. After his year out testing, Alonso joined the Renault race team in 2003. It took him only 13 attempts to win his first grand prix but more than a year to do so again. Once he started winning regularly, though, he was hard to stop. He scored seven victories on his way to claiming the championship in 2005 and seven more as he secured a second title a year later. But that was it for Alonso and Renault. After all that winning with the team that had given him his big chance, he left for McLaren. True, Ron Dennis's Woking-based team looked like being more competitive in 2007 than the previous season when, amazing as it now seems, McLaren failed to win a single race. And surely Hamilton would struggle against a driver with two consecutive titles and 15 victories to his name. This reasonable assumption was scuppered by two things: Hamilton's exceptional talent and Alonso's inability to deal with the latest type of Bridgestone tyre. By becoming the sole supplier in F1, Bridgestone produced tyres that had very different characteristics from the Michelin rubber Alonso had become accustomed to when with Renault. Hamilton, on the other hand, had no preconceived ideas and adapted quickly. The Englishman also benefited from having been groomed by McLaren for several years, while Alonso had to adjust to a team operating in a more clinical and pedantic manner than the comparatively laidback regime at Renault. Alonso was immediately ill at ease, therefore, when the team naturally welcomed Hamilton's success as the junior defied all predictions by finishing on the podium in every race at the start of the season. The fact that McLaren had also feted Alonso when he won in Malaysia and Monte Carlo became irrelevant in the Spaniard's mind because Hamilton was now leading the championship. When Hamilton dared to suggest that he had been thwarted by the team in Monaco when he was the quicker of the two, Alonso resented the absence of a strong rebuke. He felt this was another indication that McLaren were not paying due deference to his position as double world champion. The notion of disrespect was hardly assuaged when Hamilton broke an agreement to allow Alonso to run first during final qualifying in Hungary. Law and order within the team disintegrated when Alonso extracted his revenge by delaying Hamilton in the pit lane. Alonso's fury with the team and Dennis in particular erupted when the driver threatened to expose emails containing sensitive information leaked to the team by a disaffected Ferrari employee. Alonso quickly withdrew his hasty remarks, but not before Dennis had gone public, thus damaging Alonso's reputation as much as that of the team. Despite having another year to run on Alonso's contract, it was impossible to see the relationship lasting beyond 2007. Indeed, had Alonso been out of the reckoning for the championship, it would have been no surprise if he had walked out then. As it was, Alonso said he could not wait until this season was over. Regardless of a feeling of persecution, Alonso has produced some drives worthy of a champion. His pass of Felipe Massa in the wet at the Nurburgring - on a day when Hamilton spun off - was typical of the controlled aggression he had shown at Renault. Equally, the Renault engineers who had worked with Alonso were not surprised when their former driver made a rare mistake and crashed in the rain in Japan. Steve Nielsen, the Renault team manager, and Alan Permane, the chief race engineer, shed an interesting and informed light on Alonso during a recent Renault F1 podcast. 'It's not normal for Fernando to make a mistake,' said Nielsen, before referring to an occasion in 2005 when Giancarlo Fisichella was actually faster in the other Renault. 'Fernando only made one mistake with us, when he crashed during the 2005 Canadian Grand Prix. Generally, he doesn't make unforced errors.' The Renault managers feel that Alonso would not have made Hamilton's mistake of pushing for victory two weeks ago in China in a race that he did not need to win. 'Lewis Hamilton didn't need to take risks,' said Permane. 'In a situation like that in the past, Fernando drove totally for the championship. His attitude was, \"You win when you can but otherwise take as many points as you need.\" 'Fernando was much more cautious than we were [when it came to deciding tactics]. He did what he needed to do. You would go to tell him to turn down his [engine] revs, only to discover that he had already done it. He would manage that side of things. We worked with each other and for each other. 'He's obviously been having a very difficult season in 2007. He went to McLaren thinking everything was going to be fantastic and rosy but it clearly hasn't turned out like that for him. I'd like to see Fernando win the title just because of all he did for us. Let's not pretend otherwise: we would not have won two championships without him. He's a nice guy.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
