He was a conservator in stone and plaster with a maker\u2019s sensibility, a historian\u2019s understanding and a curator\u2019s eye. When an old building or sculpture needed attention, he always looked to prolong its life and beauty in the fewest possible steps. As a young man he trained under the London stonemason John Bysouth. In 1979, when he was working with John\u2019s sons on the conservation of the 14th-century Bristol High Cross, which since the mid 18th century has stood in the landscape gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire, Trevor\u2019s skills were noticed by David Winfield, the National Trust\u2019s first surveyor of conservation. In the early 1980s, as the charity\u2019s newly appointed adviser for the conservation of stone and plaster, Trevor established a statuary conservation workshop on the Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire. For nearly 40 years the trust\u2019s properties, its staff and fellow advisers and consultants were beneficiaries of Trevor\u2019s guidance, based on principles such as the retention of original fabric, reversibility and conservation on a little and often basis. In 1989, working alongside trust staff and other conservation advisers, Trevor responded heroically to the ravages of the fire at Uppark, West Sussex. He masterminded the restoration of plasterwork throughout the house, ensuring that surviving fragments were incorporated into the new work, which, in turn, he advocated should be modelled freehand, so as to reflect the verve and vitality of the original. Trevor\u2019s oversight of this process brought out the skills of craftsmen who went on to establish new firms, and a renaissance of traditional craft skills followed. In the same year, Trevor was invited to advise at New York University\u2019s excavation site at Aphrodisias, the Hellenistic and Roman city in Caria, now western Anatolia in Turkey. Its ancient marble quarries, distinctive school of sculpture and wealth of epigraphical inscriptions helped connect him to the ancient world, its builders, sculptors and the materials and techniques that they used. Working with Bert Smith, now of Oxford University, over 18 seasons, and often joined by one or two colleagues from Cliveden Conservation, Trevor led projects to restore and conserve the North Agora (civic square), the Hadrianic Baths (dedicated to the emperor) and the Sebasteion Propylon (monumental temple gateway). He trained a local team to protect exposed wall heads with lime-mortar cappings \u2013 much needed on other sites across the Mediterranean \u2013 and, with the support of Turkish craftsmen whose skills he had nurtured, he conserved and displayed in the Aphrodisias Museum a large number of sculptural reliefs and statues, among them a series of late antique shield portraits, the Zoilos Frieze, the so-called Blue Horse, and 65 life-size reliefs from the Sebasteion. In 1991 Cliveden Conservation became an entity independent of the National Trust, and Trevor developed it as an international business with satellite workshops in Bath and north Norfolk. Both National Trust and private clients benefited from this expansion. Trevor worked productively alongside material scientists including John Stewart, a specialist in historic lime mortars, and Mike Schwar, with whom he developed a service to identify and analyse natural stones and mortars used in historic buildings. His talent, authority and affability made him popular with fellow professionals \u2013 conservators, curators, architects and craftsmen \u2013 and private and institutional owners of historic buildings. Born in Herne Bay, Kent, Trevor was the son of Peter, who ran the family printing firm, AJ Proudfoot and Son, and his wife, Miriam (nee Stopps), a hairdresser. He was educated at Vernon Holme school, Canterbury, and Kent College before undertaking a foundation year at Exeter School of Art. He abandoned his subsequent studies at Hull College of Art to join his future wife, Hannah Firmin, in London; they married in 1980. A gifted athlete, Trevor played rugby well into his 50s. He had an incisive mind coupled with an irreverent charm that masked a seriousness of purpose. He and Hannah had two sons, Lewis and Dorian; they divorced in 1997. In 2002 he married Laura Hebert, and they had a daughter, Emily; they divorced in 2007. He is survived by these three children; by another daughter, Sophie, from a relationship with Julie Marsden; and by three sisters. \u2022 Trevor James Proudfoot, stonemason and conservator, born 10 July 1954; died 12 September 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
