So despite drawing a tough world group play-off pairing yesterday with Croatia, ranked No3 in the world and the cup winners in 2005, he was eager to stress the advantage of its being a home tie. \"We might have been drawn away to Chile on clay - and a lot can happen between now and September,\" said Lloyd. Indeed, while Croatia are superficially considerably stronger, with Ivan Ljubicic ranked No8 in the world and Mario Ancic No13, this is by no means the whole story. Ljubicic has signalled his intentions of quitting Davis Cup tennis at the end of this year, believing it to be detrimental to his singles career, while Ancic is suffering from glandular fever, a debilitating illness that can be extremely difficult to shake off. It has not been decided where or on what surface the tie will be played. The National Indoor Arena and the NEC in Birmingham are booked while Lloyd is leaning towards playing outdoors. Ultimately it will depend on Andy Murray's preference, with the possibility of clay not being ruled out. The British camp was high on optimism after their 4-1 zonal victory over the Netherlands last weekend, which sent them through to a world group play-off where the winner will compete for the trophy proper next year. \"Andy Murray is improving all the time, his brother Jamie proved on his debut that he has the ability and nerve to play top doubles and Tim Henman underlined his commitment,\" said Lloyd. \"The only downer was Greg Rusedski's retirement.\" Rusedski's exit prompted a rallying call from Lloyd to those British players currently outside the world top 100, in other words everybody other than Murray and Henman, to step up to the challenge. \"There are no ifs or buts now and those [players such as] Alex Bogdanovic, Richard Bloomfield and Jamie Baker have to raise their game and speed things up over the next five months. The really hungry ones have the chance to fill Greg's shoes but they have to increase the intensity of their play and work extra hard to improve their physical fitness. Above all they have to believe they can make the jump.\" This message has been banged home ad infinitum to the fringe players by Lloyd and the team's coach, Peter Lundgren. \"These guys have to get in way better shape,\" was Lloyd's stark message. \"It is something Henman and Rusedski have consistently preached during the past decade although it has been only Andy Murray who has made the breakthrough, taking on board the necessity to train at a level way beyond anything he undertook at junior or Challenger level.\" Lloyd added: \"Our current top junior, Dan Evans, has exciting ability but his work ethic just has to improve. He may only be 16 but players are breaking through at that sort of age these days.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
