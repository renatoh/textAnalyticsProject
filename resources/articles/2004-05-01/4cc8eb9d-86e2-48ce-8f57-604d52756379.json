Yet again they have fallen foul of his hunger for runs, and yesterday could only stand and watch as he continued from his overnight 183 to 262, including 35 fours and three sixes. He and Ben Smith (187) notched up 417, the highest partnership for any wicket in more than a century at New Road. Facing Worcestershire's 619 for six, Gloucestershire were 511 runs behind at the close, with only four wickets left. The forgotten Gareth Batty grabbed three wickets. Down in the Second Division, Somerset's Andy Caddick was sending a smoke signal to England's selectors (presuming they bother with scorecards from the County Ground). He finished with six for 92 with Chris Bassano's 83 helping Derbyshire to 315 for nine. At Chester-le-Street, Glamorgan's Mike Powell walloped Durham on his way to the fastest championship century of the year, off 90 balls. The nervous Pallav Kumar took three wickets on his debut, but Durham lost two wickets in the 2.3 overs before stumps. It was a long, sweaty day for Essex as Leicestershire notched up 390 for six on a friendly Chelmsford pitch thanks largely to Brad Hodge's third championship century of the season. He finished unbeaten on 184, with 24 fours under his belt. Darren Gough and Danish Kaneria took a couple of wickets each."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
