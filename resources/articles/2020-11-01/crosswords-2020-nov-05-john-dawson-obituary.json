His clues as \u201cChifonie\u201d were typically short and effective; to take some recent examples: \u201cBriefly prince and his queen play around (9)\u201d (philander via \u201cPhil and ER\u201d) and \u201cDodgy dealers land in war zone (11)\u201d (an anagram giving Dardanelles). John was born in Washington, County Durham, the only child of John Dawson, chief electrician in an ordnance factory, and Rose (nee Gardner), who died when John was an infant. He attended Washington Grammar school, which he walked to with his friend Bryan Ferry, of whom he later quipped: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t sing then, either.\u201d He spent his spare boyhood time travelling around the north of England for ballroom-dancing competitions, but gave this up when he became a student at Nottingham University. He had been his school\u2019s chemistry monitor, causing the odd explosion, and read chemical engineering between 1964 and 1968. As an undergraduate John discovered early music, a lifelong passion. He had many jobs, including as a librarian and bookseller, and it was while working as a design engineer in the chemical industry that, along with other lab staff and the tea lady, he developed a habit of attempting the Telegraph crossword. He soon converted to the Guardian, particularly the accessible puzzles from Alec Robins (Custos). His first Chifonie puzzle, published in 1994, was characterised by its clarity and wit, and the following year John also appeared in the Financial Times as Armonie; both Chifonie and Armonie are names for the hurdy-gurdy. By then he had arranged for himself a kind of early semi-retirement in the Lake District, where he volunteered as a Samaritan and counsellor, spent much time hillwalking, and created a website of Lake District walks at lakedistrictwalks.com. He supported himself financially by driving a truck in a warehouse and, to a lesser extent, by setting crosswords. Having lived a relatively solitary life into his 60s, in 2013 John met Katharine Davis, a retired lecturer in education and a ballroom dancer who shared his aim of \u201cwanting to improve rather than to dance just for fun\u201d. They became partners both on and off the dancefloor, practising together at the Blackpool Tower and, over the course of the last six years or so, travelling around the country for competitions in the National League.
