Up to 2,000 workers at Her Majesty\u2019s Passport Office (HMPO) are to be asked to be available to go back in to work, with plans to have 500 people in offices at any one time, according to the BBC. The Home Office said it was adhering to Public Health England\u2019s guidance by maintaining social distancing at passport offices and added there was no advice saying that you should only go to work if you are an \u201cessential\u201d or \u201ckey\u201d worker. On a conference call on Tuesday, staff were told by the Home Office deputy scientific adviser, Rupert Shute, that 80% of people would get Covid-19 in the end. According to a leaked transcript of a Zoom meeting seen by the BBC, Shute said: \u201cYou are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it. \u201cWe are working on the assessment that 80% of us, if we haven\u2019t already, will get the virus.\u201d He added: \u201cWe cannot hide away from it forever.\u201d This mirrored earlier government briefings, but the position was overtaken when computer modelling suggested a lockdown would be needed to reduce infections. Myrtle Lloyd, chief operating officer at the Passport Office, was also on the call. She reportedly told staff the guidance did not mean they \u201cshould stay at home instead of delivering critical services\u201d. \u201cWhat is also critical for us as a business is to have a manageable level of work in the system, so that when we start our recovery we are not overwhelmed by our demands,\u201d she reportedly said. Downing Street backed up the Home Office\u2019s decision that the Passport Office was \u201cadhering to public health advice\u201d but appeared to contradict the view of the department\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser that people should not seek to hide away from the virus. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe government\u2019s focus is on stopping the spread of the disease to protect the health service. I think you\u2019ve heard on a daily basis from the chief scientific and medical officers they have been very, very clear on the need for people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d He gave no view on whether the government agrees that 80% of the public will eventually contract coronavirus. The Public and Commercial Services union raised concerns about the reports, and said it had been pressing managers across the civil service to close offices so people could work from home. Its general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: \u201cIt is absolutely scandalous that Her Majesty\u2019s Passport Office are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports. \u201cThe cavalier approach to our members\u2019 health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-19. We have already had members die as a result of contracting coronavirus, and pressured civil service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home. \u201cFor the deputy chief scientific adviser at the Home Office to suggest that going into work does not put you at greater risk of contracting corona is extremely irresponsible and totally contradicts current government guidance. Processing passports is not critical work while we are in lockdown and international travel is practically non-existent due to the corona pandemic.\u201d A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe. \u201cIt continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a significant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work. \u201cIt was made clear in the meeting that the government\u2019s priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d The Home Office added that government advice had been clear that people may travel for work purposes, if they could not work from home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
