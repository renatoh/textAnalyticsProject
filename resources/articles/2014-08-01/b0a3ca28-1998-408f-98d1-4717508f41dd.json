Construction and capital expenditure data released this week shows that the end of the mining investment boom has well and truly come, while the non-mining sectors struggle to take up the running. The view of how Australia\u2019s economy will perform in the future also received stark attention in a report this week from the RBA which showed just how valuable the mining boom has been. The clearest signal of the end of the mining investment boom comes via the quarterly private capital expenditure figures. Those released on Thursday showed capital expenditure in the mining industry \u2013 which includes the investment in buildings and structures and in equipment, plant and machinery \u2013 fell 10.9% in the past year (in trend terms). Manufacturing also continued to decline, by 6.9% in the past year, but this was offset by the 4.9% growth in investment in \u201cother industries\u201d: But while the growth in the \u201cother sector\u201d \u2013 that which incorporates the construction industry and the massive services sectors of Australia \u2013 looks to be improving, it remains well below the mining sector for total investment: In essence, the capital expenditure figures were a bit like watching a new episode of The Simpsons \u2013 it\u2019s not quite as bad as you expect, but it is nowhere as good as it used to be. The expectation for mining investment for 2014-15 is 1.5% higher than it was three months ago, and the \u201cother industries\u201d sector has now grown in trend terms for five quarters in a row \u2013 its best run since 2006. So the transition is occurring, but it is slow, as shown by the seven consecutive quarters of negative growth for all capital expenditure: The end of the mining boom and the transition to a different economy was also highlighted by construction data released on Wednesday. The data is not broken down by industry, but we can get some idea of what is going on by looking at the growth (or lack of it) by type of construction. Large projects involve a lot of \u201cengineering\u201d construction, whereas other aspects, such as building a home or office block, come under the category of \u201cbuilding\u201d construction. Engineering construction over the past year fell by 6.5% in trend terms while building construction rose by 6.5%. The big driver of building construction was residential buildings, up by 9.9%, the biggest annual rise since the stimulus measures during the GFC saw residential building construction rise 13.3% in the 12 months to September 2010. But while this would suggest growth in building construction is cancelling out the decline in engineering construction, engineering construction is worth about $30bn, compared with $22bn for buildings, so there was an overall decline in construction of 1.5%. When we break it down by states, we see the real impact of the mining boom\u2019s end. Annual growth of construction in the mining states of WA, QLD and the Northern Territory fell 3.1% on the past year, compared with growth of 0.5% in the other states. Prior to the most recent boom in 2010, the largest share of national construction occurred in the non-mining states; now, about $5bn more construction each quarter is in the mining states. But if the decline in mining capital investment continues, this may be reversed. The drop in capital investment was partially picked up by the boom in mining exports. March GDP figures show exports grew by 10% and the mining industry contributed a pretty sizeable 1.1 percentage points to annual GDP growth \u2013 almost double the 0.6 percentage points contribution of the finance and insurance industry. But for the GDP figures expected next week, export growth seems to have come off the boil. The preliminary estimates released by the ABS on Wednesday suggest exports of metal ores and minerals were down $2,857m in the June quarter, a drop of 11%. Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens last week said he was expecting a quarter of lower exports and a period of more subdued consumer demand, and then commented, \u201cthe real question is: what will it be after that? We do not know, of course\u201d. The hope is that the mining export boom will take off, and bring with it strong growth but Stevens does not seem ready to bet the farm on when, or perhaps even if, this will occur. And if it doesn\u2019t, the worry is whether the non-mining industries be able to take up the slack. What we do know is the big impact the mining boom had on Australia\u2019s economy. On Monday, the RBA published a research paper which found that the mining boom from 2002 onwards added 13% to real per capita household disposable income. Part of this increase was through the increased prices we received for our exports and the relative decline in prices we paid for our imports. This higher \u201cpurchasing power\u201d boosted our consumption of cars (30% higher than it would have been), household durables \u2013 such as whitegoods (25%), food (20%) and communications (8%). The report also suggests that, without the mining boom, Australia\u2019s unemployment rate would have risen by about 0.75 more percentage points during the GFC, and in 2013 unemployment would have risen to about 6.7% rather than averaging 5.5%. The report suggests manufacturing output in 2013 was 5% lower than it would have been without the mining boom. And the agriculture industry was hurt the most by higher export prices but didn\u2019t benefit much from increased demand: What is worth noting is that by 2025 the report suggests manufacturing output will have fallen by another 15%, and the construction industry\u2019s output is expected to drop dramatically over the next three to four years in line with falls in mining investment. The report shows that while the mining boom did produce swings and roundabouts (such as higher rental prices) overall it was of strong benefit to the Australian economy. But as we now experience the decline in mining investment, a still-high dollar, and we wait for the mining \u201cexport boom\u201d to produce strong consistent growth but less employment, we, like Glenn Stevens, are left to wonder, \u201cWhat will it be after that?\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
