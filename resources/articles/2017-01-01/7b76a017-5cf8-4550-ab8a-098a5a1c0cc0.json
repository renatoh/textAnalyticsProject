One album and three mixtapes, including the one with his fellow ATLien, Future, saw him outwork the cadre of younger rappers, such as 21 Savage, who appeared while he was behind bars. When he came out of prison, Mane seemed like a changed man. He was sober, had a new physique and was smiling. Gone was the man who reportedly brought guns to interviews. But here, on his loosely themed Christmas album, his rap persona as a brazen bizarro drug dealer is still in tact. He turns Jingle Bells into a track about shifting kilos of the white stuff, while riding through the snow \u201cwith an extendo and an AK\u201d. But this is more than just a rap re-up of murder ballads posing as a Christmas album. The guest appearances from R&amp;B heart-throb Bryson Tiller (on Drove U Crazy), Kanye West protege Travis Scott (Last Time), and Drake (Both), show the new, streamlined Gucci has one eye on a wider audience. These are mostly successful, with Gucci\u2019s one-note delivery providing ballast for the crooning of Tiller, the emo-rap of Drake and the Auto-Tuned oddness of Scott. But Gucci is at his best when solo, on Yet and Nonchalant for example, where he delivers the brand of trap music he pioneered and which so many have tried to imitate. It\u2019s not anything world-beating or different, but as Skepta\u2019s success shows, sometimes it takes a while for people to catch up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
