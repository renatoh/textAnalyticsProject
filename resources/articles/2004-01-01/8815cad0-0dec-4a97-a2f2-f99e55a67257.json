We asked five former World Cup skiers, and one TV presenter, for their choice. Steve Podborski, Canada The only non-European male to win the World Cup downhill title (1982) One of the legendary \"Crazy Canucks\" who first challenged the traditional Alpine countries on the downhill circuit in the 1970s. When Podborski retired from ski racing, he moved from Toronto to make a new home in Whistler , British Columbia. One of the members of the team that helped win the bid for the Olympic Winter Games in 2010, Steve grabs his snowboard (yes, he has swapped allegiance) when he gets time, and does not have far to go to put a smile on his face. \"I'd rip off a few runs off Spanky's Ladder in Ruby Bowl, in 20 to 30cm of fresh powder,\" he says. \"The run has several different lines, from the wide open bowl to tight trees. And it is in the ski area and lift serviced.\" Getting there: Ski Safari (01273 223680) offers 10 days room-only at Glaciers Reach in February or March (excl half-term) from \u00a3865pp including BA flights and transfers. Further information: whistlerblackomb.com. Erik Haker, Norway Leading World Cup racer in the 1970s. One of the most efficient and technically perfect skiers on the World Cup circuit. Having travelled to many resorts during his illustrious career, Haker paused while he considered the options and then said: \" Kitzb\u00fchel is the place I would go. It has that exceptional atmosphere and the village centre is just so pretty.\" Which goes to show that, for many, there is more to skiing that just unlimited miles of wide pistes. \"Kitzb\u00fchel has a special magic that is tough to find anywhere else.\" Getting there: Thomson Ski (0870 6061470, thomson-ski.co.uk) offers one week all-inclusive at the Hotel J\u00e4gerwirt from \u00a3515pp. Further information: kitzbuhel.at Graham Bell, Great Britain Five times Olympian (1984-1998), now a presenter of BBC TV's Ski Sunday. Graham was the performance director for the British ski and snowboard teams at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2002. \"My ideal day would have to be in Alaska, heli-skiing at Valdez [one of the ultimate challenges for any skier]. The slopes are the steepest, and there is the most freedom a skier could enjoy.\" Getting there: Flights to Anchorage are available through opodo.co.uk from \u00a31,436.90 on Continental Airlines. Then connect to Valdez with Era Airlines (eraaviation.com). Valdez Heli Ski Guides (valdezheliskiguides.com) from $675 a day. Further information: valdezalaska.org. Ken Read, Canada Winner of the Lauberhorn and the Hahnenkamm World Cup downhills in 1980. The second of the famous four \"Crazy Canucks\", Ken is now president of the Alpine Canada Alpin, the Canadian Ski Association. So, not surprisingly, he favours the pistes close to his home of Calgary. \"I'd choose Lake Louise . Why? Because it's only 14 minutes to double-black diamond excess; high-speed cruising down the men's Olympic downhill; fantastic scenery, even if I've seen it a thousand times; and incredible dining at the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise or Post Hotel. \"Sorry to be a 'homer', but when you have the assets right on your doorstep, why go elsewhere?\" Getting there: Trailfinders Ski North America (0845 0505900, trailfinders.com) offers one week room-only at the Lake Louise Inn from \u00a3699pp for travel from February 4 to March 31, including flights via Chicago to Calgray and transfers.

Ingemar Stenmark, Sweden Winner of 86 World Cup races. Undoubtedly the best technical skier to hit the slopes, the Swede dominated the World Cup scene in the 1970s. A genius between slalom gates, Stenmark developed his skills on a small hill close to the Arctic Circle at Tarnaby, but was swift in pronouncing that \"a day in Vail would be great\". He smiled as he imagined the smooth, long turns he would carve in the expansive back bowls. Then swiftly added the caveat: \"If the area could be closed for that day, that would be good.\" Getting there: Ski Independence (0870 5550555, ski-i.com) offers one week room-only at the Evergreen Lodge from \u00a3793pp based on two sharing, including flights and transfers. Further information: vail.comvail.com. Nick Fellows Channel 4 ski presenter. Travelling around the Alps each week reporting on the World Cup races does not leave much time to actually enjoy the mountains, so Nick's first choice would be to head to St Moritz, \"as the quality of service is excellent\". \"I would hire a guide to take me to the best off-piste, so I could switch off and let him do all the thinking. That would be the only way I could have a real break.\" The Swiss resort is more renowned for its fur coats than its radical skiing, which has the advantage that when the fresh snow falls, it is not tracked out by 9am. Getting there: Inghams offers a week's half-board at Badrutt's Palace from \u00a31,588 or the more realistically priced Hotel Monopol from \u00a3636 per week.
