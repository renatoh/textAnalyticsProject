If you haven't heard of Burwarton, that's scarcely surprising. This isn't one of the blockbuster week-long agricultural shows. Burwarton itself is little more than an incident on the tortuous road between Bridgnorth and Ludlow. You might note, passing through, the imposing gates of a great estate - Burwarton Hall, home of the Viscounts Boyne - and a good-looking pub, the Boyne Arms, and that's about it. There's a friendly informality about the proceedings here which comes from the fact that the organisation is local and voluntary. The only paid hand is the secretary of the Burwarton and District Agricultural Society, which stages it every year. These occasions began in 1891. There was no show in 1914 because of the war and no shows thereafter, mainly because so many young men had failed to come home. It didn't revive until 1947. Foot and mouth ruled it out in a couple of subsequent years, and in 1971 it was cancelled amid fears that it might not survive. Yet this year the organisers aimed to get 20,000 people, from far beyond the bounds of the county, and in Thursday's sunshine they were confident they had made it. Like all agricultural shows, it's mainly about the animals - and owners - submitting themselves for judgment. Heavy horses are being assessed, and cows in calf or with calf at foot, and pedigree bulls born on or after January 1 2005, and steers, any age (one of which I see bears the name: Spank Me Again); and ram lambs untrimmed, born in 2006, and even (for this is a cradle-to-grave affair) a combined live/dead lamb carcass competition. Judges in the top classes can nowadays explain over the public address system just why they have made their choices. All good institutions have some kind of private language, and outsiders like me may find the reasoning a little elusive: here's a cow, for instance, which seems to have clinched it, unless I misheard, partly because of \"the way she handled her leg,\" which put her ahead of the \"powerful\" cow that came second. Lower down the competitive scale, on the pitch of the Shropshire Goatkeepers' Society, thronged by eager children delighted at the displays of goatly balkiness and insubordination, there is no public explanation, but the scrutiny's just as rigorous. Watching one of the arbiters here, a massive man with a long white beard and a big black hat, it's almost as if they'd turned for judgment to some Old Testament prophet. The winning goat celebrates victory by crawling under the belly of one of the runners-up. Some of the livestock entries at Burwarton come from places as distant as Norfolk and Sussex; there are judges from Dorset and Derbyshire, and even one from Northumberland (for the watercolours, in the crafts division). It may be a sign of the standards they set that an entry which had won the supreme prize at the Royal Welsh Show was placed only second in this one. But it isn't all about animals - fortunately for my three-year-old grandson, a huge Thomas fan, who, asked what animals he was looking forward to seeing, replied without hesitation: \"The engines.\" There are engines here too, some new and gleaming, some weathered by years of service. My favourite was a big pink threshing and baling machine, all busy pulleys and whirring wheels and self-important pushing devices - though it still seemed to need a man up top with a pitchfork. Then there are all the events in the ring, from grand parades and showjumping to falconry; and the tents where more domestic competitions are judged, with prizes for the finest cabbage, the longest carrot, and the best toy made by a child from scrap metal. The judges' comments are available here too, but in writing. They are usually kind, but firm. A teddy bear has been found to require \"just a little more stuffing in the head\"; a little mouse is \"lovely\", but \"whiskers would have been the finishing touch\". Elsewhere there are impressive ranges of food from local producers. This is one of the features most expanded over the years: another is the lines of trade stalls seeking to sell you anything from the most advanced tractor or car to practical clothes and hats. And perhaps best of all, Burwarton is a place where many regular visitors find they can hardly go 50 yards without bumping into friends they perhaps haven't seen since last year. In a book called Notes Towards the Definition of Culture, TS Eliot tried to categorise the essence of English culture, listing Derby Day, Henley Regatta, Cowes, the 12th of August, a cup final, the dog races, the pin table, the dartboard, Wensleydale cheese, boiled cabbage cut into sections, beetroot in vinegar, 19th century Gothic churches and the music of Elgar. He'd have to change that quite a bit now: no doubt Tesco would need to be there, and the Notting Hill Carnival, and perhaps, I'm afraid, Big Brother. But I think the Burwarton show, and occasions like it up and down Britain, deserve a place too. As I say, you're too late for this year, but look on the bright side: you've now been given 51 weeks' notice of Burwarton 2007.
