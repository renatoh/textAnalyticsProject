Recently voted the second best female player on the planet in a Guardian poll, Sam Kerr has enjoyed a meteoric rise in recent years, winning four consecutive golden boot awards across two continents. But for almost half her 25 years, a future as a Ballon d\u2019Or nominee never looked remotely likely. \u201cI think I just have an AFL brain,\u201d Kerr tells Guardian Australia on the eve of the World Cup in France. \u201cEven now I haven\u2019t been home for seven seasons but I still know all the players\u2019 names. I don\u2019t know how I remember that when I couldn\u2019t even remember a maths test, but like that [snaps fingers], I can remember an AFL stat.\u201d The trademark somersault goal celebration that helped make Kerr a global brand ambassador might be showy, but off the pitch the quietly-spoken West Australian is less brash, in her manner and in her walk. A notorious joker inside the Matildas squad, Kerr has the ambling gait of the tomboy, the girl who played for years in boys\u2019 Australian rules football teams, with an open smile and the self-deprecating air of one keenly aware of that pervasive Australian trait, the tall poppy syndrome. To understand how Kerr nearly never became Matildas captain is to understand the twin pillars in her life: family and home. Born near the mouth of Western Australia\u2019s Swan River, East Fremantle is the place Kerr will always carry with her. Watching the pelicans, and occasionally dolphins, glide up the Swan with only the big red cranes across the way in Port Fremantle breaking the summery idyll, it\u2019s a quintessentially Sam Kerr place. And it\u2019s a place steeped in AFL history. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s ingrained in you, you grow up with it, so I didn\u2019t know any different,\u201d says Kerr, whose brother Daniel played for West Coast Eagles in the AFL. \u201cI was always playing footy, my dad played, my brother played.\u201d While Donald Bradman spent thousands of hours as a child honing his technique hitting a golf ball against a backyard water tank with a stump, for Kerr it was a skillset completely unrelated to football that captured her early imagination. \u201cEven before Daniel played, growing up it was how far can you handball a ball into a bucket, it was always a competition, snapping a ball round the hallway at home \u2013 it was just part of what we did,\u201d she says. \u201cMy first sporting hero was Ashley Sampi. I don\u2019t know if you know him, he was a young Indigenous guy at the time, he was electric. He used to take screamers all the time, up on people\u2019s backs, he\u2019d take off from the back half and run all the way to the forward 50. He was a gun and I just used to love him.\u201d While a young Cristiano Ronaldo strapped weights to his calves to improve his foot-speed, Kerr tells of hours spent attempting to replicate some of Sampi\u2019s famous speccies \u2013 bouncing up and off fitness balls to pluck imaginary marks from the air, to the roar of imaginary fans. Kerr\u2019s mother, Roxanne, and father, Roger, were stalwarts of the local footy club, Melville Junior. Kerr tells of school days followed by hurried car trips down the road to practice for her and her three siblings \u2013 a regimen that became instinctive, as natural as eating or sleeping. The love for AFL began with her dad, somewhat of a trailblazer himself \u2013 a Calcutta-born convert to a game that was completely alien. A quick learner, Roger won his first WAFL premiership at 25 as part of a 109-game career across two states. Not that it was an easy path in the racially na\u00efve Australia of the 1980s. \u201cMy nanna has a Record [AFL match day program] where the title is: \u2018Kerr serves curry\u2019, which you know, is hilarious,\u201d Kerr recalls dryly. \u201cMy dad was obviously good, he didn\u2019t deal with a lot of racism, but I think it was tough back then for dark-skin players in the league. But him being Indian he kind of got away with not being racially targeted.\u201d It\u2019s a motif that reoccurs in the Kerr family story \u2013 a young Anglo-Indian determined to make his mark in a foreign land, meeting any rebuffs with increased determination. And it was one such dead-end that drastically altered Kerr\u2019s future. A star hiding in boy\u2019s teams as the only girl found her path ending \u2013 the physical differences were becoming too pronounced, the game too rough, and eventually there was simply no team for the then 12-year-old to join. \u201cBeing taken away from footy really sucked,\u201d she says. \u201cI was very good at it, I had good hand-eye co-ordination, my family was really embedded in the club, my brother played \u2013 everything was just easy for me. It hurt going from one of the better players, one of the most popular players. I just went from being at the top of my game, as much as you can as a kid, to going to the bottom moving to football. I didn\u2019t know the rules, I didn\u2019t know offside, I didn\u2019t understand why no one would pass me the ball.\u201d More than just leaving AFL, it was a move away from the community in which the Kerr family had ensconced themselves and found inclusion. The mutual family friends from the club, the footy chat and backyard kickabouts \u2013 like so many Australian families the very fabric of their social existence was anchored in footy. \u201cIt was challenging, my parents didn\u2019t really understand football, my family didn\u2019t really get the rules, so for them it was hard to come watch because they thought it was boring, which would frustrate me.\u201d Even half-a-lifetime later that frustration flashes in Kerr\u2019s eyes \u2013 but it quickly cools into a steely set look. She met setback by knuckling down. In her first season in football she was by her own admission \u201ctotal crap\u201d, scoring just a few goals. Again the self-deprecation is abundant \u2013 state honours followed shortly, and just three years later Kerr became the youngest scorer in the W-League, was voted the players\u2019 player of the year and made her national team debut, aged just 15 years and 150 days. Still, the round-ball game failed to take root inside her heart. \u201cI was always just doing it at the start because I was good enough, I never really loved it,\u201d she says. \u201cI always said when I was a kid I\u2019d be retired by 21, which is insane. But that was just my plan \u2013 do it until I could and then walk away.\u201d But at 18 another major setback shifted Kerr\u2019s thinking for good. A sickening ACL injury forced the rising star out of her sport, once again, yet during the time on the sidelines her love for football began to blossom. \u201cI think I was kind of rolling along, not really thinking about it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then when something gets taken away from you, you don\u2019t really know what you have until it\u2019s gone. It couldn\u2019t have become more real, because I had 12 months out of the game and all I wanted to do after that was get back out onto the field.\u201d A move away from Fremantle, from family, from the ties and passions of childhood, followed. Sydney beckoned. Then football took her to New York, with the Western New York Flash as a teammate of the then peerless Abby Wambach. Face to face with the best in the world, Kerr\u2019s abiding trait \u2013 her fierce determination \u2013 spurred her to raise her game once again. 67 goals in 109 games later, Kerr is the NWSL\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer, surpassing even the greats of the world\u2019s best national team. After not only bouncing back from that life-altering ACL injury (and enduring two subsequent lengthy injury lay-offs), but actively blossoming, the steely determination that fires her is apparent. And while the sport she loves may have changed, the approach she brings to it is as rugged and fearless as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
