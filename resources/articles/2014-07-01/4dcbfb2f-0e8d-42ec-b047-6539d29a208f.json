The decisions we make in these purchases and investments will often have far reaching implications for quality of life, meaning that when thinking about living standards we need to consider where and how consumers spend their money, not just how much they have. As we face more of these complex choices the role of regulators, competition authorities and consumer intermediaries becomes even more important in protecting, promoting and improving the choices consumers make. Government also has to ensure that consumer policy lines up with the reality of people\u2019s lives and concerns. If these bodies are going to live up to expectations, they need access to the right information about how consumers are thinking, feeling and behaving. In short, understanding consumers has never been more important than it is right now. As the voice of consumers, Which? has been developing an array of research and analysis to understand consumers better. Importantly, as well as looking at headline data on consumer spending, saving and investment, inflation and a range of market analysis, we focus heavily on developing insight into how consumers are experiencing the changing economic landscape, how experiences vary across different parts of the country and between different types of consumers and the motivations and drivers of consumer behaviour. Our latest research is the Which? Financial Distress Map. This mapping tool aggregates data on financial distress at an individual level, from our monthly nationally representative polling of 2,000 UK consumers, to create estimates of financial distress at a neighbourhood, parliamentary constituency and regional level. Our individual measures are based on a five point scale that ranges from a low level of distress that captures households that are \u201ccutting back on essentials\u201d to the highest level of distress, where households have \u201cdefaulted on a loan, bill or housing cost\u201d in the last month. These data are then linked to statistically distinct types of neighbourhood (geo-demographics) as building blocks for our area based estimates. We then give each area an index score that represents its position in the geographic distribution of financial distress. The results tend to reflect the varied picture of economic wellbeing across the country. Those areas with relatively high levels of deprivation - Northern Ireland; the West Midlands; and the North East - are the most financially distressed regions. At geographic levels below this we see clusters of financial distress in and around our main cities and in old industrial towns. In this respect, the results are unsurprising. However, within the context of recent discussion of a quickly growing economy they do provide a much needed reminder of the diversity of experiences for families across the country. They also provide a much better depth of understanding on how consumers are experiencing deprivation and poverty. That in some parts of the country one in six families is either covering essential costs with payday loans or unauthorised overdrafts or are simply defaulting on household bills, is a finding that everyone \u2013 whether regulator, government or consumer body - should be aware of. There are also some more surprising results. By digging into the detailed neighbourhood level data, the divergent experiences of local areas within regions and parliamentary constituencies can be teased out. What we find most interesting are the pockets of distress in areas of affluence and, conversely, pockets of low distress amongst areas with relatively high deprivation. These results show the need to look beyond headline figures. However, these are not the only results of interest. As with all tools of this nature, the wealth of data and functionality means everyone can explore the areas that they care about. So go ahead, pop in your postcode, compare yourselves to your friends and family and tell us what you find."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
