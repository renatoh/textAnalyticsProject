In a letter to the US Patent and Trademark Office shared exclusively with the Guardian, the Vermont senator and the New York representative accuse the pharmaceutical company, Gilead, of \u201cdeceitful and immoral\u201d behavior in holding back the drug, Descovy, from the market until its patent term for an earlier, allegedly less safe anti-HIV drug had been exhausted. \u201cIt is an absolute disgrace that in America, a greedy drug company like Gilead can deprive hundreds of thousands of Americans of lifesaving HIV medicine to extract more profit, lie about it, and then have the audacity to ask the US government to award it with a longer monopoly to reap tens of billions more in profits,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have got to block this obscene giveaway for corporate wrongdoing. The Trump administration must not reward Gilead for this immoral behavior.\u201d The involvement of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez casts a powerful spotlight on efforts by a grassroots activist group, PrEP4All Collaboration, to block a patent extension for Descovy. The group filed a petition with the patent office last week, laying out the allegations against Gilead. Gilead did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In a reply last week to the PrEP4All petition, Gilead spokesman Ryan McKeel said: \u201cPatent safety is of foremost importance to us, and any implication that Gilead delayed the development of a drug known to be safer than [the older drug] is false.\u201d But the letter by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez accuses Gilead of profiteering. \u201cIn the process of applying for patent extension,\u201d they write, \u201cGilead withheld information on its true motives\u201d for halting Descovy\u2019s development. \u201cGilead should absolutely be denied a patent extension request for failing to disclose material information to the USPTO [patent office],\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cThey kept a safer drug off the market to extract profit. In doing so, they have inhibited efforts to end the HIV epidemic. I am proud to join Senator Sanders today in calling on the USPTO to deny their patent extension request.\u201d Gilead has made $36bn off an earlier anti-HIV drug, Truvada, since 2004, the members of Congress wrote in a letter dated 6 December. \u201cCorporate misconduct must not be rewarded by the US government through extending a government-granted monopoly on this medicine.\u201d The letter also observed that \u201cthousands of people are unnecessarily dying from a preventable disease\u201d, with the latest generation of anti-HIV drugs shown to be 99% effective at curbing transmission. \u201cIf manufactured generically\u201d Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez wrote, \u201cDescovy could quickly and affordably reach hundreds of thousands of Americans.\u201d If the government extends Gilead\u2019s patent, the corporation could use its monopoly to charge several thousand times more for the same compound, the members of Congress said. That, they added, would put it out of reach for untold numbers of Americans desperate for affordable HIV treatment and prevention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
