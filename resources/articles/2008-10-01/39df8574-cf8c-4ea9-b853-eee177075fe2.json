For 11 minutes here, Manchester United's forward line read Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Dimitar Berbatov, the first time the fab four have been fielded together. It was short-lived but the quartet sparkled both individually and collectively, suggesting they will soon become the world's most devastating attack. \"It's scary, isn't it?\" said Paul Ince, the Blackburn Rovers manager. \"You can spend all week, as I have done, discussing tactics and personnel, but when a team is that good sometimes you can't do anything about it.\" Despite this glowing assessment, Ince reiterated his belief that the 1993-94 Double-winning United team he was a part of was Sir Alex Ferguson's finest since the Scot became manager almost 22 years ago. They certainly had strength and guts in himself, Roy Keane and Mark Hughes, deadly pace through Andrei Kanchelskis and Ryan Giggs and a little je ne sais quoi with Eric Cantona. But that team was a simpler beast than Ferguson's current crop, one designed for the straight lines of the Premier League rather than the sophistication of the Champions League. The 2008 model, by contrast, is as chic as a Parisian boutique. It was Rovers who helped dismantle Ferguson's first championship-winning team by pipping them to the title in 1995, and it was Rovers here who more resembled their uncomplicated setup. But Matt Derbyshire is no Cantona, and Old Trafford may come to cherish a new maverick in Berbatov. He alone of United's outfielders wore black boots, and he alone ignored Ferguson's directions for defensive discipline. Whereas Giggs, positioned in the middle, marked Tugay Kerimoglu, who so often pulls the strings for Rovers, and Ronaldo and Rooney, positioned wide, tracked the all-too-infrequent forward runs of Blackburn's full-backs, Berbatov regularly left his station of central striker, dropping deeper and consequently moulding numerous opportunities for his team-mates. His reluctance to conform to expectations paid dividends for United's stunning second goal. Berbatov it was who won the ball in, of all places, a left-back position. Twenty seconds later it was in Blackburn's net after Ferguson's nominal wingers combined, Rooney sweeping Ronaldo's cutback into the top corner. \"We're getting back to the way we know we can play now,\" said Rooney after a fourth successive victory and United's best performance this season. That the England forward, who declared himself fit for the coming World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus despite a troublesome ankle, excelled in the wide position where he has often been ineffective was due to the fluency and fluidity of United's play. With the full-backs providing extra width and Anderson and Darren Fletcher offering protection in midfield, Rooney and his accomplices could drift where they pleased when the ball was in their possession. Even in the most English of conditions, United's attack was based on continental principles - rapid interchange of positions and transference of the ball, kaleidoscopic movement and angles, and no shortage of skill. Dazzling to watch, impossible to defend. Tevez entered shortly after the second goal, replacing Giggs, and United's four playmakers briefly took it in turns to create chances for one another. At times they were so tightly knit that a designer blanket could have been thrown over them. Blackburn's goalkeeper, Jason Brown, who continues to deputise for the calf-strain victim Paul Robinson, was named the home side's man of the match for restricting the score to two, but the groundsman might have been a more deserving recipient for gifting United a pitch on which to exhibit their advanced brand of football despite the torrential rain. But as much as their style has evolved over the last decade and a half, there are some things that perhaps do not change. Wes Brown scored United's opener after a foul by Nemanja Vidic on the Blackburn keeper that was not spotted by the referee, Steve Bennett, an oversight typical of a recurring pattern, according to Ince. \"I think the bigger teams get the bigger decisions,\" he said. \"I'm not just saying it because of today, but I played for Man United so I know.\" It was the second successive league game United have benefited from a refereeing mistake after Rob Styles's award of a penalty against Bolton. But the decision only made their fans delight even more in Ince's misfortune, as if in their quartet of forwards they did not already have enough to gloat about.
