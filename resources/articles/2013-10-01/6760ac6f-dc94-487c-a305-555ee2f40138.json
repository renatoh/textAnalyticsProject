The former chancellor said signs of economic recovery are \"not yet the healthy growth that we require\", echoing the caution expressed by the business secretary, Vince Cable. Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Clarke said the coalition is \"vulnerable\" to arguments that people are still suffering financially following the economic crisis. He praised the chancellor, George Osborne, for continuing his commitment to spending cuts and reducing the deficit but made it clear the Tories are facing a battle over living standards. He said people are being \"driven up the wall\" by high household bills. \"The problem we face politically is that \u2026 the ordinary member of the public is not feeling much better from this,\" he told a fringe meeting. \"There are improving economic statistics about growth, and unemployment is falling and all that, but the average man is perfectly entitled to say there's not much of that around here.\" He said the answer is for the coalition to say \"we know and understand\" squeezed household budgets and set out a path to \"sustainable growth\" by turning the economy towards exports and industry. \"The growth so far is not the healthy growth in every way that we require,\" he said. Clarke backed the chancellor's conference speech pledging to stick to austerity and applauded him for not being too \"triumphalist\" about the recovery. However, his comments appear to back up the stance of Cable, who has warned that Britain cannot rest on its laurels or get \"complacent\" if it is serious about getting \"the kind of growth we want\". Clarke's remarks on the financial pressures faced by ordinary people will also play into the hands of Labour, which has warned of a \"cost of living crisis\". Asked whether the Tories need an emblematic policy to counter Ed Miliband's promise to freeze energy bills, Clarke suggested that was needed by saying: \"That will eventually come.\" The veteran minister, who confirmed he will stand again at the next election, also cast doubt on the Tories' chances of winning in 2015. \"We're all hoping we're going to get an overall majority at the next election. That's going to be an extremely tall order, a very tall order,\" he said. \"We've got to get the Ukip [vote] down to a sensible size.\" In outspoken comments, he also said the country already has enough rules to deal with \"health tourism\" and expressed sympathy with \"hard-pressed managers\" who do not have time to check the immigration status of patients. He made the remarks despite the prime minister's pledge to crack down on abuse of the NHS earlier this year. Clarke also said his party should be relaxed about Ukip's warnings about \"hordes of Bulgarians\" coming to the UK next year. The minister said he does not believe many Romanians and Bulgarians will come over to Britain when EU restrictions are lifted as many are already here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
