Former defence minister Peter Kilfoyle, who nominated Mr Blair for the leadership in 1994 but is now a critic, said: \"I think it is bizarre, not only what he's announced, but the way he's announced that he will not be around in four or five years' time. \"The fact it should be on TV rather than through some party instrument - he has after all just spent a week at the conference - might be the real world, but does it go down well with the comrades? I don't think so. I don't think for one moment that he'll go through a full third term. I bet he's got something else lined up, though I don't know what it is.\" Ashok Kumar, MP for Middlesbrough South and Cleveland East, said: \"At least what he said clears the air and all the candidates can start positioning themselves and the parliamentary Labour party will be looking for a great outstanding candidate to take socialism forward into the 21st century.\" The MP for Cardiff Central, Jon Owen Jones, said the PM had bought no more than a breathing space until after the election. \"I can understand the reasons why he made the statement because undergoing this treatment would inevitably lead to more speculation about when he is leaving,\" he said. Halifax MP Alice Mahon, a leftwinger retiring at the election, said: \"There is a big lack of trust in the prime minister, particularly over Iraq. I'm not certain it's in the best interests of the Labour party for him to say he will go on.\" Tony Wright, Labour chairman of the all-party Commons public administration committee, said the announcement could herald a new phase in the Blair government. \"It was exactly the right sort of thing to do. All the suggestions that he will be a lame-duck prime minister is nonsense. On the contrary, just like American presidents in their second term, this could be his legacy term.\" Bolton South East MP Brian Iddon, who opposed the war, warned that Iraq would continue to dog the premier. \"Tony can pack up now or pack up immediately after the next election, but the Iraq thing will still be going on,\" he said. \"I didn't agree with him on going to war but I do admire him for staying on to sort it out and not just leaving it to Gordon Brown. What he is saying is that he is not running away.\" Wrekin MP Peter Bradley, a loyalist, said: \"I imagine he did this because he thought that going into hospital for the treatment he needs would simply have given fresh impetus to this endless speculation about his future.\" Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn, a leftwing critic, said: \"I was surprised by his announcement but it keeps off demands for his resignation doesn't it?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
