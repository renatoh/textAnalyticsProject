Pyne was responding to a question from a young Australian Muslim and former Iraqi refugee, Mohammad Al-Khafaji, who said that every time there was an attack he and his community were called upon to condemn it and explain themselves. The industry minister and leader of the house told the ABC program that Muslim communities condemned such acts but \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be called on to do so because it suggests that they didn\u2019t want to do it\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve never known one of these things to happen where Muslim leaders in Australia didn\u2019t come out and condemn them, but by the very act of demanding they come out you suggest that they didn\u2019t want to, and that is something that we must stop happening in Australia,\u201d Pyne said on Monday evening. \u201cWhoever is doing that must stop it, because it is pejorative demand. I don\u2019t know any Muslims in my community who would think that the acts in Paris or in Lebanon or anywhere else were reasonable, and their leadership should react exactly the same way as everyone else\u2019s leadership, which is to be horrified and aghast by it.\u201d Pyne declined to comment on the appropriateness of the comment in February by the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, that more Muslim leaders should describe Islam as a religion of peace \u201cmore often, and mean it\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be partisan and political,\u201d Pyne said. The Q&amp;A program focused on the challenge of clamping down on terrorism after Islamic State (Isis) claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks in the French capital that killed more than 130 people on Friday. The French ambassador to Australia, Christophe Lecourtier, joined the Q&amp;A panel and said his country would not be intimidated by the attacks. \u201cWe share the same values,\u201d he said of France and Australia. \u201cIt means that we want to be able to go out with anybody, to dress as we want, to be in love with any people we want, we love. So that\u2019s the kind of things these people do not accept, and until the very last moment you can be sure that France will resist that, and we shall never retreat one millimetre from our values.\u201d Andrew MacLeod, a former United Nations official, said it was not a time for slogans and he believed the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was displaying \u201cthoughtful leadership\u201d. \u201cBut what we need from our national leadership now is to determine who is the \u2018them\u2019 and who is the \u2018us\u2019,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cThere are two broad choices. Is it us westerners, against them, all of Islam, or is it us, moderates of all religions, against them, radicals of all religions? \u201cWe have organisations in this country, like Reclaim Australia, who really are falling into the trap of Islamic State, who are trying to create the us westerners against them, all of Islam. If we fall into that trap, we are saying we want to fight with 1.6 billion people, whereas if we define the us as all moderates of all religions \u2013 Judaism, Christianity, Islam \u2013 against radicals of all religions, it\u2019s a much smaller number to fight, and a much more effective number to fight.\u201d Pyne agreed that Isis must not succeed in \u201cturning Australian against Australian or European against European\u201d. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t allow extremist militant Islamists to represent the Islamic faith,\u201d the minister said. \u201cModerate Muslims need to be embraced in Australia or elsewhere, moderate Muslim governments need to be embraced wherever they might be, because they have as much at stake as we do in defeating the extremists.\u201d The Labor frontbencher Kate Ellis said moderate Muslims were \u201cour closest ally in this fight\u201d and it was a time for cool and calm heads. \u201cThat means that our leaders need to all step up and be putting forward messages of unity and the importance of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t just talk about political leaders. I think all leaders across our community. I, for one, cannot for a moment comprehend why Pauline Hanson was on our television over the weekend speaking about these events and about Muslim Australians.\u201d The independent senator Nick Xenophon said the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was \u201ca bloody mess\u201d and spawned sectarian violence. \u201cWe must acknowledge that we cannot bomb our way out of this,\u201d he said. The entrepreneur Holly Ransom called for community leadership, saying \u201ceach and every single one of us\u201d can play a role in supporting social cohesion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
