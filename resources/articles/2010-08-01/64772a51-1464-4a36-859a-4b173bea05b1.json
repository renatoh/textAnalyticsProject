An old road, the Hardway, leads eastwards from the crossroads towards Stourhead where the Hoare family created their notable garden and lake. The landlord of the inn on the Hardway says that coaches used to take on fresh horses there for the pull up Kingsettle Hill. Recently we were taken to walk a curious and little-known track, made of broken cobbles and sometimes called the old coach road, following a rigidly straight line from Redlynch towards Stourhead for several miles across fields. We wondered at the purpose of a second coach road seeming almost to duplicate the Hardway. From a point where you could see the track enter Stavordale Wood, we walked the cobbled way westwards towards Redlynch, passing Coachroad Farm and Walk Farm as we went between the meadows, some recently cut for hay in this dry summer. By the gates of Redlynch House, we were glad to shelter under the park's spreading trees from a rare and torrential downpour. Once home and dry we were shown a book which told us that Parson Woodforde, the diarist, and a group of relatives and friends went in September 1763 on a jaunt from his home at Castle Cary to \"Mr Hoare the Bankers Gardens at Stourton\". They took Lord Ilchester's private way through his Redlynch estate, thanks to the fact that a friend had keys to the gates. The public roads were poor; there were few well-kept turnpike roads in the district. Our cobbled track was, it seems, a private road for Lord Ilchester's family and friends, and offered an altogether safer, smoother ride than other folk enjoyed on the first leg of the 120-mile journey to London, which Lady Ilchester undertook for each of her six confinements. Nowadays we all take our equal chances on the A303."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
