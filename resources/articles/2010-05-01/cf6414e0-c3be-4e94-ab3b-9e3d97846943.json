This match has been dominated by one of them but not the most obvious candidate. While Marcus Trescothick has managed only a cameo in this contest Adam Lyth, the twinkle-toed 22-year-old left-hander from Whitby, has been the dominant figure among the batsmen. In Yorkshire's first innings Lyth hit his highest score, 142. Today he added another 93 to become the highest run-scorer in Division One with 622 (only Chris Rogers, for Derbyshire in Division Two, has got more). Already this is a big improvement on 2009, when he was better known as a regular 12th man for England, being so swift in the field. However, he was in danger of becoming a Gary Pratt figure. Last summer he was selected for only four championship games for Yorkshire. This year he has taken the chance to open the batting and is making the most of it. Discipline has been allied to his obvious flair. His technique has proved equal to facing the new ball, at least on benign surfaces like this. He scores a high proportion of his runs square on the off-side, whether driving or cutting. Yesterday Trescothick soon stationed a scout on the boundary for him and no matter how many men were posted in the infield in that region \u2013 at times there were four \u2013 Lyth was still able to thread the ball through them. His duel with Murali Kartik was diverting. The left-hander moved outside the line of off-stump to play the ball, usually off the back foot and adjusting late to the slow turn. All the honours had gone to the young Yorkshireman until the last ball of the day when he swept at Kartik, missed and was lbw. He became the second opener of the day to be disappointed in the 90s. Earlier Arul Suppiah, having compiled a worthy 99, had edged to slip against David Wainwright. By the time Lyth was dismissed Yorkshire had amassed a lead of 182, enough to ensure a draw but probably not enough to gain a victory, assuming the pitch and the uncompromising approach of the two teams remain the same on the final day. This game has been sternly contested and the chances of a challenging declaration from Yorkshire are small."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
