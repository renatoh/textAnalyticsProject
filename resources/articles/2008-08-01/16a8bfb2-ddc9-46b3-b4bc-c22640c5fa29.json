Sadly, it's hardly worth the effort. Visually it's not too bad, with crisp-looking 3D tables and convincing physics governing cue and ball movement. The problems start with using the Wiimote as a cue, with a clumsy prodding motion that feels nothing like the real thing. Flashy motion-blur effects and 31 annoying songs hardly compensate for ponderous AI and players you can't customise. It's a pity, because with 13 different playing modes, there's plenty of ball-bashing on offer. If only it were fun to play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
