After years of physical turmoil this may be regarded by some as a bold aspiration yet Woods defied all odds to win a 15th major, at Augusta National, in April. Since that juncture, all bets have been off. In a break from his preparations at Pebble Beach, where he will attempt to win a fourth US Open starting on Thursday, Woods was asked to what extent Nicklaus\u2019s total features as motivation. The 43-year-old took a deliberately broad approach to answering. \u201cIf I keep progressing how I am physically and how I\u2019m getting better and better, I just need to give myself chances,\u201d he said. \u201cHypothetically, let\u2019s say I give myself 10 years. That\u2019s 40 major championships. That\u2019s a lot of majors. \u201cAnd now the trick is, can I keep myself healthy enough and strong enough and fast enough to endure all that, considering what my body has gone through. That\u2019s where I need help with all my trainers, physios, my workout regimes, and hopefully I can make that happen.\u201d Woods had earlier played down the sense that winning 18 majors or more features most in his competitive outlook. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to me is that I\u2019m back playing again,\u201d he said. \u201cThis game was taken away from me for a few years. And I miss competing, I miss playing. \u201cNow I have an opportunity to do that again and also to be able to share it with my kids. They don\u2019t remember me enjoying golf, because all they remember is Daddy on the ground in pain. \u201cNow, golf brings me so much joy, they\u2019re able to see that. And if it brings a smile to their faces, it brings a smile to my own.\u201d Woods was clearly short of fitness and energy en route to missing the cut at last month\u2019s US PGA Championship at Bethpage. While unwilling to specify the nature of the affliction, he admitted he was \u201cin rough shape\u201d. The same fate, many fear, will befall Pebble Beach this week. The US Open\u2019s organisers have been widely criticised in recent years for course setup. Woods hinted at such concerns once more at a venue where he won by 15 shots in 2000. He will not yet fully endorse the strategy deployed by the United States Golf Association. \u201cThe greens are all slanted, very small targets,\u201d Woods said. \u201cAnd if they ever firm up then we have a totally different ballgame. \u201cThis week I feel like I\u2019m trending in the right direction. I need one more day of prep. I want to see the course when it\u2019s a little bit closer to game time. I know they\u2019re holding it back but I just want to see how much are they going to let it go and show us how it\u2019s going to be come Thursday.\u201d With that inevitable change of backdrop in mind, Woods opted for a driving range and putting session on the California coast on Tuesday rather than playing practice holes. \u201cI did the same thing at Augusta,\u201d he said. \u201cI am just trying to save my energy. It is more important for me to feel energised than it is to go out there and get wear and tear.\u201d Brooks Koepka, who took a second consecutive US PGA title last month and is seeking a third US Open win in a row, has aimed a broadside at the tournament\u2019s host broadcaster for what he perceives as a lack of respect. Koepka makes an effective habit of sourcing pre-major grudges, with this one linked to coverage. \u201cThere\u2019s a commercial running now where I\u2019m not even in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Fox [Sports] put it up for a preview of the US Open. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, you guys tell me. I wasn\u2019t on the list of notables [on day one of the 2018 US Open] after winning it the year before. There\u2019s a couple of things where it\u2019s just mind-boggling \u2026 it\u2019s like, really? Like, how do you forget that? \u201cA bunch of people on Twitter tagged me in it, in the promo, and I guess were amazed that I wasn\u2019t in it. I just clicked on the link and saw it and watched it. I was just kind of shocked. \u201cThey\u2019ve had over a year to kind of put it out. So I don\u2019t know. Somebody probably got fired over it or should.\u201d A laugh \u2013 just about \u2013 followed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
