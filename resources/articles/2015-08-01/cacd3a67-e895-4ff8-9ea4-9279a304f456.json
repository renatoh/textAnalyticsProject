To see a recap of episode four, click here. With so much time spent with the Gorbiers, Witnesses is, by this point, as much horror film as police thriller, even entering full-on slasher mode when that bad man in clownface was wandering around, brandishing a bloodied knife. Now I\u2019ve stopped expecting everything to make sense, and resigned myself to a bundle of loose ends, I\u2019m really enjoying it. I\u2019m certainly determined not to let next week\u2019s finale frustrate me. How about you? The case Kaz prepares to kill Paul, his wife and himself, but J\u00e9r\u00e9mie helps Paul escape and Gorbier is captured after Sandra locates his hideout. Laura is apparently distressed by Paul\u2019s capture, and leaves a key in the show home as a clue. The key opens the postbox of the first show home, in which lie pictures of Paul\u2019s ex-lover and \u2013 I think \u2013 Laura\u2019s mother, who committed suicide in 1996. Henri Norbert, meanwhile, is hauled in for the deaths of Weber, Muse, Laplace and Kremer after Sandra spots him on an ancient home video placing them all at the same tennis tournament. Gorbier (who, incidentally, is far scarier when he\u2019s not losing his temper and shouting) may be in custody, but there\u2019s still plenty to resolve next week. The odd couple With Justin still out for the count and Paul otherwise engaged, Sandra shouldered the case herself tonight (no thanks to the useless Maxine \u2013 although the way she was mooning over the photo of Paul made me wonder if they\u2019d had a fling). And, just when I was thinking Sandra\u2019s OCD had been forgotten, it resurfaced with her, um, committed re-enactment of Gorbier\u2019s most recent attack. Congratulations to Addicks123 for rumbling the golf club connection. I was deeply dismayed by the outcome of Sandra and Paul\u2019s heart-to-heart. How has she been that desperate for approval and validation from this strange man for so long? I think we can also probably rule out Paul being the father of either Chlo\u00e9e or the miscarried child, unless he\u2019s a better actor that any of us ever suspected: there seemed to be neither guilt nor contrition after Sandra told him about the miscarriage. Paul Maisonneuve This series now looks to be about the redemption of Paul Maisonneuve, rather than anything much to do with Sandra. All the strands of the case tie to his past misdemeanours including, I feel sure, Norbert\u2019s involvement. I\u2019m also fairly sure Laura knows (or thinks) she is Paul\u2019s daughter, oblivious though he is. The line about her reminding him of someone he loved came back to me at the end of the episode, when he talked about \u201cthe first woman I ever loved.\u201d Why was Gorbier so desperate for Paul to watch him dancing with his wife Jane (in what looked liked her wedding dress)? I wondered if we were meant to infer that Jane and Paul had a fling in the past \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t put it past the dirty dog \u2013 and even that J\u00e9r\u00e9mie might have been the result. A dalliance too far, surely. Other key players Laura: Compl\u00e8tement fou, it seems (the doll\u2019s house, the crack-up prompted by Paul\u2019s disappearance), but driven so by the suicide of her mother. And who is her accomplice? It was very dark and the contrast on my TV is terrible, but we definitely got a glimpse and the voice sounded young. It certainly wasn\u2019t J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gorbier, who was locked in with his mad dad. Was it Paul\u2019s son, Thomas? If so, this would tally either with the idea that Laura is in fact Paul\u2019s daughter, or that both of them hold him ultimately responsible for the deaths of their mothers. Which begs the question: what does she want from Paul? An apology? Love? Recognition? His demise? I suspect her fury was more because someone had got to him first rather than genuine concern for his safety, but I could be wrong. I loved the Laura poster on her wall, by the way. Witnesses now feels absolutely of a piece with that film\u2019s delirious, noirish toying with identity, obsession and mistakes that can\u2019t be rectified. Henri Norbert: Finally, what we\u2019ve all suspected for some time, and what Addicks123 (again!) put together last week: Norbert has been bumping off his blackmailers, the Roland Garros Four. But why? The police talked about him having murdered someone, hence the blackmail, but do we know this for sure? I mourn the fact that we still know so little about his character at this late stage. He still comes across as a mildly rude non-entity at the moment. I\u2019d have liked to feel more of a sense of vindication or triumph about his detention. Damien: Looking like Norbert\u2019s stooge. He certainly seemed agitated by his boss\u2019s arrest, and that parting shot to Paul was very strange. \u201cYou want the firm to fold so people will leave Le Tr\u00e9port like you did.\u201d Why would Paul want to do that to a friend? Time of the Wolf Lupine references largely absent this week, although I felt a slight sense of anticlimax as the wolf padded off-screen. Where is the poor thing being kept? Even so, Marie Dompnier did an absolutely bang-up job of looking utterly terrified. Thoughts and observations Le Tr\u00e9port tourist board alternative slogan of the week: \u201cLe Tr\u00e9port \u2013 where every family\u2019s an unhappy one.\u201d At the start, when Paul was on the mattress, who did he spot wrapped up in plastic? Was it the policemen Gorbier killed while abducting his family? I\u2019m all for atmosphere, but some of the lighting in this episode was so gloomy that it was genuinely hard to see what was going on. Kaz likes his murder victims to be clean (and clean-shaven \u2013 I shuddered at the intimacy of that scene) before he does the deed. Once a dentist, always a dentist. What song was Gorbier humming while he danced with his wife? Or, for that matter, the song playing while Kaz lay on the bed with her? Sandra\u2019s desperate hunt on the golf course was nicely handled. I thought the soundtrack came into its own in this sequence. The interlude when Sandra visited Justin\u2019s house (I think?) and retrieved the paperbacks was odd, and felt significant. He wasn\u2019t exactly houseproud, by the looks of it. Why did Laura introduce herself to Sandra? I\u2019m not sure what she had to gain, given that Sandra was unlikely to give up many details about Paul. Is Gorbier ultimately just a vengeful rent-a-psycho \u2013 Asking his son, \u201care you afraid of me? Why?\u201d displayed a lamentable lack of self-awareness \u2013 or are his motives a little more complex? \u201cI have you by the balls. They were hard to find.\u201d Was I the only one to punch the air at this point?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
