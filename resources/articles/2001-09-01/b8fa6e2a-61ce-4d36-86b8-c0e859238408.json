With a \u00a3125bn market at stake, car manufacturers were lobbying furiously in advance of European Parliament hearings, themselves designed to pressure the European Commission to introduce deregulation proposals later this year. Carmakers such as Ford, Volkswagen, Fiat, DaimlerChrysler and Renault are currently exempted from EU competition rules, and they have long stifled attempts to get them to drop special sales and service conditions. MEPs, consumer groups and the commission all claim the current \"bloc exemption\" system, set up 20 years ago to help Europe's fledgling car industry hampers cross-border free trade, inflates prices and hinders competition. \"This exemption drives up prices,\" said Jim Murray, director of the BEUC consumers' organization. \"Car-buyers can have high standards of sales, service and maintenance without the restrictions on competition and the high prices promoted by the car industry.\" EU citzens must buy cars exclusively through franchised dealerships in their own country. These are run within exclusive selling territories that block out any competitors. Owners are also forced to service their cars exclusively at dealer garages through repair and servicing contracts often offered when the car is sold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
