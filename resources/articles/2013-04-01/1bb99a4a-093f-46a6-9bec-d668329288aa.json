The thrilling vehemence of Gurtu's accents and his speed and tonal variety with hybrid east-west instruments have lost none of their impact over the years, and the trumpeters' distinctive approaches are fascinating: Nils Petter Molvaer's Silent Way-like spaciness on Miles Davis's Jack Johnson; Paolo Fresu's nimble grooving on the Cherry-dedicated Berchidda; the graceful trills and flutters of classical musician Matthias H\u00f6fs; or the slinky microtonalisms of the Lebanese Ibrahim Maalouf on Universal Mother. Ambrose Akinmusire, contrasting a glowing, slow-burn exposition of the famous All Blues with a percussively Indian-influenced reappraisal of it, unleashes plenty of his own spellbinding moments. Only some rather blandly world-funky ensemble hooks (like pastiches of the late Joe Zawinul's Syndicate) dissipate the impact of an unusual adventure. A Gurtu trio with Cuban pianist Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu tour these themes in the north and Scotland later in April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
