How can one letter asking permission cost \u00a385?", "bodyText": "Q I own the leasehold of a flat and wish to let it whilst I go abroad. The terms of the leasehold say I must gain the freeholder's consent. The managing agent is trying to charge me \u00a385 to inform the freeholder and gain his consent. This appears to be a ridiculous amount to write a letter, especially since I know who the freeholder is, so I could write direct. Do I have to pay this charge? WM A Yes, if you use the managing agent to inform the freeholder and obtain his consent. But you are right in thinking that if you side-step the managing agent by writing directly to the freeholder, you can avoid the charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
