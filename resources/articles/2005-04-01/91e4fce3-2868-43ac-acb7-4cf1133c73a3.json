Influences from Morocco to Zimbabwe create a tribal-inspired design that provides a long-awaited change from the Ikea-esque minimalism that prevails elsewhere. Comprising linked passageways, tiered levels and tent-draped lounge areas, Umbaba has the air of a secret garden. Expect to pay \u00a39.50 for a Republique Du Person original cocktail, and to see a wealth of heiress wannabes. Umbaba doesn't have a VIP area - the whole place is VIP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
