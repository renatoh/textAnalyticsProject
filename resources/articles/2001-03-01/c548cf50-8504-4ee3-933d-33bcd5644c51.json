Tories reacted furiously after ministers announced that peers will be asked later this month to vote on whether to impose an outright ban before being given the chance to vote on other options to regulate the sport. The government's move, which appeared to be a mere technicality, angered Tory peers, who detected a ministerial plot to force them into a premature confrontation with the Commons. MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on fox hunting last month after rejecting the two other options in the \"multiple choice\" bill - self- regulation and a licensing system. The government had indicated that peers would vote on the three options in the hunting bill in the same way as MPs, with the ban vote coming last. But when peers vote on the bill on March 26, they will be asked to vote first on whether to impose a ban, an option they will reject. Tory sources in the Lords said they suspected the government wanted to provoke the Lords into a confrontation with MPs so that Labour could go into the election claiming that \"toffs in the Lords\" had refused to accept the will of the elected chamber. Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords, said: \"The government is trying to strong-arm parliament for Labour's private political purposes. The government is attempting to bounce the Lords into a vote with the minimum possible notice.\" Lady Jay, Labour leader in the Lords, dismissed the Tory claims as \"nonsense\". The row came as peers debated the hunting bill for the first time last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
