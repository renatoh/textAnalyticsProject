A mildly diverting game of rugby? More a supreme test of manhood masquerading as family entertainment. Jamie Roberts is a qualified doctor rather than a Shakespearean scholar but, on the eve of Twickenham battle, there are distant Celtic-infused echoes of Henry V on the eve of Agincourt. Listen, for example, to Roberts\u2019 stark description of his most spectacular collision with the Springboks in Pretoria for the British and Irish Lions in 2009. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the second Lions Test at Loftus Versfeld when there were five of us in the hospital afterwards,\u201d he says, matter of factly. \u201cAdam [Jones] came off with a shoulder which took two or three hours to get back in, Gethin smashed his face, O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s head was twice its normal size, I injured my wrist and ended up needing an operation, Tommy Bowe hurt his elbow. There were five of us in an ambulance going to the hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s what lies in store for us this weekend. It\u2019s pretty gruesome but that\u2019s the nature of the game now. You\u2019ve got to be prepared to put your body on the line and take it to places where you haven\u2019t been before. This week all the players are relaxed but ready for complete warfare come the 80 minutes.\u201d This, remember, is a qualified medic relating the casualty list from a rugby field, not a multi-vehicle pile-up. For Wales, the 2015 tournament has already been brutal, spitting out brave, broken young men on a weekly basis. Roberts reveals he and his team-mates have been attempting to rationalise the fallout. \u201cWe have sat down as players over dinner and tried to piece together why. And you can\u2019t. Sometimes it is luck of the draw. There is no reason why. We\u2019ve had a couple of ACLs [anterior cruciate ligament], Corey Allen to a hamstring, Liam Williams at the weekend. We have just been unlucky.\u201d Hopefully, there will be no more than a few bruises on either side this weekend; World Rugby, the sport\u2019s governing body, is already on the back foot over rugby\u2019s attrition rate despite zealously policed player welfare safeguards. Roberts, uniquely placed to weigh up both sides of the argument, remains phlegmatic as he braces himself for more voluntary punishment. \u201cWhat can you do? Play sevens? Make it touch rugby? Those questions are for the governing body. Injuries have always been a part of the game. As a player you accept it\u2019ll happen to you some time, you deal with it and try to come back stronger.\u201d Like a weary boxer, however, forced to expend a massive amount of energy in the early rounds against a bigger opponent the question is this: how much more punishment can Wales take? Their pool defeat by Australia was characteristically gallant but it has deposited them on the tougher side of the draw. Even for warriors such as Alun Wyn Jones, Gethin Jenkins, Sam Warburton and Taulupe Faletau it is going to be tough to bash a way through a revitalised Springbok side, who thrive in a close-quarters scrap. \u201cThe way they play you are 80-90% towards losing the game if you lose the battle of the gainline,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge: to get the mind right and put your bodies on the line for physical warfare.\u201d At 28 \u2013 going on 78 in terms of the stress his body has endured en route to becoming his country\u2019s most-capped centre \u2013 Roberts is also fully aware this may be a last chance for a number of Wales players who narrowly failed to reach a World Cup final in New Zealand four years ago. Their desire, if anything, is even stronger now. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge factor,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cWhen you do all those hours of training you dream of playing in games of this magnitude and of seizing the opportunity. \u201cThere are not many more brutal games to lose than a World Cup semi-final by a point. That motivates you. Each one of us has to bring that to the party. Cool heads, bodies on the line and make sure we make the right calls at the right time. We\u2019ll be victorious if we all do that.\u201d How England could have done with a Test Lion like Roberts in their midfield at this World Cup, a proven big match player bright enough to be enrolling at Cambridge University after this World Cup to study for a part-time masters degree in medical science. When he plays well so do Wales: the 20-year-old Tyler Morgan could not wish for a more calming influence inside him in the Twickenham tumult. South Africa will be suitably respectful, having lost 12-6 to Wales in Cardiff last November. This weekend, though, is the true litmus test of northern hemisphere nerve in the shape of four north-south quarter-finals. Roberts is aiming high \u2013 \u201cIt would be great to get four of us through, wouldn\u2019t it? That would send the journos crazy\u201d \u2013 but suspects it will ultimately boil down to Wales\u2019s clarity of thought at key moments. \u201cSlowly over the last five to seven years since the core of this squad has been together we\u2019ve started making those right calls. Defensively we\u2019ve kept teams out as well. We have to put all that together this weekend. It has to be a complete performance if we\u2019re going to beat the Springboks. It\u2019s not just going to happen, it\u2019s going to take the perfect game from us.\u201d In that respect, the last 10 minutes of the pool game against England will be as ideal preparation as any. \u201cDefensively there was no way they were scoring. When you see that resolve and what the guys have worked for in the last few months, the training camps, the pain, it\u2019s all done for a reason, to make the right decisions when you are completely knackered. When you are gasping for breath you are not thinking about getting your breath, you are thinking about the next play. It\u2019s always about mental focus.\u201d Wales will give everything but only if they can disarm South Africa\u2019s power game will Dr Roberts be spared further trauma."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
