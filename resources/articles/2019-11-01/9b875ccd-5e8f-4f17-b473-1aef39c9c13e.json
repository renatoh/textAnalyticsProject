How would that have felt? \u201cTo be fair, I wouldn\u2019t know how I\u2019d feel because I\u2019m not there,\u201d he replies, showing the kind of swerve with which he has made his name. It does not take long for his true sentiments to emerge. The 19\u2011year\u2011old winger was almost driven to Bayern by a combination of frustration and impatience \u2013 the former caused by the Chelsea manager last season, Maurizio Sarri, who barely played him over the first half of the campaign. Bayern had been confident of closing the deal; perhaps too confident. The simple fact was they did not impress the Chelsea hierarchy with the way they went about their business and it is easy to feel their approach served to harden the London club\u2019s resolve to keep their young star. Bayern offered \u00a335m plus \u00a35m in add-ons but Chelsea said no. It did not matter to them that Hudson\u2011Odoi had lodged a transfer request. Plenty has happened to him since then. He got a little run in Sarri\u2019s Premier League XI in April, although curiously not before he had made his first England start against Montenegro in Podgorica at the end of March. Then there was the ruptured achilles that finished his season, ruling him out of important fixtures such as the Europa League final against Arsenal and England\u2019s Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands. That was tough. Hudson-Odoi felt a surge of excitement when Lampard replaced Sarri; he signed a five-year contract in September, worth \u00a3120,000 a week and he can now reflect on having regained fitness after what ended up being five months out, making an impact for Chelsea and regaining his place in the England squad. With Raheem Sterling dropped for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday night after his altercation with Joe Gomez, Hudson-Odoi senses opportunity. It feels as though things have worked out for the best. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that I stayed at Chelsea. I\u2019ve been there all my life, I\u2019ve loved the club from day one. Obviously, the academy boys who have come through are playing loads of games and it\u2019s just a good bond. \u201cI was more thinking about it [signing for Bayern]. I wasn\u2019t saying I was definitely going to sign or I wasn\u2019t going to sign. It was just because of times last year where I felt a bit of frustration or times when I wanted to play more because I love the game. \u201cThere were times where I was thinking: \u2018What happens if I do that?\u2019 But at the same time, I thought: \u2018Chelsea is the club where I\u2019ve been and this is where I want to become a key player.\u2019 Doing it at the club where I\u2019ve been is a massive thing. Does it feel more special? Definitely.\u201d There is an exuberance about Hudson-Odoi and he admits that at heart he is still the 13\u2011year\u2011old Chelsea ball boy who was once photographed celebrating a goal with Samuel Eto\u2019o. There is a desire to express himself, a self-confidence and it derives from his childhood in south London, when he idolised Ronaldinho and Cristiano Ronaldo and loved to play cage football or simply in the street. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to be confident in every game you play. There\u2019s no way you can show fear or be scared of any situation. The cage football helped a lot. It\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d Lampard has been tough, at times, with Hudson-Odoi, seeking to keep him grounded and create the right framework for his free-spiritedness. The manager, who has also blooded Fikayo Tomori, Reece James, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham from the Chelsea academy this season, was in no mood, for example, to allow Hudson-Odoi to bask in his comeback performance against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup in September, in which he scored and the team won 7-1. Instead, Lampard laid into him at half-time for failing to run in behind the opposition defenders. \u201cHe is hard on me but it\u2019s in a good way because he wants me to keep getting better,\u201d Hudson-Odoi says. \u201cThe manager wants to win and he wants to win in the best way. He wants you to get better and that\u2019s why he will tell you in the way he does.\u201d Lampard, plainly, was a key factor in Hudson-Odoi\u2019s decision to re-sign at Chelsea. How many conversations did it take with the manager to convince him? \u201cOne,\u201d Hudson-Odoi replies. \u201cHe just said he believed in me, that he wants me to play for him and things will go well for me at this club. It was exciting times that a new manager was coming in and you know that he will play at least some of the youth boys as well.\u201d Hudson-Odoi has his sights fixed on winning a place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Euro 2020 finals next summer but he acknowledges that the competition from Harry Kane, Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho is fierce. \u201cWhen people say they make up the best front three in the world, it\u2019s a motivation because I want to be one of them. I want to have people say: \u2018OK. There\u2019s five of them now.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
