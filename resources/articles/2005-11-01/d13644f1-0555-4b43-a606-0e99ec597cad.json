Having led through a penalty from Josh Wolff and conceded an unlikely equaliser to Andy Webster, Bruce Arena's side seemed content to play within themselves, with Walter Smith's team performing competently enough at least not to sustain the kind of serious damage that has too often visited them in such fixtures in the recent past. Even the short time that elapsed before the Americans took the lead was sufficient to infer that their advantage was thoroughly merited. There was a slickness about their movement and a conviction and intelligence about their passing that suggested looming danger for Scotland. This early impression was confirmed by the fact that another 27 minutes would pass before Smith's team produced their first scoring attempt. That it should bring the equaliser merely testified to the often unfathomable vagaries of the game. In addition, their second attack of the match could easily have brought the home side a lead, Garry O'Connor failing to convert an excellent opportunity by heading Neil McCann's cross from the left over the crossbar. None of this had seemed remotely possible when Brian Ching made the pass that sent DaMarcus Beasley into the penalty area ahead of the desperately tracking Christian Dailly. The West Ham defender, operating more as a right-winger for the day, simply pushed the PSV Eindhoven midfielder to the ground from behind. Wolff made an expert job of the conversion, sending the ball low and deep into Craig Gordon's right corner. But, having strained to contain their visitors, the Scots achieved equality from a free-kick of their own. Alexander delivered with great precision from wide on the left and Webster was utterly unattended as he rose to head far to the left of Kasey Keller from about 12 yards. This setback seemed to have a diminishing effect on the Americans for a considerable period thereafter, not a good sign in a team heading for the World Cup finals. This loss of ebullience allowed the Scots to play an emphatically more imposing role than had been possible until that time. But with both coaches making two changes at the interval - Scotland's were in defence as the Caldwell brothers, Gary and Steven, replaced David Weir and Steven Pressley respectively - and Arena making a third early in the second half, what competitive edge there was in the match seemed to be blunted. The arrival of James McFadden in place of the veteran Neil McCann on Scotland's left, however, at least guaranteed a heightening of interest, if only for his singularly eccentric style. McFadden, with an immediate dribble past three opponents out of his own defence and into the clear, certainly had a happier introduction than Gary Caldwell, who almost caused his own team the ultimate penalty before becoming the first name in the referee's book. Caldwell's slack pass out of defence surrendered possession, the ball was played out to Beasley and he strode inside from the left and hit a right-foot drive that would have counted but for the intervention of Steven Caldwell, who deflected it for a corner. Almost predictably, Gary was the one who came closest to giving the home side a victory, running on to a cross-field pass from Paul Hartley and hitting a 25-yard drive marginally too high. However, by the finish the obvious lack of incentive among both sets of players seemed once again to highlight the near-worthlessness of friendly matches at this time of the year.
