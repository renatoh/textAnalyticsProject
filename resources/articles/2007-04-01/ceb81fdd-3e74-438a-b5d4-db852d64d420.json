You do not give voters enough credit in their ability to discern who to vote for on a first past the post plus list basis. While the SSP/Solidarity infighting may lead to a reduction in the seats these parties will gain, two recent opinion polls have indicated that the Greens will return with between four and 10 seats. One poll last week put the Scottish Green list vote at 10%, just 1% behind the Scottish Liberal Democrats. Our respective Green parties are looking forward to gains in Holyrood, the Scottish local elections and in the Welsh assembly. Voters are electing more Green representatives each year because they want politicians they can trust to deliver effective policy in areas such as health, education and the environment. We can also confidently predict another record increase in the number of council seats we hold in England.
