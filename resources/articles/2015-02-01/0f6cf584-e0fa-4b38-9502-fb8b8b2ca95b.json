If wheat is to be drilled no time should be lost. The great anxiety is to have as large an acreage sown with this crop as possible in this wartime. Some are urging the farmer to sow beans, but in this district it has of late years not been a favourite crop. It is much more likely that will be an increase in potato growing and in market garden farming, as far as this can be accomplished with the labour available. In many rural districts, every man of military age had gone into the army, and even the older men have taken service as drivers either with the military or have come into the town as horse drivers. In this city alone many teams are idle and work at a stand owing to the want of carters. In passing through the country between the south-eastern suburbs of our city and the Derbyshire hills to-day I found the grass everywhere in an unusually black state. We have not had a cold winter, but most of the land, where not covered with houses and works, is under grass, and owing to the continued rain for the past two months or more the great clouds of smoke, instead of drifting away and falling over a wide area miles in extent, have been precipitated by the rain and have obliterated all the show of green we are accustomed to see on the meadows in rural Cheshire and South-west Lancashire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
