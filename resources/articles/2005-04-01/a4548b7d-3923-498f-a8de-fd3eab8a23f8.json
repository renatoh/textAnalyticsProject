She relished her life as a lesbian and never ceased to be delighted by women. She thought nothing of stopping a woman in the street to tell her she looked lovely. She was not ashamed or scared of her lesbian identity, appearing in the BBC2 series, It's Not Unusual (1997), a lesbian and gay oral history of the 20th century, and publishing her life story - at the age of 84 - in a book called Just Take Your Frock Off. While living in Brighton, she taught children with learning difficulties and cared for a severely disabled young man for 16 years. She also worked as a volunteer in the developing lesbian and gay community. During the 1960s, she was the south-coast representative of the Minorities Research Group, the first openly lesbian org- anisation in Britain. Her job was to organise social events and counsel isolated or bereaved lesbians. She performed these tasks with her usual zest, together with an intuitive, unsentimental kindness. When the Aids crisis hit Britain, Barbara was among the first to volunteer help. By then in her 70s, she buddied numerous sufferers through to their inevitable deaths. Born and brought up in Blackburn, Lancashire, where both her parents worked in a cotton mill, Barbara's long romance with women started when she was 14 and employed at a dairy. Her incipient lesbianism was recognised by a young female customer, who whisked her off in a motor car to the Yellow Hills, and showed her some things she found \"very interesting\". As an adolescent lesbian, Barbara was lucky to have not only a supportive family but also gay people who would help with advice and introductions. A gay man at the dairy taught her how to kiss, took her to Manchester to see revues by Cole Porter and Noel Coward, and introduced her to his friends, Jan and Bert, an older lesbian couple. Cole Porter's song, Experiment, became a lifelong favourite of Barbara's, and she took its advice to heart in her relationships with women. At the age of 17, she and a young German lover found their way to the notorious lesbian club in Paris, Le Monocle, where they became the darlings of the regulars. Stylish to the last - and never fixed in her lesbian identity - Barbara dipped and dived between butch and fem, depending on her lovers' desires. She went to London as a young woman, trained as a policewoman and, during the war, worked all over the capital as a police officer. After the death of her parents, she returned to Blackburn to run the family sweet shop, before training as a teacher. Her jobs included work in a reform school, and in Nigeria, before she moved to Brighton in the mid-1950s. Barbara was devoted to her family, and is survived by her sister and two nephews, whose love and support were unfailing. \u00b7 Barbara Bell, teacher and activist, born December 13 1914; died April 3 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
