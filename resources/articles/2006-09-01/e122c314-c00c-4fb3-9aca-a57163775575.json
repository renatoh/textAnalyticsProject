Not in September anyway. As the rain ran down the front of their shiny promotional tent, the forward party from Valhalla 2008 offered their assurances. \"Get down your bookmaker's, it never rains in September in Kentucky,\" breezed one of them whose perfectly tanned glow suggested as much. Next door, at the Wales 2010 stand, no one was prepared to make such a bold claim. Tiger eats, shoots and punctuates questions Having just admonished the media as a whole for the publication by the Dubliner magazine of a salacious tale about his wife Ellen Nordgren, Tiger Woods' sensitivity radar was set to hyper. So when one member of the profession inquired quite innocently about the United States team's sing-song on Tuesday night, he met with a surprising response. It would appear, and this is one for Lynne Truss, that the secret of asking the world No1 a question is to use the appropriate punctuation. Saying: \"I read this morning about the US team drinking Guinness and singing songs,\" sounds okay. But Woods heard what he wanted to. \"This morning? Maybe you were drinking this morning.\" Taxi drivers' protest is put off for the tee-off Travelling to the K Club could not be best described as easy, given the security perimeter surrounding the course, which makes arriving by anything other than helicopter less than convenient. At least arriving in Dublin will be stress-free after the city's taxi drivers called off their threat of strike action. The unions are unhappy about the introduction of a new fare structure for those using Dublin airport and planned to halt services today in protest. With thousands of fans to shuttle to and from their hotels, they decided yesterday to postpone their protest. Lehman makes a play for the hearts of Ireland The United States captain Tom Lehman, left, has been accused of thinking of everything in his preparation for this Ryder Cup. And with good reason - Lehman has waged a charm offensive in the build-up to the event. But perhaps his most subtle play for hearts and minds has been with the home crowd. On the bottom of the US players' golf bags he made sure there was a green shamrock, just in case any natives were thinking of switching sides."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
