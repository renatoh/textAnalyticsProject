This seems to mythologise Nixon as a romantic loner, but it's a fair summary from this thorough, revisionist biography. Black's historical sense is impressive, but this huge book suffers from a grandiose style. Southern California, Nixon's birthplace, is a 'surging Babylon'; JFK, 'the allegory of revitalization'. And what on earth, Lord Black, is an 'Invincible Quest'? Nixon's rehabilitation still has some way to go. His domestic successes, and diplomacy with Russia and China, will always be tainted by secret bombings in Cambodia, the bandwagon anti-communism and Watergate. Those too are Nixon's legacy. With only Black to go by, you would think that his biggest mistake was getting caught. Wild: An Elemental Journey, by Jay Griffiths (Penguin \u00a38.99) Wild lives up to its title. In pursuit of wild landscape and living - 'the feral angel' - Jay Griffiths explored the world's elements, living with Amazonian tribes and the Inuit, following songlines, learning the land, going to the source. The result is a crazy, twisting travelogue, unstoppably digressive, overgrown with tangled word-roots, charged with faith in language and the natural world, outraged at globalisation, in love with the noble savage. As Griffiths prowls exhaustingly from pole to desert, you begin to wish for some versions of wildness closer to home - heaths and verges, riverbanks, neglected ground - if only to avoid a travel guide fetish for the exotic. But Wild is a cri de coeur: there are those who love wildness, and those who do not. You are 'for life or against it': Greenpeace or the golf course. Four Seasons in Rome, by Anthony Doerr (Fourth Estate \u00a38.99) Those who love Rome know it as a city where beauty appears from nowhere, unexpectedly. That's also how novelist Anthony Doerr's year there began: on the same day that he became a father to twins, he was awarded a fellowship at the American Academy, an invitation to sojourn in the Eternal City. Doerr begins shakily, the wide-eyed innocent American abroad. Yet he writes perceptively about strangeness: the tiny oddities of a foreign city, the terror of a foreign hospital. He longs to see snow fall in the Pantheon, and awaits the election of a new Pope. Doerr's young twins are at the heart of the book, which is just as it should be. He doesn't make too much of the coincidence, but they are ever present, latter-day counterparts of Romulus and Remus, the founding foundlings of the city. The Ministry of Special Cases, by Nathan Englander (Faber \u00a37.99) Under military rule in the late 1970s, Argentinians wake up to find tanks in the streets, neighbours 'disappeared'. It's a dangerous time for the Jews of Buenos Aires, and an opportunity for the improbably named Kaddish, who makes a living chipping names from the gravestones of the undesirable dead, saving the living from persecution by erasing inconvenient ancestors. The polished, irreverent and tragic short stories in For the Relief of Unbearable Urges won a devoted following for Nathan Englander, and The Ministry of Special Cases begins confidently in the same comic mode. Yet the story of the disappearances, including that of Kaddish's son, shows the range of Englander's talent, with dark ironies troubling its absurd set-pieces and magical realism yoked to true tragedy. Prince Rupert: The Last Cavalier, by Charles Spencer (Phoenix \u00a310.99) He was one of the wildest, luckiest Cavalier leaders of the English Civil War. Pepys disliked him and thought that 'a clap of the pox' had 'eaten to his head'. Rupert of the Rhine proves a beguiling figure in this lively and detailed biography by Charles Spencer. Son of the exiled and disgraced King of Bohemia, Rupert was by turns a soldier, an inventor, a trader with the north American colonies, a Caribbean pirate and an Admiral of Charles II's fleet against the Dutch. With this material, it's easy to get carried away. Did Rupert really invent a primitive torpedo? Was Pepys just an 'inspired naval bureaucrat'? Spencer attends to the poetry and art of Rupert's milieu as well as to military exploits, and though he admits to some of Rupert's shortcomings, he writes with evident fondness for the charismatic prince."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
