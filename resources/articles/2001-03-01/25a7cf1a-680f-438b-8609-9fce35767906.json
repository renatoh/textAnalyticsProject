Following the next election, the chancellor of the exchequer will have to decide what structural measures need to be taken to deliver fully the promises to reduce poverty in general and child poverty in particular during this decade. In the first half of this parliament, there has been plentiful evidence, despite the New Deal, working families tax credit, the national minimum wage and the pensioners' minimum income guarantee, that the incomes of rich and poor were still edging apart and poverty growing. The end of the last century saw the highest ever number of people in poverty. The Department of Social Security's latest annual survey of households below average income shows that the numbers in poverty (according to the measure favoured in the government's first audit of poverty) grew from 14.1m in 1996-7 to 14.3m in 1998-9 (the highest total ever). Northern Ireland figures, if available, would add to this total. The chancellor has now made important concessions to the need for vertical redistribution (between different income brackets). In this Budget and the last, he acknowledged public dismay at his abolition of the lone parent's premium and his early references to the possibility of taxing child benefit, the failure to raise the real level of the basic state pension and the punitive changes to incapacity benefit. The package of Budget measures for families with children (children's tax credit, maternity pay, income support and working families tax credit), the increase in the minimum wage and the package for pensioners (increases of \u00a35 and \u00a38 to the basic state retirement pension for single and couple pensioners, and payment of the minimum income guarantee at the highest rate of \u00a392.15, plus tax concessions for those with small incomes), will undoubtedly make a difference. But the outcome has still to be demonstrated. What happens in 2000 and 2001 will not be known statistically until 2002 and 2003. Expert modelling suggests that 1.2m of 4.4m children will be taken out of poverty. Such forecasts are optimistic. The number is more likely to be between half a million and three-quarters of a million - good, but many fewer than hoped for. The dynamics of income and horizontal redistribution (between groups broadly within the same income brackets) are not sufficiently taken into account. Earnings have been getting more unequal, and the trend is set to continue. Compensation for low earnings may have to grow faster than so far believed to improve historical neglect and to compensate for falling low income. The shift from universal or categorical benefits to means-tested benefits, including the tax credits and the minimum income guarantee, depends for success on take-up. And there are signs of serious problems of coverage, as well as loss or reduction of other means-tested benefits. In assessing outcome, there is also the need to allow for the chancellor's trade-offs. Working families tax credit takes over from family credit, children's tax credit from the married tax allowance, and parts of other means-tested benefits from clamps on non-means-tested benefits such as national insurance. On the basis of written answers to parliamentary questions, I calculate that the chancellor has redistributed a little under half of 1% of GDP to support for children (from 1.5% of GDP in 1997-98 to 1.9% in 2001-2). Again, good, but still too modest. The government's anti-poverty strategy needs to depend on good European and not merely American models. During the last 20 years, the UK has become - as international agencies have testified - odd man out in Europe, experiencing faster growth in both inequality and poverty than any other member state. A successful strategy also depends on containing excessive increases in high incomes and diverting resources to good purposes. For more than two decades, the rich have had percentage increases in their wealth and income much larger - in some years more than four times larger - than average. In the last four years, that trend has not slowed, still less reversed. Social polarisation has become a remorseless trend under successive governments and is a source of long-run instability. The chancellor is keeping hopes alive of the next government making serious inroads into poverty. But success depends on substantially raising benefit levels, especially for those not in paid work - the elderly, disabled people and children. \u0095 Professor Peter Townsend is the centennial professor of international social policy at the LSE and co-author of Breadline Europe: The Measurement of Poverty, The Policy Press (2001)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
