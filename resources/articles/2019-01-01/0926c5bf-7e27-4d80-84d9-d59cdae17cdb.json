Solanke completed a \u00a317m move from Liverpool to Bournemouth last week, a fee that is somewhat remarkable given the 21-year-old\u2019s playing record \u2013 one 17-minute substitute appearance for Chelsea in October 2014 followed by 21 appearances, 16 of which came off the bench, and only one goal scored for Liverpool having moved there in May 2017. He did score seven goals in 25 Eredivisie appearances during a loan spell at Vitesse Arnhem, while at Chelsea, and was also a key part of the England Under-20 squad who won the World Cup in 2017. As such, he backs himself to be a success at Bournemouth and views his decision to join Eddie Howe\u2019s side as part of a wider trend that began when Sancho moved from Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund two summers ago. The winger was deemed by some to have taken a risk but he has thrived at the Bundesliga leaders and has gone on to become part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior setup. \u201cThat [Sancho\u2019s success at Dortmund] has affected everyone,\u201d said Solanke, who has one England cap. \u201cWhen one young player sees another young player doing that they think they can do it as well, especially when everyone is playing at international level together. Sancho is doing well in Germany and a lot of players would like to follow his path. What he\u2019s done, getting into the England team at such a young age, it will influence a lot of young players.\u201d Callum Hudson-Odoi could become the next young domestic talent to leave one of England\u2019s biggest clubs in order to gain first-team football, with the 18-year-old Chelsea winger the subject of a \u00a335m bid from Bayern Munich and supposedly keen to make the switch given he has yet to start a Premier League game for Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side. \u201cI think every footballer just wants to play,\u201d said Solanke when commenting on his own lack of opportunities at Stamford Bridge, as well as at Anfield. \u201cYou want to show what you can do and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to playing here.\u201d Solanke will have to wait for that opportunity given he is still recovering from the muscle injury that meant a move to Crystal Palace fell through at the start of the month. In contrast, Nathaniel Clyne is already up and running for Bournemouth having also joined the club from Liverpool on a loan deal that runs until the end of the season. The right-back started last week\u2019s FA Cup third-round defeat to Brighton and is in line to do the same against Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday. Like Solanke, Clyne is enthused by the prospect of regular first-team football at Bournemouth having struggled for that at Anfield. Speaking alongside the striker on Friday, the 27-year-old also dismissed claims from Neil Warnock that he had already agreed to join Cardiff before moving to the south coast. Warnock last week accused Liverpool of \u201clacking class\u201d over Clyne\u2019s situation before going on to describe himself as \u201cdisappointed\u201d, having given the player his first taste of first-team football while manager of Crystal Palace in 2008. \u201cNothing was agreed,\u201d insisted Clyne. \u201cIt was just talks, really, between my agent and the clubs, and ultimately I made the decision to come to Bournemouth. I\u2019m just fully focused now on training and playing for Bournemouth.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
