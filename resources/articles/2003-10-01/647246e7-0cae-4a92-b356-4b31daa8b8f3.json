The DTI's decision to clear the merger of Carlton and Granada last week has upped the ante for rival broadcasters, who are to discuss the possibility of collaborating on airtime sales. They must await the outcome of a review of the airtime sales market by media watchdog Ofcom. But sources at the companies say they will need to consolidate to bolster their falling share of advertising revenue. Commercial chiefs at the broadcasters are set to discuss their formal approach to consolidation in the coming weeks. Channel 4, Five and Sky asked the Government to block the merger of Carlton and Granada, claiming the new company would be anti-competitive. Now the merger has gone through with few curbs, broadcasters are determined to safeguard their slice of the TV airtime market. Channel 4, which has a remit to provide diverse public service programming, is believed to have had initial concerns about joint sales with the more populist Sky channels and Five. But sources from Channel 4 and Five have indicated that the power of a merged Carlton and Granada sales house will be such that they will be forced to collaborate to give advertisers the clout they seek. Five station boss Jane Lighting is under particular pressure to make the channel more attractive to advertisers, following the departure of a number of key executives 'There is no way anyone is going to want to work in airtime sales unless we are given some defence against an all-powerful ITV sales operation,' said one insider. Current broadcasting rules prohibit joint selling, but the ITV merger has forced Ofcom to revise the rules. Ofcom has asked parties to submit their views by mid-November, after which a wider review of the way advertising airtime is sold could be triggered. Ofcom conceded that there was a pressing need to review the implications of the ITV merger for the way advertising was sold. 'There is an important policy objective for Ofcom, which is the maintenance of fair and effective competition in the TV advertising market,' said a spokesman. But officials would not be drawn on Ofcom's views on the potential consolidation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
