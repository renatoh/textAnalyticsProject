According to Johnson, police drove by, stopped their car, then accused him of looking like a drug dealer. The 32-year-old was an actor, about to perform in a May 2017 production of Sorry! No Coloureds, No Irish, No Dogs which was aimed at galvanising debate on institutionalised racism and unconscious bias. Police officers in Dorset frequently suspect that black men like Johnson deal drugs. In fact, if you are black and in Dorset you are 26.5 times more likely than a white person to be stopped and searched for drugs, and 20.4 times more likely to be targeted . The incident Johnson describes happened three years after Theresa May, then home secretary, told parliament that the misuse of stop and search was \u201cunfair, especially to young black men\u201d and unveiled a package of reforms to correct longstanding ethnic disparities. Her intervention on such a divisive issue signalled her ambition to be seen as a more liberal, inclusive home secretary who was not afraid to take on the police. Yet a comprehensive new analysis of the criminal justice system reveals such reform has failed to address racial bias. Rather, it documents a disquieting increase in ethnic disparity in the policing and prosecution of drug offences. The disproportional use of stop and search is now at its most pronounced since the power was introduced in 1984. The analysis reaches a troubling conclusion: the criminal justice system in England and Wales is increasingly weighted towards a \u201cfictitious narrative\u201d that drug use is especially prevalent among black and minority ethnic groups. Published today by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and Stopwatch \u2013 a coalition of academics, lawyers, civil society organisations \u2013 along with Release, a centre of expertise on drugs and drugs law, the study reveals that black people were stopped and searched at more than eight times the rate of white people in 2016/17. All 43 forces in England and Wales targeted black people using stop and search at a higher rate than white people. Rebekah Delsol, co-author of the 88-page report, called for the introduction of legislation to curb the use of stop and search. \u201cForces that cannot use stop and search fairly and effectively should have the powers taken away from them until they can show that they can be trusted to use these powers appropriately.\u201d She added: \u201cThe police are clearly unable or unwilling to deal with the problem and a solution needs to come from elsewhere. It is shocking that the situation has got worse, not better.\u201d The analysis also shows that stop and search is increasingly used to find drugs, with almost two-thirds of stop-searches targeted at illegal substances \u2013 up from half in 2010/11. But this increased focus has meant that black people were stopped and searched for drugs at almost nine times the rate of whites \u2013 despite data that white people are likelier to be found carrying drugs. The fact that the \u201cfind\u201d rate for drugs is lower for black people offers proof, say experts, that such searches are conducted on the basis of \u201cweaker grounds\u201d for black people. Further down the criminal justice system \u2013 and against a backdrop of mounting calls to decriminalise cannabis possession \u2013 black people were convicted of cannabis possession at almost 12 times the rate of white people, the analysis found. It also reveals that black people made up a quarter of those convicted of cannabis possession, despite making up less than 4% of the population. The proportion is even more striking as it is considered that black people report using cannabis at slightly more than half the rate of white people. Overall, more black people were prosecuted last year for cannabis possession than the supply of Class A or B substances combined \u2013 with the balance reversed for white people. Zoe Carre, another author of the report, stated: \u201cThis is an appalling indictment of the criminal justice system, which is acting as a conveyer belt for the criminalisation of young black people for low-level offending, while treating white people more leniently for the same offences.\u201d Elsewhere the data, also examined and collated by the LSE\u2019s international drugs policy unit which works closely with governments on the issue, reveals that black people were sentenced to immediate custody for drug offences at 9.1 times the rate of white people. The findings of the study are likely to prompt renewed calls for a new approach to challenging racial inequality in the criminal justice system. Although May\u2019s parliamentary promise in 2014 pre-empted a sizeable reduction in the use of stop and search, the number of arrests of black people for drugs has not fallen, according to the research. Niamh Eastwood, executive director of Release, said: \u201cIf Theresa May is serious about tackling racial disparity in the criminal justice system then she has to address drug law enforcement, which she has abjectly failed to do.\u201d In London disproportionality is highest in boroughs of extreme inequality. In Kensington and Chelsea a black person is 6.9 times more likely to be stopped than a white person, compared with 1.8 in Newham, one of the capital\u2019s most multicultural boroughs. \u201cThis pattern is consistent with ethnic profiling because it indicates that black people are being singled out for suspicion,\u201d said the report. Stop and search also accounts for a much larger proportion of arrests of black than white people: 17% compared with 5% for all offences, and 57% compared with 31% for drug offences. Such disparities, said the study, indicate that the disproportionate application of stop and search is a function of policy and decision-making rather than crime. Localised decision-making has also led to dramatic variations regarding the focus on drugs, with 82% of stop and searches in Merseyside authorised for drugs compared with 46% in Durham, the lowest proportion. Despite accusations that stop and search penalises black and other ethnic minorities, some - including the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick - have recently called for its deployment to be increased."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
