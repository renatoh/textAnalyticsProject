In 1992 I got my A-level results. I remember the nights of dread which I would call sleepless were it not for the memory of waking up from sweaty nightmares about having an Edexcel examiner's boot stamping on my face forever. I remember opening the envelope with nerveless fingers and the waves of sweet, sweet relief when I saw that the sacrifice of a social life (albeit one already fairly brutally curtailed by the intractable triumvirate of orthodontics, glasses and the kind of skin that made me wonder why Opec hadn't offered to buy my sebaceous glands) had resulted in grades that would earn me a place at university instead of a sustained beating from my mother. But I don't remember my greatest (all right, only) personal achievement to date being denounced in the press days later as the result of plummeting standards, corruption in the educational ranks and the unwillingness of bleeding-hearted liberal pedagogues to damage adolescent self-esteem with accurate marking, or lauded by the government and teachers as incontrovertible evidence of their own increasing brilliance at enabling even the most troglodytic of youngsters to get a lumpen foot on the academic ladder. Perhaps it was already an established tradition and my ignorance of it just one of the unsung benefits of youthful solipsism, but my sister's results came in three years later and she certainly noticed that it had been clasped lovingly to the national bosom by then, where it nestles snugly still. This year's results are, for the 22nd time, an improvement on the previous year's and the usual suspects have piled gleefully in with their explanations, justifications and denigrations according to taste. I can never decide whether this annual spectacle demonstrates an impressive degree of scepticism about statistics or whether it's another depressing manifestation of our essentially pessimistic national character. On the one hand, there does seem to be something faintly suspicious about an unfaltering two-decade increase in exam pass rates, and you can't help but imagine a clandestine meeting taking place every August between exam board representatives and some shadowy figures from the department of education: \"Yes, Brian, I know you can only fool all of the people some of the time. Yes, we're on course for a 130% pass rate by 2010, but are you going to deal with the flak we'll get if we announce a 0.8% drop this year? All those in favour of being burned alive inside a giant wicker man say 'Aye.' All those in favour of another increase, say 'Aye.' Good lad, Brian.\" On the other hand, there is something perverse about our readiness to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and our eagerness in thinking that everything is sliding unstoppably into a necrotic pit of our own devising. It's the same collective penchant for doom-mongering that means disasters such as the Dome, Tim Henman and the Connex timetable actually bring more happiness to their countrymen than the Sydney opera house, Pete Sampras and the TGV could ever hope to bring to theirs. That's not to deny that there are problems with A-levels. They have historically been the preserve of that slim slice of the population who are not just bright but good at distilling evidence of their cleverness into three-hour bursts of neat handwriting under exam conditions. Although the undue emphasis placed on this useful but narrow talent has lessened in recent years, thanks to coursework and modular re-structuring, a snobbery still attaches to the qualification which is still seen as the only valid passport to a \"proper\" degree at a \"good\" university. This in turn ensures that there is still no real public belief (or, one suspects in the light of long-promised but never actually delivered systemic reform, gubernatorial belief) that alternative, vocational courses catering for those with equally impressive but non-academic talents should be accorded the same respect and resources as traditional A-levels. But perhaps if it could we might end up in a situation where nursery nurses, to pick an example not entirely at random, are properly trained and, knowing that others value their work, will no longer need to vent nameless frustrations on their infant charges. And if this sea-change can be brought about without recourse to the annual scorning of successful A-levellers in the process, then gold stars all round."}, "isHosted": false}}}
