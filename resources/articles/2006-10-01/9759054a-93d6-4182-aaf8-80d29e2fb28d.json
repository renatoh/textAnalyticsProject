Asked to comment on a statement by a spokesman for Wayne Rooney, the FA's director of communications, Adrian Bevington, replied, \"I will have to speak to Wayne Rooney's spokesman about that\". Yes, at last we had reached that happy day when spokesman shall speak peace unto spokesman. Some, of course, will not be so cheerful. Like me, they will wonder why, at the dawn of the 21st century, the FA's director of communications is reduced to communicating on his own behalf. In this day and age there is simply no reason why any senior figure in English football should be talking at all when there are so many folk around who are willing to talk for them. Last week, for instance, we were lucky enough to hear Max Clifford getting Steve McClaren's feelings off his chest for him. And quite right, too, it's a matter of human dignity. The Bevington situation has not gone unnoticed with the England squad, of course. Apparently, the FA spokesman has been getting a considerable amount of stick from the players. Or rather he has been getting considerable stick from the players' stickmen, the professional ribbers, japesters and wind-up merchants many stars now employ to engage in dressing-room banter, cafe-bar crack and the odd bout of poo-in-a- shoe-related horseplay on their behalf. These days the top players do not even do their own Little Britain impressions, and they leave the cutting off of the centre-back's flashy ties to one of their people. This is not because they are lazy. It is because they are focused. The modern player is a specialist. He has little time for anything other than honing the key skills of his profession: shooting, shouting and looking sultry in styling mousse. Nothing distracts him from his job. He has a ghostwriter to write his autobiography and a ghostreader to tell him what is in it. Some of the biggest names are now so totally devoted to themselves that they even employ a staff of experts to sleep with women for them. \"Clearly the players are red-blooded young men who would like nothing better than to chase skirt,\" reveals one insider close to the source of a friend, \"but as professional athletes they are worried that a night of vigorous heterosexual activity might mess up their aggression, their stamina, or even their hair.\" Some have gone one-step further. A lot of fans and media people have expressed the view that Rooney is experiencing a lack of form. They are quite wrong. Wayne is in the form of his life. Unfortunately his body double is going through a sticky patch, though admittedly not as sticky as the one Frank Lampard's body double has been experiencing for the past five months. Some will find the news that Rooney and Lampard actually have body doubles out on the field something of a surprise. It is hard to see why. It has been common practice in Hollywood for years. You wouldn't expect Angelina Jolie to do her own stunts, or Mel Gibson to show you his own bottom, now would you? Like any movie star Wayne is an incredibly valuable asset. Neither Manchester United nor England can afford to put what we must learn to call \"the core of the Rooney brand\" at risk by actually allowing him to run around on a slippery surface with a lot of rough blokes. The insurance premiums if they did would be crippling. His beard alone had to be underwritten for \u00a377m. The presence of spokesmen, agents, image consultants, financial advisers and a legal team at Casa Roonaldo have inevitably lead to many implausible rumours. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that Rooney does not actually exist. According to them the Boy Genius of the River Mersey is, like football itself, a mere concept around which an industry has solidified. \"It's like basically there's all these people, right?\" said a spokesperson for Coleen McLoughlin's personal shopper's personal assistant's personal secretary, \"and in the middle there's this sort of kind of a big hole, OK? Well, that big hole is exactly the shape of Wayne.\" The rumour of Rooney's non-existence was categorically denied by associates of a leaked brief whose representative preferred not to be named. \"Rooney is far from being a big hole,\" he said, \"but if he was a big hole he would be the biggest hole in the business, believe me, which I wouldn't if I were you\". A spokesman for Rooney also moved to apply ice and arnica to the swelling bruise of innuendo: \"The critics can say what they like through whoever they wish. My client is unconcerned. He knows that what counts is what happens on the pitch. Wayne is a man who believes in letting other people's football do the talking and he always will as long as I am speaking for him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
