But not quite yet. There is one day of Championship cricket left and the second division title still hangs seductively within the reach of either Essex, who need 211 more runs, or Nottinghamshire, who need eight more wickets. The more sentimental would be crossing their fingers for Notts, for the sake of Paul Johnson. He retires today, after 21 years, 20,256 runs and countless acrobatic exhibitions around the boundaries. He leaves without any hair but with runs by the bucket-load. He lies 10th on the list of Nottinghamshire's all-time scorers. The sun really did come out as he made his final walk to the wicket, but there was to be no fairytale farewell. Just a squat smile, 16 balls and three sharp fours, before he edged behind one last time. The Nottinghamshire balcony joined the crowd in standing as he trudged slowly back, but they have not seen the back of him. He is retiring only to the back room where he will become club coach, specialising in batting and fielding. What he left behind him at the wicket was youth. Bilal Shafayat is only 18, and has played in only five Championship matches, but he already looks a star. He made his debut century at Worcester last week and followed it up here with an important fifty. He is so tiny that his bat dwarfs him like an oversized stetson, but he wields it like a conductor. And in 21 overs he and Paul Franks took the game away from Essex, putting on 87 as the fielding heads started to sag and Graham Gooch's desire to snap up an overseas fast bowler began to become clear. They managed to drop Shafayat twice and 38 extras glued themselves to the scorecard. Just to rub things in Stuart MacGill and Greg Smith decided to compete to play the most ridiculous shot with their eyes closed and added 22 for the last wicket. As the light faded a rapt crowd watched MacGill walking in past the dark green fairy rings and whipping his wrist as he turned out top-spinner and leg-break to Mark Waugh. This duel will not be available in the winter. When it works, county cricket is wonderful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
