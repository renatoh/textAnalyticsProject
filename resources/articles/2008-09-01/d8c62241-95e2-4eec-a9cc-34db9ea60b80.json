This is an insider's view of the pressures of life and crime that plague ordinary Chinese people, and of the corruption of police and local authorities who exploit the population. Private investigator Song Ren is not allowed to investigate crimes, but he gets involved in the tragic case of a man who throws himself off a building, leaving behind the frozen body of his murdered child. The ups and downs of his investigation make this not only an outstanding thriller, but also a powerfully informative read. Sampson, a former BBC and Times correspondent in Beijing, peels the lid off a putrid tale of murder and child abduction that is a growth industry in China. Tightly written and quite compelling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
