The Cosmic Crisp\u2019s release comes after two decades of development and some three years of planting apple trees. Washington state farmers have exclusive growing rights for one decade, according to local media outlet KIMA. The apple, developed by Washington State University\u2019s fruit tree breeding program and first cultivated in 1997, purports to have a \u201cremarkably firm and crisp texture\u201d and be \u201csurprisingly sweet, making it an excellent eating apple\u201d, according to its website. The launch has reportedly cost $10m. The fruit, a cross between the Enterprise and Honeycrisp apple varieties, was bred to feature \u201cnaturally higher levels of acidity and sugar,\u201d so much so that one can use less sugar while baking, researchers claim. They also say that it\u2019s \u201cnaturally slow to brown when cut and maintains its texture and flavor in storage for more than a year\u201d. Its name stems from the tiny bright dots on the apple\u2019s otherwise darker red skin. Tasters said the flecks reminded them of \u201couter space and the cosmos,\u201d Cosmic Crisp\u2019s website noted. Just over 450,000 40lb boxes of the Cosmic Crisp crop were expected to be shipped to retailers across the US on Sunday, according to the Spokane-based Spokesman-Review. The producers hope the shipments will grow to 2.1m boxes in 2020. For those who can\u2019t wait for their local grocery store to stock them, four apples were retailing for $39 online over the weekend. The initial 600,000 Cosmic Crisp trees were sold to farmers in 2017, researchers reportedly said. Since then, more than 10m Cosmic Crisp trees were planted, Kate Evans, who heads the university\u2019s Pome Fruit Breeding Program, told the Spokesman-Review. Asked for comment on the apple\u2019s release, Evans told the Guardian in an email it\u2019s \u201cvery exciting to finally see it available for consumers\u201d. Addressing skepticism about the apple, Evans emphasized that Cosmic Crisp was not made through genetic modification but instead, a technique named \u201ccross-hybridization\u201d. Evans said the idea of crossing the two varieties was to make an apple that featured both Enterprise\u2019s resistance to browning and disease and Honeycrisp\u2019s sweet flavour. Washington is the top apple producing state in the US, and Gala and Red Delicious are the most popular varieties sold. Scott McIlrath, a grower who planted 5,000 Cosmic Crisp trees, told Kima: \u201cI think that will benefit all varieties and the apple growers as a whole.\u201d But, he noted, \u201cthe real impact of cosmic crisp sales won\u2019t be felt to the farmer for another two to three years\u201d.\ufeff"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
