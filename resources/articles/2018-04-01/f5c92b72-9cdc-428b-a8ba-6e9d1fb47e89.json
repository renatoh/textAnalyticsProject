For some of the athletes, the sight of a guide dog snoozing at poolside was incongruous \u2013 as was the realisation they were being snapped by a visually impaired photographer. \u201cPeople see me with a dog and they see me with a big camera and they go, \u2018Am I seeing this right?!\u2019\u201d says Follows, who has spent the past week shooting at the Commonwealth Games. \u201cThe medal winners were all looking down at Leo and he\u2019s asleep; he doesn\u2019t have a care in the world. \u201cShooting the Games has been epic, absolutely epic,\u201d he adds. \u201cFrom the opening ceremony to the end of the swimming finals, I\u2019ve captured some really magic moments.\u201d Main portrait of Andrew Follows and Leo by Carly Earl for the Guardian The 56-year-old from Melbourne was born with a form of retinitis pigmentosa, a rare genetic disorder in which the cells of the retina are unable to sufficiently process light. Blind in one eye, his vision in the other is so poor he cannot rely on it to compose or time his images. \u201cI\u2019ve had retinitis pigmentosa from birth so I\u2019ve never had good eyesight,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got no vision in my left eye and in my right eye I\u2019ve got tunnel vision with about three metres of clear vision \u2013 the average person has 70 metres \u2013 so it\u2019s pretty crap. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve developed techniques [for making photographs] and it works well for the swimming, especially. I\u2019m using my hearing to follow the sound of the water splashing and the crowd. \u201cYou know that the end of the race is coming when the crowd gets louder and louder and louder. I just focus the camera on the end blocks and start pressing that shutter button. I\u2019m not seeing the results until I see them on the computer but I get really excited when I see them.\u201d Indeed, Follows credits digital photography as being a transformative influence in his life. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved in photography, even back in the old film days,\u201d he says, \u201cbut since I bought my first digital camera in 2006 it\u2019s opened up a whole new world of vision because you take the photos, you put the card into the computer, and all of a sudden you can see a lot clearer the shapes and textures and expressions on people\u2019s faces \u2013 everything \u2013 so the camera has really become my eyes and allowed me to see what everybody else can see. I deeply love photography. It\u2019s my passion now.\u201d Follows is one of a growing legion of visually impaired photographers around the world and it is thanks to his friend, the photographer Delly Carr, that he was granted a media pass for the Games. His guide dog is fairly new to the role of assistant photographer but it\u2019s work to which he\u2019s perfectly suited. Leo even has his own media credentials and the ID number 007. \u201cI\u2019ve only had him nine months but he\u2019s totally, 100% devoted to me. He utterly adores me and he just goes with the flow. He nailed it around the Games\u201d \u2013 even if he did spend half of it sleeping. All pictures below by Andrew Follows Swimmers dive into the pool at the start of a race.
