Mrs Gandhi won a byelection by more than 400,000 votes in Uttar Pradesh. Congress, which leads India's coalition government, lost overall control in Assam, and Kerala fell to a Communist-led bloc. A Congress ally won in Tamil Nadu and the Communists held their West Bengal bastion for the seventh consecutive time. Congress held only the tiny state of Pondicherry. More than 130 million people voted in the polls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
