They certainly seem to be at work behind his latest offering, the soundtrack to Paul Thomas Anderson's acclaimed new film, There Will Be Blood, due for release in the UK next February. Writing music for film is fantastically detailed work, often matching the action frame for frame, but Greenwood has chosen a different approach. 'I saw some fairly long sections of the film, read the script and just wrote loads of music,' he said recently. 'I tried to write to the scenery and the story rather than specific themes for characters. Only a couple of parts were written for specific scenes. I was happier writing lots of music and having Paul Thomas Anderson fit some of it to the film.' The result is a bit of a mish-mash of 11 short 'movements' with baffling titles such as 'Eat Him By His Own Light' and 'HW/Hope In The New Fields'. No doubt, all will become clear once the film is released. It's drawn from Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! and is described as 'a stark period piece filmed on arid Texas plains'. Those arid plains are captured impressively in the opening track 'Open Spaces', which employs what is fast becoming Greenwood's 'signature', the Ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument. Its oscillating frequencies have just the right haunting, vocal quality to evoke an empty, forbidding landscape. Greenwood's quest for a voice is fascinating. Some of his pieces on this tiny album (it's barely 37 minutes long) are truly engaging, particularly his writing for string quartet, and some, but not many, are just plain dull. It's as though he is experimenting all the time; trying new approaches, new styles. It's a bumpy ride but we should be glad he's taking it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
