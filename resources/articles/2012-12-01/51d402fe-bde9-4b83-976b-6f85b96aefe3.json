The league leaders' 13 wins and a draw from their opening 14 fixtures surpasses Real Madrid's 12 wins and two draws at the beginning of the 1991-92 campaign. The milestone, unmatched in 81 previous seasons, has come in the first year of Tito Vilanova's tenure as manager . Messi's 11th double-strike of the season leaves him one goal shy of Gerd M\u00fcller's record of 85 for club and country in one calendar year, set in 1972. Barcelona led 3-0 at half-time thanks to goals by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, Messi and Adriano. Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Messi, again, then also scored in the second-half. Bilbao did their best early on to fight for possession with Barcelona, and with their passing game checked the hosts were forced to turn to a set piece to break through \u2013 Piqu\u00e9 pouncing on 22 minutes after the visitors had failed to fully clear F\u00e1bregas's corner. Messi struck for the first time three minutes later before Adriano also scored following a through pass from F\u00e1bregas. The former Arsenal captain scored himself on 57 minutes after collecting a pass from Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Messi made it 5-1 on 70 minutes following a goal from Ibai G\u00f3mez for Bilbao."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
