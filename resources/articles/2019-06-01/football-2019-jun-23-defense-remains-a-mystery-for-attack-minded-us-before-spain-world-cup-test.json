That\u2019s why a reporter thought Carli Lloyd could fill in the gaps: what should the world know about USA\u2019s starting goalkeeper? \u201cI think Alyssa Naeher doesn\u2019t want anybody to know about Alyssa Naeher,\u201d Lloyd said, laughing. Naeher is USA\u2019s first World Cup starter in goal not named Hope Solo or Briana Scurry in two decades and, although casual fans may be unfamiliar with the spotlight-shy goalkeeper now, she will eventually step out of the shadows of Solo and Scurry. Either because she will finally concede a goal in this tournament, or because she will save USA\u2019s hide. Neither has happened yet, but with the US facing Spain in the last 16 on Monday, both those scenarios are coming into view. Although Sweden were supposed to be the first \u201creal\u201d test of the US back line, the Swedes were already through to the knockout round and content to rest top players when the two teams met last Thursday. Spain, meanwhile, will be playing for their World Cup lives. If the stats are to be believed, Spain underperformed during the group stage. Their expected non-penalty goals was around 5.5, eighth best in the tournament, but they instead scored just once from open play, according to InStat. If Spain sharpen their finishing, they could be a handful for the Americans \u2013 and for Naeher. Spain\u2019s only loss in this World Cup came by a single goal to superpower Germany, and they are one of the emerging teams in women\u2019s football. Spain won and came second in the U-17 and U-20 World Cups respectively, and there is hope that the senior side can make a leap forward of their own. What separates Spain from some other countries is that their tiki-taka, free-flowing style permeates the entire program \u2013 from the men\u2019s side to the women\u2019s side, at the senior level and on down to the youth teams. The Americans faced Spain in a friendly in January, and a narrow 1-0 win for the US shows the reigning champions cannot expect a walkover. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there in January when we played them but I watched on TV and I thought they were really, really good technically and really understood their relationships,\u201d said defender Ali Krieger. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to break [them] down.\u201d Indeed, it is the US who may be the easiest of the two to break down. When they have faced top teams this year, they have conceded multiple goals more often than not. They are yet to concede in this World Cup, but they also haven\u2019t been challenged much either, facing few shots on target \u2013 and those that Naeher did handle were straight at her. Perhaps the most memorable play Naeher has made so far came in the group match against Chile when she whiffed on a ball, which allowed the South Americans to score a goal that was eventually waved offside. Naeher admitted afterward she didn\u2019t know if it was offside and was trying to make a play. Although the error didn\u2019t end up hurting the US, it fit neatly into a narrative questioning if the shy and reserved Naeher has a strong enough mentality to be the USA goalkeeper after the confident and outgoing Scurry and Solo dominated for so long. Even Scurry herself has raised the question. \u201cShe\u2019s incredibly talented \u2013 she has great athletic ability and she\u2019s very good with her feet. The only question I would have is, how is she going to perform when it\u2019s really stressful,\u201d Scurry told the Guardian in April. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d It was never going to be easy for Naeher to replace Solo, who holds the world record for clean sheets at international level. Solo was a superior shot-stopper and won the Golden Glove at the previous two World Cups. If Solo hadn\u2019t been kicked off the team for being a thorn in her federation\u2019s side, it\u2019s a good bet that she would still be the team\u2019s starting goalkeeper. But Naeher\u2019s teammates have defended her at every turn. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Julie Ertz when asked before the tournament if the questioning of Naeher is annoying. \u201cNo one\u2019s just given her time yet. We know who she is. We train with her every single day. We know how good she is.\u201d The US did not concede in the group stage of this World Cup \u2013 the first time they have achieved that feat in their history. Becky Sauerbrunn hopes it will be enough to silence the critics. \u201cI\u2019ve thought that Alyssa has been an amazing goalkeeper for a really long time,\u201d Sauerbrunn said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it\u2019s taken everyone else time to see it, because I see her in training day in and day out, I see her in the weight room, I see what she does, and she\u2019s come into owning that position so much.\u201d The USA\u2019s defensive problems, however, are not solely down to Naeher. On average, she\u2019s facing more shots than Solo did during her career, and is being asked to make up for a back line that plays a far more attacking style than Solo\u2019s defense did in 2015. Crystal Dunn, an ultra-attacking left back, conceded before the World Cup that \u201cthere are risks that are taken with the way we play\u201d because the Americans commit so many numbers forward. The risk is high but so is the reward, and it has worked for the Americans so far as they continue to score at an impressive clip. They are confident that their attack-first philosophy can carry them to the World Cup final. \u201cIt\u2019s the cohesiveness,\u201d Krieger said on Saturday of the US defense \u201cWithin the line, we\u2019re constantly supporting each other and finding little things to help them improve. At half-time, it\u2019s \u2018Hey, what did you see? Can we adjust anything?\u2019\u201d There hasn\u2019t been too much to talk about through the group stage. But in the knockout rounds, of course, anything can happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
