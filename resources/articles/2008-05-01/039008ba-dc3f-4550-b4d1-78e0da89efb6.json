The club's billionaire owner, in attendance for the first time since the victory over Arsenal on March 23 which had fired hopes of the championship, intends to be in more celebratory mood on Wednesday week. \"He congratulated everyone; he respected what we did this season,\" said the manager, Avram Grant, who knows that the antidote to this disappointment is readily at hand. \"Roman had wanted to come to the last games. He knows everything about this club. We are always happy to see him.\" If Grant can plot a path past United in the Champions League final in Russia, the country of Abramovich's birth, then he will fulfil his employer's ultimate football fantasy. Chelsea knew that a huge helping hand was required from Wigan Athletic against United at the JJB Stadium and Grant had also stressed that overhauling everybody in the league, having succeeded Jose Mourinho five points off the pace, was little more than a pipe dream. In short, nobody should have raised their hopes too high yesterday. The rumours of Wigan goals that spread wildly from the Shed End could not will the desired miracle. Yet the Champions League is a different matter. \"It has been our target to get to the Champions League final but, now we are there, we want to win it,\" said Grant. \"The league was never for one minute in our hands. The players have given everything and in the last months we have played good football. But we have dreamed about the Champions League final and it's a game we want to win.\" The captain, John Terry, added: \"We have lost the league but we still have the biggest trophy of them all. Hopefully we can go to Moscow and bring it home for the Chelsea fans. It's easy for me now to say that's the medal that I want but it is the one that is missing from my list.\" Terry noted that late equalisers conceded had undermined Chelsea's title challenge and, although Matthew Taylor plundered one here for Bolton, the ones that truly hurt Chelsea in recent months were scored by Tottenham's Robbie Keane and Wigan's Emile Heskey. Nevertheless there was polite applause for Grant when he was introduced before the post-match lap of the pitch and home supporters reached out to shake his hand. \"When I see the fans at the end, it made me proud about them and not just the players,\" said Grant, who has still to hear them sing his name. \"The fans said many things which were very nice. We need to be very proud. It hasn't been easy for us this season. In December and January we were without a lot of big players.\" Bruce Buck, the club's chairman, said: \"When Jose Mourinho left and Avram took over we never would have imagined that we would be where we are now. We owe thanks to our entire management and coaching staff, playing staff and backroom staff for what we have achieved.\" Chesea are in talks to sign the Porto right-back Jose Bosingwa, but they are unwilling to pay more than \u00a312m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
