I'm sure there are those who would love to escape from F1 forever. I know I have felt that way on a few occasions! But because it is a global sport with 350 million viewers for 20 of the 52 weekends of the year, it is difficult to ignore. This is especially so when it becomes involved in moral issues that affect us all, such as a death of one of the participants or spectators, deliberate cheating, consuming the earth's resources at a prodigious rate, promoting smoking or banking, spending taxpayers' money, instructing a driver to crash, or being apparently deaf, blind and dumb to human rights abuses. Formula One provides ample ammunition to be labelled \"the bad boy\" of world sport. But no one in the sport is pretending that F1 is the moral standard bearer for mankind. In fact, it caters for the little hedonist in all of us. It blows $1.4bn (\u00a3870m) every year on making a spectacular show. Some like it; some don't. That's freedom for you. On balance, most people let it get on with things and ignore its eccentricities. Every now and then, however, the sport is hauled up by public opinion and put on trial. One thinks of the Le Mans disaster in 1955 in which there were more than 80 deaths, resulting in a ban on motor sport in Switzerland that remains to this day, or the Ratzenberger and Senna tragedies of 1994, or the \"cash for ash\" scandal where donations were made relating to the use of tobacco sponsorship. I'm sure there are more. Formula One does not, cannot, and has never existed in total isolation from the general concerns of humanity. In this sense, the sport is always on the edge of politics. The moment something becomes an issue for all of us, it is a political issue. So the question is this; is the Bahrain Grand Prix now an issue for all of us? Or is it more accurate to ask; are Bahraini politics an issue for all of us? The critical question for F1 is whether it has made the right decision to insist on returning to Bahrain in these times. There are three main considerations for the FIA to make; security, politicisation, and the reputation of its blue riband event, F1. On security, they insist that it is satisfactory, having consulted the people responsible and after taking advice at the highest level. But they do not deny that there is a risk. On whether the FIA event is being conscripted into a political battle to support one side over the other, it is not clear. Many say that this is how it looks. The event is subtitled as UniF1ing Bahrain, so strictly speaking it is trying to appear to be good for the whole nation of Bahrain. The trouble is there are many Bahrainis who disagree about what is good for Bahrain, hence their calls for democracy. Article 1 of the FIA statutes says: \"The FIA shall refrain from manifesting racial, political or religious discrimination in the course of its activities and from taking any action in this respect.\" So far it has not manifested anything other than a desire for the race to take place. However, could holding a race that is becoming a divisive issue for a country, if not for the sport also, constitute \"taking action in this respect\"? A problem in the lead-up to this event was the apparent collusion of Formula One with the promoters in promulgating the view that Bahrain only had a small issue with a few unruly youths. This I regarded as a very clear case of understatement. It was the view of Bahrain that Bahrain would like the world to buy. And it was going to use F1 to help it. This was the point at which I expressed my concerns about this situation. For me, the FIA was dangerously close to appearing totally naive, misinformed or, worse, taking the side that would like to underplay the humanitarian, social and security situation in Bahrain. Sure enough, the international community has had quite a lot to say about what is going on in Bahrain since. This was so inevitable that I am still trying to understand why the FIA did not take the initiative by making at least some comment that indicated it understood the difficulty of the situation. Jean Todt, the president of the FIA, has been consistent in taking the stance of not saying anything that could be construed as political. So he has said next to nothing. This I find baffling. Surely it is possible to condemn acts of inhumanity without taking a side? The Khalifas asked for the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) themselves. Is it political to avoid religious, political and racial discrimination? Surely these are universal human values? Cherif Bassiouni, the chairman of the BICI, managed to do the report and advocate the GP went ahead for the overarching good of the people. He wrote to Todt in February saying: \"Aside from the economic, publicity and public relations advantages that the grand prix brings to Bahrain, it is, on this one-year anniversary of the February-March events of last year, an important point of departure for the people of Bahrain to forge ahead in their national efforts towards reconciliation.\" I'm sure it would have been possible for the FIA to find the words to raise the sport up to the higher ethical plateau described by Nelson Mandela who said: \"Sport can create hope where once there was only despair.\" Instead, with nothing said, what we have are a political issue, a security issue and an issue over the sport's reputation. Could this situation have been avoided? Possibly not. Could it have been ameliorated? I believe so. The recent crisis for Formula One has flushed out most of the arguments and counter arguments on the Bahrain issues, so that is at least one benefit of holding the GP. But also, it has exposed the peculiar political environment within F1. At the centre is this extraordinary man, Bernie Ecclestone, who few dare to publicly disagree with. Perhaps we should, instead of just muttering under our breath, scared of losing our passes. But the problem is also, quite often, he is absolutely right, despite his pithy way of communicating. Take this quote: \"Do you think that if we cancel the Formula One that all the problems will just disappear?\" The answer to that is clearly: \"No. They wouldn't.\" They would just be starting. Frank Gardner, security correspondent for the BBC, has said some in Bahrain feel that \"if the grand prix were to be called off then the Sunni community would be so enraged it would be harder than ever to bridge the gap between government and opposition.\" I think that rather confirms the view of Bahrain as more than a little tense and that the issue is not so simple as it looks. These are the kind of considerations that need to be factored in to the decision making and they are clearly not F1's area of expertise. F1 has to take advice from those who are better qualified, but they must also be independent and have no conflict of interests. More importantly the FIA has to keep F1 and its personnel safe from the world's tricky little traps, one of which is political, but the other is ethical. There is nothing in the FIA statutes that says the body cannot provide ethical guidelines. What is the overriding objective of this \"sport\"? Is it to unite different political factions, or to display the potential of mankind and to inspire the young to take up a challenge from which they will learn about themselves and the world? Does F1 not show that humans are capable of extraordinary ingenuity and cunning, without resorting to disrespect for the rules of the game? Does it not show that some things are more valuable than money? We can always hope. I know that the F1 community does care about the people of Bahrain. I also know those people love Silverstone. It is the sort of social-sporting occasion that nations want when they buy F1. They want what we already have, and one thing we already have is a hard-won freedom of expression. Our sport grew from the ground up. It is uncertain if it can be introduced from the top down. Unfortunately, the hatred that is felt by the more extreme protesters for the Bahrain rulers will inevitably be transferred to F1. Is their cause just or reasonable? I don't know. But without F1, perhaps their cause would have had less of a hearing. I supported Todt's decision to go because I felt we should all go with our heads held up, knowing why we are there and what is expected of us. To prevaricate more would have been unprofessional. To go divided would be worse for F1. So let's get on with bringing our own unique brand of \"goodwill to mankind\" and count ourselves lucky to be free to say what we think. But a bit more sensitivity would not go amiss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
