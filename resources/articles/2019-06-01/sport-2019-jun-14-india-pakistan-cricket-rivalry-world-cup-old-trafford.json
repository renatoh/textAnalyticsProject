But when India and Pakistan face off in Manchester on Sunday the sporting contest will be magnified and warped by so much else: the 70-plus years of shared history and antipathy between the two countries, the recent political tensions in Kashmir, and the stultifying pressure that comes when several hundred million eyeballs are watching on. Few sporting contests carry as much baggage \u2013 or interest. Organisers are hoping that close to a billion people will be watching, with a Cricket World Cup source telling the Guardian that it will have \u201cthe biggest reach of any cricket match in history when you take into account people viewing it on digital\u201d. Those lucky enough to be at Old Trafford have the sporting equivalent of one of Willy Wonka\u2019s golden tickets \u2013 given that 800,000 fans applied for tickets for the 26,000 capacity ground. Munir Khan, a 29-year-old sports teacher from Chorlton, says he could not believe his luck when his application was successful. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be electric,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of noise, and even more tension.\u201d Organisers expect Indian fans to make up 65% of the crowd, with Pakistan supporters another 20% and neutrals the rest. Significant extra security will also be on hand. However Khan does not expect any trouble. \u201cI was there the last time the two countries played in the Champions Trophy in 2017 and the atmosphere was fine,\u201d he says. \u201cAt one point there was even a dance competition between India and Pakistan fans. Of course the political situation isn\u2019t great, but cricket brings everyone together.\u201d That maybe overly optimistic. When Pakistan lost to India at the 1996 World Cup, for instance, the house of their captain Wasim Akram was stoned by angry fans. And some supporters have always \u2013 to bastardise Clausewitz\u2019s famous aphorism \u2013 regarded the match as a continuation of war by other means. Sunday\u2019s game also comes amid a backdrop of tensions between the two countries following the death of 42 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Muhammad in February. As the two countries went to the brink of conflict, the Indian cricket board called for Pakistan to be expelled from the World Cup \u2013 while India\u2019s players also caused controversy in March when they wore army camouflage caps against Australia in support of their troops. In the past month, meanwhile, TV adverts from each country have poked fun at the other. Star TV has featured an Indian supporter calling himself Pakistan\u2019s abbu (father), referring to India\u2019s dominance over their rivals. The Pakistan mobile company Jazz retaliated by releasing an advert that parodies an Indian airman who was captured by the Pakistani military in February. A rare voice of sense came from the Indian tennis player Sania Mirza, who is married to former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik. She tweeted complaining about the \u201ccringeworthy\u201d ads before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s only cricket for God sake, and if you think it\u2019s any more than that then get a grip or get a life.\u201d So how did we get here? According to the Indian historian Kausik Bandyopadhyay, the rivalry provides a \u201cstriking case study to see how a political conflict between two states has saturated the mass psyche to such an extent, that political hostilities are not only played on the Line of Control [in Kashmir] but also on the cricket field. \u201cFor the millions of India and Pakistan, cricket has become the ultimate test of patriotic zeal and loyalty. On and off the pitches, cricket fans vent their passions against the enemy country \u2013 the \u2018other\u2019 \u2013 in forms that range from the funny to the grotesque.\u201d The rarity of the occasion only magnifies the hype and importance of every match \u2013 the last time India and Pakistan played a Test series was back in 2008. However Sharda Ugra, an Indian journalist who is a senior editor at ESPN Cricinfo, says the animosity has not filtered down to the players. \u201cThe actual relations between the Indian and Pakistani players is fairly cordial,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have become much more careful about how they behave on the field because of all the other things that come with it. Politicians in both countries use cricket for as a currency to stir animosities and hatred. But I do feel the players have an empathy for each other for being in this kind of soup.\u201d That does not mean both sides will not be desperate to win, of course, with Pakistan needing a victory to keep their tournament hopes alive and India not wanting to lose their perfect record of six World Cup victories out of six against their bitterest rivals. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the first Indian team to lose against Pakistan at the World Cup,\u201d says Ugra. \u201cEveryone will be watching. And I promise you, everyone will remember.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
