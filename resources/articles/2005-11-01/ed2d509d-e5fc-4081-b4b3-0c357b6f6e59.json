Asked at a further education conference whether she thought ID cards would make the country safer, Dame Stella Rimington replied: \"No is the very simple answer, although ID cards have possibly some purpose. \"But I don't think anybody in the intelligence services - not in my former service - will be pressing for ID cards.\" Her own opinion was that ID cards would be of use \"but only if they can be made unforgeable\". She added: \"If we had ID cards at great expense and people can go into back rooms and forge them they will not make us any safer.\" Tony Blair has long argued that ID cards would help in the fight against crime, benefit fraud, illegal immigration and terrorism, and he is supported by public opinion polls backing the idea. Amidst concern amongst MPs about the cost to the general public the government agreed before the general election to cap the amount to be paid by individuals. The last official costing for the scheme was \u00a35.8bn. The unit cost of a combined 10-year ID card and passport when it is phased in from 2008 was \u00a393. A stand-alone biometric ID card aimed at the low-paid and pensioners would cost \u00a330. But a study by the London School of Economics earlier this year disputed the figures and claimed that a total cost of \u00a319.2bn, and individual cards costing \u00a3230, would be nearer the mark. Former home secretary Lord Waddington yesterday described as \"completely crackers\" the suggestion that the public would be prepared to pay over \u00a3200 for a card. Peers from across the House of Lords attacked both the cost and effectiveness of the scheme. Labour's Lord Gould astonished many peers by claiming: \"The public want ID cards and are prepared to pay for them.\" Dame Stella was answering questions from college principals following a speech on leadership that she delivered to the Association of Colleges' annual conference in Birmingham. She had sought to reassure one principal, worried that the intelligence services would treat all foreigners - particularly Muslims - among his student body as potential terrorists, that there would be no question of blanket treatment of ethnic minority groups. For one thing, she said, there simply were not enough resources to take such an approach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
