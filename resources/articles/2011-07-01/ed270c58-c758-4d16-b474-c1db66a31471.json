The response of the butterflies was extraordinary and seemed all the more remarkable in view of the impact of these conditions upon ourselves. While we tend to wilt and become shade-seeking, they seemed super-charged with solar energy. If you followed any individual butterfly along its meandering course it slowed, dallied and looped around every blossom and nectar source in sight, and yet never once landed; in truth, they kept flying for so long it was hard to believe that the microgram of wing muscle on these insects could sustain such marathon efforts. When the creature you are pursuing from one end of a sun-baked ride to the other promises to be a species you've never seen before, the chase is all the more maddening. Our quarry was a fiery orange and black creature far bigger than any of the common species \u2013 the red admirals, large whites and meadow browns \u2013 we'd been watching all day. We knew it was one of the group called the fritillaries and, since all of them have been extinct in Suffolk for decades, we knew that our excitement was at least well founded. Finally this tiny devotee of the July sun deigned to land, and down came the camera shutter on the black scent lines incising its fierce orange upper-wings and on the muted green under-wings crisscrossed by broken patterns of white. It was a silver-washed fritillary, the largest and most impressive of all the British fritillaries and one that has bucked the dismal trend and expanded its range after years of contraction. The individual, the first ever recorded at Cosford, is a small measure of hope for this glorious insect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
