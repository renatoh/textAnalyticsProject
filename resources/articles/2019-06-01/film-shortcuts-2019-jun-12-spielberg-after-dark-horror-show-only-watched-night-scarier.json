Age: Coming soon. Appearance: Can\u2019t tell you \u2019til dusk. How come? The clue is in the title. It\u2019s Steven Spielberg \u2026 after dark. Is this a film? No, it\u2019s Spielberg\u2019s new TV series. A TV series you can only watch \u2026 after dark. But I don\u2019t want to watch it after dark. I want to watch it on the train. Tough. I don\u2019t understand. Spielberg After Dark is a new horror series, headlining a new mobile-only streaming platform called Quibi. Episodes can only be unlocked once your phone has registered that the sun has set. Why? Because only by watching Spielberg After Dark after dark will you experience the full effect of the show. Right, now I get it. A horror series that you can only watch in total darkness. Well, not total darkness, because electric lights exist now, remember. So it is a horror series that you can watch in the brightest surroundings imaginable? Yes, but only if the sun has set outside. I still don\u2019t see the point. I don\u2019t expect you to. This is cutting edge. Spielberg After Dark has untapped a brand-new way of watching TV. This might only be the start. How so? Well, if the technology exists to prevent you from watching something until a certain time of day, think of the potential. Maybe the next big show after Spielberg After Dark will be Spielberg First Thing in the Morning. Or Spielberg on a Thursday Lunchtime. Why not go even further? Why not have a show that can\u2019t be watched until you\u2019re at a specific location? Spielberg in Gloucestershire, maybe. Or a show that can\u2019t be watched until your phone is upside down! That\u2019s it, now you\u2019re thinking like a tech innovator. Or a show that can\u2019t be watched until you\u2019re driving at 80mph! Well, no, that\u2019s a terrible idea. That\u2019s the most dangerous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. But what if it was called Spielberg Tries to Crash Your Car? Now that\u2019s more like it. I think we might have discovered a gamechanger here. Great! So will you be watching Spielberg After Dark? Are you kidding? Absolutely not. A show that can only be watched at a specific time of day? What an absolute pain in the bum. Do say: \u201cThe future of TV is shows that you can only watch at a certain time.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWhich is actually also the past of TV, come to think of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
