At least three birds were found on the ground this week and were brought to Gibsons Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, according to the Coast Reporter. Irene Davy from the centre said she knows of at least three or four more that may also be brought in for care. Tests showed that there was nothing wrong internally with the birds. \u201cThese are all young birds and we figure what\u2019s happening is it\u2019s probably their first flight, first migration flight, so they\u2019re just exhausted,\u201d Davy told the Guardian. They aren\u2019t falling out of the sky, but just don\u2019t have the energy to get back up. \u201cIn the scheme of things \u2026 the number that we\u2019re finding [on the ground] is not hundreds and hundreds of birds,\u201d she said. Davy told the Coast Reporter that it can be hard for the birds to find food. According to Audubon, snow geese mainly consume plant material, like seeds, leaves and roots. If a snow goose is found alone, it\u2019s usually a sign that something is wrong, Davy said. Another sign is if the bird doesn\u2019t try to fly away when approached by a human. After eating and getting a few weeks of rest and relaxation, the birds will be transported to the George C Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary in Delta, where tens of thousands of other snow geese stay in the winter. To release the snow geese back into the wild, Davy said she will bring the bird to the sanctuary where it will be released into a field with thousands of others. Within a few minutes, the bird will mingle with the other geese. Davy\u2019s only worry was that they may not find their parents again. Snow geese migrate about a few thousand miles to reach the sanctuary, the Coast Reporter wrote. They travel south for the winter in a U-formation or as a \u201csnowstorm\u201d of birds, honking loudly as they go, according to National Geographic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
