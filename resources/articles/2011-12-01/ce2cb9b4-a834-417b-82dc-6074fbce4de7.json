The Republican presidential hopeful said the meeting at their home in Sandy Springs, on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia \u2013 his first face to face with his wife since she learned the news \u2013 will be decisive in whether he remains in the race. \"My wife did not know about it, and that was the revelation,\" he said. \"My wife found out about it when she went public with it. \"My wife now knows. My wife and I have talked about it and I have explained it to her. My wife understands that I'm a soft-hearted giving person.\" He added that Gloria was comfortable with his explanation. Although he and his wife have spoken on the phone this week about the alleged affair, he has said he wanted to discuss it with her face to face before making about a decision about remaining in the race. He would make his decision based on whether he felt it was having an emotional impact on his wife. The former pizza mogul has shifted back and forward this week, at times bullish, insisting he will not be pushed out of the race, at other times dejected. In an interview with the Union Leader, a conservative paper in New Hampshire, he said pulling out of the contest was a possibility. \"Yes, getting out is an option,\" he said. There are less than five weeks left until the first of the Repubublican caucuses to choose a presidential candidate, Iowa on 3 January. Cain has taken a battering over the last few weeks, with his poll figures falling sharply after women came forward with a series of sexual harassment claims, which he has denied. Another woman, Ginger White, claimed in two television interviews in Atlanta on Monday that she had had an affair with Cain dating back to a meeting in a hotel in Kentucky in the mid-1990s. He had ended the affair only earlier this year when he began his run for the presidency, she said. Cain has admitted knowing White but described her as a friend and insisted there had been no sexual relations. In the Union Leader interview, he said his wife \"did not know that we were friends until she (White) came out with this story\". Cain's wife made two television appearances to support him over the sex harassment allegations, saying she did not recognise her husband from the way he had been potrayed by the women. But she has said nothing since the emergence of White. Cain told the Union Leader he had received 70 text messages from White between October 22 and November 18 asking for financial help. He was her only friend in a position to help, he said. \"She was out of work and had trouble paying her bills and I had known her as a friend. She wasn't the only friend who I had helped in these tough economic times, and so her messages to me were relating to 'need money for rent' or whatever the case may be. I don't remember all the specifics,\" Cain said. \"I'm a soft-hearted person when it comes to that stuff. I have helped members of my church. I have helped members of my family.\" He said that White had not been trying to blackmail him by threatening to go public. He did not know why she had come out with it now. \"But I have very strong speculation that someone offered her a lot of money,\" he said. \"I was helping her with month-to-month bills and expenses and somebody \u2013 this is speculation only \u2013 offered her a lot of money. And one of my objectives is to clear my name and my reputation.\" The interview with the Union Leader was held on Thursday after being cancelled last month by Cain. He postponed the interview after he was caught on video struggling to answer a question about Barack Obama's Libya policy while speaking to a Wisconsin paper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
