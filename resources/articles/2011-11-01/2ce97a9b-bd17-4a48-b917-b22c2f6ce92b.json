Asked to speak about football, particularly Spanish football, the Wigan Athletic manager is not only articulate and informative but positively eager to explain what England will be up against at Wembley next Saturday. \"The first time teams from England come up against a side that controls possession so well it can be a bit of a shock,\" Mart\u00ednez says. \"Fortunately the Premier League has changed in recent years. The top clubs at least can now play possession football as well.\" Or at least the foreign players at the top clubs can. Manchester United, to take an obvious example, have struggled as a unit against the excellence of Barcelona's passing in recent seasons, while England have been put in the shade by the technical quality of Germany, never mind the reigning world and European champions. And Fabio Capello has already been deprived of the services of Wayne Rooney, Jack Wilshere and Tom Cleverley for Spain's visit, while Vicente del Bosque's biggest problem is which talented player to leave out to accommodate the newly irresistible David Silva. \"That's the biggest difference between England and Spain,\" Mart\u00ednez says. \"I had Cleverley here last season and he is a fantastic player, he has everything. He and Wilshere can be just as good as Xavi or Andr\u00e9s Iniesta for Spain, but there are only two of them. You need about 50 more, because that is the number of quality players Spain are currently producing. \"They all know each other, they are all friends with each other, and they are all comfortable with the same style of play. I think we can expect Spain to carry on playing in the same way for the next 10 years. There is not even a divide between Read Madrid and Barcelona players any more, because they all grew up together.\" It was not always this way, of course. Mart\u00ednez can remember Spain's old reputation as tournament chokers, just as he can remember (he came to England in 1995) the days when even a player as talented as Silva would have been rejected here on the grounds of height and weight. \"What Spain did was to develop a youth programme that has been running for the last 12 years, and that is the system that has produced Xavi, Silva, Iniesta, [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas and [Juan] Mata,\" he says. \"But those are just the famous names. There are plenty more behind them because what they also do in Spain is allow top clubs to run junior or reserve sides in the division below. \"They can never play in the same league, if one gets relegated the other must drop down a division too, but sometimes in cup games you can see that the reserve team is nearly as good as the first team. It is an idea that many in this country find unacceptable, but if producing good players is the aim it is a model that works. The young players get the competitive experience they need at the right age, and that is precisely what is missing in this country. Reserve team football here does not work, it is useless in helping young players to learn the game, and managers are constantly faced with having to guess whether an 18- or 19-year-old will make it or not, when the next four of five years of development are the all\u2011important ones. \"What you really want is to see the kid in meaningful competition for a couple more seasons, and that is what the Spanish system allows. Here, all you can do is send out your player on loan to gain experience, which is better than nothing but does not help the smaller clubs as much as the big ones.\" It may not be all bad news. Mart\u00ednez believes the best way for England to play against Spain's possession game is with energy, and at least we are still in the right half of the season for that. The end of the season, when tournaments take place, is when English energy traditionally runs out. \"Spain can be surprised by quick counterattacks, as Arsenal showed against Barcelona last season,\" Mart\u00ednez says. \"They keep the ball well, but once it is lost they are not always quick to reset themselves. They can be caught in that period of transition, however brief, and transitional play is the trademark of the Premier League.\" Mart\u00ednez manages to make that sound like a compliment, though what he is actually saying is that English ball retention tends to be poor. He knows that from his own club, though despite a run of seven defeats he is not for changing. \"There is a great temptation to lump the ball into the box more when you need results quickly,\" he says. \"You can sense that is what the fans want us to do but I don't think it will help us. Keeping the ball is a better option, and that's what we try to do, though it is not normal to see that from teams in our position.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
