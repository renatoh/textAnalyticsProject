It\u2019s a little disappointing that in the end they just have a bit of a snoop around his flat. A stirring Dante prematurely brings their fun to an end and Carrie suddenly remembers a redhead first-grader of her occasional acquaintance who needs running to school. Her dicey parenting triggers a row with Maggie and Carrie just can\u2019t back down. She walks out of a stable home and once again, it\u2019s Franny who suffers. This is Carrie on tilt \u2013 her judgement flawed, her credibility shaky and her credit maxed out. When she can\u2019t even gain entry to a low-rent motel, she accepts Dante\u2019s kind offer to stay with him. After all, he makes banging pancakes and there\u2019s about a 10% chance he isn\u2019t a Russian spy. Once Team Mathison are left alone, it\u2019s Franny who discovers photos of Dante\u2019s first wife Audrey \u2013 the infamous bipolar ex over whom he drank himself to distraction. A candid chat at Treasury reveals that Audrey is not bipolar and Dante was never an alcoholic. The former Mrs Allen does, however, mention that there was a simmering resentment from Dante about carrying the can for whatever went down in Kabul while a certain blonde Drone Queen got promotion after bombing a wedding party. So that\u2019s Dante\u2019s pique. The man himself does some spying of his own in Carrie\u2019s room round at Maggie\u2019s. He discovers printouts of his LinkedIn profile and is shocked. There\u2019s someone who actually uses LinkedIn? It prompts a frank late-night discussion between the two where they decide that there is nothing quite as alluring as a mortal enemy. It takes a team of armed men to pull them off each other. Seriously, these two. \u201cShe trusted the wrong people, used her considerable energies to help a foreign power undermine our government.\u201d Saul pays a visit to David Wellington to tell him he knows he\u2019s being set up to take the fall for McClendon and that Simone is very likely a Russian agent. He pumps Wellington for every bit of info on Simone he can get. With the presidency at stake, he can\u2019t afford to screw around. His next step is to strong-arm Max into working with his team. Together they unearth Russian oligarchs on the board of Simone\u2019s NGO but that isn\u2019t enough for an intransigent federal judge who stonewalls Saul in his attempt to interrogate Simone. It\u2019s back to square one. Fortunately, Max comes through by cross-referencing Simone\u2019s movements with Dante\u2019s trips overseas. Their paths cross five times, which seems a little too much of a coincidence. If Saul can\u2019t get to Simone then Dante is the next best thing. He swings by his place with a few close Swat-team buddies and is alarmed to find Carrie and Dante in flagrante in the living room with a severely traumatised Franny nearby. It\u2019s at times like these Carrie is relieved she doesn\u2019t have a job to be sacked from. \u201cWill the walls of this White House come tumbling down?\u201d Elizabeth figures that she doesn\u2019t need to comment on the video of Wellington confronting Simone. After all, how bad can it be? While attending the ceremony for the heroes from the convoy bombing at the Virginia war memorial, she receives and reads David\u2019s letter of resignation. She appreciates the grim irony that he falls on his sword just as she takes credit for his masterstroke. A conversation with Saul confirms that Wellington has been played like a harpsichord by the Russians. Nonetheless, she visits him that night to officially refuse his resignation. If this sorry episode has proved nothing else, it\u2019s that David is fully devoted to her and with her enemies gathering she needs someone at her side willing to take a bullet for her. Notes and observations The second personal letter from David to Elizabeth, stressing that Simone meant nothing to him was a strange one. Is David in love with her? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m OK with that. \u201cSince what you\u2019re really asking is whether you\u2019ll sit in this chair anytime soon, the answer is no.\u201d Elizabeth puts her oily vice-president Ralph Marlin firmly in his place. Latisha, Maggie, Quinn and now Dante \u2013 pretty much everyone who meets her gets on better with Franny than Carrie. There\u2019s a welcome return for Hop the stuffed rabbit who survived the siege last year. Indefatigable. Is David crushing on Elizabeth? Will Saul get to Simone before she testifies? Will Franny ever experience responsible parenting? The comments are open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
