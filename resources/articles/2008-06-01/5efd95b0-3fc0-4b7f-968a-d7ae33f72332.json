There are about 50 voluntary after-school clubs in Newham, where I work, so about five years ago we set up the board to share good practice. Most of the providers know each other, but it was funny at the beginning because we had all been in fierce competition. After the first year, we relaxed, and now the competition raises standards across the borough because you want to be one step ahead. The clubs are a place where children can be whatever they want to be. Of course we have boundaries, but they can play with worms and dirt and it's play, not \"making a mess\". They are learning through play and experimenting. Recently, a little boy had a long dress on, and Dad turned round and said: \"You'll make him into a poof.\" But I said: \"Who are you to say who he is?\" In fact, the little boy said: \"I'm Zorro!\" I want children to be able to play on the street again. My vision is that local communities sign up for a safe-play scheme, and display a sticker in the window. People would have to be checked and have a day's training with the police, but if every house in the street had a sticker, those children would be safe and the community could become cohesive. Because if you know a child is Sean or Paul they are no longer a yob - and Mrs Dobbs behind the curtain stops being the old moaner. I'd like to link schools and play-care providers. Some heads embrace the knowledge we have about families, and we are invited to meetings along with the parents and children. Last summer, I offered teachers paid work for a week - they saw a different side to the children they teach, and the children saw the teachers differently too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
