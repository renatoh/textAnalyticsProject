The Sheffield United manager was more concerned with Nigel Worthington's initial refusal to shake his hand at the final whistle than another defeat caused by his side's recurring defensive deficiencies. \"I've lost a game I thought we should have won and I'm disappointed but to put my hand out, wait five seconds and two of their staff go the other way?\" said Warnock, whose dignified response was to flick two fingers. \"I think it's a disgrace. It's a total lack of respect. I demand the respect of benches.\" Worthington wore a tired expression when he explained that \"nothing ever changes\" with Warnock. The ill feeling stems from Norwich's exuberant celebrations after their win at Bramall Lane on Boxing Day. \"They were a little bit arrogant there, weren't they?\" Warnock noted. Warnock is short on friends in football but the ones he has are letting him down. His side deservedly went ahead when Chris Armstrong drilled past Robert Green but their afternoon's fun ended there. Later in the first half Leon McKenzie and Robert Earnshaw were both granted the freedom of the six-yard box to earn Norwich the points. \"Two silly mistakes and we've ended up losing,\" said Warnock, who did not mention David Unsworth and Craig Short by name despite lapses by his two most experienced players in failing to mark Norwich's forward pair. \"It was poor defending and we were very disappointed in the two goals. There were pluses but they don't make up for the two elementary errors that have given the goals away. I don't think we did much else wrong at the back but it's cost us.\" Of the two teams, Norwich looked like the promotion candidates. Worthington's side, revitalised by Earnshaw's signing and McKenzie's return, have probably left it too late for the play-offs but the foundations are in place for next season, should the manager be retained. Delia Smith may be considering replacing her Carrow Road culinary team after a recent health and safety inspection discovered dirty appliances in the stadium's kitchens but the manager's job is safe for now after calls for his sacking earlier this season. Warnock's position is as strong as ever but he appears ignorant of his side's predicament. They are on the verge of slipping out of the top two, where they have been for all but one week of the season. Given Watford and Leeds play their games in hand tonight and tomorrow respectively, it is possible United will sink into the play-off positions on Saturday. \"We're making it difficult for ourselves but we've not played too poorly in this run,\" said Warnock. \"You ask Wolves, Southampton and Leicester and all the other big sides: we've done quite well this year. I think they might swap places with us. If you look at the pluses, you wouldn't want to play us in the next seven games. We won't win them all but let's get some points on the board.\" Points are what the Blades desperately need. Reaching 87 points, the average finishing total of the second-placed side in the past 10 years, seems beyond them. They have earned only six from the past eight games and will take little comfort from the experiences of Norwich's Carl Robinson. \"Sheffield United have got the edge at the moment but I wouldn't like to put my mortgage on who would go up,\" said the midfielder. \"When I was with Wolves we were 10 points clear of West Brom. They had a few games in hand and eventually caught us. It's not a nice feeling when you're up there to be shot down.\" By repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot, Warnock's men have become their own worst enemy.
