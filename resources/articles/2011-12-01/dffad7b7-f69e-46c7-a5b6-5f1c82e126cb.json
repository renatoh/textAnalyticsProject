I've known Davies for more than 35 years and I'm aware just how much he loves a good argument. Indeed, he not only doesn't shy away from debate, he seeks it out. Despite the criticism he was bound to face over his original Milly Dowler story (of which, more later), I couldn't imagine Caseby besting him. So why the stipulation to Newsnight's producers that he wouldn't appear with Caseby, which resulted in a predictably taunting Sun article, Guardian dodges TV clash with the Sun? He didn't dodge the argument anyway because Jules Stenson, former News of the World features editor, put the News International line in much the way Caseby would have done. So I remained baffled until I read the latest issue of Private Eye, which surely provides the answer to Davies's reluctance to sit down in public with Caseby. According to the Eye report, Caseby sent Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger a toilet roll with a note saying: \"I hear Marina Hyde's turd landed on your desk. Well you can use this to wipe her arse.\" The reference to Hyde related to an article she wrote in late November in which she wrongly accused the Sun of doorstepping a member of the Leveson inquiry team. The story was swiftly amended and the paper immediately apologised (see footnote). But Caseby's squalid, scatological note plumbs new depths. It was a wholly disproportionate and disgusting response by a senior editorial executive to a single error. If people were to adopt a similar tactic when complaining about the Sun's catalogue of factual errors on any given week its office would be overflowing with toilet rolls. Doubtless, there are staff in Wapping who think Caseby was justified because they imagine that he was also correct in stating that the Guardian is responsible for the closure of the News of the World. That was the burden of Caseby's statement to a House of Lords committee when he accused the Guardian of \"sexing up\" its stories about the hacking scandal. This is the absurd view of Caseby, Stenson, Stephen Glover, News International, the Daily Mail and, sadly, the Independent. They argue that Davies's 4 July landmark story about the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone now lacks credibility because it stated that voicemails had been deleted by the News of the World. In their view, if that revelation had not been published, then the NoW would not have been closed down and a whole raft of subsequent dramas - News Int resignations, Met police resignations, the setting up of the Leveson inquiry - would not have occurred. I just cannot see how this argument stands up. The very fact - unequivocal fact - that Milly's phone was hacked was, in itself, a scandalous act. Similarly, the fact - the unequivocal fact - that scores more people had been hacked, including 7/7 victims - was enough to warrant all that happened after the first Davies story. Then add on the revelations of widespread tabloid misbehaviour from the witnesses to the Leveson inquiry. All of this is justification for what Davies first wrote and what the Guardian published. I didn't write this before because I know people will see it as special pleading. I am a friend of Davies and I work for the Guardian. I am parti pris. I had therefore planned not to comment. But the Caseby note to Rusbridger was too much. It shows the true face of News International. In spite of all that has happened, it remains in denial. Worse, that denial is accompanied by a vicious streak. Single errors by Davies and Hyde amid a host of truths do not invalidate the Guardian's terrific overall work. I cannot believe, in all conscience, that editors and journalists across Britain do not agree. \u2022 This blog was amended on 10 December 2012. The original blog by Roy Greenslade referred to a story by Marina Hyde published on 23 November 2011 about the Leveson inquiry, which incorrectly stated that the Sun had sent a reporter to the home of a lawyer to the inquiry. While Greenslade linked to the original Hyde story online it was an amended version in which the references to the lawyer being doorstepped have been deleted. To clarify, here are the deleted paragraphs: \"Meanwhile, if you want to know how deeply the self-reproach is running over at News International, do be advised that the Sun yesterday sent a reporter to doorstep the so-called \"#womanontheleft\". Carine Patry Hoskins is the junior counsel to the inquiry who trended worldwide on Twitter on Monday after being picked up by the TV cameras listening to Hugh Grant's testimony (how dare counsel pay attention?). To the paper, the doorstep is routine; others might deem it the equivalent of blowing a giant raspberry at Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry, or perhaps casually defecating on his lordship's desk while doing a thumbs-up sign. Tomato, Tomahto.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
