She also said the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, lied when he said her husband had been \u201cambiguous\u201d about the elevator incident, which occurred at a casino in Atlantic City. Rice\u2019s suspension, which was handed out in September after he had been given an initial and much-criticised two-game ban, was overturned on appeal on Friday. A former federal judge accepted the player\u2019s contention that he had been wrongfully punished twice, having told the truth about the event throughout the NFL\u2019s disciplinary protest. Without a team after the Ravens released him, he is now free to play in the NFL this season. \u201cI know for a fact that Ray told the honest truth that he\u2019s been telling from February,\u201d Rice said in an interview with the Today Show\u2019s Matt Lauer broadcast on Monday. Rice has repeatedly defended her husband since a video released in February showed her then fiance dragging her from the elevator. In September, TMZ released a video of him punching her inside the elevator. After the release of the second video enflamed debate over how the NFL treated cases of domestic abuse involving its players, Goodell increased Rice\u2019s punishment. Goodell has come under pressure over whether the league knew of and viewed the full video of the incident before it handed Rice his initial two-game ban. The commissioner has said he had not seen the full tape. Speaking to NBC, Janay Rice said she thought the NFL was trying to defend itself from criticism by changing her husband\u2019s punishment. \u201cI think they did what they had to do for themselves,\u201d she said. Rice said her husband had never hit her before the elevator incident, which occurred a month before they married, and has not abused her since. \u201cHe knows what he would have to deal with, you know, if this was something,\u201d Rice said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me \u2013 and God forbid, in front of my child, just like, let it happen? There\u2019s no way.\u201d She also discussed the chances that an NFL team would be willing to sign her husband. Such a deal would need a team \u201cto look past this situation, which I know is going to be hard\u201d, she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day he\u2019s a football player and that\u2019s what they should be really focused on because he\u2019s proven himself as a football player for seven years. There\u2019s never been a question on what he can do on the field.\u201d Rice, 27, is a three-time Pro Bowl selection. He was part of the Baltimore team which won Super Bowl XLVII. He was charged with felony aggravated assault, before being accepted into a pretrial intervention program that could result in the charge being expunged from his record. Last week, ESPN released Janay Rice\u2019s account of the night of the elevator incident and its aftermath, based on an interview with reporter Jemele Hill. \u201cI still find it hard to accept being called a \u2018victim\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI know there are so many different opinions out there about me \u2013 that I\u2019m weak, that I\u2019m making excuses and covering up abuse \u2013 and that some people question my motives for staying with Ray. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m a strong woman and I come from a strong family. Never in my life have I seen abuse, nor have I seen any woman in my family physically abused.\u201d The extensively trailed NBC interview, also with Ray Rice, was scheduled to be broadcast on Monday and Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
