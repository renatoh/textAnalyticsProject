In May it was discovered that the daughter of the prime minister, Tony Abbott, had been attending the school on a \u201cchairman\u2019s scholarship,\u201d which she had been offered exclusively. Les Taylor, the chairman of the school\u2019s board of governors, personally recommended Frances for the scholarship and is a Liberal party donor. On Tuesday police issued a court attendance notice to the 20-year-old woman \u201cin relation to the unauthorised access of restricted data,\u201d a NSW Police spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe woman, who was a former employee of a fashion design institute, is now due to appear before Downing centre local court on the 18th of September,\u201d she said. The investigation was sparked by a formal complaint from the Whitehouse institute about the alleged accessing of student records. The institute\u2019s chief executive, Ian Tudor, told Guardian Australia the confidentiality of student records was of \u201cparamount importance to the institute, and given the magnitude of the breach of confidentiality we were obliged to report it to the police\u201d. A failed bill by independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie in 2012 \u201cmight\u201d have given private-sector whistleblowers some support if it had passed, a spokesman for the Australian Lawyer\u2019s Alliance told Guardian Australia, but as legislation currently stands there is little support for non-public-servant whistleblowers. \u201cAustralia has the worst human rights protections for whistleblower protection in the OECD and this case is evidence of that,\u201d said Greg Barnes. While he was not passing judgement on the nature of the charges, he said \u201cif this woman was in the US or Canada for example she would probably be able to avail of herself a freedom of speech defence and certainly some sort of whistleblower protection.\u201d Barnes said it was \u201ccurious\u201d that this case had been acted on \u201cwith alacrity by police\u201d and that the woman was charged with a crime, as there have been \u201cvery few\u201d prosecutions of people for unauthorised access of data. At the time the prime minister was criticised for not declaring the scholarship on his parliamentary register of interests, however his office and the design school maintained the scholarship was granted on merit, and therefore did not need to be declared as a gift. Fellow students of Frances Abbott were angry they had not been told of the scholarship\u2019s existence. She was only the second student to receive the scholarship in the school\u2019s 25-year history. Police declined to give further details on the charge because the matter is before the court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
