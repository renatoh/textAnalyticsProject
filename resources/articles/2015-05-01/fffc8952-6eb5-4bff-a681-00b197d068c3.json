He thinks for a moment. He wants his message to be meaningful. He begins writing, carefully and neatly. The sentiment is absolutely him: \u201cThe most important thing in life is to never GIVE UP.\u201d If anybody at Arsenal embodies that impulse, it is this persistent Frenchman. Ever since he arrived at the club as a 17-year-old on a week\u2019s trial, and felt the inimitable wrath of Jens Lehmann when he did not understand someone behind him yelling: \u201cKeeeeper!\u201d and kicked the ball away before the goalie could grab it, the pathway has been demanding. Coquelin has faced challenges that might have provoked more fragile characters to throw in the towel. He is no giver-upper, however, whatever the circumstances. Five months ago, Coquelin was sitting in the manager\u2019s office at Charlton. He had been given the green light by Arsenal to extend his loan stay there and it was understood a permanent deal away from his parent club was on the cards. Bob Peeters, who had taken him to the Valley, wanted him to play in a deep midfield role and build the side around him. \u201cFive days later I was on the sofa with my wife watching TV and I got a call from Arsenal saying: \u2018You have to come back,\u2019\u201d he says. It was a career-changing call. Coquelin was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s last joker in the pack. Since returning to the Arsenal lineup as an emergency option to cover for a spate of midfield injuries, Coquelin has become the surprise answer to the balance question which had nagged for years. His expert interpretation of the Claude Makelele role has underpinned a progressive 2015 that has the club eyeing second place in the Premier League and the FA Cup final. The way he sees it, it is all about the blend between his interceptions and Santi Cazorla, Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s creations. \u201cIf I can take away 10% of their defensive duties then they can have 10% more to attack and score goals and win us the game and I\u2019m delighted,\u201d he says of the team\u2019s improved equilibrium. \u201cI remember Zidane and a lot of great players saying when you took out Makelele you took out the heart of their team,\u201d Coquelin explains. \u201cI think players who play this position don\u2019t want the spotlight. They like to do their job and then they leave the bling-bling for other players.\u201d Coquelin, Arsenal\u2019s king of counter-bling, has become so important that when he was substituted in the FA Cup semi-final as Wenger searched for a winning goal, the response from the red and white crowd was a sharp intake of panicky breath, as if it all might collapse without the glue they call Le Coq. This status, as a vital player, has been a long time coming. Perhaps he just likes being fashionably late. He only came to football at around 10 years old. Before that his grandmother took him to judo and he was keen on tennis. \u201cI couldn\u2019t serve properly and I remember we had a tournament and at the semi-final this guy beat me. It was the first game I lost and I stopped.\u201d He went off tennis abruptly. A friend told him to come and join his football team, so Coquelin gave it a try, just for fun. In his early teens he progressed to Stade Lavallois, the biggest club in his area of western France, and before long his mother was fielding calls from numerous Ligue 1 clubs. Arsenal\u2019s French scout, their former defender Gilles Grimandi, spotted him playing for France\u2019s Under\u201117s and Coquelin was invited for a week\u2019s trial at London Colney. He remembers the experience with mirth. \u201cI thought I was going to have a nice little week in the reserves,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never trained with the first team in Laval. I saw Gallas, Bac Sagna, Clichy, from the French national team, and I was thinking: \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019\u201d First there was the Lehmann incident \u2013 \u201cHe went absolutely crazy on me! I didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201d Then Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 and Cesc F\u00e0bregas had a fight because one kicked the other. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018Is every training like this? It\u2019s war in here!\u2019\u201d He returned to Laval without great expectations. \u201cI had missed a week of school and everyone was asking how it was at Arsenal. I was in my class and my phone rang and I looked at it. It was some weird number +44. I couldn\u2019t answer the phone so they left a voicemail. It was the boss. In France he used to do the commentating on TV so obviously everyone knows his voice. I was listening: \u2018Hello, Francis, how are you?\u2019\u201d Coquelin passed the phone to his amazed school friends. He was back in a classroom this week, looking around the spacious new facility built by his club to house their far-reaching community work. As well as providing England\u2019s first 4G indoor pitch, there are classrooms to help local primary school children learn languages and guide older teenagers who need tools to help prepare them for getting a job. Within the hub and out in three local boroughs, more than 5,000 Londoners participate in the programmes Arsenal run each week. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive thing,\u201d says Coquelin. \u201cThis kind of stuff can put you on the right track.\u201d He is a big believer in opportunities, considering how his were not the most straightforward. His debut was harrowing \u2013 he was part of the inexperienced group humiliated 8-2 by Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2011, and namechecked by Sir Alex Ferguson as a player out of his depth. Even then he was an emergency measure, rushed back from playing with France\u2019s Under-20 team in Colombia. \u201cThe team was not ready for a game like that,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was basically the reserves playing. To be honest they could shoot from anywhere that game, it was going top corner. It was one of those games you want to forget.\u201d His loans were character building. In particular, a spell with Freiburg last season tested him to the limits. \u201cVery tough,\u201d he says, exhaling. \u201cI didn\u2019t get on with the manager, I was played out of position all season, left wing or right wing.\u201d The manager, Christian Streich, seemed down on him from day one. \u201cI went many times to his office and said: \u2018You know what? I am not asking a lot, I am just asking give me one game in the middle of the park, so you can see what I can do. Then if you are not happy with me, play someone else in that position.\u2019 He never gave me that opportunity.\u201d Coming back from the mid-season break, things got worse. \u201cWe played friendly games and I was always a sub. The last game of the friendlies they were losing 5-0 at half-time against a German second division club. I came on, we scored, and lost 5-1. We had a meeting after, the whole group, and he didn\u2019t say a word about the team who were losing 5-0, it was all about me. I went to see him and asked to go back to Arsenal. He said: \u2018No, we are counting on you.\u2019 Then I played zero games.\u201d Isolated, in a different country, frustrated by a manager who seemed to bait him and not playing, he dealt with the situation with personal resilience. Rather than breaking his spirit, the experience merely strengthened his resolve. \u201cMentally it was tough. Then one day I woke up and realised: \u2018OK, I am not going to play. Now I am training to be ready for next season at Arsenal.\u2019\u201d The maturity and discipline that Wenger wanted came when Coquelin accepted he had to cut out the bling and learn to love simplicity in holding midfield. \u201cWhen you are young, every time you get a minute and he tells you to go and sit you want to show you can do loads of things. Obviously with time you understand what you are good at,\u201d he says. So much of his game is based on shrewd reading of situations. Coquelin is quite small for a dominant defensive midfielder (Nemanja Matic is about six inches taller) but his stocky strength and stamina serves him well. A new contract and some standout moments in his whirlwind past few months symbolise how significant he has become to Arsenal. \u201cIt was nice to go back to Old Trafford,\u201d he grins, having played his part in a victory in the FA Cup. \u201cA big one is probably Man City because people were thinking: \u2018You\u2019re going in with Coquelin in midfield? Against Man City? You\u2019re going to get smashed.\u2019 And we won 2-0.\u201d Since then he has performed with admirable regularity. Arsenal\u2019s recent run makes him feel they are getting close to a serious assault on the Premier League. \u201cAfter what we\u2019ve done in 2015 we will be aiming, next season, to fight for the title. I think there was a point where big players were leaving the club and it didn\u2019t look attractive to the top players. And then I think signing Santi was the first step. I remember his first training session. Everyone knew: this one is from another planet. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t love football, you will love it after looking at him. And Mesut was a turning point. The very top players want to come to Arsenal because they can see the team is strong.\u201d All the stronger for the boy from Laval who never gave up. Francis Coquelin joined Per Mertesacker and guests to celebrate the opening of The Arsenal Hub \u2013 Home of Arsenal in the Community. The Hub will be used by 1,500 Londoners every week for sports, education and social programmes.
