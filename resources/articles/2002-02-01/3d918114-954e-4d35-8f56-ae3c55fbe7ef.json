Working at a speed which defied all the laws normally governing the actions of those who run sporting organisations, the club announced yesterday, not much more than 24 hours after Tuesday's secret dawn raids on five stables, that all the samples taken from 408 horses had tested negative for the banned drug erythropoietin (EPO). As a public relations exercise, executed only a couple of weeks before the Cheltenham Festival, it could hardly have been bettered. For in one fell swoop, or so it believes, the Jockey Club has well and truly squashed all the rumours that have been rife within the jumping world for the past six months - namely that some trainers have been using EPO to make their horses run faster. The horse racing forensic laboratory is to be congratulated. No messing about with A and B samples for it, and therefore no protracted weeks of waiting, as happens where human athletes are involved. As for the use of independent laboratory analysis, as practised by other sports - well, better hold your horses before jumping to any cynical conclusions. The procedure for testing humans is still a contentious issue, with the International Olympic Committee currently upholding the view that it has to be a combined blood and urine test. Not so for horses, presumably. But, anyway, vets remain undecided on whether EPO, which increases the number of red blood cells which carry the oxygen around the body and thereby improves stamina, is of any benefit to horses whatsoever, or whether it may do them essential harm. Of course, the unending quest for success, be it in horse racing or any other sport, will always drive some of those involved to seek unfair and illegal advantages through the use of drugs. Every year millions upon millions of pounds are poured into medical research to prevent or stop illnesses, and it is a strange paradox that the development of new medicines may also end up benefiting those whose sole aim is to cheat on their fellow sporting rivals. This was the case at the recent Winter Olympics when three cross-country skiers, two Russians and a Spaniard, tested positive for the drug darbepoetin, which had been specifically designed to help cure anaemia by increasing the number of red blood cells. For athletes it works in the same way as EPO, increasing stamina for long-distance events...such as tracking across snow on skis. Darbepoetin was so new that it had not even made it on to the banned list for Salt Lake City, but the IOC deemed it was so close to EPO as to come under the catch-all of \"related substances\". But what are we to make of these Olympic busts? Were these Russian and Spanish athletes trying to be a bit too clever, or were they plain stupid? And was it a lasting blow in favour of the drug testers, or does it mean there were several hundred more who simply evaded the IOC's best-laid traps? The simple and honest answer is that nobody can be sure, one way or another. It is a sad but accepted fact that the chemists will inevitably stay one step ahead of the testers. Over the past decade the gap may have closed but it has been an immensely costly process, and there remain sporting organisations that pay lip service to any progress under the guise of extra testing, while never making public what they are actually testing for. Of these, cycling was one of the most notorious, although it was well and truly hoist by its own petard in 1998 with the great EPO scandal. Prior to yesterday's Jockey Club announcement, there appeared to be a general feeling within the sport that the tests would prove negative. There are, undoubtedly, some trainers out there doping horses. If nothing else, the incentive to cheat is so much greater in racing because of the betting. But for the moment at least, any idea that EPO is being used on a widespread scale has been knocked on the head by the Jockey Club, even if the operation appeared just a little too slick and, for all the secrecy, a little too staged. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
