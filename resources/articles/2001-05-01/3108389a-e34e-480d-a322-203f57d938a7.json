The Consumer Association is different from most lobbying organisations in that we are here to represent consumers' interests and don't have large budgets for entertaining in the same way as some of the private lobbying firms. I campaign on food and communication issues and work as part of a team made up of specialist advisers, lawyers and staff from our policy unit. Between us we form, draft and carry out strategies on a variety of issues. At any one time I might be working on BSE, GM crops, food poisoning or consumers' problems with the utility companies. An example of the lobbying work we do would be the work we carried out in the run-up to the formation of the Food Standards Agency. The CA had long campaigned for such an agency to be put in place and once it was announced, the focus of our efforts changed. During the drafting of the White Paper we were in contact with civil servants writing the legislation; once it was published we worked in parliament to produce amendments that we felt were in the public's best interest. Because the present government has such a large majority in the House of Commons we have found it easier to work in the Lords. It's a case of lobbying sympathetic peers, explaining what the impact of the legislation will be if it is unchanged, and persuading them to table amendments. Sometimes it involves stalking the corridors of parliament late at night; mostly it's about knowing the right person to call, and picking up the phone. Now that the election has been called things tend to go a little quiet, but that's no bad thing. We will be getting each party's manifesto and, while the CA is obviously politically neutral, if there were anything that was not in our members' interests we would point that out. The other side of my job is representing the organisation to the media. Part of the campaigning involves writing press releases and being on call to do radio and TV interviews. On Monday I came into work thinking I had a quiet day only to be told there was a car waiting to take me to ITN. I studied public administration at Nottingham and my break was spending a year working as a researcher in the House of Commons library, which gave me my entry into what can sometimes seem a strange world. The thrill of the job is when you are working on a campaign that is getting MPs excited and there is the perceptible feeling that things are really happening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
