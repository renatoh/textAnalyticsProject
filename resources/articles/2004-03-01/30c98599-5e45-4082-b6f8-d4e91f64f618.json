For Steve Gibson, drenched in champagne, coming back down to earth can rarely have been this pleasurable. The 46-year-old will have a pounding hangover today as he cringes through television replays of his madcap celebrations. \"I've often looked at other people getting involved in games like that and thought, 'What a prat,'\" he admitted with a smile. \"Perhaps I enjoyed it a little more than I should have, but I was wrapped up in the occasion. That was a big day for our football club.\" And for Gibson more than most. The chairman was briefly reviled on Teesside as the man who took Boro into administration in 1986 before immediately buying the reborn and reformed club that emerged from the financial wreckage. Since then some \u00a3110m has been poured in to rejuvenate their fortunes, from new players to a new stadium to a new training complex. A first trophy in the club's 128-year history represented a return on that labour of love. \"This is important for the club and for the town,\" he said as the strains of \"There's only one Steve Gibson\" echoed around the emptying arena. \"This hasn't happened overnight; it's been going on for 10 years. If you're Arsenal, Manchester United or even Chelsea, winning a competition like this is not that important, but for us it's massive. \"When I first spoke to Steve McClaren about the job I told him the club needed to change, in many ways, so he would have to be patient with me. But Steve also said the club needed changes on the coaching side and I'd have to be patient with him. Now he's brought a trophy here within three seasons, and that speaks volumes for the guy.\" McClaren has played his part in exorcising the memory of his predecessor Bryan Robson's three fruitless cup final appearances in the late 1990s. Only Juninho and the goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer remain from that frenetic era, with more than 20 other players shipped out by the new manager since he arrived at the Riverside in 2001. The former Derby and Manchester United coach's five-year plan is clearly gathering pace. \"After putting ourselves under so much pressure to succeed, it's a great feeling,\" said McClaren, who experienced success aplenty as Sir Alex Ferguson's No2 at Old Trafford. \"Now we can see how far this club can go. We need to keep progressing, not stand still.\" The Boro manager was still changing from cup final suit to tracksuit when Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Job scored their opening goal. He had reached the dug-out by the time Boudewijn Zenden smudged his penalty beyond Jussi Jaaskelainen, only to be left with frayed nerves by Mark Schwarzer's uncharacteristic error which allowed Kevin Davies to score, then by the frantic finale which might have yielded a penalty after Ugo Ehiogu seemed to handle. \"Cup finals are won by very small margins - referees' decisions, mistakes - and, while not everything went for us today, the majority did,\" he added, and said of his captain: \"Gareth Southgate was magnificent. Given the way we played and the manner in which we set our stall out, we deserved the luck. \"So much has been said about the ambition at this club since I walked through the door, but winning a trophy was always the goal from the moment I first met the chairman. He deserves an awful lot of credit. The fans weren't cheering for the players or the manager at the end, they were cheering for the chairman. That's how much he means to them. There'll be no prouder man than Steve Gibson.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
