A supporters' organisation, formed only six days ago, claimed to have taken control of the troubled club after buying a 78% shareholding for \u00a36,240. Today the Chesterfield Football Supporters' Society will discover the size of the task awaiting it when an independent disciplinary panel reconvenes to discuss whether the club, having been found guilty of financial irregularities, should be expelled. Howard Borrell, spokesman for the Chesterfield Football Supporters' Society, said: \"We have reclaimed the club on behalf of the fans and the town. Now we can begin the process of turning Chesterfield Football Club around.\" It is almost certain the panel will increase Chesterfield's punishment, possibly blocking their promotion or demoting them to the Conference, after the league's board of directors declared last week that the initial recommendation of a nine-point deduction and \u00a320,000 fine was too lenient. If Chesterfield are denied promotion the society plans to appeal. The supporters have bought UK Sports Group Ltd, which held the controlling interest, after a collection and a raffle at an inaugural meeting attended by about 1,000 people last Wednesday. They are taking advice about ways to ease debts believed to total more than \u00a31m. However, Darren Brown, a club director and former chairman, disputes the legality of the sale of the shares and is said to be considering legal action. A winding-up order is due to be served against the club at Leeds crown court on May 10 on behalf of the Inland Rev enue and Glory Years, the club's shirt manufacturers, and the following day Norton Lea, another former chairman, will challenge the supporters' ownership of the 78% shareholding in the high court. Several players have not been paid for up to two months. The goalkeeper Mike Pollitt handed in his notice yesterday and will become a free agent in two weeks. Brown has proposed that the club ground-share at Mansfield Town but the society is opposed to leaving Saltergate. \"We have three aims: the first is Second Division football, the second to make sure that our football is played at Saltergate and not at Mansfield and the third to assess the financial situation and prevent a winding-up notice being served,\" said its chairman Ian Yeowart. The takeover mirrors events earlier this season at Lincoln City. Brian Lomax, chairman of Supporters Direct, which has advised Chesterfield's supporters, said: \"This is the second time this has happened in a short period. It is becoming a mass movement in which the people who morally own football - the fans - are reclaiming the game.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
