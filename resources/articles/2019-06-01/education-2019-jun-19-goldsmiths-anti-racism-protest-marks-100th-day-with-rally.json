Goldsmiths Anti-Racist Action protesters have occupied Deptford town hall on the south London campus since March, demanding a series of measures to tackle racism at the university, including mandatory anti-racism training for all staff. After a month-long stalemate, protesters are due to meet senior university management next week. The occupiers warned, however, that if talks collapse the occupation will continue. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to keep going until our demands met. We\u2019ll occupy that building indefinitely,\u201d said Sherrie Gasana, a 24-year-old master\u2019s student. Fellow protester Fiona Wong said: \u201cIf Goldsmiths hopes that the movement will die down, then they will be sorely disappointed. We are more determined than ever to stay until our demands are met, whether it\u2019s 10, 100, or 1,000 days more.\u201d The protesters are also demanding that Deptford town hall, which was bought by the university in 2000, should be opened up to the local community. They want to see cuts to courses reversed, and scholarships earmarked for Palestinian students, won by a previous student occupation 10 years ago, reinstated. They are also campaigning to bring outsourced security staff back in-house in order to strengthen their workplace rights and ensure they enjoy the same benefits as other employees at the institution. Cleaning services were brought back in-house last month. There was a celebratory mood among students occupying Deptford town hall on Wednesday. The students\u2019 union education officer, Taylor McGraa, 24, said that while the occupation had not affected the university as much as hoped, the community had been changed for the better. \u201cThey know that people are no longer going to be quiet about Goldsmiths\u2019 dirty laundry,\u201d she said. Many contrasted Goldsmiths\u2019 portrayal of itself as a diverse and inclusive institution with the realities of life on campus. Sara, a 21-year-old student at the university, said: \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that they\u2019ll fulfil the demands, especially because this is a so-called liberal and progressive university. If they\u2019re not listening to students of colour, it\u2019s an injustice to this label.\u201d Mona Mounir, the students\u2019 union welfare and liberation officer, said: \u201cGoldsmiths loves to brand itself in a way that isn\u2019t really the reality. Students and staff at Goldsmiths have been experiencing racism over a number of years. \u201cThis occupation started as a consequence of years of students and staff being dismissed, belittled and no adequate action taken. The institution has chosen to not prioritise these issues for a number of years and it was time for this to change.\u201d A university spokesperson said: \u201cWe have committed to taking action to address the protesters\u2019 key demands and have already made progress on steps such as reviewing how reports of racism are handled, recruiting additional student wellbeing staff and planning mandatory race equality training for staff. \u201cAfter declining repeated offers of talks with Goldsmiths management, in the last few days the protesters have agreed to resume discussions about how the college can move this work forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
