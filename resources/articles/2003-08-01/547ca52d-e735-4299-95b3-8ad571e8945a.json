The journalist sent an email to a Liberal Democrat press officer suggesting questions that could be put to Dr Kelly by the foreign affairs select committee. In the email dated July 14, Gillligan described Dr Kelly as \"an extremely interesting witness\". \"Above all he should be asked what kind of threat Iraq was in September 2002 and, if he was able to answer frankly, it should be devastating,\" Gilligan wrote. Gilligan did not admit Dr Kelly was the source of his \"sexed-up\" dossier story broadcast on the Radio 4 Today programme, which started the row between the BBC and the government. The email addressed to the Lib Dems' Greg Simpson was submitted to the Hutton inquiry by David Chidgey MP, a member of the FAC. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: \"We passed on the email to the Hutton inquiry thinking that it could be relevant.\" It is not clear why the document was not submitted by the BBC as part of its evidence to the inquiry. James Dingemans QC said the email had not arrived in time for him to put its contents to Gilligan, who gave evidence last week. Mr Dingemans suggested to the No 10 communications chief, Alastair Campbell, who was up before the inquiry today, that the email showed Gilligan was using the FAC investigation to attack the government. Mr Dingemans asked Mr Campbell whether he thought the government was using the parliamentary inquiry to get at the BBC. \"A game of chicken was being played by two great big institutions with Dr Kelly in the middle,\" Mr Dingemans suggested. Mr Campbell replied: \"I do not accept that. I find that quite an extraordinary email.\" The prime minister's director of communications and strategy also played down the significance of an email highlighted at the inquiry yesterday, in which No 10 press officer Tom Kelly described the row as a \"game of chicken\" between the government and the BBC. \"I don't think it does reflect the mindset really. I think emails that are sent between colleagues who are very close and work very closely can look very different when you're looking at them on a screen in a courtroom,\" Mr Campbell said. \"I think the point he was making was at some point one of us is going to have to back down.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
