Ministers transferred back-office functions \u2013 human resources, payroll and accounts \u2013 to the private sector two-and-a-half years ago in a plan which was supposed to \u201cradically improve efficiency across departments\u201d. At the time, the cabinet minister Francis Maude said: \u201cThere is absolutely no need for departments and arm\u2019s-length bodies to have their own back-office functions, and duplicate efforts, when they can be delivered more efficiently by sharing services and expertise. Plus it will save the taxpayer half a billion pounds a year.\u201d The National Audit Office has examined the \u201cshared services\u201d initiative and found that instead of saving at least \u00a3128m a year, it has saved \u00a390m \u2013 \u00a34m less than it has cost. In a highly critical report, auditors said that delays in its roll-out mean that costs will continue to rise. Confidence in the entire project \u201cis now low\u201d, the NAO found, with further costs also incurred in drawing up contingency measures and dealing with the fact delays have already rendered some elements of the new system out of date. Auditors said the Cabinet Office \u201cdid not act in a timely and effective manner\u201d because it \u201cdid not see this as its role\u201d and had \u201conly recently taken a more active approach to dealing with the issues that have been raised\u201d. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking the Cabinet Office has failed to convince other government departments to adopt a programme that was supposed to deliver significant savings for the taxpayer. \u201cThis comes after repeated warning from the NAO and the public accounts committee that the programme was not working. It\u2019s yet another failure from the prime minister\u2019s own department.\u201d Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \u201cThis is an all-too-familiar story of Tory ministers cutting and privatising, only to find they have wasted money and damaged services. \u201cWe opposed the privatisation of shared services because we did not believe it would deliver the savings that were promised and we have been proved right.\u201d The 2013 civil service reform plan introduced by Maude saw the creation of two shared services centres which would handle human resources, payroll and accounts for up to 14 departments and their arm\u2019s-length bodies. The Cabinet Office signed contracts with two private sector companies \u2013 Arvato UK and Steria \u2013 to operate the centres. Auditors found there were initial weaknesses in the programme and these were exacerbated by the Cabinet Office\u2019s failure to take control of the project. While recent governance and leadership changes had been welcomed by departments and the two private suppliers involved, the NAO warned that \u201cprevious efforts in this area have not produced results\u201d. It said: \u201cThe government has repeatedly failed to learn the lessons from its experiences of shared services.\u201d However, it acknowledged that blame lay also with contractors Steria and Arvato UK. The scale of the problems was underlined when an arm of the Department for Business Innovation and Skills pulled out of its contract arguing it was \u201cno longer viable\u201d. The Cabinet Office has redrawn its projections and is now hoping for major savings. A departmental spokesman said: \u201cAs the report states, the Independent Shared Service Centres have already saved \u00a390m, and are forecast to make a further \u00a3504m in savings for the government and police by 2023/24. \u201cThe report recognises that the Cabinet Office is addressing the challenges involved in managing digital transformation, but we accept that we need to go further, and we will.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
