Long live the king? With Usain Bolt retired, athletics needs a new sprint hero. The brilliant young American Noah Lyles reckons he has the talent and charisma to fill some of the 6ft 5in hole left by the Jamaican. \u201cI want to transcend the sport,\u201d says Lyles, who runs in Britain for the first time at the Birmingham grand prix on Saturday. \u201cTrack and field in America isn\u2019t that big until the Olympics comes around and I want to change that.\u201d Lyles is certainly fast. Not only is he the quickest man over 100m and 200m this year but his personal bests \u2013 9.88sec for 100m and 19.65 for 200m \u2013 are better than Bolt\u2019s at the same stage (21 years and one month). However, he literally dreams of getting a lot quicker. \u201cIn 2016 I had a dream where I raced and the clock flashed 9.41 and I ran up to my mom and said: \u2018Mom, I just ran 9.41,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cAnd she was like: \u2018That\u2019s nice, Noah.\u2019 And then she turned around and said: \u201cWhat did you just say? That\u2019s a world record.\u2019 But I do really think I can run 9.41. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen but I\u2019m going to try my best to do it.\u201d Like Bolt, Lyles is a natural showman. When he raced in Doha in May he wore R2D2 socks and swung a pretend lightsaber to celebrate Star Wars day. A few weeks later in Eugene he put his hands in the air before the start and called for a \u201cspirit bomb\u201d, a move from the TV show Dragon Ball Z. And when he became the youngest man since 1984 to win the 100m at the US trials he wore Incredibles socks and celebrated with the Shoot dance, popularised by the video game Fortnite. For good measure Lyles is also a budding rapper and has a YouTube channel. His priority for now, though, is to prove himself as the top sprinter in the world \u2013 and make up for lost time having missed last year\u2019s world championships in London due to a torn hamstring, which meant he never got to face Bolt. \u201cAm I sad I didn\u2019t get to race against him at least once? Yes. Maybe now I would have been able to challenge him at the end of his career but, if we\u2019re talking about him in his heyday, I don\u2019t think anyone could really challenge him besides Yohan Blake.\u201d In Birmingham Lyles will race the 100m and believes he could run a personal best of around 9.85sec. However he accepts it will be tough against a stacked field that includes 14 men who have gone under 10 seconds, including the world 60m record holder, Christian Coleman, as well as Zharnel Hughes and Reece Prescod, the European 100m gold and silver medallists. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for Zharnel because I\u2019ve been watching him for a few years,\u201d Lyles says. \u201cHe\u2019s been on that cusp of breaking 10 seconds for the 100m. This year he finally did it and he actually did it on me in Jamaica. I felt really happy for him. I hadn\u2019t heard of Prescod before this year. He has shocked me a little. But it\u2019s great that we have all these athletes facing-off in big races. The sport has a past history of not having the top-tier guys go off against each other, but that\u2019s what people want to see.\u201d Lyles\u2019s best distance is clearly the 200m \u2013 only seven men in history have run faster than his PB of 19.65 \u2013 but he admits it is much tougher in the 100m. \u201cI can\u2019t say I am the dominant figure because I do get beat in the 100m but I am OK with that because it makes the races more exciting,\u201d he says. \u201cIf somebody dominates the whole time people might get a little bit turned off. But when they see competitive rivalry, people get more excited. I get really excited when people talk others up. I say: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got some work to do. I\u2019ve got to change some minds.\u2019\u201d Lyles does not look like a sprinter. He is only 5ft 10in and sinewy rather than ripped but he has excellent genes, given his father, Kevin, was a 45.01sec 400m runner and his mother, Keisha, was an All\u2011American runner at college, and he has a ridiculously fast finish. \u201cI don\u2019t have big bulging muscles,\u201d he concedes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s harder for me to get those first few steps out than some of the other guys. But my ability to turn over is very fast \u2013 and I have a unique ability to have a lot of endurance and be able to hold my top-end for longer than most people can.\u201d That is something the large Birmingham crowd \u2013 and his rivals \u2013 are probably about to find out. Noah Lyles will compete in the 100m at the M\u00fcller Grand Prix Birmingham on Saturday.
