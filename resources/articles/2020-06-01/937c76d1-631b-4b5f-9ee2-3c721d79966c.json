But for the record, let it be known that he did try. When press conferences resumed in the past few days, he was faced almost immediately with a zinger of a question about whether he ever worried the British government\u2019s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic might cost Liverpool their chance to win the Premier League title on the pitch. \u201cI am a sportsperson and I don\u2019t want to say what I really think about the situation because it would open a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cI was not worried for one second the government could cost us the title because I was worried, and I am still worried, about the numbers who were dying.\u201d Klopp also worried that going public with his opinion on Covid-19 would lead to his earlier comments about the Merseyside derby, empty grounds and the physical condition of his players being relatively overlooked. On balance, though, he thought it worthwhile to give his opinion anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for this government, that\u2019s my excuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government was the choice of other people, but the problem I had was that I was getting the news from Germany as well as from England. I have no idea of the pandemic situation in Italy or France, but I do know exactly how it is in England and Germany and an alien looking at it from outside would think we came from two different planets. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we waited until 15 June to start wearing face masks in closed areas, when all the other countries were doing it five or six weeks ago. You can argue about whether it makes sense to wear them but all the countries who started doing it earlier have smaller casualty numbers than England. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d While Klopp\u2019s immediate family are with him on Merseyside, his extended family are in Germany and frequently in touch. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wear a face mask you aren\u2019t allowed into a shop in Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a face mask you can go into a shop or a restaurant, even to a hairdresser. When I go to a petrol station in England I am the only one with a face mask and gloves. I feel like an alien, but I won\u2019t stop until someone tells me it\u2019s over. \u201cI know my family in Germany is living the kind of normal life that we cannot imagine here. You can still have a wonderful night in a restaurant, just wear a face mask to go in and out. It doesn\u2019t sound so difficult to me. It is not perfect in Germany, people have died and people have been ill, but in terms of living your life it is completely different. \u201cBeing here, there were moments when the subject of null-and-voiding the league came up and I just thought: \u2018Wow.\u2019 That would have been really hard for me to take. I always thought we had to finish the season and I\u2019m happy we now have the chance. I love the fact we have to play for it so let\u2019s go. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty intense for a while, but we\u2019ll take it like it is and try our best. Our first game is a tough one, it always would be anywhere in this city. Everton are a good team with an excellent manager and we need to be ready for them.\u201d When Klopp watched Manchester City\u2019s first game back, he was impressed at how strong they looked. \u201cEverything was back to normal straight away on the first day,\u201d he said. \u201cSome strange decisions in one game and Manchester City winning the other. \u201d For all those reasons Klopp tends to doubt whether it will be possible for Liverpool to achieve the sort of dominance over the English game they enjoyed in the years preceding their last title, in 1990. Although he does not mind sticking around trying. \u201cHopefully a lot more seasons will come,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what the future will hold and at the moment we all believe finding a solution to the virus is the most important thing. No one knows exactly what to do at this point. \u201cYou can see Chelsea are pretty much off on the front foot in the transfer market, but no one else has done anything much because the times are so uncertain. If someone were to say, for example, that you can\u2019t play football in front of supporters until 2023, that would change the whole thing. I don\u2019t really think that will happen but you cannot just assume everything is going to be fine for the next season. \u201cIt seems a good time to wait a little bit. It\u2019s like if you live in a flat but want to buy a house, this might not be the best time to buy the house. You would want to wait and see how the situation develops. It feels a little bit like that in the football club as well. We may not be in the most beautiful flat ever, but it\u2019s pretty good. We should not forget that.\u201d Jamie Carragher said last weekend the era of one-club domination is probably over \u2013 after Liverpool\u2019s boom years, Sir Alex Ferguson came along and won 13 titles in 20 years at Manchester United \u2013 and Klopp agrees. \u201cThere are some big teams with big money in this league now so I don\u2019t think it will be the same as it used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Ferguson to win it 13 times is a lot, really a lot. But I am sure he did not set out to do that at the beginning. He was an exceptional manager with a super eye for players, but in the beginning he just did what he did and made some good decisions. \u201cWe can certainly try to do that. We will make good decisions as well and see where it leads us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
