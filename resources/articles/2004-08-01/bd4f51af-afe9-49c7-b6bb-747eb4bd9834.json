Already famed for waggle dances and the way they use visual landmarks to locate a favoured patch of flowers and find their way back to the hive, researchers have now found that bees can repeat these astonishing feats of navigation in the middle of the night. That's despite experiencing light intensities that are more than 100 million times dimmer than daylight. Eric Warrant of the University of Lund, Sweden studied nocturnal bees in the tropical jungles of Barro Colorado island in Panama. Using night-imaging cameras, his team monitored the behaviour of the Central American halictid bee Megalopta genalis, which have become nocturnal to avoid predators. They found that the bees retained remarkable visual skills, despite their relatively insensitive compound eyes. They watched the insects fly reconnaissance missions to learn landmarks around the nest entrance, and use them to find their way home. Moving the landmarks while the bees were away foraging prevented them finding the nest. The scientists say the bees' eyes are only about 30 times more sensitive to light than their daytime cousins - something else, perhaps in the brain, must account for their nocturnal homing abilities. The results appear in this week's Current Biology."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
