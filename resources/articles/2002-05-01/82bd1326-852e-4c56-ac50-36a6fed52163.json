Supporters will be horrified to find out when they arrive that no outdoor screens are being erected for people to watch matches and that few will be able to enjoy the action in bars either. In Sapporo, where England play Argentina on 7 June, the municipal authorities wanted to erect big screens in Odori Park, the city's main green space. But they were forbidden to do so because of an agreement between Japan's satellite broadcasters and Kirch Marketing, the Swiss company which owns the television rights to the World Cup, preventing matches being shown anywhere that 'does not have four walls'. Cities across the country will have one or two indoor big-screen viewing venues but entry is restricted to Japanese residents. Fans hoping to watch games in bars will also be thwarted. Many will be closed during the cup because owners fear hooliganism and aggravation to regular customers. A large number have decided to enforce a 'no foreign fans' policy, while others say only tourists who can speak some Japanese can come in, to avoid communication difficulties with staff. Disgruntled fans heading back to hotel rooms instead will find cold comfort - many lack TVs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
