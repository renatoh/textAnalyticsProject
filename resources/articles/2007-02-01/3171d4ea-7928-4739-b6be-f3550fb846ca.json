Public spending rose absolutely and as a proportion of GDP. But managers - often at generous salaries - have not delivered. There's a sharp sense this spring that money has been diverted, boosting bonuses or paying for adjustments to institutions and procedures with little demonstrable effect on outputs. The Blair government's gambit looks to have failed - its attempt to convince the public that spending was justified because it was accompanied by \"reform\". In health, there's a good case that \"reform\" is the problem. Will Blair's successor attempt more of the same or change his tune? As chancellor and paymaster-general, Gordon Brown knows what the issue is, and how it's playing out in the seasonal pay negotiations. Efficiency seems, so far, to have had little to say about pay. Wages and earnings have risen at a time when the logic of the Gershon report, let alone the Treasury's drive to increase public sector productivity, suggested they should be held back. What is also apparent is that increases for one job bear no obvious relation to those in another position. The vagaries of pay bargaining and industrial muscle compete with rational analysis of what a job entails and the dynamics of the recruitment and retention market. The other week the British Medical Association walked out of negotiations on GP remuneration at the same time as trying the gambit of going to the statutory salary review body, even though most family doctors are self-employed, not salaried. GP rewards have risen after a new contract was signed in 2004, pushing the 2006 average earnings per doctor to \u00a3106,000, for an average working week of 44 hours. GP services are not generally perceived to have improved, even if GPs are meeting - indeed exceeding - targets in the quality framework. Meanwhile, according to Incomes Data Services (IDS), public sector pay last year exceeded the Treasury's official target of 2% for civil servants, local government workers, social workers, nurses and firefighters that would have kept pay at or just below inflation, meaning a 0% increase in real terms. On the basis of the Office for National Statistics' annual survey of hours and earnings, IDS found administrative officers in the civil service got 6.7%, firefighters 4.5%, nurses 4.2% and social workers 3.7%. Clerical officers in local government received 4.4% pay rises. Police officers (below sergeant) and secondary school teachers, however, received 1.9% and 0.8% respectively - a cut in real terms. Mixed and confusing The picture, in other words, is both mixed and confusing. Is there any read across these various groups; can they be compared? We can say that since 2004, the year of Gershon and the last spending review, individual salaries for some staff increased noticeably, without concomitant efficiency gains. At the end of 2005 the Treasury established a review, called the \"gateway\", to ensure departments stuck to 2% in negotiations for 2006-2007. A year on, officials seem pleased with progress. \"The gateway is achieving its objectives by bringing together the right information for ministers to ensure that pay deals are evidentially based and consistent across the public sector,\" said a Treasury spokesman. That's optimism. The Department of Health recommended a rise of 1.5% for the NHS but already others have gone higher. Having taken their case to arbitration, police officers in England and Wales were awarded 3% pay rises. The government had wanted to pay 2.2%, but the Police Federation mustered a politically damaging campaign, arguing that the government couldn't suddenly walk away from pay calculations that had been used for 27 years. In the civil service, the Public and Commercial Services Union says that among departments that have settled, the average increase in the overall wage bill for 2006-2007 is 3.7%. While basic pay will rise by just 1-2.5%, bonuses and \"progression\" take the actual increase over 3%. The Treasury may have underestimated the interconnection between annual pay rises and increments payable under separately negotiated agreements, the biggest of which is Agenda for Change, which reclassifies jobs in the NHS. Even a below-inflation increase in the annual settlement, say 1.5%, could produce an overall increase in the pay bill of 4.5% plus. Rising wage bills Although HM Revenue &amp; Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions are supposed to be cutting over 40,000 jobs by next April, their overall wage bills are rising - and by well in excess of the chancellor's recommended 2%. As part of three-year pay settlements agreed in 2005, HMRC's total bill will rise 5.4% and the DWP's 4.1%. Among the latest pay offers, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Constitutional Affairs both propose increases totalling 3.5%, education 4%, the environment and transport departments 3.1%, the prison service 3.6% and Land Registry 3.2%. Gordon Brown has long favoured abandonment of national pay bargaining in the public sector as a way of cutting labour costs, and 2007 may be his moment. The system is confusing. According to IDS, police officers, teachers and nurses in London get an extra \u00a35,000-\u00a36,300 a year, yet for other public sector workers, inner London allowances are \u00a32,000-\u00a33,200, even though all face similarly high living costs. City of London and Metropolitan police officers receive the highest premium of \u00a36,333, followed by experienced teachers on \u00a35,787 and staff at the Audit Commission on \u00a35,269 a year. At the bottom of the league are support workers in further education who get \u00a32,078. But public sector staff are a formidable block, within Labour ranks as much as anywhere. Taking benefits away is hard politics. \u00b7 This article appears in the new edition of the Guardian's Public magazine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
