While no one expects Ben\u00edtez to stick around on Tyneside should his new team be relegated, it had been thought that if Sunderland went down Allardyce would remain in charge at the Stadium of Light. That may indeed be the case but, unusually, he turned distinctly coy, refusing to be drawn when asked if his agreement included an exit clause. \u201cMy contract is none of your business,\u201d said a manager aiming to increase Sunderland\u2019s run of six straight wins against Newcastle, at St James\u2019 Park on Sunday. With one north-east club almost certain to be relegated in May, and the cost of missing out on next season\u2019s Premier League broadcast deal amounting to at least \u00a3100m, Ben\u00edtez hopes to mark his first home game by ending that sequence. If his desire to put Allardyce, a long-time adversary, in his place, should not be underestimated, there are much bigger things at stake. \u201cI decided to come here because I knew how big this club is,\u201d said the former Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager. \u201cIt\u2019s a sleeping giant. If we stay up - and I\u2019m sure we will - we can achieve things. We can improve a lot next season. I have confidence we\u2019ll stay up and I\u2019m sure everything will be fine. I\u2019m sure next year we\u2019ll do a great season.\u201d Ben\u00edtez - who has made it clear he will not countenance the lack of control over player recruitment experienced by Steve McClaren and Alan Pardew - has yet to speak to Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, although victory on Sunday might change that. Conversely, defeat would puncture the new-found optimism at the club. Asked if it would be a disaster, Ben\u00edtez\u2019s reply was instructive. \u201cIt\u2019s always a disaster if you lose, but especially against Sunderland it will be more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will happen but, if something goes wrong, we have to be ready for the next game [at Norwich].\u201d Having inherited an imbalanced and injury-ravaged squad, low on defenders and strikers but full of attacking midfielders, he is effectively coaching with one hand tied behind his back. \u201cWe\u2019re not scoring goals and we\u2019re conceding a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have problems everywhere. But we have quality, we have some good players - we have to coordinate the team more.\u201d He is excited by Gini Wijnaldum, the Dutch creator. \u201cHe\u2019s of the players that, as managers, we enjoy coaching; he has pace, he has ability,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cHis best position is the problem - he\u2019s so good he can play everywhere and do well. \u201cWe were thinking about where to play him and said: \u2019His best position could be behind the striker.\u2019 But he can play on the right, on the left, in a deeper position or up front, too, because he\u2019s so good. I think he\u2019s best behind the striker, but his quality can help us in any position.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
