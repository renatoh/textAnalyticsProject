Ahead twice through Dennis Wyness and generally the more capable in most areas, Inverness Caledonian Thistle were denied passage to the last four by a resurgence of spirit in the Partick Thistle ranks rather than exceptional play. Being installed odds-on favourites is no guarantee of superiority, a truth with which the Firhill side would become familiar early in this match. Even in the six minutes that preceded Inverness's first goal, there was enough to convince anyone that the visiting team were the more comfortable, with and without the ball. In possession, they were more mobile, fluent and imaginative than a Partick side that often appeared to lack self-certainty and a sense of direction. There was an aimlessness about them for a long time that would reinforce the argument that they are a long way short of Premier League material. Having beaten Inverness three times in their First Division meetings this season, the evidence suggests that the Glasgow firm are more formidable in the league than they showed for much of the time in this cup tie. For most of the time in this encounter, it seemed that they had also learnt more about how to combat their habitual rivals than vice versa. Compact and alert in defence, dominant in midfield and more dangerous in attack throughout the first half, the one-goal advantage was the least they deserved. It was Barry Robson who started the move that brought the lead, playing the ball down the left to Roy McBain. The wing-back delivered an impeccable cross between defenders to Wyness, who swept the ball past Kenny Arthur. Wyness was unfortunate not to score a second before the interval when he received another through-ball from Robson on the left of the area, his angled drive hitting the side netting. However, after the break, he did score again, restoring Inverness's lead soon after Martin Hardie had scored the home side's first equaliser. Hardie produced a terrific finish to the long, high, hanging ball Stephen Craigan delivered from the right, controlling with his left and switching to his right for a low, 12-yard drive past Nicky Walker. The home fans' relief was short-lived as the Highlanders regained the lead within three minutes. This was due to a combination of quick thinking on their part and some appalling defending. Grant Munro's long pass seemed to be covered by two Partick players, but they moved forward, allowing the ball to pass over their heads to defender Bobby Mann, who was still upfield after a corner. From the right of the area, he played the ball across the box and Wyness prodded it over the line from eight yards. The overall control of Inverness made Partick's second equaliser something of a surprise, although its execution was exceptional. From a corner on the left, the ball fell to Scott Paterson just inside the 18-yard line and the defender met it on the volley, sending the ball hurtling high to the right of Walker. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
