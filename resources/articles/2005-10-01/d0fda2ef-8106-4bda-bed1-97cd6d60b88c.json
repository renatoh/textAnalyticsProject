In the past Which? (formerly the Consumers' Association) and HBOS have both suggested such a system, using 'at-a-glance' green and red signs indicating whether the ATM is free, and if not how much it charges. The typical charge is \u00a31.50 but sometimes \u00a32.50 or more. On Thursday both Nationwide and Halifax announced they were to introduce the green signs on all their ATMS. This is a great move in the right direction as the two institutions own just over 9 per cent of the ATM network and 15 per cent of the available free machines between them. It is particularly welcome coming from Halifax. Last week independent ATM operator Cardpoint announced it had made huge profits from 275 of the 800 machines it bought from the bank, which it has converted into charging ATMs. While the addition of fee-charging machines in some locations - such as pubs or clubs - is welcome, their rapid spread should concern people. While there were virtually none five years ago, they now account for more than 40 per cent of all ATMs in the country. In the last year 3,500 new ones were installed, compared with 600 free ones. If this continues, free machines may disappear altogether. Awareness about fees is therefore vital if we are to be able to make a choice. Other institutions should follow Nationwide and Halifax's example."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
