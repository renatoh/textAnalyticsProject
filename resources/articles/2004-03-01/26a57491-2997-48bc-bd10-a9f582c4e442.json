Akarus, in the \u00a358,000 John Smith's Midlands Grand National, and Vodka Bleu can give the champion trainer a precious double. A narrowly beaten second in this stamina test last year, Akarus (2.55) has excellent prospects of going one better. He was disputing the lead and going well when falling four out in the Welsh National and was surely feeling the effects of that tumble when running poorly next time. With Tony McCoy on duty here rather than Ascot, it is safe to assume that Akarus has been giving out the right signals at home again. LINGFIELD 1.35: The betting should provide the best clue to this, the first two-year-old race of the year. His Majesty represents a winning all-weather team and is speedily bred. NEWCASTLE 1.50: Possibly still in need of the race when staying on to finish third at Market Rasen, General Duroc can uphold his trainer Richard Phillips' good record at this course. UTTOXETER 1.55: With a pull of 11lbs for a beating of less than two lengths at Market Rasen, Annie Byers can turn the tables on Bathwick Annie. LINGFIELD 2.05: Darryll Holland won two good sprints on Striking Ambition last season, and from stall one the combination could be hard to peg back from a quick break. ASCOT 2.10: Provided the first-time blinkers do the trick, Chicago Bulls should be able to confirm the promise of his creditable Cheltenham third behind Therealbandit. UTTOXETER 2.25: Until he missed the cut, Vodka Bleu was due to take his chance in the Pertemps Final at Cheltenham last Tuesday. This looks a good chance for Martin Pipe's five-year-old, who ran his best race over hurdles so far when a strong-finishing fifth behind Mythical King (now 7lbs worse) at Ascot. LINGFIELD 2.35: Grand Passion is proven on the Polytrack, but meets a better calibre of opposition here, notably Private Charter whose smart efforts last year included a five lengths third behind Kris Kin at Chester. ASCOT 2.40: Irish trainer Tony Martin picks his targets carefully over here, and his decision to bypass the Coral Cup at Cheltenham with his very easy Fairyhouse winner Dantes Reef can pay dividends. NEWCASTLE 2.50: Sent off favourite when pulled up early owing to a slipping saddle at Hexham on Thursday, Jericho III is one to keep an eye on. LINGFIELD 3.10: On the evidence of his smart efforts on the dirt at Nad Al Sheba, Rosencrans will be hard to beat. He won by a wide margin last time, and this is his trip. ASCOT 3.15: Though now into the veteran stage, Lord Of The River has a race of this nature in him judging by his Newbury run behind Midland Flame. NEWCASTLE 3.25: A game front-runner, the recent Ayr winner Superior Weapon still looks well handicapped."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
