The 28-year-old, whose straw-blond hair and vivid blue eyes make him a standout in his usual stamping ground in the far east, birdied three of the last four holes for a 66 and a 14-under-par 270 to tie with the Australian Richard Green. Green, a left-hander, packed eight birdies into his 65 - four in a row for an outward 31 - but could not match Dyson's 12-foot birdie putt for three at the 18th the second time around. A week after Marc Warren, a member of the winning Walker Cup side of 2001, scored his first Tour win after a play-off against Robert Karlsson in the Scandinavian Masters, this was an uncanny action replay with Dyson having played for the triumphant Walker Cup side of 1999. The young man who considered following his uncle Terry Dyson, a member of Tottenham Hotspur's double-winning side of 1960-61 into football - he was on the books of York City as a teenager - has been among the most consistent of players over the past two summers. In 2005 he had eight top-20 finishes, including second place in the Asian Open to add to three Asia Tour successes in 2000 in the Macau, China and Hong Kong Opens. This year he followed his breakthrough in Jakarta in the Indonesian Open with seven more top-12 placings and yesterday's \u00a3180,000 victory nudged his season's official earnings to a personal best of \u00a3622,000. \"I won well in Indonesia by holding on to a two-stroke lead down the straight but this was even better - I really won it with those birdies at 15, 16 and 17,\" he said. 'The first win is special but this is even more special because it gets me into the top 15 in the money list and the top 100 in the world, which opens up so many more doors - I just can't wait to win again.\" For Green, 35, whose solitary Tour win was in the 1997 Dubai Desert Classic after a play-off against Greg Norman and Ian Woosnam, history repeated itself. In the 2004 Dutch Open he was three shots clear going into the last four but finished joint second behind England's David Lynn. This was his sixth runner-up finish in Europe. The overnight leader, Ireland's Damien McGrane, managed only two birdies in a 70 to finish third, a stroke behind the leading pair. Although the sun finally shone in Holland after a stormy week Colin Montgomerie stayed in the shadows. The 43-year-old Scot talked fighting talk after popping in the professional shop to invest \u00a3125 in a putter after three-putting four times in Friday's second round, then shot 67 on Saturday, declaring: \"A good start tomorrow and I could win.\" After a 69 for a seven-under 277 - \"all a bit bitty\" - he pronounced himself \"happy enough\" with his first outing since missing the cut in the Open at Hoylake. \"I had six twos in the week but never really had a chance to win but I'm putting better, going to the USPGA,' he said, ahead of next week's USPGA in Chicago. Would he persevere with his new club after discarding his belly putter? \"I'll stay with the method definitely - the puttee will stay the same but not necessarily the putter,\" added the man who had to settle for second in the US Open at Winged Foot earlier this year. The Ryder Cup captain Ian Woosnam, whose 70 for 277 left him one behind Paul McGinley looked surprised when he was told that the Irishman, 10th in the cup points table, would miss the USPGA Championship to attend Darren Clarke's wife's funeral. \"I can understand it but I wonder if Heather would have wanted him to do that,\" said Woosnam."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
