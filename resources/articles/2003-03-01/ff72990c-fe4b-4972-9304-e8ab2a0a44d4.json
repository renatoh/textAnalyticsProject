Sensational news from the San Siro. Inter have kicked off, the ball has been in play for several seconds and Craig Bellamy has not - I repeat not been sent off yet. Within 30 seconds, Andy O'Brien is responsible for a horrendous defensive gaffe that lets Emre in. He shoots over the bar when he should have scored. A terrible miss and a let-off for Newcastle. 2 mins: Coco finds Gugli (Andrea Guglielminpietro to his mum), who seeks out Vieri in the Newcastle box. His pass is too weighty and goes harmlessly wide. 4 mins: Zanetti is penalised for fouling Robert on the left wing, deep in the Inter half. the free is swung in and Newcastle win a corner, from which Nobby Solano has a stunning shot clawed clear off the angle of post and crossbar by Toldo in the Inter goal. 6 mins: Coco shoots across the face of goal after a great move by Inter. Given puts it out for a corner-kick, which the Irishman then does well to gather. This game has begun at a frantic pace, and the apparent reluctance of the Italian TV company to show replays is making it rather difficult for me to do it justice. It could be 2-2 by now, but it ain't. 9 mins: After the early blood and thunder, the game has slowed down a tad. Bellamy takes on Cordoba down the left wing, tries to cross and wins a corner-kick. Robert swings it in and Toldo gets his fist to it. 11 mins: I've just seen Solano's shot (4 mins) again. It was unbelievably good, and hit the crossbar before it hit Toldo. Indeed, it could easily have gone in off the Italian goalkeeper's back. It's a shame it didn't go in, because he's unlikely to hit a fottball that well again if he lives to be as old as his manager. 15 mins: Lull! Lull! Lull! Lull! 16 mins: Okan lets Jermaine Jenas make a monkey of him and the young midfielder wins a corner after more smart defending from Cordoba. Solano wellies it into the box and Inter clear. 18 mins: Toldo beats a close Solano effort clear at the near post after a low cross from Shearer eluded the entire Inter defence. Unlucky. \"Knowing you're a Sunderland fan, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on having Mick McCarthy as the manager of the team,\" muses Kevin Kennedy, who doesn't play Curly in Coronation Street, Not that I'm saying you lot are predictable, of course. (Okay, I am.). \"What measures do you think Mick will take and do you think that he will possibly try and buy some new solid players like Roy Keane to help to stave off relegation. Also, are you going to try and get the minute by minute rugby gig on Ireland v England.\" I have yet to form an opinion on Mick McCarthy's World Cup antics, never mind his imminent appointment as Sunderland manager, Kevin. And as for the Ireland v England rugby match - I'll be in the pub for that, if not Lansdowne Road. I'd like to think it will be a Grand Slam decider, but will be highly amused if England get beaten by Scotland before they come to Dublin. 22 mins: Another great opportunity for Newcastle, as Jenas slaloms his way through the entire defence. He shoots when he should have crossed and the scoring opportunity goes a begging. 23 mins: Elsewhere in Europe, Arsenal are beating Roma 1-0 and Francesco Totti has been sent off. In this group, Barcelona are beating Bayer Leverkusen 1-0. Emre trips Shearer in the centre-circle and concedes a free. 25 mins: Zanetti bursts through the middle and shoots low and hard from distance. Given gets down and smothers it with a minimum of fuss. 27 mins: After brushing against Bernard on the edge of the Newcastle box, Conceicao goes down as if he's been shot in the back. Newcastle play on and Jenas is fouled by Zanetti at the far end of the field. Zanetti promptly accuses the Newcastle player of diving, an allegation which, coming from an Inter player - they've been going down like Jenna Jameson all night - is a little bit rich. Conceicao is stretchered off under a blanket. Bless. 30 mins: Bellamy turns on a sixpence and shoots in the Inter box but Toldo saves. Newcastle are definitely having the better of this game after a bad start. Conceicao, who is back on the field, gets booked for a late tackle on Laurent Robert. Titus Bramble gets booked for handball. It looks a harsh decision as it seemed accidental. Then again, most things Titus Bramble does look accidental. 33 mins: Emre pumps a free-kick into the Newcastle box. Jenas heads it over the bar for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 34 mins: \"That's a really weird picture you have of Wilko. Is he wearing lipstick in it?\" enquires Bernard O'Leary [of the picture of Howard Wilkinson I did have in the top right hand corner of this report, before I replaced it with one of Alan Shearer and Gary Speed.] No Bernard, I think his lips have gone that colour because he's pursing them so hard at the sight of his former charges scoring their third own-goal against Charlton Athletic. I think Olivier Bernard just got booked. I have no idea why, but I'd imagine Portuguese thespian and Greg Louganis-a-like Sergio Conceicao had something to do with it. Francis Jeffers could learn a thing or two from him about cheating. Compared to Sergio, the jug-eared Arsenal reserve is a ham-fisted amateur. 39 mins: Titus Bramble does excellently to stop Christian Vieri skinning him through the middle. He's been excellent so far and, amazingly enough, has Vieri in his pocket. 41 mins: GOAL Inter 0 - 1 Newcastle Craig Bellamy breezed past Gugli in the right-back position as if the Milan player wasn't there, rolled it past Toldo and across the face of the goal, where Alan Shearer had the relatively easy task of sidefooting it home from all of two yards. A hint of offside, but the goal stands. 44 mins: Bellamy finds Robert with a great overhead kick (not unlike the one Chris Marsden scored with for Southampton against Wolves last Sunday) down the left wing. With three Newcastle players to aim for in the Inter box, he crosses it straight into Toldo's arms. Very poor. Half-time 45 mins: \"Pity New Zealand didn't thrash the Aussies for us today,\" writes Chris Copeland, apropos of nothing whatsoever. \"However, there is a strange crumb of comfort to be had from the fact that when we got them down to Bevan and Bichel they only won with two balls to spare, whereas they really hammered the Kiwis.\" Finally, he gets to the point: \"I do like football too, honest,\" he continues. \"Come on the Toon Army!\" 46 mins: Inter 1 - 1 Newcastle. Christian Vieri scores his first European goal in over a year. Martins, who has replaced somebody or other on the Inter team, found Conceicao on the right wing. The Portuguese chancer crossed brilliantly and Vieri got between Gary Speed and Andy O'Brien to head home. He wheels away from goal, pulls off his shirt and reveals a with a big red lover-heart on the front. Aw shucks. 48 mins: GOAL Inter 1 - 2 Newcastle Christ on a bike I wish these guys would slow down. From way out, Robert crossed deep into the Inter box. Toldo came to gather on the edge of the six-yard box and spilled it. Coco's hapless attempt to mop up his goalkeeper's mess falls to Shearer, who steers the ball into an empty net. A great poacher's goal, but what on earth was Toldo doing? 51 mins: After a clash with Emre, Andy O'Brien's (inordinately large) nose is gushing blood. Elsewhere in this group, Barcelona are two up against Bayer Leverkusen. In Highbury, Arsenal and 10-man Roma are drawing 1-1. After getting his (inordinately large) nose cleaned up, Andy O'Brien is attempting to get back on but the referee won't let him return to the foray. Himself, Bobby Robson and the fourth official are having a right old ding-dong on the touchline. 55 mins: Bellamy and Shearer combine well in a move that starts with Bellamy flicking the ball to Shearer from the halfway line and picking it up again moments later on the right-hand side of the Inter box. His attempted cross is poor and Inter Milan clear. 57 mins: Shearer catches Fabio Cannavaro in the chin with an elbow that - despite his form in this field - looks genuinely accidental. Speaking of form, Shearer's horse Intersky Falcon didn't win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham today. 59 mins: Andy O'Brien has been replaced by ... er, I dunno. Given gets down like lightning to save well from Vieri. 60 mins: GOAL! Inter 2 - 2 Newcastle All five feet eight inches of Ivan Cordoba leap prodigiously past Gary Speed in the air and bury an inswinging free-kick firmly into the bottom right-hand corner of the Newcastle goal. An unstoppable header. 63 mins: Bellamy gets booked for diving in the Inter penalty area after knocking the ball past Toldo. It's a fair cop, guv. Toldo very cleverly pulled out of his challenge once he realised that Bellamy was going to go down, with the result that the Newcastle striker ended up looking a complete eejit. 64 mins: Newcastle win a free-kick about 40 yards out after Cordoba fouls Shearer. The ball is rolled to the Newcastle captain but he sends it screaming over the bar. By the way, Aaron Hughes came on for Andy O'Brien, and Christian Vieri has been booked for kicking the ball away in a hissy fit after a decision didn't go his way. 69 mins: \"Give us your opinion on the McCarthy coming,\" writes the splendidly monikered John R Barrington, who signs his mail JR in the craven hope that we won't wheel out the \"splendidly monikered\" gag out again. Like I said John, I don't have an opinion on the McCarthy coming yet. I'm working on it. Under pressure from Titus Bramble in the Newcastle box, Vieri goes down like a Kings Cross hooker. No penalty. 72 mins: Griffin crosses from the right wing, and Speed leaps - Barry rummages in his box of leaping metaphors, disregards stag and salmon and picks the only one left - gazelle-like into the air to head the ball over the crossbar. 74 mins: Chris Copeland is back: \"Lovely Jenna Jameson (27 mins) analogy there, but what do you think of the challenger to her porn throne, Briana Banks?\" he enquires. \"If Inter players were to go down like her ... well, the mental picture is staggering.\" Unfortunately Chris, I'm afraid I'm not familiar with Ms Banks's work, although the name does ring a bell. I did attempt to find a picture of Ms Jameson but, funnily enough, she doesn't figure in the Guardian's archives. Emre makes way for Giovanni Pasquale, who may or may not be related to squeaky voiced end-of-pier comedian Joe. 79 mins: Di Biagio crosses from the right and Martins attempts a fancy-dan scissors-kick when a header would probably have sufficed. He misses. 80 mins: This irrefutable wisdom from Barrie MacAndrew: \"It's refreshing to see Sunderland ringing the changes at last, replacing a dour Yorkshireman with a reputation for producing route-one football teams with a dour Yorkshireman with a reputation for producing route-one football teams. The question is, should I renew my season ticket or try the cheaper alternative and get some Mogadon on prescription?\" I hear you Barrie, even if you do spell your name in a girly (or should that be girlie?) fashion. 82 mins: LuaLua and Viana come on. Robert and Solano come off. 83 mins: Pasquale hares down the left wing but is dispossessed before he gets the opportunity to crack any lame gags in a peculiar voice. Surely he'd be more at home talking to Des O'Connor and Melanie Sykes in front of an incontinent live audience on lunchtime television. 84 mins: Griffin blocks an attempted Coco cross. Not very interesting, but there you go. Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger. 86 mins: Joe Pasquale crosses from the left and Bernard clears. 86 mins: Jenas hits a fairly feeble shot from distance that trickles harmlessly wide, when he should really have slipped the ball through to Bellamy who was unmarked in the box. \"Can you do me a favour and let us know if Craig Bellamy does anything likeable?\" enquires Dan. Will do, but don't hold your breath. 90 mins: The Newcastle fans strike up a chorus of \"Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!\" as, once again, Sergio Conceicao tumbles under a non-challenge from Olivier Bernard on the right corner of the Newcastle box. Di Biagio stands over the ball, but a melee develops when the Newcastle wall refuse to retreat the full 10 yards. LuaLua has a dig at Vieri and gets booked. 90 +3 mins: After all that, DiBiagio buries the ball into the Newcastle wall. 90 + 4 mins: A horde of winged monkeys descend from the roof of the stand and their leader, a mixture of blood and drool dripping from his jagged fangs, swoops and grabs Alan Shearer by the shoulders in his talons before whisking him out of the San Siro and into the sky. Actually no, that's a slight exaggeration. Shearer gets booked for not letting Toldo take a kick-out. The referee blows for full time. Post-amble: \"Please, no more sex-related going-down puns,\" writes Ashley Cotter-Cairns who, by his/her own account, is even more splendidly monikered than John R Barrington. \"Use 'Going down like a certain north-eastern team, no matter who manages them', instead.\" Very droll, Ashley. One small problem, though: I'll decide who's slendidly monikered in my own match reports, thank you very much. You can't just decide your own moniker is splendid, because if everyone did that we'd have complete anarchy. Anyway, to the business in hand. Newcastle are not out of the Champions League yet, although their future is no longer in their own hands. They need to beat Barcelona at home next week and hope Inter Milan don't beat Bayer Leverkusen.
