The 22-year-old Cardiff City striker scored his country's first hat-trick in 12 years in Wednesday's rout of Scotland at the Millennium Stadium, seizing upon the absence of John Hartson and Craig Bellamy to swell his international goal tally to a staggering six in only 10 matches. \"I know I can score goals at whatever level,\" said Earnshaw, who has now notched 27 times for club and country this season. \"I'd like to think that, if I step up, I can handle it. Whatever I do in life I have that attitude to take everything in my stride. It's taken me a long way. I know people are watching me but I don't really think about what might happen in the future.\" Cardiff would be reluctant sellers but, given that they are reportedly around \u00a316m in debt, the First Division club would struggle to reject a sizeable bid for their prize asset. In the meantime, Earnshaw has given himself a chance of retaining his place in the starting line-up when Wales travel to Hungary next month. \"I don't want just to come in and fill certain people's boots or anything,\" added the City striker, who started last November's Euro 2004 play-off with Russia on the bench and was introduced to play out of position. \"Obviously, John Hartson and Craig Bellamy are great players, but I'm my own player and I'd like to think I can bring something different to the team and be myself. It's nice to put myself in Mark Hughes's thoughts and, with a bit of luck, I can be more than just a substitute. It was just nice to get the Russia business out of our system and turn in that sort of performance.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
