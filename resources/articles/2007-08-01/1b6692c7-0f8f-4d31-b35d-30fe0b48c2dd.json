The Paraguay striker, a summer arrival from Bayern Munich, netted on his debut in Saturday's 2-1 win against Middlesbrough and struck in the fifth minute of the opening leg in Scandinavia after being set up by Jason Roberts. His manager Mark Hughes believes that his instant impact at the start of the season has silenced the critics who questioned the transfer. \"Roque's scoring record in Germany was an issue for some people but not me,\" he said. \"He is a match winner and will score a lot of goals for us, of that I am sure. It was an excellent finish so early in the game. He showed his quality and getting a full game will help him. We are encouraged by Roque, so early in his career here and he can only get better. To be honest I am surprised by how quickly he seems to have adapted. You have to compliment him on the way he trains and plays.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
