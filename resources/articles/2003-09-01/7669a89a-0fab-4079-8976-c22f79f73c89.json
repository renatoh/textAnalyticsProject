Let's recap. Patrick Vieira stayed where he was after a man told him to go away (one charge of improper conduct). Jens Lehmann told the man he did not think Vieira should have been told go away (one charge of improper conduct). Martin Keown jumped very high in the air (one charge of improper conduct). Lauren looked at Ryan Giggs in a funny way (one charge of improper conduct). Giggs frowned, holding his thick-set eyebrows at a dangerous angle (one charge of improper conduct). Ashley Cole said a bad word in a working-class accent to Cristiano Ronaldo (one charge of improper conduct). Ronaldo got all hot and red in the face (one charge of improper conduct). And Lauren, Keown and Ray Parlour scared a horse and made it gallop off (loads more charges here, not exactly sure of the details though, to be honest we've confused ourselves now). And, eh, that's it. All good clean knockabout fun, and the sort of thing we all enjoy, let's please face up to this fact once and for all. But in addition to the punishments detailed so confusingly above, the Sanctimony Association have also charged Arsenal FC with \"failing to ensure the proper behaviour of their players\", and wagged a stern finger in Phil Neville's face telling him to behave in future else it's the birch. Quick, throw some heavy hessian over that wagging digit, in case a nearby woman experiences the devil's rumbling in her lower abdomen! QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Arsenal came with the intention of not conceding a goal. I don't think you will ever see United players celebrating like that after a 0-0 draw\" - Ryan Giggs is right, celebrating a 0-0 draw is embarrassing. Skittering across the Highbury pitch after a 2-2 draw and punching the air like you've won Big Cup is another matter altogether though, as Mr Fergie can confirm. FIFA RANKINGS STORY It was going to be a day like any other. The Fiver would sleep off its industrial-strength hangover, roll up to work an hour-and-a-half late, make the tea and dribble quietly in the corner. Then Fifa released their latest world rankings - and all hell broke loose. The Fiver suspected it was on to quite a story when it gazed emptily at the first line of the report on Fifa's website. \"Stepping up a gear in September,\" raged the article, \"the international football calendar has witnessed a host of matches!\" There was nothing for it but to fend off impending sleep by reading on and finding out what all the fuss was about. And what a fuss it was! Ka-pow! England up two places to sixth! Ka-zam! Scotland up six to joint 53rd, leaving Austria and Trinidad &amp; Tobago in their wake! Tok! Wales down one to joint 53rd! Zing! Northern Ireland up one to 111th! Paf! The Republic of Ireland down one to 14th! [The Fiver shuffles uncomfortably as it realises the entire story has just been told in a few lines with a whole paragraph still to go, then pens some extraneous nonsense to make the middle chunk feel like it's pulling its weight.] But the Fiver hasn't made its reputation by being a parochial little Britisher (or by recycling lame gags about how uninspired it feels today). So here are a few handy lines on some Johnny Foreigners. \"No changes amongst the leaders,\" screamed the Fifa website enticingly, which means it's Brazil first, France second and Spain third. However - however! - Argentina have replaced Mexico in fourth. Er, Turkey are down to seventh. And, um, the Czech Republic and Germany are up to joint ninth. But the news that probably won't stop the press is that Botswana have claimed a \"best-ever berth\", in 118th! Now if you'll excuse us, we have some work to do. JUST TWO DAYS LEFT IN THE INAUGURAL FIVER PR PERSON OF THE YEAR AWARD 2003!!! AND WE MEAN IT THIS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The end is finally nigh, readers. This Friday is your VERY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE BIG SHINY PR GONG. Yes we've said it before, but because we're starting to look like shameless hacks on the scrounge (eh?), this time we really do mean it. To be honest, though, the Fiver's in no mood to file a new PR entry today anyway. You see, we're nursing a fuzzy head from last night's revelry. Maybe we shouldn't have glugged back a whole bottle of whisky, but then it was a very fine drop. Not the kind of stomach-stripper Fatha Fiver slurps through a straw, but a bottle of 25-year-old Cutty Sark, aged to absolute perfection. And while it wasn't cheap, you really do get what you pay for. So impressed was the Fiver, in fact, that we've spent the morning logged on to the homepage of the people wot peddle said brew, PR collective The Nuance Group (www.thenuancegroup.com). And we're mighty glad we did, for it turns out that if you visit a Travel Shopping store in Luton, London City, Belfast International and Bristol &amp; Cardiff airports, it's available at a knock-down price. Marvellous. A normal PR-plugging service will return tomorrow, so you'd do well to ENTER THE RACE by sending goods to The Fiver, Fiver Towers, 3-7 Ray Street, London EC1R 3DR! THE RUMOUR MILL Mop-topped managerial maverick Klaus Toppmoller is reported to have held talks with several Tottenham suits last night. Sunderland have agreed a fee with Watford for striker Tommy Smith. They're not saying how much, so we're guessing more than a score but less than a monkey. And despite being untried and untested in the cut-throat world of football management, Tony Adams has emerged as the new favourite for the Reading job. Anything's better than Glenn Hoddle, eh? NEWS IN BRIEF Paul Scholes could be back from a hernia problem as early as next week, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will miss the next three months as he recovers from knee-knack surgery. \"It's a blow for us,\" wheezed Mr Fergie. Napoli have been ordered to play their next five home games behind closed doors after a fan died and more than 30 police were injured during violence at the weekend in Avellino. And Ipswich skipper Jim Magilton has apologised after his four-letter outburst during the 4-1 win over Wimbledon at Portman Road. \"I apologise sincerely for any offence I caused or upset to our fans,\" sniffed Jim, who has become a target for terrace abuse of late. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Five: Euro Vase Football - Liverpool v Olimpija Ljubljana (7.05pm) If you don't much fancy an irate Tyke arguing the toss, move on to the Futbol Mundial listing now, where you'll find an all-Ireland Bad Ad special. Sky Sports 1: Gillette Soccer Special (7pm) If you do, though, read on. \"If Nigel Townsend wants to criticise Tyke icons like Fred Trueman he should at least get 'is facts right,\" barks Chris Acton, referring to yesterday's TV section. You're On Sky Sports (10pm) \"Fred used to advertise not Webster's Green Label bitter as Townsend claimed, but the stable's Pennine Bitter, and a fine pint it was too,\" he adds. \"What's more, the breathing fire bit was also true, only Fred demonstrated the wrong orifice. European Pro-Beach Soccer (11pm) \"PS: If you're at all interested, Green Label was a bottled beer that was later brought out as a draught ale to replace Webster's Best, after whi...\" Futbol Mundial (12am, 6.30 &amp; 10.30pm on SS2) Now, where were we? Ah yes. \"The most irritating ad I can remember on Ulster Television,\" writes John McNally, \"in between the ones for sheep wormer, was the ad for Fairhill Shopping Centre, in Ballymena.\" Sky Sports 2: Live Carling Cup: Coventry City v Tottenham (7pm, repeated SS1: 12.30am) Hmm, remind us. \"Well, it featured some bloke standing in the middle of a field in his wellies, because, and this is the really clever bit, Fairhill Shopping Centre is apparently the best... in its field! Eurosport: Euro Vase - Southampton v Steaua Bucharest (7pm) \"What's more, the ad wrapped up with the hilarious catchphrase, whined out in deepest Ballymena brogue - 'It's a big shopping centre in Ballymena - hey!'\" Women's World Cup: (10pm) The Fiver remains unconvinced. \"But if you've ever heard anyone from Ballymena talk,\" retorts McNally, \"you'll realise why this is annoying.\" We haven't, so let's move swiftly on. Radio 5 Live: Sport On 5 (7pm) \"In the early '80s,\" announces Alan Gregg, \"Ireland enjoyed an ad/public service announcement which appealed for financial aid for deaf children.\" Talksport: Football First (7pm) Not, in itself, unusual. \"Indeed,\" adds Alan, \"only they made me wonder where all the money was going as the treatment seemed to consist of a nun shouting 'bah' very loudly into a child's ear. Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) \"It was quite disturbing,\" he concludes, from the far safer environs of Toronto.
