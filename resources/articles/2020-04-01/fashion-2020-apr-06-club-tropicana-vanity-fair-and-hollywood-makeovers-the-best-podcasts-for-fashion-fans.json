For beauty fans, semi-spinoff Make Me Over takes that to the next level. From the birth of waterproof makeup (thanks to Million Dollar Mermaid star Esther Williams) to the racism (and subsequent skin bleaching) endured by the actor Merle Oberon, this miniseries is filled with You Must Remember This\u2019s signature mix of glamour and dread. Leah Harper Available on Apple The Collector\u2019s House Ever wanted to know what Kanye West is like to work with or why Luton Town FC are called the Hatters? Then look no further than the matchesfashion.com\u2019s podcast series, presented by the fashion journalist Danielle Radojcin. Each 40-minute episode is an informal conversation recorded in the attic of Matchesfashion.com\u2019s broadcasting and showroom hub, Carlos Place in Mayfair, London. Highlights include the photographer Nick Knight talking about the influence of skinheads on his adolescence, and photographing campaigns for Fendi. The milliner Stephen Jones discusses his treasured top hats, working with Dior and Marc Jacobs, and shares a potted history of hatmaking in Britain, while the artist Shirin Neshat gives her views on the #metoo movement, and Iran and feminism today. Helen Seamons Available on matchesfashion.com Nobody Panic An apt title for the current climate, perhaps, but the hosts, Stevie Martin and Tessa Coates, have been running this show since 2017, when it was known as The Debrief Podcast. Weekly episodes are squarely aimed at a millennial audience, offering a \u201cguidebook to being a fully functioning adult without screaming all the time\u201d and have previously covered ethical fashion (What Is It and How Can I Do It?) and how to be more stylish on a budget \u2013 although it\u2019s worth rooting through the back catalogue for gems such as How to Keep Your Houseplant(s) Alive and How to Deal With the News Without Crying. LH Available on Acast and Apple Dior Talks The first series of this new podcast hones in on feminist art, a theme that is also central to each of Dior designer Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s collections. Every episode is hosted by London-based art historian and writer Katy Hessel, who meet and interviews the notable female artists, including Tracey Emin and Judy Chicago. Dior Talks offers access to intimate discussions of their work, their relationship to the art, and the ways in which their work has influenced Dior\u2019s collections. Peter Bevan Available on Spotify, Apple, and dior.com Great Lives The biographical series, which asks its guests to pick one person who has inspired them, is just as likely to cover Victorian social reformers as it is to touch on anything fashion-related, but within the back catalogue there is plenty for those on the hunt for style content. A recent episode saw Channel 4 News\u2019s international editor, Lindsey Hilsum, delve into the incredible life of Lee Miller, the supermodel, journalist and Pablo Picasso muse who reported on the horrors of the second world war for Vogue. Others include the author Hanif Kureishi talking all things David Bowie \u2013 from music to makeup and androgynous style \u2013 and the singer Mica Paris on Josephine Baker, her dance sauvage and her radical claiming of black beauty in the 1920s. Ellie Violet Bramley Available on BBC Sounds The Vanity Fair Diaries by Tina Brown Technically an audiobook, not a podcast, but still a lockdown must-listen thanks to its ability to transport listeners back to a glitzy 80s New York \u2013 especially when the everyday can feel a little lacking in glamour. The illustrious editor Tina Brown talks openly about moving from London to the Big Apple, and the self-proclaimed \u201ccocky\u201d behaviour that led her to edit Vanity Fair. She speaks to Madhulika Sikka about the secrets of making a great magazine (it\u2019s about the mix of high/low culture, clean design and how the package is put together), how Annie Leibovitz came to visually define the magazine and the surprising value of gossip. Priya Elan Available on Stitcher Pikes If you are looking for armchair escapism, or perhaps missing your annual Ibiza excursion, sit back with the new season of the Pikes podcast. The Pikes boutique hotel is an institution that is steeped in rock\u2019n\u2019roll history. Established in the 1970s by the late Tony Pike, who came to epitomise the hedonism of the island, it it became famous in the 80s as the location for Wham!\u2019s Club Tropicana video. Recent episodes include the TV presenter and Love Island host Laura Whitmore chatting about her favourite cocktails \u2013 quarantini inspiration, if ever any were needed \u2013 and Pikes\u2019 creative director, Dawn Hindle, on the hotel\u2019s new Rockovery Retreat wellness programme. Jo Jones Available on Apple The Memory of ... With John Galliano An insight into the mind of one of fashion\u2019s most visionary \u2013 and divisive \u2013 designers, who has remained elusive since his dramatic dismissal from Dior in 2011, following an antisemitic rant. The podcast has become a fascination for many fashion geeks, and, owing to Galliano\u2019s otherwise reclusive nature, developed a cult following. In roughly 10-minute bursts, the designer talks you through his inspirations, as well as the techniques behind his designs; expect plenty of \u201cbias cut\u201d chat, and unexpected insights into the way he translates wild concepts into collections, all delivered in his striking London accent. PB Available on Spotify and Apple Wardrobe Crisis You probably wouldn\u2019t expect a fashion podcast to feature discussions about Australia\u2019s bushfires and the end of capitalism, but that\u2019s what you get from Wardrobe Crisis. Its presenter, the sustainable-fashion expert Clare Press, is suitably cross when talking about climate-crisis villains and extremely enthusiastic about innovative companies and individuals doing great work in the sector. It is in no way escapist, but it does provide hope, giving ideas for the ways we might build a more caring industry after the current crisis.
