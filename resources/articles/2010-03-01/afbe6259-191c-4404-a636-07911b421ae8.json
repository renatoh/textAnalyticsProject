Just. Take a note of the date. The devolution of policing and justice powers has finally been voted for by the assembly. And as far as most of the electorate is concerned, about time. The only party to vote against it are the Ulster Unionists, who argued that the power-sharing executive (or cabinet) is dysfunctional \u2013 and therefore simply not able to cope with those powers at a time when it cannot cope with other matters like education, for instance. That party's view is why on earth should another major matter be dumped on the body politic when it is not ready and able for it. Everybody else, of course, says the Ulster Unionists are just throwing a hissy fit, because this deal on the devolution of justice has been agreed by the Democratic Unionists and Sinn F\u00e9in. Former United States president George W Bush phoned Conservative leader David Cameron last week \u2013 since the Ulster Unionists now have an alliance with the Tories \u2013 to get them to vote yes to policing and justice. Cameron's view seems to be: OK, but I can't tell the unionists how to vote. At the same time, isn't it amazing that this is the subject with which Dubya, absent from politics since his retirement, has chosen to break his silence? President Bush, I always thought, wanted to stay out of the way of Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, unless he was wanted. In the duration of the peace process, he wasn't as essential as Bill Clinton had been. Not uninterested \u2013 just when required. Hillary Clinton has been involved too, phoning other parties. So why is this such a big deal? Here's why: devolution in a post-conflict society \u2013 a real conflict \u2013 is actually watched round the world. The Middle East? Yes. And elsewhere. That's because it has taken years, and years, and years, for this one to resemble one that's about to work. That people who, in their terms, \"fought a war\" can now not just live together but can govern together. Whatever you think of Bill Clinton, here's his contribution: he persuaded unionists that an American influence could be a benign influence \u2013 not simply an Irish-American, and therefore \"united Ireland\" influence. The new American secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has carried that on. Policing and justice powers are being devolved now for lots of reasons. It completes the Northern Ireland political jigsaw. It makes the unblocking of the logjam in devolution much easier. And I won't bore you with all the details \u2013 but my goodness, has there been a logjam. The two biggest parties are the Democratic Unionists and Sinn F\u00e9in. The Unionist party reviled the IRA, and yet is now sharing power with Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 for may unionists, the front men for the IRA. Which leads me on to the electoral point. Many DUP voters are horrified that Martin McGuinness, a former IRA leader, is now Northern Ireland's deputy first minister. Bad enough \u2013 there will be another assembly election in 2012, which might, with Sinn F\u00e9in's electoral might, make McGuinness first minister. But the DUP's worst nightmare is elsewhere \u2013 that a man who was in the DUP twice, and resigned twice, and now has his own party, Traditional Unionist Voice, will split the unionist vote three ways. Jim Allister is his name. And he's massively opposed not just to the devolution of policing and justice but to sharing power with Sinn F\u00e9in in the first place. Might he be the next kingmaker in Northern Ireland? But the devolution of these powers was always inevitable. In two years, nobody will remember it was an issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
