A goal each from Evans himself and Warren Feeney - and a bizarre own goal - helped Nigel Worthington's team go top their group. Asked whether the result had put Northern Ireland back on course for South Africa, Evans said: \"I think it was back on track in the two previous games, we got six points from them. It was a big game and we hope we can do the same again on Wednesday (against Slovenia).\" Feeney was delighted to have played his part too. \"It means a lot to score,\" he said. \"I love playing for my country and I was buzzing, but all the lads from back to front were phenomenal. We are happy with the result and I think we deserved it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
