The Hell's Kitchen star is partnering La Stampa's owner, Louis Murray. Novelli left Auberge, which is based in Hertfordshire's Brocket Hall, and its sister restaurant Novelli in the City, in the London Capital Club, last week, saying that the parties had failed to reach a \"mutually agreeable decision\" over a new contract. The management at Brocket Hall, however, said they had decided not to renew the Frenchman's contract because \"he was hardly ever there\". Novelli had said he had no plans to open a new restaurant \"due to the sudden nature of events\". A good few weeks for David Cameron, the new favourite to become the leader of the Conservative party, who is set to receive the final instalment of a \u00a325,000 windfall. Cameron is expected to sell his \u00a310,750 stake in the bar operator Urbium, where he was a director, on Tuesday when the company is formally taken over. He acquired the shares for \u00a33,375 in June 2003 and has also been paid \u00a315,000 for his work since June during the takeover process, a spell when he was busy establishing his leadership credentials. \"During that period there was a significantly harder workload for all the non-executive directors,\" said a spokesman for the company. Urbium has been acquired by finance group Electra for \u00a3113m, a deal which means Cameron is no longer required in his \u00a328,000-a-year board role. The job had left him open to criticism, particularly regarding the binge drinking debate. Infinity Broadcasting is thought to be close to announcing that David Lee Roth is taking over from shock jock Howard Stern, who is leaving the station at the end of the year. The one-time lead singer of Van Halen will replace Stern in New York, Fox News reports. Adam Carolla, the former co-host of The Man Show, will also be in an eclectic line-up, probably broadcasting to the west coast. Infinity has promised to divide Stern's territories between different hosts because the station believes no single person can replace him. The four original members of rock band REM reunited on Saturday to perform at the wedding of one of their roadies. The performance marks only the second time Michael Stipe, Peter Buck and Mike Mills have performed with drummer Bill Berry since he left the band in 1997. The quartet played seven songs at Kingpins Bowl and Brew in Athens, Georgia, at technician Dewitt Burton's wedding. simon.goodley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
