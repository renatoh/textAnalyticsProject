A good, challenging task will allow able students not only to answer that question, but also to find others. The coursework element is really useful in that everything doesn't rest on the crunch days of the exams. Of course, I am aware that it is open to abuse, but I think the majority of pupils do the work themselves and what many don't realise is that the ones who cheat are the easiest to spot. You suddenly see expressions that aren't their own and that you haven't taught in class; though I suppose former students might be reading this and thinking, \"He didn't catch me!\" But I still think correctly applied tasks that require thinking outside the basic limits of the classroom are enormously useful in every subject. Jo Bexley Parent, London I can see where the idea of coursework comes from, as an alternative way of monitoring progress. All those of us who did that \"cram and exam\" thing promptly forgot what we'd learned, so there's value in project-based work. It teaches broader skills, too, in terms of research and project management, and it's particularly useful for pupils who collapse in exam-room conditions. But it's not a level playing field when it comes to access to information or to the internet, and some kids might get more help from their parents than others. At least with exams, everyone, in theory, has the same chance. Also, there should be an element of recall for subjects such as maths, which depend on logic or ability to remember formulas; even for language, where your success is more readily judged on your ability to apply it rather than sitting and copying out of a book. Jason Ham Aged 17, Somerset I think the point of coursework is being independent, doing your own research, working to deadlines, using IT skills and accessing resources. Some people who struggle with exams can boost their marks with coursework. Perhaps some percentage of coursework could be done under supervised conditions, but it's important to go out and find your own resources. I don't think it's right to divide subjects into those with coursework and those without. People might choose an option just because it was a subject with a coursework element."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
