The US president was asked during an event at the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London on Tuesday about the Queen\u2019s son having stepped down from royal duties after his disastrous BBC interview about the allegations. \u201cI don\u2019t know Prince Andrew, but that\u2019s a tough story, it\u2019s a very tough story,\u201d he answered. In reality, he has met the prince on numerous occasions. The two have been pictured together at various events, including a party at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort on 12 February 2000, at which Trump was also separately pictured with Epstein. The president has referred to the convicted sex offender, who took his own life in jail in August, as a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and \u201ca lot of fun to be with\u201d. Trump has himself denied numerous accusations of sexual abuse by different women. Lawyers for five women who have accused Epstein of abusing them have called upon Andrew to give evidence about what he knows, saying he could have important information about trafficking for sexual abuse. The prince has consistently and categorically denied the allegations, which Buckingham Palace said were \u201cfalse and without foundation\u201d. He has said he regrets maintaining relations with Epstein after his conviction for sexual offences. One of Epstein\u2019s victims, Virginia Giuffre, alleges that she was trafficked to have sex with Andrew on three occasions between 2001 and 2002, on the instructions of Ghislaine Maxwell, a socialite and friend of both Epstein and the prince. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme that was broadcast on Monday, Giuffre said: \u201cThis is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked. This is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guy\u2019s royalty.\u201d Giuffre said it was a \u201cwicked\u201d and \u201cscary\u201d time in her life. \u201cI had just been abused by a member of the royal family.\u201d She added: \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it from royalty. I didn\u2019t expect it from someone that people look up to and admire in the royal family \u2026 I couldn\u2019t comprehend how the highest levels of the government, powerful people, were allowing this to happen, not only allowing it to happen but participating in it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
