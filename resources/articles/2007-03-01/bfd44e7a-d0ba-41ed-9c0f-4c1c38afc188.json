I'm not sure why. I just do. It happened again only the other day, when the trailer for Disney's new animated feature, Meet The Robinsons, turned up on TV. Here is Wilbur Robinson, geeky orphan boy-genius inventor, who is whisked off to the future to be semi-adopted by a family as inventive as himself. Typical Disney stuff but all of a sudden, there's a tyrannosaurus rex, waving its Happy Families-sized head and useless little baby arms and howling, \"Because I got a big head and li'l arms!\" Now I'm not going to rag on Disney or even on the dino in Meet The Robinsons because, as dinos go, he's a pretty good one. Even I laughed, but only after my habitual dino-phobic tremors had at last subsided. My teacher friends tell me that this last week every kid under eight has been endlessly reciting the same line and then falling over laughing. But that sort of proves my point. Dinosaurs are a waste of everybody's time. I wish we could go back in time and violently dissuade Michael Crichton from ever writing Jurassic Park. Hasn't Crichton done enough damage, what with lending his prestige to the anti-global warming lobby, and writing Disclosure, the only bestseller on sexual harassment of men by women? But the dinosaurs I cannot forgive. They're in every other movie these days, from King Kong to Night At The Museum to next year's - wait for it - Jurassic Park IV. In fact you can judge a movie's quality simply by counting the dinosaurs in it. If the number is less than one, chances are the movie's okay. Children have gone nuts for them. On Halloween I get kids knocking things off shelves and knocking themselves out because they can't see through their big dino headmasks. Statistics also show, dear parent, that a sharpened triceratops toy makes for a very effective slash'n'stab schoolyard shiv. I'm also fed up with having to fight about dinosaurs with the proselytising throwbacks from local Fundamentalist churches who are sometimes fool enough to darken my non-believing door. You get these people onto dinosaurs and they'll spend all day saying there were two of each kind in Noah's Maxi-Sized Ark, that Adam and Eve rode around on their backs, used them as slides and such tripe. They have theme parks dedicated to this sort of crap in your more retrograde southern states, and school textbooks and pseudo-scientific research institutes, none of which I remember existing before Jurassic Park came out. It'll take decades to undo all this damage. I say take Crichton's millions off him and reinvest them in the US department of education. You know how much he'd hate that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
