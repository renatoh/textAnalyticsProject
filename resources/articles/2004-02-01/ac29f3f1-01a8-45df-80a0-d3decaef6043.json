Now all the frustration has prompted exasperated calls for an explanation. It is two years since Berti Vogts was charged with reviving the fortunes of Scottish football and to be paid \u00a3500,000-a-year - a handsome basic salary compared to that collected by his predecessor Craig Brown - to do it. On Wednesday, the German cut a forlorn figure as he shuffled out of Cardiff, the illusion that the Scots had made progress under his stewardship shattered by a Nationwide League striker and a 4-0 hammering. Five days after their rugby union side had gone the same way in the same arena, Robert Earnshaw displayed everything Scotland lack, principally pace and confidence, in dismantling the woeful visitors. But, while the 6,000 travelling supporters were entitled to answers as to why their side can only aspire to mediocrity, all they got were yet more questions. \"What can I do?\" asked Vogts. No one doubts that Scotland lack personnel of sufficient quality to challenge as they once did, but it is the lack of cohesion and clear strategy that baffles. Selections these days smack of desperation. Walsall's Paul Ritchie played his first international match for four years at Cardiff but, instead of benefiting from the relatively steadying influence of Christian Dailly at his side, was paired with Steven Caldwell, a 23-year-old with four league appearances for Newcastle this season. It was only a surprise that it took the Welsh as long as 43 seconds to punish the pair's fragility. Vogts pointed to the absence of Steven Pressley and Lee Wilkie as mitigating circumstances, but that is anything but reassuring. Besides, the Scots were facing a Welsh side hampered by nine withdrawals of their own, including their first-choice strikers John Hartson and Craig Bellamy. The replacements had reduced Rab Douglas to a blubbering wreck by the end, although the Celtic goalkeeper, who has conceded ten in his last two international matches, was left exposed too often by those panicking ahead of him. The coach retains the support of the SFA's chief executive David Taylor and received this timely public backing from his captain. \"Every player has faith in the manager,\" said Dailly. \"This is a long-term thing for all of us, but I still think we'll be fine come the World Cup qualifiers.\" That daunting programme will see fixtures against Italy, Norway and Slovenia. There has been only one friendly victory in Vogts's 12 games in charge. His record in competitive matches, five wins in 10, is more encouraging, though it should never be forgotten that the Scots' qualifying group for Euro 2004 was abysmal. Romania loom large at the end of next month but at least Scotland will be at home this time. \"I really believe we have progressed,\" added Vogts, whose Scotland were ranked 51st in Fifa's world rankings when he took over in February 2002 and some two infuriating years on are ranked 53rd. Progress? What progress?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
