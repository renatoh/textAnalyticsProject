The net tightened again last week when it emerged a grand jury had issued a broad subpoena for documents relating to Giuliani\u2019s international consulting business as part of an investigation of alleged crimes including money laundering, wire fraud, campaign finance violations, making false statements, obstruction of justice, and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. \u201cWe who admired him for so long expected much more from Rudy Giuliani and his legacy,\u201d Ken Frydman, a former Giuliani press secretary, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece last month. \u201c\u2018America\u2019s Mayor,\u2019 as Rudy was called after September 11, is today President Trump\u2019s bumbling personal lawyer and henchman, his apologist and defender of the indefensible.\u201d Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and scoffed at the notion he is in any legal jeopardy \u2013 particularly from federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York, an office he once led as a star US attorney during Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term. There Giuliani built a reputation for taking on mob bosses and aggressively prosecuting the kind of criminal activity he now stands accused of. \u201cMe ending up in jail?\u201d Giuliani told the celebrity gossip site TMZ at a Washington airport on Monday. \u201cFifty years of being a lawyer, 50 years of ethical, dedicated practice of the law, probably have prosecuted more criminals of a high level than any US attorney in history. I think I follow the law very carefully. I think the people pursuing me are desperate, sad, angry, disappointing liars. They\u2019re hurting their country. And I\u2019m ashamed of them.\u201d But in no version of events does Giuliani appear not to be in big trouble. The immediate source of his current problems is the work he did in Ukraine over the last two years for himself and on behalf of Trump, who instructed the Ukrainian president to speak to Giuliani in a 25 July phone call. Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s chief political rival, according to US officials who testified in the impeachment hearings. In pursuit of his errand, Giuliani contacted current and former Ukrainian prosecutors, multiple Ukrainian presidential administrations and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs, according to testimony. Prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani offered the oligarchs help with their problems with the US justice department in exchange for help with his project to harm Biden, a charge Giuliani has denied. Two Soviet Union-born American associates of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last month on campaign finance charges, and Parnas is cooperating with investigators. Alongside the prosecutors in New York, the US justice department in Washington is also investigating Giuliani\u2019s conduct, as is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Congress is also after Giuliani, who came in for sharp public criticism in the impeachment hearings earlier this month, when Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch described a smear campaign Giuliani had mounted against her, allegedly because as an anti-corruption advocate she stood in the way of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scheme. \u201cI do not understand Mr Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cWhat I can say is that Mr Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d As the pressure on him has intensified, Giuliani\u2019s antics in his own defense have grown increasingly animated. He warned last week that he had collected information that would put his political enemies on their heels. \u201cI\u2019m also going to bring out a pay-for-play scheme in the Obama administration that will be devastating to the Democrat party,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News. He even threatened to start an impeachment podcast. But what matters most for Giuliani right now is his long friendship with Trump, his most powerful protector, which goes back to the late 1980s, when Trump served as co-chair of Giuliani\u2019s first fundraiser for his 1989 mayoral campaign, according to Wayne Barrett, who has written books about both men. In a telephone interview with the Guardian, in response to a question about whether he was nervous that Trump might \u201cthrow him under a bus\u201d in the impeachment crisis, Giuliani said: \u201cI\u2019m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, who was also on the call, then interjected: \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d \u201cWe are friends for 29 years and nothing will interfere with that,\u201d Giuliani told TMZ of Trump. \u201cThe president knows that everything I did, I did to help him. And he knows it. I did it honorably. I did it legally. I did it in a way that it will embarrass the people who are pursuing me and have nowhere near the integrity and honor that I have.\u201d Trump has tweeted that Giuliani \u201cmay seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer\u201d. In an interview with disgraced former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly last Tuesday, however, Trump distanced himself from Giuliani. Analysts watching Giuliani\u2019s case expect that an indictment could be handed down at any moment, raising the prospect of America\u2019s Mayor in handcuffs. \u201cIf Rudy\u2019s story ends the way it feels like it\u2019s going to end,\u201d wrote Evan Mandery, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and veteran of New York City political campaigns, \u201cit\u2019s not plausible for anyone who knows or has studied him to say they never saw it coming.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
