There is no such thing as a single recordable set of climatic conditions, or a graduated scale on which things become less pleasant as the temperature drops: only a series of infinitely varied and unpredictable sensations. We can turn each day's weather into numbers, but the data is no closer to reality than a composer's printed score to a live musical performance. The former contains the information; the latter shapes our actual experience. We know \u2013 because the excellent forecasters at the Met Office have been measuring for us \u2013 that November has ended with an extraordinary cold blast; that the snow lies 30cm deep and more along the east of the country; that it may keep snowing for several days to come. But this raw information does not begin to capture the curious effect of weather on the human spirit. When storytellers begin, they often describe climatic conditions because they know the emotional potency of weather. Setting the scene for Under The Greenwood Tree, Thomas Hardy, having described the particular noise the winter wind makes in different kinds of tree, writes: \"On a cold and starry Christmas Eve within living memory a man was passing up a lane towards Mellstock Cross.\" He divides the main body of his novel into four parts: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. Weather can make us feel bleak beyond belief on a grey winter's afternoon, damp and cold \u2013 though it might be 10C above freezing \u2013 and yet it can become brisk and thrilling when there is snow on the ground and the ice isn't even beginning to melt. In Derbyshire, where I am writing, it was at least -9C at 8am and it is still well below freezing now. Saturday night was the second coldest on recent record, according to an enthusiastic website that tracks the weather in nearby Buxton. Yet there is nothing harsh about the weather here today. Still and bright, the sun almost warm, it is soft outside: more benign than a mad March a dozen degrees warmer. Even just after dawn, when the metal of a five-bar gate was sticky with frost and ice crystals stood in sharp rows on the stone walls, this was already a joyous day; the light exploding from the snow, trees red with the rising sun, every sound carried on the air. The White Peak landscape is living up, for once, to its title. In the east Midlands we have missed out on the deepest snowfalls and the lowest temperatures \u2013 you cannot, sadly, go sledding on the country lanes as people did last winter, though they are icy enough for cars to slide into each other like slow speed toboggans, as our old Land Rover did this morning, gliding along the flat before locking bumpers with a neighbour's vehicle. In other weather, an accident like that would be infuriating. But both drivers got out and grinned. In snow things are different. It can make us carefree, and then very serious. Nothing is quite as it usually is, or within our control. Perhaps it's simply the novelty. If Britain were like Sweden, where it snows all the time, we might stop noticing the white stuff, and equip ourselves properly to deal with the problems it causes. We'd put chains and studded tyres on our cars. Or perhaps it's just a trick of the light. There's a scientific reason for snow's attraction: the odd fact that it is white when the water that creates it is (like solid ice) transparent. Billions of ice crystals sit at every angle and bounce light around until reflecting it back out. Every part of the colour spectrum is treated the same way, and that evenhandedness means all we see is shiny, pure white. All, at least, until the snow gets dirty and begins to melt and elation slides towards depression. Wise people at the Met Office \u2013 which last week issued new data suggesting the planet is warming at an even faster rather than had been feared \u2013 are right to remind us not to confuse weather with climate. One snowy winter in Britain, or even three, does not mean proper hard winters are back. In Scotland this year skiers ran a tow rope in June \u2013 but over time, in Britain, there is less snow. Not long ago a nearby Derbyshire village had its own ski club (by curious chance Tenzing Norgay, who climbed Everest, learned to ski at it). Now no one here expects more than a few days of whiteness each year. Today was one of them. It was magnificent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
