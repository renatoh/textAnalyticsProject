The fearless video journalist might do so for the Ruptly TV news agency. \u201cNews rarely happens in nice quiet places. You should be ready, willing and able to cover riots, wars, earthquakes, floods, etc,\u201d its ad says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be dangerous. Last six months alone we had two people who should thank their flak jackets for saving their lives.\u201d Wanted, go-getters. Not wanted: \u201cWhiners of all sorts who think that stake-outs are too long, body armour is too heavy and riots are too dangerous.\u201d But might anyone suppose that working for part of Putin\u2019s Russia Today propaganda outfit could ever be anything but difficult? \u2022 Wasn\u2019t our \u201ceffing\u201d Tory prime minister at his most persuasive in Scotland? But then the whole party is on a charm offensive these days. Just recently Grant Shapps sent letters to ordinary sorts, looking to cadge \u00a320 with the promise that each donor will receive a limited edition party mug. Labour has the trade unions, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re donating a staggering \u00a31,000 an hour to try and make Ed Miliband prime minister. If we\u2019re going to stop them, everyone needs to play their part. Because unlike Labour, our campaign is funded by individuals like you.\u201d But that\u2019s not the entire picture, is it? Alongside those who donate \u00a320, there is David Ross, the Carphone Warehouse co-founder, who is estimated to have given hundreds of thousands of pounds. And Michael Farmer, the financier and party co-treasurer, who gave \u00a3333,500 in the second quarter of this year. And Lord Harris of Peckham, said to have coughed up a cool \u00a33m. If \u00a320 yields a mug, \u00a33m must deserve a tea-set. \u2022 A stressful life, hard at the bottom, hard in its way at the top. Take millionaire property tycoon Paddy McKillen. Three years ago he was plunged into battle with the Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph and the Ritz, who would love to add Claridge\u2019s, the Connaught and the Berkeley to their portfolio. Trouble is, McKillen owns them with a one-third stake, and he hasn\u2019t much time for the Barclays. They in turn, persist. Little wonder, then, that U2\u2019s Bono and guitarist The Edge, who co-own with McKillen the Clarence Hotel in Dublin, have sought to cheer him up. In the sleeve notes of U2\u2019s latest opus, Songs of Innocence, McKillen is commended for \u201cgrace under fire\u201d. \u2022 The Duke of Marlborough, meanwhile, will need all his ancestor\u2019s skills to fight the new Battle of Blenheim. He wants to super-size his home town \u2013 Woodstock in north Oxfordshire \u2013 by building 1,500 houses. But the duke and his fellow developer have a fierce opponent, for Peter Jay \u2013 former ambassador to Washington, former aide to Robert Maxwell, former BBC economics editor, and formerly known as \u201cthe cleverest young man in England\u201d \u2013 is irate. In the Oxford Times, Jay also rails against permission granted granted in future in return for promises of community gain. That would amount to the \u201cbuying of the council itself\u201d. Strong stuff. Blenheim could yet see more blood spilled. \u2022 After an eight-month trial at the Old Bailey, normality returns for Rebekah and Charlie Brooks. And they have places aplenty in which to celebrate their freedom. Kingham has become a foodie destination with both local pubs \u2013 the Wild Rabbit Inn and the Kingham Plough \u2013 making it to the top of the latest national Good Food Guide. Not bad for a village of just 900, including Mr and Mrs Brooks and Blur guitarist turned organic farmer Alex James. PM Dave and Jeremy Clarkson live nearby. The Oxfordshire set may be troubled at times, but they never go hungry. \u2022 Finally, though there have been remedies for the seven-year itch, none has proved completely satisfactory. It is now seven years since your diarist came to post, offering news and miscellany, interacting with our fine, knowledgeable, funny army of readers. It\u2019s been a glorious responsibility, but it\u2019s time to shoulder another. Our diary will also take a rest. In its place from next week, the world seen through different eyes in a new column. A change is as good as a rest. Generous as ever, we offer both. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
