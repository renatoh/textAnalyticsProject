Until now. No indication on what's improved since the beta (of course nobody was meant to see that..) though the warnings do say Google Earth is a broadband, 3D application that not all computers can run. Desktop computers older than 4 years old may not be able to run it.Notebook computers older than 2 years old may not be able to run it. Which is vague enough, yes? Here's Google Earth for Mac OSX. Then, if you're in the mood to worry, download the Avian Flu map (created by Declan Butler, a reporter for the science journal Nature). I'm not sure he's got the latest cases in Turkey there, but it's scary even without those."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
