In the first, Meet the Wife , its narrator, an overweight, time-serving journalist called Pumpkin, is on his way to conduct a crucial exclusive interview with the elderly dictator of an eastern Mediterranean country on his yacht, when news comes that the great leader has died. The interviewee, referred to only as \"the Marshal\", is obviously Tito, and the year is 1980, when his death precipitated the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The second novella, The Naked and the Dead, is set in present-day San Francisco, and the narrator is a wildlife photographer, whose wife, a child psychologist, has recently died of cancer. On the face of, it they appear to be discrete narratives about public events and private grief, separated by thousands of miles. But it gradually dawns on us that they are linked by the illusions, delusions, allusions and fantasies of their protagonists; in their minds, legends, dreams and imaginative ruminations extend and compete with daily reality. In Meet the Wife, the troubled Pumpkin turns for help to an ageing seafarer and his son he meets on the Adriatic coast and, with three fellow hacks, embarks on a voyage that will take them away from the burgeoning civil war on the mainland. The ship is the dead Marshal's yacht, and their nautical saviours turn out to be Odysseus and his son Telemachus, eternally at sea. They touch base with familiar Homeric characters before ending up in the company of Circe, who turns Pumpkin, the other journalists and Telemachus's girlfriend into rutting pigs. The sex scenes are coarsely earthy, presumably by intention, and precede the liberation of Pumpkin to accompany Odysseus to Hades. There the former meets his dead wife, Penelope, and the latter conducts, posthumously, the interview with the deceased Marshal that might restore his professional reputation. Pumpkin's adventures take place in a fantasy world where he, like everyone and everything, has the name of a plant or vegetable - the port of Endive, the Hotel Aubergine, the journalists Gumbo, Chickpea and Haricot. By contrast, The Naked and the Dead is set in a very real California, and while by some way the better of the two tales, it has been set up by, and benefits from following Meet the Wife. In this well-realised topographical context, classical illusions proliferate. The narrator David's father worships his fellow Jew, the engineer Joseph Strauss, who built the Golden Gate Bridge, which is compared to the Colossus of Rhodes. David's uncle was killed during the bridge's construction in the 1930s, when a safety device failed to save the lives of 11 workmen - \"Neptune's trident ripped the invisible net apart\". The narrator has followed his father and become a photographer and recorder of the changing state. He has also inherited a love of western movies, seeing them as the essential mythology of America. In fact David meets his wife, Alma Perera, a child psychologist of possible Sephardic Jewish origins, at a screening of John Ford's The Searchers, which is, as film buffs know, The Odyssey transposed to 19th-century Texas. As a teenager, David met Hugh O'Brian, the actor who enjoyed brief fame as TV's Wyatt Earp; his wife had a brief encounter with their favourite star John Wayne, who actually met Earp in the 1920s. When Alma dies painfully of cancer, her husband cannot get out of his mind her possible adultery, and becomes obsessed with a saucy photograph of her, or her doppelg\u00e4nger, curiously dated 1914. His investigations of her past take him along ingeniously charted paths into legends of the west and of the ancient world. His wife, its transpires, was probably the great-granddaughter of the headstrong Josie Marcus, born in Brooklyn to Jewish immigrants. Because of her involvement with both factions at the time of the gunfight at the OK Corral, she was known, apparently, as \"Tombstone's Helen of Troy\" and subsequently married Wyatt Earp. The manager of the Bay Area's last surviving Camera Obscura, the perfect perch for a god-like view of the world, reveals himself to be Pluto, god of the underworld (whose dog is named after him and not Mickey Mouse's dim best friend). Pluto has been intervening in Californian history since the gold rush and arranges for the narrator to enter Hades - in the manner of Orpheus - via an abandoned Nevada mine shaft for a final meeting with his wife. He bribes Cerberus with an expensive pair of Timberland shoes, and inevitably, he also encounters Marshal Earp in the underworld, just as Pumpkin in Meet the Wife meets Marshal Tito. The perfect symmetry of the narrative is matched by the perfect cemetery in San Francisco where Earp, Josie, Joseph Strauss and the narrator's family are buried among the city's Jewish community in the Hills of Eternity Memorial Park. The two stories make a funny, curiously touching book, and Sinclair, as usual, has a nice way with words - a restaurant, for instance, serves a meal where \"the lamb was laid out like a winning game of cards\". He brings to the second tale the knowing love of westerns he brought to Cosmetic Effects, his hilarious 1989 novel about the making of an Israeli western called The Six Pointed Star. He evokes that apocryphal film here in the narrator's \"pleasant daydream\" of the Earp brothers being Hasidic Jews and Wyatt patrolling Tombstone sporting \"a shining star of David\" instead of a marshal's badge. The only trick Sinclair seems to have missed is that Kirk Douglas, son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, starred as both Ulysses and Doc Holliday. \u00b7 Philip French is film critic of the Observer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
