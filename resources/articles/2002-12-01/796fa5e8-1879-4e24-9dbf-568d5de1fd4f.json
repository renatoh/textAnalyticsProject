A joint report published today by Deloitte &amp; Touche and Barclays Private Equity paints a deeply gloomy picture and suggests things are unlikely to improve in the short term. Last year the number of successful exits by venture capital firms (via flotations or trade sales) fell to their lowest level since 1995. The imbalance has had a profound effect on valuations. The research found that since 1996 total exit value has fallen significantly short of new deal value. Tom Lamb, Barclays Private Equity managing director, said: 'As market conditions toughen, the pool of opportunistic buyers dries up. As a result you risk getting an average price for a good business and no price at all for an average business.' The research found that, while a venture capital firm will normally expect to hold on to its investment for between three and five years, less than a quarter of three and four-year-old deals and only a quarter of five-year-old deals have exited. According to research over the last two decades, in 2001 the average lifespan of an investment was more than five years, compared with just three years in 1982. Trade sales have been particularly affected by the downturn and are at their lowest since 1992, having declined from a high of 137 deals in 2000 to just 60 this year. With venture capital firms finding it difficult to exit through either of the traditional routes of flotations or trade sales, many are now selling investments to each other via secondary buy-outs. So far this year there have been 50 such deals compared with 36 last year. Chris Ward, head of corporate finance at Deloitte &amp; Touche, said: 'Venture capitalists are realising it may be better to crystallise a gain now and have a \"score on the board\".'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
