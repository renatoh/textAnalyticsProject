Leaked documents show that civil servants implementing the Family Programme, a government scheme to turn around the lives of 117,000 households, suggested that Harrison's appointment should be checked by the cabinet's propriety and ethics team. Harrison stood down last week after disclosures that her welfare to work company A4e is at the centre of one fraud inquiry and one of A4e's subcontractors is subject to another. Calls have been made for a full disclosure from the government over which ministers were aware of fraud allegations against A4e when Harrison was given the government post. David Cameron's judgment in appointing Harrison has been questioned. It emerged on Monday that A4e had told the department about suspected fraud inside the company in November 2010 \u2013 at least 10 days before Cameron named her as his unpaid adviser for troubled families. The leaked paper, entitled The Family Programme, was circulated in the department in 2010, weeks before Harrison took up her post. In it, civil servants outline proposals to employ two \"national champions\" of the government's policy on problem families. \"It may be that no one person combines these skills and we may therefore wish to have two national champions. We propose Sir Terry Leahy and/or Emma Harrison,\" it states. The document goes on to urge ministers to make a rapid decision before adding: \"Add in advice from Propriety and Ethics/DWP of best way to approach Emma's involvement\". Notably, officials did not suggest that Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, should also be checked. Leahy did not take up a post. The propriety and ethics team provides advice to ensure standards of propriety, integrity and governance within government, according to the cabinet office's website. Liam Byrne, the shadow minister for the cabinet office, said that the document calls into question the government's claims that Cameron did not know about fraud allegations that have engulfed A4e. \"David Cameron says he knew nothing about fraud allegations at A4e when he appointed Emma Harrison, but this document appears to show that senior officials at the heart of government were urging that propriety and ethics checks be made before she was appointed. \"David Cameron must now come clean and say once and for all when he first learned of the fraud allegations, why he was kept in the dark in December 2010 and what action he took when he eventually found out about it,\" he said. A spokeswoman for the department for work and pensions did not respond to a request for a comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
