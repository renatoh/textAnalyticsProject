For most of her life she was happy and successful, and showed great potential. I cannot say why Andrea took her life, any more than the coroner could at the end of a thorough inquest. But Andrea was never abandoned by those working with her. Andrea and her brothers grew up in care; they were in a single foster placement for more than a decade, and they had the same social worker for eight of these years. At 16, Andrea moved to another foster home; her brothers stayed where they were. A wide range of support was available to her, some of which she used; some she chose not to. When older, she was offered a choice of accommodation; she chose her flat partly because it was in the same block as her grandfather. The article said that, when Andrea jumped to her death, the police who had visited her were walking away, which is a simplistic and callous way to summarise officers' involvement and in no way addresses the level of effort made to assist Andrea. It failed to say that her support worker was still with her in her flat, but was unable to stop her. Andrea was a very troubled young woman in the last months of her life and had been unable to live with her birth family for most her life. She committed suicide despite a massive amount of help and support from many people, not as a result of being abandoned by any agency or individual. Those who cared for and worked with Andrea still miss her dearly. Andrew Webb Director, children &amp; young people's directorate, Stockport council \u2022 The tragic account of Andrea Adams' life and death is one example of the extreme difficulties faced by many care leavers, and the propensity of local authorities to side-step their duty to support these young people. The Children Act 1989 gives legal rights to young people leaving care, and is designed to ensure that they have a smooth, supported transition into adulthood. However, these rights cannot be adequately protected unless local authorities properly understand their obligations and provide adequate resources to meet them. It is unlawful for authorities to have a blanket policy refusing to allow individuals to remain in their existing placements once they reach 18, or to fail to have a detailed plan for their support until the age of 21. Unfortunately, the failings highlighted in this article are far from unusual. Education is needed so that children, lawyers and charities become familiar enough with the legislation to be able to enforce the rights. Andrea Adams was not let down by the system, but by a failure to implement the system properly. Local authorities must comply with their legal duties to ensure other young people are given the support they need to avoid the isolation and vulnerability that led to her death. Dr Kathryn Hollingsworth King's College London, Ian Wise QC, Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Stephen Broach, Doughty Street chambers, Oliver Studdert, solicitor, Maxwell Gillott, Carolyne Willow, Children's Rights Alliance, Frances Crook, Howard League for Penal Reform \u2022 The tragic death of Andrea Adams received a thorough examination in public because there was a properly conducted inquest that examined multi-agency failings. Our fear is that there are many more such cases that go unnoticed and are not properly scrutinised. The deaths of vulnerable care leavers in the community raise fundamental concerns about the role of the state as corporate parent. They must not be ignored.
