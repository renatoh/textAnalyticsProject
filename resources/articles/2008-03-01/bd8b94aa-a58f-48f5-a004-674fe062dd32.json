He'd used G-Archiver, a Gmail back-up program, and says: I used Reflector to take a peek at the source code. What I came across was quite shocking. John Terry, the apparent creator, hard coded his username and password to his gmail account in source code. All right, not the smartest thing in the world to do, but then I noticed that every time a user adds their account to the program to back up their data, it sends and email with their username and password to his personal email box! Having just entered my own information I became concerned. Dustin Brooks says he was able to log on to the account and view 1,777 emails with addresses and passwords.... I don't suppose any Tech blog readers have used G-Archiver, but if you have, you should obviously change your password, pronto. Meanwhile, I'm relieved I didn't suggest the program in Ask Jack (use Thunderbird!), and I'm trying to remember if I've used any applications that might have done something similar, without me noticing...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
