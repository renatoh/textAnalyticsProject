Smiths Group's shares rose sharply as it unveiled plans to provide handheld and backpack radiation machines to detect substances that could be used by terrorists. The devices are to be given to police, coastguards, border guards and customs officials as the US attempts to clamp down on the threat of a radioactive attack. A division of the company, Smiths Detection, has carved out a niche in providing equipment to prevent chemical or other attacks but the latest deal moves it into the field of radiation. Smiths would not say how many \"human portable radiation detection systems\" would be made or where they would be deployed but said it represented a \"groundbreaking\" deal. Stephen Phipson, managing director at Smiths Detection, said: \"It has always been our intention to add radiation detection to our existing capabilities against chemical, biological and explosive threats. This programme gives us that capability. \"Our understanding of radiological and nuclear detection science and technology enables us rapidly to innovate solutions to new threat situations,\" he added. The devices have been developed with Symetrica, which began life at Southampton University's department of physics. Smiths Detection, which has offices in Warrington and Watford, already makes a range of equipment to spot explosives, chemicals and arms. In September, it unveiled a \u00a337m deal to provide US airports with detectors that can identify traces of more than 40 substances - including Semtex and drugs - from a swab of a bag. Recently it has trialled detectors on the London Underground, the New York subway and airports in Pakistan and Australia. Smiths also said yesterday that it had signed another deal, worth $7.5m (\u00a33.9m) to develop a smaller handheld radiation detector for emergency workers. Vayl Oxford, director of the US government's domestic nuclear detection office, said: \"Homeland security personnel and 'first responders' will know in real time if they confront a security or safety risk from a device that fits in the palm.\" Smiths employs 32,000 people at 250 bases in 50 countries and also has aerospace and medical divisions. In September it reported a 22% jump in full-year pre-tax profits to \u00a3492m. Smiths shares ended the day up 20p at 946p yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
