Brewster has been eligible to sign professional terms with Liverpool since turning 18 on 1 April but remains on the scholarship deal he agreed when arriving from Chelsea in 2015. Liverpool have so far been unable to convince the teenager to commit to a lucrative deal, despite regular encouragement from manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who considers Brewster a first team option for next season, and fear he may be tempted by a move to Germany. RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund have been linked with the England Under-17 international, who won the Golden Boot in the team\u2019s World Cup triumph in October, but Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach are expected to lead the race for his signature. M\u00f6nchengladbach signed Mandela Egbo from Crystal Palace in 2015 while Jadon Sancho, Reece Oxford and Ademola Lookman have all taken first team opportunities in the Bundesliga recently. Liverpool would only be entitled to a compensation fee set by a tribunal should Brewster leave while on scholarship terms, although Anfield officials are continuing efforts to conclude a deal with his representatives. Klopp, meanwhile, insists Liverpool deserve to qualify for next season\u2019s Champions League given their efforts throughout this campaign. Liverpool have been permanent residents in the top four since 17 December but need a point at home to Brighton to secure qualification for a second successive season. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWe absolutely deserve it, 100%, but we have to make the last step. If we don\u2019t do it and Chelsea get the spot then they deserve it. It is as simple as that. But over the whole season the boys did it in the most difficult circumstances. Chelsea made five or six changes (against Huddersfield) in midweek. That would not be possible for us even if we thought about it. These boys have had to fight for each yard, the last six or seven weeks, pretty much the same group. I really think they deserve it but we have to make the final step ourselves because nobody will probably help us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
