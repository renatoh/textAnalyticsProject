Brings back so many memories! I was prompted to write after you wrote that you wished there was an affordable way to travel around Oz without having to go on tours. A couple of suggestions. In many of the hostels/cyber-cafes, you see ads from people wanting to share the costs of driving. Obviously it's all a bit hit and miss whether you meet someone you actually want to travel with, but it may be worth a try. Another thing you could try is perhaps to get a lift with a haulage company. I managed to get a lift from Perth to Broome in a friend's roadtrain - not exactly the most comfortable journey I've ever undertaken, but defintely a new take on getting from A-B! Anyway, I hope you're still enjoying yourself - it sounds like you are! It's been chucking it down here today. Very miserable weather - do you miss it?! Well, take care and keep on making the most of every day. It all comes to an end far too quickly!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
