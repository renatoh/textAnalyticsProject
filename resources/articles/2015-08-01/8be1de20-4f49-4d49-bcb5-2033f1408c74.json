To see a recap of episode two, click here. After all the Big Bad Wolf allusions, I still worry that the most appropriate fairytale comparison for Witnesses might be The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. It\u2019s getting thinner and more stretched when it ought to be getting deeper and more absorbing. But I\u2019m still in for the duration, not least because each episode\u2019s climax has made the longueurs worthwhile: first, the fun on the funicular, then last week\u2019s night-time prang, and, this week, a cemetery shootout. The case Another Geco show home, another ghoulish set-up, this time with an urn containing Richard Laplace\u2019s ashes standing in for his corpse (good shout, grauniad26). Once again the women in the equation are deemed irrelevant \u2013 I\u2019m going to be charitable here and say this reflects Gorbier\u2019s reprehensible attitude towards women rather than any latent shortcomings in the writing. Also, it now appears there is a third party involved in Gorbier and Greg Serano\u2019s misdemeanours. Laplace, Muse and Weber appear to have been blackmailing some poor soul, meeting at Le Tribal twice a year to collect their payoffs. Paul\u2019s policing methods are proving distasteful, to say the least \u2013 not to mention putting his son in jeopardy. Still, there\u2019s no sign yet that Sandra\u2019s domestic travails are causing her to take her eye off the case, and at least there\u2019s one less bad guy to catch following Serano\u2019s suicide at the cemetary. The odd couple Justin appears to be an imbecile. (\u201cChew pastry\u201d?) But an imbecile capable of the occasional piercing insight, such as reckoning that Gorbier wants to build Paul back up before knocking him down. Nonetheless, my calling him and Sandra a decaffeinated Saga and Martin is looking like a wild overestimation. And while she seemed to shake off the post-prang limp pretty quickly, Sandra\u2019s life isn\u2019t getting any easier. Her partner Eric may still be having a fling on the side, and she\u2019s two weeks pregnant, which, timing-wise, probably isn\u2019t ideal. (Well done Isolde2 and barbapapa, who speculated that Sandra might be pregnant.) The miscarriage naturally explains the business on Paul\u2019s training course, although we have yet to find out who Chlo\u00e9e\u2019s father is. Paul Maisonneuve Unmoved by either Sandra\u2019s accusations or Gorbier\u2019s message (only his son\u2019s disappearance caused that expression of distant amusement to crack), Paul is clearly a nasty piece of work. Hounding Laplace to suicide (at best); blackmailing poor J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gorbier to give up his dad, then blackmailing his dad to turn himself in; and then being arrogant enough to believe that covering up the mic while Gorbier made his incriminating outburst would never be discovered. I think it\u2019s fair to say his brief rapprochement with Sandra is at an end. Nice to know, too, that he \u201csounds Belgian\u201d. Something tells me it\u2019s not meant as a compliment. Other key players Laura: She\u2019s back, doesn\u2019t work at Le Tribal (as I initially thought she did) and is causing strange stirrings in Paul, apparently. Why, when she challenged him, didn\u2019t he just say she reminded him of his wife? Is there another woman, possibly much younger, who has bitten the dust on his watch? J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gorbier: Poor, Lady Gaga-loving Gorbier Jr. I wonder what sort of long-term damage could have been done to the nervous then-eight-year-old by Paul\u2019s desperate, amoral actions. Does he know his dad\u2019s been hiding out in the loft, or did he merely see him in the night and assume that he was some sort of dreamy apparition? Damien: Absent from this episode (although his boss Henri made a brief, inconsequential appearance), I wonder if Damien could be the mystery accomplice? He has Geco connections, so could offer access to the houses, and is friendly with Paul, so probably visited him in rehab, where he could have nicked his lock-up keys. Plus, he\u2019s a bit short on money, so could do with bumping off his creditors \u2026 Laurence Wanderwilt: AKA Eric\u2019s Girl with the Lipstick. The arm around the waist didn\u2019t look great, but it was hardly hard evidence. I can see Sandra getting this one wrong and driving Eric away just when she needs him most. Time of the wolf Another sighting, courtesy of Caroline (who keeps cropping up), this time in the Laplace garden while the urn theft took place. This probably can\u2019t be dismissed as a couple of people seeing things any longer. But who owns a wolf? Thanks, too, to France\u2019s own ZizanieCriarde last week, for noting that \u201cavoir vu le loup\u201d is slang for a girl losing her virginity. There\u2019s sure to be something in that. Thoughts and observations \u201cWhat are you doing to protect our dead?\u201d made me chuckle \u2013 it felt more like a line from Les Revenants. Speaking of which, watch out for Laurent Lucas (Kaz Gorbier) in the upcoming season of our favourite French zombie drama. The identities of those show-home corpses, just for the record: Sylvie Tourneux, 45 and died of a long illness; Melissa Vernet, 16, cause of death unknown. Maxine (still on diligent expositional duty) and Sandra loudly discussing Paul\u2019s loyalties in an open-plan office didn\u2019t feel particularly professional. Presumably there was a message left in the first show home. What was it? If Chez Gorbier is \u201ca family home\u201d, then I\u2019ll stick to my first-floor flat, thanks.
