Using the birth of their first child to focus attention on the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative this week, the couple were met with praise and criticism in equal measure. My perspective comes from both sides of the equation: I\u2019m the co-founder and CEO of a Silicon Valley tech startup, Crowdpac, but was for a number of years senior adviser to British prime minister David Cameron. One of the phrases you hear most in the tech industry is: \u201cWe want to work on big problems.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve done that in government, and I\u2019m now doing it in tech. And I can tell you: the HBO show Silicon Valley hits the nail on the head with its parodic portrayal of every last startup founder and app developer claiming that they\u2019re going to \u201cchange the world\u201d. Increasingly, however, the wealthy founders of successful startups want to \u201cchange the world\u201d not just through their technology, but through personal philanthropy, too. Enter Zuckerberg and Chan, who join a crowded field including Bill Gates, Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt, and Salesforce\u2019s Marc Bennioff. As founder of the poverty-fighting charity Tipping Point, Daniel Lurie is perhaps the top energizer for philanthropy in the San Francisco Bay Area. His take on the Zuckerberg news? \u201cSeeing Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan commit such a large percentage of their wealth at such a young age promotes the urgency of the issues of poverty we see all around us. These problems are simply too big to wait,\u201d he said. Some tech products really do change the world in positive ways. Google (full disclosure: my wife worked there for many years) has contributed spectacularly to the expansion of human knowledge and understanding. Airbnb is enabling previously unimaginable human connections. And increasingly, there are interesting blends of business and philanthropy, such as the Omidyar Network, set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, which invests in non-profits and for-profit organizations that tackle fundamental social and environmental problems. Daniel Lurie\u2019s own T Lab, the R+D arm of Tipping Point, applies the innovation approach of Silicon Valley tech firms to developing new ideas for solving complex challenges like access to early education and helping people coming out of jail. But the tech industry\u2019s \u201cchange the world\u201d mantra is often overblown, or worse, means changing the world in negative ways. And frankly, philanthropy doesn\u2019t do as much good as it could either. Too little of the technology \u2013 or the philanthropy \u2013 addresses the real, underlying causes of social and environmental problems. To do that, you need to get into the complicated, messy and often contentious business of policy and government. Tech people tend to shy away from that; in fact, I\u2019ve noticed a tendency for Silicon Valley types to be totally dismissive of government, only half-joking that if their technology could literally replace government, the world would be a much better place. There\u2019s just the small matter of democratic accountability. When it comes to \u201csolving\u201d problems like poverty or inequality, there are different, contested points of view as there are human factors. It\u2019s not some technical, technocratic thing that a \u201cproduct\u201d can \u201cfix\u201d. Take the issue of personalized learning, one of the focus areas for Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s new foundation. I support his intent: the current factory schools system, cramming facts into children\u2019s heads and subjecting them to endless tests, is a total disaster. I agree we need a more personalized approach, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m one of the founder parents of the Khan Lab School, started last year by Khan Academy creator Sal Khan. But it\u2019s not enough for people like me to support a school like that, or even, in a much bigger way, for Mark Zuckerberg to support any number of innovative schools or resources to back them. The real barrier to change is the school system itself, the whole, top-down, centralized, bureaucratic structure. The tech entrepreneur who best understands how to bring about positive social change may not be in Silicon Valley at all. Michael Bloomberg himself ran for office and applied his business skills to public policy. But more interestingly, he understood the real potential of philanthropy to solve problems and, . as mayor of New York, even put his personal money into policy experiments. So yes, we should welcome the Zuckerberg commitment and not carp about it, but let\u2019s also encourage tech leaders to get more involved in policy, politics and government \u2013 not just lobbying for rules that suit their businesses, but genuinely trying to, er, \u201cchange the world\u201d.
