Frentzen has accepted what is in formula one terms a modest fee from Arrows as he is in the throes of suing the Jordan organisation for \u00a33.4m that he claims is still owing for the balance of his contract with the Irish team when he was dismissed after a lacklustre performance in the British grand prix. His decision to commit to Arrows is being taken as bad news for Alain Prost's team, which gave him drives in the last five races of the 2001 season. Frentzen was quite impressed with the handling of the Prost AP04 and had been holding off committing to Arrows even after the Prost team was put into receivership by a French court last month with debts in excess of \u00a318m. Prost has until January 17 to finalise a rescue bid for his own team, after which it faces the possibility of liquidation despite the fact that it has optimistically lodged an official entry in the 2002 world championship. Frentzen, who has three grand prix victories to his credit in a career that has embraced 129 races since he made his debut with Sauber in Brazil in 1994, is nevertheless clearly wary of committing to Arrows for more than a single season. The team, headed by the former racer Tom Walkinshaw, has yet to take delivery of the new Cosworth V10 engines, similar to those being used by Jaguar, which will replace the Asiatech-badged Peugeot engines in its cars for the coming season. It had originally been intended that Walkinshaw would transfer the ownership of the team's wind tunnel to Jaguar as part payment for the engines. However, sources close to Jaguar hint that the team is having second thoughts about taking over the Arrows facility and instead want Walkinshaw to pay the full \u00a315m lease fees to Cosworth for the use of the engines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
