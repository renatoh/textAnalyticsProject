But then, in Pakistan, they are making the same remarks about Rashid Latif. And in South Africa, one of England's opponents for next month's triangular tournament, Graeme Smith is of similar ilk. There is nothing like failure in the group stages of one World Cup to sharpen the appetite prematurely for the one four years down the line. Vaughan, with 28 Tests and 26 one-day internationals behind him, might be relatively inexperienced as he embarks upon the one-day captaincy but he is shrewd enough not to overstate the importance of planning for the West Indies in 2007. Asked what his priorities were, he responded: \"Win a few matches.\" At this stage, there is little else to it. World Cup planning amounts, at best, to a vague introduction of fresh young talent. That is why today England will place their faith in Vikram Solanki and Chris Read just as after their World Cup failure in England in 1999 they placed their faith in Vikram Solanki and Chris Read. There is every chance that both will again be dispensed with long before the Caribbean comes around. Had it not been for their boycott of their World Cup tie in Harare, it was easy to imagine England as semi-finalists. Nevertheless, World Cups are watersheds and only six players - Vaughan, Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Flintoff, Ashley Giles, James Anderson and Steve Harmison - remain. Vaughan's captaincy is only just beginning, and already he is fielding the same old concerns. Particularly the question about whether the batsman recently acclaimed the best in the world will be undermined by the captaincy. \"I'm aware that Nasser stressed how he had to leave time for his batting,\" he said. \"I know I've got to get my batting right. I don't see any reason to worry because I've had a few failures.\" Of much more concern is the balance of his side. England's World Cup philosophy was a sound one: three powerful middle-order all-rounders, and three specialist fast bowlers from nine to 11. The fast bowlers should remain. For all the Old Trafford square's meek reputation, England will remember their last floodlit international in Manchester, two years ago, when they were blown away for 86 by Australia's pace attack. That suggests that Anderson and Darren Gough will be backed up either by Kabir Ali, who bowled poorly in Saturday's Cardiff warm-up match, but who deserves a fair run, or Steve Harmison. Only this morning will Vaughan be absolutely sure about the bowling fitness of Flintoff and Anthony McGrath. McGrath has not bowled since he strained a side in a sudden three-wicket burst against Zimbabwe and Flintoff has yet to bowl a full spell since recovering from a compressed nerve in his shoulder. \"Can you manage a full 10?\" he was asked. \"Ten what? Hope so,\" he replied. Once upon a time, he might have meant pints or cream cakes, but we must assume that Slimline Freddie meant overs. Vaughan wants Flintoff at No5, believing that he has the potential not just for belligerent late-order 30s against the soft ball but match-winning hundreds. A new captain is entitled to his optimism. The three all-rounders theory, though, is harder to maintain, and much of that is due to Alec Stewart's necessary replacement as one-day wicketkeeper. Read is scheduled to bat at No7, but that seems a place too high. Either Read's batting needs to develop further or a batsman-wicketkeeper needs to emerge. Keep a watchful eye on Durham's Phil Mustard. Rikki Clarke rescued England's innings against Wales from No8, and also won great praise for his fielding, but Vaughan's failure to bowl him revealed his suspicion that his fast-medium remains gauche, and he is not certain to play. As for Pakistan, their captain Rashid Latif listened in English but responded through a translator - the manager, Haroon Rashid. The gist of it was that Pakistan's young side had already won the Sharjah Cup and the pressure was on England. He added that Pakistan's volatile supporters should not repeat their pitch invasions of two years ago. Lancashire have extra police on standby in case they don't heed his words.
