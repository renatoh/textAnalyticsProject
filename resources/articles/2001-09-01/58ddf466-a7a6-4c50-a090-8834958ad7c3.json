Mr Caudwell says he was upset to hear that Singlepoint had angered so many customers. He admitted the company had \"fallen a long way short of the standard of customer care we expect\". He blamed staff \"who must have been poorly trained or become disenchanted\". Not only that but some managers had proved to be \"unsuitable\" and \"set a poor example\". But he rejects criticism from several Singlepoint call centre staff who have written to Jobs &amp; Money claiming the problems experienced by readers were typical and the result of a business culture that encourages aggressive tactics. \"The whole management team here is striving to provide an excellent service,\" he says. \"I don't think the problems we are experiencing are down to an unwillingness to recognise problems. It is down to a degree of incompetence among certain employees and managers and their inability to move the business fast enough to cope with the significant demand.\" He confesses, however, that many of the company's practices need to be reformed. He says the company should be replying to faxes or letters in less than three days after they have been received. An internal investigation has revealed that letters are left on average for over a week before a reply is sent. \"We have slipped to one week and that is unacceptable - we hope to restore a two-day turnaround in the very near future,\" he says. His investigation, conducted since last week's revelation of appalling customer service, has also brought to light a failure in the system that is supposed to escalate complaints up the management chain. At present call centre operators must pass on information, including complaints, using \"bits of paper\". He says in recent months 12 new managers and team leaders have been drafted in to overhaul the process. A system was brought in two years ago to make sure unhappy customers could appeal to a team leader and if that proved fruitless, the call centre manager. Mr Caudwell agrees with readers that this system had been ignored and apologised to all those who had been refused the chance to take their complaint to senior managers. \"Our call centre is not very good at answering calls, and it's something we plan to improve,\" he says. \"But,\" he adds, \"it is not much worse than the industry average. We recieve 400,000 calls a month, which is an astonishing amount. Ninety per cent are answered within 60 seconds and we are trying to bring that down to 20 seconds.\" Mr Caudwell normally allows the managing director of each company to run the businesses and normally he will only attend monthly management meetings. But in the past six months he has been more hands- as Singlepoint attempts to move offices and introduce more sophisticated customer relations. Much of the work is being carried out by business consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) as part of a \u00a399m investment. If readers letters are anything to go by, he appears to have his eye on the activities of PwC rather than his current operation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
