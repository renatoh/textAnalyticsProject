After Alan Pardew\u2019s interim successor was booed by a minority of travelling supporters at the end of the recent 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace, Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director, publicly urged everyone on Tyneside to get behind Carver. \u201cLet\u2019s not think this is a massive issue, because it\u2019s not,\u201d said Carver, who takes an injury-ravaged squad featuring only four fit senior defenders to Manchester City on Saturday. \u201cThe reaction of the majority of people I\u2019ve met on the street has been really positive towards me, but it\u2019s a different vibe on social media.\u201d As a Newcastle fan, Carver, who is gradually making the team more attacking while tightening certain aspects of their defence, understands the desire to criticise. \u201cIf I was in the stands I\u2019d be having a go about the same issues at times,\u201d he said. \u201cOur fans are very knowledgeable people. I genuinely mean that. I think we are fortunate in the north-east to have very knowledgeable fans here and at Sunderland. They love the game. So when people start having a go I can half understand that. Let\u2019s not make them out to be bad fans because they\u2019re not \u2013 but [criticism] takes away from the importance of supporting the team.\u201d Having served as Alan Pardew\u2019s No2 for four years, Carver became accustomed to his predecessor weathering sometimes sustained abuse from fans. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people out there who\u2019ll have a go at you and you\u2019ve got to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the important thing is making sure there\u2019s a relationship between me and the fans. I think\u2019s it\u2019s important and I\u2019m trying to create that. It\u2019s important people understand I only want the best for this club. \u201cI got that minority reaction at Crystal Palace because I took off a forward for a defender \u2013 but I had to do it. If I explain that to people they might start to understand it. I was trying to get a point from the game rather than lose all three. Every point we get is crucial.\u201c Carver recently canvassed tactical opinion from a group of junior schoolboys at his local golf club. \u201cI sat with nine, 10, 11-year-old kids for 15 minutes talking about the team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite funny. I asked one kid to write his side down in formation on a piece of paper. He had two defenders in a 2-6-2. I told him we would do that against Manchester City.\u201d The former Toronto manager feels social media distorts the consensus while also lacking context. \u201cIt gives someone a voice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might have a 15-year-old kid who has an opinion, puts it out on social media, it starts a discussion and, all of a sudden this lad, this Joe Bloggs, gets a bit of an ego.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
