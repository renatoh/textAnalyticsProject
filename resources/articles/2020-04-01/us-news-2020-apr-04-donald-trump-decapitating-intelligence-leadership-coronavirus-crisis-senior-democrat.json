News of the firing of Michael Atkinson came as the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in the US passed 7,000 and the White House faced continuing criticism for its handling of the response. Trump raged about Atkinson at Saturday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, claiming someone should \u201csue the ass off\u201d the whistleblower whose complaint Atkinson relayed to Congress, per his constitutional duty. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, told MSNBC. \u201cAnd of course it sends a message throughout the federal government and in particular to other inspectors general that if they do their job as this professional did, and Michael Atkinson was a complete professional, they too may be fired by a vindictive president.\u201d Atkinson, a Trump appointee, determined that the whistleblower\u2019s report was credible in alleging Trump abused his office by attempting to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals. According to a justice department legal opinion, Atkinson expressed concern that Trump potentially exposed himself to \u201cserious national security and counter-intelligence risks\u201d when he pressed Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son during a call on 25 July last year. Late on Friday, Trump said in a letter to Congress that Atkinson no longer had his \u201cfullest confidence\u201d and would be removed in 30 days\u2019 time. \u201cHe\u2019s settling scores,\u201d Schiff said of Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of this pandemic and thousands of people are dying and he is retaliating against people who are on his enemies list and doing it in the dead of night.\u201d On Saturday morning, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called Atkinson\u2019s firing \u201ca brazen act against a patriotic public servant who has honorably performed his duty\u201d. \u201cThis latest act of reprisal against the intelligence community threatens to have a chilling effect against all willing to speak truth to power,\u201d Pelosi said. Whistleblower Aid, a group which supports \u201cindividuals who, lawfully, report government and corporate law breaking\u201d, said Trump was \u201cimplementing a direct assault on critical federal oversight mechanisms implemented in the wake of Watergate\u201d, the 1970s scandal which brought down Richard Nixon. \u201cNow is the time for truth telling,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe lives of Americans depend on whether public servants \u2026 can carry out their duties without interference, fear or retaliation.\u201d At Saturday\u2019s White House coronavirus briefing, Trump was asked about his move against Atkinson. In a rambling and furious answer, the president claimed not to know and never to have met an official he nonetheless insisted did \u201ca terrible job\u201d and was \u201ca disgrace to inspector generals\u201d. \u201cIt was my decision,\u201d to fire Atkinson, the president said, adding: \u201cI have the absolute right to do so.\u201d The whistleblower, supposedly guaranteed anonymity under federal law, has been named by Republican politicians, rightwing media figures and Trump, who retweeted a message in which the official was named. \u201cEveryone knows who the whistleblower is,\u201d Trump said on Saturday, adding: \u201cFrankly someone ought to sue his ass off.\u201d The relaying of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint led to Trump being impeached by the Democratic-held House, where Schiff steered proceedings. But the president was acquitted in February after a trial in the Republican Senate in which Schiff led a team of managers prosecuting the House\u2019s case. Schiff\u2019s remark about Trump \u201cdecapitating\u201d the intelligence community also took in the departure of acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire, who also backed the whistleblower\u2019s action and was controversially replaced by a Trump loyalist, Richard Grenell. The Axios website reported on Saturday that Trump is considering placing Steve Feinberg, a billionaire investor and political ally, in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. In the heated atmosphere of Trump\u2019s Washington, language as forthright as that used by Schiff is common. For example, in January, as the impeachment trial began, CBS News reported that Republican senators had been warned that if they voted against the president, \u201cyour head will be on a pike\u201d. Only one Republican, the Utah senator and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney, voted to convict the president and remove him from office. Elsewhere in Washington on Saturday, the top US federal watchdog promised to continue to conduct \u201caggressive\u201d independent oversight of government agencies. Michael Horowitz, chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and the inspector general at the Department of Justice, said in a statement Atkinson was known for his \u201cintegrity, professionalism, and commitment to the rule of law and independent oversight\u201d. US inspectors general, charged with independent oversight of federal agencies, were recently tasked with broad surveillance of the government response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the historic $2.3tn package to mitigate its economic impact. \u201cThe inspector general community will continue to conduct aggressive, independent oversight of the agencies that we oversee,\u201d said Horowitz. \u201cThis includes CIGIE\u2019s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee and its efforts on behalf of American taxpayers, families, businesses, patients and healthcare providers to ensure that over $2tn dollars in emergency federal spending is being used consistently with the law\u2019s mandate.\u201d Democrats have expressed concerns about how the stimulus cash will be doled out. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the treasury department to be able to hand out to their friends,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
