United dithered and dawdled in their savannah away strip and, after a promising start full of impetus, came a horribly beige performance. The numbers speak volumes of their sorry predicament: ambling in mid-table, they remain without back-to-back league wins since Solskj\u00e6r took permanent charge in March, while their tally of 13 points from 11 matches is their lowest at this stage of a top-flight season since 1986-87. This was even more galling for Solskj\u00e6r given it was Joshua King, the Bournemouth striker once a pupil of his in United\u2019s reserves, who inflicted this latest wound. In finishing drills after training, King opened his ears trying to perfect the killer instinct synonymous with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s playing days. For United, any feelgood factor fostered over the past fortnight has quickly diminished. The raw and painful reality is they have tasted victory in the league only once since September and Solskj\u00e6r acknowledged they must improve if they are to give themselves any chance of qualifying for the Champions League. \u201cWe need a response because games like this you need to win if you want to challenge for top four and we\u2019re disappointed,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of character when you come down to places like this; 1-0 down, half-time. In the second half, at least we went for it. We didn\u2019t stop trying but it was the lack of quality that couldn\u2019t give us the point or three. Two more games before the international break \u2013 we\u2019ve got a chance on Thursday to qualify [for the Europa League knockout stage] and then Brighton at home.\u201d On this evidence, United are going nowhere fast and that Solskj\u00e6r is already dissecting their deficiencies in the race for the top four highlights the challenges ahead. By contrast, for Bournemouth this was almost the complete performance; Nathan Ak\u00e9 and Steve Cook were immense in defence, Jefferson Lerma a ubiquitous presence in midfield and King and Callum Wilson pests United simply could not control in attack. Aaron Ramsdale, the England Under-21 goalkeeper who spent last season earning his stripes at AFC Wimbledon, was again unflappable. However, as Solskj\u00e6r conceded, it was King who ultimately made the difference. \u201cHe\u2019s always a threat, he\u2019s strong and when you win the game with a moment of magic like that you say \u2018well done,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s developed into a very good player.\u201d Daniel James pierced holes in Bournemouth\u2019s backline early on, supplying Andreas Pereira and Fred, both of whom ended up aquaplaning on a saturated surface, but it was King\u2019s goal that illuminated an entertaining first half. The striker chested Adam Smith\u2019s dinked cross before juggling the ball away from a statuesque Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who allowed the striker to swivel unchallenged and lash the ball home on the volley. It was an emphatic finish but another instance of powder-puff defending, not long after Wan-Bissaka got away with allowing King to tee up Ryan Fraser to test David de Gea. \u201cI\u2019m sure that will be a special moment for him,\u201d said the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe. \u201cWhen you play against your former clubs, it can have extra meaning. We felt we needed that win for our own confidence and impetus into our season.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r felt the international break reinvigorated his squad but, after going behind here, his side surrendered all tempo and they struggled to hurt the hosts until the substitute Mason Greenwood rattled a post eight minutes from time. A crude challenge on Marcus Rashford aside, the Bournemouth captain Cook \u2013 the first player to make 150 Premier League appearances for the club \u2013 further enhanced his reputation, shepherding the backline brilliantly as a stirred United tried to up the ante. Scott McTominay, in front of the watching Scotland assistant coach, Steven Reid, forced Ramsdale to parry but Bournemouth held on to leapfrog United. \u201cCould\u2019ve, should\u2019ve \u2013 that\u2019s football,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThe front four looked promising but flattered to deceive. It looked like we could create chances but didn\u2019t have the last pass, or the last finish. That\u2019s something we need to improve on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
