Baxter, whose motto should be \u201cnever knowingly undercatered\u201d, is incapable of making a meal with fewer than a dozen courses, and this year was no different, including six antipasti and three pastas, which makes a nonsense of trying to match individual dishes. The trick is to find a wine that will rub along with pretty well everything you throw at it, and I found it in an Etna bianco from Sicilian producer Tasca d\u2019Almerita. Like many Italian whites, it was fresh, crisp, dry and comparatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that wouldn\u2019t stand out in a tasting but that bursts into life with food. That\u2019s true of many Italian whites, even pinot grigio, whose comparative neutrality is a positive bonus as a backdrop to a meal. (It\u2019s interesting that most Italians don\u2019t instinctively reach for an aromatic sauvignon blanc or oaky chardonnay with their meals, although they do make more international styles for the UK market.) Italian reds, too, tend to be lighter and more acidic than their French and Spanish counterparts. I know the term \u201cacid\u201d doesn\u2019t sound particularly appealing, but it\u2019s another word for the freshness in a wine that cuts through food so appealingly. With the exception again of the richer styles you find in the Maremma region of Tuscany, Sicily and the south, these are red wines that behave like a white, which works particularly well with the veg-centred food we tend to be eating these days. Compared with other European wines, they\u2019re good value, too, with plenty available for less than \u00a310, although they may not appeal if you\u2019re a fan of more full-bodied reds such as malbec, say. The downside with Italian wines \u2013 as I touched on last week \u2013 is that they\u2019re not particularly consistent. Pinot grigio can be really good value or it can, frankly, be piss-poor. Go for the top-of-the-range supermarket own-labels such as Tesco Finest* Pinot Grigio at \u00a37, or more expensive pinot grigios when they\u2019re on special offer, such as the Terre di Vita Organic Pinot Grigio 2018 (12.5%), which is normally \u00a37.99 but is currently reduced to \u00a35.99 on Waitrose\u2019s current 25%-off-six-bottles offer. Even if you don\u2019t regard yourself a pinot grigio fan, that\u2019s a really good deal. Four food-friendly Italian wines to see you right through a meal Verdicchio dei Castelli de Jesi Classico 2018 \u00a37 Marks &amp; Spencer, 13%. One of the most reliable and authentic Italian whites. Nicosia Lenza di Munti Etna Bianco 2017 \u00a311 Booths, 12.5%. Very well priced (for Etna), mineral volcanic white. Perfect for seafood. Custoza Monte del Fra 2018 \u00a39.50 Booths, \u00a312.50 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12.5%. Really appealing, smooth, dry white, similar in style to a soave. Cecchi Morellino di Scansano 2018 \u00a37.49 (on offer) Waitrose, 13%. Fresh, fruity, Tuscan red to go with rag\u00f9 or roast lamb. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
