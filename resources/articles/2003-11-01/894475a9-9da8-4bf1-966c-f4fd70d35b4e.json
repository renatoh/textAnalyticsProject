Mrs Hodge said that due to limited resources any attempt to provide universal childcare to pre-school children would come at the expense of providing additional services. Speaking at the annual conference of the Daycare Trust in London, she said: \"In my view it is more important to put what will always be limited resources into funding the creation of new places and subsidising those working parents who most need the subsidy, rather than a blanket subsidy to all parents which will inevitably be at the expense of expansion.\" Mrs Hodge said that by 2006 there would still only be one childcare place for every 11 pre-school children in the areas covered by the Sure Start early years child support programme. \"With that mountain to climb we will need to prioritise,\" said the minister. While supporting in principle universal childcare, she said the needs of children and families in deprived areas must continue to be the government's priority. Mrs Hodge also said that primary and nursery schools will in future provide more childcare and family support services. She said that by offering a range of services that met the full spectrum of children's educational and social needs, schools would be better equipped to help pupils achieve their full potential, including their academic performance. \"The challenge must be to develop many children's services on school sites and in school buildings. That must become a central feature of our childcare strategy over the coming period,\" said Mrs Hodge. \"In no way does this undermine our determination to raise standards in schools. Far from it. By addressing the needs of children in a holistic way, every child will be far better able to realise their individual potential and raise standards even further.\" However, Mrs Hodge's rejection of universal childcare will disappoint campaigners who point out that provision in the UK falls well below the level provided in most other comparable countries. The Daycare Trust yesterday warned that parents face a childcare postcode lottery with too few places and excessive costs because government help is targeted on the poorest areas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
