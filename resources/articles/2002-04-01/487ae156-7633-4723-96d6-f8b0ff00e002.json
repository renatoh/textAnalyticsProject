After three months of exhaustive letter-writing and telephoning to hundreds of regional leagues and county FAs - not to mention the governing bodies of \"rival\" sports - it was announced that football is the most popular participation sport for women. According to the FA's figures, audited internally, 61,667 women and girls play competitive football. That represents an increase of more than 5,000 on last year and an even more substantial rise on the 11,000 players registered at the time the FA took over the running of the women's game in 1993. Not so long ago football was for many girls forbidden territory even in school lunch hours. In the last two years, however, the FA has aimed a series of launches to encourage women and girls into football. First came the announce- ment of its commitment to a professional league, then a telephone hotline for those wanting to play. In September the International Player Development Centre opened in Loughborough and last month Nationwide became the first sponsor in England specifically to buy into the women's game on a national level. Anyone coming to women's football via Bend It Like Beckham might be disappointed to discover that most Premiership sides play in hand-me-down men's kit rather than bra-tops and well-fitting shorts. But the film demonstrates that it has become possible for girls to aspire to professional football. Now, says Gary Mulcahey, director of Fulham's centre of excellence, parents attend open evenings seeking reassurance that their daughters can make a living out of playing. Meanwhile the All-England Netball Association, which until yesterday governed the country's most popular female sport, has seen its affiliation numbers decline to 55,241. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
