Some sports are at short-term risk while other major sports have much bigger budgets. But because they don\u2019t have money coming in from their partners and they are not hosting events they expected some of the big sports could also be under threat. It\u2019s across the board. People\u2019s jobs and the future of sporting bodies are at stake. We just don\u2019t want to see any of the sports going under.\u201d Grainger, the most decorated British female Olympian of all time, is the kind of intelligent and calm leader needed in a crisis. As a rower she won a medal at each of the past five Olympic Games, with her gold at London 2012 being the high point. The 44-year-old is also a six-time world champion who earned a PhD in criminal law. She is as amiable as ever as we talk for more than an hour but, surveying the impact of Covid-19, Grainger does not conceal the severity of the situation. UK Sport is in the midst of obtaining a comprehensive health check on the finances of all its Olympic and Paralympic sports. Key information is still to be collected but the early indications worry Grainger as she concedes some sports are in danger. \u201cIf [the crisis] goes on for another six months there will be a handful of sports, three or four [which could go under]. If no other financial stability was guaranteed it would go up into the teens. We have talked to about 30 sports and I think about half would be in quite serious threat if this went on.\u201d Grainger is understandably reluctant to name the sports in potential jeopardy but says: \u201cWe have started talking to the government and they are sympathetic but as much as we will be fighting for sport to get reassurance [of government help] as early as possible we know there are very big decisions to be made in health, education, industry and the economy. The impact on these areas must be considered first and we\u2019re not saying sport should be ahead of any of these.\u201d Does Grainger envisage a situation where she may have to choose which sporting bodies are kept alive? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will be in that position but there is a chance we will end up there if we can\u2019t get some financial certainty.\u201d The worst effects could well be mitigated by the \u00a3195m Sport England plans to inject into grassroots sport. Grainger also looks up on my laptop screen, as we are doing this interview remotely, and offers a familiar smile of encouragement. \u201cThe Olympics and Paralympics will be next summer as long as this pandemic hasn\u2019t worsened. It would be an incredible opportunity for fit and healthy nations to come together again. We could have quite a celebration if the world\u2019s in a better place. \u201cJust think how it would feel if we could all come together again, watching something together, united in actual physical contact. With that in mind you feel Great Britain would want our teams to be as best prepared as possible but everyone is going to have some financial need over the next 12 months, in different areas, and rightly so.\u201d Has the crisis made her think even more deeply about moral questions as to how sport is funded \u2013 and how much money it deserves compared with health and education? \u201cIt has because we\u2019re suddenly in a very different world. We\u2019re always needing more money and we feel sport can spread inspiration across the nation but the pandemic has put everything on hold. It forces you to ask the right questions. Ultimately, what is important? What role should sport play in our lives? \u201cIn a global crisis we need to think how we will feel when we look back at this period in a year or 10 years\u2019 time. We will think: \u2018What part did we play?\u2019 Those of us who work in sport and love sport always believe in its inspiration. But when deaths are coming and people are losing jobs, sport has a deeper role. How can sport help communities rebuild? Sport still has its part to play but not in the way we expect in more ordinary times.\u201d Sport will almost certainly have to accept less money than it has been given in the past. The problem is complicated by the fact that the current four-year cycle for Olympic and Paralympic sport ends next March. How will sporting bodies fund their teams as they prepare for Tokyo that summer? \u201cSome money will be saved by not travelling and not competing but we\u2019re looking at a cycle when some sports will suffer big losses. We\u2019re looking at who\u2019s going to be at risk in the next few months and what is ultimately needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve reassured everyone the money is in place until March and going right through next summer but we don\u2019t have any money for next summer yet so we\u2019re putting it to government as well. We could say it\u2019s as simple as needing a 12-month rollover, because we have a new Olympic year coming up, but do we accept a reduced three-year funding cycle for Paris in 2024? \u201cEach has different ramifications so a few scenarios are being worked on. We\u2019ve had a call with the sports minister and the people in the civil service, the DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], have been very supportive and understanding. We\u2019re confident they feel sport has to remain ambitious and our teams prepare properly. We just have to see whether that\u2019s feasible.\u201d There is an additional worry for Grainger because much of UK Sport\u2019s funding comes from the national lottery \u2013 and ticket sales had begun to dwindle long before coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s always a concern. Other lotteries have emerged and that\u2019s complicated things. The obvious prediction is that this is not going to be a good time for lottery sales. This will have a direct impact on sport. So we do not have an easy financial future.\u201d Grainger has been the chair of UK Sport for exactly three years this month and feels confident she can negotiate the minefield as to which sports deserve funding when the next cycle begins. She acknowledges some sports \u2013 including badminton and wheelchair rugby \u2013 have cause to feel they have been harshly treated and suggests the crisis will demand an even more thoughtful approach. When she began the job, UK Sport was emerging from 10 years where the mantra of \u201cno compromise\u201d underpinned the belief that only medals counted. A bullying culture pervaded some sports and the mental health of many athletes was affected. Grainger has encouraged a more balanced approach to elite sport but stresses the climate had already shifted in 2016. \u201cRio was our most successful Olympics and Paralympics but it didn\u2019t take long for athletes to say there was a human cost. When I came in UK Sport was already responding, so I can\u2019t take all the credit for changing the culture. As a former athlete I could say of course it\u2019s competitive high performance and it will always feel hard. That\u2019s not a bad thing but it should also feel safe and people should be able to speak out. \u201cWe had an environment where some people thought they could behave in any way as long as medals were being won. That\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s a lot better now but we shouldn\u2019t sit back because it\u2019s constantly evolving.\u201d Before Covid-19 Grainger\u2019s ambition had been evident in her belief it was conceivable GB could one day top the medals table at an Olympic Games. Was this a specific aim? \u201cNot necessarily. We had been asked about our biggest ambitions by the media. Could we ever become the best Olympic nation globally? We did a piece of work to see whether it was feasible to become No 1. The results were that it\u2019s possible but it would take a significant investment over three Olympic cycles. \u201cIt was useful to tell our government this was possible but some of the new Olympic sports haven\u2019t played to our strengths. So we\u2019re up against more than expected and it would be at least three Olympics away. It\u2019s a long-term thing but we were looking mainly for public feedback as to what they want from sport. They wanted more sports to be given the opportunity. The public like a broader range of sports to win medals. The key move would be to maximise the number of sports with medal potential.\u201d Such talk hardly matters now. Surely Grainger would settle for Britain slipping down from second in Rio to fifth or sixth place at Tokyo if money was spent in areas of society which need it most? \u201cThere\u2019s some comfort being in the top five. If we\u2019re anywhere in that top five we can take a lot of pride. I don\u2019t think people will remember where we finished after a while. They will remember the stories rather than the details and numbers.\u201d We discuss how sport can lift a national mood and the conversation lightens. \u201cI am ultimately a helpless optimist,\u201d Grainger says. \u201cThat helped me through a lot of worry and adversity when I was competing. So I am still excited about the future of UK Sport not only in terms of medals but in having a positive impact on society once we get out of this crisis. I see all the good sport can do. So we should remain ambitious. Sport still has an important role to play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
