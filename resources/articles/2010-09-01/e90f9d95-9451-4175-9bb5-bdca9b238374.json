Gift Aid, which allows charities to claim tax relief on donations from UK taxpayers, generated an extra \u00a31bn in 2008-09. But ResPublica estimates that charities are missing out on a further \u00a3750m because of \"wasteful red tape and bureaucracy\". ResPublica says its proposed reforms would also benefit Revenue and Customs, which spends \u00a35 processing each claim. The report by ResPublica's deputy director, Asheem Singh \u2013 called Digital Giving, Modernising Gift Aid: Taking Civil Society into the Digital Age \u2013 is timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the creation of Gift Aid. It calls for: \u2022 The creation of an online system to let charities submit Gift Aid claims electronically. The report says it is an anomaly that charities have to file claims by post. \u2022 A new digital giving steering group to work with the mobile phone industry to ensure Gift Aid keeps up with new forms of donation. Text donations, which formed a significant proportion of recent donations to victims of the Pakistan floods, would become eligible for Gift Aid. This could raise an extra \u00a315.4m a year by 2014. \u2022 An end to transitional relief for Gift Aid, introduced to compensate charities when the basic tax rate was cut. The report says the government would be better off reforming the system than \"tinkering with tax thresholds\". It says: \"It is in society's long-term interest to nurture the donor-charity relationship through getting more people to participate in civil society.\" Phillip Blond, the \"Red Tory\" who founded ResPublica and influenced the thinking behind David Cameron's \"big society\", is wary of state action and believes in encouraging individuals to take greater responsibility. ResPublica was commissioned to carry out the report by the Charities Aid Foundation and is confident its proposals will be well received by the government. Nick Hurd, the charities minister, will attend the report's launch today. Blond will say: \"Reform is years overdue \u2026 if Gift Aid is to work, then it must be simple to administer and cost-effective. \"We advocate the use of new technology to reach out to a whole new generation of donors, who do not respond to traditional fundraising appeals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
