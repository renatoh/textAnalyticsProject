Thanks for joining me. 90 mins: Jordan Ayew is held up by Ngadeu and goes down under the pressure but the referee is having none of it. Yiadom picks up the loose ball but his shot is poorly hit and straight at the goalkeeper. Partey smashes a shot very high over the bar from 25 yards. 88 mins: An utterly atrocious pass from Biyik allows in Kwabena who dribbles towards the edge of area, cuts in and whacks a vicious shot against the bar, making all weldings in the ground winces. 86 mins: This game deserves to be a goalless goal. 84 mins: Malong comes off the bench, immediately gives the ball away and then fouls his opponent when trying to retrieve it 25 yards from his own goal. Not the best start from him. Wakaso hits the wall with the free-kick. 81 mins: Fai smashes a cross - or maybe it was a shot - but it goes nowhere near the net or any players in the box. Bassogog hits the post after a neat one-two with Choupo-Moting but the assistant referee\u2019s flag goes up to call an offside despite him being two yards onside. 79 mins: Asamoah Gyan is on! Good to see he has not retired today. 77 mins: The foul count in this game must be huge! What\u2019s the record? Ps Ghana still can\u2019t string two passes together. 75 mins: Left-back Bong is replaced by Choupo-Moting, which will mean some sort of formation change. A ball is crossed into the box and lands on Bassogog\u2019s left foot and he whacks a vicious volley which smashes straight into Mensah\u2019s chest. That has got to hurt. 73 mins: Asamoah adds to the list of woeful cross just whacking one straight out for a goal-kick from the left wing. Kana-Biyik is caught by Jordan Ayew\u2019s studs and stays down for a while. Not much to see. Cameroon give the ball back, which is nice of them. 71 mins: Fai, with all the time in the world, puts the ball behind his own goal. Wakaso\u2019s corner is cleared at the front post. 69 mins: Wakaso gets a free-kick after getting the better of a couple of challenges and looks to break upfield but the referee puts a stop to that by calling a foul. 67 mins: Mark Bright is on co-comms and has just referenced a Guardian article, so that\u2019s lovely stuff. The pace of the has seriously dropped here. Here it is, from your main man Paul Doyle. 65 mins: Kasim is the first man to go into the book after catching Toko on the neck. He is just trying to palm the striker off but catches him quite high, so the referee finally pulls his cards out. 63 mins: The free-kick is sent into the box but the Ghanaian attackers are ruled offside, so that\u2019s the end of that chapter. 61 mins: Jordan Ayew is pushed over by Anguissa. It is a professional foul but the referee is not good enough to spot that it\u2019s worth a booking. 59 mins: Fai gets the ball out of his feet on the right and curls in a wonderful cross which looks destined for Njie\u2019s head but Mensah in front of him gets the slightest of flicks on it, sending it beyond Njie. 57 mins: Choupo-Moting is warming up and his presence is becoming increasingly necessary. 55 mins: Rahman whips in a cross for Andre Ayew to attack, he tries to volley it ahead of Ngadeu but his effort goes well wide. Ayew complains to the referee who laughs in his face, which works for me. Wakaso thwacks another shot at goal, this one flashing just wide, so he\u2019s getting closer. 53 mins: Ghana\u2019s passing has been particularly poor through this. They haven\u2019t created a notable chance since the ninth minute and have just keep overhitting balls over the top to no one. They need to be far cleverer here, maybe getting Andre Ayew into it more. Mandeck cleans out Jordan Ayew cynically before he can get away from him. 51 mins: Wakaso does Bassogog with a foul but the Cameroon winger has a cunning plan and just takes his opponent down. Fai drives in a cross but Yiadom heads clear. 49 mins: Wakaso runs through the middle of the park and decides to whack a shot from distance, he connects but it just keeps rising and rising. Down the other end, Bassogog tries to get the better of Rahman but forgets to take the ball with him and watches the Ghanaian run away with it. 47 mins: I can\u2019t wait for the attendance to be confirmed as it will be pretty embarrassing. Empty seats all over the place. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The Ayew brothers have barely had a kick. They need to offer more if Ghana are going to get into this game. Cameroon have been the better team here but really it\u2019s been a forgettable half. Oh and the referee is poor. 45 mins: Njie has just tried to score a free-kick from around 40 yards and it was utterly woeful, whacking it 55 yards over. One minute added on. 44 mins: Njie lifts a cross to the back post where Ngadeu climbs highest but he can only direct his header wide from six yards. Wakaso cuts down Anguissa for his own amusement to give away a free-kick but is not booked for his crime. 42 mins: WHAT A CHANCE! Some fine work by the Cameroon attackers, ending with Bassogog getting the ball in space in the area from a Toko pullback but his shot from 12 yards is close to the goalkeeper who sticks his arm up to tip it over. 40 mins: At least Eurosport have finally put this match on, which is very kind of them. We are cooking with gas! Additionally, it\u2019s becoming more watchable. 38 mins: The referee stops play after a shot is blocked and rebounds off him. He then stops the game and gives Ghana the ball back. This referee is awful. A cross is then sent into the Cameroon box and it just goes over Andre Ayew. 36 mins: Andre Ayew rolls around on the ground for a while, claiming he\u2019s been the wronged. Cameroon are supposed to kick it back but instead it\u2019s sent down the pitch to Njie in space, as the Ghana players are expecting the ball back they do not defend, allowing the winger to whack a shot which Ofori blocks with his chest. Cameroon not doing much for fair play in the last seven days. 34 mins: It\u2019s getting more exciting! Mensah chases down Toko who is after a ball over the top and manages to put in a superb tackle to stop a certain goal. Kana-Biyik whacks the subsequent corner at goal but it\u2019s flicked behind. 32 mins: Kana-Biyik tries to play a through ball but no one reads what he is trying to do and therefore it just runs through to the goalkeeper. No wonder Eurosport forgot to change the feed. Don\u2019t worry! If on Eurosport Player you click onto the link for highlights from the Ibiza Marathon, you can now watch the game. Cheers, lads. 30 mins: Jordan Ayew is given the chance to prove me wrong when a vicious cross lands on the edge of the six-yard box but the stretching striker can\u2019t control the ball and it bounces out for a goal kick. 28 mins: I do not want to speak ill of this game but it\u2019s pretty awful. For now, I will blame the heat. In half an hour I will blame Jordan Ayew for not being very good. 26 mins: Great that Eurosport promised to show this online but instead have left the superbikes on. Anyway ... Ghana have a corner but it will never be taken as the referee is moaning about nothing. This guy is already getting on my nerves. After a minute of arguing, the corner is delivered and cleared. Speed it up!! 24 mins: Yiadom takes down Njie with a reasonably fair challenge and looks annoyed that it\u2019s given. The bright-haired Njie is also angry. Nothing happens from the free-kick so it\u2019s all meaningless in the end. 22 mins: Njie takes down a long ball on his chest inside the area but he doesn\u2019t cushion it perfectly and it runs away from him, forcing him to foul a defender. 20 mins: The referee seems to be giving every little foul, which is a bit boring. Let it flow, mate. 18 mins: Not the quickest tempo to the game thus far, probably due to the fact it\u2019s so warm in Ismailia. There\u2019s a bit of noise in the stands but it certainly is not full. I am currently also getting live updates from Nick Ames who is actually in Egypt. He\u2019s not at the game, so they\u2019re quite mundane. 16 mins: Bassogog Sends in a corner to the back post where Ngadeu is waiting but the referee calls up the big Cameroon defender for a foul. 14 mins: A quiet passage of play as Atsu gets treatment on his hamstring for two minutes before wandering off. It looks like he will be replaced. 12 mins: Ghana get the ball moving quickly forward with Atsu driving up the pitch, before cutting in and whacking a shot just wide with his left. Sadly, for him, it looks like he has damaged himself and needs treatment. 10 mins: Cameroon break down the left through Bong but he slips the ball out of play. 8 mins: An Atsu corner goes through the box and is just about cleared. 4 mins: Not much happening at the moment, I\u2019ll be honest. Here we go! Teams (again)!! Had to jump onto the cricket due to Rob Smyth\u2019s losing electricity, so apologies for a quiet buildup. A reminder of how warm it is ... My contribution to this year\u2019s Afcon ... Pathetic planning, it would seem ... Come in singing ... All the players to watch ... Cameroon: Onana, Fai, Kana-Biyik, Ngadeu-Ngadjui, Bong, Bassogog, Zambo-Anguissa, Mandjeck, Oyongo, Toko-Ekambi, N\u2019Jie Ghana: Ofori, Yiadom Rahman, Mensah, Kasim. Wakaso, Partey A Ayew, J Ayew, Atsu, Asamoah Good evening! Cameroon are looking to seal a spot in the knockout stages with a win here this evening. They are reigning champions so will be looking to keep their crown but Ghana will be tricky opposition in Ismailia. Guinea-Bissau held out for over an hour against Cameroon in their opening fixture, so Ghana will be confident they can get something tonight. Ghana will be disappointed to only draw against Benin last time round but they have the firepower to do some damage in this tournament. The Ayew brothers found the net in the 2-2 draw with Benin, so they will be looking to follow that up. Should be an interesting encounter!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
