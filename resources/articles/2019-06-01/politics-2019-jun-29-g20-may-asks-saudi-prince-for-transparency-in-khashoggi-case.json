The prime minister held a bilateral meeting with Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday at what will be May\u2019s final global summit before she steps down in July. A senior government official said May had called for an open and transparent legal process in the case of the Saudi journalist who was murdered in Istanbul \u2013 and underlined the importance of the relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia. \u201cOn accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the PM said the legal process needed to be open and transparent,\u201d the senior official said, adding that the pair had \u201cconcluded by agreeing on the importance of the relationship\u201d and of \u201cregional stability\u201d. Khashoggi was brutally murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year. Riyadh has claimed the attack was a \u201crogue operation,\u201d and has put several people on trial behind closed doors. But a report by a UN special rapporteur recently found that Khashoggi had been \u201cthe victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible\u201d. On the conflict in Yemen, the official said: \u201cThe PM reiterated the need to keep working on finding a political solution to end the conflict, which is causing significant humanitarian suffering.\u201d UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia were ruled to be illegal by the court of appeal earlier this month because of the government\u2019s failure to assess the potential humanitarian impact of the weapons\u2019 use in Yemen. Delivering the judgment, Sir Terence Etherton, the master of the rolls, said ministers had \u201cmade no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, or during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so\u201d. The UN has called the conflict in Yemen the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, estimating in February that 17,700 civilians had died, and 3.3 million people remained displaced. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has said the government will appeal against the ruling. May\u2019s demeanour as she met the crown prince did not appear as frosty as it did when she met Vladimir Putin on Friday, when she upbraided him over the Salisbury poisoning, calling it a \u201ctruly despicable act\u201d. May also told the Russian president she would continue to defend liberal values, after he gave an interview to the Financial Times in which he claimed liberalism was \u201cobsolete\u201d and made light of the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal in the UK. Putin said: \u201cListen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This [Skripal] spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopeks. Or even \u00a35, for that matter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
