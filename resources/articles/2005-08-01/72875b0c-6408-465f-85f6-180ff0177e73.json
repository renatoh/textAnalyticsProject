The French international midfielder joined Juventus in a \u00a313.7m deal last month and Terry said: \"I'm not quite sure what impact it will have on Arsenal. He is a world-class player. He is obviously going to be a big miss. \"If you took one of our midfielders out of the team that would be the same. I can't even imagine our team without Frank Lampard in it. I really don't know what will happen. \"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has some great players and has some young players who can maybe step into the hole and maybe be as good as him one day. But I think initially they will miss him.\" Terry was speaking on Sunday night after Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Milan in New Jersey when the England international defender had helped keep the Milan strikers Christian Vieri and Alberto Gilardino quiet. Only a Rui Costa goal 10 minutes from time denied Chelsea a morale-boosting three straight wins from their games in the United States but the team showed enough cohesion to return to England full of optimism. Terry has branded the tour a success in every department and is hoping Chelsea's form will lead to the psychological bonus of a long-awaited win over Arsenal before the start of the Premiership season. He added: \"We didn't beat Arsenal last year despite winning the title. I think it's been a few years since we've beaten them in the league. We've drawn a few at their place. It would be nice to get a win under our belt and the Community Shield would be the perfect place to do it and to get one up on them. \"We feel really sharp, the training has been brilliant and we feel really good. The attitude at the club is the same as it was last season. We came here to win games just as we will go into the Community Shield to win. We don't want to lose even if it's a friendly. We lost last year to Milan and we were really disappointed. \"We wanted to do well here and win three games and then win the Community Shield so we go into the season on a real high.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
