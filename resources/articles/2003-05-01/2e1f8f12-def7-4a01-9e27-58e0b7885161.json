Bring England to town, get two of the world's most famous faces to smile at each other for photographs that will be seen all over the globe, and have Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson on stage at your official launch party. Danny Jordaan is making it all look easy and using England to give South Africa global exposure. 'We arranged a charter flight for England to go and see Mandela, and everything went off without a hitch,' explained Jordaan, head of South Africa's campaign. 'It was a flawless execution of our plan.' Just being a plan put it ahead of England's muddled attempt four years ago, when the FA were unable to market their own property half as effectively. Pitching for the 2006 tournament, the best wheeze we could come up with was pressurising Manchester United to withdraw from the FA Cup. So good luck to South Africa, who might just need it now Beckham and his pals have gone home. A paragraph about security in the same Daily Mercury that featured the England captain's meeting with Mandela on the front and several pages inside gave a subtle indication of why South Africa may still find acceptance a struggle. 'No admittance without tickets. Alcohol and bottles will not be allowed within the stadium. Spectators are advised not to carry firearms.'
