Sources say she has been advised not to go any further because the situation was so \"muddied\" by her own interview with the News of the World last Sunday. \"It would also mean an investigation into the whole affair, which she will not welcome,\" said one source. But today the consensus of opinion was that the countess, who is a PR consultant, will suffer more damaging revelations this weekend because of mistakes made by Buckingham Palace aides, say sources close to the affair. They say News of the World editor Rebekah Wade has been \"backed into a corner\" and now has no option but to publish the contents of the tape recordings obtained by an undercover reporter. \"She has got to recover some ground and the only way she can do it is to publish the tapes,\" said one source on the paper. \"We looked really lame. We got a good headline out of the interview, but we just looked like puppets,\" said an insider. Newspaper executives were said to be horrified by the reaction of rival papers on Monday. But the pressure is also mounting on Buckingham Palace communications secretary Simon Walker. He is being blamed for failing to limit the damage. \"The advice that Buckingham Palace gave was spectacularly badly judged and there is only one place in the palace that could have come from. \"I think his standing might be judged in a different light.\" \"Issuing denials about a story that looks to be true is like waving a red rag to a bull,\" said one source close to the royals. Mr Walker has already been blamed in newspaper reports for opening a rift between the Palace and the PCC. Palace claims that it had clinched a deal with the News of the World on the advice of the PCC were categorically denied yesterday by PCC chairman Lord Wakeham in a letter to the Daily Telegraph. Others say the mishandling of the affair will delight Prince Charles's aide Mark Bolland who has been keeping his distance. \"He has a working relationship with the press. He knows how the papers operate.If Sophie had gone to him for advice she may not have been in the position she is now in,\" said one source familiar with the royals.
