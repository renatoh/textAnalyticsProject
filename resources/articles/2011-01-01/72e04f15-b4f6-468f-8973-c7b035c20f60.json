Essentially this entertaining dog's dinner is a backstage musical on wheels as bigwig producer Oscar Jaffee hightails it out of Chicago after his latest disaster in what is becoming a trainwreck of a career. But Jaffee knows that his former protege and lover, Lily Garland, now a Hollywood star, is on the train on her way to appear in a stage show being mounted by his former office boy-turned-successful-producer. If Oscar can only get her signature on a contract, his own career will be revived. Religious fruitcakes, vain matinee idols and a train full of would-be playwrights ensure that havoc ensues as Oscar uses fair means and foul to win Lily to his cause. Like Comden and Green's Bells Are Ringing, which was such a hit at this address a couple of months ago, this is delicious nonsense, but while it has plenty of similar wise-cracking wit, it doesn't have the warmth. None of the characters are particularly likable, let alone lovable. That said, Ryan McBryde's production and clever staging, which uses just a couple of doors and some trunks and suitcases to ingenious effect, works up a head of steam and offers plenty of fun, particularly in its second half, as the farce unravels. It's impossible to dislike a musical that includes a barnstorming number entitled She's a Nut, and the cast deliver an evening that may not quite be champagne but which has plenty of fizz. Until 15 January. Box office: 020-7261 9876."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
