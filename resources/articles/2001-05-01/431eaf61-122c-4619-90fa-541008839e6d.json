But Damon Krukowski and his wife Naomi Yang (once two-thirds of the influential American avant-rockers Galaxie 500) have other ideas about live performance. For a start, the audience are treated like unexpected guests who have popped in just as the hosts were heading for bed. The current album, Damon and Naomi with Ghost, takes quiet-is-the-new-loud a step further than their previous records. It's a collaboration with Japanese psychedelic wanderers Ghost, whose wispy guitarist Michio Kurihara joins them tonight. Their pastoral neo-folk virtually dissolves on contact with the Garage's smoky air, and all but the first rows can forget about hearing much beyond a faint hum. The few who are near enough are transported, listening with eyes closed as Naomi's clear voice washes over Damon's acoustic guitar and Kurihara's electric doodlings. A cover of Song to the Siren lends the folkie standard a grace that over-familiarity had all but extinguished. As it drifts to a stop the couple flop back in their seats; if they were alone, this is when they would put the kettle on. The feeling of barging into their private domain hangs in the air, but the music becomes more emphatic on The Great Wall, overpowering Damon's Dylanesque rasp. Naomi's tour de force, Tanka, is even more of a wig-out, all three musicians genteelly straining at their leads and changing the topography of the set. At which point, of course, it ends, leaving those at the front mesmerised by this whisper of a show. \u0095 At the Roadhouse, Manchester (0161-228 1789), tonight, then touring."}, "isHosted": false}}}
