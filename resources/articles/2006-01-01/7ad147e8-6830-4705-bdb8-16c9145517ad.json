Luton boss Mike Newell met with the FA's compliance department last week in the wake of his claim that bungs have been offered to him by agents and even club directors, while the game's governing body has since contacted QPR's manager Ian Holloway after he suggested he had been offered a bribe to push through a player's transfer. Even England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was alleged to have told an undercover reporter of transfer impropriety involving top-flight clubs. \"There has been a consistency and a frequency of these allegations that have been swimming around,\" said Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore. \"We owe it to the people in the game to nail these allegations once and for all. The clubs are fed up with the unfounded speculation that goes unchecked. We will get to the bottom of this one way or the other. \"This inquiry has the unanimous support of all 20 clubs; that is very important when you consider that matter. We do not know who will conduct the inquiry but it will be a wholly independent one and it will be chaired by a QC or a professional person of similar standing.\" The chairman of the inquiry will be named on February 16. Scudamore hopes the inquiry will benefit football in the future by making transfers more transparent. \"We have to be very clear about the terms of reference - they are to investigate transfer dealing concluded since January 2004 and to report any findings of irregular payments to and from officials of any club,\" he added. \"Clearly, also in doing this we are looking for the chairman of the inquiry to make recommendations as to how the Premier League and its clubs can improve any processes in the future in order to address this situation. \"The inquiry method will be different to how the Premier League would normally work. What we envisage happening is an information gathering phase whereas in the past we have talked about evidence only. It will be up to the chairman of the inquiry to then take that information and convert it from investigation into evidence. We want evidence put into two categories - evidence to support wrongdoing or to prove there is no wrongdoing. We are trying to make sure this situation is nailed, transparent and that the inquiry comes up with something.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
