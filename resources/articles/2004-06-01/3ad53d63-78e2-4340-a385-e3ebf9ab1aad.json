Paul Marshall, 39, who works in the control room at Wandsworth police station, pleaded guilty over charges involving the use of a police computer to provide information to unauthorised people. Three other men, all of whom work in the private investigations industry, pleaded not guilty on the same charge. They are Alan King, a 58-year-old private investigator from Coulsden in Surrey, as well as 52-year-old John Boyall from Caterham, Surrey, and 55-year-old Stephen Whittamore from New Milton, Hampshire, both of whom are directors of private detective agencies. All four men are accused of charges that relate to the period between May 2 2002 and August 4 2003. The arrests were made as part of Operation Glade, an investigation into links between police and the press. Marshall, who has been suspended from his police job, pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of theft. He is alleged to have stolen several items from the Metropolitan Police, including a holster and a jacket. A date for a full trial has not yet been set. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
