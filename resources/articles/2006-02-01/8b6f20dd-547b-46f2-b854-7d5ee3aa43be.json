Lord Ashdown, who led the Liberal Democrats from 1988-1999, tells activists that Sir Menzies is a \"national leader\" and praises his \"undisputed authority and credibility\". The letter was released after a YouGov poll, commissioned by a Chris Huhne supporter, showed the newly elected MP for Eastleigh four points ahead of the acting leader, Sir Menzies. In a carefully worded letter backing Sir Menzies Lord Ashdown takes an implicit sideswipe at the \"inexperience\" of Chris Huhne for lacking the \"proven track record\" without directly naming him. Lord Ashdown wrote, \"Ming Campbell is the candidate with the greatest experience. Nothing can prepare a person for the challenge of becoming a party leader. What we need is someone with a proven track record in parliament and politics. A leader who has consistently shown the character and judgement to command the confidence of his colleagues.\" Lord Ashdown makes no mention either of rival candidate Simon Hughes whose campaign suffered a further setback today when the YouGov poll place the party president third. The survey of 401 Liberal Democrats gives Mr Huhne a 38% share of first preferences among members who had already made up their minds, ahead of Sir Menzies' 34% and Simon Hughes, on 27%. Assuming Mr Hughes is eliminated in the first round, re-allocating the second preferences of his supporters also gives Mr Huhne a four-point lead over the older candidate, with 52% to Sir Menzies' 48%. Among members who have yet to pick a favoured candidate, Mr Huhne enjoys a 3% lead over Sir Menzies. However, more than a third of the sample thought he had too little experience at Westminster to lead the party. The poll also shows widespread approval for Mr Huhne's policy of imposing \"green taxes\", with over three-quarters of Lib Dems keen to tax fuel more heavily. Nonetheless, a quarter believe the overall tax burden should not rise. The result follows a string of smaller polls suggesting that Sir Menzies' appeal to party members is waning after an energetic campaign by his rival, a former MEP and journalist. Sir Menzies has been criticised for adopting a laid-back approach to the contest. Despite his overall lead, members polled indicated that they had a number of reservations about Mr Huhne's ability to lead the party. A majority (42%) thought he was the candidate best placed to appeal to female voters, but they were less convinced that he would challenge Tony Blair and David Cameron effectively in the Commons (27%), unite the party (26%) or come over well in the press (31%). When asked which of the three candidates would stand the best chance of winning more seats at the next election, Sir Menzies and Mr Huhne were neck and neck on 30%. The poll makes depressing reading for Mr Hughes, who has failed to recover from his unwilling revelation that he has had homosexual relationships. More than a quarter of those polled said that Mr Hughes should \"definitely not\" become leader, with fewer than one in seven prepared to describe the party's president as honest. The membership rated \"protecting civil liberties\" as the highest priority of a new leader. Most also believe that tackling climate change is a key policy area. Closer European integration and reducing poverty abroad were considered much less important. A spokesman for Sir Menzies - whose nickname is Ming - said: \"This poll does not accord with any of the canvassing that we have been doing throughout the campaign. \"The Liberal Democrat membership is saying that Ming Campbell is the candidate who can best provide the party with credibility, experience and unity.\" The YouGov poll (pdf)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
