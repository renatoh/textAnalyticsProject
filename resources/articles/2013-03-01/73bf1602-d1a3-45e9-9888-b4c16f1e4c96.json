The three previously combined on the 2005 album At the Wood's Heart, and this broodingly beautiful music was recorded on their tour as Quercus the following year, though the sound is so clean it could be a studio set. An arrangement of George Butterworth's first world war setting of AE Housman's poem The Lads In Their Hundreds turns on the contrast between jaunty piano and sax lines and the war-presaging lyric; Shakespeare's Come Away Death is a slow chant for Tabor and Ballamy's low-pitched tenor sax in unison; and Ballamy's own jazzier Near But Far Away has a Charles Lloyd-like delicacy at the other end of the register. A tango on Who Wants the Evening Rose, and the jazz standard This is Always represent occasional accelerations of tempo, and American monk Gregory Norbet's haunting lyric All I Ask of You (which Ballamy evocatively used in memory of a departed loved one on his 1989 album Balloon Man) closes the set. Nobody plays a note too many or expresses a false emotion. It's a unique tribute to the power of song. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2 013. The original referred to AE Housman's first world war poem The Lads In Their Hundreds. That should have been George Butterworth's 1912 setting of Housman's poem of 1896. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
