Haq, a one-legged veteran guerrilla leader, had penetrated Taliban territory south of Kabul in a bid to drum up support for a coalition government to take control if the west succeeds in toppling the hardline Islamic regime. \u00b7 Traces of anthrax have been discovered in the US state department and CIA headquarters.

Saturday October 27 \u00b7 Taliban forces claim to have hanged five opposition commanders captured after a repelled Northern Alliance attack on one of the hardline regime's strongholds. If the unverified claim is true, it will be a further blow to opposition forces already reeling from the summary execution yesterday of Abdul Haq, a prominent Northern Alliance commander. \u00b7 In buses and trucks, pickups and vans, more than 5,000 people roll out of a north-eastern Pakistan village, bound for the Afghan frontier and vowing to fight a holy war against the United States.

At least 13 people are killed, according to witnesses and neighbours. \u00b7 Suspected Islamist gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs underline the sense of creeping anarchy engulfing Pakistan by shooting dead 16 people, mainly women and children, inside a church during morning prayers, in apparent revenge against Christians for America's bombing of Afghanistan. \u00b7 A pair of Palestinian gunmen go on a killing spree in the coastal town of Hadera, killing four Israeli women in an attack that plays into the hands of Israeli hardliners urging an all-out war on Yasser Arafat's self-rule authority. \u00b7 Whitehall's impatience with media pressure over the pace and direction of the campaign against terrorism boils over, as Jack Straw accuses the press and TV of constantly demanding fresh news, while increasingly neglecting the causes of the conflict. \u00b7 For the first time in 47 days the digging stops, as the families of those who died in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre come to the first official memorial service in their honour. \u00b7 Politicians attempt to shore up public support for the US-led air strikes on Afghanistan amid mounting concern about civilian casualties and the slow progress of the military campaign.

Monday October 29 \u00b7 American war planes reportedly bomb Taliban positions on Afghanistan's northern border with Tajikistan for the first time since the conflict began. \u00b7 Israel, under heavy pressure from Washington, pulls its troops from two of the six Palestinian-controlled towns it entered after a cabinet minister was assassinated. \u00b7 A female New Jersey postal worker becomes the eighth confirmed case of inhalation anthrax in the US, as health officials continue their search for evidence of contamination and thousands of Americans take preventive antibiotics. \u00b7 America is put on the highest state of alert as the attorney general says he has specific, credible information of further \"very serious\" terrorist attacks in the coming days. \u00b7 Defence secretary Geoff Hoon admits that British troops are not ready to carry out operations in Afghanistan. The admission adds to the evidence that in Britain and in the US there is increasing tension between frustrated political leaders and cautious military commanders. He also says that any Briton who fights with the Taliban against US and British forces could be prosecuted on their return. \u00b7 A terrorist-tracking taskforce is to be created to prevent foreigners planning to commit terrorist acts from entering America, President George Bush announces. The White House said the taskforce would pave the way for agencies \"to work together to prevent aliens who commit or support terror from entering the United States\". Tuesday October 30 \u00b7 Air strikes on Afghanistan resume with US jets attacking the southern city of Kandahar.
