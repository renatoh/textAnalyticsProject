Locals remember it was 21 August and the investment banker and his coterie were poking around Porter Promenade like two couples on a quiet getaway. \u201cThe women were well-dressed, trendy tropical,\u201d one long-term Mission Beach resident recalls. \u201cOne of the guys was wearing shorts and a polo shirt, a bit scruffy looking almost.\u201d Without identifying themselves, Mawhinney and John Anasis, both key figures in the Melbourne-based investment fund Mayfair 101, walked into the far north Queensland community\u2019s real estate offices, asked to see lists of available properties and said: \u201cWe want to buy all of them.\u201d Company records show that the day before they turned up in Mission Beach, Mawhinney and Anasis registered a $2 company, Mainland Property Holdings, that would become involved in the proposed purchase of more than 230 local homes, caravan parks, commercial spaces and empty blocks of land. Mainland, which Mayfair says is part of its corporate group, has so far spent at least $7.4m taking out options to buy the properties. Even as the first few sales are finalised, many locals say they remain sceptical about Mayfair, whose plan includes the $31m purchase of Dunk Island, the resort that has been derelict since 2011 after being battered by tropical cyclones Larry and Yasi. Mawhinney says sleepy Mission Beach \u2013 also badly damaged during those cyclones and two hours from the nearest serviceable airport \u2013 can become a major tourism destination. The investment fund is still looking for the cash to fund the full scope of its contracted property purchases, but talks about investing $1.6bn in the area and creating more than 10,000 jobs \u2013 triple the local population. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the purchases are staggered to settle at various times over the next nine months. But the plan also requires a steady stream of investors, and Mayfair is still in the process of attempting to drum up interest. There are emerging signs that the reality may not match the vision Mawhinney announced when he first arrived, or the hype generated by the billboards, newspaper ads and glamorous parties that have followed. The largest single proposed property purchase, the Elandra resort at the far south of the beach, had been slated to be sold to Mayfair for $5.5m, to settle in February next year. It was quietly placed back on the market this week. The rush for the exit Mission Beach is actually four villages \u2013 South Mission Beach, Wongaling Beach, North Mission Beach and Bingil Bay \u2013 spread among dense tropical bush that in places touches the shore, one of the few places in the world where two world heritage sites meet: the rainforest and the reef. Up and down the long stretches of beach, faded for sale signs are now mostly covered by sold stickers. More than a dozen sellers spoke to Guardian Australia. Some say their properties had been on the market for years, unable to realise the investments made since 2006 and 2007, when prices last spiked. There is now a rush to leave town as properties begin to settle. Rob O\u2019Neill, one half of the town\u2019s only removals crew, moved up from Lightning Ridge a few months ago. He told Guardian Australia he was now booked solid until March as people move out. Sellers recall being given little information by real estate agents, just that there was a cash buyer, and to come into the office to sign paperwork. In most cases that the Guardian has seen, the terms gave Mayfair\u2019s companies a 90-day due diligence period, with a deposit due at the conclusion. The chaotic attempts to scrutinise and process more than 200 real estate transactions seemed at times to overwhelm the local real estate offices. In some cases, Mayfair asked for extensions to the due diligence period. Some were granted; in others the seller backed out. One seller tells Guardian Australia that Mayfair decided not to buy his property before the 90-day deadline had expired. \u201cThey just seemed to go in so fast, then we heard absolutely nothing until right before the 90 days. My place is not on the beach, so it was probably well down the list of their priorities. They went from \u2018yep, we\u2019ll buy it sight unseen\u2019 to just dropping out like that,\u201d the resident says. \u201cLook at it this way, if I thought they would succeed in their grand plans, then I\u2019d have kept my house and watched the value go up, wouldn\u2019t I? A lot of people were desperate because the market has been so way down in the doldrums. Everyone saw that this was money the market wasn\u2019t willing to pay and thought \u2018right, it\u2019s time to get out of here\u2019.\u201d Mawhinney says some of the sales had fallen through and acknowledged that the significant number of purchases had in some cases delayed pre-purchase checks. \u201cSince initial contracts were signed, certain properties have had additional environmental and zoning due diligence undertaken,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result of this process, which is standard for all major property transactions, various properties have not passed due-diligence checks and the group has decided against proceeding with these purchases. \u201cMayfair 101 continues to settle on the properties it has contracted to purchase using its own resources, whilst fielding interest from a number of family offices, non-bank financiers and local and international investment groups who have all expressed interest in co-investing.\u201d Mawhinney says the Elandra resort purchase had fallen through during due diligence, but that he was optimistic a new contract could be negotiated. Fault lines deepen Long before Mawhinney and Mayfair came to town, Mission Beach was split along well-established fault lines dividing local environmentalists and business owners with competing visions. The property splurge created another fracture, between those eager for grand plans to go ahead and those who see a risk that Mission Beach could be left worse off. \u201cThe scepticism would be the same in any small town,\u201d says Nancy Lowe, who runs a dive boat and water taxi that used to ferry people to Dunk Island before cyclone Yasi. \u201cWhen something this big happens to such a small town everyone\u2019s always going to be wary and a little bit nervous, but the hope of something amazing happening is really strong.\u201d Lowe is the president of local industry group Tropical Coast Tourism. At its annual general meeting on Monday night, Mayfair Iconic Property\u2019s man in Mission Beach, Stuart Duplock, was voted in as vice president. Lowe says Mayfair has engaged with the local community better than any other developer who has shown an interest in Mission Beach. \u201cI think (the skepticism) is changing now properties have gone through completely,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe\u2019re realists, of course every block of land that has been developed around here there\u2019s risk. But that\u2019s the whole reason they\u2019ve bought the land on Mission Beach, to negate the higher risk on Dunk Island by investing somewhere else. No other company has had the level of intelligence to do that. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get a six star resort, but we\u2019re never going to be Palm Cove, we\u2019re never going to be Noosa or Port Douglas. When (Christopher) Skase came into Port Douglas there weren\u2019t any rules. We back on to world heritage. There\u2019s maximum build heights. Mayfair understand that Mission Beach has to retain its sleepy seaside village atmosphere. \u201cYou only need to look at what Hayman and Hamilton islands have done for Airlie Beach and you can only hope that something similar happen (with Dunk Island and Mission Beach).\u201d A business owner in the main street told Guardian Australia that most of his customers were still uneasy. He didn\u2019t want to be named because \u201cit\u2019s a small town and I don\u2019t want to rain on people\u2019s property sales\u201d. \u201cA lot of people are counting on it, but a lot of people have been trying to sell their properties for a long time. To them, a buyer is a buyer and good luck to them. \u201cThe people who come in here, everyone talks about it, on balance there\u2019s pessimism. A lot of people think it\u2019s pie in the sky and yeah we think there\u2019s a risk that Mission Beach is left worse off if they buy up half the town and everything grinds to a halt before Dunk Island gets built. \u201cMost of the people here they might want to see Mission Beach go ahead, but we\u2019d be mad not to look at something that seems too good to be true, and not question whether it is.\u201d What Mission Beach is all about Mission Beach has long been a hub for conservation work in the far north; the poet Judith Wright, John Busst and Len Webb first campaigned to save the Great Barrier Reef from mining from a home in Bingil Bay. The first reef day tours launched from the Perry Harvey jetty, providing access to nearby coral sites in the days before faster boats could leave from larger ports. \u201cMy biggest concern is that when you have these developments it brings in people with different expectations of how you live,\u201d says Peter Rowles, the president of the Community for Coastal and Cassowary Conservation \u201cThere are many of us who live here because we like the lifestyle, we like the place. If you live in a place you can either live with your environment or you can draw territories \u2013 where this is our place and that\u2019s the environment out there. We live here because we want to live with our environment.\u201d Rowles says the local cassowary population has been put at increased risk in recent years, as traffic on local roads increases. Mahwinney insists Mayfair will frame any development plans around input from the community and traditional owners, and that it wants to \u201cprotect the natural beauty\u201d of the area and populations of important local species like the cassowary. \u201cThe group is mindful of ensuring its development plans are in keeping with the natural, pristine beauty of the region whilst achieving our vision to make the area an Australian tourism mecca,\u201d he says. Liz Gallie, an artist and cassowary conservationist, says the natural world has always been an integrated part of the local community, rather than just a backdrop. \u201cThe rainforest doesn\u2019t get tired like built environment does,\u201d Galle says. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we embrace that? \u201cThe rainforest should be a block, you should be able to walk through it and then have this experience at the beach of coming out into another world. That\u2019s what Mission Beach is all about.\u201d Gallie said many people had been jolted by Mayfair\u2019s proposals and public comments about wanting to make Mission Beach a mass tourism destination. \u201cPlaces can change incrementally and one day you go, \u2018it\u2019s not like it used to be, we\u2019ve lost the magic\u2019. But this was thrown out in front of us as one grand plan. The lack of subtlety is a huge thing. It\u2019s made people go \u2018we really like it like this, that\u2019s the reason we came here\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s this little tiny place that\u2019s different to everywhere else, it\u2019s lush, it\u2019s got that important cassowary population, it\u2019s got the beaches, it\u2019s got the rainforest coming down, it\u2019s got that overwhelming beauty. It\u2019s called magic. \u201cPeople know it when they see one of those days, the Mission Beach magic. That\u2019s the point of difference that we\u2019ve got.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
