The soft drinks giant will carry out trials of redesigned, lighter plastic bottles. It will also carry out tests on the use of recycled plastic. The initiative could cut household waste in the UK by up to 4,000 tonnes a year if the packaging proves successful and is adopted by other companies, according to the Waste and Resources Action Programme, a government-funded project to promote recycling and waste reduction, which is responsible for the grant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
