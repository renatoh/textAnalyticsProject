It is the second Newspoll since the 9 May budget. Both have recorded numbers of 47%-53% in Labor\u2019s favour, showing a consolidation of Labor\u2019s lead. It is the 13th consecutive Newspoll in which the Coalition has trailed Labor. But Malcolm Turnbull retained his lead over Bill Shorten as preferred prime minister, leading by 45% to 33%. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the government\u2019s budget had been well received by voters and Turnbull had increased his lead in recent months over Shorten. \u201cWe will continue to go on and govern in a way that\u2019s good for Australians,\u201d he told Sky News on Monday. \u201cThe feedback from constituents and colleagues has been very positive.\u201d The primary support for the Coalition government and Labor remains unchanged since the Newspoll two weeks ago, with both steady at 36%. In a sign of widespread disenchantment with the two major parties, the poll shows 28% of voters surveyed continue to prefer minor parties, with 10% primary vote support for the Greens, 9% for One Nation and 9% for others including the Nick Xenophon Team. The poll comes after the Guardian Essential poll found 80% of voters believe banks will pass on the levy to consumers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
