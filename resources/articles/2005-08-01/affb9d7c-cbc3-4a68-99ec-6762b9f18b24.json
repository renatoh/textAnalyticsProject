At first sight - and the details remain obscure - that appears to be exactly what has happened. Tony Blair announced 12 proposals that he promised would \"set a comprehensive framework for action in dealing with the terrorist threat in Britain\". Yet Mr Blair's willingness to tamper with the Human Rights Act in order to send deportees to countries known to practice torture is alarming and could even jeopardise Britain's adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights. Several other measures have little to do with tackling the roots of UK-based terrorism. Into this category falls the most vague and objectionable of yesterday's proposals, the promise of new anti-terror legislation in the autumn including an offense of \"justifying or glorifying terrorism\" inside or outside the UK. It hardly needs a stretch of the imagination to see such an offence being shot down in the first court of any standing it reaches. Another proposal along these lines is for what the prime minister described as a list of \"specific extremist websites, bookshops, centres, networks and particular organisations of concern\" to be drawn up as a litmus test for foreigners: touch one and you will turn into an undesirable alien. Once again, the potential legal pitfalls for the government are very wide. These measures could have just as easily been drafted as a job creation scheme for the Society of Unemployed Human Rights Lawyers, if such a thing existed. Let us be clear that the most compelling objection to several of the proposals made by the prime minister yesterday is not that they intrude upon the human rights of every single resident and citizen of this country, although they certainly do that. Instead, the foremost objection is that these measures would have done nothing to stop the first and most deadly wave of suicide bombing on London's transport network on July 7. The first and best test of any legislation remains: will it work? Lists of proscribed websites will not change anything, and are likely to produce far more false leads and innocent suspects than clear and present dangers. And as a method of advertising the fringe lunatics of Islam through their \"websites, bookshops, centres, networks,\" or mosques for \"fomenting extremism\", publishing any such list would do that perfectly. Similarly, the banning of the Hizb ut-Tahrir is an unwise step. Hizb ut-Tahrir has some deeply objectionable views, not least on Palestine and Israel. Yet it appears committed to non-violence in the UK and seems far more interested in politics than direct action. Banning it is likely to force it further underground and radicalise its remaining members, as well as advertising it as a suitable rallying point for potential extremists. The outcome could indeed be the opposite of what Mr Blair hopes to achieve. Other proposals outlined by Mr Blair centre around extradition, deportation, asylum and nationality requirements. Some of these are disturbing, such as a blanket refusal of asylum to anyone of any nationality connected with terrorism - a highly subjective and problematic label. Such a measure, if enacted in the 1980s, would have excluded many members of the current government of South Africa from refuge in this country, to take one example. The extension of \"control orders\" - house arrest - on British nationals is another unwise move that should be challenged in parliament. Acknowledging resistance to the government's previous anti-terrorism proposals, Mr Blair declared \"the mood now is different\". That may be true. But it is the role of government not to act according to the mood of the country but in order to do what is good for the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
