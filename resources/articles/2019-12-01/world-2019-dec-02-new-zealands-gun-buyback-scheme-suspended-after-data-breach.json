The error became public on Monday when a gun lobby group said it had spoken to 15 people who were able to access information on a website where firearms owners registered weapons to be relinquished. It included their names, addresses, dates of birth, firearms licence numbers and bank account details, the group said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shopping list for criminals,\u201d said Nicole McKee, from the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners. She added that gun owners who had not turned in their weapons were \u201cnow being told they have to comply with a system that cannot be trusted\u201d. The website was shut down on Monday morning and would not be used until the police could guarantee the safety of information, officers said. Ardern won global praise when she announced six days after a gunman stormed two mosques in Christchurch, killing 51 Muslim worshippers, that the government would ban all the weapons used in the attacks. Less than a month later, a law prohibiting ownership of most semiautomatic weapons passed New Zealand\u2019s parliament by 119 votes to one. Since the law change, New Zealand\u2019s police have operated a buyback and amnesty scheme for now illegal weapons, magazines and parts which was due to finish in less than three weeks, on 20 December, at which point owners would be prosecuted for possessing them. On Monday New Zealand\u2019s deputy police commissioner, Mike Clement, said an update on the buyback scheme\u2019s website last week had caused personal information to be revealed more widely than it should have been. He blamed the software provider, the German company SAP, for what he called \u201chuman error\u201d. The site was custom-built for the gun buyback. Clement said officers knew of only one person, a gun dealer, who had received access to the information. Gun dealers have been permitted to act as collection agents for the buyback scheme for weapons owners who did not want to attend public events run by the police. But Clement said the dealer should not have been able to view so much detail, and the software update was \u201cnot authorised\u201d by the police. The person who had accessed it had done nothing wrong, he said. \u201cThis is a timely reminder to us all that we have to be particularly secure with people\u2019s personal information,\u201d he said, adding that the police had not done anything wrong either. SAP was \u201cworking through their audit logs\u201d to find out what information had been accessed. Clement said sharing personal information accessed through the site would be illegal. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty disappointed about this,\u201d the police minister, Stuart Nash, said. He would wait until he learned more about what had happened before he commented on whether anyone should be censured. Nash said the buyback had so far collected 43,000 weapons, most of them being \u201cthe type of firearms that are used to kill people\u201d. A second tranche of gun reforms before parliament would introduce a guns register \u2013 New Zealand issues permits to firearms owners rather than their weapons \u2013 and strengthen police powers to prevent certain people from gaining licences. McKee defended the group\u2019s decision to make the breach public, saying the revelations showed the buyback process had been \u201crushed\u201d. Her organisation had published screenshots of what the person had accessed, with identifying details removed. \u201cWe thought that it was imperative that we get the information out to the 38,000 people that their information had been compromised,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has to outweigh the possibility of getting more firearms in.\u201d Clement could not \u201coffer an absolute iron-clad guarantee\u201d that private information had not been misused, but he would investigate what had happened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
