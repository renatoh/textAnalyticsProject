Ian Huntley took the clothes back to Soham Village College, where he worked as a caretaker, and set them on fire, his Old Bailey murder trial was today told. The charred remains of the girls' red Manchester United shirts and other clothing were later found in a bin at the college by police. Stephen Coward QC, for Mr Huntley, said: \"The case for my client is, having cut off the clothes of the girls at the deposition site, he brought them back to Soham, put them inside one of the bins that we have seen outside the hangar, set fire to the contents and then replaced the bin inside the hangar.\" The admission came as the court heard the first forensic evidence in the case. The jury had previously been told that Mr Huntley, who denies murdering the two 10-year-olds, was unlikely to deny that they died while he was alone with them in his home, 5 College Close in Soham, Cambridgeshire. Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said that Mr Huntley also took their bodies to the ditch near Lakenheath, Suffolk, where they were found 13 days after the girls' disappearance on August 4 last year. The prosecution alleges that Mr Huntley set fire to the clothes, and also tried to burn the bodies, in a bid to destroy forensic evidence. No traces of semen were later found on the clothes, and a forensic expert said that that could have been due to their condition. Dr Helen Davey, a forensic scientist from the forensic science laboratory, based in Huntingdon, said: \"I think not getting a positive result could be because of the condition of the clothes rather than there being no semen there. \"Or, indeed, it could be because there was no semen there.\" The court was today shown photographs of all of the girls' clothing, which had been cut from their bodies in what Dr Davey suggested was a similar manner to the way in which medics cut off clothes in an emergency. Jagged cuts up the legs of tracksuit bottoms and through the shirts and underwear suggested that speed had been of the essence, she said. She told the court that the cut marks were typical of a pair of scissors, and seemed to have been made when the bodies were \"immobile\". Chemical tests suggested there could have been minute traces of blood on one of Holly's Nike trainers, and saliva on Jessica's football shirt. However, tests to try and obtain a DNA profile were unsuccessful. Almost all the clothing showed signs of soot and charring, and some of it had melted together, Dr Davey told the court. She said that the clothes had smelled of an accelerant. The jury later heard that petrol residue was found on the clothing, and on hair and soil samples from the ditch where the bodies were dumped. The court heard that fingerprints on a bin liner found above the burned clothing matched Mr Huntley's. The jury was shown a graphic that illustrated where the prints were found - on the inside and outside of the liner - and was told that they were consistent with someone smoothing it into place inside the bin. No fingerprints belonging to either girl were found inside Mr Huntley's house or car, the jury was told, except for those on a box of chocolates given by Holly to his then girlfriend, Maxine Carr, who had worked as the girls' primary school teaching assistant. Scenes of crime officer Susan Blackmore told the court that a number of \"blood spatters\" were found inside 5 College Close, including some in the hallway and the entrance to the main bedroom. She said that she was not involved in testing the possible bloodstains for DNA profiles. Another forensic expert, Roger Blackmore, said that he believed the girls' clothes were burned inside the bin where they were found. He said that cobwebs on lights above the yellow plastic bin had a \"dark discoloration\", but under cross-examination he said he had not removed the cobwebs to check whether or not the discoloration was caused by smoke. The cobwebs would probably have been destroyed if removed, and he knew of no method of testing them for smoke exposure, he said. He agreed that it was possible that the fire was started outside, as Mr Huntley's legal team alleged. The Soham jury was today also due to hear forensic evidence from Mr Huntley's red Ford Fiesta, which the prosecution allege he used to dump the bodies in the remote ditch. Mr Huntley, 29, denies murdering Holly and Jessica but has admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice. His ex-girlfriend Maxine Carr, 26, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two charges of assisting an offender. The prosecution alleges sthat he gave Mr Huntley a false alibi for the day the girls went missing. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
