No Grouse (12-1) was making it two wins from four starts this season in the Dove Handicap, but it was a desperately close call. He just held the renewed challenge of Loyal Tycoon by a short head, having taken up the running inside the final furlong. Winning trainer Eric Alston said: \"This is a grand horse to have in the yard. He is in at Ayr on Saturday, but I don't know if we will go there under a penalty, I shouldn't think the handicapper will put him up much for this today.\" Grandad Bill (5-4) had a little more to spare in the second division of the Middleham Castle Median Auction Maiden Stakes, but not too much. He also led inside the final furlong and then held the challenge of Astorygoeswithit by three-quarters of a length. This was third-time lucky for Grandad Bill and trainer Tim Easterby, who said: \"He is a nice little horse, but I still don't think he knew what it was all about. He is still green.\" Allan reflected: \"I was going to ride Princess Kiotto in the Ascot Stakes tomorrow, but she missed the cut by four, so it is a bit disappointing. \"But there is a chance I might ride Harvest Warrior in the Britannia, though I think he needs some rain.\" Yorkshire's most important week on the racing front started with a modest seller and the prize went the way of the Richard Fahey-trained Flying Key (11-2) in the hands of Paul Hanagan. However, the Fahey-owned filly left for pastures new, having been knocked down to Middleham trainer James Bethell after a bid of 11,500gns. Hanagan picked up a one-day suspension (June 24) for not riding to his draw. Karl Burke and Mick Channon, who will be in opposition in Wednesday's Queen Mary Stakes, were both on the mark, Royal Power (8-11) helping to keep up Tony Culhane's good record for the latter with a decisive success in the first division of the maiden. Channon will be bidding to win the Royal Ascot race for the third time when he sends out Flashy Wings, who carries the same colours as Royal Power. Burke, who took the Members Fillies' Handicap with the Darren Williams-ridden Banba (7-2), saddles Clare Hillls, of whom he said: \"She is a very fast filly, she has progressed physically since she won at Beverley, and she deserves to take her chance.\" Kevin Ryan was full of praise for apprentice Andrew Mullen after watching him bring Tedstale (9-2), a 25th winner in four years for the Yorkshire Racing Club, home in front in the White Swan Ampleforth Handicap. Ryan said: \"The step up in trip helped this horse and Andrew gave him an excellent ride. We have six horses for the Club, and I think 22 of their winners have come in the past two years.\" Kevin Darley teamed up with Roger Charlton to win the Go Racing In Yorkshire Maiden Stakes on All Ivory (4-5)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
