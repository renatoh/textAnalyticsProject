The community fund's new approach to making grants, which will be tested in Scotland from January, is designed to make it easier to apply for lottery cash. But it also marks a shift towards \"outcome-based\" grants, where applicants will be encouraged to show how their project will make a difference. If the pilot is successful, the system is likely to be extended across the UK by the new lottery distributor that is set to be formed from the merger of the community fund and the new opportunities fund (NOF). An \"administrative merger\" will mean that the new body will be launched in April. Gerald Oppenheim, the community fund's director of policy and communication said that, because of the new distributor, making wholesale changes to the grants programme was \"probably not sensible, but it is still important to try out some of the assumptions\" about how measuring projects' outcomes can work in practice. The new application process will have two stages. A short initial proposal form would state what the project aimed to do, how this would be carried out, what the longterm benefits would be and for whom. This \"pre-application\" form would then be reviewed by community fund staff, who would advise applicants on whether the proposal was worth working up for a full application. The initial form would be simpler than the current process and it s understood that grant officers would be able to \"pause\" the application process to give applicants a chance to strengthen weaker parts of their application. Mr Oppenheim said: \"It's a way of saving people vast acres of time filling in forms for projects that stand no chance or little chance of being funded.\" He added that the fund's assessment and monitoring procedures would need \"modifying\" to take account of the outcomes-based approach. \"The way we have been doing things has been very focused on what the outputs are. For example, you said you would see 100 people a year at the advice centre.\" The new approach would assess the real benefits the advice centre brought to its users, he said. \"Did you see the people, what advice did you give and did it help?\" Luke Fitzherbert, of the charity experts the Directory of Social Change said: \"We welcome this as a whole. But we are concerned that an over-rigid demand for measuring shortterm might disadvantage excellent charities whose work isn't easily expressed in this way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
