It is 13 years since Armstrong was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer which spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain; in 13 years he has won those seven Tour de France titles, established the Lance Armstrong Foundation and retired from cycling. Today he is back in the saddle, in Australia, and today his foundation goes global. In September the chairman of the Lance Armstrong Foundation announced the creation of the Livestrong Global Cancer Awareness Campaign and his return to competitive cycling. Unsurprisingly, the back pages of all the newspapers focused on the second part of that announcement, rather than the 37-year-old's plan to dispel the misconceptions surrounding cancer and convince world leaders to prioritise a disease that currently affects 25m people worldwide. But Armstrong says that the latter begets the former. He told the Guardian last year that this comeback is for himself and for the foundation, and specifically the global awareness campaign: \"I don't have to do this. I've gotta a lot of money and I've got a lot of comfortable things in my life. I want to do this. I want to do it for me. I want to do it for my foundation. I want to do it for eight million people who are going to die around the world this year of cancer. I just want to do it. This is not a F-U to anyone else. I just want to do this for me.\" To date the foundation's work has taken place primarily in the United States. Over $260m (\u00a3175m) has been raised in the pursuit of improvements in the prevention of cancer, quality of life for survivors, the provision of screening and care and investment in research. But now the foundation wants to have an impact worldwide on the stigmas, misconceptions and lack of awareness on the subject of cancer that exists. Andy Miller, vice-president for programmes and policy of the foundation, said the three elements of the campaign's attack are raising awareness, reducing the stigma attached to the disease in certain countries (specifically Mexico, Italy and South Africa at first) and garnering \"substantial commitments\" from world leaders, be they governments, NGOs or corporations: \"We have done a great deal of research with NGOs who work outside of the US as well as cancer leaders globally as to what role the foundation could play and based on the results of that research we have crafted our campaign to include those three activities. \"I think for us the enemy is not necessarily cancer, the enemy is apathy and ignorance of the impact this disease has,\" continued Miller. \"So it's less about a tangible outcome for cancer, but we want everyone who has the ability to prioritise cancer in the scope of their world, in the scope of their powers and responsibilities, to do that. We want them to recognise that this disease affects millions of people across the globe, kills millions of people and it deserves to be put on the highest priority of every government and every world leader because until we do that we are never going to see a cure.\" For the 2,000 men diagnosed annually with testicular cancer in Great Britain, Armstrong has already had an effect. Besides the $2m (\u00a31.35m) the foundation makes available for research every year, Krista Eleftheriou of Everyman (a campaign run by the Institute of Cancer Research to eradicate male cancers), says Armstrong's story, coupled with his high profile, has changed male perceptions of testicular cancer. \"There is certainly evidence that more men are being diagnosed in the early stages of testicular cancer and that is when the survival rates are highest. There have been publications and scientific journals that have attributed that to awareness campaigns such as Everyman,\" said Eleftheriou. \"I guess men do try to be quite tough and I don't think any man comes any tougher than Lance Armstrong, so it shows that even the toughest of men do get testicular cancer and it is just so crucial that men pay attention to their health.\" There is no doubt that as Armstrong battles the searing heat and climbs of his first serious race since 2005 his mind will be focused on victory \u2013 no one achieves what he has without a healthy dose of bloody-mindedness \u2013 but Miller believes he will judge success differently in his second coming: \"His primary reason for returning to cycling is the impact he sees that he can have, whereas previously it was his career, it was what he was doing. Certainly, he carried the message of being a cancer survivor with him, but I think in terms of the decision to go back it is central to the reason. He sees it as a much more complementary activity to the goals that the foundation have. He used to be wearing two hats, now he is integrating both of those roles.\" For how long will Armstrong pedal his bike and peddle his message of cancer awareness? \"As long as he feels he is having a positive impact and as long as our message is helping to support people who are affected by the disease across the globe,\" said Miller. \"I think as long as he has passion for it, as long as he thinks he is having a positive impact, I think he'll probably want to continue, but I do not know how long that will be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
