Jean Purdy was one of three scientists whose groundbreaking work led to the birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in 1978. Yet her central role was largely forgotten in the rush to praise her colleagues, Prof Sir Robert Edwards and the surgeon Patrick Steptoe. The letters show that Purdy\u2019s name was left off a plaque honouring her two colleagues, despite protests from Edwards. Letters revealed in Edwards\u2019 archive show that he wrote to Oldham Area Health Authority in 1980 asking if it would be possible to have plaques at the hospitals involved \u201cto do justice to the participants involved\u201d, and he proposed including Purdy\u2019s name. In a reply from an administrator, he was told that the authorised wording would read: \u201cHuman in vitro fertilisation followed by the world\u2019s first successful pregnancy, was performed in this hospital by Mr Patrick Steptoe, Dr Robert Edwards and their supporting staff in November 1977.\u201d Administrator David Killion wrote: \u201cI hope you will find it sufficiently acceptable to enable us at least to put up something to commemorate your work, even if this does not describe it as fully or as clearly as you would wish.\u201d Edwards protested in a letter of 1981, writing: \u201cI feel strongly about the inclusion of the names of the people who helped with the conception of Louise Brown. I feel this especially about Jean Purdy, who travelled to Oldham with me for 10 years, and contributed as much as I did to the project. Indeed, I regard her as an equal contributor to Patrick Steptoe and myself.\u201d However, the plaque at Kershaw\u2019s Cottage hospital near Oldham was put up without Purdy\u2019s name. The letters have been released from Edwards\u2019 private papers, which are held at Cambridge University\u2019s Churchill Archives Centre and have been opened to the public following work to catalogue the collection funded by the Wellcome Trust. Madelin Evans, an archivist, said the letters do not reveal an \u201cexplicit reason\u201d why Purdy\u2019s name was omitted but that \u201cit probably had quite a bit to do with the fact she was a nurse, an embryologist and a woman I suppose\u201d. Asked if it was a case of sexism, she said: \u201cI think it was probably one of the factors, and the fact probably that nurses weren\u2019t seen as important maybe as doctors and scientists.\u201d Purdy, who died from cancer in 1985 aged 39, was described by Edwards as \u201ccrucial\u201d to their IVF work and was the first person to witness the successful cell division of the embryo that would become Louise Brown. Having initially joined the team as a lab technician, Purdy became so indispensable that work stopped for several months when she had to care for her ailing mother. Edwards was awarded a Nobel prize in 2010 for the development of IVF and was knighted in 2011. Neither award can be made posthumously, so acknowledgment came too late for Purdy and Steptoe (who died in 1988) \u2013 but the discovery was a team effort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
