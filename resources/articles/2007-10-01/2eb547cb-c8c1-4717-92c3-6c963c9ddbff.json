The commissioner has told friends and colleagues that, irrespective of the jury's verdict concerning the death of the 27-year-old Brazilian, he will not be offering his resignation. The verdict is expected this week following a high-profile trial into the death of de Menezes, who was shot seven times by firearms officers after being mistaken for a terrorist. Close friends of Blair believe a spate of negative publicity against him stems from an 'orchestrated campaign' designed to undermine his position as the trial nears its end. Len Duval, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said last week that he believed there was an attempt to destabilise Blair and condemned the 'spiteful' hate campaign seemingly concocted to oust him from office. Sources close to the commissioner state that his tenure as head of the Yard will continue regardless of the verdict. 'It is also worth remembering that it is the office of the commissioner, not the commissioner himself, that is on trial,' said one. Closing speeches began last Friday, with a lawyer for the police saying that de Menezes was killed because he acted like a suicide bomber. He died at Stockwell underground station after being wrongly identified as Hussain Osman, one of the terrorists who tried to bomb the London transport system 24 hours earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
