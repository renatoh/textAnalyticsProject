In a distant future where interplanetary travel is commonplace, construction worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) pines for a trip to Mars, but his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) isn\u2019t interested. So instead he goes to a mysterious neurosurgery company that promises to implant a vivid memory of a glorious trip to Mars in his mind at a fraction of the real-world price. It all goes horribly wrong. This wildly successful movie laid the foundations for The Matrix and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, though time has not been kind to the pre-CGI future-world sets, and occasionally there\u2019s a bit of a Lew Grade look to the whole thing. Never mind. It\u2019s still a guilty pleasure \u2013 though the guilt quotient is a bit higher \u2013 and that\u2019s down to the still-extraordinary presence of the massively gym-built Arnold who somehow doesn\u2019t date: still postmodern and post-Earthling after all these years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
