Investigators said they based the new charges on a letter allegedly written by Frein, 31, to his parents, where he calls for a government revolution. He also told state police in an interview after his arrest that he killed trooper Bryon Dickson to \u201cwake people up\u201d. \u201cThere is so much wrong and on so many levels only passing through the crucible of another revolution can get us back the liberties we once had,\u201d Frein said in the letter. \u201cI do not pretend to know what the revolution will look like or even if it would be successful.\u201d The letter was initially created in late December 2013 and was found on a thumb drive investigators obtained in their search, according to the criminal complaint. \u201cTension is high at the moment and the time seems right for a spark to ignite a fire in the hearts of men,\u201d Frein said. \u201cWhat I have done has not been done before and it felt like it was worth a try.\u201d Frein appeared by video conference at the hearing with judge Shannon L Muir. The terrorism charges are for trying to \u201cinfluence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion\u201d and \u201caffect the conduct of a government\u201d. Frein is accused of killing Dickson in a 12 September ambush at the rural police barracks. Trooper Alex Douglass was also shot and wounded in the attack. This week, Douglass was moved from a rehabilitation facility to a New York City hospital for additional care. In October, US marshals captured Frein in an abandoned plane hangar in the Poconos Mountains. Officials said they surprised Frein during a sweep of the area, and that he kneeled and put his hands up after being approached by US marshals. More than 1,000 law enforcement officials were called in for the search which covered a densely wooded portion of the Poconos and brought life in the region to a standstill in the immediate days after Frein was announced as a suspect. \u201cI do not have a death wish but I know the odds,\u201d Frein said. \u201cI tried my best to do this thing without getting identified, but if you are reading this then I was not successful.\u201d In the letter, he also outlined his requests for burial in the case that he died. He asked to be buried in a wood coffin without lead lining, and for his parents to light a candle in the local Russian or Greek Orthodox church \u201cfrom time to time\u201d. Frein said: \u201cYou guys are great parents, I am just not a good son.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
