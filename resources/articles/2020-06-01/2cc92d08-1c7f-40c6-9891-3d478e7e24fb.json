Our coverage continues here Again on the China travel warning regarding Australia, Australian opposition spokesman for housing Jason Clare, told the ABC there had been a \u201cspike in racist abuse\u201d but said Australia is one of the safest countries in the world. \u201cThe borders are shut. They\u2019ll probably be shut for some time until we\u2019ve got a treatment or a vaccine. But I\u2019m sure I speak on behalf of all of the tourist operators up and down and right across Australia when I say that we want to get tourists back when it\u2019s safe to do so. So I hope that the government is working with the Chinese government to ensure that when we can open the border again, we can get Chinese tourists back.9:36 AM Government MP Jason Falinski said the relationship with China was \u201cstrained\u201d and there had been unfortunate incidents in Australia, and it was something Australia and China needed to resolve. One Australian senator, Rex Patrick from one of the minor parties - Centre Alliance, has responded to the China news, calling for a parliamentary inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China. California governor Gavin Newsom has said film and TV productions can resume from June 12 if local health officials approve. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the World Health Organization (WHO) unless it stops being a \u201cpartisan political organisation.\u201d In comments to journalists broadcast on CNN Brasil, Bolsonaro also said hydroxychloroquine \u201cis back\u201d after \u201csham\u201d studies regarding its efficacy were retracted. Bolsonaro has touted the drug as a treatment for the novel coronavirus despite a lack of scientific evidence about its effectiveness. The Lancet paper that halted global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 because of fears of increased deaths was retracted on Thursday after a Guardian investigation found inconsistencies in the data. In New York, the Associated Press reports that arrests from a week of protests have started to put a strain on the city\u2019s justice system amid the Covid-19 pandemic. There have been well over 2,000 arrests as police seek to impose order across the city. Public defenders say too many of those arrested have been detained for too long in cramped and unsanitary conditions while authorities figure who should receive summonses for minor violations and go free, or be charged in criminal complaints and face arraignments remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. The backlog prompted The Legal Aid Society to file a lawsuit demanding the New York police department release people held in violation of a requirement to get them in front of a judge within 24 hours, a situation that one defense lawyer said \u201cappears to be designed to retaliate against New Yorkers protesting police brutality.\u201d Patricia Miller, who heads the city\u2019s Special Federal Litigation Division, called the allegation \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cexceptionally unfair\u201d. The NYPD and court system are \u201cworking within the confines of a pandemic and now suddenly called upon not only to secure orderly protesting, but also to address rioters who are committing burglaries, destroying private property, and assaulting fellow New Yorkers,\u201d Miller said. A council in England has \u201cstrongly\u201d advised its schools to delay wider reopening until at least June 22 over concerns about the R rate in the North West. Tameside Council\u2019s director of public health Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy has written to all headteachers following new data which suggested the reproductive rate of coronavirus is now around one in the region. The letter said: \u201cMembers of SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) and the Association of Directors of Public Health advised caution and concern about the too rapid easing of lockdown and the increased risk of a second pandemic wave. \u201cBalancing this concern, the national R number being between 0.7 to 1.0 and estimated at 0.73 in the North West and the importance of having our children back at school, I supported the limited increase in the number of children attending planned in the Borough from Monday 8th June. \u201cHowever information released at 2pm today estimates the R value is now above the critical value of 1 for the North West, at 1.01. \u201cBecause of this change in R, and despite the excellent work undertaken, I am therefore strongly advising all schools and childcare settings to delay wider opening until at least 22 June for us to be more assured that the rate of infection is reducing and R is firmly below 1.\u201d The council said the situation would be monitored and reviewed on a weekly basis. China\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism has advised the public to avoid traveling to Australia, citing racial discrimination and violence against the Chinese in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThere has been an alarming increase recently in acts of racial discrimination and violence against Chinese and Asians in Australia, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the ministry said in a statement reported by Reuters. It did not give any specific examples of such discrimination or violence. People of Asian origin have said they have been harassed since the outbreak of the coronavirus including in the United States. China issued a warning to tourists traveling there earlier this year after some said they were mistreated in connection with the outbreak. The front page of Friday\u2019s UK edition of The Guardian. Public trust in science may have been shaken by the publication of academic papers based on false data in leading medical journals, according to renowned infectious disease doctors and former World Health Organization advisers. The director of Australia\u2019s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Professor Sharon Lewin, said she and colleagues were \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the saga and said it should be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d in a global rush to publish studies about Covid-19. At a primary school in the Canadian province of Quebec, nine children have tested positive for Covid-19 out of a class of 11, health officials said. The class was small because the school has been operating at half capacity. Health officials confirm the school in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res had taken preventative measures, such as handwashing reminders and marking spaces on the floor to encourage social distancing. Primary schools opened across Quebec outside the city of Montreal on 11 May, despite the province being Canada\u2019s biggest coronavirus hotspot, with 52,398 total cases and 4,935 deaths currently recorded. Ontario, the site of Canada\u2019s second largest hotspot, has closed schools for the remainder of the school year. An IMF team has agreed a one-year, $5.2 billion financing package for Egypt to help the country alleviate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The IMF board must still approve the financing from the fund\u2019s Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which allows nations to circumvent the lengthy negotiations usually needed to secure a full economic assistance program. The new funding comes on top of $2.8 billion the IMF board approved a month ago, although at the time officials acknowledged that more help would be needed. Cairo requested the aid, known as a Standby Arrangement, to support its efforts \u201cto maintain macroeconomic stability amid the Covid-19 shock while continuing to advance key structural reforms,\u201d IMF mission chief Uma Ramakrishnan said in a statement. \u201cThis will safeguard the gains achieved by Egypt over the past three years and put the country on strong footing for sustained recovery as well as higher and more inclusive growth and job creation over the medium term,\u201d she said. It also will open the doors to financing from other lenders and help support job creation by the private sector. The IMF team held virtual negotiations with Egyptian officials on the terms of the package, which the fund\u2019s board is expected to approve in \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d she said. Egypt has suffered over 1,100 Covid-19 fatalities with over 31,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally. Wall Street surged on Friday after a strikingly upbeat May jobs report unexpectedly provided the clearest evidence yet that the US economy is headed for a quicker-than-anticipated recovery. The Dow Jones rose 829.16 points, or 3.15%, to 27,110.98, the S&amp;P gained 81.58 points, or 2.62%, to 3,193.93 and the Nasdaq added 198.27 points, or 2.06%, to 9,814.08. Joe Biden has argued that President Trump deserved no credit for the US jobs report which showed unemployment had dropped slightly to 13.3% from 14.7% a month earlier. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Trump had still failed to acknowledge how his response to the coronavirus pandemic had hampered the country\u2019s economy. \u201cHe has no idea the depth of the pain that so many people are still enduring. He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to step out of his own bunker, take a look around the consequences of his words and his actions.\u201d Biden added: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of American their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.\u201d More than a third of Americans misused cleaners and disinfectants to try to prevent infection by the coronavirus, according to a survey taken shortly after Donald Trump publicly asked whether injecting such products could treat Covid-19, reports Reuters. Washing food with bleach, using household cleaning or disinfectant products on bare skin, and intentionally inhaling or ingesting the products were some of the most commonly reported \u201chigh-risk\u201d practices in a 4 May online survey of 502 US adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. The survey\u2019s lead author said it was undertaken following a \u201csharp increase\u201d in calls to poison control centres. In late April, Trump asked scientists during one of his coronavirus task force briefings whether inserting disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with the virus might help clear the disease, horrifying health experts. Makers of household cleaners were compelled to urge people not to drink or inject their products. Some 39% of people surveyed reported intentionally engaging in at least one high-risk practice, including using bleach to clean food or misting the body with a disinfectant spray. Four per cent drank or gargled with diluted bleach solutions, soapy water or disinfectants. The World Health Organization has updated its stance on masks to curb the spread of Covid-19. People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot physically distance, according to new guidance from the WHO, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The UK became the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, as officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus had died. So far, 40,261 virus deaths have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest death toll behind the United States. Hydroxychloroquine does not work against Covid-19 and should not be given to any more hospital patients around the world, say the leaders of the biggest and best-designed trial of the drug. \u201cIf you are admitted to hospital, don\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine. It doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Martin Landray, deputy chief investigator of the Recovery trial and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University. There were 85 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Friday, down from 88 on Wednesday, while new infections leapt by 518, up from 177 within the last 24 hours. The majority of the new infections \u2013 402 \u2013 were in the worst affected Lombardy region. A judge in Australia banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police. New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. The environmental and economic impact of coronavirus in Europe can now be seen using satellite data provided by the European Space Agency. The ESA and the European Commission launched an internet-based programme that compares pollution levels during the health crisis with a baseline scenario, measures chlorophyll concentrations or illustrates economic parameters such as harvests. The Rapid Action Coronavirus Earth observation (RACE) dashboard uses the Copernicus Sentinel satellite network, partner company data and artificial intelligence to make an interactive map of Europe that compares current industrial and transport activity with that of previous years. The platform will \u201cmeasure the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and monitor post-lockdown recovery,\u201d it said. RACE tracks \u201ckey environmental parameters - such as air and water quality changes, economic and human activities including industry, shipping, construction, traffic, as well as agricultural productivity\u201d in 22 ESA member countries. Air pollution is monitored worldwide, as is the asparagus harvest near Berlin, air traffic in Barcelona, Mediterranean water quality or concentrations of chlorophyll in a chosen region. Satellite images are accompanied by various tables of information and commentary by specialists. Some indicators go back to 2014, and are to be updated through the end of this year, according to Yves-Louis Desnos, head of the ESA\u2019s Earth Observation Science and Applications Department. Saudi Arabia has announced a renewed lockdown in the city of Jeddah starting from Saturday to counter a new spike in coronavirus cases. \u201cAfter reviewing the epidemiological situation and the high occupancy rates of intensive care departments, it was decided to take strict health precautions in the city of Jeddah for two weeks\u201d, the health ministry said. The measures include a curfew running from 3 pm to 6 am, a suspension of prayers in mosques and a stay-at-home order for public and private sector workers in the Red Sea city whose airport serves Mecca pilgrims. After an easing of precautions in the kingdom in late May, the ministry said that strict measures could also soon return to Riyadh, which was \u201cwitnessing a continuous increase during the last days\u201d of critical cases of the pandemic. Saudi Arabia has declared almost 96,000 coronavirus infections and 642 deaths from the Covid-19 respiratory disease, the heaviest toll in the Gulf. It has suspended the year-round Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading to Islam\u2019s holiest cities. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year\u2019s hajj, scheduled for the end of July, but have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. Estonia has developed an app that could serve as a digital \u201cimmunity passport\u201d, allowing users with antibodies to show employers and others their reduced risk of spreading coronavirus. The Immuunsuspass (ImmunityPassport) app being tested out this month was developed by tech firms Transferwise and Guardtime in cooperation with health specialists for the Back to Work non-governmental organisation. \u201cThe app we\u2019ve created can provide necessary data to schools and employers to help them make decisions,\u201d TransferWise cofounder Taavet Hinrikus told AFP. \u201cHowever, before it\u2019s adopted for widespread use, we need to achieve a scientific consensus on COVID-19 immunity.\u201d The app allows users to access their COVID-19 test results for an hour after proving their identity. They can also share the results with others using a QR-code that expires after a minute. The developers say this ensures that the immunity results are up-to-date and protected against unauthorised sharing. In the future, users will also be able to access their vaccination data. The World Health Organization issued a warning in late April that there was \u201cnot enough evidence\u201d to give people \u201crisk-free certificates,\u201d but hours later appeared to backpedal with a modified statement. In the follow-up, WHO said it expected that people who are infected with COVID-19 \u201cwill develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection\u201d but added that \u201cwhat we don\u2019t yet know is the level of protection or how long it will last\u201d. Estonia, known as E-stonia, has made a name for itself as a trailblazer in technology over the years. It pioneered e-voting in 2005 and hosts NATO\u2019s elite cyber defence centre. On Sunday, the European Union will launch a humanitarian air bridge to support the fight against coronavirus in the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said. France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Yves le Drian, his Belgian counterpart Philippe Goffin and European commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarcic will travel to Kinshasa on the flight from Brussels. On Monday, they will meet president Felix Tshisekedi in the capital before travelling to the eastern city of Goma, in the troubled region on the border with Rwanda. More flights will carry at least 40 tonnes of aid such as water purifiers, and medical supplies. provided by the EU, governments and humanitarian agencies. So far, Africa has been spared the worst of the pandemic, with 4,755 deaths recorded and 170,286 cases compared to more than 180,000 deaths and two million cases in Europe. But poorer countries like the DRC would struggle to cope if the outbreak intensifies and Brussels has set aside 3.25 billion euros ($3.67 billion) in grants and 1.4 billion euros in loans to help countries through the crisis. The Chinese city of Wuhan has announced it had cleared all hospital cases of coronavirus where patients have shown symptoms. State newspaper Global Times said that \u201cthe last three Covid-19 patients in Wuhan have recovered and been discharged from hospital\u201d. However, China omits from its data any cases where patients have tested positive for Covid-19 but have not exhibited symptoms. It began recording these separately from 1 April. AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer drug Calquence has shown initial signs of helping hospitalised Covid-19 patients get through the worst of the disease, according to tests. Results from the preliminary research involving 19 patients, which was backed by the United States National Institutes of Health, encouraged the British drugmaker to explore the drug\u2019s new use in a wider clinical trial announced in April. Eleven patients had been on oxygen when they started the 10-14 day Calquence course and eight of them could afterwards be discharged, breathing independently, according to results in a paper co-authored by Astra\u2019s head of oncology research, Jose Baselga. Eight patients were on mechanical ventilation when they were put on Calquence, and four of them could be discharged, though one died of pulmonary embolism. \u201cThese patients were in a very unstable situation, they would have had a dire prognosis ... Within one to three days the majority of these patients got better in terms of ventilation and oxygen needs,\u201d Astra\u2019s Baselga told Reuters. Severe cases of Covid-19 are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system known as cytokine storm and initial research has brought Calquence, and other drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system, into play. Police in Kenya have been involved in the killing of 15 people since the country put a nighttime curfew in place in March to combat coronavirus, the policing oversight body said in a statement seen by AFP. The Independent Policing Oversight Body (IPOA) said it had received 87 complaints against police since the dusk to dawn curfew and heightened security measures were put in place on March 27. \u201cAfter preliminary investigations, 15 deaths and 31 incidents where victims sustained injuries have directly been linked to actions of police officers during the curfew enforcement.\u201d According to the statement, the complaints include deaths, shootings, harassment, assaults, robbery, inhumane treatment and sexual assault. Kenya\u2019s police force is often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings, especially in poor neighbourhoods. In April Human Right Watch accused the police of imposing the curfew in a \u201cchaotic and violent manner from the start\u201d, sometimes whipping, kicking and teargassing people to force them off the streets. \u201cPolice brutality isn\u2019t just unlawful; it is also counterproductive in fighting the spread of the virus,\u201d the rights watchdog said. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The World Health Organization has updated its stance on masks to curb the spread of Covid-19. People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot physically distance, according to new guidance from the WHO, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The UK became the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, as officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus had died. So far, 40,261 virus deaths have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest death toll behind the United States. Sweden reported another large rise in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, with the 1,056 positive tests reported by the public health agency marking the third day the country\u2019s caseload had increased by more than a thousand. Sweden has now recorded 42,939 cases of coronavirus, and 4,639 deaths. All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will need to wear face coverings from 15 June, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said. All hospital staff will also be required to wear surgical masks. He also made a plea for people to be mindful of attending protests over the death of George Floyd. A study linked vitamin K deficiency with Covid-19, after researchers found that patients who had died or been admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 have been found to be deficient in the vitamin, which is found in spinach, eggs and hard and blue cheeses. Covid-19\u2019s impact on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The surprise news follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. Economists were expecting a rise to as high as 20%. US billionaires gained half a trillion dollars in wealth during outbreak. Even as more than 42 million people have signed on as unemployed in the US, the country\u2019s billionaires have added half a trillion dollars to their combined wealth, according to a think tank report. During the 11 weeks from 18 March, when US lockdowns started, the wealth of America\u2019s richest people surged by over $565bn. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, saw his wealth increase by $36.2bn. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg was the second biggest beneficiary, increasing his net worth by $30.1bn. A judge in Australia banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police. New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. Police in Paris cited ongoing health risks related to the coronavirus pandemic as they banned a demonstration against police brutality planned to take place outside the city\u2019s US embassy on Saturday. Trouble broke out at another anti-police demonstration in the French capital on Wednesday. On Monday, more than half of Spain will enter the fourth and final phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation, the government announced. However, the 52% of Spaniards in the last stage will not include those in the Madrid region or the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two parts of the country hit hardest by Covid-19. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. I\u2019ll be back with you on Monday. Hydroxychloroquine does not work against Covid-19 and should not be given to any more hospital patients around the world, say the leaders of the biggest and best-designed trial of the drug, which experts will hope finally settle the question, writes Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor. \u201cIf you are admitted to hospital, don\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine,\u201d said Martin Landray, the deputy chief investigator of the Recovery trial and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Many countries have permitted emergency use of the drug for Covid-19 patients in hospitals, following claims from a few doctors, including Didier Raoult in France, that it was a cure and the ensuing clamour from the public. President Donald Trump backed the drug, saying it should be given to patients and later said he was personally taking it to protect himself from the virus. Landray said the hype should now stop. \u201cIt is being touted as a game-changer, a wonderful drug, a breakthrough. This is an incredibly important result because worldwide we can stop using a drug that is useless.\u201d The first results from the Recovery trial, which has been testing seven therapies for Covid-19, swiftly followed the retraction of a paper in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday night that claimed hydroxychloroquine was linked to an increased risk of death in Covid-19 patients. The authors of the paper withdrew it after the US company Surgisphere refused to cooperate with an independent audit of the data it had supplied for the study. A Guardian investigation had showed serious errors in the data and raised questions about Surgisphere and its CEO. The World Health Organization\u2019s eastern Mediterreanean office has tweeted a breakdown of coronavirus statistics from member states. The politicisation of the coronavirus crisis and the Brazilian government\u2019s deliberate \u201ctorpedoing\u201d of social distancing efforts has condemned South America\u2019s largest country to a historic tragedy that will most punish the poor, Brazil\u2019s most respected medical voice has said, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, in Rio de Janeiro. As Brazil\u2019s death toll surpassed that of Italy, Drauzio Varella told the Guardian that historians would be unkind to president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing international condemnation for his handling of the pandemic. \u201cI think history will ascribe to him a level of guilt that I really wouldn\u2019t want for myself,\u201d said Varella, an oncologist, author and broadcaster who is a household name thanks to decades of public health activism. Only two countries, the US and the UK, have lost more lives, and Brazil seems poised to overtake the latter. Brazil has confirmed 615,000 cases, second only to the US. \u201cBecause in Brazil we are already the third country in the world in terms of deaths, we will soon become the second, and we are going to come close to the level of mortality in the US, which has 330 million citizens \u2013 that\u2019s 60% larger than Brazil\u2019s population,\u201d predicted Varella. \u201cThe situation couldn\u2019t be worse. It just couldn\u2019t.\u201d The coronavirus crisis \u201cis not over\u201d and will not be \u201cuntil there is no virus anywhere in the world,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Friday, as it warned of \u201cupticks\u201d in some countries. The epicentre of the pandemic is currently in countries of central, south and north America, particularly the United States, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \u201cOn upticks (in cases), yes we have seen in countries around the world - I\u2019m not talking specifically about Europe - when the lockdowns ease, when the social distancing measures ease, people sometimes interpret this as \u2018OK, it\u2019s over\u2019,\u201d Harris told a UN briefing in Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s not over. It\u2019s not over until there is no virus anywhere in the world,\u201d she said. Referring to demonstrations since the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis 10 days ago, Harris said that protesters must take precautions. \u201cWe have certainly seen a lot of passion this week, we\u2019ve seen people who have felt the need to be out and to express their feelings,\u201d she added. \u201cWe ask them to remember still protect yourself and others.\u201d There were 85 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Friday, down from 88 on Wednesday, while new infections leapt by 518, up from 177 within the last 24 hours, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. The majority of the new infections \u2013 402 \u2013 were in the worst affected Lombardy region, according to the figures from the civil protection authority. Over 19,000 tests were carried out in Lombardy in a day, compared to 3,410 on Thursday. Since 18 May, people have been able to go to bars, restaurants and shops and since Wednesday they have been free to travel beyond their regions. The infection rate across Italy\u2019s 19 other regions has so far been steadily declining, with several registering zero daily cases. The number of people currently infected with the virus decreased by 1,453 to 36,976 on Friday. Italy has so far registered 234,531 coronavirus cases, including 33,774 deaths 163,781 recoveries. A major trial of hydroxychloroquine has found it has \u201cno benefit\u201d for patients hospitalised with the coronavirus, researchers said Friday, announcing they had stopped tests of the drug. The chief investigators in the Recovery trial, which is run by the University of Oxford and is testing a number of potential treatments for the new coronavirus, said in a statement: We have concluded that there is no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with Covid-19. We have therefore decided to stop enrolling participants to the hydroxychloroquine arm of the Recovery trial with immediate effect. We are now releasing the preliminary results as they have important implications for patient care and public health. Hydroxychloroquine, an old malaria and rheumatoid arthritis drug, has been touted by many, including the US president, Donald Trump, as a potential treatment or prophylactic for coronavirus infection. The announcement comes in the same week that the World Health Organization (WHO) restarted its trials of hydroxychloroquine after they were temporarily halted because of a now-retracted study in The Lancet medical journal. The UK became the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, as health officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus have died. So far, 40,261 deaths due to the virus have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest pandemic death toll behind the United States. The actual Covid-19 death toll is widely considered to be higher as the total only includes those who have tested positive for the virus. According to the department of health, 1,650 more people were recorded as testing positive for the coronavirus, pushing the country\u2019s total caseload up to 283,311. On Friday, leading medics and scientists called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to order a public inquiry to prepare Britain for a second wave of the coronavirus this winter, warning that many more will die unless the country improves its response. Universities and colleges will reopen in Zambia next week, more than two months after they were closed as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. On Friday the minister for higher education, Brian Mushimba, said classes would resume from 8 June, with graduating students who are writing final examinations the first to go back. Other students would have to continue with online learning for the time being, Mushimba was quoted as saying by China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency. Covid-19 preventative measures would still be mandatory, including instructions to students to bring their own face masks, hand sanitisers and soap with them to campus. Police in Paris cited ongoing health risks related to the coronavirus pandemic as they banned a demonstration against police brutality planned to take place outside the city\u2019s US embassy on Saturday, Reuters reports. Trouble broke out at another anti-police demonstration in the French capital on Wednesday. Thousands had turned up despite a police ban on the event in memory of Adama Traore, a 24-year old black Frenchman who died in a 2016 police operation which some have likened to Floyd\u2019s death. On Monday, more than half of Spain will enter the fourth and final phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation, the government announced on Friday, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. However, the 52% of Spaniards in the last stage will not include those in the Madrid region or the Barcelona metropolitan area - the two parts of the country hit hardest by Covid-19. Along with many other regions, they will instead proceed to the penultimate phase, in which groups of up to 15 people can meet. People living in areas in the final phase, such as Andaluc\u00eda, the Balearic islands and the Canary islands, can once again eat inside restaurants as long as social distancing is practised, while shops, cinemas and theatres can open at 50% capacity. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, appealed for people to continue to behave responsibly so that the progress made during the lockdown was not squandered, adding: \u201cThe virus is still around.\u201d On Wednesday, the Spanish congress approved a sixth and final extension of the state of emergency, which is now set to end on June 22. Spain is due to reopen to foreign tourists from 1 July. People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask, writes Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor. The UK may have to rethink its advice following the significant change of stance by the WHO, which until now has been reluctant to advocate the wearing of masks by the public because of limited evidence that they offer protection. On Thursday, UK ministers announced it would be mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport from 15 June, but these coverings can be simply T-shirts or scarves. The new WHO guidance, announced on Friday, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used. The fashion question de nos jours would have been unimaginable four months ago,. Namely: how do I quickly find a face mask that does not scare my children or make me look like Bane in the Dark Knight Rises? Clearly the use of face masks is primarily a public health issue, and not a style one writes Hannah Marriott, the Guardian\u2019s fashion editor. But it would be better if your face mask \u2013 your de facto first impression for the next who-knows-how-long \u2013 did not make you feel any weirder than you already do. In the US, Donald Trump is giving a press conference to celebrate the unexpectedly good unemployment news there. You can follow that live on our US live blog here: Figures released today showed Covid-19\u2019s devastating assault on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The latest tally follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. In February the unemployment rate was just 3.5%. Some had predicted an increase in unemployment to about 20% today. Ireland is accelerating the relaxation of lockdown restrictions by expanding the travel limit and reopening shops, playgrounds, libraries and other facilities from Monday. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, struck an upbeat tone in Ireland\u2019s fight against Covid-19 by quoting Samwise Gamgee, a hobbit in Lord of the Rings. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.\u201d The announcement on Friday came amid a sharp fall in new cases - fewer than a hundred each day for the past 12 days \u2013 and evidence the reproduction number remains well below 1. Some business leaders, politicians and commentators had voiced concern that the lockdown exit strategy was too slow and conservative. Varadkar said the roadmap will be speeded up and shortened from five to four phases. \u201cSummer is not lost and this can be a summer of hope if we keep the virus at bay.\u201d From Monday, the start of the second phase, all retail stores can reopen, but with staggered opening times. The 5km travel limit will expand to let people travel within their county or up to 20km from home, whichever is greater. Groups of up to 6 people will be able to interact indoors or outdoors as long as they keep at least 2m apart. Groups of up to 15 can meet for outdoor sporting activities. Those aged over 70 or medically vulnerable can receive a small number of visitors at home. Public libraries, playgrounds, outdoor camps for children, marts and greyhound racing can also resume. Up to 25 people will be allowed to attend funerals. Hairdressers, beauticians and barbers must wait until 20 July to reopen. In earlier, more sombre pandemic-related speeches Varadkar quoted Seamus Heaney. On Friday he quoted Cicero before channeling JRR Tolkien. Patients who have died or been admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 have been found to be deficient in a vitamin found in spinach, eggs and hard and blue cheeses, raising hopes that dietary change might be one part of the answer to combating the disease, writes Daniel Boffey in Brussels. Researchers studying patients who were admitted to the Canisius Wilhelmina hospital in the Dutch city of Nijmegen have extolled the benefits of vitamin K after discovering a link between deficiency and the worst coronavirus outcomes. Covid-19 causes blood clotting and leads to the degradation of elastic fibres in the lungs. Vitamin K, which is ingested through food and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, is key to the production of proteins that regulate clotting and can protect against lung disease. The Dutch researchers are now seeking funding for a clinical trial, but Dr Rob Janssen, a scientist working on the project, said that in light of the initial findings he would encourage a healthy intake of vitamin K, except to those on blood-clotting medications such as warfarin. He said: \u201cWe are in a terrible, horrible situation in the world. We do have an intervention which does not have any side effects, even less than a placebo. There is one major exception: people on anti-clotting medication. It is completely safe in other people.\u201d The EU has pledged to lift border controls inside its territory by the end of the month while extending a ban on travellers coming from outside the bloc until 1 July. The extension of the ban on non-essential travel by foreign nationals into the EU\u2019s border free-travel zone was approved by the EU\u2019s 27 home affairs ministers on Friday by video conference. The travel ban, which had been due to expire on 15 June, applies to all non-EU countries, with exemptions for citizens from EU-associated countries \u2013 Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. British travellers also remain exempt from the ban but face two-week quarantine requirements from some European governments. The EU\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told journalists that \u201calmost all member states\u201d had expressed \u201ca strong preference for a further but short prolongation\u201d of the travel ban. Countries had agreed a \u201cgradual and strictly coordinated lifting\u201d of the restriction from July, she said. The commander of US forces in Japan has accused China of using the coronavirus crisis as a cover for a surge in naval activity to push territorial claims in the South China Sea. In a telephone interview with the Reuters news agency, Lieutenant General Kevin Schneider said there had been a surged of activity by China, with navy ships, coast guard vessels and a naval militia of fishing boats in harassing vessels in waters claimed by Beijing. \u201cThrough the course of the Covid crisis we saw a surge of maritime activity,\u201d he told Reuters in a phone interview. He said Beijing had also increased its activity in the East China Sea, where it has a territorial dispute with Japan. Beijing\u2019s increased level of activity would likely continue, predicted Schneider: \u201cI don\u2019t see troughs, I see plateaus,\u201d he said. China says its maritime activities in the area are peaceful. The press office at the Chinese embassy in Tokyo was not immediately available to comment outside of normal business hours, Reuters said. Japan hosts the biggest concentration of US forces in Asia, including an aircraft carrier strike group, an amphibious expeditionary force and fighter squadrons. In addition to defending Japan, they are deployed to deter China from expanding its influence in the region, including in the South China Sea. Peru is beginning the second phase of its economic reopening on Friday, even as its ongoing coronavirus outbreak showed little signs of slowing, with 4,284 new confirmed cases reported on Thursday. The president, Martin Vizcarra, announced the second phase of lockdown easing on Thursday, after his council of ministers approved a presidential decree calling for the restart of economic activity. Peru is the second-worst affected country in Latin America, the region which the World Health Organisation has said is now at the centre of the global coronavirus pandemic. In spite of an early and strictly enforced lockdown it has so far reported a total of 183,198 coronavirus infections and 5,031 deaths from Covid-19 - 137 of which were reported on Thursday. The economic shutdown has caused widespread hardship in Peru, where much of the population survives from working in the informal economy. Vizcarra\u2019s plan is for 80% of the country\u2019s economy to resume operation from Friday. During lockdown, the economy has been operating at 50% capacity, which Vizcarra said was \u201cnot enough to sustain 100%\u201d of the country\u2019s needs. \u201cWe want to raise it to 100% and then even see growth on top of that,\u201d Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted Vizcarra as saying. Among the sectors scheduled to return to work from Friday were small and medium-size mining enterprises, feed-making for animals, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, footwear production, printing, and medical tools manufacturing and repair, services including legal and accounting firms, architecture and engineering companies, as well as some retail. Sweden reported another large rise in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, with the 1,056 positive tests reported by the public health agency marking the third day the country\u2019s caseload had increased by more than a thousand. While a bumper report of 2,214 cases on Wednesday was partly explained by a lab releasing a backlog of results, on Thursday, after another 1,084 cases were reported, the public health agency said the rise in cases could not wholly be explained by increased testing. The agency\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told a news conference on Thursday that the increases in new cases was seen primarily in Western Sweden and among younger people. Sweden has now recorded 42,939 cases of coronavirus, and 4,639 deaths after another 77 deaths were reported on Friday - not all of which will have occurred within the past 24 hours due to reporting delays from local areas. The death rate remains well below a peak reached towards the end of April. The Swedish approach to tackling the coronavirus has been described as \u201clight touch\u201d, with shops, gyms and restaurants allowed to stay open, and the public simply asked to avoid non-essential travel or venturing out if unwell. Lockdown sceptics who thought that the kinds of lockdown measures seen elsewhere in Europe had gone to far have hailed the strategy. But criticism has been mounting after the per capita death rate in the country far exceeded its close neighbours. Earlier this week, Sweden\u2019s coronavirus death rate surpassed that of France. However, it remains well below the UK, Italy, Spain and Belgium - all countries which have enforced curbs on freedoms in attempts to contain the spread of the disease. Covid-19\u2019s devastating assault on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs, writes Dominic Rushe, for the Guardian US, in New York. The surprise news follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. Economists had been expecting a rise to as high as 20%. But the rate is still historically high. In February the unemployment rate was just 3.5%. A decade\u2019s worth of gains made in the labor market since the last recession have been erased in just three months. All 50 states have now begun easing quarantine restrictions and the pace of this unprecedented hollowing has now slowed as some have returned to work but uncertainties remain. Weekly unemployment claims have plummeted from a frightening peak of 6.6m in April to 1.9m last week but Jason Reed, a professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said the numbers were still huge. He worried America is now witnessing a shift from temporary to permanent layoffs. While the unemployment rate remains well above the 10% peak in the last recession, president Donald Trump was quick to hail victory. \u201cGreat going President Trump (kidding but true)!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Mosques, churches and other places of worship reopened in Jakarta for the first time in nearly three months on Friday, as the Indonesian capital loosened a partial lockdown, AFP reports. Jakarta\u2019s governor announced the easing of restrictions on Thursday, with offices, restaurants, shopping malls and tourist attractions also scheduled to reopen in the coming weeks. While mosques have remained open in some other parts of Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority country, for many residents of Jakarta, a megacity that is home to about 30 million people, it was their first time attending Friday prayers since mid-March. Mohamad Fathi, 35, said he was \u201cfull of happiness\u201d at the news. \u201cIt cheered me up and satisfied my longing for mass prayers,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cI\u2019m very happy we\u2019re now allowed to return to pray.\u201d However, the weekly service was shorter than usual as part of efforts to lower the risk of COVID-19 infections, he said. Mosque-goers were also ordered to bring their own prayer mats and abide by social-distancing rules with temperature checks at the door. On Friday, Indonesia reported 703 new cases of coronavirus and 49 coronavirus-related deaths. There have now been a total of 29,521 infections in the country of 274 million people, and 1,770 deaths. US clothing retailer Gap has reported a quarterly loss of almost $1bn, after it had to close the vast majority of its stores worldwide during the coronavirus shutdown, writes Joanna Partridge, for the Guardian\u2019s business desk. The company, based in San Francisco, made a loss of $932m (\u00a3738m) for the three months to 2 May, compared with $227m profit during the same period in 2019. The retailer, know for its denim, chinos and T-shirts, included in its quarterly loss a $484m write-down on its stores and operating lease assets, and a $235m charge on excess stock. Like many of its competitors, Gap has been left with mountains of seasonal clothing that it has not been able to sell while 90% of its global stores were temporarily forced to close during lockdown. Retailers of non-essential goods, such as clothing, have been significantly affected by store closures across many territories, which were designed to slow the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic triggered several high-profile retail insolvencies in the US, including fashion chain JCrew, and department store chains JC Penney and Neiman Marcus. The group, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic brands, said that customers were focused on buying casual clothes while staying at home, hitting sales at Banana Republic, which offers more workwear. For the first time in 75 years, there will be no D-day veterans on the beaches of Normandy to mark the anniversary of the Allied landings on Saturday, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. Official commemorations have been cancelled except for a limited gathering of representatives from nine countries \u2013 including the British ambassador to France \u2013 for a short ceremony. A year after the fanfare of the 75th anniversary of the 1944 landings that marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany, many of this year\u2019s events will be relayed by livestream to the dwindling number of elderly former soldiers who took part in Operation Overlord. A website will transmit events commemorating the day when 150,000 troops swarmed ashore at strategic points along 50 miles of France\u2019s west coastline. That day in 1944 they were met with a hail of machine gun fire and bombardments, leaving 10,000 casualties, among them 2,500 dead. Saturday\u2019s commemorations will include a flypast by the French air force\u2019s air acrobatic team, the Patrouille de France. \u201cSince 1945, every year we have paid homage to the men who fought for our freedom,\u201d said Jean-Marc Lefranc, president of the Comit\u00e9 du D\u00e9barquement (D-day Landing Committee). \u201cThis year, for the first time it will not be open to the public.\u201d More than 3,000 shops and markets across Pakistan were closed down on Friday in a series of raids for violating social distancing regulations, the Associated Press reports, as the country drew close to 90,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. On Friday, health authorities reported 68 more coronavirus-related deaths, raising its overall death toll to 1,838. Meanwhile 4,896 more people tested positive in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day rise in infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 89,249. The pace of the virus\u2019s spread has increased since the prime minister, Imran Khan, eased lockdown measures in May. Doctors are now bracing for a surge of Covid-19 patients and some hospitals are already turning back those with mild infection, asking them to quarantine themselves at home. Critics say Khan eased restrictions prematurely, but the government has blamed the public for the spread in infections, saying people failed to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Despite his wealth having increased by $14bn in the past 11 weeks (see previous post), the billionaire Elon Musk is still cranky enough for a Twitter spat with a rival billionaire. On Thursday, Musk tweeted Jeff Bezos to call for the break up of Bezos\u2019s online retail empire, Amazon, in the latest row over censorship related to the coronavirus outbreak. The Tesla chief executive lashed out after an author complained on social media about being unable to self-publish a book entitled \u201cUnreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates.\u201d \u201cThis is insane @JeffBezos,\u201d Musk tweeted at Bezos. \u201cTime to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!\u201d According to Reuters, Amazon had no comment on Musk\u2019s call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to allow the book\u2019s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said. According to preview text on the Amazon website, Berenson\u2019s book \u201cprovides a counterweight to media hysteria about coronavirus.\u201d Musk has been a prominent lockdown sceptic, lashing out on Twitter about shelter-at-home restrictions and trying to reopen his factories even as orders remained in place. They are this season\u2019s must-have accessory. Surgical masks are in demand all over the world as people take precautions to avoid catching and spreading the coronavirus. Now the environmental impact of these single-use, disposable items is beginning to be felt, according to this news report from the French news agency AFP. A judge in Australia has banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police to stop it taking place. New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. Under restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus, outdoor gatherings in Sydney are restricted to 10 people, while up to 50 people can go to funerals, places of worship, restaurants, pubs and cafes. \u201cI don\u2019t diminish the importance of the issues and no one would deny them in normal circumstances,\u201d Fagan was reported as saying by the Associated Press. \u201cNo one denies them that but we\u2019re talking about a situation of a health crisis.\u201d His decision came after thousands of people indicated they would join the rally in in Australia\u2019s largest city on Saturday afternoon to remember George Floyd, the victim of a police killing in Minneapolis last week, and to protest against the deaths of indigenous Australians in custody. The state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said organisers initially proposed a protest far smaller rally. She said protesters could not guarantee social distancing protocols would be followed. \u201cAll of us have given up so much and worked so hard to make sure we get on top of the virus,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters. Restaurants are opening, parks are full and people are getting back to work: parts of Europe, Asia and much of the Middle East are enjoying the benefits of flattened coronavirus curves. Meanwhile, parts of the US, India and Latin America are still recording thousands of new cases every day. The first wave of the coronavirus is not over. The future shape of the pandemic will be decided both by human action, in the form of social distancing, testing and other traditional methods of disease control, and also several unanswered questions about the nature of the virus itself. Experts say there are several possibilities, Michael Safi, the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent, reports. Even as more than 42 million people have signed on as unemployed in the US, the country\u2019s billionaires have added half a trillion dollars to their combined wealth, according to a thinktank report. During the 11 weeks from 18 March, when US lockdowns started, the wealth of America\u2019s richest people surged by over $565bn, the Institute for Policy Studies calculated in a report published on Thursday. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has benefited the most, as orders at his online delivery service soared, with his wealth increasing by an eye-watering $36.2bn. Mark Zuckerberg was the second biggest beneficiary, increasing his net worth by $30.1bn. Even Bill Gates, who has positioned himself as global health saviour by backing a number of Covid-19 vaccine projects, has ended up $11.8bn better off. Jeff Bezos \u2013 up $36.2bn Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 up $30.1bn Elon Musk \u2013 up $14.1bn Sergey Brin \u2013 up $13.9bn Larry Page \u2013 up $13.7bn Steve Ballmer \u2013 up $13.3bn MacKenzie Bezos \u2013 up $12.6bn Michael Bloomberg \u2013 up $12.1bn Bill Gates \u2013 up $11.8bn Phil Knight \u2013 up $11.6bn Larry Ellison \u2013 up $8.5bn Warren Buffett \u2013 up $7.7bn Michael Dell \u2013 up $7.6bn Sheldon Adelson \u2013 up $6.1bn Chuck Collins, a co-author of the report, said: These statistics remind us that we are more economically and racially divided than at any time in decades. The number of new cases of coronavirus in Iran slid slightly from its new peak yesterday, with 2,886 more people in the country testing positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, according to the health ministry. On Thursday, Iran reported a new record in transmissions detected in a single day, suggesting that the country could be experiencing a second wave of the epidemic. The previous daily record in Iran, which was one of the first countries in the Middle East to be gripped by the disease, was 3,186 on 30 March. In spite of a steadily rising infection rate, authorities have been progressively lifting controls on shops, mosques, schools, offices and travel. The border with Turkey was also being opened for haulage traffic on Thursday. In his latest update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 63 more Iranians had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. There are currently 2,573 people in critical condition. So far, Jahanpour said, 129,741 people out of a total of 167,156 infected with the virus have recovered. More than 168,000 people have so far tested positive for the coronavirus in Africa \u2013 an increase of about 6,000 since Thursday \u2013 according to the latest figures circulated by the World Health Organization on Friday. After a couple of days\u2019 unexplained hiatus, the UN health agency\u2019s regional office for the continent has resumed its tweets giving the rundown of the latest figures from the 54 countries in Africa. Of the official confirmed cases so far, more than 73,000 people have so far recovered and 4,700 have died. This is Damien Gayle taking the reins now on the live blog, bringing you the latest headlines and news on the global coronavirus outbreak as it happens. If you have any comments, or tips or suggestions for coverage, please drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. That\u2019s it for me today. Thanks to those who got in touch with their comments and suggestions \u2013 I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle. Covid-19 deaths pass 390,000 worldwide. The number of confirmed deaths now stands at 391,439, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Meanwhile, known cases passed 6.6 million across the globe, with 6,651,047 currently confirmed. Brazil\u2019s death toll overtakes Italy\u2019s to become third highest worldwide. Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll passed that of Italy on Thursday, as the health ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. First Covid-19 case recorded among persecuted Rohingya in Myanmar. The 38-year-old man in Rakhine state had returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh, officials told Radio Free Asia. Rights groups are concerned about the squalid conditions in camps in Rakhine, where around 130,000 internally displaced Rohingya remain trapped. South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bringing the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region, where health services are under pressure. Covid-19 \u2018under control\u2019 in France, says government adviser. The head of the government\u2019s scientific advisory council, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, told France Inter radio: \u201cWe can reasonably say the virus is currently under control. The virus is still circulating, in certain regions in particular \u2026 but it is circulating slowly.\u201d Turkey cancels weekend lockdown after backlash. President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has cancelled a lockdown, announced late on Thursday, after a public backlash, but warned of a rise in the number of daily coronavirus cases. British pharma giant \u201con track\u201d to roll out 2bn vaccine doses if trials successful. AstraZeneca will begin rolling out the vaccine in September if ongoing trials prove successful, its chief executive said. The company is partnering with Oxford University, which has pioneered the vaccine, and is already manufacturing doses before seeking final regulatory approval once testing concludes in the coming months. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42m after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. Death of man after face mask arrest shines light on Mexican police brutality. Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police officers for not wearing a face mask in public. Video of the incident emerged on Wednesday, and shows the police officers with assault rifles forcing Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, into a police pickup truck as bystanders plead for his release. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, will hold a video conference on Thursday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, economic policy and international issues, a German government spokesman has said. Malaysia has reported 19 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the cumulative total to 8,266 infections. The health ministry also reported its first death in two weeks, raising the number of fatalities to 116. Earlier on Friday, Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, unveiled an additional economic stimulus package worth around $8.2bn in an effort to revitalise industries badly hit by the pandemic. Mining sites in Canada, the US and around the world have become hotspots for the spread of coronavirus, and approximately 4,000 mine workers in 18 countries have tested positive, according to a report by an international coalition of non-profit groups. The report links mining sites to virus outbreaks in several Indigenous and remote communities. In a separate statement more than 330 organisations around the world called mining \u201cone of the most polluting, deadly, and destructive industries\u201d and accused the industry of ignoring the threats of pandemic and using it to weaken regulations. \u201cWe reject the central claim that mining represents an essential service,\u201d it reads. The mining industry pushed governments to declare them \u201cessential\u201d and many continue to operate throughout the pandemic in the US and Canada, said Kirsten Francescone of MiningWatch Canada, one of the non-profit groups that authored the report. Mine workers and members of nearby Indigenous and remote rural communities are at grave risk. At least 45 infected workers from a fly-in, fly-out work camp housing thousands at Exxon\u2019s Imperial Oil Kearl Lake oil sands mine project in northern Alberta flew home in mid-April unknowingly spreading the virus in five Canadian provinces. This triggered an outbreak in a remote northern Saskatchewan Dene village, killing two elders, and in a long-term care home in British Columbia. The Kearl Lake outbreak has expanded to 107 cases as the mine continues to operate. In mid-May another Alberta oilsands operation reported an outbreak but Alberta government officials insist these operations must remain open to protect the economy, said Francescone. \u201cThese outbreaks are hardly surprising with mine workers living together in camps.\u201d The British pharma giant AstraZeneca is \u201con track\u201d to begin rolling out up to 2bn doses of a coronavirus vaccine in September if ongoing trials prove successful, its chief executive said on Friday. The company is partnering with Oxford University, which has pioneered the vaccine, and is already manufacturing doses before seeking final regulatory approval once testing concludes in the coming months. The AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot, told the BBC: So far we\u2019re still on track \u2026 we are starting to manufacture this vaccine right now, and we have to have it ready to be used by the time we have the results. Our present assumption is that we will have the data by the end of the summer, by August, so in September we should know whether we have an effective vaccine or not. The firm announced this week it had struck agreements with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, and the Serum Institute of India to double production capacity of the Covid-19 vaccine to 2bn doses. The partnership with the Indian institute \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturers \u2013 will help supply it to a large number of low- and middle-income countries. AstraZeneca has established separate supply chains for the vaccine in Europe, the United States, and India and is also looking at setting up production in China, Soriot said. He added AstraZeneca, which is undertaking the work on a non-profit basis, could lose money if trials prove disappointing. But he said the company was sharing the financial risk with organisations such as CEPI. \u201cWe\u2019re manufacturing indeed at risk \u2013 and that\u2019s the only way to have the vaccine ready to go if it works,\u201d he added. Oxford University began initial trials of its Covid-19 vaccine with hundreds of volunteers in April, and is now expanding them to 10,000 participants. It said last month they were \u201cprogressing very well\u201d. Researchers announced this week they would also start tests in mid-June in Brazil, the first country outside Britain to take part in the study, as the South American country\u2019s virus infection rate spirals while the UK\u2019s falls. French winemakers are to turn unsold wine into hand gel and ethanol to make room for this year\u2019s production, the country\u2019s farming agency has said. The government agency FranceAgriMer said around 3m hectolitres needed distilling as a result of lower sales during the coronavirus crisis. Winemakers have been hit by the closure of bars and restaurants in France and abroad. Exports to the US, which halved after the Trump administration introduced punitive 25% tariffs last October, fell further after the Covid-19 outbreak. FranceAgriMer said that from Friday, 33 distilleries had been authorised to collect 2m hectolitres of unsold wine to transform it into ethanol or hydro-alcoholic gel in order to free up room in vintners\u2019 caves for this year\u2019s production. The exceptional measure has been approved by Brussels, and the EU will finance the distillation, the agency added. Similar measures are being employed in Spain and Italy to deal with an excess of wine and to destroy young grapes. The alcohol produced through the distilling process will be used by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry and for the production of hand sanitising gel. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has cancelled a weekend lockdown announced late on Thursday after a public backlash, but warned of a rise in the number of daily coronavirus cases. On Thursday, Turkey\u2019s interior ministry announced the stay-at-home order in 15 cities to prevent the spread of the virus, continuing the country\u2019s policy of weekend lockdowns. In a series of tweets, Erdo\u011fan said the government had to impose the weekend lockdown after daily new Covid-19 cases rose from around 700 to nearly 1,000. \u201cHowever, the reactions we received from our people pushed us to re-evaluate the decision,\u201d and the lockdown is now revoked, he said, urging citizens to follow social distancing and hygiene measures. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry has confirmed three new coronavirus deaths and 244 more infections, the lowest single-day increase in cases in two weeks. The ministry said total deaths had reached 987 while confirmed cases had risen to 20,626. There are 4,330 patients who have recovered. A professional rugby union team that set off for an away match on 23 February have still not made it home, the BBC have reported. The Manuma Samoa team set off for a match in Perth, Australia over 100 days ago, and were forced to quarantine in New Zealand on their way home - where they ended up stuck when the country closed its borders. They lived in a church compound in Auckland for three months, with 20 players sharing one room. \u201cWhen we arrived in New Zealand it was summer,\u201d the team\u2019s video analyst, Hari Junior Narayan, told the BBC. \u201cWhen we left it was winter.\u201d The squad is now back in Samoa, halfway through a two-week quarantine, after which they will finally be reunited with their families. \u201cMy daughter is four months old,\u201d said Narayan. \u201cThe last time I saw her, she was one month, so I\u2019ve missed a lot.\u201d All air traffic at Israel\u2019s principal airport was shut down on Friday after workers walked off the job to demand compensation for wages lost due to the coronavirus crisis. Global demand for air travel has plummeted amid the pandemic and Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv, put about 2,500 airport workers on unpaid leave in early March. The Israel Airports Authority\u2019s workers\u2019 union has demanded the country negotiate a compensation package with airport workers. \u201cThe workers that were placed on unpaid leave have now stopped receiving unemployment benefits. We need the government to find a solution,\u201d the union spokeswoman Gali Gabbay said. Most flights at the airport had already been halted due to the pandemic, save for a handful of daily passenger and cargo services. The workers\u2019 strike will affect 37 flights on Friday, 17 outbound and 20 inbound, the airport said. It did not say how many were passenger or cargo flights. Israel has not said when it will end Covid-19 border restrictions. A US aircraft carrier ship, whose captain was removed for scathing remarks about a coronavirus outbreak onboard, has returned to service in the Pacific Ocean, authorities said. Brett Crozier lost his command in early April as punishment for the leak of a letter he sent to superiors seeking tougher action against the spread of Covid-19 on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Hailed as a hero by his crew, Crozier\u2019s case is now being reconsidered by the US navy, which has recommended his reinstatement to the defense secretary, Mark Esper. The massive carrier was sidelined for about 10 weeks because of the outbreak, which infected a fifth of its 5,000 sailors, but set sail again from the US Pacific territory of Guam on Thursday, the ship\u2019s public affairs office said. It had a famous navy battle cry \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up The Ship\u201d \u2013 flying from the port yardarm. The ship returned to the US 7th Fleet area of operations to provide maritime security with new social distancing rules including staggered mealtimes, the navy said. \u201cWe have returned Theodore Roosevelt to sea as a symbol of hope and inspiration,\u201d said the new Captain, Carlos Sardiello. Thailand is positioning itself as a trusted destination for international tourists after travel restrictions ease, capitalising on its relative success in containing the coronavirus outbreak, industry officials say. The south-east Asian country, the first to report a virus case outside of China, wants to build on its reputation and remake its popular image as a destination for big tour groups. \u201cAfter Covid eases, we plan to refresh the country\u2019s image to a trusted destination where tourists will have peace of mind,\u201d Tanes Petsuwan, the Tourism Authority of Thailand\u2019s (TAT) deputy governor for marketing and communications, told Reuters. The campaign, to be launched later in the year, will be aimed at young, affluent travellers from places that are considered low-risk such as China, South Korea and Taiwan, Tanes said. It will highlight scenic beaches and parks, part of a \u201ctourism bridge\u201d that could emerge in Asia including Hong Kong and Japan. The government has rolled out a health certification system for hotels and restaurants so that travellers can be reassured. South-east Asia\u2019s second-largest economy has so far reported just over 3,100 cases and 58 deaths - far less than other major regional economies, except for Vietnam. Local transmission has waned, with the last recorded case on 25 May. The tourism industry, which accounts for 12% of the economy, collapsed after the outbreak escalated. Thailand welcomed 39.8 million foreign tourists last year but projects as few as 14 million for 2020. Thailand has banned international flights until at least 30 June, and foreign tourists aren\u2019t expected until later in the year. In the meantime, the government is drawing up a stimulus package to promote domestic tourism from July to October. But when international travel resumes, Thailand will promote the \u201ctrust\u201d concept, as hotels emphasise measures they are taking for safety and offer special packages. Central Plaza Hotel, which manages 46 hotels and resorts across Thailand, will seal rooms once they are cleaned and disinfected so guests will be confident, the deputy CEO Markland Blaiklock told Reuters. \u201cWe may limit occupancy at 50% on some properties so guests experience social distancing that they are comfortable with,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s unclear if travellers will be at ease before a coronavirus vaccine is available, which experts say is at least a year away. The Czech Republic said it would fully open borders with Austria and Germany, as well as travel with Hungary, on Friday, 10 days earlier than planned, almost three months after they were shut to curb coronavirus. Travellers will be free to enter from noon (10:00 GMT) without submitting a negative virus test or going into quarantine. Czechs still require people from countries including Britain and Sweden to submit negative test results before being allowed in. Having closed all borders on 16 March to stem coronavirus infections, the Czechs reopened the Slovakia frontier on Thursday and lifted all travel restrictions with their neighbour. Officials said on Monday they would open the border for the citizens of \u201csafe\u201d countries, including their neighbours but also Switzerland, Finland and the Baltic states, from 15 June. \u201cWe have brought the opening forward with these countries,\u201d the prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, told reporters, referring to Austria, Germany and Hungary, without explaining why the move was being made earlier than planned. The government also announced on Monday that Czechs would be free to travel to less-safe countries including Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain. But foreigners arriving from these countries would have to submit a negative test result upon entry, just like those from the least safe countries - Britain and Sweden. Czechs returning from Britain and Sweden will have to provide negative tests too. As of Friday morning, the Czech Republic had registered almost 9,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 326 deaths, in a population of 10.7 million people. Surgical masks are washing up in growing quantities on the shores of Hong Kong, a city that has overwhelmingly embraced face coverings to fight the coronavirus. Conservationists say the masks are adding to already alarmingly high levels of plastic waste in the waters around the finance hub. \u201cThe single use plastic mask is just another additional burden that we are leaving behind for the future generations on the beach,\u201d Gary Stokes, co-founder of OceansAsia, told AFP. During a recent visit, conservationists counted and removed 70 masks from a 100 metre stretch of beach. A week later, another 30 masks had washed up. \u201cEver since society started wearing masks, the cause and effects of it are now being seen on the beaches,\u201d Stokes said. Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million inhabitants produce six million tonnes of waste each year, only around 30% of it recycled. Even before the coronavirus emerged, residents often wore face masks on the daily commute, especially during the winter flu season. But the emergence of the deadly Covid-19 disease has made mask wearing near ubiquitous. A growing number of companies are now offering reusable masks and the government has also launched an initiative to send all residents a fabric mask that can be washed. But disposable masks remain by far the most popular choice. Stokes said: What I\u2019ll be waiting to see is when we\u2019ll get a dead porpoise or dolphin washed out with masks inside their stomach. Obviously these are another thing that enters into the marine environment and could be mistaken for food. The Covid-19 pandemic is now \u201cunder control\u201d in France, the head of the government\u2019s scientific advisory council has said, as the country cautiously lifts a lockdown imposed in March. Jean-Francois Delfraissy told France Inter radio: We can reasonably say the virus is currently under control. The virus is still circulating, in certain regions in particular \u2026 but it is circulating slowly. Delfraissy, an immunologist, and his colleagues were appointed to the coronavirus advisory panel as authorities sought to contain an outbreak that has killed more than 29,000 people in France. The number of daily deaths has fallen off, however, with just 44 reported by the health ministry on Thursday. Delfraissy said around 1,000 new cases were currently being reported in France per day, down from around 80,000 in early March, before the nationwide stay-at-home orders and business closures were issued. In its latest summary of findings published on Thursday, the Sante Publique France health agency estimated that the country had 151,325 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of 2 June, when restaurants across France were allowed to reopen. But it cautioned that at the height of the outbreak, patients with suspected coronavirus infections were not systematically tested, meaning the actual number of cases exceeds the official estimate. Russia has reported 8,726 new cases of Covid-19, pushing the total number of infections in the country to 449,834. Officials said 144 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the official nationwide death toll to 5,528. An influential medical journal article that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in Covid-19 patients was retracted on Thursday, adding further controversy to the drug championed by US president Donald Trump. Three of the authors of the article retracted it, citing concerns about the quality and veracity of data in the study, following a Guardian investigation into the data and US company Surgisphere which provided it. The anti-malarial drug has been controversial in part due to support from Trump, as well as implications of the study published in British journal The Lancet last month, which led several Covid-19 studies to be halted. The three authors said Surgisphere would not transfer the dataset for an independent review and they \u201ccan no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources\u201d. The fourth author of the study, Dr Sapan Desai, chief executive of Surgisphere, declined to comment on the retraction. The Lancet said on Thursday it \u201ctakes issues of scientific integrity extremely seriously, and there are many outstanding questions about Surgisphere and the data that were allegedly included in this study\u201d. It said institutional reviews of Surgisphere\u2019s research collaborations were urgently needed. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine that relied on Surgisphere data and shared the same lead author, Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra, was retracted for the same reason. The observational study published in The Lancet on 22 May said it looked at 96,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients, some treated with the decades-old malaria drug. It claimed that those treated with hydroxychloroquine or the related chloroquine had higher risk of death and heart rhythm problems than patients who were not given the medicines. The World Health Organization, which paused hydroxychloroquine trials after The Lancet study was released, said on Wednesday it was ready to resume trials, and dozens of other trials have resumed or are in process. The study\u2019s lead author, professor Mehra, said in a statement: I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions - both directly and indirectly - I am truly sorry. Many scientists voiced concern about the study, which had already been corrected last week because some location data was wrong. Nearly 150 doctors signed an open letter to The Lancet calling the article\u2019s conclusions into question and asking to make public the peer review comments that preceded publication. The episode highlights how studies to prevent and treat the virus are being conducted at unprecedented speed while garnering high levels of attention that could give findings unwarranted weight. Singapore has confirmed another 261 coronavirus cases, the city-state\u2019s smallest increase in nearly two months, taking its tally to 37,183. The lower number of cases was partly due to the fact that fewer swab-tests were conducted, the health ministry said. Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new coronavirus cases as around 60% of tests over the last 24 hours came back positive, with a continued surge of transmission in Kabul and record high in Helmand. According to the latest update, the health ministry has detected 915 new cases out of 1,570 tests, marking the war-torn country\u2019s biggest one-day rise of new infections. Nine patients also died overnight, with the total number of infections now standing at 18,969 and the death toll at 309. There have been 1,763 recoveries. Most new cases have been reported in the capital city of Kabul, where the health ministry detected 423 new cases out of 811 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 7,556 cases. The western province of Herat recorded 201 new cases out of 243 tests in the last 24 hours. Testing capacity remains low in Afghanistan and experts warn that real Covid-19 figures may be much higher. Earlier this week, the International Rescue Committee warned about the low capacity of testing and said the Afghan health ministry has the capacity to test 2,000 suspected patients each day, but is receiving between 10,000 - 20,000 samples daily. The IRC said: That means between 80 - 90% of potential cases are not being tested. Afghanistan has one of the highest test positivity rates (40%) of all the countries where the IRC works, suggesting a high level of undetected population infection. Helmand province recorded 20 new cases after more than a month without new reports. On Thursday, a newly introduced acting minister of public health, Ahmad Jawad Osmani, said in a press conference that he would bring reforms to the health sector. Osmani said the coronavirus must be fought, but that reforms in hospitals and in other service areas must also be made. He said current health services do not meet the people\u2019s standards and need to be increased. New orders for German manufacturing firms saw their sharpest fall on record in April during the coronavirus shutdown, official data has shown, plunging a worse-than-expected 25.8% from March. The closely-watched indicator of future industrial activity saw \u201cthe biggest fall since the beginning of the data series in 1991\u201d just after German reunification, federal statistics authority Destatis said. The reading was down 36.6% year-on-year, it added. Destatis had previously flagged March\u2019s 15% month-on-month plunge as the worst in the history of the industrial orders measure. \u201cThe collapse in new industrial orders worsened again in line with expectations in April,\u201d the economy ministry in Berlin said, as \u201crestrictions against the corona pandemic were in place during the whole month\u201d. Other indicators of German industrial output have also plummeted in recent months. Since January, carmakers have built fewer than one million vehicles, down more than one-third compared with the first five months of 2019. Ministers in chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government this week agreed a new \u20ac130bn ($148bn) stimulus package to get the country moving again as it gradually emerges from infection control lockdowns. The country\u2019s biggest post-war package, includes cuts to VAT, handouts to families, and subsidies for greener transport options. However the economy ministry said that the \u201cgiven gradual loosening (of lockdowns) the worst of the industrial recession should be behind us\u201d. Dozens of protesters in Hong Kong marched through a shopping mall on Friday, chanting pro-democracy slogans a day after thousands defied a police ban to hold a vigil for the anniversary of China\u2019s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Protesters of all ages joined the march in the heart of the city\u2019s financial district, which ended peacefully after an hour. Some held banners that read \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d and \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,\u201d as well as the former British colonial flag, while others chanted \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d, the unofficial anthem of the protests. Thursday\u2019s anniversary of Chinese troops opening fire on student-led protests in and around Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square was particularly sensitive this year as the central government drafts national security laws for the Asian financial hub. It was the first time in 31 years that scuffles briefly disrupted what is usually a solemn day in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which traditionally organises the world\u2019s biggest memorial for the crackdown. Officers would not have intervened if protesters had not blocked roads in the district of Mong Kok, police said on Twitter on Thursday. They had rejected the application for the vigil over concerns about the coronavirus. Governments must rebuild their economies after the coronavirus crisis to withstand the next shock heading their way - climate change - the central bank governors of Britain and France have said. \u201cUnless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow\u2019s central scenario and, unlike Covid-19, no one will be able to self-isolate from it,\u201d Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and his French counterpart, Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, wrote in a joint article published in the Guardian. They said countries around the world were far from meeting their climate goals and the coronavirus pandemic had shown that reacting to a crisis at its height brought huge costs. They said: To address climate breakdown, we can instead take decisions now that reduce emissions in a less disruptive manner. That requires us to be strategic. To build back better. Central banks have increasingly put the risks of climate change into their assessments of the health of the financial services firms that they monitor. A group representing central bankers and regulators - the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) - will publish climate reference scenarios in the coming weeks which Bailey and Villeroy said would \u201craise the bar for the financial sector\u201d. The article was co-written with Frank Elderson, chair of NGFS who is an executive board member of the central bank of the Netherlands, and with former BoE governor Mark Carney, who is the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for climate action and finance. The first case of Covid-19 has been recorded among the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, adding to concerns that the virus could spread rapidly among the persecuted group. Rohingya have faced decades of oppression in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship, face severe restrictions on their movement, and have extremely limited access to health care. Rights groups are particularly concerned about the squalid conditions in camps in central Rakhine state where around 130,000 internally displaced Rohingya remain trapped. Human Rights Watch recently reported that the Burmese authorities are using the Covid-19 response measures as a pretext to further harass and extort Rohingya, and are \u201cdoubling down on a system in which they are already effectively incarcerating the population\u201d. In 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled over the border to Bangladesh, following brutal campaign by the Myanmar military that has since led to a genocide case in the UN\u2019s top court. Around 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, where the UN warns they face a continued risk of genocide. The 38 year-old man in Rakhine state who is confirmed to have the virus was tested on Monday and had returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh, officials told Radio Free Asia. This week, authorities in Bangladesh confirmed the first death from Covid-19 in the country\u2019s refugee camps, where there are also major concerns about overcrowding, poor sanitation and limited medical facilities. The man, aged 71, died on 31 May while undergoing treatment at the camp\u2019s isolation center. So far, 29 people have tested positive in the camps, which host about one million Rohingya. The Norwegian economy contracted 4.7% in April from March but the outlook for the rest of the year now looks less bleak than it did in late April, Statistics Norway has said. The mainland economy, which excludes the volatile offshore oil and gas production, is now forecast to drop 3.9% for the full year compared to the 5.5% fall predicted on 24 April when Norway was in lockdown. Hello, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the live blog for the next few hours. If you have any stories or suggestions you\u2019d like to share, feel free to get in touch: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ A quick look at the Guardian UK\u2019s front page, which is leading on a pandemic exclusive: \u201cRevealed: NHS test and trace not fully operational until September\u201d. Britain\u2019s test-and-trace system could take another four months before it is working properly, the Guardian has learned, raising concerns about how the country might cope with a second wave of coronavirus infections. Tony Prestedge, a banker drafted in to run the NHS scheme, told staff that the programme would be \u201cimperfect\u201d at launch and won\u2019t be world class until September or October. Boris Johnson had said the \u201cworld-beating\u201d scheme would be in place by 1 June. You can read more about this and get up to speed with all the developments in our UK Morning Briefing with Martin Farrer below. Fuji Rock Festival, Japan\u2019s biggest annual music event, will be cancelled for the first time ever due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers said, disappointing thousands of rock-and-roll fans who flock to the outdoor festivities every year. Since its inception in 1997, headliners at the event have included The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, The Cure and Kendrick Lamar. Last year, the event, held in the summer, attracted 130,000 people over four days. \u201cWe had hoped the pandemic would abate in time to hold this summer\u2019s festival as scheduled and were moving forward with planning,\u201d the organisers said on their website. \u201cWe apologise for taking so long to inform everyone of this decision.\u201d This year\u2019s festival had been scheduled for three days from 21 August, with American rock band The Strokes among the acts. Japan has been hit by around 18,000 infections and 900 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic. US unemployment figures are due out on Friday, with some economists predicting the rate may shoot up to almost 20%. Reuters reports that =while layoffs remained very high in the US, they eased considerably in the second half of May as businesses reopened after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of Covid-19. The employment report is compiled from two separate surveys. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the survey of households is likely to show the unemployment rate jumped to 19.8% in May from 14.7% in April, which was the highest since 1948 when the government started keeping records. The survey of establishments is forecast showing non-farm payrolls dropped by 8m jobs after a record 20.537m plunge in April. That would bring total job losses to 29.4m since March. If borne out by the new figures, that would be more than three times the jobs lost during the 2007-09 GFC, and it took six years recoup the jobs lost during that downturn. Singapore plans to soon launch a wearable device for coronavirus contact tracing that, if successful, it will distribute to all of its 5.7 million residents, the government said on Friday. The city-state has already developed the first-of-its-kind smartphone app to identify and alert people who have interacted with novel coronavirus carriers, but the bluetooth technology has been beset with glitches and the app is not widely used. \u201cWe are developing and will soon roll out a portable wearable device that will ... not depend on possession of a smartphone,\u201d foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan told parliament on Friday. \u201cIf this portable device works. We may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore ... This will be more inclusive, and it will ensure that all of us will be protected.\u201d The device being developed can be worn on a lanyard or kept in a handbag and will be battery-operated, Balakrishnan said last month in an interview with Sky News Australia. Known cases pass 6.6 million worldwide. The number of known coronavirus infections has passed 6.6 million, with 6,601,349 currently confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Deaths are approaching 390,000, with the current toll at 389,645. Brazil\u2019s death toll overtakes Italy\u2019s to become third-highest worldwide. Brazil\u2019s total Covid-19 death toll blew past that of Italy on Thursday, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. Ebola drug remdesivir endorsed as a coronavirus treatment in Australia. The antiviral drug remdesivir has been recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Australia, by the national taskforce bringing together the country\u2019s peak health groups. South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus, saying several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. Death of man after face mask arrest shines light on Mexican police brutality. Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police officers for not wearing a face mask in public.Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, was detained on 4 May by municipal police officers in the town of Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de Los Membrillos near Guadalajara.Video of the incident emerged on Wednesday, and shows the police officers with assault rifles forcing L\u00f3pez into a police pickup truck as bystanders plead for his release. Covid-19 causing 10,000 dementia deaths beyond infections, UK research says. There were almost 10,000 unexplained extra deaths among people with dementia in April, according to official figures that have prompted alarm about the severe impact of social isolation on people with the condition. The data, from the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales, reveals that, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual in April, with charities warning that a reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll. Argentina extends lockdown. Argentina has extended a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires, the capital, and some other parts of the country until 28 June, as confirmed coronavirus cases continue to rise, surpassing 20,000 earlier in the day. Virus patients with high blood pressure twice as likely to die: study. Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus infections are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday. Tokyo Olympics exec says must watch virus situation for Games decision. A Tokyo 2020 executive board member said on Friday that organisers will need to monitor the coronavirus situation until next spring to decide whether to hold the Summer Olympics next year, Kyodo News reported. Turkey announces weekend lockdown in 15 cities. Turkey will impose a weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said.In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown.Turkey has had 167,410 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa are \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said. There were concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42m after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. Politicians may need to reimpose lockdown restrictions if there is a resurgence in coronavirus cases, a leading intensive care specialist has said. Maurizio Cecconi, head of intensive care at the Humanitas research hospital in Milan and the incoming president of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, was one of three Lombardy doctors who warned the rest of Europe to \u201cget ready\u201d for Covid-19 in the early days of the outbreak. Now he says society will have to \u201clearn how to live\u201d with coronavirus until there is a vaccine. While he is optimistic about European health authorities\u2019 efforts to monitor the virus, he doesn\u2019t exclude a return to tighter social controls. \u201cIf there is an increase in transmission we need to be ready to slow down again, and maybe to put [in place] restrictive measures again,\u201d he said. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that Japan plans to allow business travellers from certain countries to bypass the country\u2019s two-week quarantine requirement, starting in summer this year \u2013 if they have proof of a negative test result: The government plans to hold talks with countries with similarly low infection rates to renegotiate immigration restrictions on both sides. Discussions will begin as early as this month with Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, with new rules to be implemented once an agreement is reached. The changes, which come after Japan lifted its nationwide coronavirus state of emergency, would likely cover corporate executives, engineers and other specialists, internal company transfers, and technical trainees, among others, according to details of a government proposal seen by Nikkei. The number of known coronavirus infections has passed 6.6 million, with 6,601,349 currently confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Deaths are approaching 390,000, with the current toll at 389,645. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected under-reporting. A Tokyo 2020 executive board member said on Friday that organisers will need to monitor the coronavirus situation until next spring to decide whether to hold the Summer Olympics next year, Kyodo News reported. The comment by lawmaker Toshiaki Endo, one of six vice presidents on the board and a former Olympics minister, marks the first time an executive from the organising committee has commented on the timing for a decision on going through with the Games, the news agency said. The Games were postponed from this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Australia\u2019s most populous state has lodged a legal application to stop a Black Lives Matter protest occurring in Sydney, state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Friday, over coronavirus restriction concerns. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller says he lodged an injunction because the numbers of those attending the protest kept growing online. Protests in groups of 10 are allowed under the health order, but that if the supreme court outlaws the protest, a gathering of hundreds would be illegal. Thousands of people have pledged to attend a protest organised in Sydney on Saturday in the wake of death of black American George Floyd in US police custody. The protest had secured permission as it originally planned to have fewer than 500 people present. But Berejiklian said when it became clear that thousands planned to attend, the legal application was made to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. Fuller said: If ten people turn up in Pitt St tomorrow, we wish them well. But if hundreds and thousands of people turn up, then they\u2019re in breach of the health order and if they haven\u2019t complied with the Supreme Court, then obviously all of the police powers available to us can be used. Berejiklian spoke directly to those intending to attend: I\u2019m asking, appealing and pleading with those thousands of people who\u2019ve indicated they\u2019re turning up to a protest \u2013 please, do not do it. Stay at home. Express yourself in a different way.\u201d A bubbly tale from Australia now ... A group of schoolchildren in the state of Queensland have sent fan mail to a lonely aquarium fish in Cairns to help him overcome his coronavirus lockdown-induced despondence, AAP reports. But since the aquarium was closed due to the pandemic, one Queensland grouper began retreating to dark corners of his tank, and even stopped eating for a few weeks. Students from Torbanlea State School empathised with Chang\u2019s plight, and made it their mission to cheer him up. \u201cOut of nowhere we received this package in the mail, and it was addressed to Chang the Lonely Grouper,\u201d aquarium boss Daniel Leipnik told AAP. Inside were scores of self portraits drawn by the year one class, and a letter addressed to Chang. \u201cWhen we couldn\u2019t come to school, some of us were feeling gloomy too,\u201d the letter read. The aquarium was under strict instructions to attach the pictures to the other side of the acrylic. \u201cI thought, \u2018oh maybe they might put the letter up in the staff room or something\u2019. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that they would actually do it,\u201d teacher Di McRae told AAP. But the aquarium did as they were told, and \u201cit did the trick\u201d. \u201cHe was in a cave the whole day, but then when we put the pictures up against the acrylic, he actually came out, and was watching it,\u201d Mr Leipnik said. \u201cPeople can relate to what an individual may feel like in an isolation type setting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people see themselves in this giant fish.\u201d Japan\u2019s household spending slumped again in April, falling 11.1% from a year earlier, government data showed Friday, as the world\u2019s third-largest economy struggled with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. The figure released by the internal affairs ministry was largely in line with market expectations of a 12.75% drop. It was the seventh straight month of declines since October, when the government hiked a sales tax. The April drop was partly attributed to declines in spending on transport and telecommunications, and well as on leisure activities. The latest figures come after official data last month confirmed Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, shrinking by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The drop in gross domestic product followed a 1.9% decline in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the tax hike and typhoons hit Japan hard - even before the pandemic shut down much of the economy. Fears about the economic impact of the virus have shaken global and Japanese financial markets and the Bank of Japan last month expanded its emergency monetary easing and cut growth forecasts for the country. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 394 to 183,271, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 26 to 8,613, the tally showed. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador urged the country to remain calm Thursday as Mexico registered the second straight day of escalating coronavirus death numbers that rivaled those coming out of Brazil or the United States, AP reports. The Health Department announced 816 more confirmed Covid-19 deaths, one day after officials reported a toll of 1,092 deaths, which was more than double the highest previous toll reported in a single day. Officials said an additional 1,033 suspected Covid-19 deaths were awaiting confirmation, suggesting daily tolls would remain high. Newly confirmed coronavirus cases also continued to rise by record amounts, with 4,442 reported Thursday. Assistant Health Secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell sought to allay fears over the new numbers, saying that daily deaths had peaked 17 May. He said many of the Covid-19 deaths reported this week actually occurred in May but were not tallied until now because of backlogs in reporting or testing. But with total deaths standing at 12,545, he acknowledged the pandemic could wind up costing as many as 35,000 lives in Mexico, local media reported. Experts said the reason for this week\u2019s sudden jump in deaths was attributable to a number of factors, including confirmation and inclusion of deaths stretching back as far as 25 days. But the country is also passing through the pandemics most critical moment with a dramatically increasing number of confirmed and suspected infections. South Africa has dehorned dozens of rhinos in three popular game parks, aiming to prevent armed poachers taking advantage of empty parks to kill them for their horns. The exercise in Pilanesburg National Park and the Mafikeng and Botsalano game reserves \u2013 all northwest of Johannesburg \u2013 leaves the rhinos with horn rumps too small for poachers to bother with, Nico Jacobs, helicopter pilot and founding member of non-profit Rhino 911 told Reuters. As Jacobs flew a helicopter over Pilanesburg last month with Reuters journalists, they spotted a lioness eating the carcass of a rhino that had been poached days earlier. Experts fear the absence of tourists may already have spurred a poaching spike. On Monday, scientists published a study showing that humans are causing mass extinction on a scale unseen since a meteor wiped out the land dinosaurs 65 million years ago, the sixth large-scale extinction in Earth\u2019s history. Decades of hunting and habitat loss have reduced Rhino numbers to about 27,000 today, according to the International Rhino Foundation. A poaching surge has wiped out thousands in the past three years. Rhino horn sells for $60,000 a kilogram, more than cocaine or gold. In East Asia, it is used in medicinal potions, despite containing the same key component as human fingernails. Dehorning is controversial, especially as it makes male rhinos vulnerable in fights. But they are not essential for survival, and, like fingernails, they grow back. As Brazil\u2019s toll passed Italy\u2019s, President Jair Bolsonaro cracked jokes in a 45 minute Facebook broadcast with foreign policy adviser Filipe Martins. During the broadcast, Bolsonaro barely mentioned victims of the virus, choosing instead to attack his political enemies, as well as the protestors who have been mobilising against him. He called demonstrators \u201caddicts\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cfools\u201d. Despite the worsening situation in Brazil, many parts of the region are moving towards reopening, against the advice of most medical experts. Miguel Lago, the director of Brazil\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies, said reopening was a mistake that was likely to cause an explosion of infections and pile further pressure on hospitals that were already struggling to cope with the pandemic. \u201cI am very worried \u2026 We are going to witness hospitals collapsing in almost every state,\u201d Lago warned. \u201cI think the worst is still to come.\u201d Coronavirus cases have now been detected in more than 70% of Brazilian cities, with the south-eastern states of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo particularly badly hit. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. In Brazil, in an online broadcast shortly before the numbers were released, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro made almost no mention of the victims but continued to publicly attack efforts to slow the advance of coronavirus with quarantine measures and social distancing. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Nobody can take it anymore,\u201d Bolsonaro said of the shutdown efforts being implemented by state governors and mayors across Brazil. \u201cThe collateral impact will be far greater than those people who unfortunately lost their lives because of these last three months here,\u201d Bolsonaro said. The numbers \u2013 which came after Mexico reported a record daily tally of more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday \u2013 reinforced fears that Latin America\u2019s two biggest economies, and other countries in the region, were facing a bleak few months. Brazil\u2019s total COVID-19 death toll blew past that of Italy on Thursday, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus infections are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday. For in-patients with the virus who had stopped taking medication for high blood pressure, the risk of dying doubled again, they reported in the European Heart Journal. \u201cIt is important that patients with high blood pressure realise that they are at increased risk of dying from Covid-19,\u201d said senior author Fei Li, a cardiologist at Xijing Hospital in Xian, China. For the study, researchers in China and Ireland retroactively examined cases admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan between 5 February and 15 March. Nearly 30% - 850 patients - had a history of hypertension, another term for high blood pressure. 4% of those patients died, compared with just over one percent of the 2,027 patients without hypertension. After adjusting for age, sex and other medical conditions, the researchers calculated that having high blood pressure increased the risk of dying two-fold. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported a record 4,442 additional cases of the novel coronavirus in the country on Thursday, and 816 more deaths, bringing the total to 105,680 cases and 12,545 deaths. Argentina extended on Thursday a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires, the capital, and some other parts of the country until 28 June, as confirmed coronavirus cases continue to rise, surpassing 20,000 earlier in the day. The three-week extension of the lockdown, which had been due to expire June 7, will impact the capital city, the province of Buenos Aires and some other areas that account for the highest concentration of confirmed infections, President Alberto Fernandez said during a press conference. The rest of the country will move to a phase of \u201cmandatory and preventive social distancing.\u201d The next phase will include new permissions, including outdoor exercise during certain hours in the city of Buenos Aires, which has the highest concentration of cases, officials said. Argentina recorded 929 new infections on Thursday, one of the highest daily counts since the pandemic began. The country has 20,197 cases, mostly in the city Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires. The death toll is at 608. \u201cOur results are still good, but we have not yet overcome the problem,\u201d Fernandez said. Argentina has been under mandatory lockdown since March 20, though officials already relaxed restrictions in some areas of the country. Argentina has a commercial flight ban until 1 September, one of the world\u2019s strictest travel measures during the pandemic. Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police officers for not wearing a face mask in public. Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, was detained on 4 May by municipal police officers in the town of Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de Los Membrillos near Guadalajara. Video of the incident emerged on Wednesday, and shows the police officers with assault rifles forcing L\u00f3pez into a police pickup truck as bystanders plead for his release. \u201cJust for not a wearing a mask?\u201d asks one witness, incredulously. \u201cHe was resisting,\u201d answers an officer. L\u00f3pez\u2019s relatives went looking for him at the police station, but were told he had been taken to a public hospital in Guadalajara. When they reached the hospital they found his dead body. He had a bullet would in his foot, and an autopsy later revealed that he died of a blunt trauma to the head. China reported five new Covid-19 cases and three new asymptomatic infections for June 4, the health commission said on Friday. The National Health Commission said all five of the new cases were imported, involving travellers from overseas. For 3 June, China had reported one confirmed case and four asymptomatic cases. China does not count asymptomatic cases, people who test positive for the coronavirus but do not exhibit Covid-19 symptoms, as confirmed infections. The total number of infections in China stands at 83,027. The death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. There were almost 10,000 unexplained extra deaths among people with dementia in April, according to official figures that have prompted alarm about the severe impact of social isolation on people with the condition. The data, from the Office for National Statistics, reveals that, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual in April, with charities warning that a reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous that people with dementia have been dying in their thousands,\u201d said Kate Lee, chief executive officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the devastating effect of coronavirus on people with dementia who catch it, but our [research] reveals that the threat of the virus extends far beyond that.\u201d Charlotte Graham McLay reports from Wellington: As health officials announce each new day of no new Covid-19 cases, social media explodes with New Zealanders celebrating the news. \u201cThat feeling like you got away with something that seemed impossible and you can\u2019t quite believe it even though you want to believe it,\u201d wrote one, on Twitter. \u201cBut for an entire country.\u201d Twenty-two New Zealanders have died of Covid-19, ; thousands have lost their jobs and the nation\u2019s largest export sector, tourism, lies in tatters. But as New Zealanders look to the hundreds of thousands of deaths recorded in other countries, there is a sense that the rest of the world faced a different pandemic, the disastrous scale of which never fully arrived here. Now, providing there are no new and unexpected cases to marr the country\u2019s 13-day streak of zero fresh instances of Covid-19, scientists say they expect to be able to declare next week that the virus has been eliminated from New Zealand \u2013 making it the first country among the OECD group of wealthy nations, and the first country that has recorded more than 100 cases to make such a statement, analysts said. The antiviral drug remdesivir has been recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Australia, by the national taskforce bringing together the country\u2019s peak health groups. The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce said Australian doctors treating adults with moderate, severe or critical Covid-19 should consider using the drug to aid recovery times. The antiviral drug is the first medication to be recommended as a considered treatment for patients treated in hospital after contracting coronavirus. Originally developed for the treatment of Ebola, clinical trials have shown remdesivir may improve recovery time for people with moderate to critical Covid-19 symptoms. The taskforce\u2019s executive director, Associate Professor Julian Elliott, said while it was early days it was a significant step forward. \u201cThis is the first information we have that a drug has a beneficial effect as a treatment for Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe preliminary data published so far from two clinical trials indicate that it can reduce the time for someone to recover from Covid-19. \u201cHowever, we do not yet have definitive information that remdesivir will reduce the risk of dying from the disease.\u201d The thousands of people protesting the death of George Floyd have a \u201ccivic duty\u201d to be tested for the coronavirus and help New York avoid a spike in new cases as it slowly restarts its economy, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. There\u2019s widespread concern that people packing in tightly for demonstrations, sometimes without faces coverings, could lead to more Covid-19 cases. Cuomo was particularly concerned about daily mass demonstrations in New York City, which is poised to relax some restrictions amid an intense, monthslong effort to tame the outbreak. \u201cIf you were at a protest, go get a test, please,\u201d Cuomo said at his daily briefing. \u201cThe protesters have a civic duty here also. Be responsible, get a test.\u201d An estimated 20,000 people have demonstrated in New York City alone, the governor said, as he expanded the state\u2019s testing criteria to include people who attended recent protests across the state. Around 30,000 have protested across the state. \u201cNew York City had the highest number of protesters,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe have to be smart.\u201d South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. The country now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. South Africa is the sub-Saharan African country hardest hit by the pandemic. President Cyril Ramaphosa on March 27 ordered South Africans to observe a lockdown aimed at slowing the disease\u2019s spread. The move sharply limited people\u2019s freedom of movement while slowing an economy already in recession. But Ramaphosa has gradually eased the lockdown measures and allowed most of the economy to restart. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, I welcome your questions, comments and tips on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. South Africa, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent, has recorded a record increase in confirmed infections, with more than 3,000 in 24 hours. More than half of all cases are in the Western Cape province. The country imposed a strict, nationwide lockdown that included the banning of alcohol and cigarette sales, but has since eased restrictions. Meanwhile in New York, where an estimated 30,000 people joined demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, governor Andrew Cuomo has urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m not a nervous Nellie, I\u2019m just looking at the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany wear masks. But there is no social distancing. Police are in their face ... If you were at a protest, get a test, please.\u201d Here are the key developments from the last few hours: South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus, saying several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. Turkey announces weekend lockdown in 15 cities. Turkey will impose a weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said.In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown.Turkey has had 167,410 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. The UK unveiled a $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund aimed at ensuring poorer countries can access doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine. The announcement was made at the third Gavi vaccine alliance replenishment summit, a virtual pledging event that raised $8.8bn. The UK\u2019s transport secretary, has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June. Grant Shapps added that people can be refused permission to travel if they do not comply and could be fined. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa are \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said. There were concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42 million after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
