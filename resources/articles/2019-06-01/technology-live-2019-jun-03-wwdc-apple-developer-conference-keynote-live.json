Apple may have had a good morning inside its conference centre, but outside the room, things went less well: the company\u2019s stock is sliding on reports that the US department of justice is considering an investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices. Before we close the liveblog, one last piece of late-breaking news from the iOS 13 website, of great import: the volume indicator is now being moved to the corner of the screen so that it doesn\u2019t pop-over the video you\u2019re watching and spoil everything. Tim\u2019s back on stage, thanking everyone, and giving (vague) release dates: A developer beta for the new OSs today, a public beta in July, and the final release in \u201cfall\u201d. And that\u2019s that! More of the developer-focused launches: Swift is getting UI scripting support, with SwiftUI. The developers in the audience are VERY EXCITED about how much less code you need to write a UI compared to before. You can also see the preview update live when you edit the code, which is again VERY EXCITING to the audience. We move into the really nerdy bit: new APIs for developers who work with AR or Apple\u2019s programming language Swift. Skip this if that makes no sense to you. If it does: RealityKit and RealityComposer let developers work with AR experiences even if they can\u2019t handle graphics engines or low-level code. ARKit 3 now has automatic \u201cpeople occlusion\u201d, letting the developer know exactly where a person is and put things in front of or behind them. It also has built-in motion capture. ARKit 3 gets demo\u2019d onstage by (the Microsoft-owned) Mojang, creators of Minecraft, who show off the new Minecraft Earth. You can build a world, walk around inside it, and play with friends. It looks fun, though \u201cit\u2019s hard to believe that there\u2019s nothing on the ground or around us on the stage\u201d has to win the prize for least convincing line delivery of the event. A big launch for developers: \u201cProject Catalyst\u201d lets developers \u201cquickly and easily develop Mac apps from their iPad apps\u201d. \u201cThis means one development team for the first time can build a single app that can span all the way from iPhone to iPad to Mac.\u201d Mac apps that are coming at launch: the game Asphalt 9: Legends, Twitter and Atlassian\u2019s Jira. Federighi continues with the new features: Sidecar lets users use their iPads as a second screen for their Mac, or even as a graphics tablet, wired or wirelessly. Voice control lets users with motor impairments control their Mac and iOS devices entirely with their voice. \u201cFind My\u201d combines Find My iPhone with Find My Friends, and even works if the device is offline. How? Your sleeping macbook continues to send out a secure bluetooth beacon, that nearby iPhones \u2013 anyone\u2019s nearby iPhone \u2013 can pick up, and report to Apple. It\u2019s basically how hardware trackers like Tile works. Activation lock: just like on iPhones, you can set your Mac up so that it cannot be even wiped and reused without your password. Screen Time is coming to Mac from iOS, so that you can block Twitter from Safari on the desktop as well as on the go. And finally, macOS! Craig Federighi returns to reveal that the new release is called Catalina, after Santa Catalina Island in California. And then we jump straight in to an obituary for iTunes. Federighi gently mocks the app\u2019s history, uttering the definitely-not-true line that \u201cCustomers Love iTunes\u201d, and that they\u2019ve been asking whether it can do \u201ceven more\u201d, joking that the next version will have a calendar and web browser as well. In fact, it\u2019s being split: Music, Podcasts and TV will replace the single iTunes app. Phone management, meanwhile, will occur in the Finder for the first time. Music and Podcasts look very similar to the old iTunes, although Podcasts gains a new auto-transcription feature letting you search the contents of podcasts. And the TV app looks basically the same as the TV app on Apple TVs and iPads. We get a price and release date! The Mac Pro will start at $5999, this autumn. (Expect that to be \u00a35999). And the pro display will start at $4999, with an anti-glare version for $5999, and will also be available this autumn. There\u2019s also a new Apple Pro display. It\u2019s HDR enabled. It has a cheesegrater back, just like the new Mac Pro. It has a 6K resolution and a 32\u201d panel. It looks a bit like an iMac. Apple is launching it by comparing it to a $43,000 reference monitor, which is some interesting anchoring. Anything will look like good value when it\u2019s compared to the price of a mid-sized car. There\u2019s a lot of specs coming for the Mac Pro: it has a 28 core Intel Xeon, with 300 watts of power, supporting 1.5TB of Ram, and 8 internal PCIe slots. It has built in ethernet, four Thunderbolt 3 slots, two USB-A slots and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It also has a new built-in graphics module, the MPX, that lets users dock powerful AMD graphics cards in a\u2026 new fancy way. But they can also dock normal graphics cards in a normal way. There\u2019s also another card called Afterburner, which users can buy purely to speed up their video rendering and playback. And it has wheels. Back to Tim, who turns us towards the Mac \u2013 and the first new hardware of the day: the Mac Pro. It no longer looks like a small wastepaper bin. In fact, it looks like\u2026 the old Power Mac: Moving on to the newest OS in Apple\u2019s line-up: today is the 0th birthday of iPadOS! Happy Birthday iPadOS! Why the spin-off? Because as the iPad has become more and more of a computer, it\u2019s got more and more features to itself. Features like: You can pin widgets to your homescreen. Slide-overs get their own multi-tasking. Think of it as a mini iPhone on your iPad. Multi-window capability comes to iPad apps. You can run two copies of the same app side-by-side, or run a third copy (or a fourth, or a fifth) alongside other apps at the same time. The Files app has a Column view! Someone in the audience cheered for this! Files also gets file sharing through iCloud Drive \u2013 and access to thumbdrives for the first time. Safari gets an update to force websites to serve the desktop version to iPads. That includes web-apps like Google Docs. Safari also gets a download manager, keyboard shortcuts \u201cand more\u201d. Designers will be happy: you can now download custom fonts from the app store. Try remembering this one: a three-finger pinch is a new gesture for copying text, and a three-finger spread for pasting \u2013 with a three-finger swipe for undoing. Apple Pencil latency will drop from 20ms to 9ms. And 3rd party apps will now get to develop directly for the pencil. And again, we get the round-up of things that just missed the keynote: Now for the accessory roundup! Airpods: Siri can read messages as soon as they arrive and you can instantly respond. And if two people have airpods and iPhones, they can now share audio just by tapping phones together, and listen at the same time. Homepod: Get home and put your phone near the homepod to hand off music or a phone call to the smart speaker. It\u2019s also getting live radio for the first time via Tune-In. And the speaker can personalise responses based on who is speaking for messages, reminders, notes, music and more. Carplay: You can now have music and maps visible at the same time. Siri is now a popover, with the screen remaining visible when the voice assistant is active. Siri: Last year\u2019s Shortcuts feature will get an upgrade, giving you suggested Siri shortcuts automatically. And Siri is getting an AI voice for the first time, ditching the old human recordings for good. It sounds better! Camera and Photos are also getting some new features \u2013 simple video editing in Photos, a new depth-sensitive filter in the Camera, and a whole new way of browsing photos in the main app: Apple\u2019s going to use machine learning to intelligently hide duplicates, and to select new thumbnails that reflect a given day, month or year. (It will be interesting to see how good Apple is at selecting these photos without access to the huge personal data stores of Facebook or Google. You may just have told your phone your loved-ones\u2019 birthdays, but can it easily tell a meaningful shot from a half-arsed selfie?) iMessage users can now choose to share their name and memoji (the dead-eyed avatars that Apple introduced two years ago) with people when they text them for the first time. And memoji get yet more variations: make-up, accessories and a variety of haircuts and colours are added to the options. If you don\u2019t want to film yourself making odd faces, Apple\u2019s now adding a sticker pack of your own personal memoji letting you send yourself in pre-made poses. (Like Bitmoji, if you\u2019ve ever used that Snapchat feature before.) And those features are coming to any Apple device with an A9 chip or newer \u2013 iPhone 6 or later. And Apple now takes the fight to Amazon and its Ring subsidiary, offering a new API for smart home security cameras. HomeKit Security Cameras will share footage with your Apple devices, in a way that means the manufacturer can\u2019t watch the footage, even if they wanted to. But not everything is about competition: a new feature for secure routers is being built with another Amazon subsidiary, Eero. Craig Federighi returns, to hit Google and Facebook with a big stick labelled Privacy. Users will be able to select a new \u201cjust once\u201d option for requests like location tracking. Apps which try to sneakily find out where you are using Bluetooth or Wifi now won\u2019t be able to get that data. And Apple introduces a new federated login service, competing with \u201csign in with Google\u201d and \u201csign in with Facebook\u201d: \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d. \u201cJust tap it and you\u2019re authenticated with FaceID, logged in with a new account without revealing any personal information\u2026 Some apps may want your name or even your email \u2013 you can choose to share your real email address, or you can choose to hide it, and we\u2019ll create a unique random email address that forwards to your real address. And we give each app a new unique random address\u201d That last one is a big, big threat to the business model of not just Google and Facebook, but a whole host of companies that require all the personal information of their users to monetise their services. So what does \u201cDark Mode\u201d mean for iOS? A new wallpaper for the background and slightly darker see-through widgets leaves the lock screen looking barely different, but open an app and the change is more obvious: apps are black, not white. It\u2019s pretty, but fairly obvious, so it\u2019s no surprising that Craig Fed drops other reveals in the dark mode walkthrough as well: Swipe-to-type is coming to the iOS keyboard. Photos will now automatically suggest people to share pictures with, based on who\u2019s in the image. Music automatically syncs lyrics as you listen. And then on to the other apps. Mail gets \u2018desktop-class formatting\u2019, Notes gets a new filing system, and Reminders gets an almost total rewrite: quick entry, links to people, and an advanced tracking system. Maps has been rebuilt \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d (in California), and will be across the US by the end of 2019, and \u201cselect other countries\u201d in 2020. Meg Frost, a director of product research at Apple, works through more changes to Maps. Users can make add favourites to their app, or put locations in \u201ccollections\u201d, letting them collect groups of places when, for instance, planning a trip. They can then take a closer look using Street View \u2013 sorry, \u201cLook Around\u201d, Apple\u2019s own version of the venerable Google feature. Tim Cook turns to iOS, with a direct swipe at Google: 85% of iPhone users are using iOS 12, while just 10% of Android users are on Android 9. Ouch. And introuduces Craig Federighi to introduce iOS 13. Fed says the new iOS is faster. How much faster? 30% faster to unlock with FaceID; 50% smaller app downloads; 60% smaller app updates; 2x faster at launching apps. But the first big new feature gets introduced with a video of some jellyfish: it\u2019s dark mode. And there\u2019s more \u2013 too much more for Apple to read out, or me to transcribe. Take a look at the feature wall: Health and fitness on the Apple Watch gets a whole sub-keynote: Activity Trends is coming to the Activity app on the iPhone, showing Watch users how their recent activity habits compares with the past year. A new Noise app will use the watch\u2019s microphone to warn you if you\u2019re in a loud environment where your hearing health is under threat. And cycle tracking comes to the Apple Watch. \u201cA simple, discreet way to visualise your menstrual cycle right on your wrist\u201d. The feature is also being (re)launched in the Health app on iOS. Moving quickly on to the Apple Watch, then. Cook introduces Kevin Lynch to run through the new features of watchOS 6: New watch faces! Some purely visual updates, others with a few more smarts, including a solar clock \u201cTaptic chimes\u201d: the watch will buzz your wrist on the hour. It will also, if you want to be hated, play audible birdsong on the hour. New apps: a calculator, voice memo, and audiobook apps. The calculator can automatically add a tip and split the bill. And a new App Store, just for the Apple Watch, letting you install Apps directly on your watch. The nerdy bit: The app store is necessary because app developers can now make apps that run fully on the watch for the first time. They\u2019re also now allowed to stream audio directly from the internet, as well as access have longer access to sensors than previously. Cook runs through the tvOS features himself: Multi-user support for tvOS, letting the company personalise recommendations to each member of the household. Support for the XBox One and PlayStation 4 controllers on Apple TV, letting users who already have game consoles in the house use their own controllers on the box. And\u2026 new screensavers filmed underwater. Cook opens by running through the services that Apple already announced earlier this year: Apple News+, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and so on. Some of these won\u2019t be arriving until \u201cfall\u201d, likely alongside iOS 13, so don\u2019t expect much more on them today. Other, that is, than a new trailer for a fun-looking alt-history series, For All Mankind, coming exclusively to Apple TV+. The show imagines a world where the space race never ended after a Soviet cosmonaut became the first man on the moon. But really, that\u2019s just a segue into the first item on the agenda: tvOS. As ever, we open with some natty promos: first, a cute animation featuring a load of emojis scrolling across the screen (a reminder, perhaps, that the small icons are the single best thing Apple has to get people to update their iOS), and then a classy black-and-white video showing developers working on their apps deep into the night (a reminder that this is, after all, the worldwide developers\u2019 conference). And then Tim Cook takes the stage, thanking \u201cthe millions of incredible Apple developers across the world\u201d. iOS 13: the headline will be a new dark mode for iPad and iPhone, letting users turn everything shady with one click. Elsewhere, look for new Siri integrations, an upgrade to Find My iPhone, and maybe the death of 3D Touch. iPadOS: a last-minute leak suggests the iPad version of iOS is being spun off into a whole new line, letting Apple more easily launch features that only affect iPads or iPhones, rather than lumping everything together. What sort of features? Well, maybe real app windows (that\u2019s a lower-case W) for iPad users who want to get real work done. Mac Pros: Don\u2019t expect a release, or even a release date, but if Apple doesn\u2019t at least give a glimpse of the long-awaited upgrade to its most powerful computer, then something\u2019s gone wrong. MacOS 10.15: Marzipan, marzipan, marzipan. That\u2019s the codename for the project to port iOS apps to the Mac, and expect that to be front and centre of the conference. The most obvious outcome? The (overhyped) death of iTunes. It\u2019s not really going anywhere (the core app is probably just being renamed Music), but features including Podcasts, TV and the App Store are all likely to be spun-off into their own apps. WatchOS 6: Period tracking could go prime-time, as Apple finally graduates reproductive health from an embarrassed sub-menu in its Health app to a full-blown feature in its own right. The name \u201cCycles\u201d is being suggested. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog of Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers\u2019 Conference. We\u2019ll be kicking off at 10am Pacific Time \u2013 that\u2019s 6pm UK time, and 3am in New South Wales if you\u2019re staying up for all the latest news. If you want to watch along live, Apple is streaming the event on its website. Otherwise, stick around, and we\u2019ll digest two hours of back-slapping, stat-crunching and buzzword-dropping into one easy feed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
