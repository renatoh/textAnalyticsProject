Viduka missed last night's friendly against Venezuela in Caracas ostensibly as he is recovering from a slight hamstring strain sustained during last week's 4-1 Premiership victory over Wolves. The club's medical staff were of the opinion that a 26-hour round trip to South America would hardly help the striker's fitness. Despite that injury, and the fact that Viduka had only just returned from a prolonged period of compassionate leave in Australia that meant he had not trained fully for three weeks, the ASA rejected Leeds's written request to have the 28-year-old withdrawn from the friendly. Under Fifa rules a player cannot represent his club when his country has requested his release for an international, with the restriction liable to be prolonged by a further five days. That would rule Viduka out of Saturday's lunchtime match at Old Trafford. Talks were held yesterday between the ASA, Leeds and Viduka's representative Chris Page and will continue today, with the Australian football authorities keenly aware that the player could threaten to quit international football should he be banned. The Australia coach Frank Farina has accepted the withdrawals of Liverpool's Harry Kewell and Brett Emerton of Blackburn Rovers through injury but the fact that Viduka completed the game against Wolves appears to have worked against him. Eight other British-based players have travelled to Caracas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
