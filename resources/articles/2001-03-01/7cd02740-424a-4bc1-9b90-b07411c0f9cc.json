Its aim is to examine the meaning of citizenship in modern Britain and it looks at political participation and attitudes and voluntary activity of all kinds. Some 74% of our sample claimed to have voted in the 1997 general election, a figure which is only marginally more than the 72% who really did cross their ballot papers. Asking this question is an important guide to accuracy, since there is a well-known tendency for interviewees to claim they voted when in fact they did not. Since our audit provided a fairly good retrospective picture of the 1997 turnout, this suggests that it is a reliable guide to future behaviour. When asked how likely they were to vote next time, only 65% claimed it was \"very likely\" and if this works as a predictor then the 2001 general election is set to have the lowest turnout of any since Lloyd George went to the country in 1918. We also looked at differences in likely turnout among party supporters. As the chart shows, 87% of those who voted Tory in 1997 are very likely to vote in the next election. However, this is true of only 74% of those who voted Labour last time. As a political formation the Tories may be in difficulty but it appears that William Hague is shoring up support among the core Tory voters in a way which Tony Blair is not. These apathetic Labour voters tend to be dispropor tionately semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers, in their 20s and 30s and living on relatively low incomes. They also tend to be female and have relatively limited educational qualifications. They are twice as likely to strongly disagree with the proposition that \"the government is doing a good job in managing public services such as health care and education\" than they are to strongly agree with it. By the same token, they are more likely to distrust the government than voters in general. If translated into actual votes, these differences in turnout intentions between Labour and Tory supporters have important implications for the number of seats the Blair government is likely to lose in the election. Monthly opinion polls such as the Guardian/ICM suggest that Labour is far enough ahead of the Tories to repeat its 1997 victory on roughly the same scale. But take differen tial turnout into account and the picture does not look quite so rosy. In 1997, Labour got just over 13.5m votes and the Tories 9.5m. Imagine what would happen if 87% of the Tories voted again for their party and 74% of Labour supporters did the same for their party. In this event Labour would end up with 54% of the combined Labour and Tory vote total, rather than the 58% it actually took last time. The Tory share would go up from 42% of the two-party vote in 1997 to 46%. On this basis, Labour would still win the election but would lose seats. If we apply a seat forecasting model to these vote shares we can see what effects this has on the composition of the House of Commons. The model translates shares of total vote into seats and is based on the results of all general elections since the second world war. The model predicts that Labour would win 366 seats and the Tories 234, giving the Labour government an overall Commons majority of 73. Putting this another way, some 52 Labour MPs will be looking for alternative employment on the day after polling day - and that is because of differential turnout. However, if Labour managed to persuade their erstwhile supporters to turn out on the same scale as in 1997, few if any of these MPs would lose their places. We are simplifying. This projection does not take into account changes in the composition of the electorate over the past four years, vote switching between parties, tactical voting and several other factors. It does not take into account the extent to which Labour's grassroots will campaign to get the vote out locally. But it may be a portent of things to come, and it does have two further implications. If Labour wins the next election with a majority comparable to 1997's then this effectively leaves the Tories in the cold until the election after the election after next, which means 2009 or 2010. By contrast, a majority of 73 could easily be lost in one go, making the 2005 election an open contest. A second implication is that a loss by the Tories on the same scale as occurred in 1997 almost certainly means curtains for William Hague. But the loss of an election in which he wins back nearly 70 seats for the Tories might well save his leadership. \u0095 Paul Whiteley is professor of government at the University of Essex and director of the ESRC programme on democracy and participation. whiteley@essex.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
