The Home Office confirmed that Mr Evans - once described by Mr Blunkett as a restraining influence on his \"wilder instincts\" - no longer worked at the department and left last Thursday, the day after the minister resigned. John Toker, the former ITN producer and Tonight with Trevor McDonald executive, who acted as Mr Blunkett's personal press secretary and the department's head of news, remains in his post. Mr Toker and Mr Blunkett's principal private secretary, Jonathan Sedgwick, were both caught up in the media debacle surrounding the affair, accompanying Mr Blunkett to a meeting with Kimberly Quinn in her lawyer's office following revelations about their relationship in the News of the World. Mr Toker is employed by the Home Office as a civil servant and by contract must be apolitical. However, special advisers like Mr Evans - and Alastair Campbell when he worked for Tony Blair - are political appointees. \"He [Mr Evans] wasn't working for the Labour party, he was working for the Home Office. Special advisors are employed personally by cabinet ministers, so when the cabinet minister goes that's the end of it,\" a Labour party spokesman said. Mr Evans, a Labour party regional press officer for Wales until the 2001 election, has been by Mr Blunkett's side throughout the ordeal of the past weeks. Earlier this month he briefed the press outside the high court, when the former home secretary won the first round of a court battle with his pregnant former lover over access to her two-year-old son. He helped pick up the pieces following many of Mr Blunkett's more outspoken declarations including his remarks about cracking open the champagne when mass murderer Harold Shipman died. Mr Blunkett said his first thought on hearing about the disgraced doctor's death was to celebrate: \"You wake up and you receive a phone call - Shipman's topped himself. You have just got to think for a minute: is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it.\" The former home secretary later admitted he had to be \"very careful\" about what he said in his job and paid tribute to his \"splendid special adviser\" Mr Evans, saying he \"restrains my wilder instincts\". Mr Blunkett obviously worried what Mr Evans would think of his lack of political correctness. When he made the Welsh the butt of a joke during an anti-racism meeting, saying \"[the athlete] Colin Jackson succeeded, despite being Welsh,\" he prefaced his comment with: \"Huw Evans, my special adviser, is going to kill me for saying this.\" Mr Evans did not return phone messages left by MediaGuardian. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
