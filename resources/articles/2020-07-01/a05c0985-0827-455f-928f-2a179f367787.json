Ministers have pledged to review the 2005 Gambling Act in the face of a growing consensus among MPs and addiction experts that legislation passed under Tony Blair\u2019s government is no longer effective. But in a wide-ranging report, a select committee led by former ITV and BBC chairman Lord Grade said sweeping changes could go forward without the need for a review. Proposals include: An end to gambling sport sponsorship. Strict affordability checks on customers. A testing regime to ban addictive new games. A mandatory levy to fund addiction treatment. Speed of online games reduced to match real casinos. Tough controls on \u201cfree bets\u201d and bonus inducements. The committee on the social and economic impact of the gambling industry demanded an end to the UK\u2019s \u201clax regulation\u201d, pointing to statistics suggesting a third of a million people, 55,000 of them children, are problem gamblers, with up to 2 million people affected by their addiction. \u201cNobody is up for banning all gambling, we just want to reduce the harm, reduce the suicides, reduce the misery of the people in the ripple effect of problem gambling,\u201d said Lord Grade. \u201cWe\u2019re attacking part of the market that has gone very horribly wrong.\u201d The Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) has yet to set out a timetable for gambling reform, despite cross-party support for change. The committee called for urgent action, saying that DMCS had \u201cseldom been proactive, and sometimes has been more obstructive than reactive\u201d in addressing gambling harm. Some of its recommendations, such as an 18+ age limit on the National Lottery, require amendments to the Gambling Act but most only require changes to other legislation, meaning they could go ahead before the review. One of the more eye-catching proposals is a ban on sport sponsorship, including logos on football shirts, stadium naming rights and pitchside hoardings. Clubs outside the top tier of football, some of which are heavily reliant on gambling sponsorship money, would be given until 2023 to wean themselves off it. The Lords echoed recent criticism of the Gambling Commission by the Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office. They called for the regulator\u2019s \u00a319m budget to be increased to help rein in an industry that takes more than \u00a311bn a year from gamblers. The regulator should make more use of its powers to fine companies and remove their licences to operate, they said. It should also impose tough new affordability checks, limit stakes on certain online products and implement a testing regime that could ban new products if they are deemed too dangerous. Online table games such as roulette should be slowed down so that they cannot be played any faster than real casinos, the report said. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it was underfunded but said it was \u201cworking to improve\u201d and would soon publish measures to tackle addictive features in games and tighten up affordability checks. The committee also called for an end to inducements such as \u201cfree bets\u201d or bonuses unless customers opt in to receiving them. It follows widespread concern about controversial VIP schemes, which have featured in a string of cases in which vulnerable people lost large amounts of money and in some cases took their own lives. \u201cThe behaviour of some gambling operators, where vulnerable people were targeted with inducements to continue gambling when the operators knew they could not afford to, shocked the committee,\u201d said Lord Grade. Research has shown that around 60% of the industry\u2019s income is derived from people with a severe or moderate gambling disorder. The lengthy report includes a string of proposals, some of which could be enacted by the end of September, such as classifying \u201cloot boxes\u201d in video games as gambling. The lords joined calls for a mandatory levy on profits to fund addiction research, education and treatment, amid mounting concern about industry influence on how its voluntary donations are spent. They also want to see a gambling ombudsman set up to resolve disputes between customers and companies. The Betting and Gaming Council, the industry\u2019s lobbying group, said it did not agree with all the recommendations but said it was already working with the Gambling Commission to implement others. \u201cWe would now urge the government to bring forward their planned review of the Gambling Act without delay and to work with the industry on an evidence-led approach to future regulation,\u201d said a spokesperson. DCMS said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to protecting people from the risks of gambling related harm and have been clear that we will review the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
