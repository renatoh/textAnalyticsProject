So, Will Adamsdale, 2004's winner, what are you up to these days? \"I'm getting as many people as I can \u2013 although it might just be me \u2013 to meet up in Trafalgar Square and move London. Just somehow move it a foot.\" Adamsdale is talking about his Jacksathon tour, in which he resurrects the character of \"motivational life coach\" Chris John Jackson. It was this spoof creation, portrayed by Adamsdale in his hilarious hit show Jackson's Way, that won the actor-writer-comedian the 2004 Perrier award. Chances are standup fans have since seen little of Adamsdale, who's better known for his own theatrical works, such as subsequent shows The Human Computer and The Receipt (which won a 2006 Edinburgh Fringe First award and is now being filmed). Like Jackson's Way, these were charming, idiosyncratic narratives about men struggling to make sense of alienating modernity. Adamsdale, as well as starring in the films Four Lions and The Boat That Rocked, is also about to appear in the new Channel 4 sitcom Campus, set in a polytechnic. But for now, he's scuttling around London with Jacksathon, a 26-night tour of his Jackson's Way show, broadcasting his character's trademark theory that \"around every point-full action, there's an infinite number of pointless actions\". Jackson \u2013 plastic radio mic taped to cheek, hokey US accent in place \u2013 promotes the value of meaningless behaviour: try making two words that don't rhyme rhyme; try putting your hand in two places at the same time. It can't be done, but why not \"push through with intensity\" in your bid to make the impossible happen? It sounds daft. In fact, it is daft. But there's more to Jackson's Way than a silly spoof of self-help guru waffle. Famous fans like Stewart Lee have hymned the show's odd profundity: Jackson's ideology throws into relief the purposelessness of our supposedly meaningful lives. \"Once you realise it's not saying anything of any substance,\" says Adamsdale, \"you're liberated and made childlike. It's a weird alchemy and none of it feels like my doing.\" Jackson has, in fact, become like Frankenstein's monster: he now seems to exist outwith his creator's control \u2013 or understanding. \"His theories,\" continues Adamsdale, \"forbid him to help anybody \u2013 because that would have a point. So he's trapped. You're looking at a man gradually realising he's in a disastrous situation.\" But the show is abstract enough to allow other interpretations. \"It's not about him being a real person,\" says Adamsdale, who leaves open the possibility that Jackson is more delusional fantasist than motivational speaker. \"What excites me is that maybe it's all a dream of his. Maybe he's just a tramp or something. Maybe he doesn't exist.\" The trouble with characters who don't exist, of course, is that they're hard to televise. Adamsdale was inundated with offers after his Perrier triumph, but the Jackson act remains undeveloped, something he failed to capitalise on fully. \"Someone told me, 'It's as if a stopwatch has clicked, and you've got a year.' And I remember thinking, 'Oh no, the stopwatch is going to run out.'\" Furrowed and thoughtful in conversation, Adamsdale laughs when he remembers that, while the stopwatch was ticking down, he went off travelling. \"What was I doing?! But you are who you are. And I'm perverse and difficult and I shoot myself in the foot.\" He's also a perfectionist \u2013 and frets that TV would pin down a character better kept mysterious. That's why Adamsdale cancelled a follow-up to Jackson's Way, intended for Edinburgh in 2009. \"I realised that the first show, the seminar format, showcases everything that's great about Jackson, without giving too much away. It's also where he's most versatile. So why not stick with that?\" The London tour, however, will feature added Jacksathon stunts, like the Trafalgar Square shunt-the-town one. \"I like the idea of touring a city,\" says Adamsdale. \"It's totally Jacksonish. It's perverse. No one does it, because it's really complicated. So now, on top of the complications everyone's got from just living in London, they have to work out which night [to go to] my show and where. It's almost annoying.\" More than six years after winning the award, Jackson's influence in standup is still widely felt: Tom Basden and Tim Key (2009's award winner) cite his theatrical brand of comedy as an inspiration. And they are not alone. So Adamsdale could afford to laugh when, after searching for mentions of his name on the web, \"I read myself described as an 'inexplicable' winner of the Perrier.\" While it's true that acts as experimental and commercially maladroit as Jackson's Way seldom bag the big prizes, the idea of winning \"inexplicably\" is just the kind of meaningless activity that Adamsdale appreciates. \"Actually,\" he says, \"I think that's kind of cool.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
