That is not what our Founders had in mind. The good thing is that the Republicans have NEVER been more united. We will win!\u201d Pelosi said that Trump had engaged in misconduct on a historic scale. \u201cThe facts are uncontested,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security by withholding military aid and a crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for the announcement of an investigation into his political rival. \u201cThe president\u2019s actions are a profound violation of the public trust. The president\u2019s actions have seriously violated the constitution, especially when he says and acts upon the belief that \u2018article 2 says I can do whatever I want\u2019. No.\u201d If it has not already begun, the judiciary committee would now draft articles of impeachment for approval as early as next week. A vote on whether to impeach Trump could follow on the floor of the House before a 20 December holiday break. Trump could become the second president in the last 150 years and only the third of 44 US presidents to be impeached. In her somber delivery and methodical quotation of the founding fathers James Madison, George Mason and Benjamin Franklin, Pelosi hewed to a Democratic strategy of framing the impeachment inquiry as a joyless task made imperative by the historic dimensions of Trump\u2019s abuse of power. Republicans have sought to defend Trump by attacking the process by which Democrats have pursued impeachment and criticizing the swift pace of the inquiry, but they so far have not managed a defense of Trump on the merits more substantive than the president\u2019s repeated assertion that his conduct has been \u201cperfect\u201d. In recent days Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, had been surveying her caucus, especially moderate members from swing districts, on their views on impeachment. Support for impeachment nationally jumped sharply after Democrats announced their inquiry in September and then settled to 48-44% support on average, according to FiveThirtyEight. On Thursday, Pelosi, who has the unilateral power to move the impeachment process forward and to dictate its terms, indicated that Democrats in Congress had replied to her query with vocal support for impeachment. \u201cIn the course of today\u2019s events it becomes necessary for us to address, among other grievances, the president\u2019s failure to faithfully uphold the law,\u201d she said. Pelosi spoke after the first day of public impeachment hearings in the judiciary committee, which took up the process after more than a month of work in chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s intelligence committee. Schiff referred the investigation to the judiciary committee on Tuesday with a 300-page report laying out the committee\u2019s finding that Trump had \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d. The judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, said on Wednesday that \u201cnever before has a president engaged in a course of conduct that included all the acts that most concerned the framers\u201d. Republicans on the judiciary committee accused Democrats of rushing the process to impeach Trump before voting begins in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race in February. Pelosi said Congress had no choice but to act because Trump was still trying to subvert the 2020 election. \u201cOur democracy is what is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president leaves us no choice but to act, because he is trying to corrupt once again the election for his own benefit.\u201d Pelosi did not indicate what might be the precise nature of the potential articles of impeachment. Democrats have signalled three possible offenses: abuse of power, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. If Trump were to be impeached in the House, the proceedings would move to the senate for a trial to be presided over by US supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts. About 20 Republican senators would have to defect to convict Trump and remove him from office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
