The provocative piece of theatre, by acclaimed playwright Tom Green, speculates about the legacy of the most famous British politician of the modern age and examines why she is still such a controversial figure. One of the characters is a miner who vows to walk down from the north of England to spit on the former Prime Minister's grave. Another is a newsreader who views the chance to announce Thatcher's death as a career break. Green says he was inspired to write the play by the political rehabilitation of the 82-year-old baroness, who was invited to tea in Downing Street by Gordon Brown last year, and by the contrasting memory of the anger she once provoked. 'I am 37, so definitely one of Thatcher's children,' said Green. 'Unless you were one of her fans, she was a monster, and yet that seems to have changed. The strength of feeling about her is part of Thatcher's iconic status.' The play premieres next month at London's Courtyard Theatre. Producer June Abbott said: 'We were worried about the title at first, but this work puts Baroness Thatcher's death on a par with events such as the death of Kennedy or of Princess Diana. She provokes such emotion. Ever since I have told friends we are doing this play, I have had to sit for hours listening to the views of people who are still either for or against her.' Abbott said Green's play is funny and looks at the way Thatcher polarised opinion. 'It is about how people are affected by her death in different ways. None of them talk about whether they were for or against her.' Lord Tebbit, the former chairman of the Conservative Party who served in Thatcher's government as Trade and Industry Secretary, was dismayed by the decision to stage a play with this sensitive premise. He said: 'The playwright seems to have a problem of comprehension: Margaret Thatcher is not dead. He would have been better to write a play called The Life of Margaret Thatcher which called for her to be reinstated at Number 10.' Green says his work is not overtly political. Instead, he says, it is a response to the strongly worded public promises to celebrate Thatcher's eventual death that have been made in the past by left-wing figures such as the actor Ricky Tomlinson or the singer-songwriter Elvis Costello. 'It will be interesting, when she does die, to see what society makes of it,' he said. 'But this play is not an essay or a polemic. I would not even characterise it as anti-Thatcher.' \u00b7 The Death of Margaret Thatcher runs at the Courtyard Theatre, Hoxton, London N1 from 5 Feb-2 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
