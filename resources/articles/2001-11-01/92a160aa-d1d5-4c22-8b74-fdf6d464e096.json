The owner of the Telegraph and Chicago Sun-Times is planning to reopen the New York Sun, which folded in 1950 after more than 100 years. Black, whose newspaper publishing plans have been the subject of heavy speculation in the last month, has long held a desire to have a foothold in New York. He was hoping to keep his plans secret for some time, but news leaked out in the weekly New York Observer magazine today. In its original guise, the New York Sun was a \"penny dreadful\" - appealing to the working classes with lurid crime stories and pro-immigrant, pro-union views."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
