He paddled out near his Tweed Heads home on Saturday morning, five days after he made global headlines for bravely grappling with a large shark on live TV during the final of a world surfing tour event at Jeffreys Bay. \u201cFirst surf back. Feels so good. Surfed by myself but had Andy in my thoughts. Happy Birthday brother,\u201d Fanning wrote under a silhouetted photo of himself looking out to the ocean, which he posted on Instagram. The picture has already had almost 30,000 likes. The Andy he is referring to is likely American surfer Andy Irons, who was born on 24 July 1978 and died on 2 November 2010. Fanning said it could be months before he gets over the shark attack in South Africa, but that he would return to the water. A shaken Fanning appeared at a media conference of about 150 journalists in Sydney on Tuesday afternoon to recount fighting off the shark. Asked what he would say if he encountered the shark again, Fanning joked he would say, \u201cThanks for not eating me!\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
