He remains tantalisingly poised short of the semi-finals in a tournament he has won a record five times, five months after career-saving hip surgery, and just hours after his Argentinian friend, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, cast doubt on his own future before an operation on his cracked knee-cap. Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez, who beat the No 1 seeds Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah in straight sets on Thursday, went to work in fading light on Friday against the British pair, Dan Evans and Ken Skupski, in another tight thriller. They were 6-4 up and 4-5 down when a high-grade contest was called off under gloomy skies at 8.50pm, half an hour before sunset on the longest day of the year. Had the schedule started rolling just a little earlier than noon, they might have got a result in this quarter-final. The players will resume on Saturday, although squeezing it into an already concertinaed programme will be tricky. L\u00f3pez is in the semi-finals of the singles, mid-afternoon, against the exciting young Canadian, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and the doubles semi is slotted in as the last match on Centre Court. The 37-year-old Spaniard, a champion here in 2017, could end up playing three matches in a row on the same court. Waiting for the delayed winners will be John Peers and Henri Kontinen, who earlier beat Murray\u2019s brother, Jamie, and his new partner, Neal Skupski, Ken\u2019s brother, 7-5, 7-6 (6). Meanwhile, in a downbeat statement from Barcelona, where he will go under the knife on Saturday, Del Potro, whose career has been blighted by injury since he won the US Open 10 years ago, said: \u201cI hope my knee can heal properly. If that match was the last one of my career [beating Denis Shapovolov here], that I don\u2019t know. This is a tough moment. It\u2019s sad to go through all this once again.\u201d A small cloud also drifted across Murray\u2019s world when Nicolas Mahut, the regular doubles partner of Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who will play at Wimbledon with the Scot, presented a grumpy face when asked how he felt about being dumped. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this doubles team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only one who needs to know what I think is Pierre. We talked together but I won\u2019t come into the press to say what I think about this situation.\u201d Herbert was more forthcoming on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s not the cleanest move,\u201d he said. \u201cI will play doubles when I said I wouldn\u2019t. But it is exceptional to play with Murray at Wimbledon.\u201d Mahut will play with \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin at Wimbledon and get back together with Herbert at the US Open. Murray, if he plays at Flushing Meadows in September, might even be ready to play singles. Across the landscape change is in the air. Auger-Aliassime strengthened his credentials as a major new force in the game when he played two superb sets to dislodge the top seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, two years older than him at 20 and equally bristling with promise. The Greek world No 8, a cerebral as well as physical presence, reacted with maturity and insight to the Canadian teenager\u2019s 7-5, 6-2 win in the quarter-finals. \u201cHe\u2019s the most difficult opponent I\u2019ve ever faced,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has one of the best returns on the tour. He has a really powerful, accurate serve, which is tough to read. He\u2019s really quick and fast. It is rare to find all of that combined. He can create a lot of opportunities from his backhand, but also, at the same time, he can be very aggressive from the forehand side. There\u2019s not much to come up with when you play against him.\u201d Tsitsipas predicted Auger-Aliassime could master even the class and experience of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal - a report card the winner could have composed himself \u2013 if he was not such a level-headed young player. Auger-Aliassime, who began the year outside the top 100 and will go to Wimbledon inside the top 20, said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling. I appreciate that from him, because he\u2019s beaten these players. How do I explain it? I think it\u2019s the result of a lot of work over years and months.\u201d On Saturday he plays L\u00f3pez, who is more than twice his age and who played solidly but with dashes of flair to end the run of Auger-Aliassime\u2019s compatriot, Milos Raonic, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) in two hours 16 minutes. Another voice from the past stirred briefly when John McEnroe joined the queue to offer advice to the troubled Nick Kyrgios, fined $17,500 for three incidents of unsportsmanlike conduct in two matches on Thursday. \u201cI have talked with him,\u201d said McEnroe, whose own crime sheet was long enough. \u201cNick is a good guy. I think the people around him like him. The players like him [apart from Auger-Aliassime, it seems]. They don\u2019t like what he does on the court sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he could even say, \u2018I like the fact that I try half the time.\u2019 I mean, how could anyone think that? I don\u2019t think it just has to be him [who deals with his problem]. I wasn\u2019t known as the easiest person to deal with. \u201cTo me, that [other] person has to be ready to embrace whoever that is. They have to be willing to listen to [him]. If you are not going to listen, he is doing what he wants to do. \u201cHe\u2019s 24 years old. He brings an electricity to tennis. That\u2019s why everyone is trying to figure a way to work through this \u2013 so he can get to a place where he can go out and feel free to compete and give the effort. That\u2019s the part that gnaws at the players. I don\u2019t care if he throws a chair on the court or does what he does. \u201cThe part that I have a problem with \u2013 and I am assuming 99 per cent of the rest of the Tour do \u2013 is when you go out there and don\u2019t seem like you are giving an effort half of the time ... for whatever reason. But I am not Sigmund Freud.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
