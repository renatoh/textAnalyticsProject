The Teenage Cancer Trust wants boys aged 13 to 24 to be offered the HPV (human papillomavirus) jab, now that it is to be routine for them to get it at the age of 12, alongside girls. \u201cWhile it\u2019s great some boys from this year onwards will have the same protection against HPV-related cancers that teenage girls and women have had for a decade, a generation of teenage boys and young men are being denied that chance,\u201d said the trust\u2019s chief executive, Kate Collins. \u201cParents of school-age boys may well find one child will get the HPV vaccine for free, whereas an older son will only be protected if they can afford to pay for it. That simply isn\u2019t fair, and the cost of around \u00a3150 per dose is unaffordable for many. \u201cNot vaccinating older teenage boys puts them at risk as it relies on the false presumption they will only have sexual partners who don\u2019t have HPV. It undermines the UK\u2019s progress on reducing HPV-linked cancers, such as cervical cancer, as this \u2018missing generation\u2019 of boys can get and share HPV with others who\u2019ve not been vaccinated. And it contradicts the NHS\u2019s own message that universal vaccinations are for the common good.\u201d The HPV vaccine protects girls against the virus that is the main cause of cervical cancer. It has reduced the main circulating strains of HPV by 80% since the programme began in 2008. Immunising boys will help reduce the presence of the sexually transmitted virus in circulation still further. However, immunising boys will have direct benefits for them as well. HPV also causes about 90% of anal cancers and 50% of penile cancers, and some cancers of the head and neck, as well as about 90% of genital warts. The HPV school vaccination programme will be open to boys in years 8 to 12 for the first time from September. When the programme began for girls a decade ago, the vaccine was also offered to older girls and young women. The Teenage Cancer Trust says that should happen for boys and young men now. The charity\u2019s own survey shows that 76% of teenage boys and young men aged 13 to 24 would want the vaccine if they were offered it for free on the NHS. If they had to pay, however, nearly half (46%) would not get it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
