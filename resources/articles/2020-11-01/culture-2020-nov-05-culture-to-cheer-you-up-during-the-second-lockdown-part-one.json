The Harlem Gospel Travellers \u2013 He\u2019s on Time A confirmed diabolist would struggle not to have their spirits lifted by the Harlem Gospel Travellers, the product of an education programme to introduce New York youth to the sound of classic gospel: lo-fi production, soaring, gorgeous vocals, music that turns from soothing to raucous. Various artists \u2013 76 in the Shade Another means of transporting yourself: a superlative compilation designed to evoke \u201cthe sweet heat, the almost narcotic lethargy\u201d of the summer of 1976 \u2013 and to reconsider the year as something more than a dead zone prelude to punk. Stirs forgotten soul, pop, soft rock and library music into a dreamy mix. Bdrmm \u2013 Bedroom A debut album on a tiny label, Bedroom attracted a surprising amount of attention during the first lockdown, but you can see why: Bdrmm sound fantastic \u2013 a dense mesh of effects-heavy guitars somewhere between shoegazing and 80s Cure. Moreover, the lyrics fit the times: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t try and keep my shit together / This whole ordeal just took over.\u201d Prince \u2013 Sign O\u2019 The Times deluxe edition If not now, when? The deluxe version of Prince\u2019s 1987 masterpiece comes groaning with so many extra tracks \u2013 of a startlingly high quality \u2013 that it lasts eight hours. There are worse ways to spend time on your hands than luxuriating in the torrential outpouring of a genius at the height of his powers. Alexis Petridis Games Kind Words An ambient game you can keep open on your computer on stressful days, Kind Words lets you write down your worries and send them out into the universe \u2013 and receive encouraging letters back from strangers. Reading and sending these anonymous missives is cheering, and can help keep all our troubles in perspective. \u2022 Available on PC and Mac. Animal Crossing The star game of the first lockdown is already enjoying another surge in popularity, as people seek a peaceful, soothing island escape from their own homes. It\u2019s now autumn in the game as well, with warm colours, cosy jumpers, and mushrooms and acorns to forage for. \u2022 Available on Nintendo Switch. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Sometimes you just need to punch things, and in Spider-Man you can do so guiltlessly whilst swinging around a ludicrously beautiful Manhattan. So frictionless and easy to play that you can disappear into it for hours without having to engage your brain much. A new version starring Miles Morales has just been released. \u2022 Available on Playstation 4 and 5. No Man\u2019s Sky An entire universe awaits in this chill space-exploration game, which you can play either by yourself like a tragic stranded astronaut, or with friends for a more social time. Flying through space, landing on new planets and building bases to work from is absorbing, and there\u2019s relatively little peril. \u2022 Available on PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, Xbox Series S &amp; X, Xbox One A Short Hike A brief, sweet, cheerful and lovable game about a bird trying to climb a mountain. Inspired by creator Adam Robinson\u2019s real-world hikes and playful video game adventures of the 90s, it\u2019s got beautiful autumnal colours, irreverent chit-chat and an invigorating sense of freedom, letting you explore without pressure. \u2022 Available on PC, Mac and Nintendo Switch. Keza MacDonald Books Reasons to Be Cheerful, by Nina Stibbe Lizzie, bright but unworldly, has just turned 18 and is working as a dental assistant in 1980 Leicester. Winner of the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction and the Comedy Women in Print prize, this is the sort of book you want to keep reading bits of aloud to people just because it\u2019s so delightful. The Thursday Murder Club, by Richard Osman Elizabeth, Ibrahim, Ron and Joyce (who is the type who \u201cgets things done\u201d) live in an exclusive retirement village in Kent, where they meet every Thursday to investigate unsolved murder cases (\u201cvery social, but also gory\u201d) \u2013 until a real killer lands on their doorstep. This cosy crime caper from the Pointless presenter is a genuine pleasure: charming, amusing and affectionate. The Private Joys of Nnenna Maloney, by Okechukwu Nzelu Nnenna, who has grown up in Manchester, starts asking questions about Maurice, the Nigerian father her white mother Joanie refuses to discuss. Moving between timelines \u2013 as Joanie and Maurice meet in Cambridge, and as Nnenna tries to find her own way forward \u2013 this debut is snort-out-loud funny, effortlessly insightful and heart-warmingly tender. Mr Wilder and Me, by Jonathan Coe The latest novel from the author of What a Carve Up! and Middle England follows the Greek-born film-score composer Calista, who is now in her 50s. As her children prepare to leave home, and she ponders her own life, she looks back on the time she worked for Hollywood director Billy Wilder as a young woman. Tender and bittersweet, it is \u201cas good as anything he\u2019s written \u2013 a novel to cherish\u201d, said the Observer. His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust, by Philip Pullman There\u2019s a new story about Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon just out, in Serpentine, so what better excuse to revisit the world(s) of Pullman\u2019s greatest creation, Lyra Silvertongue? It\u2019s your choice whether that\u2019s via His Dark Materials, and Pullman\u2019s exquisite rendering of the pain and wonder of growing up, or his expansion of her story in The Book of Dust, but I\u2019d recommend both. After all, we have the time now\u2026 Alison Flood Television Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt It doesn\u2019t sound like much of a comedy premise \u2013 30-year-old woman is freed from a bunker where she\u2019s been held by a religious nutcase for 15 years and must relearn how to live \u2013 BUT! Two things. One: the setup now feels like an uncanny metaphor for 2020. And two: it is, against all the odds, very, very funny. And warm, charming and uplifting. You need it. \u2022 Available on Netflix I May Destroy You Why not use your enforced viewing time to watch the best drama of the year (the decade, possibly longer) and a landmark in television history? Watch someone \u2013 writer and star Michaela Coel \u2013 push the boundaries of an art form and create something compelling, interrogative, new and brilliant? It will feed your soul. \u2022 Available on BBC iPlayer Silicon Valley An underrated comedy by Mike Judge about a group of coders attempting to become a groundbreaking tech force in the mad world of Palo Alto. It doesn\u2019t matter if you know or care nothing about computers \u2013 the characters are real, the performances are flawless, and you\u2019ll learn a little about compression algorithms along the way. \u2022 Available on Sky Atlantic/Now TV The Boys What if you monetised superheroes? That\u2019s the question at the heart of this series based on Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson\u2019s comic book, and the answer is a dark, sinewy, bitterly funny series with gory action aplenty to keep the existential despair at back. \u2022 Available on Amazon Prime Video The Queen\u2019s Gambit Utterly gorgeous to look at, this adaptation of Walter Tevis\u2019s bestseller about an orphan chess prodigy battling grandmasters at the same time as addiction is the perfect escapist, rags-to-riches tale at a time when we all need to believe there is something better within us and out in the world. The most bingeable, comforting new series around. \u2022 Available on Netflix Lucy Mangan Dance Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater A whole evening programme from the New York company, including the legendary Revelations, Ailey\u2019s signature work rooted in the African-American experience, set to spirituals, blues and gospel. It comes from a place of struggle, but it\u2019s ultimately one of the most spiritually uplifting pieces of dance out there. \u2022 Available on YouTube Bolshoi Ballet: Flames of Paris French Revolution-set ballet that\u2019s like Les Mis on pointe shoes. Bit of a slow start, but once it revs up with full revolutionary zeal, it\u2019s a rip-roaring ride. Explosive leads Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev fly across the stage with the Russians showing off what they do so well: virtuoso, escapist entertainment. \u2022 Available on Medici TV/Marquee TV, subscription required Top Hat A hidden gem on iPlayer, Top Hat is pure delight and arguably Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers\u2019 best film. Astaire\u2019s tap solo in No Strings is a blinder. Rogers turns up at the door and he tries to charm: \u201cEvery once in a while I suddenly find myself \u2026 dancing.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she says, unimpressed. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s some sort of an affliction.\u201d \u2022 Available on BBC iPlayer Flavorama 2020 The determination of dancers to keep dancing throughout this pandemic sends hope to the heart. One outlet is the online dance battle, played out over Instagram. It makes for a bitty format, but the passion of this global community of dancers comes through. For feelgood vibes, house dance is the go-to style. \u2022 Available on Instagram World Ballet Day 2020 29 October was World Ballet Day, and in a cheering spirit of international celebration, 40 ballet companies from Cape Town to Queensland took part in a 24-hour live stream. Just seeing the world\u2019s best dancers up close and behind the scenes, going through the grit, grace and precision beauty of their training is mesmerising, inspiring stuff. \u2022 Available online Lyndsey Winship Visual art Arctic This delightful exhibition of Arctic life takes you into the ingenious, creative lifestyles of the peoples who live in perpetual winter. Although it is temporarily closing, the website offers several nice ways to engage with Arctic history and culture, from top objects to advice on conserving fish-skin bags. The catalogue is well worth getting. \u2022 Available online Tracey Emin\u2019s The Ship This mighty new painting is in the Royal Academy\u2019s summer show, now closed, and it lifted my heart with its energy, passion and rough beauty. There\u2019s a good image of it that you can enjoy online and be moved by Emin\u2019s ability to put her life and feelings on canvas. She channels Turner, as a ship appears to materialise in her bath in a storm of emotion. \u2022 Available online The Romantics and Us with Simon Schama You can visit the Louvre in Schama\u2019s engrossing company to look deeply into G\u00e9ricault\u2019s The Raft of the Medusa and Delacroix\u2019s Liberty Leading the People, as he boldly traces modern politics and art to their roots around 1800. His encounter with Victor Hugo\u2019s eerie drawings is revelatory as his enthusiastic exploration of the Romantics\u2019 appetite for drugs. Which might of course be another lockdown idea. \u2022 Available on BBC iPlayer Andy Warhol: Love, Sex and Desire It\u2019s hard to believe Warhol\u2019s early drawings were once regarded as trivial and irrelevant to his later career. This book celebrates their sensuality. His clear lines delineate tenderly adored male beauty in a style reminiscent of Jean Cocteau. Far from the cold voyeur his critics made him out to be, he emerges here as a lyrical draughtsman of unabashed eroticism. \u2022 Published by Taschen, \u00a375 Caravaggio. Il contemporaneo One good thing about retreating online is that international exhibitions are just as accessible as local ones. This provocative show in northern Italy has a decent online presence and is uplifting if you like art that\u2019s searingly alive. Caravaggio\u2019s great Sicilian altarpiece The Burial of St Lucy is juxtaposed with modern works, including images of the murdered Pasolini and the gory rites of Hermann Nitsch. Goes well with the National Gallery\u2019s Artemisia. \u2022 Available online Jonathan Jones"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
