In accordance with that principle, the following shall be observed in 2014. Politics Conservatives must pretend to be united behind David Cameron while constantly speculating about who will replace him. In the event that the Tory unity looks too credible, backbench MPs should rebel over Europe. All new policies must be tough. The hierarchy of things down upon which the government intends to crack is as follows: waste, red tape, the Human Rights Act, benefit fraud, other crime, welfare claimants having multiple children, immigration, foreign criminals supported by European judges using the human rights act to have excess children on the NHS. It is forbidden for Labour MPs to say anything interesting. Permitted Labour phrases are \"Out-of-touch Tory-led government\" and \"Cost-of-living crisis hurting hardworking families\". In emergencies, opposition MPs may also point out that: \"You can't trust the Tories with the NHS.\" In spring, Labour holds a special conference on reforms to the party's links with trade unions. These must be viewed from the right as craven capitulation to socialist militancy and from the left as betrayal of the working classes dictated by a phalanx of Blairite ultras. Liberal Democrats should pretend that they have made a great difference in coalition and that opinion polls are masking hidden wells of gratitude in the seats they hold. Lib Dem MPs who aren't ministers should pretend they are in opposition and distance themselves from everything the Tories say. Lib Dem MPs who are ministers should use their contacts to line up nice jobs outside politics for after the next election. European elections in May The rule is to debate the issues on terms dictated by Ukip and to then affect surprise when they do well. At least one Ukip candidate must be revealed as having opinions that would be considered reactionary in a medieval cleric. This will have no impact on the party's poll performance. The Daily Telegraph should feature at least one picture of Nigel Farage holding a pint of beer and smoking a cigar for every day of the campaign. At least one senior European Union official or diplomat from a major EU country must express with delicacy and nuance a modicum of concern at the xenophobic direction that Britain appears to be taking. He must then be universally pilloried as an ignorant meddling foreign devil. Within days of the European election results being declared, commentators must write their \"Has Ukip peaked?\" columns. Within minutes of the European election results being declared, Grant Shapps must appear on television saying the Tories didn't do as badly as predicted and that the real story is Labour's disastrous performance. Scottish independence vote The rule here is confidently to predict a\"no\" vote until the summer, whereupon it is mandatory to panic and predict a surprise \"yes\" vote before settling on the line that it is too close to call. At least one senior Tory is obliged to make a crass intervention, ostensibly in defence of the union but likely to boost the independence campaign. First World War centenary 2014 is the year to get really bored with Great War anniversary commemorations but to be afraid to say so for fear of sounding disrespectful. World Cup 2014 The media should speculate about Brazil's readiness to host the World Cup, using images of derelict-looking stadiums. It's mandatory to talk as if England might win. Brazil will be ready; England will not win. Rest of the world There should be sporadic flashes of interest in events beyond Britain's shores. These must not be sustained for longer than three days. If there are political upheavals threatening regime change in distant countries, disproportionate attention must be paid to the role played by Twitter in the revolution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
