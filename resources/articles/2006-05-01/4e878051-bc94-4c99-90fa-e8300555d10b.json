Security officers attacked demonstrators, dragging some away. Three plainclothes police beat a photographer working for Reuters, confiscating one camera and smashing another, and an al-Jazeera cameraman was badly beaten. Mahmoud Mekky and Hesham Bastawisi, the judges, have refused to attend the hearing, which was adjourned for a week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
