But the Saracens hooker Robbie Russell, nursing a sickening wound needing six stitches below his left eye at the end of this calamitous home defeat, would have disagreed. There was more bad blood than in a Godfather film. Leicester secured a 17-point lead at the top of the Premiership after their biggest league win of the season, outscoring Saracens by seven tries to one, but their Saturday night was soured by yet another incident involving their England and Lions captain Martin Johnson. Johnson's yellow card will mean no citing, so he will escape further disciplinary action for a right upper-cut that landed him and the Scot Russell in the sin-bin 13 minutes into the second half. We have been this way before. Last season Johnson was banned for five weeks for an incident in a cup game between these sides at Welford Road which ended with Saracens' Australian fly-half Duncan McRae nursing broken ribs. McRae was to commit even worse thuggery in Sydney last summer when he pummelled his opposite number Ronan O'Gara in the Lions match against New South Wales Waratahs. Johnson's short fuse is continually undermining his good name, though. When Russell tried to claim the ball back from the lock after Leicester had conceded a second-half penalty, the pair brawled and Russell was given a thump for his troubles. The Tigers' enforcer should have seen red, and the fact that Leicester were 24-0 up at the time compounded Johnson's felony. Francois Pienaar, the Saracens chief executive, was quick to wade into the post-match verbal maul. \"It was disgraceful that Robbie was only trying to secure the ball and ended up with stitches in his face for his pains. Johnson was lucky not to be sent off. \"It is frustrating; Leicester were continually giving away penalties and Adryan Winnan was also punched. This is not sour grapes and I don't want to belittle Leicester because they played some great rugby but, if you throw a punch, then you can expect a red card and I think that, if Johnsopn wasn't the England captain, he would have received one.\" Richards defended Johnson, claiming he was taken out from behind. \"Over the years Johnno has been penalised more than most and Saracens should look at themselves before they make accusations.\" There was needle from the kick-off when Darren Garforth was penalised for fighting at a ruck and Jannie de Beer missed the first of three penalty attempts. It set the tone for an evening in which Saracens were comprehensively outplayed - from the moment Leicester scored a trademark try in the 10th minute when Johnson took a lineout and Neil Back was driven over, to when Steve Booth scorched through for a final try in the last minute. The entire Saracens team looked punch drunk by the end and a late try from Nick Walshe was no consolation. It was no way for Richard Hill, Johnson's England and Lions colleague, to celebrate his 200th game. Hill was presented with a cap by the club director Nigel Wray and the flanker did his best to make a dignified speech as Leicester gave their fans a little lap of honour. Wray's patience must be wearing thin. He recently took the unprecedented step of writing to the club's season-ticket holders apologising for the team's displays. There were no apologies from Leicester, though, on a less than perfect night which saw their England No8 Martin Corry limp off with an ankle injury at the interval.
