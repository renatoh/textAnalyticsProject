As Black Lives Matter protests sweep the world in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Natalie Diaz \u2013 a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d grant recipient and former professional basketball player \u2013 writes in her collection, Postcolonial Love Poem, of police violence against Native Americans. In her poem American Arithmetic, she notes that \u201cNative Americans make up less than / 1 percent of the population of America\u201d, but \u201cPolice kill Native Americans more / than any other race\u201d. \u201cRace is a funny word. / Race implies someone will win, / implies, I have as good a chance of winning as \u2013 // Who wins the race that isn\u2019t a race?\u201d she asks. Diaz, who was born in Fort Mojave Indian Village in California, says that the poem \u201cwas written in acknowledgment of, solidarity with, and in conversation with the police violence perpetrated against all black and brown people in the United States\u201d, adding that her poetry is a demand for \u201ca different visibility, one that makes my nation uncomfortable \u2013 my speakers refused to be defined by their wounds and would instead sow them and reap light from them\u201d. Postcolonial Love Poem is up against four other titles for the \u00a310,000 prize. David Morley is nominated for FURY, which takes its title from the boxer Tyson Fury and includes verbatim quotes from him: \u201cNothing\u2019s talked about in my family \u2026 we just give each other a punch.\u201d Vicki Feaver\u2019s I Want! I Want!, her fourth collection in 40 years, draws its title from William Blake\u2019s illustration of a child reaching for the moon, and moves from her childhood ambition to be a poet, to becoming a woman \u201cburied under ice with words burning inside\u201d. Pascale Petit is nominated for Tiger Girl, an exploration of her grandmother\u2019s Indian heritage growing up near the forests of Ranthambore in Rajasthan, as is Caroline Bird\u2019s The Air Year, named for the time before the first, or \u201cpaper\u201d, anniversary in a relationship. Chair of judges and social historian Alexandra Harris said the judging process had coincided almost exactly with the first two months of lockdown. \u201cNone of the books were written for a pandemic, but it was noticeable how often a strong poem would seem as true to the hour and the day as the constantly updated news,\u201d she said, describing the collections on the shortlist as \u201crich in energy and surprise, intellectually agile, sensuous, made to last\u201d. Harris said that almost everyone had been turning to poetry over the course of the spring, with even Vanity Fair going so far as to identify the coronavirus pandemic as \u201ca moment\u201d for the art form. \u201cPoetry had a moment that lasted through both world wars. It has a moment whenever there is pressure and threat, and whenever we want to think carefully \u2013 together or individually,\u201d she said. \u201cIn times of distraction it can carve out a space of concentration. Poems can shake or shock or magnetise our ideas into new configurations.\u201d The five collections in the running for the \u00a35,000 Felix Dennis prize for best first collection have also been announced, including Will Harris\u2019s debut RENDANG, an exploration of his Anglo-Indonesian heritage, and Nina Mingya Powles\u2019s Magnolia \u6728\u862d, which sees her writing of Disney\u2019s film Mulan, and learning the Mandarin of her grandparents. Last year\u2019s best collection winner Fiona Benson is nominated for the \u00a31,000 prize for best poem with her poem, Mama Cockroach, I Love You, as is previous nominee Malika Booker and the Belarusian poet Valzhyna Mort. The winners will be announced on 25 October. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the awards are launching a Meet the Poet online series, which will feature readings from the shortlisted books and the chance to ask the poets about their work. Herbert said the initiative was partly inspired by 2014 Forward prizes judge Jeremy Paxman, who called for a \u201cPoetry Inquisition\u201d so the public could \u2018\u201cask poets to explain why they chose to write about the particular subject they wrote about, and why they chose the particular form and language, idiom, the rest of it\u201d. \u201cAt last! A chance to ask poets what they\u2019re on about. It\u2019s been too long,\u201d said Paxman of the new initiative.
