Redknapp emerged from the Luka Modric to Chelsea saga in the summer still hanging on to the Croatian playmaker and with a side he rates as stronger than the one that powered Tottenham into the Champions League for the first time two seasons ago. The arrival of Scott Parker and Emmanuel Adebayor strengthened midfield and attack but with the Premier League title still surely beyond the club's reach Redknapp may well be wondering where his first trophy for Spurs will come from as he enters a fourth year in charge at White Hart Lane. Regaining entry into the continent's premier club competition is the priority, so the answer does not appear to be the Europa League. His selection reflected this in a side that contained only four first-choice players and featured Jake Livermore, a midfielder by trade, in central defence due to an injury crisis among the back four. \"I find it [the Europa League] difficult because it has so many games and so much travelling and then you've got Thursday and Saturday [for games], so you've got to juggle with your squad.\" Against a Rubin Kazan side that arrived with the same number of points \u2013 four \u2013 as Spurs and who headed Group A on goal difference, it was Roman Pavlyuchenko, seemingly intent on reminding Redknapp of his talents, who opened up hostilities. His wander from midfield towards Sergey Ryzhikov's goal was followed by a 30-yard shot that went wide to the keeper's right. This effort preceded a number of chances for the Russian visitors. From a corner Roman Sharonov outjumped Livermore to the header but it was steered wide. Gokdeniz Karadeniz sent over a diagonal cross from the left that removed Danny Rose from the equation and found Bibras Natkho's head, forcing Heurelho Gomes to make a sharp save from point-blank range. Salvatore Bocchetti found Nelson Valdez with a swinging ball from the left but he could not finish. Spurs were unable to assert themselves in midfield with the 19-year-old Tom Carroll and Sandro watching proceedings pass through them. Pavlyuchenko, though, was about to blast Spurs into the lead. Rose drew a foul on the edge of the area and up stepped the Russia striker to rattle the 25-yard free-kick into the top left-hand corner of Ryzhikov's goal. Pavlyuchenko would end the half brushing the keeper's fingertips with a fine effort. Spurs resumed after the break with attempts from Pavlyuchenko and S\u00e9bastien Bassong, before Gomes was forced to save from Alan Kasaev. The Spurs keeper then flapped at the resulting corner. In what was now an open contest Rubin Kazan became the dominant force. Alexander Ryazantsev had enough space to test Gomes and the keeper had to punch away further danger. Aaron Lennon decided to dally in the left-back position and, when he was dispossessed, the ball broke to Christiano Noboa, who should have equalised. Yet, as the contest neared its end, Spurs again rallied and Defoe should have finished from Lennon's cross before he was replaced by Modric. A sense grew that, if momentum builds after Christmas, Redknapp may begin to eye doubling his total of major silverware (following the FA Cup he won at Portsmouth in 2008) by collecting a trophy an English club really should be able to win, given the riches of the Premier League. But the manager is still not convinced. \"It's a juggling act between the Europa League and the Premier League and we want to do well in this competition but the Premier League is all important for us, that is what we get judged on at the end of the year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
