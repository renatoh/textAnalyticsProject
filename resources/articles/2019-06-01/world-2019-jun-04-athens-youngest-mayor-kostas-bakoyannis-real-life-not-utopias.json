What he prefers to focus on is \u201creal life\u201d \u2013 and seeing it by walking and talking with almost everyone he meets. It has paid off. After visiting 129 neighbourhoods across Athens since launching his campaign to become the capital\u2019s youngest mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis, at 41, has been catapulted to the top office of City Hall with the widest margin of victory ever. With him comes a team of councillors that will be among the most politically diverse on record. \u201cWhat interests me is real life, which is making sure everyone\u2019s daily life is better,\u201d the centrist politician said, having secured 65% of the vote, a 30-point lead over his nearest rival, in Sunday\u2019s run-off local government elections. \u201cThat might mean focusing on cleanliness, garbage collection, lighting, things that Athens has fallen behind on, things that make a difference and other capitals take for granted. Greek politicians may like to talk up big, eternal issues but frankly they are above our pay grade.\u201d Tall and lean with a penchant for wristbands, Bakoyannis is the scion of Greece\u2019s leading political dynasty \u2013 one that is being increasingly compared to the Kennedys. As he was the product of a British boarding school and Ivy League colleges in the US, including Harvard where he went on to do graduate work, the lure of politics seemed inevitable. Equally inevitable were charges of nepotism. His uncle Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to whom he bears an uncanny likeness, heads the centre-right opposition party, New Democracy. His mother, Dora, was Athens mayor before becoming foreign minister. His grandfather, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, led New Democracy, serving as prime minister from 1990 to 1993. But Bakoyannis, who was mayor of Karpenisi before becoming governor of central Greece, a region encompassing 25 municipalities, has not been shy of criticising politicians past and present. Under his stewardship, the mountainous area became a champion in absorption of EU funds, money that enabled infrastructure projects to transform parts of one of Europe\u2019s poorest districts. \u201cI have been in local government for 10 years. I think I have reached a point where people can look at what I have done and not my name,\u201d says Bakoyannis, who has been married twice and has four children. \u201cThe trash in Karpenisi wasn\u2019t collected by [Mitsotakis]; the public works weren\u2019t my mother\u2019s. Everyone focuses on one half of my family. They never focus on my other grandfather, my father\u2019s father, who was a priest in a rural village.\u201d In a poll noticeable for abstention rates that reached 60%, New Democracy emerged triumphant in regions and cities nationwide, routing the ruling leftists in a replay of its performance in European elections. Before a snap general election next month \u2013 called by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, after last week\u2019s humiliating defeat - the centre-right opposition won 11 of the country\u2019s 13 administrative regions and the vast majority of municipalities. In Attica, where nearly 30% of voters are registered, the conservative-backed Giorgos Patoulis trounced Rena Dourou, a prominent member of Syriza who had been regional governor since 2014. But while Bakoyannis says taking up a post previously held by his mother heralds a new political era, he emphasises that his team transcends the entrenched political divisions that have long defined Greece. In the wake of almost a decade of financial crisis \u2013 one that hit Athens hardest as the capital on the frontline of austerity reeled from protests, strikes and riots \u2013 consensus has never been needed more. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we are about bridging differences and forging alliances with everyone,\u201d says the young mayor-elect whose politician father, Pavlos, was murdered 30 years ago by the far-left terrorist group November 17. \u201cPolitics shouldn\u2019t be about fear, division and demagoguery, it should be about bringing people together. Ours is a team that crosses parties and political ideology in every way, and that\u2019s because we want to work from the bottom up, not the top down.\u201d With polls projecting victory for the conservatives in the 7 July snap elections, Mitsotakis has also sought to sound a note of consensus. A liberal reformist at the helm of a party comprised of factions that range from the nationalist to the populist right, the electoral wins, and unexpected margin of defeat for Syriza, have vindicated a leader who at times has faced criticism from within his own ranks. As it became clear candidates supported by New Democracy had swept the nation, the 51-year-old politician underscored the need for national unity, declaring: \u201cThe map has been painted blue but, in this case, blue is not the colour of our party but of our country.\u201d Conceding defeat, Tsipras told supporters it was \u201cimportant in life to learn how to win and how to lose\u201d. The leftist leader, who will call on the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, on 10 June to request that parliament be dissolved and the process for early elections formally initiated, said Syriza would rally its forces for \u201cthe mother of all battles\u201d. The seat of Athens mayor has long been seen as a stepping stone to a career in central government. Bakoyannis\u2019s predecessor, Giorgos Kaminis, has gone on to become a candidate for the centre-left Kinal (Movement for Change) party. But while Kaminis did much to promote Athens internationally \u2013 helping turn it into a much-visited tourist destination after years of crisis \u2013 he has also been criticised for not doing enough to improve the quality of services for citizens. \u201cLocal politics is where I am staying,\u201d says Bakoyannis who, perhaps buoyed and bowled over by his success, hastens to add that no mayor in the history of modern Athens has ever won with such a large mandate. \u201cThere is something very rewarding about coming up with real solutions to real problems in the form of tangible and visible results. \u201cThe moment you see me not walking the streets, not talking to people, not listening to their problems or hearing their views, you should know that that\u2019s when I will have failed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
