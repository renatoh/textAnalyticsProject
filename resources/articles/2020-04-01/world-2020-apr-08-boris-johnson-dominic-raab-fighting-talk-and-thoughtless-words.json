But if they do it won\u2019t be due to some steely inner quality of theirs, but because of a combination of luck and excellent medical care. I am tired of politicians and commentators telling us Boris Johnson is a \u201cfighter\u201d, \u201cvery determined\u201d or \u201cstrong\u201d, as if all those who have succumbed, including medical and care staff, were victims of some personal weakness or absence of determination. Isabella Stone Sheffield \u2022 Dominic Raab says Boris Johnson will \u201cpull through\u201d his health crisis \u201cbecause if there\u2019s one thing I know about this prime minister, he\u2019s a fighter\u201d (Boris Johnson to stay in hospital amid concerns over political vacuum, 7 April). This blather implies that anyone who does not \u201cpull through\u201d is not \u201ca fighter\u201d. Did he think of the effect of his words on anyone who has lost a loved one to coronavirus? Liam McAuley Booterstown, Co Dublin, Ireland \u2022 A bit cruel to put a picture of Dominic Raab under a headline referring to a \u201cpolitical vacuum\u201d.
