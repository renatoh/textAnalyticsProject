Focusing on small collections across the arts and sciences, the AHRB's Project Fund will be shared by 21 institutions. \"We wanted to help important but under-resourced collections,\" said Professor David Eastwood, chief executive of the AHRB. \"The new Project Fund awards will allow the development of collections for the benefit of teaching and research, and improve access for the wider public.\" Grants of up to \u00a330,000 per institution will provide resources for the conservation, cataloguing and display of museum exhibits. Award-holders can also use the money to undertake collaborations with other collections. The AHRB took over responsibility for the funding of higher education museums and gallery collections from Hefce in 1998. It now provides more than \u00a39m per year for their maintenance. The awards are open to those collections previously funded by Hefce that were not involved in earlier rounds of core and developmental awards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
