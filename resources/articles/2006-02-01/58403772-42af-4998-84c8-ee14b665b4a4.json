But chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier, reporting GSK's best set of results since it was created by the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000, said the group did not need deals at any price: \"We are not hooked on acquisitions.\" The Pfizer unit is the world's second-largest consumer healthcare business, its stable of well-known brand names including Listerine and Sudafed. Pfizer confirmed this week it is \"exploring strategic alternatives\" for the business. Mr Garnier said: \"We will be one of the many companies looking at the material [on Pfizer] but there is no guarantee that we will bid for it. We are going to take a look and decide later. We look at everything that is for sale but are very circumspect on what we buy. If the acquisition gets us into a fast growing business, then we are interested.\" Although admitting an interest in the Pfizer business, he refused to comment on any ambitions for the Swiss biotechnology group Serono, which was put up for sale last year and could command a price of $11bn. Mr Garnier's comments came as GSK reported a better-than-expected 2005 performance with a particularly strong final quarter. Helped by higher sales of core drugs such as Advair for asthma and the diabetes treatment Avandia, group sales rose 8% to \u00a321.66bn. Pre-tax profits for the year jumped 16% to \u00a36.7bn and earnings per share were ahead 21% at 82.6p. Mr Garnier predicted a 10% increase in earnings this year, but said that forecast was conservative. The group, Europe's largest drug maker, gave a keenly awaited update on its potential blockbuster cervical cancer vaccine, Cervarix. It will file for regulatory approval in Europe in the next few weeks and in the United States by the end of the year. The drug could prevent more than three quarters of cervical cancer cases but rival Merck is ahead in the race to bring a product to market, having already filed in Europe and the US for its Gardasil. GSK has one of the strongest pipelines of new products in the pharmaceutical industry, including a prototype flu vaccine which uses the H5N1 bird flu strain that is spreading from Asia to Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
