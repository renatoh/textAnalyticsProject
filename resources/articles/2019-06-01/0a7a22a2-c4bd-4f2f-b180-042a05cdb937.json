The environmental audit committee said the UK is sabotaging its climate credentials by paying out \u201cunacceptably high\u201d fossil fuel subsidies to developing nations, while claiming to lead world in tackling the climate crisis. It called on ministers to stop by 2021 using taxpayer funds to lock poorer nations into a fossil fuel future. The rebuke is the clearest cross-party criticism of the UK\u2019s fossil fuel subsidies and comes after mounting international criticism in recent months. Environmental activist Greta Thunberg said in April the UK\u2019s \u201cactive, current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels\u201d was \u201cabsurd\u201d. The audit committee report found that UK Export Finance (UKEF), which provides lines of credit and insurance to help companies win business overseas, spent \u00a32.6bn in recent years to support the UK\u2019s global energy exports, of which \u00a32.5bn was handed to fossil fuel projects. Only 4% of its funding, or \u00a3104m, was used to support renewable energy projects. Earlier this year, former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on the UK to stop funding fossil fuel projects in the developing world. He told the committee that UKEF needs \u201crecalibration\u201d to meet international climate trends and obligations. Mary Creagh, the committee\u2019s chair, described the UK\u2019s record as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cThe government claims that the UK is a world leader on tackling climate change, but behind the scenes the UK\u2019s export finance schemes are handing out billions of pounds of taxpayers money to develop fossil fuel projects in poorer countries,\u201d she said. One of the largest projects included a deal to pay half a billion pounds to the UK subsidiary of a Turkish construction company to build two \u201ccritical\u201d gas-fired power plants in Iraq. The report said Enka UK registered as a UK company a year before its funding deal but does not have an office, staff or operations in the UK. It told the committee it plans to open an office in Birmingham for a staff of 12. A spokesman for UKEF said the government \u201cfully recognises the importance of tackling climate change\u201d and the need \u201cfor a mix of energy sources and technologies as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy\u201d. In the committee\u2019s report Louis Taylor, the chief executive of UKEF, defended the agency\u2019s support for gas-fired power plants as part of a climate \u201ctransition\u201d because it has half the carbon footprint of coal. The report emerged days before the government is expected to legislate an ambitious target to reduce the UK\u2019s net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. The government\u2019s official climate adviser, the committee on climate change, warned last month that \u201cexport finance is not aligned with climate goals, and often supports high-carbon investments\u201d. The UK is also vying to host the UN\u2019s most important climate talks since the Paris agreement next year to draw attention to its climate ambitions. Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth said it crucial that the UK\u2019s finance agency \u201cis divested completely from planet-wrecking fossil fuels\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard our government\u2019s shouting from the rooftops around ambition on emissions reduction in the UK, but for too long this has simply meant outsourcing a lot of high carbon projects overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t solve a crisis by simply moving it somewhere else to make your own numbers look good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
