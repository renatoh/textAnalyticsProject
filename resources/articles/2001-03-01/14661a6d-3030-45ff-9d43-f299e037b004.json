In a big embarrassment for the Conservative leadership, Mr Hannan has voiced strong support for Turkish North Cyprus which has been protecting the former Tory benefactor, Asil Nadir, since he fled British justice in 1993. As chairman of the Conservative Graduates' Association, Mr Hannan published a letter in 1995 which praised Turkish North Cyprus, a state Britain refuses to recognise, as \"enduring proof of people's natural wish to be governed by their own compatriots\". The letter, which set Mr Hannan directly at odds with official Tory policy, came as an embarrassment to the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, who this week met a delegation of Greek Cypriots - the island's formal government which is applying to join the EU. Mr Hannan, who has been drafted in to write election speeches for Mr Hague, launched a blistering attack on the Greeks in his letter. Describing the Greek Cypriot application for EU membership, which is supported by the Tories, as \"illegal\", Mr Hannan accused mainland Greece of \"viciously suppressing its own minorities\". Turkey, which has been widely criticised for suppressing the Kurds, is praised for standing up to Islamic fundamentalism and communism. Mr Hannan's letter was seized on last night by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook. \"Britain is strongly supportive of Cyprus's application to join the EU,\" Mr Cook said. \"If William Hague wishes to be considered a friend of Cyprus he should not be associated with those who hold extraordinary anti-Cypriot opinions.\" Stephen Twigg, the Labour MP for Enfield Southgate, which has the highest number of Greek Cypriots in Britain, called for Mr Hannan to be sacked. \"This letter is deeply offensive to Cyprus. If William Hague has any respect for Cyprus and for British Cypriots he will sack Daniel Hannan immediately.\" Mr Hannan is a controversial figure whose appointment to Mr Hague's election writing team demonstrates how the Tory leadership will move to the right during the election campaign. The 29-year-old MEP has come close to calling for Britain to abandon the EU altogether. His letter is likely to alarm Tory candidates in a series of marginal seats in London. It is estimated that Greek Cypriots can decide the outcome in six seats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
