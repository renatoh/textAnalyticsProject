Even when fully erect, it hangs down between his legs. It doesn't cause any problems during intercourse, but I have had several lovers and have never seen this before. He is in his 40s and has a good-size erection and is normal in every other way. Should I be worried? No - your boyfriend's penis sounds fine. There is quite a bit of natural variation in erection angles, although the general trend is for younger men to have more \"upstanding\" erections - the kind you could hang a bath towel on. By the time they reach 40, their penis is more likely to be at 90 degree (hand towel, at best) due to a gradual loss of elasticity in certain ligaments. As men age beyond middle years (now we're talking paper towel) their erection probably points towards the floor - but that doesn't mean that they can't use it wonderfully well. Although most people are aware that there are penile size differences, they tend to expect all male genitalia to be the same shape. However, there is a great deal of perfectly normal variation. The same can be said of females; there is wide variety in vulva shape, colour and size. Unfortunately, this is so poorly recognised that many women are seeking surgical procedures to \"correct\" genital features such as larger labia, that are quite normal. Frankly, I hesitate to use the word \"normal\" in this context at all, because when it comes to genitalia and most things to do with sexuality, there's barely any such thing. \u00b7 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist specialising in treating sexual disorders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
