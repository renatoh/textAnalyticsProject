Quizzed by the iguana-faced legend about her reputation, Naomi confessed: 'I'm not a saint, I'm a human being. I've made so many mistakes. There's not a handbook on being a model.' There's not? What a bizarre gap in the market. I have just taken a three-minute surf on Amazon and discovered handbooks on How To Read Egyptian Hieroglyphics, How To Make Beaded Creatures, How To Behave Well So Your Horse Will Too and How To Pass The Police Initial Recruitment Test. ('Smile, stand straight and keep quiet about the fraud conviction'?). So it's tragic that poor Ms Campbell should have been unable to find a simple little guide to her chosen career. It's hard not to feel sorry for the six-foot millionairess. But worry not, Naomi! We hacks recognise an opportunity when we see one; my handbook on being a model will be out by Christmas. You'll find it on the very top shelf at Waterstones - anybody who can't reach is automatically disqualified. For any models who can't wait that long, here are my key tips on this most challenging and hazardous of professions. The catwalk Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. And take the gum out of your mouth first or you might fall over. Fashion shoots The more expensive the designer brand, the more miserable, tired, bored and ill you must look in advertising shots. A big smile spells Dorothy Perkins. Music videos Now that Robert Palmer's dead, this work is thin on the ground. Thank God Aerosmith are still going. Diet (1) Naturally my Christmas book will contain a full appendix of useful recipes for aspiring models. With no space to reproduce the full chapter here, I give you simply 'Models' Roast Chicken'. Take one roast chicken and a packet of Marlboro Lights. Bin the chicken. Smoke the Marlboros. Diet (2) It is important to be seen to distinguish between different brands of mineral water. If you are offered a glass of Badoit, throw it in somebody's face and demand Perrier. If you are brought Perrier, smash the glass and call for San Pellegrino. Drink nothing. Smoke the Marlboros. Romance Be sure to date small, old, ugly Italian businessmen. Models love to compete over whose boyfriend is the smallest, oldest and ugliest - although it doesn't last long, as Slavica Ecclestone always wins. But beware of falling into the classic new models' trap of going to bed with someone so small, old and ugly that you assume he must be staggeringly wealthy - when he is in fact just a cobbler from Naples. Demand to see the yacht first. Photo opportunities When out on the town with your new beau, remember to crouch as you pass paparazzi or you won't both fit in the picture. Slavica Ecclestone always does this but she still gets her head cut off. This is a double tragedy, as she is beautiful but the general public have never seen her face. Just her impressive bust. And Bernie. Press coverage If you haven't been talked about for a while, sue somebody. It doesn't matter who. Just hie yourself to a witness box and cry there. Failing that, employ some domestic staff and treat them so badly that they sue you . Socialising Study the rules and language of polo so that when a member of the Kidd family offers you 'a chukka' you don't say 'Yes please!' and head for the bathroom. Nobody knows why models go to polo, but it started happening and now they can't stop. Like salmon going upstream to mate, it demands an inexplicable amount of time and trouble but somehow you won't get laid otherwise. On the plus side, you're bound to meet Stefanie Powers. Dressing You must refer to all items of clothing or jewellery as 'pieces'. If asked about your personal style, say that you prefer 'an eclectic mix of designer pieces and high street'. Or 'eclectic stuff I pick up in the market, combined with vintage pieces'. I have no idea what it means. But you don't have to wear it, you just have to say it. Film work You may be offered cameos in big-screen films. It is important to look bored and mumble your lines incoherently. Act properly and you might end up crossing over (as Cameron Diaz did) which is too much like hard work. The only reason to take these movie jobs is that you might meet a film producer who is even smaller, older and uglier than your Italian boyfriend.
