Tony Blair and eight cabinet ministers set out plans for reforming public services, spreading prosperity and making the country a \"more civilised place\". Mr Blair highlighted policy initiatives on drugs, unemployment and paternity leave. Acknowledging that Labour still needs to do more on law and order, Mr Blair promised to create a register of hard drug dealers. Based on an idea first set out by the Scottish MP Derek Brown, he said the courts would have powers to place on a register anyone leaving prison and liable to deal in drugs. The register, which would not be available to the public, would help police keep track of suspects. The idea will be included in a package of proposals to tackle crime which will be published during the next fortnight. The home secretary, Jack Straw, told the conference there would be new rights for crime victims. He said they would be kept informed of the progress of their case through the courts and provided with explanations about the key decisions affecting them. He also promised to punish more effectively the 100,000 hard-core of persistent offenders \"with sentences which both properly take account of their offending record and do more to reduce reoffending when they return to the community\". On the unemployed, Mr Blair promised changes on the New Deal programme. He said: \"In future any jobless claimant will not just be expected to take work but also if they lack skills to take up a state offer to pay to improve their skills. \"As a condition of benefit we will establish basic skills tests for newly unemployed adults. We will pay for them to read, write and do basic maths\". The programme, in part modelled on the successful employment action zones, would be part of a wider drive to help the 7m adults with inadequate basic reading skills. Mr Blair also promised that paternity leave would be paid by the state. Two weeks pay is the likely amount on offer and it could be set at the same level as maternity pay, which is \u00a360.70 a week. The proposal will be condemned as another regulatory burden by business, but employers will be relieved that Mr Blair has rejected proposals that mothers should be able to return to their former employment with a statutory right to part-time work. In a separate speech the employment minister Tessa Jowell held out the prospect of a big increase in the provision of child care, admitting that at present there is only one place for every seven children aged under eight. She also presaged a drive on pay equality, drawing on figures showing that between a quarter and half of the pay gap between men and women is caused by \"employers' discrimination against women\". In a development which will lift the spirits of northern activists, John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, revealed that he had won the backing of Mr Blair to publish a green paper after the election setting out plans for elected regional assemblies in England. Mr Blair has been convinced that the regions can act as economic power houses and also raise, overall, British productivity. At present the regional development agencies in England are monitored by non-statutory and unelected groups of councillors working in regional chambers. The green paper is likely to propose that referendums on elected assemblies should be triggered either by these chambers or by a petition from a fixed proportion of the electorate within each region. He drew loud cheers when he said: \"Regional chambers are a start to decentralisation in the English regions. Our next step must be to deepen regional accountability. \"I believe the time is right to take the next steps to publish a green paper on empowering our regions to strengthen the accountability of regional chambers, and where people vote for it to move to directly elected regional assemblies.\" The move was welcomed by many northern councillors who will be crucial in getting out the core Labour vote at the coming election. Throughout the weekend ministers went out of their way to promise greater freedom to local councillors. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, even held out the prospect of 150 councils being given greater freedom to spend money, so long as they negotiated with the Treasury on a common set of targets. Efforts were also made to appease pensioners, many of whom were infuriated by the 75p rise in the state pension last year. Mr Prescott promised to equalise the age for concessionary fares, saying it would help an extra 1m people at 60 years of age. The health secretary Alan Milburn also highlighted measures likely to please NHS workers. Besides offering extra cash and new targets to cut down health inequalities between poor and rich, he said it was time to \"shift the centre of gravity to the NHS frontline\". He promised ward sisters would control ward budgets so that they would have \"the power to stop payments to privately run cleaning firms which are failing to keep our hospitals clean\". He said that as services improved, so more devolution would take hold. The best hospitals would be free to use extra cash to pay bonuses to the best teams of staff. Poor services would get cash to improve them. It was a consistent theme of ministers that after two years of tight spending controls at the start of Labour's first term, the benefits of extra cash were starting to flow. Mr Blair told his audience that his government had matured in office and he was proud that there had been no breakdown in the relationship between the party and government that had disfigured previous Labour administrations. \u0095 Debate Labour's record with Polly Toynbee and David Walker at 2pm today at theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
