How did a word that used to have a single clear meaning come to imply very much the reverse? Officials who have been taken, possibly temporarily, out of the action, are said to have been \"recused\". As the chairman of the BBC Trust, himself a prominent Roman Catholic, will know better than most, the term \"recusant\" has always applied to people, most of them Roman Catholics, who refused to attend the Church of England when the law made that compulsory in 1593. Their consciences and beliefs required that they disobey. They were standing up for what they believed in; they were certainly not, like the BBC's recently recused, being stood down. Some of them were even executed for their recusancy. It has to be hoped that the disciplinary measures now being mooted in Broadcasting House will not go as far as that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
