The Scotland winger returned to action in February after spending 16 months sidelined by a career-threatening knee injury repaired by complex surgery which required two operations. It meant Snodgrass was not overly keen on being clattered by an anticipated penalty-area challenge from Palace\u2019s Scott Dann in the 3-3 draw at the KCom Stadium on Saturday. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had an injury like I\u2019ve had you\u2019re not going to go in and try and get in the way,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to get out of the way. I felt as if I needed to ride the tackle. I thought the defender was obviously going to come in and slide but he never slid, he never tackled.\u201d Snodgrass, who converted a penalty he readily agrees Mike Jones should never have awarded to give Hull a 1-0 lead, has been heavily criticised with Palace\u2019s manager, Alan Pardew, accusing him of simulation with Gary Lineker following suit on Match of the Day. The vast majority of his critics, though, will not have experienced such extensive surgery and lengthy rehabilitation. If the furore undoubtedly offered Pardew a welcome chance to divert attention from his still fragile job security at Selhurst Park, where he remains under intense scrutiny from Palace\u2019s American investors, Snodgrass acknowledges that the evidence against him looks compelling but is adamant he would not have risked a sending off. \u201cIt looks bad because the defender never tackled,\u201d said a player who, at the time, had just been booked for tugging Christian Benteke\u2019s shirt. \u201cBut I\u2019m not intentionally wanting to try and dive because I\u2019m on a booking. You can get sent off if you\u2019re trying to con them. But I\u2019ve never been that type of player, never. \u201cIt was never a penalty but that was the referee\u2019s decision. I never thought I might be sent off, I was just trying to get away from what I thought would be an obvious tackle. I\u2019ve always prided myself on being an honest player, that\u2019s what my game\u2019s all about. I\u2019ve never been one for diving. I\u2019m not that type of player, I was trying to get out of the way.\u201d Snodgrass has left himself open to accusations of blatant hypocrisy after he warned Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Fernando Forestieri last season not to ruin the Championship play-off final against Hull by diving. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to win at Wembley by cheating,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cDiving\u2019s terrible for the game. It\u2019s cheating the referee.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
