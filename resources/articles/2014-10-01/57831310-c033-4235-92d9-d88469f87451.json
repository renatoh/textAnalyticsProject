The announcement that cult TV series Twin Peaks will be revived as a nine-episode series in 2016 has seen sales of $300 tickets skyrocket as fans revel in the prospect of renewing acquaintance with FBI special agent Dale Cooper and his fondness for cherry pie and coffee. Tickets for the event \u2013 held every July in North Bend, Washington, where Twin Peaks was partly filmed \u2013 went on sale on 1 October, and last week\u2019s news has ensured that next summer\u2019s event will attract record numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted,\u201d festival organiser Rob Lindley told the Observer. \u201cWe\u2019d never given up hope the series would come back.\u201d He said the gathering, which typically draws around 200, makes up in perversity \u2013 including cherry stem-tying contests and a plastic-wrapped party \u2013 what it lacks in numbers. The storyline of the original series, which is set in a typical Pacific north-west lumber town, nominally sought to solve the murder of the town\u2019s homecoming queen, who is discovered wrapped in plastic by the river. With a backwards-talking dwarf \u2013 the Man from Another Place \u2013 and other oddities, the series was a natural successor to Lynch\u2019s film Blue Velvet and forerunner to The X-Files. Series co-creator, Mark Frost, explained last week that he and Lynch had felt \u201ca sense of responsibility\u201d to fans who\u2019d never given up hope. \u201cIt never insulted the viewer\u2019s intelligence \u2013 it always made you think,\u201d said Lindley. The original series, with its strange non-linear narrative of small-town America obscuring an underbelly of Satanic abuse, provided a memorable Sunday-night vehicle for philosophical rumination. Lindley said the show\u2019s enduring appeal might hinge on its refusal to answer its own underlying mysteries. \u201c[Lynch] had us wondering about things above the stars and below the earth. He talked about UFOs, the Black Lodge, the White Lodge, the spirits, owls, the humans and their emotions. He grabbed people from different angles.\u201d Anticipation that Lynch and Frost were planning a revival had been building, said Pieter Dom, founder of the Welcome to Twin Peaks fansite. He\u2019d heard rumours of the new series, but they\u2019d always been shot down. The return of Twin Peaks raises the question of whether it can recapture the weirdness of the original. \u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Dom said. \u201cThere must be a good reason or they wouldn\u2019t do it. They\u2019re going to blow our minds.\u201d Frost and Lynch face a quandary: answer the story\u2019s many questions and the series could lose its mystery; yet without mystery, there is no Twin Peaks. Critics warn that fans who think they want answers, really don\u2019t. Frost told the Los Angeles Times that Cooper\u2019s fate was \u201cnot going to be something that will seem ambiguous when you see it\u201d. Asked why the series continued to be so popular when there are so many dark, experimental stories on TV, he couldn\u2019t say. \u201cPeople seem to remember it even better than we do. It\u2019s kind of an important thing for a lot of people.\u201d However, Hollywood blogger Jeffrey Wells claimed that the original Twin Peaks was out of ideas by the time it was cancelled. To revive it, he said, \u201cLynch is basically admitting he\u2019s run out of ideas.\u201d One character unlikely to reappear is the terrifying, denim-clad killer Bob, played by set director Frank Silva. Frost said that despite \u201chaunting the dreams of millions of Americans\u201d Silva, who died in 1995, was \u201cthe nicest man you\u2019ll ever meet\u201d. It\u2019s that kind of counterpoint that made Twin Peaks so compelling, said Lindley. \u201cLynch was getting into what we perceive on the outside compared to the evil within. Small-town America and everything\u2019s perfect. But underneath there\u2019s another story; the prom queen is a whore and a cocaine addict. Twin Peaks let that be known.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
