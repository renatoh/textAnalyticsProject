It is four years since the Russian oligarch secured his takeover in west London, changing the face of the domestic game in the process, with Chelsea now determined to regain the Premier League title wrested from them by Manchester United last term. Their failure as yet to secure agreements with the trio of players, and the two influential Englishmen in particular, had been a cause of some consternation with Lampard and Terry seeking terms to match or better the \u00a3120,000-a-week contracts given to Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko last summer. Talks are continuing, if only sporadically, with Terry's agent, Aaron Lincoln, now in Los Angeles for the team's pre-season tour. \"I'm hopeful we will be able to sort all these out,\" said Buck. \"It's not something where there are negotiations every day. Things happen periodically, but we are not in a super great rush. Sure, we would like to get it done, but there's no deadline and there doesn't need to be. All three have two years left so I don't see there's a great rush, but I do think they should be done properly. \"As for Roman, he's just as enthusiastic as the first day he bought the club. I've seen him several times this summer and, obviously, he's very enthusiastic about Chelsea Football Club. I don't see the slightest reduction in his interest.\" That commitment could yet stretch to the Russian sanctioning further major signings, despite Jose Mourinho making only one cash addition this summer in Lyon's Florent Malouda for \u00a313.5m. \"Roman has never said the chequebook is closed. If the right player came along at the right price and we needed him then there's no reason why we wouldn't buy him,\" said Buck. \"It is a coincidence that the money has dropped off this summer. I don't think it was a policy decision. It's just that the type of players we needed were available and happened to be free transfers. \"If the right player came along and the transfer fee was a lot of money, but he was value for money, then we would give it serious consideration. But the strategy is to reduce transfer payments and to reduce the amount of money we spend every summer and every January. I don't call that restraint, I call that a policy. The policy going forward, whether that's for five or 10 years, is to spend less and less money on transfers. We would spend appropriate amounts of money on players.\" Yet, if this is a club reinvigorated for the new season, the sense of optimism is chiefly born of the apparent reconciliation in Mourinho's relationship with Abramovich. The pair met earlier this month for talks aimed at repairing their fractured partnership, with the Portuguese now reassured that the appointment of Avram Grant as director of football will not serve to undermine him. \"We had the meeting a couple of weeks ago and it was a good meeting,\" said Buck. \"The board and Jose are not going to agree on everything every day. Everyone has their own opinions. It's a matter of listening to other opinions and coming together collectively to figure out how to take the club forward. \"We are in a position where all parties recognise the strengths of the others. I'm glad it's all resolved. Jose is very happy with his relationship with Roman at the moment. We have Frank Arnesen looking at scouting and youth development, Jose looking at the first team and the success of the first team, and Avram is sort of trying to coordinate strategy for the next five or 10 years. I don't think he is a threat, and I don't think Jose thinks he is. That's what's important. \"We felt something was missing in the management in terms of the coordination of the whole football programme, not just the first team or working the academy or scouting system, but trying to bring it all together. We are trying to build for the long term, not just for this year. We aren't trying to develop a dynasty as such but we are trying to develop something long term, and that's where Avram can help us. Roman is in charge. In terms of transfers, it's a collective decision as it always has been. The manager, Frank Arnesen and Avram make the decisions and the board is responsible for the deals. \"With the first team it starts with the manager in terms of what his needs are next season. In terms of the academy, Frank is now in charge of that. We needed a structure to pull it all together and that's where Avram fits in.\" Asked whether Grant could overrule a transfer, Buck added: \"No that's not the case. It's Jose's call but he gets input from a variety of people. That's what you would expect. Jose wants us to be a little more exciting and to use our wingers. As a fan, which is what I am, I would like to see a little bit more of that. In the first instance we want to win and then, when you win a few times, you want to win with style. That's where we are in the development of Chelsea Football Club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
