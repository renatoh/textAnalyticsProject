Price \u00a35.99. Age 11+ yrs In June 1911 (so this story goes), Anastasia Romanov, youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, is given a diary for her 10th birthday; a diary in which she records the daily events of her life. Hers is not an ordinary life, but her preoccupations are those of pre-teenagers everywhere - sibling rivalry, clothes, schoolwork. Through the glass of Anastasia's naive optimism we see the onset of war in Russia and the scurrilous rumours surrounding the enigmatic figure of \"our friend\" Rasputin. Gradually and guardedly, Anastasia is exposed to the news of unrest sweeping Russia, though the gloss of filial devotion doesn't permit much insight into the people's disaffection with their tsar. For much of the diary, the narrative voice remains that of the 10-year-old girl, cheerfully good-humoured even when her family is eventually imprisoned in its palace. Only when her family is sent to Siberia does the tone change and a degree of greater understanding prevail, as matters rush headlong to their abrupt and brutal conclusion. A brief afterword outlines events on the morning of July 17 1918; readers engrossed by Anastasia's fascinating story will be left eager to find out more.
