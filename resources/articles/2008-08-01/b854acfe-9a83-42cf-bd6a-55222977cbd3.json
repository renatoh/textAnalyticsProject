A former pirate called Martin Frobisher claimed to have found the precious metal in the black rocks of Baffin Island, and Good Queen Bess was so excited at the chance to swell the nation's coffers that she sent him on not one but two expeditions. The rock turned out to be worthless, of course, but not before fortunes had been lost and reputations destroyed. The Encyclopaedia Britannica today notes that Frobisher \"lacked the capacity for patient factual investigation\", which seems to be putting it charitably. Paul B Davies's play Gold's Fool (2.15pm, Radio 4) follows his translatlantic blunderings. Laurie Taylor, meanwhile, is probing our love-hate relationship with the suburbs. The people who live in the 'burbs are some of the happiest in the land - so why does popular culture show such scorn for them? Helping out in Thinking Allowed (4pm, Radio 4) are writer Iain Sinclair and cultural theorist Tim Hubble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
