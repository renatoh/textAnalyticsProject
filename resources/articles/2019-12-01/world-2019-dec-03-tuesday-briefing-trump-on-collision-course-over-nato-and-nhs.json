Conservatives will be hoping he keeps quiet and doesn\u2019t try to \u201chelp\u201d their electoral fortunes. Read on for the latest election news, and the best of the rest \u2013 and don\u2019t forget to follow our live politics coverage as the day progresses. What\u2019s going on? Donald Trump\u2019s presence in London today for Nato meetings is causing jitters in the Conservative camp, as the Tories worry about the US president\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to say things without necessarily thinking through the consequences. Trump is being seen as a potential liability for Boris Johnson in the campaign, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons. Rowena Mason writes that Johnson will seek to play down his relationship with the president in light of those accusations. Johnson has made clear he would not welcome any input from Trump at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered his endorsement over the summer. But Trump has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. The Tories will be hopeful he says little or nothing to inflame voter fears. Trump will be among Nato leaders attending a banquet with the Queen tonight at Buckingham Palace. NHS nurses and doctors will lead a \u201cHands off our NHS\u201d protest starting at Trafalgar Square then heading down the Mall to arrive at Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Also protesting outside Buckingham Palace will be the family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was killed in a motorbike crash in Northamptonshire in August. Anne Sacoolas, the 42-year-old motorist allegedly responsible, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US. Meanwhile the Conservatives face ongoing accusations of politicising a tragedy in their response to the London Bridge terror attack. One of Johnson\u2019s ministers has been accused of using the \u201cTrump playbook\u201d and Dave Merritt, father of victim Jack Merritt, has written a powerful piece in the Guardian saying his son \u201cwould be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against\u201d.

Jeremy Corbyn has been spotted in a bespoke campaign suit with \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d stitched into its red pinstripes. \u201cWhat British democracy needs right now is the advice of a cartoonist who doesn\u2019t even live in your wretched country,\u201d writes Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon.

Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.\u201d Maxwell replied: \u201cHave some info. Call me when you have a moment.\u201d The prince, 59, has stood down from public duties over his relationship with Epstein but has consistently and categorically denied the sex allegations.
