If robots are making our call centre jobs redundant, then at least let us have our Sunday jam sessions. But music, like anything else, has to move on: \u201cIn a world of personalisation and on-demand services, music is one of very few remaining static artefacts,\u201d says Ken Lythgoe, head of business development at creative AI technology company MXX. The company has created what it says is the world\u2019s first AI tech that allows individual users to instantly edit music to fit their own video footage, complete with rises and fades. AI doesn\u2019t need to be the enemy of music, says Lythgoe: \u201cThere are two types of AI \u2013 the AI that is here to replace us and AI that is here to empower us \u2013 we are definitely in the empowerment camp. We are not about computers replacing musicians or editors; we are firm believers in the creative process.\u201d \u201cBusinesses and individuals want to alter their experience with music, depending on their needs,\u201d says Lythgoe. \u201cThey want a world where music can be adapted to perfectly fit certain experiences \u2013 such as gym workouts and runs, gaming, user-generated content and virtual or augmented-reality experiences.\u201d MXX was founded in 2015 by AI specialist and composer Joe Lyske and Philip Walsh, former financial services CEO and founder of investment vehicle and AI incubator, Time Machine Capital. Lyske\u2019s research included devising a tool that generated film scores that fooled 50% of professional film composers into thinking they were listening to a fellow professional. MXX\u2019s tech listens to music and creates metadata of its understanding of it. This data includes where it can edit in and out of sections, as well as what the sections might mean to a human, such as \u201cbuilding tension\u201d, \u201cclimax\u201d, \u201cchorus\u201d and \u201cverse\u201d. When the user provides the brief for the music they want, the AI can edit the original track to fit the brief. Lythgoe explains: \u201cJust as a silent film pianist would adapt the music to the mood of the audience or speed of the projector, we can have our favourite music adapt to our car journey time, the pace of our run or gym workout or the way the cat falls off the sofa in our social media post.\u201d The technology\u2019s target users are advertising agencies, game creators, production companies, music supervisors, labels and sync agencies, a market that, says Lythgoe, is crying out for tech like this: \u201cThere are 400,000 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every 60 seconds alone. There aren\u2019t enough music editing professionals in the world to cope with that kind of content.\u201d AI-generated music does not take jobs, says Lythgoe: \u201cIn fact editors say the opposite. They often have to edit dozens of versions of different music to adverts for free, only being able to charge for the final version. This tech allows them to set up a template to sell to their customers, that the customer can play with all day till they have found the track they are looking for.\u201d Valerio Velardo is co-founder and CEO of Berlin-based Melodrive, which is using AI to automatically generate soundtracks for virtual reality and video games in real time. A classically trained musician, he has a PhD in music and AI, and a degree in astrophysics. Melodrive (which has five staff) essentially composes an infinite stream of original, \u201cemotionally variable\u201d music in real time. Velardo explains: \u201cIn a video game, if a player encounters more than 10 enemies, the music can move from being \u2018almost angry\u2019 to \u2018completely crazy\u2019.\u201d Far from putting musicians and composers out of business, Velardo says tech like Melodrive is \u201cmore of a sparring partner. We are just building tools to be more creative with and this is no different from the evolution of the piano from the harpsichord, to things like [digital audio workstation] Cubase.\u201d The UK\u2019s AI sector could be worth \u00a3232bn to the UK economy by 2030, according to a report (pdf) from PwC, and back in 2018 the government announced a \u00a31bn deal to put the UK at the forefront of the AI industry. UK Music\u2019s Measuring Music 2018 report puts the UK music industry\u2019s gross value added (GVA) at \u00a34.5bn. \u201cAI and music is certainly a growth area and likely to continue to be so,\u201d says Craig Hamilton, research fellow at the Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural Research: \u201cA number of startups have attracted investment over the last couple of years \u2013 such as Amper and AI Music \u2013 and there is also a lot of activity within many of the larger tech and entertainment firms, notably Sony, Google, Spotify, IBM and Facebook. This should not be surprising \u2013 AI systems rely on large amounts of data to build and train models and on powerful computational, connected systems to process data and deploy the results.\u201d Since the turn of the century, music consumption has increasingly shifted to systems capable of generating and analysing data on both user activity and musical works, says Hamilton, \u201cand there has also been an exponential growth in the scale and power of computational processing systems.\u201d In that sense, he adds: \u201cAI and music together does have a certain air of inevitability.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
