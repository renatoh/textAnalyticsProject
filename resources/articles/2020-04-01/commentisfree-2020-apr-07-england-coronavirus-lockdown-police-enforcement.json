Heavy-handed police enforcement isn't", "bodyText": "In the first few weeks of law school in 1989 I learned something about English law that has been a source of comfort, pride and security ever since. In England, you can do anything that is not specifically prohibited by law. I remember leaving that lecture with a newfound sense of my own freedom as a British citizen. As I walked along the pavement, I carried with me the knowledge that the police could not stop me for no reason and demand to know what I was doing, why I was doing it or where I was going. It seems obvious, when you see it in black and white, but I suspect most of us take for granted this simple principle, which underpins our basic rights in what I believe to be the country with more real personal liberty than any other. But in a matter of days parliament legislated away fundamental human rights that were hard won over centuries \u2013 freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, rights to family life, even the right to refuse consent to medical treatment when of sound mind. The motivation is surely sound: the need to practise social distancing to ensure that we control the coronavirus pandemic and save as many lives as possible. But I strongly disagree with the means of achieving it. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 came into force at 1pm on 26 March, with minimal parliamentary debate and scrutiny. It is important to understand what the regulations actually say, rather than what the prime minister and the government have been telling us. \u201cNo person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d is the most important and central provision. Contrary to some of the myths around, there is no definition of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be found anywhere. The regulations merely give some examples of excursions that are presumed to be reasonable, including \u201cto obtain basic necessities\u201d, \u201cto take exercise\u201d, \u201cto seek medical assistance\u201d, \u201cto provide care or assistance\u201d and various other activities. Importantly, there is no legal limit on the number of times a day that even these activities can be undertaken, no matter how many references are made to the \u201conce a day rule\u201d for exercise, shopping or anything else. The police have no power to stop you and demand an explanation as to why you are away from your home, although common sense would dictate a courteous and cooperative response if asked such questions by an officer. Still less can officers insist on searching your shopping bags to decide whether any given item is a basic necessity or not (another undefined term but which specifically includes food and medical supplies). There is no power to mount roadblocks or to stop vehicles at will, as has been made crystal clear in guidance issued in recent days by the National Police Chiefs Council, which coordinates policing procedures across the country. The NPCC has helpfully stressed the need for \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d, now as much as ever, but stories of overzealous officers unlawfully demanding explanations from the public have multiplied day by day. I was against the use of the police to enforce social distancing from the outset. Not only did I object to the ripping up of basic freedoms, with no proper thought, but I had real concerns that the bond of trust between the public and the police service would come under intolerable strain. Sadly, everything I have seen since has increased my concern. For the first time I can remember, last week I saw no fewer than three police cars on the high street of the small town where I live. Officers were standing by the road, eyeing vehicles and pedestrians alike with suspicion. Had the government\u2019s communications strategy been more coherent from the start, including with the use of frontline medical personnel to explain the need for social distancing, I do not believe that so many people would have ignored the guidance in the early days. Frontline NHS staff have done an inspirational job, some even paying with their lives, and I believe that their voices should have been at the fore in all press conferences. Even though a small minority have persisted in gathering in groups, I still do not accept the need to legislate for a nationwide house arrest using the police for enforcement. \u2022 Chris Daw QC is a barrister.
