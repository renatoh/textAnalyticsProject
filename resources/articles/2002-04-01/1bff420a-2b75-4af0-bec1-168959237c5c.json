The club have abandoned their share listing in order to force through a \u00a35m rescue deal being proposed by major shareholder Nigel Doughty. The City businessman has offered to stump up the cash but only if his stake is increased from 40% to 85%, he is appointed chairman and he gets to choose who the other directors are. The club believe accepting the deal is their best chance of putting behind the financial troubles it endured since being relegated from the Premiership in 1999. The club was forced to end their share listing when City advisers HSBC failed to approve the deal. Regulations stipulate that directors can only recommend that the deal is \"fair and reasonable\" to all shareholders in the club if HSBC endorses the opinion. Without the bank's approval the stock exchange would not permit the deal to go ahead so the club had little choice but to give up their plc status. A spokesman for HSBC, one of the world's biggest banks, declined to say why it had not publicly backed the deal. A spokesman for Nottingham Forest was unable to explain why HSBC had appeared reluctant to endorse the arrangement. Shareholders in Forest get the chance to vote on the deal at a meeting on April 29. Fans bought into the club when it was floated in 1997 at 70p a share. The shares were suspended at 12p in December after the club failed to meet the deadline for reporting its annual results and have not been traded since. Several football clubs have seen shares drop sharply since raising cash through the City but Forest is the first to leave the square mile. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
