Researchers from the University of London\u2019s school of medicine and dentistry were so alarmed by their initial findings that they wrote an editorial in the British Medical Journal to warn of the dangers of buying breast milk online before their study was completed. The editorial says breast milk sold online should be screened for diseases such as hepatitis, HIV and syphilis. Lead author Dr Sarah Steele said she feared that babies would die from unscreened milk sold online if the market was not regulated. In one of the studies she cited, more than 90% of breast milk purchased online was found to have bacterial growth. Some of the sellers interviewed included intravenous drug users. Unregulated websites selling breast milk attract tens of thousand of users in the US, the research found. One site reported growing by 800 users each month. It also reported an emerging market in the UK on specialist sites as well as general retail sites including Gumtree and Craigslist. Premium prices of up $4 (\u00a32.70) per fluid ounce (30ml) are offered by mothers who purport to eat only organic or vegan food, or can boast having \u201cfat, chubby babies\u201d, the researchers found. The online market caters primarily for mothers who are unable to breastfeed their babies, serving as a cheaper alternative to regulated milk banks, where the milk is always pasteurised. But consumers also include cancer patients who believe breast milk has health benefits and gym enthusiasts who believe breast milk is a natural superfood. A third group of adult consumers are fetishists \u201cwho like to be fed like a baby, either from source or from a bottle\u201d, according to Steele. She told the Guardian: \u201cI reserve my judgment on these things. The focus for us is that people need to be making safer feeding choices. In the adult market there are cancer patients who are desperate to try anything and a lot of people in the body-building and cross-fit communities who really don\u2019t realise the dangers. They think it\u2019s a natural superfood. They don\u2019t realise that it could be contaminated with bacteria.\u201d Steele explained the dangers: \u201cWhen sellers freeze milk and send it in the mail it thaws out. That\u2019s when bacteria has time to grow and and become really dangerous, especially for infants.\u201d She added: \u201cWe started this study from a curiosity point of view initially, but the public health data is so definitive on how dangerous it is that we couldn\u2019t wait for the end of our project because that could have taken several years to complete. It was so damning that we felt we had to approach the BMJ and say: \u2018This needs to get out there now.\u2019 We don\u2019t want to be writing the report after there has been an infant death in Britain.\u201d The editorial calls for healthcare workers to be trained to offer advice about how to acquire breast milk safely. Steele said: \u201cWe observed that mothers are often in a desperate state and are nervous about talking to healthcare professional about their difficulties feeding. The big danger is that more women turn online and that threatens the health of their infants. And with the adult market growing, we want to make sure people aren\u2019t spreading communicable diseases in new ways, just as we are getting on top of things like hepatitis, syphilis and HIV.\u201d Steele said the health benefits for adults of drinking breast milk were unproven. \u201cHuman breast milk doesn\u2019t really have that many advantages for adults,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is certainly not what you need in the context of bodybuilding and cross-fit, as a post-workout recovery drink.\u201d She pointed out that consuming breast milk was regularly discussed on mainstream online bodybuilding forums. The paper concludes: \u201cAlthough breast milk holds many known benefits, seeking out another\u2019s milk rather than turning to instant formula poses risks. When breast milk is screened and treated appropriately, as the World Health Organisation states, it remains second to a mother\u2019s own milk as best for infant feeding. At present, milk bought online is a far from ideal alternative, exposing infants and other consumers to microbiological and chemical agents. Urgent action is required to make this market safer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
