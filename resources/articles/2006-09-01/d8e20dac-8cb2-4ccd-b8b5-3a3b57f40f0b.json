The Spaniard has admitted that relations with his opposite number have become strained in the past 12 months, a legacy of Liverpool's defeat of the Londoners in the Champions League semi-final two seasons ago and their fiercely competitive meetings in the group stage of last year's competition. Yet Ben\u00edtez has grown exasperated that games between the teams have since been overshadowed by the intrigue surrounding the undignified childish spat. That prompted the Liverpool manager to pave the way for reconciliation yesterday, though he shifted the onus firmly on to Mourinho. \"We'll go down there and be his guests on Sunday,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"At the end of the game I will wait and see if he offers his hand. If he does, then I'll shake it. Not a problem. Normally, when a manager comes to Anfield and comes to see me, I'll welcome him and offer him all the best for the season. \"The problem's been that, in the build-up to these games, people are always talking about things that have nothing to do with football. Because we talk about this all the time ahead of these matches, I think it's now time to stop speaking about it. If he wants to shake hands, I don't have any problems with that. I will shake his hand. I prefer to talk about football than these small things.\" Dealings between the pair sank to a new low after the managers failed to acknowledge each other after Liverpool's victory in the FA Cup semi-final in April, a mood maintained at last month's Community Shield in Cardiff. Mourinho insisted after the 2-1 defeat that Ben\u00edtez had had the opportunity to approach him at the final whistle. \"I was on the pitch from the last whistle until the moment Liverpool received the cup,\" said the Chelsea manager at the time. \"You'll have to ask him [why he didn't come over to me].\" Yet Ben\u00edtez is understood to have been unimpressed with the Portuguese's demeanour before kick-off, when the pair found themselves standing next to each other in the bowels of the stadium and took it as an indication that Mourinho was not interested in healing a relationship which had initially been warm. But, with the 12th meeting since the managers took over at their respective clubs in the summer of 2004 looming, the Spaniard would now rather bury the hatchet. \"I don't want to keep talking about it,\" added Ben\u00edtez. \"I think that, originally, we were fine. After the Champions League game when we drew here [last year], we started having some problems. I've never spoken about his team, about how they play, so for me it's time to finish with this situation. We should be talking about things on the pitch, not matters off it.\" Liverpool go to Stamford Bridge, where Mourinho has not lost a league game and the Merseysiders have won only once since 1989, attempting to revive a Premiership challenge with some defensive solidity restored by Tuesday's 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven. That was Jos\u00e9 Reina's first clean sheet of the season after 29 last term. Reina was sent off for raising his arms at Chelsea's Arjen Robben last season, with Ben\u00edtez's mood hardly improved by the Dutchman's perceived theatrics following the incident. \"There is no revenge in mind,\" the goalkeeper said. \"It's just a game, but we have to be ready. We need to do much better in the big matches. When you get points against the big teams it means that they have less. Whoever makes the least mistakes will win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
