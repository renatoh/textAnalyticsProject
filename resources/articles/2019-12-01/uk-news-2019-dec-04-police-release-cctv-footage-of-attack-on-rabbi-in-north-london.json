They have also challenged concerns in the Jewish community about the speed of the police response to the incident last week, which left the rabbi bruised and traumatised. The images from Stamford Hill overground station show two young men in black hooded jackets, one wearing dark jeans and light trainers and carrying a rucksack, and the other with light torn jeans and black trainers. The Metropolitan police are also keen to trace a woman who intervened to stop the attack last Friday night in Amhurst Park. Shomrim, a Jewish neighbourhood watch group that reported the incident, said the unnamed rabbi was on a visit from Israel for a family wedding when he was attacked. The police have since verified Shomrim\u2019s account by talking to the 54-year-old victim after he returned home to Israel and then travelled on to the US. He has provided a full account of the assault and the antisemitic verbal abuse to which he was subjected. Police are also speaking to witnesses and are gathering CCTV from the area. According to Shomrim, the two attackers shouted \u201cfucking Jew, dirty Jew\u201d before striking the rabbi to the ground. Shomrim\u2019s chairman, Rabbi Herschel Gluck, had accused police of dragging their feet over the incident. \u201cWhen something like this happens, which has caused deep distress to the Jewish community, the police should pull out all the stops to deal with it in a suitable manner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hear a lot of very nice talk about being against hate crime and antisemitism but when it comes down to it we don\u2019t see any appropriate action.\u201d Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have both condemned the attack. Gluck said Corbyn was the only party leader to have personally called him to express his shock and empathy with the Jewish community. DS Adam Ghaboos, who is leading the investigation, insisted the Met has been committed to thoroughly investigating the assault since it was reported. He also told the Guardian he had since spoken to Rabbi Gluck to allay his concerns about response of the police, which he said was initially hampered by difficulty in tracking down the victim. He said the police were first alerted in a 999 call on Friday, which referred only to an assault on a \u201cJewish man in the street\u201d. Police were told the name of the victim on Saturday evening by Shomrim, before he flew to Israel on Sunday morning. They did not his get victim\u2019s statement until Wednesday. DS Ghaboos said: \u201cNot being able to get hold of the victim did not mean that the investigation was paused.\u201d Gluck contrasted the police response to Friday\u2019s incident with the speed in which police arrested a man following a widely shared video last month that showed a Jewish family being subjected to antisemitic abuse on the London Underground. Ghaboos said: \u201cThere is no variance in the urgency with which we treat a hate crime. It is an immediate proportionate response to what is a horrendous crime. It gets the full response every time.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a meeting with Rabbi Gluck to increase the working between Shomrim and the police locally, to help with the concerns in the Jewish community. \u201cI went through the timings of when the incident happened: how it was reported to us both over the 999 system and then by Shomrim and the reaction by the police.\u201d A Met spokeswoman added: \u201cWe welcome the concern from the community because it was a shocking incident.\u201d In a statement, Ghaboos added: \u201cI want to reassure the community that we take offences of this nature extremely serious and are doing what we can to progress this investigation. \u201cWhile we carry out a number of inquiries, we are asking for the public\u2019s assistance in identifying two males we would like to speak to in connection with this incident. He said anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has further information on the identity of the suspect should call 07500 850625 quoting CAD 6332/30Nov."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
