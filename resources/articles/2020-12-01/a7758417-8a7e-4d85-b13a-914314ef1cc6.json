The billionaire confirmed the move in an interview with Matt Murray, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editor in chief. \u201cThe two biggest things that I got going on right now are the Starship development in south Texas \u2026 and then the big new US factory for Tesla,\u201d the 49-year-old CEO said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a great use of my time here [in California].\u201d Speaking at a Wall Street Journal summit, Musk also had some sharp words for his former home state. \u201cIf a team is winning for too long, they tend to get complacent,\u201d Musk said, according to the Verge. \u201cCalifornia has been winning for a long time, and I think they\u2019re taking it for granted.\u201d Texas might potentially offer some tax reprieve for the world\u2019s second richest man. It does not collect personal income tax, while California has some of the highest state tax rates in the United States. A 670% rally in Tesla shares this year has boosted Musk\u2019s net worth from $27bn to $155bn, just behind Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In a conversation touching a wide range of topics including government intervention, technology companies and corporate policy, Musk criticized CEOs of other US companies for not focusing enough on their products. \u201cIf you find yourself spending a lot of time giving presentations and reviewing spreadsheets, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree,\u201d Musk said. On Tesla\u2019s move to raise $5bn in capital, he said: \u201cWe thought we can retire a lot of the debt and increase the security of the company \u2026 have more of a war chest.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
