Niasse became the third most expensive transfer in Everton\u2019s history, behind \u00a328m Romelu Lukaku and \u00a315m Marouane Fellaini, when he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract on deadline day. The 25-year-old was scouted by Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Aston Villa while scoring 13 goals in 23 games for Lokomotiv this season, also providing 10 assists, but Everton made the first significant bid for Russia\u2019s Premier League player of the year for 2015. Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco had offers rejected for the 44-times capped Senegal striker, who wanted a move to the Premier League because his wife is based in Manchester. The forward, who could be eligible to make his Everton debut at Stoke City on Saturday, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for me, a big dream to play in the Premier League and a big dream to play for Everton. I know Everton is one of the big clubs here in England with history, the fans and the great players, so I\u2019m very excited and happy to be here. \u201cI started to watch Everton more since the beginning of October because I had heard about their interest. I was interested to see how they play and how they have good young players. If you see players who are aged 20 or 21 and see them perform like that, you know you have a good coach. The manager has said exactly what he wants. He believes I can be a player who can add something to the team. It was not difficult to talk and understand one another. You can see also that he is a good person and I am really looking forward to playing for my new team.\u201d Everton\u2019s outlay on another striker will inevitably raise questions about Lukaku\u2019s future, with the club\u2019s leading goalscorer expected to be targeted by several European clubs this summer, but Mart\u00ednez claims Niasse represents a different option to the strikers at his disposal. The Everton manager said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted because Oumar is a player we have been following for a long time. He is the right personality and someone who is in a very good moment of his career. He has had a lot of success in Russia and he brings a different quality to what we already have in our squad. He\u2019s got a really good physicality \u2013 he is very strong and powerful. \u201cIt\u2019s not just scoring goals, he penetrates teams and opens up teams in the final third, which allows others to benefit from his work as well. He is a strong, powerful striker who can play in different positions. \u201cHe is going to be a terrific, fresh addition to a squad that will welcome his ability.\u201d Niasse has not played a competitive fixture since 10 December due to the break in the Russian league season and Mart\u00ednez said: \u201cHe\u2019ll need a little bit of time to understand the Premier League, with the tempo and all the new aspects of the league. But I wouldn\u2019t expect too long because he is the type of player who can have an impact in any game.\u201d Aiden McGeady and Conor McAleny left Everton on loan, joining Sheffield Wednesday and Wigan Athletic respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
