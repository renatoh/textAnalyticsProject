Analysts cut their profit forecasts by up to a third after the group blamed the downturn in consumer spending for its poor trading. The shares dropped 8% to 245p valuing the group at about \u00a3230m, well below the \u00a3470m it was worth just over a year ago. The chain - which has become famous for its Fcuk marketing campaign - admitted it was now estimating its profits for the year ending January 31 2006 would be \u00a320m to \u00a325m. Analysts had expected about \u00a333m. This is the third time City analysts have scaled back their forecasts in eight months. In November the group warned that profits would be \"significantly\" lower than expected while at the time of its full-year results in March the chain admitted that sales were down 17%. Stephen Marks, the chairman and holder of 42% of the group's shares, said: \"The CBI announced that the high street had witnessed the sharpest fall in sales volume in more than 22 years. French Connection is not immune to this. We are encouraged by our strong collections, but the high street is very tough at the moment.\" But analysts felt that the malaise on the high street was not the only reason for the downturn in French Connection's fortunes. Analysts at Numis Securities pointed out French Connection could not compete with Zara, H&amp;M or Top Shop on price and could not justify charging more like retailers such as Ted Baker. \"The one saving grace from a share price point of view is that today's news is likely to reignite speculation that either Stephen Marks might decide to take the business private or Baugur [the Icelandic retailer] might choose to add it to its stable of fashion brands,\" Numis analysts said. Baugur already holds about 3% of French Connection and has a large stake in Mosaic, the group that owns Oasis, Coast, Karen Miller and Whistles. In a conference call with City analysts Mr Marks, who refused to talk to the media yesterday, played down any suggestion that he would try to take control of the company he founded in 1972. He owned a majority stake in the business until a year ago when he sold off 10% of his shares - then worth \u00a340m - to fund a divorce from his wife Alisa. Mr Marks previously had a relationship with the designer Nicole Farhi, with whom he founded the group, and her stores are still part of the French Connection empire. The group is now expecting sales in the first half of this financial year to be down 11% in its UK and European arm. While it expects an improvement in the second half it is budgeting for \"only a small like-for-like increase in sales\". Meanwhile wholesalers, such as department stores that stock French Connection clothes, have not been reordering from the summer ranges. This has had a \"significant\" impact on sales in the first half of the financial year so far. The group also admitted this was behind its reduced expectations for its winter 2005 ranges. It now now expects a 10% fall in winter sales compared with last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
