After torturously crossing the Pyrenees on foot, led by a guide, he and his party faced an impasse: the Spanish authorities declared that they had entered the country illegally, though others had made the trip successfully. Spanish immigration law had been changed that very day, though it was rescinded two weeks later. The group was placed under house arrest at a hotel where, unwell and disheartened, Benjamin took the morphine pills that he carried in case of capture by the Nazis. He was also carrying a visa to the United States organised by his friend, the Frankfurt school philosopher Max Horkheimer, who had already made it across the Atlantic. The following day, others in his party, Jews like him, were released and made it safely out of Europe. Another friend, the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who transited through the same town, Portbou, a few months later en route to the US, wrote, \u201cOne day earlier Benjamin would have got through without any trouble; one day later the people in Marseille would have known that for the time being it was impossible to pass through Spain. Only on that particular day was the catastrophe possible.\u201d Benjamin\u2019s guide, Lisa Fittko, and an Austrian guide named Carina Birman, whose group Benjamin\u2019s joined up with on the last leg of the mountain trail, were what we today would call people smugglers. There were many of them operating across Europe, appalled by the plight of the Jews and other categories of \u201cUntermenschen\u201d, co-ordinating activities, forging documents and helping people cross borders illegally. They called them smugglers then too, and some accepted \u2013 even asked for \u2013payment to help those fleeing occupied Europe for Spain and neutral Switzerland. An armada of civilian craft smuggled Danish Jews out to neutral Sweden and Denmark ended the war with the lowest percentage of Jews lost to the Holocaust. Unlike today, when the word is used as a pejorative without nuance, those smugglers were seen as heroes. Many are named among the 24,811 Righteous from 47 countries \u2013 all those, rich and poor, Christian, Muslim and atheist, rural and urban, who helped Jews escape the Nazi regime \u2013 at the Israeli Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem. The implications of the term \u201csmuggler\u201d have taken a 180 degree turn in the 21st century. The neutrality of the word has been superceded by the simple addition of \u201cpeople\u201d as a prefix. \u201cPeople smuggler\u201d echoes \u201cslave trafficker\u201d and \u201csex trafficker\u201d, though the latter \u2013 a far bigger, more morally urgent problem because they are hidden in the dark economy \u2013 are not on our political to-do list. The term \u201csmuggler\u201d has been reframed in the ubiquitous economic language of neoliberalism, too. Australia\u2019s draconian laws against desperate people who arrive by boat are intended to break the \u201ceconomic model\u201d of the people smugglers. Our sanctions are not economic, however: the ADF are deployed to break the model physically. Other words are twisted. The words \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201casylum seeker\u201d were replaced last year by \u201cmigrant\u201d as the refugee crisis ramped up in Europe: not only by politicians but by the media too. \u201cMigrant\u201d disposes of the obligations implied by \u201casylum seeker\u201d \u2013 morally and psychologically, as well as under international law \u2013 and presumes an economic motive, even before individuals\u2019 claims to refugee status are assessed. People are quick to invoke Godwin\u2019s law, but it might be useful to meditate further on the Nazi occupation of Europe and its aftermath. Every European country that wasn\u2019t part of Axis, plus all the soldiers called in from their far-flung empires, and eventually the military might of the United States, threw blood and treasure into the fight to defeat Hitler. The loss of military and civilian life was inconceivable. But the democracies prevailed. That was \u201cus\u201d and this is \u201cthem\u201d. After the Rwandan and the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, the 2005 Responsibility to Protect (R2P) against genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity was written, an international commitment endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. It has proved ineffectual. It was invoked when NATO acted against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011, with a massive bombing campaign that left the country in ruins and civil war raging. It has not been invoked in Syria, where life has become such an ongoing nightmare that many hundreds of thousands are fleeing. And so it goes. Whatever the humanitarian rationale, R2P is clearly subordinate to strategic interests in \u201cthe arc of instability\u201d, as historian Ian Morris calls it, stretching from central Africa to Central Asia. The clarity of realism as a way of thinking about international relations is preferable to the weasel words of liberal interventionism. The comparison between the aftermath of WW2 and now is instructive. By the end of the second world war, there were five million displaced Russians, 12 million ethnic Germans expelled from countries of their birth in the patchwork that was Eastern Europe, and very many more. Estimates range from 11 million to 20 million. The Allied forces took them into care, pressing all kinds of military and civilian accommodation into service. The fledgling United Nations soon took over administration and went into overdrive to resettle the refugees, despite popular resistance from many accepting countries. By 1952, most them were settled. Australia cherry-picked the dispossessed, choosing them for what they could contribute to the country: health, vigour, and northern European looks. Klaus Neumann\u2019s essential book, Across the Seas: Australia\u2019s Response to Refugees: A History, enumerates criteria that now seem outrageous. My paternal family was among the lucky ones that ended up in Australia in 1948. My father, still a teenager when the war ended, remembers with lingering awe the kindness of Australians he encountered. After time in a displaced persons\u2019 camp in Italy, then at Bonegilla in Victoria, he was given a logging job in the tiny town of Millicent, in South Australia. He told the story of it many times when I was a kid. The locals took turn and turn around to invite him, and the other Yugoslav men that were sent there, to Sunday lunch. My father accepted with gratitude the lamb roast that always featured on his neighbours\u2019 tables and never had the heart to tell them he loathed the very smell of it. The local Lutheran minister invited them, all Orthodox, to come to his church and worship in their own way. \u201cWe are all Christians,\u201d he told them. Image the impact of that statement on an impressionable young man fleeing a region where people of different religion were murdering each other with abandon under the pretext of war. A psychologist friend who came from the Netherlands after the second world war confirmed to me that Australians were very sympathetic to the refugees, above all recognising in quirky behaviour an involuntary response to what we would now call PTSD or moral injury. The hostility to foreigners that accompanied the mass migration of the 1950s had not arisen yet. In the 1970s, it was an LNP government that over-rode campaigning by the ALP, concerned for Australian jobs, and others with more racist concerns, to allow Vietnamese \u201cboat people\u201d to stay. Words like \u201cfloodgates\u201d and \u201cpseudo-refugees\u201d were used. Gough Whitlam coined the term \u201cqueue jumpers\u201d. Bob Hawke, then ACTU president, said only refugees we selected from offshore camps should be allowed. We will decide who comes to this country, as today\u2019s Government might have said. More than 80,000 anti-Communist Vietnamese arrived in Australia in the following 15 years: our allies in the Vietnam War, whom we did not abandon when the war was lost. At the press conference announcing the humanitarian response, then foreign minister Andrew Peacock and immigration minister Michael MacKellar urged politicians \u201cnot to subordinate the issues ... to electoral considerations, not to exaggerate the dimensions of the problem, not to attempt to exploit the assumed fears of sections of the Australian public, and not to forget the human tragedy represented by these few small boats.\u201d Read that quote again. It\u2019s dismaying to realise how far Australian government has fallen from championship of liberty and humanitarianism. For the Liberals, it\u2019s a betrayal of their very name. For Labor, well, it\u2019s business as usual. In his illuminating book, The Long Road Home: the aftermath of the Second World War, Ben Shephard remarks: \u201cHow, in our modern culture \u2013 where evil is sexy, goodness is dull, and organised goodness is dullest of all \u2013 can we find a way to make organised altruism interesting?\u201d How indeed, within the individualistic I\u2019m-alright-Jack paradigm we are disappearing into? A few years ago I interviewed an Iranian woman who had fled the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Her home was as elegant as she was, and a small platter of brightly-coloured dried fruit, beautifully arranged in geometric lines, waited on the table to accompany our tea. She and her husband were scientists and had hiked over the mountains to Pakistan, carrying their baby, when the Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s harsh Islamist regime - particularly hard on woman - was established. Their son turned out to be gay, now a capital offence in Iran. I asked how a couple of young urban professionals knew how to get across the mountains. \u201cWe had help,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019People smugglers\u2019 we\u2019d call them now.\u201d People smugglers, she murmured again. She paused, sighed, and offered me more tea. A previous version of this article stated that NATO acted against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2001. It has been corrected to 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
