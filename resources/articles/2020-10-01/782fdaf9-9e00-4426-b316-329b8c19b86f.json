Six years ago, Jane was able to escape from domestic violence. She had been working tirelessly to support her children and a husband who claimed to have no money. When she left, she discovered he had been earning more than $250,000 a year. \u201cI had become so tired and so browbeaten just through the process of managing it day by day that I thought, how do I move myself out of this situation?\u201d she says. \u201cIt took so much energy to actually pick myself up and take my children.\u201d Like many victims of family violence, Jane appeared on paper to have it together. She is a former dean of a university, and has a master\u2019s degree. But in private, she was subject to years of financial, emotional and physical abuse that left deep scars on her family. \u201cI had to stop working because I had a traumatised daughter,\u201d Jane says. \u201cEven now, she still has moments where her trauma becomes so much it is unmanageable. The impact of the financial abuse permeates through everything.\u201d Australia\u2019s domestic violence laws repeatedly fail victims of abuse. The understanding and management of trauma - suffered by parents and children - is lacking. For Jane, financial abuse meant she had no choice but to work herself to the bone, frightened by the fallout if she didn\u2019t. Her solicitor husband had withheld his high earnings and left Jane to manage the strain of supporting the household. \u201cPsychological abuse and financial abuse are part of the same cycle,\u201d she says. \u201cI actually collapsed and had to go to hospital because I had absolutely flogged myself, working incredibly hard with two small children. After we separated, and I received the child support statements, I realised that while I\u2019d been working so hard, he was earning more than a quarter of a million dollars a year.\u201d Money is a significant factor in domestic violence: up to 90% of people who seek support are also experiencing financial abuse. The PwC report, A high price to pay, found 49.5% of women have experienced violence, partner emotional abuse or stalking since the age of 15, and estimates the cost of violence against women to be $21.7 billion a year. \u201cMost of that cost is borne by victims themselves,\u201d Jane says. \u201cI work at a women\u2019s centre, and the overarching issue with many of those women is finance.\u201d Financial abuse comes in many shapes and forms. Some victims have their income taken from them, controlled by a partner in the form of an allowance, or have their spending heavily scrutinised. Some are punished for buying certain items or excluded from making financial decisions. Crucially, many are left without access to money they could use to escape. \u201cWomen still living with domestic violence don\u2019t leave because they can\u2019t leave - there just isn\u2019t any money.\u201d Jane says. \u201cWe can give advice on how to manage finances but the bottom line is there\u2019s just not enough money. There\u2019s not enough money to survive after you\u2019ve gone through domestic violence and a family law system that won\u2019t fight hard for you. The systems that manage it, and the leaders within those systems, need to be reviewed.\u201d Jane says the ongoing impact of domestic violence and financial abuse is significant, and finding sustained help is hard. \u201cOne of the things we do really badly is looking at the point of incidence and only supporting that initial process of removal and management. We\u2019re good at intervention and stabilisation, but very bad at development and creating security.\u201d Jane feels the residual effects of domestic violence still, six years later. \u201cI have had a knife held to my throat, I\u2019ve been strangled. My ex-husband threw my son across the room. He would say to me, if you leave me, I will hunt you down and shoot you like a dog. \u201cThat trauma stays with you. Even when you have therapists managing your triggers, it still comes back.\u201d Creating systems for long-term independence is critical. \u201cThe greatest thing for survivors of domestic violence is to get support, and it\u2019s so hard to get on a continual basis,\u201d Jane says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fighting for your financial freedom, when you\u2019re fighting for the rights and safety of your children \u2026 when someone\u2019s standing with you, you do feel just that little bit stronger.\u201d If you or someone you know is affected by domestic violence, please call 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au. In an emergency, call 000. If you are concerned that you or another man are being abusive, call the Men\u2019s Referral Service: 1300 766 491.
