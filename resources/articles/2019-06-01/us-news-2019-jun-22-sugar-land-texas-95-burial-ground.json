The scene in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land is more remarkable than it first appears. Construction crews working for the local school district uncovered human remains in February last year in what proved to be an unmarked burial ground for 95 people. They are thought to be African American prisoners aged 14 to 70 forced into backbreaking work on sugar plantations in a post-civil war system known as convict leasing that has been described as the continuation of slavery. The find was vindication for Reginald Moore, a local historian who was convinced Sugar Land\u2019s soil hid a dark secret underneath a stretch of suburbia that resembles so much of the modern American landscape. But even as the unearthing of the \u201cSugar Land 95\u201d was hailed as a major discovery that helps shine light on a shameful episode in American history, Moore geared up for what would prove a yearlong battle against those he sensed would prefer that Sugar Land\u2019s past remain buried. Sugar Land is now a booming slice of Houston\u2019s metropolis. The population of the one-time company town rose from 2,082 in 1960 to more than 118,000 today. A roadside sign invites drivers to tour model homes in the Imperial master-planned development, motto: \u201cLiving the Sweet Life!\u201d The name of the minor league baseball club that plays around the corner, the Sugar Land Skeeters, is a jocular nod to the region\u2019s copious mosquito population. But it was not always this way. These suburbs were built over sugar plantations which consolidated into the Imperial Sugar company in the early years of the last century. It was the sugar industry that employed convict leasing where black prisoners would be rented out as free labor as farms struggled to cope with the loss of free labor with the end of slavery. New laws in the south targeted African Americans and many prisoners, often black men given harsh sentences for minor offenses, were hired out to private businessmen and forced to toil in frequently lethal conditions. The practice was so common in Sugar Land, an area that now regularly features on \u201cbest places to live\u201d lists, that it was once known as the \u201cHell Hole on the Brazos\u201d. Sugar Land is \u201cbuilding right over its history. The homes are built right over graves, unbeknownst to the homeowners,\u201d said Barbara Crump Jones, a member of Moore\u2019s group, the Convict Leasing and Labor Project. The debate on how to remember the bloody past through the treatment of the 95 bodies has been intense. The school district wanted to move the remains about half a mile away to the Old Imperial Farm cemetery, a modest plot containing the remains of inmates and guards who died at a local prison between 1912 and 1942. But community activists fought the plan and the district, which said it would cost $18m to modify the education centre project and went to court for the right to relocate the remains, eventually changed its stance. It held a press conference on Monday to herald the passage of a state law that will allow Fort Bend county to own and operate the cemetery \u2013 the prelude to what is likely to be the creation of a substantial memorial where the bodies were found. \u201cIt\u2019s really unique. I think there is no other site like this in the country where this many remains associated with the history of convict leasing have been found,\u201d said Caleb McDaniel, an associate history professor at Rice University. He was among about 80 activists, experts, local officials and community members who gathered in a meeting room last week for a ceremony to mark Juneteenth \u2013 the public holiday that celebrates the end of slavery \u2013 and remember the 95 dead. \u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling, we\u2019ve been fighting,\u201d said Moore, a stocky 59-year-old whose interest in convict leasing was sparked when he worked as a guard at a nearby prison farm in the 1980s as Ronald Reagan\u2019s war on drugs crammed facilities with black inmates serving long sentences for possessing often small quantities of crack cocaine. A thin layer of perspiration glistened below the brim of Moore\u2019s baseball cap as he sat outside on a typically humid Texas summer night. He wore a T-shirt with an image of Martin Luther King. His view encompassed a park, empty fields and the silos of the former Imperial Sugar refinery complex, part of which is now a children\u2019s interactive museum and hosts a farmer\u2019s market. \u201cHopefully we can close the deals to be able to get the people interred correctly, get a memorial and a museum,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI believe they\u2019re coming round to want to do the right thing. And the right thing is to leave the bodies where they are.\u201d Juneteenth commemorates 19 June 1865, when slavery officially ended in Texas \u2013 two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation had come into effect. It is a holiday in most states, including Texas, which also observes Confederate Heroes Day. Legislation calling for reparations to be paid to descendants of the Sugar Land 95, should DNA testing of the bones make identification possible, failed to gain traction in the Texas legislature this year, but Moore believes the idea is appropriate. \u201cThe word reparations means to repair and there\u2019s a lot of repairing needs to be done,\u201d he said. Convict leasing in Texas officially ended in 1912 after a series of newspaper expos\u00e9s, but lawmakers had an idea: make inmates work for the state instead. But to some extent, in the era of mass incarceration of black Americans, its legacy still lingers. Today, Texas holds more prisoners than any other state and is one of a handful of southern states that do not pay inmates for working typical prison jobs. Texas Correctional Industries, the state\u2019s prison labour department, sold $84m worth of items and services in fiscal year 2017. A national analysis in 2017 by the Prison Policy Initiative found that on average, incarcerated people earned between 86 cents and $3.45 a day for prison jobs \u2013 with rates on the decline. California reportedly saves $100m a year by using prisoners to fight fires. Black people comprise 40% of America\u2019s incarcerated population but only 13% of the country\u2019s inhabitants. \u201cThe convict lease system is the clearest bridge from slavery to the system of mass incarceration that we have today,\u201d said Jay Jenkins, an attorney with the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition. \u201cFor too long in the state of Texas and across the United States these things have been viewed as matters of inconvenience and not as the legacy of cruelty and horror that we need to reconcile with.\u201d Moore acted as emcee for the Juneteenth event, which featured speeches, historical presentations and a church choir that led the room in the singing of Lift Every Voice and Sing, also known as the Negro National Anthem: Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us Facing the rising sun of our new day begun Let us march on till victory is won Afterwards, as night fell, the group headed outside to a basketball court in the park. \u201cThis is for the ancestors, the ones who were beaten, ostracised,\u201d Moore said, as battery-operated candles flickered orange and were held aloft. In the background, the giant neon Imperial Sugar sign at the old factory glowed red and blue. The building is disused, though there are plans to turn it into a boutique hotel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
