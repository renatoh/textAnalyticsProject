The measure, which passed 221-201 in the House, lifts the US Treasury\u2019s borrowing authority until March 2015, postponing any future showdowns until after November\u2019s midterm elections. Only 28 Republicans voted for the so-called \u201cclean\u201d debt bill, which had no extraneous requests attached. They were joined by 193 Democrats, without whom the bill would never have passed. Conservatives in the GOP had been urging the leadership to make increasing the borrowing limit contingent upon a policy demand, but in the end the party was unable to coalesce around a single proposal. The vote marked a final capitulation from Republicans to the Obama administration, which had been refusing to negotiate over a bill to increase the Treasury\u2019s borrowing authority. The Democrat-controlled Senate, which had also been insisting on a clean debt limit raise, is expected to pass the bill in the coming days. Earlier on Tuesday, John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, told fellow lawmakers he would quickly bring legislation to increase the Treasury\u2019s debt limit, without attaching any of the policy demands the party had been considering. Combined recently passed budget compromise, Tuesday\u2019s vote probably draws a line under the series of fiscal battles that have dominated Washington politics in recent years. The US government has been using what it calls \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to keep its accounts rolling since Friday. The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, had warned Congress that those measures would soon expire, saying the debt ceiling would need to be raised by 27 February to avoid a possible default. With the House due to embark on a two-week recess, that left just a handful of days to increase the debt limit or risk default. The White House steadfastly refused to negotiate with Republicans, saying they were holding the economy to ransom. Republican leaders, conscious their party has a reputation for obstructionism \u2013 which was compounded during last October\u2019s failed debt limit fight \u2013 showed no enthusiasm for another showdown with the White House in an election year. Still, they openly \u2013 if half-heartedly \u2013 toyed with making approval for an extended debt ceiling contingent on a number of different proposals, such as approval of the the Keystone XL pipeline or attacks on aspects of Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. Neither idea gained much traction, and on Monday night, Boehner presented a last-ditch proposal linking the debt ceiling rise to the re-introduction of military pension benefits, which had been cut from the recent budget. By Tuesday morning, it was evident that Republicans were unwilling to rally around that idea. A GOP source confirmed that Boehner told fellow Republicans in a private meeting that he would table a vote a clean debt limit bill, a move that will require an overwhelming majority of Democrats to pass. \u201cYou\u2019ve all known that our members are not crazy about voting to increase the debt ceiling,\u201d Boehner later told reporters, according to Politico. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ll let the Democrats put the votes up; we\u2019ll put a minimum number of votes up to get it passed.\u201d The saga underscores the disarray in the Republican party and mirrors Boehner\u2019s recently stalled push for immigration reform. He and other leaders had hoped to pass measures before the summer that would enable a path to legal recognition for undocumented workers. Top GOP legislators presented their plans at a Republican retreat last month, portraying the move necessary in order to rebrand the party and improve its appeal to Hispanic voters. Less than a week later, Boehner conceded the pitch did not go down well with rank-and-file members, saying immigration reform \u201cwould be difficult to pass this year\u201d. Boehner tried to blame his immigration U-turn on lack of trust in the Obama administration. On Tuesday, he adopted a similar approach when trying to explain the debt limit surrender. \u201cOur members are also very upset with the president,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t negotiate. He won\u2019t deal with our long-term spending problems without us raising taxes. He won\u2019t even sit down and discuss these issues. He\u2019s the one driving up the debt and the question they\u2019re asking is, why should I deal with his debt limit?\u201d Despite Republican infighting, Washington has experienced a flurry of bipartisan legislative progress over the past month, passing the budget, appropriations and farm bills in relatively quick succession. Presuming the debt limit legislation passes \u2013 which is not guaranteed, given the strength of GOP opposition to a clean bill and the limited time needed to find the votes \u2013 Congress should have created the space for other, non-essential legislation in the spring. However, with the midterm elections nine months away, Republicans do not want to rock the boat with bills that could prove politically unpopular with their base."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
