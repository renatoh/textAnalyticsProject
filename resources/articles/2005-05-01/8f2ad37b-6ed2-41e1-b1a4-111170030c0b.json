It is the second time Moyes has won the award for his success on Merseyside, having been similarly honoured two years ago when Everton missed out on qualification for the Uefa Cup only on the last day of the season. In the intervening season, however, they were considerably less successful. \"At the start of the season I was thinking to myself, 'How can we avoid relegation?'\" Moyes said. \"Then we lost our best player when Wayne Rooney left for Manchester United. A year ago I was just relieved to have escaped relegation, so it's amazing how football can turn around.\" The league-winning manager has won the award in 28 of the last 31 years but Jose Mourinho, who was not at last night's ceremony in Nottingham, will have only the rival Barclays Manager of the Year title to show for Chelsea's record-breaking season. There was a special presentation to honour Sir Bobby Robson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
