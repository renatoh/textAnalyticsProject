I spent 22 weeks off work and I had a nervous break down. If it weren't for the Rev Pennington I wouldn't be here today. I was recommended to him by my GP. He helped nurse me back to health. I was so ill, taking loads of Valium and smoking too much. He hypnotised me and I haven't smoked a cigarette since. Roger Gregory, a mate from years ago, also helped me through those tough times. Roger had a Sony video camera. He suggested I took it on the moors as a way to relax. This new camera meant a lot to Roger but he was thinking of me and let me use it. When I got up on the moors I saw some deer a mile and a half away. I got within 20 yards and was so excited, looking through the viewfinder, thinking I was going to get some lovely shots. But when I got home and turned the camera on, all I could see was heather, stones, and gorse. I realised that when I started across the moor I had put the camera on but once I'd got to the deer I'd turned it off. But it didn't stop there and I kept recording the moors and the wildlife that inhabited it. Another person who has helped me a lot is my best mate Michael Warren. His nickname is Spider, but I call him brother. Michael used to work for a building firm and he gave me scaffolding that couldn't be used any more, to construct hides. He also helped me to get some compensation after my accident, with which I bought my own camera. I've now made 28 films. The first one I showed in the village hall. It was three hours long, but people just loved it. Then I started doing shows all over the place. At a show in Honington a man with a top hat and moustache - a really smart gentleman - bought some films from me. I later learned that he was a writer from the Daily Telegraph called Willy Poole and that he had written an article about the films. Then a man called James Cutler from Yorkshire Television rang me up and suggested we do a 50-minute documentary called The Secret of Happiness. My wife Julie answered 4,500 letters in the three months following that programme in 1992. Then David Parker came along, with whom I did a couple of jobs for HTV. Later he said he had a job for me at BBC2 doing 10 programmes. A lot of the thanks has to go to David Parker, he pushed me and worked very hard. The main advice he gave me was: \"Johnny, you've got to be Johnny Kingdom because there is only one Johnny Kingdom. You must stay like you are because the people love you in the south-west and we may go further.\" \u00b7 Johnny Kingdom was talking to Matt Keating. The TV series, Johnny Kingdom, A Year on Exmoor continues on BBC2 and his autobiography, Johnny Kingdom: A Wildlife on Exmoor is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
