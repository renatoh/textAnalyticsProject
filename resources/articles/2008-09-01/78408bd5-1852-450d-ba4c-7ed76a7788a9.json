The first insight into his views on the growing pressure to tackle City greed comes in an interview for the October issue of the current affairs magazine Prospect, to be published the day after the Prime Minister's make-or-break conference speech. The Foreign Secretary suggested that he had not given up hope of introducing a form of carbon rationing, which would price consumers out of gas-guzzling cars and cheap flights by giving every citizen an annual carbon quota. Miliband championed personal carbon trading as Environment Secretary but the plan was ditched after Gordon Brown became leader. In his interview, however, Miliband said 'the whole point about good ideas is that they don't die'. The lengthy exposition of his views, over 11 pages, marks the first glimpse of the potential policies of a Miliband leadership bid on the eve of the annual party conference, which will see Brown and his rival pitched against each other in a battle for Labour hearts and minds. Unlike previous years, there are no real ideological arguments dividing delegates gathering in Manchester today: no epic battles over privatisation, nor Iraq, nor pensions. It's worse than that. 'The only issue is the leadership: is Gordon up to it?' says a government aide. After 10 days of clumsy plotting left him wounded but not dispatched, Brown has earned a temporary reprieve. The one thing more toxic to Labour MPs than their leader is a City meltdown threatening jobs, savings and pensions. Squabbling now would look petty. Besides, even some backbenchers anxious to overthrow Brown would rather suffer him than join some of the plotters who surfaced last week. They have not forgotten how Siobhan McDonagh's sister Margaret, when party general secretary, tore into those straying off-message, or how Jim Dowd enforced discipline as a whip. 'Wrong people, wrong plot, wrong time,' says one senior backbencher who shares the rebels' doubts about Brown. But the insurrection is only suspended, not quashed. Brown's task this week, according to one cabinet minister, is to 'give them confidence', to show he is a going concern. Can Brown, whose impassioned sermons from the conference pulpit once stirred Labour souls, make his party believe again? And if not, will they put their faith in Miliband ? The leader's speech is still enduring interminable redrafts but, helped by allies including Miliband's minister brother Ed, it is taking shape. It is Brown's response to the global banking crisis that will dominate. None the less aides are worried that expectations have risen impossibly high - and that critics have only gone quiet so they can say they gave Brown a fair hearing before damning him. 'Even if it's Martin Luther King, some people will say it wasn't enough,' says one Downing Street staffer. Brown has taken no chances. Apart from Alistair Darling, other cabinet ministers will have just six minutes for their platform speeches, after which they must take delegates' questions. Miliband will barely have time to clear his throat. Which explains why the Foreign Secretary is popping up everywhere else. Yesterday's Times was invited into his Primrose Hill kitchen, to chat about his schooldays and his marriage: he told yesterday's Daily Mirror how he took time out to escort his son to nursery. The only topic now off limits is the leadership campaign: officially at least, as he told the Mirror: 'There isn't a vacancy.' But there is a vacuum, and Miliband fills it. He will star at tonight's rally organised by the Blairite think-tank Progress; he will also deliver a lecture today for the Fabian Society, campaigning for higher taxes for the rich. In his Prospect interview he ducked questions about tax, but said it was impossible to care about poverty without 'caring about the gap [between rich and poor]'. And he acknowledged public anger at executives who did not justify their pay: 'The gap between the chief executive and the average salary on the shopfloor has exploded, and this is a reflection less of market forces and more of moral norms. What really hacks people off about some of the top 0.1 per cent is when they get extra for underperformance. People want checks and balances that discipline the abuse of market power.' If such flashes of political ankle can convince the grassroots he is not a Blairite throwback, then last week's shambolic revolt may gain what it critically lacked: a purpose. Conspiracy theories about the failed uprising that began with McDonagh's sacking for requesting papers to nominate an alternative leader are still flying in Manchester. Could Hazel Blears, whose unsuccessful deputy leadership campaign was backed by several of the plotters, be behind it? Perhaps - except that David Cairns, the Scottish minister who emerged from obscurity last week to resign, is not close to Blears - and her close ally, the MP Steve Pound, condemned the plot. As for the network of Blairites running the Progress group, while some did speak to rebels, the advice was that their tactics were ineffective. The revolt failed because it lacked a mastermind and a candidate, leaving McDonagh, Cairns, Labour's vice-chair Joan Ryan and others sacrificing their jobs in vain while the cabinet nervously sat tight. 'You shouldn't send troops into a war you can't win when you don't have a general,' says one government source. In Downing Street none the less, the mood is described as 'desperately grim'. Cabinet ministers openly scoff at the 'dysfunctional' centre of government. MPs wonder why Brown did not just call the rebels' bluff, send nomination papers to all MPs and dare them to act, assuming that Miliband lacked the numbers and the nerve to mount a real challenge now. What is missing is leadership. And it came from an unexpected source. With a glittering guest list from the music mogul Simon Cowell to footballer Sol Campbell, last July's auction of sporting memorabilia in aid of Labour successfully pried open supporters' wallets. But it may have raised something more valuable: for a plot began here to save Labour from itself. Alastair Campbell and John Prescott, both hawking themselves as prizes, spent the evening sharing their frustrations at the party's unravelling. The result was their 'Go Fourth' campaign for a Labour fourth term, launched last week with Prescott's friend Richard Caborn and Glenys Kinnock, in an article for the New Statesman magazine barely mentioning Brown. This is about saving a party, not a leader. The baton was picked up on Friday by Martin Salter, the Labour MP for Reading West, a veteran rebel irritated enough by the plotters to call Campbell. Now he is circulating a letter to MPs urging them to pledge to 'actively support' and defend the government. It is backed by mainstream MPs from the left-wing kingmaker Jon Cruddas to minister Joan Ruddock. Signing - or not signing - is fast becoming a test of loyalty. None the less too many backbenchers are publicly despairing, too many ministers privately resigned, for such sticking plasters to hold. A cabinet minister suggests Brown may only have nine months left - up to June's European elections: the joke is that Labour is more likely to come fourth than 'Go Fourth'. And after Brown yesterday took credit for the City's astonishing recovery, he may get the blame if it crashes again. The Tories will use their own party conference to blame the crisis directly on his approach as Chancellor, a charge some Labour MPs fear may be justified. It is a sign of his continued fragility that nobody is now sure Brown's long-awaited cabinet reshuffle - pencilled in for early October - will even happen. He certainly cannot afford to provoke anyone by moving Miliband. More likely are smaller changes, sharpening the cabinet's attacking edge. Brown has long itched to combine the three 'regional' cabinet ministers for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland into one cabinet post, a probable promotion for Europe minister Jim Murphy. Murphy is not the only ex-Blairite rising: Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland Secretary and ex-Tory defector, is tipped for promotion to a political role co-ordinating the election fightback in which he could use his inside knowledge against David Cameron. Meanwhile Ruth Kelly, the devoutly Catholic Transport Secretary, is agonising over whether to back the government's bill on embryo research in Parliament next month or quit. But individual fates matter less in the face of today's poll, which suggests that unless someone turns it around Labour will be cast into the wilderness at the next election. There is talk of a profound realignment of politics, the death of New Labour: like the Lehman bankers cast out with their belongings in cardboard boxes, Labour could lose everything. Which means that while Brown's stock has rallied, the threat of hostile takeover looms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
