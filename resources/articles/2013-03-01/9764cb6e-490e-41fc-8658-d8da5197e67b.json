In spite of dire warnings of obstructionism by Senate Republicans, Obama has seen his main choices go through without too much difficulty. Approval came after the Obama administration caved in to demands by the intelligence committee to see all classified legal advice prepared by the Justice Department about the use of drones. The Democratic chairwoman of the intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein, said: \"I have reached an agreement with the White House to provide the committee access to all opinions related to the targeted killing of Americans in a way that allows members to fulfill their oversight responsibilities.\" She added: \"I am pleased the administration has made this information available. It is important for the committee to do its work and will pave the way for the confirmation of John Brennan to be CIA director.\" She urged the Senate to act quickly to confirm Brennan. \"He draws on a deep well of experience \u2013 25 years as a CIA analyst, chief of station, manager, head of counter-terrorism efforts and White House homeland security adviser,\" she said. Although Brennan's nomination still has to go before the whole Senate, Brennan looks set to join defence secretary Chuck Hagel, secretary of state John Kerry and Treasury secretary Jack Lew in Obama's new cabinet. Kerry and Lew sailed through the nominating process. Hagel's was the most difficult nomination, with Republican senators and some Democrats expressing concern that he was insufficiently supportive of Israel and too conciliatory towards Iran. But the Brennan nomination also carried risks. Republicans senators had been concerned about details of the attack in Libya on the US mission in Benghazi \u2013 in which four Americans, including the ambassador, Chris Stevens, were killed \u2013 and been pressing for classified reports. Brennan, 57, had been in line as director of the CIA in the first Obama administration, but withdrew his name from consideration in the face of concern in Congress about the use of torture during the Bush administration. Instead, Brennan, a CIA veteran, joined the Obama administration as deputy national security adviser, a post that did not require Senate confirmation. Republicans had been threatening to block the nomination, insisting that a simple majority vote in the Senate was insufficient, and that it would require 60 of the 100 Senate votes. But the release of the classified material may see them withdraw that threat. The White House had initially released only some of the classified documents relating to the legal advice on drones. But the senators kept pressing to see them and the White House capitulated. The White House also released some documents relating to Benghazi, but Republicans complained they were insufficient. White House press secretary Jay Carney said: \"It is in keeping with the president's commitment, which he reiterated in his state of the union address, to work with Congress to be as transparent as possible about these actions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
