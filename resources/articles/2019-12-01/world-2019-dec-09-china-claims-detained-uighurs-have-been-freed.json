In response to growing international criticism of the detention of up to 1.5 million people in re-education and other internment camps, the Xinjiang governor, Shohrat Zakir, told reporters in Beijing that they had \u201creturned to society\u201d. China has long said it does not run what witnesses and human rights advocates have described as re-education camps, where detainees are forced to undergo political indoctrination, but offers free \u201cvocational training\u201d to residents who attend voluntarily. Zakir said on Monday: \u201cAt present, all the trainees who participated \u2026 have completed their studies, found stable employment with the help of the government and have improved their quality of life and live a happy life.\u201d He said the programme focused on teaching Chinese language skills, law and vocational skills to \u201celiminate extremism\u201d. However, classified government documents seen by a media consortium, including the Guardian, have undermined those claims. The documents outline a strategy to detain ethnic minorities who have not committed crimes for the sake of \u201ceducational transformation\u201d. The directives include security measures to ensure \u201cno escapes\u201d and that \u201cstudents\u201d should be held for at least one year. Uighurs and Kazakhs outside China have told the Guardian their family members in Xinjiang remain detained in camps. Those who are not in the camps are subject to constant surveillance, including having Chinese officials living in their homes, and live under the threat of being sent to a centre. Zakir said those reports were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d but declined to give the number of people attending the centres. He said the number who took part was \u201cdynamic\u201d and could not be estimated. In recent days, Beijing has launched an aggressive propaganda campaign in response to criticism of its policies in Xinjiang. Last Friday the state broadcaster CCTV released a documentary called Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang, which included footage of terrorist attacks. Over the last year, China has put on several curated, state-organised trips to the region. The remarks represent an escalation in rhetoric directed at the US, as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a trade war form more than a year. Beijing has also labelled the US a \u201cblack hand\u201d behind ongoing anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Last week, US politicians passed legislation that would sanction Chinese officials involved in the crackdown in Xinjiang. Zakir said: \u201cThe US is getting restless and has launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang. But no force can stop Xinjiang\u2019s progress toward stability and development. \u201cWhen the lives of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were seriously threatened by terrorism, the US turned a deaf ear. Now that Xinjiang is steadily developing and people of all ethnicities are living and working in peace, the US feels uneasy, and attacks and smears Xinjiang.\u201d Nicholas Bequelin of Amnesty International said: \u201cWhile this may sound like progress, it\u2019s more likely just the Chinese propaganda machine\u2019s latest attempt to shift the narrative on its horrendous human rights violations in Xinjiang in the face of growing international condemnation. \u201cIf Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities are really being released from these repressive detention camps, then the onus is on the Chinese government to prove it. \u201cThe government should, at the very least, allow independent UN experts to assess the situation, and allow Uighurs and members of other ethnic minorities to freely communicate with their relatives overseas. Until now, this is something the authorities have repeatedly refused to do. \u201cAs ever, it\u2019s almost impossible to independently verify the Chinese government\u2019s claims given the extreme constraints on reporting in the region and the authorities\u2019 attempts to cut it off from the outside world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
