Today, as alluring as it might be to vote for the Liberal Democrats or the Tories, it is worth remembering that no other party has the track record, or commitment to women that the Labour party has. Of course, 13 years later it is hard to remember what life was like for women before the arrival of the Labour government in 1997 \u2013 personally I have trouble recalling what I was doing this time last Tuesday \u2013 so here are a few reminders of the changes Labour have introduced since 1997 that have vastly improved the lives of millions of women: The Forced Marriage Act; the minimum wage, which helps around a million people, two thirds of them women; more than 120 specialist domestic violence courts and 28 sexual assault referral centres; the right to request flexible working for those with caring responsibilities; the Pension Credit, free bus passes for over-60s and pension reforms that will allow a million more people to accumulate a state second pension \u2013 all of which aid more women than men; the Health in Pregnancy Grant \u2013 \u00a3190 for each woman; a maternity leave increase from 18 weeks to 12 months; doubled maternity pay; paternity and adoption leave; greatly improved breast-cancer treatment, and much more. \u2724 There are 95 female Labour MPs \u2013 three times the number of those in all the other parties put together. According to a Fawcett Society report, at the current rate, while it would take Labour 20 years to get an equal gender split in the House of Commons, it would take the Liberal Democrats twice that, and the Conservatives 400 years. \u2724 As a non-election aside, Naomi Campbell's revelation that she sometimes survives for days at a time on naught but maple syrup, cayenne pepper and lemon juice, rather makes us wonder, might the famously fiery supermodel not have such a short fuse if she actually ate once in a while?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
