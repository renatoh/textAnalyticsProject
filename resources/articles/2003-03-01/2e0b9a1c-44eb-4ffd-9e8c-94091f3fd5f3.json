It's become a topic in the media. And I'm beginning to feel the promises about the NHS are going to come through. A year ago I was a bit cynical about Agenda for Change [a pay regrading exercise involving 1.2 million NHS staff]. It seemed all talk and no action. But the proposals are now published and by and large the NHS gets a good deal, particularly in London. It will make terms and conditions more egalitarian, with a single pay scale and the same holidays and sickness benefit for everyone. Engineering staff in the NHS did not do particularly well out of the job appraisal exercise and outside London they may gain little. But London weighting will double to 20% of salary, up to a maximum of \u00a35,000 a year. That's going to make a big difference to recruitment here, particularly of craftsmen. When I'm on 24-hour call I also get a bonus. A year ago I said I wouldn't consider moving from this job until I'd finished my MBA. The final exams are on April 10 and that's when I'll reassess my career. But I'll definitely stay in the public sector. I get a lot from it. I particularly enjoy the type of engineering work I can do for the NHS, solving problems to produce real benefit for the patients. Over the last year we completed work on a \u00a31.3m decontamination unit and it's now fully operational. It establishes full traceability of all surgical instruments so the hospital has an exact record of every patient, surgeon, nurse and operative who came into contact with each one. It's a state-of-the-art system and we delivered it on budget. My job has expanded over the last year to include responsibility for estates management at Coppetts Wood hospital, a two-bed isolation unit in Muswell Hill in north London for the most highly contagious diseases. I didn't get any extra pay for that, but I've been given a full-time assistant. Public voices: March 21 2002 Estates manager, Royal Free hospital, Hampstead, London Salary: \u00a336,000 A big commitment over the past few months has been developing a state-of-the-art decontamination facility at this hospital. We are currently half-way through a \u00a31.3m project that will give us the most advanced centre in Britain - and probably the world. The danger of cross infection and spreading variant CJD, however remote, has made us all a lot more aware of the high priority to be given to decontamination. The aim is to establish full traceability of surgical instruments. If a patient develops symptoms of CJD, we would then be able to trace all the other patients who came into contact with the same instruments. We need to know where each surgical instrument was stored, when it was used and by which surgeon, on which patient. We want to record how and when it was cleaned in which washer/disinfector, how it was sterilised and packed and where it was stored ready for the next operation. For the first time we are using bar code technology to automatically record these details. I'm also responsible for all the energy consumed at the Royal Free. Last year we saved over \u00a31m by using a combined heat and power plant and every penny was all ploughed back into extra services for patients. That gives me tremendous satisfaction. It seems that the work of public servants - particularly in the health service - is more appreciated by the general public than it was a year ago. I feel more valued. There seem to be a lot more job opportunities in my field. Hospitals have more money to spend on the sort of projects I do. Although there are more opportunities, I won't consider moving before I finish my MBA. A major problem we experience at the Royal Free is recruiting and retaining many types of staff. A main reason for this is the high cost of property around Hampstead where the cheapest one-bedroom flat costs in excess of \u00a3200,000. Health service rates of pay prevent most Royal Free staff from living locally and so commuting is the norm. The government says these issues will be addressed by the Agenda for Change - but after three years of negotiations many staff remain sceptical that major change will ever happen. I got a 3% pay increase last year, bringing my salary up to \u00a336,000, plus a bonus for periods when I'm on 24-hour call. I still get a lot from my job and my contribution to health care. I'm meant to work 37 hours a week, but I currently do 42. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Estates manager, Royal Free hospital, Hampstead, London Salary \u00a335,000 I'm responsible for all the energy consumed at the Royal Free hospital in London. We're unusual in that we generate our electricity on site and sell the surplus. We have a combined heat and power plant using a jet engine gas turbine. It's been my project for eight years. We've reduced our energy consumption by 40% and that's saving \u00a31m a year that can be ploughed back into services for patients. There are eight schemes like this in the NHS. What makes our project unique is that we've coupled it to a new kind of refrigeration technology called absorption chilling. About 90% of the hospital is air-conditioned and we're getting that at virtually no cost, using waste energy from the gas turbine to cool the building. As well as saving money, the schemes are good for the environment. The CHP project reduced our CO2 emissions by 14,000 tonnes a year and the absorption chillers eliminated the use of ozone depleting CFC gasses in our air conditioning plant. My first job was as an apprentice miner in the early 1980s. I could see the writing was on the wall after the strike and I took a degree in mechanical plant engineering at what was then Nottingham Trent polytechnic. My student placement was at the Royal Free and they offered me a job when I graduated. I do think I'm performing a public service and that is an important part of my life. I am a firm believer in the basic principles of the NHS and am pleased to be able to contribute to improving its performance. I get a lot of satisfaction from developing schemes for the hospital because I know the money saved is redirected into patient care. Over the 10 years I've been here we've saved \u00a310m. That's a really useful contribution. There are about 60 working in the hospital's estates department. I have one undergraduate assistant and the area I manage is contracted out to a private firm with a manager and 10 engineers, reporting to me. I get \u00a335,000 a year, plus a bonus for periods when I'm on 24-hour call. Until my salary was increased after a regrading exercise a year ago I think I could have earned substantially more in the private sector. There are plenty of jobs in energy-related companies that are directly comparable with what I do. But the discrepancy is not so huge now. To get more I'd have to switch to more commercially focused project work. I wouldn't rule out going somewhere else, but I get a lot of satisfaction from what I do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
