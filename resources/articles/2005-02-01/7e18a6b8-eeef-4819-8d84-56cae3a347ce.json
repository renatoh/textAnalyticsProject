Rhianna is as a big a fan as I am, calling it the, \"best MMORPG experience\". I've ranted about it recently, and thoroughly recommend it. Elsewhere this week Steve Boxer was dismissive about the latest FIFA game, Uefa Champions League 2004-2005. Quite rightly he wondered why you would buy this when you can, \"buy a copy of Pro Evolution Soccer 4, with its silky passing system and immaculate player movement\". Finally I had a look at Mario power Tennis for the Gamecube, a decent enough tennis game that will appeal after the pub. Next week's reviews include Star Wars: Republic Commando."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
