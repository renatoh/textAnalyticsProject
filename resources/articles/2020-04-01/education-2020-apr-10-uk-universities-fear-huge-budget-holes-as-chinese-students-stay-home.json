Nearly 120,000 students from China currently study at British universities, with their tuition fees a key source of income. But the survey by the British Council found that only one in four students said they were still going ahead with plans to study abroad next year. Of the 8,000 Chinese students surveyed, 22% said they were likely or very likely to cancel their plans, while 39% said they were unsure. Just 27% said they were not likely to cancel. One senior university leader told the Guardian that international enrolments at many UK institutions could fall by 50% to 100% in the next academic year. Universities UK \u2013 which represents 137 UK institutions \u2013 said it was requesting increased funding and other emergency support from the government, in return for a temporary cap on domestic student recruitment and cuts within the sector. In Edinburgh, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed she would fully pass on any bailout funds coming from the UK government to Scottish universities, and that talks were ongoing over further support. \u201cThe scale of the financial crisis facing universities is well understood by ministers,\u201d the Scottish first minister said. \u201cThere are some very complex discussions we need to have. We know exactly what the universities have been asking for and will continue to have those discussions,\u201d Sturgeon added. Universities Scotland, which represents the sector, said a 50% drop in international students would cost its members \u00a3435m in 2020-21. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said while only one in five students on British campuses were from overseas, their fees amounted to nearly a third of all tuition income and close to \u00a37bn in total. \u201cAttempts by universities to make up for this loss by increasing their numbers of domestic students could lead to a desperate scramble, concentrating the income loss on lower ranked universities which would face severe difficulties in recruiting students,\u201d said Laura van der Erve, an IFS research economist. The loss of international students would be more severe on Scottish universities, which rely heavily on their fees to compensate for the lower funding they receive compared with their counterparts in England. The University of St Andrews revealed it had already lost \u00a325m from coronavirus disruption, with its principal describing it as \u201cas serious a financial crisis as our university has faced in modern times\u201d. One senior Scottish university executive said it was clear that overseas students were already delaying their start dates or were no longer sure they would study in the UK. This needed urgent attention and significant Treasury funding. The crisis could eventually lead to universities being merged or shut down. \u201cThe scale of the shock is mind-blowing,\u201d the executive said. \u201cSome institutions are modelling between a 50% and 100% drop in international students. That is not scaremongering.\u201d The University of Aberdeen warned staff this week that its finances were \u201cnow under very serious pressure\u201d. It had hoped to earn \u00a350m from overseas students this year, 20% of its overall income, but that \u201cis now likely to fall substantially, because of the restrictions and uncertainty created by coronavirus\u201d. George Boyne, Aberdeen\u2019s principal, told staff: \u201cAlready we are seeing evidence globally of international applicants wishing to defer their studies by a year, and some being unsure whether they wish to study abroad at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
