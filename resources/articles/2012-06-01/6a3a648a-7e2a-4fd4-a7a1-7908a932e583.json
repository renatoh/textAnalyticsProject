However, he has never won a top-flight domestic league championship with any club for which he has played. This seems like it could possibly be a unique, or at least very unusual feat. Are there any other similar tales of success with club and country in which the humble league title is absent?\" Well, Jesse, Euro 2012 hasn't even started yet, so a titleless Steven Gerrard hasn't yet had time to win that for England, adding it to the FA Cups, Uefa Cup, League Cups and Champions League he has won for Liverpool. Ahem. Let's start that one again, shall we? There are actually more than you'd think, and to start us off, you don't have to look any further than Torres's Chelsea and Spain team-mate Juan Mata. The Chelsea winger, of course, won the Champions League and FA Cup alongside Torres last season, and was also a part of the Spain squad at the 2010 World Cup. He also won the European Under-21 Championship with Spain last summer, and at his previous club, Valencia, he won the Copa del Rey in 2008 \u2013 but no league title. However Mata was not yet a part of the Spain squad when they won Euro 2008 \u2013 unlike Cesc F\u00e1bregas, who started the final and two years later came on to set up Andr\u00e9s Iniesta's winner against Holland in the World Cup final. F\u00e1bregas hasn't had quite as much success as Mata at club level, famously only winning an FA Cup during his time at Arsenal, before winning four trophies for Barcelona last season. However they finished second to Real Madrid in La Liga, and were knocked out of the Champions League by Torres and Mata's Chelsea. Going back further, attention turns to the France teams that won the 1998 World Cup and 2000. Most of their squad dominated at club level as well \u2013 Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and many more \u2013 but there are a couple of notable exceptions. Frank Leboeuf, who of course started the 1998 final in place of the suspended Laurent Blanc, won two FA Cups, one League Cup, the European Cup Winners' Cup and the Super Cup at Chelsea, but never finished higher than third in the league. That said, he did win a league title in 2004 \u2013 the Qatar National First Division with Al-Sadd Sports Club. So the point stands. The second Frenchman is Youri Djorkaeff, who started the 1998 and 2000 finals. He won the French Cup at Monaco in 1991, the Cup Winners' Cup with Paris Saint-Germain in 1996 and the Uefa Cup with Internazionale in 1998. But no league title. Not even with Bolton Wanderers. Like France and Spain, West Germany won the World Cup and the Euros back to back in the 70s. Again, as you'd expect, most of the players who featured in both squads won the league at least once, but one man who stands out is the midfielder J\u00fcrgen Grabowski; a member of both the 1972 and 1974 squads, he twice won the German Cup with Eintracht Frankfurt, before winning the Uefa Cup with them in 1980.

MICHAEL OWEN: RECORD BREAKER? \"Whilst ruminating about the career of Owen Hargreaves (don't ask) I discovered that he'd racked up 42 full England caps, despite only playing 173 club games throughout his career (that's excluding his 15 appearances for Bayern Munich's second side),\" began Mike Dunn last week. \"It means that 19.5% of his appearances were in internationals. Given Hargreaves's lack of action since moving from Germany, I thought that this must be a record. But it isn't. Michael Owen has played a higher proportion of international games versus total appearances with 90 full caps to 354 competitive club appearances. That's 20%! I couldn't find anyone else remotely near that percentage, so does little Mickey Owen hold the record?\" Unfortunately this isn't Owen's year, as a deluge of emails from our readers show. He's even beaten by Dennis Rommedahl who, as shown by Niels Soby Lovendahl, has made 409 club appearances and 116 international appearances for Denmark \u2013 that's a record of 22%. Meanwhile Ben Clark writes in from Australia: \"David Carney is famous as something of a fraudster. Despite picking up only 104 club appearances in his career (most of which have come off the bench), he's got 39 caps for the senior Australian national team as left back \u2013 something of a problem position for the Socceroos, as you could probably tell. A percentage of 37.5% \u2013 dwarfing Mickey Owen.\" Meanwhile Taylor Rockwell emails in with tales from America. \"This may be a bit unfair, but essentially every player that played for the United States from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s has an insane amount of international caps\" he says. \"This is because most of the players didn't play outside the US, and there wasn't any sort of established league. So, essentially, the players just played and trained for the National Team. I believe Alexi Lalas played something like 47 friendlies in a year. \"But (from my calculations) the winner would be Eric Wynalda, who notched 220 club appearances and 107 national team caps. That means that just under 33% of his total appearances came from internationals. May not be the world record, but it's up there in terms of the US.\" Paul Fenton has some names up his sleeve as well. \"Basically anyone who was a regular for their country but spent lots of time on the bench for their clubs will have higher ratio,\" he says. \"I picked a few examples from the list of most capped players... Geremi (26.4%), Ali Daei (30.4%), Cobi Jones (33%), Sami Al-Jaber (34.5%).\" But, thanks to his career being very much at the fledgling stage, there's only one winner. Over to Michael Pilcher. \"22-year-old Fulham third/fourth-choice keeper Neil Etheridge has made one solitary appearance for the club, in a Uefa Cup game against Odense BK in December 2011; he also had a loan stint at Charlton but without making an appearance,\" he says. \"He has however appeared 33 times for the Philippines, meaning 97% of his appearances have been in internationals.\" DEADLIEST GROUP OF DEATH (2) Last week's archive piece from 2007 focused on what have been the hardest groups at international tournaments and came to the conclusion that the Euro 96 group of Germany, Russia, Italy and the Czech Republic was the most daunting of all. However Peter Gregersen has emailed in to point out that record will be broken at Euro 2012. \"You describe the deadliest group of all time with an average Fifa ranking of 5.5,\" says Peter. \"May I then point you towards the upcoming Euros where the Group of Death tops that. With Germany being 2, Netherlands 4, Portugal 5 and Denmark 10, the average is 4.75.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"David Healy and Eduardo da Silva were the two highest scorers in qualifying, but neither made it to Euro 2008,\" wrote Adam Mills in 2008. \"Has this ever happened before?\" More often than you'd think, Adam. In fact, in the last six tournaments it has happened four times. In 2004 Slovenia's Ermin Siljak banged in nine goals in qualifying \u2014 more than any other player \u2014 but the Slovenians lost out to Croatia in the play-offs. In 1992, Darko Pancev scored 10 times as Yugoslavia romped through Group Four. His country, though, were booted out of the finals because of UN sanctions and the onrushing war in the Balkans. In 1988 the Spurs' striker Nico Claesen topped the scoring charts with seven goals for Belgium, but they finished behind the Republic of Ireland (and Bulgaria) in their qualifying group. A respectful nod should also go to Tony Polster, who scored 11 times as Austria failed to qualify for Euro 96. Davor Suker top-scored with 12.
