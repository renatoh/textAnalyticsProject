The quintet, completed in 1875, was the work in which he defined his mature musical language, while three years later the sextet was his first to be couched in a recognisably Czech style, and also his first to attract international attention. The quintet is the more densely scored of the two pieces; it's the more thematically rigorous too and clearly indebted to Brahms, but it remains strangely impersonal. By contrast the central pair of movements in the Sextet are unmistakable Dvorak, while in that work's leisurely opening Allegro, Schubert's influence seems the most important; there's even a repeated quotation from his C major String Quintet. Both Nash performances are expert, clear-textured if not as warm-toned as they could be, and inevitably without the instinctive rhythmic elan Czech musicians bring to this music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
