Absent players, ever-improving opposition, alien conditions, crowds wishing them the worst, the suffocating \u2013 if superb, and inescapable \u2013 security detail and some overemotional aggro all popped up at one stage or another. England\u2019s greenhorns passed their test, however. The captain, Jos Buttler, said immediately after the ODI series victory: \u201cWhat we have achieved here should not be underestimated.\u201d He was right \u2013 Bangladesh is no longer a tour to be sneered at or for top players to rest up on beaches. It should also not be underestimated the mental barrier these players \u2013 some on their first full tour, many in Bangladesh for the first time \u2013 had to cross to play the series in the first place. Let alone 20-somethings, as the assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, put it: \u201cFor some of us who have been around for a while it\u2019s still been quite an interesting, daunting trip.\u201d For that reason, Farbrace said of Buttler, who has looked at home, both as a statesman and a tactician: \u201cI don\u2019t think you could get a tougher series to start off with as captain.\u201d On the field, Buttler, despite his skirmish in Mirpur, has been impressive; his fields have been imaginative and his deployment of his spinners, particularly Adil Rashid, smart. His batting has developed a new gear, too, seen best in the defeat in the second ODI: the risk-averse accumulator still ruthlessly zipping along at a run a ball. Each time he was at the crease his team looked in utter control, which goes some way to explaining the glee with which Bangladesh celebrated his wicket in Mirpur. However, as Farbrace said: \u201cThe cricket challenge is only one side.\u201d Buttler has dealt with increased media duties and the tough gig of selector (and bearer of bad news), too. He spoke about struggling to harness the emotional side of his role and by Chittagong he seemed to have done just that, although he and Sam Billings \u2013 the two worst watchers \u2013 were said to be pacing the room, rifling through their kitbags as the decider headed for the wire. The idea that Buttler is a softie has been dispelled for good. Buttler\u2019s sidekick Ben Stokes has never been accused of softness but he was another to revel in his new role, as Farbrace neatly summed up: \u201cVice-captain or not, he is a leader and wherever he goes, people want to go with him, where he\u2019s going out for dinner, when he\u2019s practising.\u201d Stokes\u2019 two most mature white-ball innings came in England\u2019s two wins, while he could perhaps have bowled more. In the second game in Mirpur, England\u2019s leaders were drawn into a pointless ruckus; as much as Buttler and Stokes looked petty in failing to rise above provocation, the direction of the sanctions dished out by the match referee was instructive, as was Tamim Iqbal seeking out Jason Roy at the end of the series to apologise for what he had said. The heat had told but by Chittagong England had allowed the brouhaha to pass and their heads were screwed back on. A series win \u2013 but hardly a romp \u2013 allowed Farbrace to reflect that, despite the management\u2019s initial anger, it was \u201cprobably even a good thing that some didn\u2019t come\u201d. Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales will be back in India, and so will Joe Root. Ben Duckett and Billings, so impressive here and surely now ahead of Jonny Bairstow and James Vince, will likely have to wait for their chance once more.Long-created pecking orders are not smashed in 2-1 series wins, especially when the powers that be gave the absentees the right to withdraw. Change will not come now but the message from Farbrace was that no one is untouchable and this series reinforced the depth at England\u2019s disposal, especially among batters, but Jake Ball\u2019s rise was encouraging, too. \u201cEvery player in the squad knows that there is serious quality,\u201d said Farbrace, with surely half an eye on Morgan. If form does catch up on him, or any of the other batsmen, England know they are well placed. Every player, in and out of the XI, is slightly more on his toes. Even if it has muddied the selection waters, England will leave Bangladesh knowing plenty more about their roguish band of tyros. The abiding sense that each tourist took plenty from it \u2013 be that the long hours bonding over matches of Fifa on a games console, to the experience on unfamiliar tracks in hostile (in every sense) climes, to the accelerated development of being thrust into a leadership role \u2013 was backed up by Farbrace, who said: \u201cFor a lot of young blokes it\u2019s been a good learning experience. So many people go away from here better for it \u2013 and we have another win, which is what we were here for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
