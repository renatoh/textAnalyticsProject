Here\u2019s our report from Imola: Lewis Hamilton on his latest victory and Mercedes\u2019 title: \u201cIt was an exhausting race with the speed we were having to go \u2013 and I had a poor start. It\u2019s overwhelming right now because I look at my crew here, everyone back at the factory \u2026 they\u2019re the unsung heroes who have grafted away, who continue to push, to elevate and innovate. \u201cPeople watch it and think we\u2019re used to this but it always feels like a first with this team. I\u2019m forever grateful to be a part of it. We\u2019ve got a great leader. To come back year on year, it\u2019s not easy, to deliver weekend in, weekend out. Seven times champs \u2013 that\u2019s something I\u2019ll be able to tell my grandchildren!\u201d Daniel Ricciardo speaks from the podium: \u201cIt was a bizarre one. I got into fourth from the start and thought that was the best we could do, with the three in front. Perez had really good pace, he passed us thorough the pit sequence, and then it all happened with the safety car at the end. I\u2019m not sure what happened to Max, but that put us in the fight. It\u2019s difficult for overtaking here but the circuit itself was awesome.\u201d Valtteri Bottas: \u201cThe start was good, that was the main thing to get right. On lap two there was debris \u2013 I saw it but couldn\u2019t avoid it. I tried not to run it over with the tyres but it caused damage, which made it tricky to drive. I was really pushing hard to avoid Max getting through.\u201d 1 Hamilton 2 Bottas 3 Ricciardo 4 Kvyat 5 Leclerc 6 Perez 7 Norris 8 Sainz 9 Raikkonen 10 Giovinazzi 11 Latifi 12 Vettel 13 Stroll 14 Grosjean 15 Albon Did not finish: - Russell, Verstappen, Magnussen, Ocon, Gasly Valtteri Bottas was second in another one-two finish for Merc, and Daniel Ricciardo third for Renault. He\u2019s delighted: \u201cHoly mac and cheese balls. Another podium!\u201d And with the fastest lap \u2013 he finishes in style \u2013 and that makes Mercedes the 2020 constructors\u2019 world champions! Toto Wolff and his team embrace. Lap 61/63: Hamilton is 1.8sec ahead of Bottas in the lead, Ricciardo is on course for third with Kvyat in DRS range. Leclerc and Perez are locking horns for fifth. Lap 60/63: Hamilton roars through with another fastest lap. Albon was left spinning when Kvyat went past him \u2013 and the Russian saw off Leclerc too. Lap 59/63: Kvyas closes in on Ricciardo for a podium finish \u2013 a hair\u2019s breadth between the two. What a spectacular restart by the Russian. Lap 58/63: We\u2019re back \u2013 Perez goes to overtake Albon but Kvyas gets ahead of them both! Brilliant! Lap 56/63. We\u2019re still under the safety car. The Williams driver tries to warm his tyres up behind the safety car, but his wheels spin and he goes into the barriers. Dreadful error! \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d he says. That could have been his first F1 championship point! Lap 52/63: Botas and Perez are among those to pit after Verstappen\u2019s exit. Top 10: Hamilton, Bottas, Ricciardo, Leclerc, Albon, Norris, Perez, Kvyat, Sainz, Raikkonen From nothing, Verstappen is in the gravel! After such a great race, after doing so well to reel in Bottas, his right rear tyre fails and he\u2019s ended up pointing the wrong way at the chicane. And we have a safety car. \u201cSomething broke on the car,\u201d Verstappen groans. That\u2019s the one-two finish handed to Mercedes. \u2026but not for long. He retires. Raikkonen finally pits with 13 laps to go. Lap 46/63: \u201cI\u2019m getting a massive headache from all these upshifts,\u201d says Magnussen. \u201cIt is like a kick in the head.\u201d He is asked by his team if he wants to retire but powers on. Lap 44/63: Hamilton leads by 13.5secs. Raikkonen is still yet to pit. Sergio Perez is in net fourth having started in 11th. Lap 42/63: Verstappen is hounding Bottas, the gap half a second as they come up the hill. Bottas locks up again and Verstappen sweeps along the outside and takes second place from the Finn. Bottas bottles it! Top 10: Hamilton, Bottas, Verstappen,Raikkonen (0 stops), Perez, Ricciardo, Leclerc, Albon, Kvyat, Sainz Lap 38/63: Bottas is struggling now \u2013 he locks up again and is told the damage is \u201cpretty significant\u201d. Verstappen is less than a second behind him. As for Vettel, he was doing pretty well until a terrible 13-second pitstop. That allows Russell overtakes him into 12, which will soon become 11th when R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen pits. Lap 36/63: The battle for second has become the one to watch. Verstappen is right on Bottas\u2019 tail and on the attack. Lap 32/63: Bottas is pursuing the leader manfully, 4.5secs behind, but is battling damage to his floor. Hamilton looks all set to win a Grand Prix that has been robbed of excitement by the virtual safety car. Top 10: Hamilton, Bottas, Verstappen, Vettel (0 stops), Raikkonen (0 stops), Latifi (0 stops), Perez, Ricciardo, Leclerc, Albon. Lap 31/63: Hamilton leads by 4secs, Bottas second and Verstappen third. This is Hamilton\u2019s to lose now: all the chips have fallen in his favour. The virtual safety car was timed almost exactly with his pit stop. Lap 28/63: The Frenchman has a problem and is forced to stop, smoke coming off his Renault. The virtual safety car is deployed, and Hamilton comes in the pits. Leclerc as he takes P9 from Magnussen in a four-way tussle. Lap 27/63: Kevin Magnussen is in eighth despite spinning in lap 1 \u2013 well done that man. Mercedes ask Hamilton to go another 10 laps! He doesn\u2019t complain. Lap 25/63: \u201cWe have damage on the floor, left hand side\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the message to Bottas. He and Verstappen are in a bit of a head-to-head here with Hamilton taking control. \u201cWe\u2019re just being held up here by Bottas,\u201d comes the voice over the Red Bull radio. \u201cIf you have a little more pace we could do with it.\u201d Mercedes tell Hamilton. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he barks. Lap 23/63: Another fastest lap for Hamilton who has clicked into gear out in front. Bottas needs to pick up the pace. Top 10: Hamilton (0 stops), Bottas, Verstappen, Perez (0 stops), Vettel (0 stops), Raikkonen (0 stops), Latifi (0 stops), Magnussen (0 stops), Ricciardo, Leclerc. Lap 22/63: Verstappen pits as Red Bull attempt the undercut! Bottas follows as Mercedes respond but Lewis Hamilton is told he is going to extend his first stint\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m going to pick up the pace, don\u2019t stop me,\u201d says Hamilton, and promptly scores the fastest lap of the race so far. Lap 18/63: Albon and Kvyat collide, the latter clipping the former and front wing scraping rear wheel, but both look to have gotten away with it. Lap 16/63: \u201cEverything you got!\u201d comes the message to Bottas, who must be pitting soon. But not quite yet \u2026 he and Verstappen keep at it. Lap 13/63: \u201cRight front doesn\u2019t feel great,\u201d says Hamilton. Leclerc has ditched his soft tyres for hards. Giovinazzi and Russell have both been in for new tyres in recent laps, Riccardo, Leclerc, Albon and Kvyat follow. Lap 11/63: As it stands: Bottas, Verstappen, Hamilton, Ricciardo, Leclerc, Albon, Kvyat, Sainz, Norris, Perez. The top three are separated by about 3.5secs. Ferrari are trying to undercut Ricciardo, who Albon is told is struggling. Lap 8/63: Hamilton drops back out of DRS range behind Verstappen, Bottas leading by 1.6sec. \u201cWe are quicker in all corners, just not on the straights,\u201d Verstappen is told over the Red Bull team radio. Gasly\u2019s early exit was apparently due to a drop of water pressure in his vehicle. The Frenchman heads into the pits after that mystery power-unit issue is deemed by his team to be terminal. He was fifth. That is gutting for the driver who qualified in real style. Lap 5/63: Sainz zips past McLaren teammate Norris into P9. Stewards are looking at an incident between Magnussen and Vettel. Top 10: Bottas, Verstappen, Hamilton, Ricciardo, Gasly, Leclerc, Albon, Kvyat, Sainz, Norris. Lap 4/63: \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to follow here,\u201d murmurs Hamilton. He\u2019s 1.3sec behind Verstappen, who\u2019s in turn 1.4 behind Bottas. Those front three are some way ahead of the pack. Lap 3/63: Verstappen has made up some precious miliseconds on Bottas, who is still out in front. Lance Stroll has gone off missing a wing after contact with Ocon\u2019s Renault. Pierre Gasly is behind fourth-placed Ricciardo. Giovinazzi has steamed into 14th after starting in P20. Lap 1/63: Bottas gets away nicely and leads. Magnussen spins and drops back. Verstappen ends the first lap in second after a terrific start, Hamilton in third. Less than two seconds between the trio. With the formation lap done, Valtteri Bottas with a slightly worrying early lock-up on the final loop, the cars return to the grid, get set, and put pedal to the metal. Gasly\u2019s panic was over a power unit issue they they are confident is now resolved. And we\u2019re good to go. Something seems the matter with Pierre Gasly\u2019s AlphaTauri. His team have removed panels from the car and are peering at \u2026 well, who knows. Meanwhile, Red Bull \u2013 the only other team in mathematical contention for the constructors\u2019 championship \u2013 would need to outscore their rivals by 34 points today to deny them the trophy. Or to put it another way, Mercedes would only need one of their drivers to finish fourth to guarantee the win. And the second piece of existential pre-race reading sees Lewis Hamilton talk about the prospect of racing for the first time on the circuit where Ayrton Senna lost his life: Andrew Goudie writes in to point out \u201cthat halloween grid is much better than this effort from McClaren\u201d: Faintly existential pre-race reading. First up, longtime buddies Damon Hill and Johnny Herbert open up about putting their lives on the line in the name of sport: What\u2019s eating Sebastian Vettel? An all-time great and winner of four successive titles seven short years ago. Yet today he starts in 14th, behind teammate Leclerc for the 11th time this season. A bizarre fall from grace and one that, at 33, he\u2019ll need to recover from soon or not at all. F1\u2019s social media team have been busy. This is certainly not as bad as it could have been, but I feel there may be room for improvement. Any suggestions? Emilia-Romagna: food heaven Here\u2019s how they qualified: 1 Valtteri Bottas 2 Lewis Hamilton 3 Max Verstappen 4 Pierre Gasly 5 Daniel Ricciardo 6 Alexander Albon 7 Charles Leclerc 8 Daniil Kvyat 9 Lando Norris 10 Carlos Sainz 11 Sergio Perez 12 Esteban Ocon 13 George Russell 14 Sebastian Vettel 15 Lance Stroll 16 Romain Grosjean 17 Kevin Magnussen 18 Kimi Raikkonen 19 Nicholas Latifi 20 Antonio Giovinazzi Mercedes Mercedes Mercedes! A seventh successive constructors\u2019 championship is in sight for Toto Wolff\u2019s super-team, and what better setting to clinch it than the autumnal splendour of Emilia-Romagna? It\u2019s one of the more glorious parts of the world and though Lewis Hamilton and pals won\u2019t have been indulging in the ragu, mortadella and lambrusco the region is rightly famed for, they may well treat themselves to a glass of the good stuff this evening should things go their way. They certainly did in qualifying, when Hamilton gave a rare glimpse of his fallibility with a sloppy final lap, seeing him pipped to pole by his teammate Valtteri Bottas. We\u2019re yet to see a race this season without a Mercedes driver in pole. In the drivers\u2019 championship, Hamilton leads Bottas by 77 points with five races remaining, and looks a shoo-in for the title. He can\u2019t claim it at Imola \u2013 the first race here since 2006 \u2013 but another victory would leave him in the position to do so at the next round, in Istanbul. So that\u2019s that, then: Mercedes Mercedes Mercedes, all set for glory, without a care in the world \u2013 right? Or who knows, maybe there\u2019ll be a twist in the road somewhere.
