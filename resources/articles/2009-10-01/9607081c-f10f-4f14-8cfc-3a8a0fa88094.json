The young Norwegian also advanced into the top two in the world rankings, ahead of the reigning world champion, Vishy Anand, and behind only Veselin Topalov, who finished runner-up at Nanjing and lost the game below. Carlsen's recent training from Garry Kasparov, the all-time No1, showed in his more solid opening repertoire. Out were his risky Dragon Sicilians, in was the Scotch 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d4 that helped win one of Kasparov's title matches with Anatoly Karpov. He began with 4.5/5, was soon two points clear, and finished yesterday with 8/10. It is Karpov rather than Kasparov whose style Carlsen usually prefers, a strategic and subtle approach that is highlighted here by White's opening play where his Q-side castling and K-side pawn advances are designed to limit Black's options rather than attack the black king. 17 Bb5! is a pure Karpovian idea, exchanging Black's active light-squared bishop, and it provokes the dubious 21...Na8, a pawn sacrifice for activity which misfires. After 31 hxg6 hxg6 32 Rxg6+! Kxg6 33 Qg3+ and 34 Qxf2 is winning. Near the end Carlsen missed 37 Qh3! Nd2+ 38 Ka1 Rh8 39 Qxh8+! when Rh1-h7xd7 wins a rook \u2013 but it was still an impressive performance.
