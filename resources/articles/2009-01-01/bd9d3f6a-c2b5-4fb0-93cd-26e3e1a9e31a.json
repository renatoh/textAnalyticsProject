Somewhere Towards The End, in which she contemplates the pros and cons of advanced age, was one of five category winners on a good night for seasoned contenders. The other winners were Irish writer Sebastian Barry who won the best novel prize with The Secret Scripture; Michelle Magorian - whose first novel Goodnight Mister Tom won awards nearly 30 years ago - who won the children's book award with Just Henry; Sadie Jones, who won best first novel with The Outcast and Adam Foulds, who won the poetry prize for The Broken Word. All five will now compete for the overall book of the year to be announced on January 27. The judges called Athill's book \"a perfect memoir of old age \u2013 candid, detailed, charming, totally lacking in self-pity or sentimentality and above all, beautifully, beautifully written\". Through 16 essays, Athill, who helped set up the publisher Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, contemplates subjects from gardening to sex to death. In an interview in today's Guardian Athill admitted she was hoping to win \"because I'm always terribly broke, and how wonderful it would be to get that lovely cheque.\" The 53-year-old novelist Barry has been something of a literary prize bridesmaid over recent years and was shortlisted for the Booker last year and in 2005. He lost out both times. \"Shortlists have their own magic but this is a pure and simple pleasure,\" he said. \"It's like being 10 again and hearing some good news from a grown-up.\" William Hill have now installed Barry as 2/1 favourite for the overall prize - \"God bless them,\" he said. \"My dear old grandfather lost four fortunes backing favourites.\" Jones is next at 5/2 followed by Athill, 4/1 and Foulds at 9/2. The outsider is Magorian at 5/1. Just Henry, her first new book in 10 years, tells the story a young boy who escapes the bleakness of his life in gloomy post-war Britain through his passion for cinema. The judges called her a \"master storyteller\" adding: \"Just Henry is a soaring, uplifting warm bath of a book \u2013 a wonderful roller-coaster of a story which we all absolutely loved.\" Magorian, still best known for her debut novel Goodnight Mister Tom which was adapted for TV and starred John Thaw, said that home educating her two sons had meant she'd had less time to write novels. \"It's amazing to win. You have no idea if anyone is going to like the book you've written.\" For a debut novel, The Outcast has been a phenomenal success. It was part of the Richard and Judy Summer Read, serialised by Radio 4's Book at Bedtime and shortlisted for last year's Orange Prize. Jones said she was \"really, really pleased. The book has had so much luck, I'm having all my jam at once.\" At 41, Jones is a late debutant. \"I've been writing screenplays for a long time but I didn't think I had a book in me to be honest. It's taken me a long time to know how to do it. I do love writing and I'm not happy if I'm not doing it.\" The youngest winner yesterday was 34-year-old Foulds who won the poetry award. The Broken Word shines a light into a period Foulds believes Britain would rather keep secret, the Mau Mau uprisings in 1950s Kenya. The judges adored it saying: \"It is a rare achievement to write a poetry book that the reader simply can't put down. Readers of poetry and fiction alike will be swept along by its chilling narrative.\" Foulds's award follows praise and prizes for his first novel, The Truth About These Strange Times, which came out in 2007. He said of yesterday's announcement: \"It is hugely pleasing. It was a very intense writing experience for me and it's great to feel that it resulted in something like this. I hadn't really written poetry for a while but the subject matter drove me towards writing it as a poem.\" All of the winners pick up \u00a35,000 as well as the extra sales generated by being a Costa winner, or Whitbread winner as some still prefer (The coffee shop chain took over sponsorship from the brewer in 2006). A panel of judges chaired by Matthew Parris will now decide the overall winner of a prize won last year by AL Kennedy for Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
