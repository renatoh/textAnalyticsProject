Nonetheless, there are still some little nuggets coming out, and this morning we had the cross-examination of Gavyn Davies, the chairman of the BBC. \"What the government's QC, Jonathan Sumption, was attempting to do was imply that the BBC had played fast and loose with the truth, that they were so determined to face down the government on this one that they really didn't mind about the mistakes that Andrew Gilligan may or may not have made in his coverage. Mr Sumption painted a picture of an organisation very full of itself, very set in its absolute conviction that it was right and that the government was entirely wrong. And some very, very tough questioning ensued in which Mr Davies held his ground very strongly. 'That is absolutely not the position, Mr Sumption,' he said. 'Let me explain something to you' - he was a great user of sarcasm, as if explaining the whole thing to a not very clever child. At one point he even said: 'I've never heard such nonsense.' \"Mr Sumption accused the BBC of watering down its statements in order to protect its executives. He accused them of protecting Gilligan even though they were well aware that he had made certain mistakes. The point that Mr Davies came back to constantly was this: 'Look, Gilligan was right. I didn't know, when we had the crucial board meeting of governors at which we decided to stand our ground against the government, who the source was, but the people who did assured me that it was a good sound source, and everything that I have heard from this inquiry tells me that my decision was absolutely right.' \"So Mr Davies, in effect, said: 'Look, we concede there were minor mistakes but overall we took the right decisions, we were right to stand by our man, the story was true and it would have been quite wrong of us not to reveal it. The BBC must be seen to remain independent.' \"It was quite a ferocious stand-off, and I have to say I think that Mr Davies, who appeared to look with great disdain upon the barrister who was cross-examining him, clearly won that round. Whether Lord Hutton will think the same is a different matter.\" BREAKING NEWS The BBC chairman has launched a robust defence of the board of governors' decision to back Andrew Gilligan despite concerns over his dossier report. Full story David Kelly learned the MoD had confirmed his name to the press in a phone call from his line manager which lasted just 46 seconds. Full story David Kelly believed his mother committed suicide, a psychologist has revealed to the Hutton inquiry. Full story Updates from the Lib Dem conference in Brighton Full story LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Congratulations to Neil Austin, the winner of last week's competition. The Conservatives will be \"Celebrating Success\" at 6.30pm on the Tuesday of their conference. \"They've got the room booked 'til eight - more to give the less mobile delegates plenty of time to get in and out than to maximise celebration time, I assume,\" Neil adds, in a frankly unnecessary jibe. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week, the Backbencher has a copy of Richard Heller's High Impact Speeches: How to Create and Deliver Words That Move Minds to give away, courtesy of Prentice Hall. It's a thoroughly enthralling book which she has enjoyed enormously, and invaluable for anyone preparing a conference speech. \"Humour in a speech should be like an expensive hairpiece, and no one should see the join,\" writes Heller, warning: \"Be prepared for humour to fail.\" For a chance of winning it, remind the Backbencher of the title of Tony Blair's speech at last year's conference in Blackpool. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. RED KENNEDY RUMOURS SCOTCHED Maybe the post-Brent East euphoria was to blame. But if any readers had spotted the Lib Dem leader imbibing an orange juice at a party function, or turning down the offer of a post-prandial dram, you certainly weren't going to tell us about it. Indeed, one reader wrote in to condemn our appeal for evidence of Charlie's sobriety as a \"really bad and tasteless idea ... Either he's an alcoholic, in which case it's insensitive, or he's not, in which case it's a slur.\" A slur? All the Backbencher wanted to do was prove that Mr Kennedy is still sitting plumb on the wagon. Nonetheless, in the light of the Sun's appalling two-page feature yesterday - in which Charlie's head appeared as though pickled in a whisky bottle - she has decided to scotch these rumours entirely. As for the tabloid's ludicrous allegations that the boy from Ross, Skye and Inverness West would \"SELL Britain out to Brussels, DESTROY the fabric of society and WRECK industry\" - well, it barely merits a riposte. The only thing missing from this year's Lib Dem conference is any mention of PR. And no - she doesn't mean public relations. HOW TO GET ELECTED Arkansas NBC (\"Coverage You Can Count On\") was in polemical mood last week. \"Carl Miner of Blytheville has gotten a very important lesson on why voters should go to the polls,\" it admonished readers. \"Miner was on Tuesday's ballot, unopposed for a school board seat in south Mississippi County. No one voted for him - and the candidate didn't even cast a ballot for himself.\" Common oversight, surely? \"Miner says he tried to vote but the polling place near his zone was closed,\" reports the channel, adding perspicaciously: \"He says he thinks he gets the seat because no one else was on the ballot.\" It was the first time in Mississippi County that a whole precinct had failed to vote. Now that's what the Backbencher calls post-democracy. WHEN TWO GLASS BOXES GO TO WAR Day four of the Lib Dem conference, and the oratorical strain is beginning to show. \"This last Sunday I was at Tower Bridge,\" revealed mayoral hopeful Simon Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey). \"Like many others I looked briefly at the illusionist David Blaine in his glass box. Next to him is City Hall. The sad truth, friends, is that much of Ken Livingstone's first term gives the impression of success, but much of this is an illusion.\" Striking analogy - but what no doubt particularly annoyed Simon was the sight of Ken's employees handing out \"Totally LondOn\" balloons to the gawping masses. Ken initially complained about Blaine's stunt, saying it was offensive to the relatives of IRA hunger strikers. But the Backbencher wonders whether he wasn't rather annoyed that his own street entertainments - see the front pages of Ken's dire propaganda sheet, The Londoner, for examples - are proving less popular than a Yank swigging bottled water in a box and waving regally to the crowd. A METEORIC RISE A reader draws the Backbencher's attention to last Saturday's Abergavenny Celebrity Ready Steady Cook. \"This year's guests are two of Westminster's brightest stars, Chris Bryant, Labour MP for Rhondda, and Lembit Opik...\" MAKING A RACKET Michael Jabez Foster (Labour, Hastings and Rye) emails his fellow MPs and peers with a very on-message offer. \"Inexpensive. Social. Cross-class. Clean, drug-free image. Socially inclusive irrespective of gender, race or culture, disability or [word omitted for the benefit of email filters] ... With all this and more in its favour we have to ask - 'Why isn't there an all-party group already?' and more importantly [sic] 'Why aren't you a member?' The Backbencher racked her brains for a pastime so many MPs could enjoy together. Bowls? Lembit Opik-baiting? \"Don't miss the opportunity to be involved in the promotion of Table Tennis in the UK!\" PARTY OF SPIN ... ER ... Smith Square did an exemplary job after Uma Fernandes' defeat last week. \"Conservative vote holds up in Brent East,\" ran the headline on Conservatives.com, stuffing the news that her share of the vote fell by more than 2% to 16%. \"Tide of protest causes Labour's first byelection defeat for 15 years.\" WMD FOUND SAFE AND WELL Thanks to all those - including Peter himself - who emailed the Backbencher with news of Britain's foremost neo-con blogger, missing since early this month. \"Dear Backbencher,\" writes Darlington's answer to Stephen Pollard, \"I'm afraid none of the exotic reasons you came up with are true. The site is down because my server's host has been down the last two weeks, and he is slow in getting it back up. I am told things will be restored soon, and I'll let you know when they are.\" The young man is too modest to say so, but other sources tell the Backbencher that he has retreated here - where he has been reflecting, at length, on the lessons of An Evening with Ann Widdecombe. SCHMOOZE WATCH The Backbencher will be in Bournemouth next week - and even if you don't see her, you may come across one of her new calling cards. She will be publishing a special Labour conference edition on Wednesday and, as ever, you can reach her at backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. Those readers who possess smart new camera phones are invited to send in your conference snaps - and sightings of Gordon Brown in sympathetic company are particularly welcome. HANSARD TOO HOT TO HANDLE Apologies to those Westminster subscribers who did not receive their Backbencher last week. She foolishly quoted a particularly racy passage from Lords Hansard (September 16, 8.10pm, the Earl of Onslow) which, she now realises, was unfit for MPs' consumption. ATLANTIC DRIFT \"Look here, old fruit,\" writes one Josh Lanolin. \"I don't mind the odd typo in your pieces, but I do object to your use of crap (ersatz?) American words when there are well-established British ones. Please use 'forthcoming' instead of the ghastly 'upcoming' in future.\" Let's not take this to the reader's editor, Josh. We'll oblige. FORTHCOMING EVENTS * The Hansard Society is holding a fringe meeting in the Forestdale Suite of the Wessex Hotel, Bournemouth, on September 30 at 6pm. Theme: My View, My Voice, My Vote - Being Heard Between Elections. Participants include John Denham, Gwyneth Dunwoody, Eric Joyce, Meg Munn and Martin Bell. Hansard Society * \"Fancy telling Tessa Jowell and stakeholder organisations like the British Olympic Association, VisitBritain and VisitLondon what you think of holding the Olympics here in 2012?\" asks VB's government affairs officer. \"You'll have the opportunity at their Labour conference fringe meeting - 'London's 2012 Olympic Bid - Why We're Gonna Win!' before Tony's speech at 1pm on Tuesday September 30 in the Mirabelle Suite of the Royal Bath Hotel in Bournemouth.\" It's a pleasure, Craig. * The Fabians are hosting numerous events at Bournemouth, of which the most interesting might prove to be at 6pm on Wednesday at the Wessex hotel: \"Labour's love lost: What does the party believe in now?\" John \"Gissanotherjob\" Reid, Beatrix Campbell and Michael Jacobs, the departing general secretary of the Fabians, debate. Fabian Society ON TV AND RADIO THIS WEEK Tonight, 9pm, BBC1: Crimewatch UK Will Nick Ross be the first victim of the BBC's post-Hutton shake-up? Can you help solve the mystery of why a programme dedicated to portraying Britain as a violent society is given prime airtime on the BBC? If so, email Charles Moore at the Telegraph, explaining how you reconcile an anti-BBC stance with a critique of New Labour's news management. Thursday, 9.30am, R4: Headstrong and Proud Michael Crick meets the woman-friendly Primrose League, named after Disraeli's favourite flower, which still gathers regularly in St John's Wood. Thursday, 10.35pm, BBC1: Question Time It's back! No word on the participants. Sunday, 9am, R4: Broadcasting House The Backbencher is, quite simply, inconsolable. Who could ever replace Eddie? Sunday, 10.45pm: The Westminster Hour Great Byelections The Lib Dems Have Known, No 587: Roy Jenkins almost wins Warrington for the SDP in 1981. Preceded by coverage from Bournemouth. FINAL READING No 10's dossier on Iraq's WMDs was published a year ago today. You can still read it on GU Politics. In pictures: GI Charlie greets the Lib Dem conference. The Guardian's senior political columnist Hugo Young died on Monday. His obituary, and tributes to his work, appear here. Don't underestimate the significance of the Liberal Democrats' win in Brent East, writes David Walter, it may be the start of a shift in British politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
