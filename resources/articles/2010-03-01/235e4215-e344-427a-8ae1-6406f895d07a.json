So you need to make a decision which is based not only for the team but for my own career as well. In football, managers get annoyed when players get injured and it stops them playing for their countries, and it's one of those things. You have to weigh up what's best for your career.\" That was as far as Murray was prepared to go on that dicey subject. He had already been asked to comment on the dire state of British tennis being discussed in the houses of parliament, and that had required more than enough thinking on his feet for him to risk much more trouble. \"I haven't spoken to anyone about that,\" he began, fencing for time. \"It's a difficult one. On the men's side things have not been going well, you can say, in terms of results and the level. But it's way better than it has been in a few years. And the women's side could be better. The men's side needs to get way way better with the amount of money invested and we as a nation deserve to get better results.\" Murray would much rather have been focusing on what he needs to do over the next 10 days during which he is at risk of losing a very large number of ranking points if he does not do well. He had, he said, had a lengthy talk with Miles MacLagan, his coach, about the significance of last week's disappointing loss to Robin Soderling in Indian Wells and it will be intriguing to see whether there is an attempt to revert to the attacking emphasis he showed while losing in the second round in Dubai last month. Briefly better news was that for the first time since 1991 there were three British women in the main draw here \u2013 Elena Baltacha, who qualified after reaching a career-high 65 last week, Anne Keothavong, the former British No1 who got in with a protected ranking after last year's six-month injury break, and Heather Watson, the 17-year-old US Open junior champion, who received a wild card. Unfortunately two of them did not last long. Keothavong missed a decent chance of scoring only her sixth win this year when she took a 4-2 lead against Tamira Paszek before losing her momentum, her confidence and the match 6-4, 6-2 to the former top-40 Austrian. \"My grandmother passed away yesterday and I wasn't really there in the head today. I tried to fight my emotions but tennis didn't seem that important today,\" Keothavong said. It seemed as though lack of belief and ensuing loss of rhythm with her more attacking ground strokes which did for Keothavong, who had been absent from the main tour for seven months with a knee injury. Watson's steadiness and intelligence in her first major event on the main tour only resulted in a defeat by an identical score to Tsvetana Pironkova, a former top-40 Bulgarian currently ranked outside the top 100."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
