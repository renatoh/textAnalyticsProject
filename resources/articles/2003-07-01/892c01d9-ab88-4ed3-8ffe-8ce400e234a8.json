As revealed earlier this year by MediaGuardian.co.uk, US company Roxio plans to relaunch Napster as a paid-for download service along the lines of Apple's successful iTunes, which allows Apple users to download a wide variety of tracks for 99 cents each. Roxio, which manufacturers CD copying software, bought the rights to the Napster name last November and has since then been negotiating with major record labels in an effort to sign up a sizeable portion of their catalogues. Before the success of iTunes, which notched up five million downloads in its first two months of operation, legitimate download services had been criticised for their high monthly subscriptions, poor selection of tracks and lack of versatility in transferring songs to other devices and copying them to CD. Roxio, like Buy.com and other companies planning to launch similar services, hopes to avoid repeating these mistakes. \"We're working with the labels to liberalise usage rules and we believe they will be much more liberal than we have had in the past,\" the Roxio chairman, Chris Gorog, told Associated Press. In May Roxio also bought Pressplay, the subscription download service launched by Sony Music and Vivendi Universal. It plans to abandon the Pressplay brand but use the technology as the basis for the new service, which will offer monthly subscription and a la carte options. Mr Gorog added the service would also feature personalised internet radio, artist interviews and exclusive tracks from independent labels. At launch the service will offer about 500,000 songs, he promised. But Napster 2.0, as the reborn service will be called, will face a tough fight from other media giants hoping to grab a slice of the growing legitimate download market. Now Apple has proved consumers are prepared to pay for digital music that is delivered in a user friendly and value for money fashion, giants such as Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo! are scrambling to launch services. Shawn Fanning, the former college student who founded Napster from a laptop in the back room of his uncle's house at the age of 19, has been recruited by Roxio to work as a consultant on the project. More than 80 million computer users were gorging themselves on Napster's huge library of free music at the height of the site's popularity in 2000. It caused panic in the record industry, which was already suffering faltering sales as a result of traditional piracy and increased consumer spending on other leisure products. Napster was closed down in July 2001 after the major music labels won an injunction forcing the site to remove all copyrighted songs from its database. A year later the company closed down altogether after a brief attempt by German media giant Bertelsmann, which invested in the company, to resurrect the site as a paid-for service. The site never got back online and a US judge eventually ruled that Bertelsmann could not buy the bankrupt company's assets because the two businesses were too close. Despite getting rid of Napster, the record companies face an even greater challenge from \"peer to peer\" networks such as Kazaa and Gnutella. Such services are virtually impossible to close down because they simply act as huge worldwide networks, allowing users to transfer songs between their PCs. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
