On Friday the NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, said the two officers had \u201clet the police force down badly\u201d after footage of the incident showed the two officers taunting and belittling the two women. \u201cWe need to maintain the trust of the police within our multicultural communities and, frankly, behaviour like this undermines the good work done by police officers across NSW,\u201d McKay said. \u201cPeople who come to Australia to live do so because they know we are a country of respect and tolerance. Let\u2019s make sure we keep it that way.\u201d The footage was released by the state\u2019s police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, after an investigation into the incident in western Sydney in April. It showed one officer telling the 24-year-old driver she was \u201cthe most stupidest person I\u2019ve met as the driver of a motor vehicle\u201d before threatening to falsely charge her as an accessory to murder. Later, the second officer is heard asking one of the women what her religion is and demanding she \u201cswear to Allah\u201d. In its investigation of the incident the LECC found the two officers had engaged in serious misconduct when they pulled over the 24-year-old and her stepmother. It said the officers had \u201cexhibited racial prejudice\u201d and had used \u201cintimidating and abusive language\u201d while deliberately bullying and frightening the two women. The report was tabled in parliament on Thursday, but the LECC conducted interviews with the two officers involved in July. In August, a submission to the LECC from the NSW police made \u201cno attempt to defend the conduct of either officer\u201d. But on Friday police would not say whether the officers were still on active duty. \u201cThe NSW Police Force acknowledges the recent reports published by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission and will consider all recommendations,\u201d a police spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cA formal response will be provided to the LECC in due course.\u201d Asked specifically whether the two officers were still working and in what capacity, the spokesperson said: \u201cAs the report was only tabled yesterday, and as per our statement, the recommendations are now to be considered at our end.\u201d Labor\u2019s assistant shadow minister for multiculturalism, Jihad Dib, said on Twitter the work of the police had been \u201cundermined by the actions of these particular officers\u201d. \u201cThis was a frightening and humiliating experience for these two women from officers who are entrusted to do better than they did,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
