Sterling returned to training with City on Friday after being sent home from the national team camp on Monday, a calf injury being the reason provided. He had missed the previous day\u2019s match in Belgium and was back in his club\u2019s care by the time England faced Iceland on Wednesday, but is in contention to start when City visit Spurs on Saturday evening. \u201cMourinho has to speak to the doctor for the national team of England and the doctor for Manchester City,\u201d Guardiola said after being informed that Mourinho had predicted Sterling would be passed fit to play and demanded an explanation from Gareth Southgate. Mourinho had drawn a contrast with Eric Dier, who missed two Spurs games after sustaining a hamstring problem during the October international break. He had also requested that Southgate reveal who he was referring to when he said in the week that managers were applying \u201chuge pressure\u201d to reduce players\u2019 national team duties. Guardiola strongly denied any underhand behaviour on City\u2019s part. \u201cHe has to go to the doctors of the national team and Manchester City,\u201d reiterated Guardiola when asked whether City had pushed England to withdraw Sterling. \u201cExcept maybe Mourinho is a doctor, I don\u2019t know. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not going to answer anything about Jos\u00e9. I said the doctor because he accused us of something we have done that is not true. You have to speak to the doctors about these other things, don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m almost 50, I\u2019m old enough to understand \u2026\u201d It is a fresh episode in an age-old feud that had cooled in recent years. \u201cOf course, we all know that Sterling is going to play,\u201d Mourinho had said. \u201cWhen Eric Dier left the national team injured last month, he didn\u2019t play [the next] two matches for Tottenham. He didn\u2019t play the Premier League match and the Europa League match. He needed a couple of weeks to recover, and Raheem is going to play tomorrow. These are the little details that I think Gareth should explain to us all.\u201d Asked how he would feel if the returning Sterling scored the winner against his side, Mourinho said: \u201cI think you have to wait until March and ask that question in March to the person you have to ask.\u201d He was presumably referring to Southgate. Of Southgate\u2019s reference to a \u201cpower game\u201d between England and the competing interests of club managers, Mourinho said: \u201cI would like him to say who. I would like him to say which are the coaches who put pressure on the players not to go, and I would like him to say which are the coaches he calls and speaks on the phone with. Apart from that he has the right, the power, to call the players he wants.\u201d Mourinho also expressed concerns about the safety of international football during Covid-19. His right-back Matt Doherty is self-isolating following a positive test after playing in the Republic of Ireland\u2019s defeat against Wales last weekend. \u201cIt is a bit difficult for me to understand that the player, after a game, on the same night, has a positive result. Why after, why not before? It\u2019s a simple question, probably with a simple answer, but I don\u2019t have the answer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
