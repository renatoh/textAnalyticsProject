The Dow is now up 414 points at 25,235, a strong gain of 1.6%. Hopes of an imminent rate cut are building! Finally, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has ended the day 29 points higher at 7,214. That\u2019s a gain of 0.4%. Jay Powell\u2019s pledge to do what it takes to address the trade war helped shares to close a little higher. Still, morale was also dampened by the steady drip of poor economic news (from weak construction activity in Britain to a downturn in South Africa). Goodnight! GW A deal to restructure Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group may be close.... the retailer is expected to announce he\u2019ll provide more money to address the firm\u2019s pension deficit. More here: David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, agrees that the luke-warm words from China helped markets recover today. He writes: The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the trade spat with the US will need to be worked out with additional talks. In the era of heighted trade tensions, any language that isn\u2019t hostile, and advocates further dialogue, is seen as a step forward. The situation is far from diffused, but the absence of aggression has promoted traders to snap up stocks. The FTSE 100 is lagging behind its Continental counterparts as big oil stocks are holding back the London index. The Italian FTSEMIB is holding up well even though the coalition government in Rome is looking a little shaky. There has been chatter of a possible collapse in administration, but it was reported that the two coalition heads, Matteo Salvini, and Luigi Di Maio had a long and cordial telephone conversation, so that should take the heat off Italian government bonds in the near-term. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker has pledged to take \u201cappropriate\u201d measures to protect the US economy from the impact of trade wars. It may be a hint that US Federal Reserve could cut interest rates soon, as a growing number of investors suspect. Fed chair Jerome Powell is making the comments at a monetary policy conference in Chicago right now. Powell has told attendees that the Fed is \u201cclosely monitoring the implications\u201d the ongoing trade disputes, which helped to drive markets down last month. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or when these issues will be resolved. As always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective.\u201d Powell hasn\u2019t explicitly mentioned an interest rate cut, but these comments look like a central banker\u2019s \u2018eyebrow-waggle\u2019 at the markets. A few months ago, the Fed was expected to raise interest rates several times in 2019 and 2020 -- now, the markets are pricing in cuts to borrowing costs, to prevent the US sliding into recession. Just in: American factory orders have fallen, in (yet another) sign that global manufacturing is weak. Orders shrank by 0.8% in April, new official figures show. March\u2019s data has been revised lower too, to a 1.3% increase (from 1.9% before). Demand for durable goods, such as computers and electronics equipment, dropped. Ding Ding! The New York stock exchange has opened higher, following the turnaround in Europe today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 263 points, or just over 1%, in early trading, as investors grip onto hopes of trade war progress with Beijing and/or Mexico City. Just in: Donald Trump has warned Mexico that he will press on with tariffs on their goods. He told a press conference in London that Mexico needed to do more to prevent migration to the US, saying he \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that Mexico is run by the ... cartels and the coyotes.\u201d Investors are taking comfort from those mollifying comments from China (here) and Mexico (here). European stock markets are all positive, shaking off their earlier losses, on hopes that the trade tensions will ease - before they cause even more damage to the global economy. The oil price is also clawing back some losses, having hit a three-month low this morning. Brent crude is now back around $61 per barrel, from $60.20 earlier. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the oil price is being moved by the latest trade war issues: Against the background of uncertainty over US tariffs on China, Mexico and now possibly India, the market is waiting for new clues before making any decisive trade moves. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard has also talked up the prospects of an agreement with the US. Ebrard is in Washington on a diplomatic mission to prevent America hiking tariffs on Mexican imports, as threatened by Donald Trump late last week. He\u2019s told reporters that his officials will present a new proposal to control immigration from Mexico to the US tomorrow. It may help placate the White House, which wants the flow of migrants curbed. Ebrard told a news conference that talks have already been productive, pledging: \u201cWe\u2019re going to find common ground, I think... We are ready. China\u2019s latest statement on the trade war with America is a classic blend of carrot and stick. On the one hand, the Ministry of Commerce insists that the trade war will only be resolved through fresh talks, saying: \u201cThe Chinese side always believes that the differences and frictions between the two sides in the economic and trade field will ultimately need to be resolved through dialogue and consultation.\u201d But that conciliatory tone is immediately followed by a reminder that Beijing blames Washington for the recent deterioration in relations (which have seen China\u2019s Huawei blacklisted from trading with US firms...) \u201cHowever, consultations are principled and need to be based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit... It is hoped that the US will abandon its wrong practices and work in tandem with the Chinese side. In the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, we will control differences and strengthen cooperation to jointly safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-US economic and trade relations.\u201d Newsflash: China commerce ministry has called for \u201cdialogue and negotiations\u201d to resole the ongoing trade war with the US. Details to follow... Anxiety over global growth prospects, and fears that stock markets will fall, have pushed the gold price to a three-month high today. Gold has gained 4%, or nearly $50 per ounce, this week to nearly $1,320/ounce - its highest level since the end of February. South Africa\u2019s central bank needs to follow Australia\u2019s lead, and cut interest rates fast, argues Jameel Ahmad of curency trading firm FXTM. He says South Africa\u2019s economic contraction shows that the global economy is weakening, partly due to the ongoing global trade war. Policymakers don\u2019t have time to hang around, given the fears over the global economy, he writes: Emerging markets are having to contend with a tornado of different external headwinds, and these including persistent trade tensions that are adding further downside anxieties to economies that are reliant on resilient global demand. South Africa is just one of the many nations that is heavily exposed to the fears of another world recession arising at the turn of the next decade. The problem that is not helping South Africa, or other emerging markets across the world by any means is that the latest Manufacturing PMIs across the world are confirming further contractions. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Russia, Poland, Turkey, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom have all seen Manufacturing PMIs contracting in recent weeks. This is a reliable signal that a coordinated world slowdown is close to arriving, and the GDP reading out of South Africa has reinforced these expectations further. South Africa\u2019s currency, the rand, has fallen sharply since the weak GDP figures were released. More gloom! South Africa\u2019s economy has suffered its worst quarter since the financial crisis. South African GDP shrank at an annual rate of 3.2% in the first three months of 2019, new government data shows. That\u2019s twice as bad as expected (it\u2019s effectively a 0.8% contraction quarter-on-quarter). South Africa\u2019s manufacturing, mining and agricultural sectors all shrank, in a blow to newly re-elected president Cyril Ramaphosa. Agriculture industry contracted by 13%, mining fell 11%, while manufacturing decreased by 8.8% year-on-year. The downturn was partly due to a series of national power cuts, as supplier Eskom Holdings struggled to keep the lights on. That badly hurt business and investor confidence. It\u2019s only six months since South Africa emerged from its last recession - now it risks falling into another one, unless growth picks up this quarter. The latest eurozone inflation data is also flashing a warning light. Consumer price inflation across the currency block fell to 1.2% per year in May, new \u2018flash\u2019 figures from Eurostat show. That\u2019s down from 1.7% in April - so a very substantial decline. Eurostat reports that energy prices rose by 3.8% year-on-year in May, down from 5.3% in April. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation crept up to 1.6% from 1.5%, but services inflation slumped to 1.1%, from 1.9%. Prices of non-energy industrial goods were only up 0.3%, from 0.2% a month ago. Consumers will be pleased, but it will cause serious head-scratching at the European Central Bank. Despite its massive money-printing QE bond-buying programme, inflation is not back at its target of just below 2%. So it\u2019s hard to see how the ECB can raise interest rates anytime soon, as it had once hoped. In better news, eurozone unemployment has dropped to 7.6%, the best since the financial crisis. Today\u2019s UK construction PMI report is surprisingly weak, says Max Jones, relationship director in Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking\u2019s infrastructure and construction team. \u201cThe drop can partly be attributed to a change in focus, with a lot of contractors now placing more emphasis on cashflow rather than revenues. However, many are also feeling the pinch on their working capital, as requirements to pay clients within 30 days become more stringent. Cash will be king in the coming months, and those able to reduce debt while improving cashflow will be in a much stronger position when activity picks up again. Jones adds that some \u201cmegaprojects\u201d are running behind schedule (Crossrail, for example), which is causing anxiety among contractors. It\u2019s only Tuesday morning, and we\u2019ve already had three piece of weak UK economic data, namely: UK construction shrank in May, at the fastest pace in a year (see earlier post) UK manufacturing also contracted last month, at the fastest rate in almost three years (see yesterday\u2019s news story) UK retail sales fell by 2.7% in May, the worst fall since the British Retail Consortium started counting (see this morning\u2019s news story) Tomorrow we discover how the UK service sector fared in May. Economists predict very modest growth (the Services PMI is expected to rise to 50.6, from 50.4 in April). Anything weaker would be another blow. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, also blames the confusion over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU for the construction slowdown. \u201cMay data reveals another setback for the UK construction sector as output and new orders both declined to the greatest extent since the first quarter of 2018. Survey respondents attributed lower workloads to ongoing political and economic uncertainty, which has led to widespread delays with spending decisions and encouraged risk aversion among clients. \u201cCommercial building remained hardest-hit by Brexit uncertainty, with construction firms reporting the steepest fall in this category of activity since September 2017. Civil engineering work also dried up in May and a fourth consecutive monthly fall in activity marked the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013. Construction companies often commented that recent tender opportunities for civil engineering work had been insufficient to replace completed projects. \u201cHouse building was the only sub-category of construction output to buck the downward trend in May, but growth remained softer than on average in 2018. This chart shows how Britain\u2019s construction PMI (which measures activity across the sector) has weakened in recent months: Brexit uncertainty is having a chilling effect on UK builders, says Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Here\u2019s his explanation for why UK construction went into reverse last month: \u201cA fragile dreariness descended on the sector this month with lower workloads leading to the fastest decline in purchasing of construction materials since September 2017. With the continuing uncertainty around Brexit and instabilities in the UK economy, client indecision affected new orders which fell at their fastest since March 2018 and particularly affected commercial activity. \u201cThe previously unshakeable housing sector barely kept its head above water, growing at its weakest level since February as residential building started to lose momentum. The biggest shock however, came in the form of job creation as hesitancy to hire resulted in the largest drop in employment for six and a half years. Not much to be happy about it seems though an easing in some input costs for raw materials offered some relief while energy and fuel prices continued to rise. \u201cThis is unlikely to be nearly enough to turn around the sector\u2019s fortunes, as optimism about the strength of the sector\u2019s future was the lowest since October 2018. Policymakers will need to pull a large rabbit out of the hat, and fast, to improve these difficult conditions and prevent a further entrenchment of gloom and contraction this summer.\u201d Newsflash: Britain\u2019s construction sector has slumped back into a contraction. Activity across UK building firms fell last month, driven by a sharp decline in commercial construction and civil engineering, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s monthly survey of purchasing managers at construction firms also found that new orders fell last month. Builders blamed \u201csubdued domestic economic conditions\u201d, which deterred hesitant clients from committing to new projects. In another blow, business optimism across the sector fell to its weakest since October 2018. Many builders blamed concerns that domestic political and economic uncertainty would dampen business activity growth over the next 12 months. This pulled the UK construction PMI down sharply to 48.6 in May, down from 50.5 in April. That\u2019s below the 50-point level that shows whether activity rose or fell during the month. It\u2019s also the weakest reading since March 2018, when the Beast from the East froze construction output. Markit also found that builders cut jobs at the fastest rate since November 2012. Reaction to follow... Ireland\u2019s factory sector has weakened, mirroring the global slowdown in manufacturing. Activity at Irish manufacturers grew at its slowest rate in nearly three years in May, new figures from data firm Markit shows. Factory bosses reporting that new orders shrank, while the boost from pre-Brexit stockpiling has faded. This pulled Markit\u2019s Irish manufacturing PMI down to 50.4 in May, from 52.5 in April. Here are the key points (more details here). Output posts first fall since UK\u2019s EU referendum New business contracts at fastest pace in six years Purchasing activity declines as firms reduce stockpiling The Woodford debacle could cause significant damage to investor confidence. Will people be as willing to put their money into such funds, if they can suddenly be frozen without warning? Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown, which provides easy access to retail funds (for a fee!), have slumped by 6% this morning - the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. It has been forced to remove the now-frozen Woodford Equity Income from its Wealth 50 list of favourite funds (given recent losses, should it have ever been there?!). Emma Wall, head of Investment Analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says another Woodford vehicle has also been kicked off the Wealth 50 list. \u201cThe suspension follows a period of underperformance and outflows for the Woodford Equity Income Fund. We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford\u2019s multi-decade track record remains compelling \u2013 but we don\u2019t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford\u2019s recent performance. \u201cThe suspension is understandably frustrating, but it\u2019s important to remember that the value of your investment will be dependent on the share prices of the portfolio\u2019s underlying holdings, which are not directly impacted by the suspension. \u201cBecause the fund has been suspended we\u2019ve removed it from our Wealth 50 list of favourite funds. We have also removed the Woodford Income Focus Fund, as we would prefer to see a resolution to the dealing suspension before we conduct a review.\u201d It\u2019s a grim morning for investors who backed one-time top stock picker Neil Woodford. Yesterday, Woodford blocked investors from pulling cash from his flagship fund -- called \u2018equity income\u2019 -- after becoming overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. It\u2019s a major, embarrassing blow to Woodford, once the darling of the City for his ability to invest money wisely. He was forced to freeze equity income redemptions after a series of poor punts, often on medium-sized UK firms (the last straw may have been Kier Group, who issued a profits warning on Monday). Investors have been fleeing in recent weeks, forcing Woodford to take the draconian step of locking them in. Another of his vehicles, Woodford Patient Capital Trust, is traded on the London stock market. Traders have been impatiently ditching the stock, sending its shares slumping by 13% to a record low. Technology stocks are vulnerable to global slowdown worries, and the US-China trade war, so it\u2019s notable how far they\u2019ve fallen recently: European stock markets have also fallen in early trading. Technology stocks are the big fallers, following the FAANG losses on Wall Street overnight, followed by healthcare and consumer goods firms. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 0.3%, while France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.7%. Only Italy is bucking the trend, up 0.25% after prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned his coalition partners to end their bickering. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the prospect of antitrust probes into Google, Facebook et al is worrying traders: Markets remain on the hook to the trade war rumblings, but a new war has opened up that threatens equity investors \u2013 a war on tech. What the Fed threatens to give, the DoJ takes away..... Political pressure is building \u2013 lawmakers sniff votes in tackling big tech. The shift really happened last year with Facebook\u2019s scandals, which broken the illusion of Silicon Valley being in it for the little guy. They\u2019re just big corporations out to make money like any other \u2013 the politicians can smell blood. As I noted a year or two ago, I always thought Trump had the hallmarks of a Teddy Roosevelt trust-buster. Anxiety over the economic outlook hit shares in Asia today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite fell by almost 1%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng has lost 0.65% and India\u2019s Sensex dipped by 0.5%. Investors were particularly jittery after seeing shares in US technology giants slide last night, amid concerns of antitrust investigations into companies such as Alphabet. Overnight, the US Congress announced a new bipartisan investigation into digital markets and the tech industry, looking into giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon for \u201ccompetition problems\u201d and \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d. Slowdown fears have forced Australia\u2019s central bank to slash interest rates to a record low. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut borrowing costs to just 1.25%, warning that household spending is suffering from low income growth and falling housing prices. It\u2019s the latest sign that the world\u2019s central bankers are turning more dovish, and worried that the economic picture is weakening. Here\u2019s our liveblog on the RBA\u2019s decision: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. How healthy is the world economy? Fears of a global slowdown are building, as America\u2019s pugnacious trade policies threaten to derail the long, slow, recovery from the financial crisis. We saw yesterday that factory output in the UK and eurozone is shrinking, while American factories are growing at their slowest pace in a decade. This is now fuelling calls for US central bankers to slash interest rates before the economy suffers a recession. A chorus of Wall Street economists are now predicting a sharp slowdown in America, as the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports reverberates. Morgan Stanley fears the US could slump by early 2020 unless the trade war calms down. Trump\u2019s latest threat - to impose levies on Mexican imports - has intensified concerns. As JP Morgan analysts put it: \u201cThe latest developments this week are likely to have lasting damaging effects on business confidence. Growth concerns are unlikely to dissipate over the near term, and could in fact build further.\u201d After a turbulent May, analysts fears that the stock markets could remain volatile - with the risk of chunky losses in the months ahead. John Higgins of Capital Economics predicts that the US S&amp;P500 could slide by another 17% by the end of the year - on top of the 7% decline in recent weeks. He warned clients: We remain of the view that the bond market is simply running ahead of the stock market. We think that the equities will \u201ccatch up\u201d in due course. Admittedly, we aren\u2019t explicitly forecasting another recession, just a significant economic slowdown. But our end-2019 forecast of 2,300 for the S&amp;P 500 would only leave it 22% or so below its recent peak. This would be a much smaller drop than the declines seen around the two recessions of the 2000s. Coming up today The latest eurozone inflation figures are out this morning, and likely to show that the cost of living slowed last month. Great news for consumers, but a blow to the European Central Bank\u2019s plans - ahead of its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. A new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s builders is likely to show limited growth last month. The UK construction PMI is tipped to inch up to 50.6, from 50.5 in April, barely above stagnation. Overnight, we\u2019ve learned that UK consumer spending fell at the fastest rate in at least 25 years last month - a worrying sign for the economy. Plus, it\u2019s stock market reshuffle day in Britain. Budget airline Easyjet looks likely to be ejected from the FTSE 100 to make room for sports fashion chain JD Sports. But Marks &amp; Spencer, another laggard, might avoid being kicked out, if the powers at FTSE Russell decide to add its ongoing \u00a3600m cash call to its market capitalisation.
