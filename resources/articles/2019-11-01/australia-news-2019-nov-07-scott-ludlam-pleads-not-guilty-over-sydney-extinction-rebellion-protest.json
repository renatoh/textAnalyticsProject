Ludlam had been charged with not complying with police direction regarding a road closure. On Thursday his lawyer Russell Byrnes told registrar Stephen Lister that the former federal senator, as well as six other protesters, would all be pleading not guilty. The case will have its first hearing date on 21 November. Ludlam was not present in court on Thursday. Police have charged Ludlam with breaching section 148B(2) of the Road Transport Act, which has a maximum penalty of a $2,200 fine. Byrnes told Guardian Australia outside court that this was \u201ca very simple charge\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re pleading not guilty, and we hope justice prevails,\u201d he said. Ludlam was initially given strict bail conditions which banned him from coming within 2.5km of the Sydney Town Hall or attending future Extinction Rebellion events. Other protesters arrested were given bail conditions that banned them from \u201cgoing near\u201d or talking to other members of Extinction Rebellion, which civil liberties lawyers said could breach the constitution. In October, Ludlam and other protesters had these bail conditions dismissed by judges. Thirty other protesters, including four teenage girls, were arrested at the same time, as they called on the government to take action on the climate crisis. Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u201cspring rebellion\u201d was a week-long series of protests across Australia \u2013 from road blockages to singalongs. New South Wales police prosecutor, senior sergeant Jamie Palmer, said there were \u201csome 40 people co-accused in these matters\u201d, and it would \u201cneed to run as one hearing\u201d. She told the court that some of the other protesters had already pleaded guilty and been sentenced. In October, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy. \u201cThe people [arrested] are very well aware that if you are disrupting traffic that will invoke a police response. People are not surprised to hear these are arrestable offences. \u201cThe question really is, if the government wants us to stop \u2013 whether that is the school kids or people doing banner drops \u2013 they have a very simple and clear path to do that. \u201cNobody is doing this for fun. We are doing it for a purpose, and that is for the government to snap out of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
