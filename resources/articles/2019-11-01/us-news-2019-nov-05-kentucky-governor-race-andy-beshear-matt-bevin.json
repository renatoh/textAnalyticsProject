The Democratic party prevailed in both the state house and senate in Virginia, a state often viewed as a \u201cbellwether\u201d for national politics and a battleground in presidential elections. Democratic governor Ralph Northam will now have scope to press ahead with legislation such as tighter gun control in the state. \u201cI\u2019m here to officially declare today, November 5 2019, that Virginia is officially blue,\u201d Northam, told a crowd of supporters in Richmond. In Kentucky, which Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in the 2016 election, Andy Beshear \u2013 the Democratic challenger to unpopular incumbent governor Matt Bevin \u2013 declared victory as he was narrowly ahead of the Republican, who has refused to concede in a race that was still too close officially to call on Wednesday morning. \u201cTonight voters in Kentucky sent a message loud and clear for everyone to hear. It\u2019s a message that says our elections don\u2019t have to be about right versus left, they are still about right versus wrong,\u201d Beshear said. The brightest spot for Republicans came was in the Mississippi\u2019s governor\u2019s race, where Democrat Jim Hood, the state\u2019s attorney general, ran a competitive, but ultimately unsuccessful, race against Republican Tate Reeves, the lieutenant governor. Yet a year before the presidential election, the results offered warning signs for both parties. Voters in suburban swaths of Kentucky and Virginia sided with Democrats, a trend that would complicate Trump\u2019s path to re-election in 2020 if it holds. And the Democrats who made gains in Tuesday\u2019s election did so by largely avoiding positions such as the government-run healthcare plan \u201cMedicare for All\u201d that have animated the party\u2019s left flank in the Democratic presidential primary race. The elections also offered insight into Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans as he battles an accelerating impeachment inquiry. Democratic-aligned groups pumped huge amounts of money into the contests as a way to test-drive messaging and campaigns ahead of the 2020 election, particularly on gun control and clean energy. Beshear declared himself the winner in Kentucky after securing 49.2% of the vote to Bevin\u2019s 48.8%. As of late Tuesday night, Beshear led Bevin by a margin of more than 5,000 votes. But Bevin, who took the stage at the Republican party across town, called it a \u201cclose, close race\u201d and said he was not conceding \u201cby any stretch\u201d. \u201cWe want the process to be followed, and there is a process,\u201d he said. Bevin was elected in 2015 and had portrayed this election as a referendum on Trump, who stumped for the governor at a rally in Kentucky on Monday night and called Beshear \u201ctoo liberal, too extreme and too dangerous\u201d. At the rally, Trump told the crowd: \u201cIf you lose, it sends a really bad message \u2026 you can\u2019t let that happen to me.\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, sought to frame the Kentucky outcome as a net positive for Trump. \u201cThe president just about dragged Gov Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end.\u201d In a late-night tweet after results came in, Trump appeared to concede the Republican may have lost: \u201c@MattBevin picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!).\u201d A bullish Bevin had told the New York Times last month that he anticipated winning the election by between six and 10 points. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be shocked at how uncompetitive this actually is,\u201d he told the paper at the time. But while Trump won Kentucky with more than 60% of the vote in 2016 and remains popular in the state, with Republicans in other races there doing well on Tuesday, Bevin \u2013 who polls as one of America\u2019s most unpopular governors \u2013 could not ride that popularity to victory. Beshear, the state\u2019s attorney general and the son of Kentucky\u2019s last Democratic governor, made public education the cornerstone of his campaign, choosing a public high school assistant principal as his running mate and accusing Bevin of bullying schoolteachers who protested against proposed pension reforms. Bevin, who accused protesting teachers of acting \u201cthuggish\u201d and said school closures as a result of their actions would lead to children suffering sexual abuse and ingesting poison, said he did not regret his words. Beshear promised he would never bully anybody as governor. Bevin, meanwhile, fought on broader, national and cultural issues, highlighting his relationship with Trump and his support for the second amendment, while touting himself as the \u201cmost pro-life\u201d governor in America. While Bevin performed well in much of the state, in parts of Kentucky\u2019s largest city, Louisville, one could drive by dozens if not hundreds of \u201cStop Bevin \u2013 Vote Beshear!\u201d yard signs before passing any sign of support for the Republican. At the Democrats\u2019 election party at an event center in the predominantly African American Louisville neighbourhood of Smoketown, the mood turned from nervous to jovial as returns showed Beshear taking the lead. \u201cWe\u2019re off the bus, Bevin is out of here,\u201d said Jennifer Leano, 49, as she left the Beshear celebration. \u201cAfter he insulted the teachers, Bevin dug his own grave.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s race was one of several closely watched elections in states across the US on Tuesday. Republican Daniel Cameron made history in a resounding win in Kentucky\u2019s election for attorney general, becoming the first African American to win the office. Trump rallied Republican voters on Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, which he lost in 2016. Democrats have pledged that when they take power, they will pass an agenda that Republicans have blocked for years, including stricter gun laws, a higher minimum wage and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
