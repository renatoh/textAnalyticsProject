Armytage was to be the star host at a $200-a-head lunch at Sydney\u2019s Ivy on Friday at which Davis is speaking about her work with refugees, but organisers have replaced her at the 11th hour. The lunch will be hosted by Australia for UNHCR national director Naomi Steer instead. A spokeswoman for Australia for UNHCR gave no reason for the late change in host. \u201cI can confirm that Sam Armytage will not be hosting the lunch today,\u201d she told Guardian Australia on Friday. \u201cThe MC will be Australia for UNHCR national director Naomi Steer.\u201d Davis, who played Charlotte in the long-running TV show, agreed to an exclusive interview on the Seven breakfast show on condition the program would focus on her work with the UNHCR. But producers ignored the undertaking and, after a short segment on refugees, ambushed her with an arranged reading of a scene from Sex and the City. Other media organisations who tried to get interviews with Davis were told the award-winning humanitarian would speak only about the refugee crisis. Davis was sat at a table with Armytage who was dressed as Carrie Bradshaw in a blonde curly wig and read dialogue from the show. Co-host Natalie Barr was also wearing a wig. While Davis was polite she did look embarrassed and she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know that this is a great idea, frankly\u201d . After the segment aired, Davis took to Twitter to confirm her displeasure, retweeting a fan who said: \u201cThat was the worst piece of TV I\u2019ve ever seen. Kristin, you and your charity work is great. Shame Sunrise.\u201d Davis later responded positively to a tweet from Channel Nine\u2019s Lisa Wilkinson inviting her to talk on Sunrise\u2019s rival show next time she was in Australia. The executive producer of Sunrise, Michael Pell, had apologised for the segment on Thursday by saying the crew were all Sex and the City \u201ctragics\u201d. \u201cOur obsession may have gotten the better of us,\u201d Pell said. \u201cWe apologise for the bad acting and terrible costumes and we thank Kristin for being such a good sport. She is one of the most gracious stars we\u2019ve ever had on Brekky Central.\u201d Co-host David Koch and Armytage also apologised on air on Friday morning, but it wasn\u2019t enough to repair Armytage\u2019s relationship with the humanitarian organisation. In his apology at the end of the show Koch said that the Sex and the City skit was meant to be a bit of fun but Davis was offended. He said that since the segment had gone to air Australia for UNHCR had asked Armytage not to host and not to attend the lunch. Armytage said she was always willing to host, she supports the work of the organisation and she wishes them well. Davis appeared on Ten\u2019s The Project on Thursday evening, where the hosts joked about the Sunrise wig incident and asked her only one question about Sex and the City at the end of the interview. On Friday afternoon Australia for UNHCR and the Seven Network put out a joint statement. \u201cKristin Davis is a passionate high profile supporter of UNHCR,\u201d it said. \u201cShe has demonstrated this through her tireless commitments globally, as well as her recent trips to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo where she met Sister Angelique Namaika and saw UNHCR projects supporting refugee women and girls. \u201cShe came to Australia to help us launch the \u2018I will\u2019 campaign and raise much needed awareness and funds for refugees and displaced people living in shocking conditions. \u201cBy joint agreement from Network 7 and Australia for UNHCR, it was decided that today\u2019s \u2018In Conversation with Kristin Davis\u2019 lunch at the Ivy Ballroom would be MC\u2019d by Naomi Steer, National Director, Australia for UNHCR, to allow the focus to remain firmly on this important issue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
