Or he heralded in another long list of British losers signalling the approach of Wimbledon. It really depends on your point of view. People have disagreed about what is wrong with British tennis for a quarter of a century, and all that can safely be said about the 18-year-old Scot is that he is the only player who could remotely be regarded as the future of British tennis and is in line for a similar head-spinning mixture of praise and opprobrium that recently made Tim Henman lash out at the media after almost a decade of keeping silent. The terms of the disagreement become clearer when a comparison of Britain's best teenager is made with those of France. Murray's progress through two rounds at Queen's, which ended with a gallant failure against a former grand slam champion, can be placed alongside the 18-year-old Richard Gasquet's conquest of Roger Federer in April and the arrival in the world's top 20 of Tatiana Golovin at only 17. Even if you compare Murray, last year's US Open junior champion, with Ga\u00ebl Monfils, winner of the other three junior grand slams, a chasm emerges. The Frenchman is pushing up the top 90. Murray is No317 and will probably need a year before he is competing regularly on the main ATP Tour. Perfectly placed to understand the difference between the two countries is Patrice Hagelauer, the Lawn Tennis Association's performance director until 2003 and now the elite director in his native France. \"There are huge differences,\" he says. \"When you pay your taxes in France you know your money will go to schools and hospitals but also to sports facilities. \"Half the 9,000 clubs in France have been funded by cities and local authorities. It is totally different from Britain, where the clubs are mostly private, and the money comes from people. \"It's a huge, huge difference,\" he says, his voice rising with emphasis. \"Imagine how much money this represents.\" This is one reason why there are as many competitive players in Provence, where Hagelauer comes from, as all of Britain, and four times as many indoor courts in France as here. And when the base of the British playing pyramid is so much narrower, the apex is inevitably lower. This once caused Alan Jones, coach to the British No1 Elena Baltacha, to describe Britain as the Doncaster Rovers of the tennis world. \"That's where we are in terms of facilities,\" Jones asserts. \"And what level of expectation would you place on Doncaster Rovers? Then think of the level of expectation on our players.\" Even allowing for racon teur's licence, this point of view places an entirely different perspective on the volley most frequently launched against the LTA: that it receives millions annually from Wimbledon profits and yet British tennis has little to show for it. It would probably need billions for Britain to match what French tennis has acquired through its centralised sources. Since Hagelauer has gone, David Felgate has created more British tournaments, changed the ratings system, delivered more funds to coaches and improved the rankings of many of our full-time professionals. It has received little attention. Hagelauer admires all this. But he has a criticism. \"We have a programme for the young ones we call the Futures. I was one of those who started this programme in France, and it's where all our best players are coming from. \"It's a way of supporting children of 9, 10, 11 or 12. It provides tennis to some of the kids who have talent and motivation. And also parents who are supportive parents. I am 100% in favour of this. But this has stopped in Britain and probably David has some reason. But this was a priority for me when I was in Britain and I really believe this programme should be developed, not stopped.\" Felgate answers by saying that the Futures has been dropped in name only, and because the LTA was being criticised about which children were chosen for funding. It now allows the clubs to decide themselves. \"The same funding is going into junior tennis,\" he insists. \"It's just been directed more to the coaches, that's all.\" With Wimbledon starting on Monday Felgate is bracing himself for more harsh criticism akin to Doncaster failing to win the FA Cup, though he sees Tennis GB as more akin, in football terms, to a Championship team. \"It's the silly season again,\" he sighed. \"We have more players in the top 300 and I am delighted. Yet we will be judged by what players do at Wimbledon. But if I look at our players' rankings, only Tim and Greg [Rusedski] should be getting wins.\" Felgate is just as likely to be excited by the result of a junior player abroad as the dramas of SW19, and for self-protection has banned his family and friends from telling him what is in the papers. \"It's hard when you know you are doing the right thing and you are getting criticism,\" he admits. \"But just give us a little more time. Just leave us alone for another year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
