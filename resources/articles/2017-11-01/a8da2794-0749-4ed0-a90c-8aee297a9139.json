Pascal Gross and then Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo replied to goals by Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kurt Zouma to leave both sides with a point on the south coast, on a night when Peter Crouch made history of an altogether different kind. Brighton remain ninth in the Premier League while Stoke prolonged their own unbeaten run to three matches to stay 15th, four points above the relegation zone. Put to Mark Hughes that four of the five Premier League clubs beneath his side have sacked their managers this season, the Stoke manager smirked. \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get results in this game you get sacked, unfortunately.\u201d This, at least, proved thoroughly entertaining fare on a dank evening in east Sussex. Hughton had described Stoke as a \u201cvery manly side\u201d, no doubt a nod to their attritional approach and one that again paid dividends for their opener. Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s floated ball over the Brighton defence in search of Choupo-Moting caught Lewis Dunk cold \u2013 by the time the defender realised the whereabouts of his man, the Stoke striker had coolly slotted his third goal of the season beyond Mathew Ryan, the goalkeeper. Ruffled after going behind, Brighton were raging when Lee Mason awarded not a spot-kick but a goal-kick six minutes before the interval, when the Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross, already the crowd\u2019s pantomime villain, cut down Glenn Murray inside the box. It really was the definition of a penalty. \u201cI was just waiting for the referee to give it,\u201d Hughton said. Hughes, by comparison, felt the referee, who was roundly booed off at the final whistle, got it right. \u201cI think there was minimal contact,\u201d the Stoke manager said. Kevin Friend, the fourth official, calmed Hughton over the penalty appeal and played peacemaker moments later when Hughes erupted at Murray\u2019s meaty lunge on Kevin Wimmer. Once Brighton had composed themselves they pulled level, however. After a relentless driving run past a sea of Stoke shirts Davy Propper crossed for Gross \u2013 so often the supplier this season \u2013 to smash in an equaliser But less than two minutes later Stoke regained the lead, when Zouma\u2019s header from Choupo-Moting\u2019s flick had the Brighton net rippling once more. Then came the protracted celebrations, with Choupo-Moting joining the Chelsea loanee for a rehearsed jive in front of the North stand. Erik Pieters, too, joined in the fun from halfway. Izquierdo, a \u00a313.5m club-record signing from Club Brugge last summer, was lively but equally erratic in possession. He went close in the first half, dropping a curling effort wide of Lee Grant\u2019s goal after being slid in superbly by Propper, another summer signing, but he eventually prospered on the hour mark. Murray played in Izquierdo, whose pass pinballed off Pieters and back into his path, allowing the Colombian to rattle it home. \u201cI think he is improving with every week he is with us,\u201d Hughton added. \u201cHe admits himself that he has come from a league that perhaps is not as physical and the demands are different.\u201d Murray thrived throughout as Brighton\u2019s go-to man while another striker in his mid-30s prepared to make Premier League history late on. Stoke summoned Crouch from the bench in place of Shaqiri for the striker to make his 143rd appearance as a Premier League substitute, surpassing the record he previously shared with Shola Ameobi. Another striker, Saido Berahino, did not get on and it is now 633 days since the Stoke forward last found the net. A gritty draw was not enough for Hughes to feel the benefits of what, on another night, would probably be regarded as a point gained, however. \u201cOur reaction is tinged with disappointment,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAny away point is usually a good result but having got into a winning position on two occasions, that\u2019s where the disappointment lies.\u201d Brighton, too, tweaked personnel late on \u2013 Solly March, Izzy Brown and Ezequiel Schelotto all entered the action \u2013 as the Seagulls pushed and pushed for a winner. It never came, though, but despite an evening full of frustration the feelgood factor lives on at the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
