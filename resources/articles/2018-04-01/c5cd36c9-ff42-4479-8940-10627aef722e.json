Yeah, the boys are back in town! Or rather the city of Palo Alto, home of Silicon Valley in real life and Silicon Valley the sitcom, which is back for its fifth series following the trials and tribulations of Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) and his coders as they fight to get their start-up company Pied Piper off the blocks. Silicon Valley is an award-winning hit comedy by Mike Judge (a physics graduate who worked in the tech industry before moving into music and showbusiness and creating the likes of Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill and Idiocracy) that still retains the aura of a cult hit. Particularly here in the UK, its diehard fans \u2013 of which I am one \u2013 rarely come across each other. But perhaps like the nerds in the show \u2013 genius coder Richard, best-frenemies Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) and Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), Zach Woods as frail business manager Jared (\u201cMy uncle used to say I look like someone starved a virgin to death\u201d), bombastic irritant landlord of their digs Erlich Bachman (TJ Miller) \u2013 we do our best work (or worshipping) alone. We left Pied Piper facing a rare moment of success at the end of the last series \u2013 fully funded for its new project, creating a decentralised internet that can potentially render the group\u2019s nemesis Gavin Belson\u2019s giant server company Hooli obsolete. Outside the show, things were trickier \u2013 Miller, who as the unrestrained id of the hacker hostel was many fans\u2019 favourite, suddenly announced that he was leaving the show and rumours of how, why and exactly when threatened to overwhelm everything else. The when and how have been answered at least. As far as the fifth season is concerned, Ehrlich is exactly where Gavin left him at the end of the fourth \u2013 stoned out of his mind in a Tibetan opium den as they made their way back from Gavin\u2019s journey to find enlightenment. In his landlord\u2019s absence, Jian Yang, a tenant with an almost nobly implacable, unswerving hatred of Ehrlich, is filling the hacker hostel with friends and trying to have his nemesis declared dead so he can inherit the house and Erlich\u2019s shares. With Yang destroying life on the domestic front, it is up to Richard to keep things going professionally. He needs to hire a dozen distributed system engineers. So far Gilfoyle and Dinesh have agreed on three and rejected 63 \u2013 all of whom Gavin snaps up for Hooli to stymie further Pied Piper progress. He tries instead to acquire Optimoji, a company on the verge of bankruptcy. The owner is reluctant to sell and fire most of her 30 engineers. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to only be able to save half your family,\u201d says Jared \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s the only way.\u201d He reassures Richard once the contract is drawn up: \u201cIt will be cosy! Holed up here like the Branch Davidians.\u201d When Optimoji goes with a better offer from pizza delivery company Sliceline, Richard shows how much he has evolved \u2013 or devolved \u2013 from the nervy, indecisive, conscience-stricken geek we first met. Whether it\u2019s the advent of proper power, proper money, real responsibility or simple exposure to Gavin or a potent mixture of them all, Richard finds a way to bankrupt Sliceline and get an officeful of coders for a knock-down price. I love this show deeply, for its one-liners, the immaculate playing of its ensemble cast and magnificent peripheral characters but also for its odd heroes. It\u2019s not clear to me, therefore, how well this continuing corruption of Richard \u2013 which seemed, and realistically so, to have been arrested by the end of the last series after a horrified Jared departed the company \u2013 can play. The show manages brilliantly to keep the audience onside through a lot corporate and computing detail, but the remaining bandwidth needs to be used for emotional rather than intellectual investment. The beleaguered nerd, forced out of his comfort zone by the demands of success, made him the heart of the group, had us rooting for him and made Jared\u2019s fierce loyalty credible. If he morphs into Gavin, we will all lose a lot. Especially Jared. And I don\u2019t think I can bear to watch his starved virgin ghost face suffer any more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
