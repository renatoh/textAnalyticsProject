Michaella Krajicek is 15 years old and the No1 seed in the girls' singles tournament at this year's Wimbledon. On the way to demolishing 17-year-old Vojislava Lukic of Serbia and Montenegro in their quarter-final yesterday, she demonstrated a good proportion of the power that brought her brother the 1996 men's title and absolutely nothing of his placid temperament. At 5-1 up, a failure to take the set on a break point provoked her into smashing her racket into the turf. Early in the second set, when the destiny of the match was no longer in any doubt, an unfriendly net cord led her to belt the offending ball behind her, nearly decapitating a startled line judge. Women's tennis, and the battle to succeed within it, is an increasingly emotional business. That passion was equally apparent in the first of the women's semi-finals yesterday, when the 17-year-old Maria Sharapova came from a set down to beat the 1999 champion, Lindsay Davenport, on the Centre Court. The Russian girl's fighting spirit and self-confidence were as much the key to success as her ferocious ground strokes. \"I definitely did not have that degree of confidence when I started,\" the 29-year-old Davenport said at the end of what will be her final Wimbledon appearance. \"I was much more shy and not really aware of how good I was. For a number of years I wasn't sure if I belonged here. The girls who've come up in the last few years definitely have a lot more confidence.\" But women's tennis, long the subject of criticism from outside, has been under fire again this week. The current Nos 1 and 2 in the world are both Belgian, which is bad enough. Even worse, neither of them made it to SW19 this year. The pair they displaced at the top of the rankings, the always controversial Williams sisters, have fallen from eminence in a way that puts a question mark against their continued commitment to the game. Whatever the level of the tennis on display at grand slam tournaments in recent seasons, five all-Williams finals and two all-Belgian finals certainly lowered the level of interest at the global box office. And when the recent French Open produced two finalists who were neither Belgian nor named Williams, there was still no improvement. Anastasia Myskina and Elena Dementieva, friends since childhood, produced the least compelling grand slam final in years. Serena Williams has been defending her title here, but sometimes in such a way as to strengthen a feeling that, at 22, her burgeoning acting career is starting to take precedence over her tennis. \"She's not real any more,\" Mats Wilander commented this week. \"She doesn't really like tennis. You can tell. She's not playing from the heart. It's all contrived. She just wants to look good.\" Wilander's comments ungenerously failed to take account of 12 months that have included a lengthy convalescence from serious knee surgery and the fatal shooting of her sister. But they are typical of those who feel that women's tennis consistently short-changes its audience, not least through the system of hothouse rearing that produces an apparently endless procession of semi-dysfunctional children who soon start to see themselves as celebrities first and tennis players second. Sharapova, who left Russia at the age of nine to study at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Florida, provides evidence both for and against the argument. Her early migration entailed a separation from her mother lasting two vital years of her childhood, and she certainly betrays some of the signs of the self-obsessed, over-privileged tennis prodigy. On the other hand, she talks after her matches with ease and an impressive degree of eloquence, as well as a perfect command of teenage American idiom. When she mentioned that she had prefaced today's match by completing a sociology essay, someone asked if it had helped take her mind off the coming ordeal. No, she replied, that's not how it works. \"When I do one thing, I concentrate on that thing. When I do the other thing, I concentrate on that.\" Sharapova's father was up in the players' box yesterday, maintaining the active involvement that took him to Florida with his daughter eight years ago. Like many tennis dads, he has come in for his share of criticism. But on court his daughter, like Venus and Serena Williams, displays an admirable degree of independence and self-motivation. Like young women in the workplace, young women on the tennis court are displaying higher levels of assertiveness and aggression than their male contemporaries. Benefitting from the legacy of feminism, they are relishing the chance to discover where ambition can take them. True, some of them - like young Lukic yesterday - still cast beseeching glances at their coaches when fate turns against them. But as time goes on and women players continue to evolve, that weakness will probably be bred out. The positive side-effects are fascinating. Women players are less likely than men to make eye contact at the toss-up, less likely to turn the post-match salute into a clasp of hands or an arm around the shoulder, more likely to be asked about their personal feuds with their competitors, and more likely to exhibit a command of the subtle arts of tennis gamesmanship. And on yesterday's evidence from the Centre Court, they are at least as likely to provide tennis full of high drama, blazing aggression and fluctuating fortunes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
