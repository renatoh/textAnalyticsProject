Hormones may also have played a significant part in her defeat at odds of 4-11 as she was found to be in season shortly afterwards, but whatever the reason, she simply could not reel in Dar Re Mi when she kicked for home over a furlong out. It was clear that the odds-on favourite was in trouble a quarter of a mile from home, as Jamie Spencer started to ride Sariska vigorously and Jimmy Fortune, on Dar Re Mi, took the chance to grab a lead. Few jockeys defend an advantage as robustly as Fortune, but he did not need to ride at maximum strength to keep Sariska at bay by three-quarters of a length. \"I think there are three factors to consider,\" Bell said. \"Firstly, she has been beaten by a very good filly in her own right, secondly, the ground was probably faster than ideal as she goes through soft easier than most and thirdly, and the most significant factor, is she has come into season immediately after the race. \"There were no signs of it before the race but when she came back in, she lifted her tail and showed signs of being in season. When the vet trotted her up afterwards she was sound but it was streaming out of her, so it is a very significant factor. Who knows if it affected her performance but we'll assume that it did.\" The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe remains the obvious target for Sariska, though she is out to 16-1 (from 8-1) with Coral. Dar Re Mi, meanwhile, is likely to run next in the Prix Vermeille, before heading either to the Breeders' Cup or a valuable fillies' event at Kyoto in mid-December. \"We would meet a filly called Stacelita [the French Oaks winner] in the Vermeille,\" John Gosden, her trainer, said, \"and she can go like the wind, so it's a very interesting division this year.\" \"She's out of a phenomenal mare [Darara] and has probably got the best pedigree of any filly I've trained in my life.\" Lady Of The Desert was a better ally for the backers as she came three lengths clear in the Group Two Lowther Stakes, and she is now top-priced at 12-1 for next spring's 1,000 Guineas. Martin Dwyer, the winner's jockey, was riding for the first time in a fortnight, having become the latest victim of a ban under the totting-up rules. \"I've got three more days hanging over me which will kick in when I get another day,\" Dwyer said. \"It's the bane of every jockey's life at the moment, it's ruining summer racing. You go to the everyday meetings and you daren't move. If it looks like you might have to squeeze through or that the gap might close, then you just have to let it go.\" With prize money to 10th place, Ryan Moore was not letting anything go in the opening St Leger Yearling Stakes, but when his horse crossed Neil Callan's mount Rodrigo De Torres, Callan was unseated and Moore picked up an eight-day ban for careless riding. He will miss the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on 5 September, and the first two days of the St Leger meeting at Doncaster. Meanwhile, Frankie Dettori succeeded in geting a four-day ban reduced to three earlier in the day enabling him to ride Delegator for Godolphin in the Celebratiojn Mile at Goodwood a week tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
