Burton\u2019s heavy defeat in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at the Etihad Stadium ended their hopes of reaching the final, yet when asked what his opposite number told him at full time Clough remained light-hearted. \u201cHe said: \u2018Come in for a glass of wine.\u2019 I hope he\u2019s got more than a glass,\u201d said the visiting manager, who insists his side will use the return leg in a fortnight to celebrate reaching the last four. \u201cDo I wish we hadn\u2019t played? Not at all, we have made history in getting this far. It wasn\u2019t about tonight it was about the achievement of getting here. We kept going right to the end, they were shouting: \u2018We want 10\u2019. And we stopped them, that\u2019s a positive for us. \u201cI told them that front five, if they reach the Champions League semi-final, will give Real Madrid or whoever they play a problem.\u201d As Clough paid tribute to City\u2019s attacking quintet of Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Leroy San\u00e9, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva, Guardiola referenced Clough\u2019s late father, Brian, who is considered one of the greatest domestic managers. \u201cHis father showed him some tricks,\u201d said City\u2019s manager. \u201cYou know better than me what Clough means \u2013 all he won \u2013 and the respect for the way he played, his charisma. It\u2019s an honour for me personally to play against a Clough. \u201cI wanted to congratulate them for an incredible tournament. They beat mythical teams \u2013 like Aston Villa and Middlesbrough. We\u2019re not a team who has a lot of titles in our museum so you have to take these chances to get to the final. You have to take it in the first leg.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
