At the time, she was pushing a stroller and walking to pick her son up from school. A young man in a passing ute unleashed a torrent of expletives, telling her to drown her five-month-old daughter and \u201cgo the fuck back to where you came from.\u201d Clarke, a poet and author of Afro-Caribbean descent, had initially planned on writing a memoir tracing her family history back to West Africa, from where her ancestors were forced to leave as part of the slave trade. The ute driver\u2019s hateful invective prompted further reflection on race relations in Australia, and the insidious attitudes and injustices that culminate in overtly racist attacks. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand casual racism,\u201d says Clarke. Instead of tracing her ancestry, she began working on what could become The Hate Race. The memoir chronicles her childhood in Australia as well as the indelible effects of schoolyard bullying. The cumulative effect of racist remarks is \u201clike a poison,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt eats away the very essence of your being.\u201d Born in Sydney to a mathematician father and actress mother, Clarke grew up in predominantly white suburbia in the 80s and 90s. She was first made aware of her race in preschool, when a girl singled out her skin colour. In the years that followed, there came relentless taunts, spitballs, malicious letters and cartoons, and teachers and counsellors ill-equipped to confront racist behaviour or who dismissed it as just \u201ca little bit of teasing\u201d. The horrific name-calling infected Clarke\u2019s self-perception. \u201cI knew exactly what I was,\u201d she writes. Coon. Blackie. Golliwog. Monkey Girl. The persistent bullying was crushing: Somewhere along the line, we just give in. Somewhere along the line, we stop reporting. Somewhere along the line, we die a little. Clarke\u2019s longing for acceptance, to be one of the popular girls with \u201csun-kissed skin and wavy blonde hair\u201d, was physically manifested. At nights she unconsciously scratched at her face, trying \u201cto claw my way out of my skin\u201d. Earlier, as a seven-year-old, she rejoiced when a light patch appeared on her cheek, because she had fantasised about her skin turning white. \u201cThe metamorphosis was starting; the ugly duckling becoming a swan,\u201d she writes. It turned out to be vitiligo, a pigmentation disorder, which later resolved. For Clarke, whose short-story collection Foreign Soil won an Australian Book Industry Award last year, the bullying fuelled a desire to succeed. She was academically gifted and excelled at debating and public speaking \u2013 presaging her later success as a spoken word poet. The bullying has shaped her adult self, Clarke admits, but she is wary of her story being held up as an example of triumph over adversity. \u201cFor every one of me there\u2019s probably a thousand other kids who have anxiety issues or whose experiences have snowballed into a negative adulthood or depression,\u201d she says. Bullying by no means \u201cmakes kids tougher and more wanting to succeed. I think often it just crushes people.\u201d The resurgence of xenophobia in Australia troubles Clarke. She sees an \u201cawful synchronicity\u201d between past and present. Her parents left England in the 70s, soon after Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech, which decried black immigrants and predicted that foreign children would overcrowd hospitals and schools. Two decades later, Clarke watched Pauline Hanson\u2019s entr\u00e9e into politics with a shockingly similar maiden speech, accompanied by a shift in public sentiment around race and immigration. Unsurprisingly, she is not optimistic about Hanson\u2019s return, the rise of One Nation and Islamophobic rhetoric. \u201cI feel as if there is really a global post-colonial situation at the moment,\u201d which especially victimises children, Clarke says. \u201cThere are children\u2019s bodies being brutalised or being washed up on beaches. We see brown children being locked up on Nauru and in Villawood Detention Centre. We see things like Don Dale and Indigenous communities having their funding cut.\u201d But Clarke does see hope in Australia\u2019s young people. \u201cI look at my kids\u2019 generation, and their outlook and the way they behave towards each other is different from anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime,\u201d she says. The cultural makeup of Australia has changed since Clarke\u2019s childhood, and diversity in books, television, and online media have played a major role. Sharing stories breeds tolerance through understanding, Clarke believes. \u201cIt\u2019s a wide big world and that there are lots of different kinds of people in it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best thing [a child] could possibly do is to learn to get along with everybody, because that\u2019s just part of life.\u201d The Hate Race is published by Hachette. Maxine Beneba Clarke will give the opening keynote address at the Melbourne Writers Festival on August 26."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
