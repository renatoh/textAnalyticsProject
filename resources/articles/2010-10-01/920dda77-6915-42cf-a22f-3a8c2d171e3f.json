The 14 sequinned sets of dancers tremble and twinkle in the wings. Bruce Forsyth steps out with more zest at 82 than some of us can muster at less than half that age on a Friday night \u2013 he should be studied and possibly mined for alternative energy sources that could save the planet before it's too late \u2013 and Tess Daly still has a rictus grin on her face and a look in her eyes that speaks of deep panic at the thought of having to walk and talk simultaneously once more. All then, at the beginning of the eighth series of the BBC's flamencoing flagship Strictly Come Dancing, is present and correct. It isn't quite the first episode \u2013 that was aired a few weeks ago, ostensibly to introduce us to the latest celebrity dancers but really to prove to a disbelieving nation that the rumours that Ann Widdecombe was a 2010 participant were true and to give all those who wished to do so time to crunch down on their cyanide capsules or at least leave the country. Since then they have all been in training for last night's first contest, in which seven of the couples will waltz or cha-cha for our delectation (the other seven are on tonight). After the obligatory training montage, it's time for the first couple \u2013 Felicity Kendal, in the best frock of the night, and Vincent Simone \u2013 to cha-cha-cha. Judge Len Goodman thinks there wasn't enough hip action, fabulously patronising platitudes spew forth from Alesha Dixon (don't call Felicity Kendal \"babe\", love. Just don't) and Craig Revel Horwood earns his usual boos by Cowelling it up and damning Felicity's \"flat-footed\" efforts. After that, the traditional Strictly moments come thick and fast. Scott Maslen from Eastenders shows himself to be this year's blockish-but-creditable male who survives by getting the basic steps right and letting his partner writhe round him. Goldie provides delicious relief in a disco version of the cha-cha. Patsy Kensit has the first sob story, with coy references to her \"bad year\" (her fourth marriage broke up in August), and Matt Baker \u2013 Blue Peter, Countryfile \u2013 is the surprise of the night, a beautiful natural dancer who annihilates all-comers and with whom the audience falls completely in love. But all this is so much detail. Where, the nation wants to know, is Widders? Are they going to give us what we want or are they going to hold her over as bait for tomorrow night? The latter, of course. Curses! Never mind. The penultimate couple comprises James Jordan and G2's very own agony aunt, psychologist and former comedienne Dr Pamela Stephenson who wows the judges with her grace and brings tears to Bruno's eyes with the beauty of her arm placement. Hurrah! And finally ... you'll like this. Not a lot, but \u2013 it's Paul Daniels. He sings along to the music but do you know what? For a 72-year-old man who is basically seven-eighths potato, he doesn't do too badly. As long as you don't judge him by any kind of objective scale. And at least Alesha manages not to call him 'babe'. As ever with Strictly, you are left by the end grateful for the smallest mercies. Let's hope there are some tomorrow night too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
