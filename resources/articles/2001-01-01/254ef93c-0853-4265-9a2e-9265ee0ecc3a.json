Kevin Pressman stands behind the team with the second-worst goals-against total in the Nationwide - and Premier - leagues and, at the moment, he is doing it virtually on one leg. Wednesday concede nearly two goals a game on average, so he was naturally pleased with what was only their third shut-out of an abysmal season. Pressman is playing with his left leg strapped up with an impressive bandage. \"It's actually doing a great job keeping me together,\" he said. \"I'm struggling on, not training, just playing games and trying to look after it. I've torn a muscle and, in an ideal world, would not be playing but we're hardly in an ideal world. \"It's painful, my kicking is a shambles and it winds me up. I'm only 70% fit but the gaffer asked me to do a job because it would be unfair to put kids in. He thinks the pressure of our situation could do lasting damage to a young lad, so I'm happy to play for the cause.\" Pressman could be forgiven for being less than enthusiastic about Wednesday's wellbeing - he is currently involved in a financial row with them and is likely to leave in the summer when his contract ends. It is a measure of their decline that Wednesday are forced to play an unfit goalkeeper but the 31-year-old clearly has feelings for a club where he has been a fixture for years. \"Our aim has got to be safety as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"We've got to do it now and not at the end of the season.\" They could not have a better working model than Huddersfield, who completed an astonishing December unbeaten under Lou Macari, having won five and drawn two, scoring 15 and conceding four. Before that they won only one game. Even the manager finds it hard to believe. \"I thought it might happen in three months but not a month, and I don't think I can expect them to go on beating everybody. So I'm happy with this point.\" Huddersfield created chances, with Pressman making three decent saves, and Wednesday had to survive a 15-minute siege at the end with 10 men after their substitute Gerald Sibon was booked twice in two minutes. Huddersfield will be without their captain Chris Lucketti, who had surgery on a broken nose yesterday, at Crystal Palace today. And Wednesday will again start with their on-loan Australian centre-back Con Blatsis against Grimsby, after his impressive debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
