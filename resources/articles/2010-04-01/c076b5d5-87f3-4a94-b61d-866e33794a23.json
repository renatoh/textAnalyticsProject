And to National Service 2.0 \u2013 the civilian version! Who cares what the parties say about the economy, education or foreign policy? It's all lies spewing like puke from a wardful of norovirus patients. Getting hold of some sense within the flobbering flummery (\"We are going to invest half the exponential seasonally-adjusted real-time figure in double-pike stages over the next 3.78 quarters, which will make 70-squinky per cent of people 0.9 acres McHappier within a bushel of Tuesdays\") is too hard. You would have to give up your job and spend eight hours a day sifting through it all to have any hope of making an informed choice. We have to circumscribe with specific questions those who would seek to bamboozle us. Perhaps even requiring specific answers, as in a Cosmo quiz. Party leaders, what would you do with Britain's remaining mobile libraries? Would you: a) Put more books in them? b) Put more computers in them? c) Turn them into mobile fives courts? Or perhaps: party leaders, what are you going to do about the fact that Cheryl Cole was recently named Most Inspirational Woman of the Decade, given that I cannot live in a world where this title, be it ever so unofficially and trivially bestowed, continues to rest on the aforementioned human Twiglet? Will you: a) Strip her of it forthwith? b) Strip of the vote all those involved in its creation and conferral? c) Both of the above? But what I really want to know is this: where do they stand on the great Proper Nouns in Scrabble Controversy of 2010? This \u2013 the introduction by Hasbro of new rules to the game allowing, for the first time since its invention 60-odd years ago, the playing of People's Names and other Customarily Capitalised Words \u2013 should become the election issue, enshrining as it does about 82 vexed issues in one. To have a Proper Nouns in Scrabble policy is to tell the public all they ever need to know about you and your party. It goes to the very heart of some of the most important philosophical debates of our age. Are you a progressive or a traditionalist? Once the rules \u2013 any rules \u2013 have been decided, is there ever a good enough reason for changing them? Is there a natural law for Scrabble? Is this a sensible accommodation of commercial realities (Hasbro says the move is to attract younger players to the game) or another manifestation of the slide into decadence and corruption in which we are warned all civilisations must ultimately end? The Romans had their bread, circuses and Caligulan debaucheries. Will we have \"Beyonce\" without an accent, \"Kodak\" on a triple, and only ourselves to blame as the barbarians start beating down the gates once more? Is Scrabble being dumbed down or democratised? Should we be ashamed of the fact that the manufacturer is having to make allowances for the spread of illiteracy among some of the wealthiest nations on earth, or pleased that the game is being rejuvenated and made accessible to all? Is conventional spelling there to lift you up or keep you under? Would you reward a teacher who believed the former or have her shot by a Student Voice panel and hung in the IT room as a warning to others? In short, party leaders, which of the following statements best represents your stance on this matter? a) I will issue a booklet of forms to every household that will allow them to define which set of rules they will play to before they begin. Compromise over conflict. Doesn't that seem best? Would you like a sandwich? b) I will get Smythson to stock a leather Scrabble carrycase that fits only the original board? c) I will replace all the letters with numbers and put a calculator in every pot?
