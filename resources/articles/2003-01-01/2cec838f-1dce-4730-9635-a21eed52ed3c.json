Kelly was today released on bail by police investigating allegations of sexual abuse against young boys. The 52-year-old host of Stars in Their Eyes, of Chiswick, west London, had been questioned by officers from Surrey police since early this morning following his arrest last night at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Mr Kelly is due to answer bail at Guildford police station, where he had been held overnight, on March 12, a police spokesman said. The chef husband of one of Ireland's best-known TV cookery show presenters was today given a conditional nine-month suspended jail sentence for having at his home up to 1,000 computer images of children, some as young as five. Tim Allen, 52, who is married to celebrity chef Darina Allen, of the Ballymaloe Cookery School in County Cork, pleaded guilty in an Irish district court to a charge connected with a nationwide police investigation of child pornography. He admitted possessing pornographic material under the terms of the 1980 Irish Child Trafficking and Pornography Act. Father-of-four Allen's home was one of more than 100 addresses throughout the Irish Republic raided by police last May in an internationally linked move against internet child pornography activities, codenamed Operation Amethyst. Allen said he had come to the court \"making absolutely no excuse\" for his behaviour. He was horrified at what he had done and it had brought considerable shame on both him and his family, and wrecked his credibility. Allen also said he accepted the kind of activity he had been involved in \"did untold damage to young people\". Clinical psychologist Dr Tony Humphreys said Allen had sought help from him about his problem about six weeks before the raid on his home. The jail term was suspended by district court judge Michael Pattwell on condition that Allen was found suitable to carry out community service and paid \u00a326,000 (40,000 euros) to a children's charity. He said he would rule on the sentence later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
