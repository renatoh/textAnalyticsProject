They acquit themselves well but, given that only last year it enjoyed a superb television production with Anthony Hopkins and Ian McKellen, I don\u2019t quite see why it has been revived so soon. Watching the play again, what strikes me is Harwood\u2019s equivocal attitude to his two main characters. You can see Sir, about to give his 227th Lear in a threadbare touring production at the height of wartime air-raids, as a symbol of the pluck and endurance of old-style Shakespearean actors: at the same time, Harwood shows the character to be vain, deluded, petty and something of an old groper. Similarly Sir\u2019s longtime dresser, Norman, can be viewed as the embodiment of constancy, coaxing a crumbling star back on to the stage, or as a bitchily proprietorial figure resentful of his subservience. I suspect this says something about Harwood\u2019s own ambivalence towards the world he portrays. On the one hand, he delights in old theatrical stories such as Sir\u2019s dismissal of a rival\u2019s Lear with, \u201cI was pleasantly disappointed\u201d and his instruction to a fellow actor that \u201cyou must find what light you can\u201d. But Harwood, who spent five years on the road with Sir Donald Wolfit, paints a chillingly authentic picture of cold suppers in cheerless digs and of endless travel on Sunday trains. The play is less a love letter to theatre than a reminder of the grottiness behind the greasepaint. Its great virtue is that it provides actors with two succulent lead roles. Stott certainly captures Sir\u2019s blend of physical disintegration and professional survival: first seen sobbing uncontrollably at his dressing room table, his eyes acquire a fitful gleam at the magic words \u201cfull house\u201d. Stott, who has something of the earthiness of Leo McKern, also embodies the durability of the old pro who knows how to use a stentorian voice to outdo thunder sheets and wind machines. But, while Stott is very good at conveying the contradictions of Harwood\u2019s falling star, his performance will be even better when it makes the gear changes less visible. Shearsmith, as he proved when playing the executioner\u2019s mate in Martin McDonagh\u2019s Hangmen, is adept at portraying the creepiness of life\u2019s second fiddles, and his Norman is already spot-on: dapper, busy, waspish and seething with love-hate towards the actor on whom he totally depends. Even if the joke about the need for a light Cordelia is overdone, Harriet Thorpe invests Sir\u2019s long-suffering partner, Her Ladyship, with a mix of majesty and clear-sightedness, and Selina Cadell is the epitome of the briskly sensible stage manager. Sean Foley\u2019s production has more than a touch of Noises Off in its evocation of the ordered chaos of backstage life and the evening passes pleasantly enough. But, if the intention is to honour Harwood\u2019s distinguished 50 years in the business, I feel the producers could have dipped more daringly into his extensive back catalogue. \u2022 At the Duke of York\u2019s, London, until 14 January.
