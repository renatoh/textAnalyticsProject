The pair first started talking on Instagram in January, through a popular account that offered a contemporary version of traditional newspaper personal ads. Owens, a 29-year-old artist and professor, had never had much luck on dating apps, but the Personals page was different. It did not use photos, but instead featured a long list of bios of queer and trans people looking for internet friends, lovers or partners across the globe. Vel\u00e1squez and Owens\u2019 DMs turned into daily phone calls, they got engaged in April, Vel\u00e1squez moved from Los Angeles to North Carolina to be with Owens in May, and the two are getting married next month, just before the one-year anniversary of their first Instagram chat. Personals, too, is undergoing a fundamental change. The service, which has posted roughly 10,000 ads since its creation in 2017, ended its Instagram service this week and on Thursday officially launched as an app. Rebranded as Lex, the dating and social app aims to provide an alternative platform to connect people who are lesbian, bisexual, asexual, womxn, trans, genderqueer, intersex, two-spirit and non-binary. In other words, Lex is not meant for cis men. \u201cWith dating apps like Tinder, the queer people are an afterthought. It\u2019s not built into their kind of binary system,\u201d said Kell Rakowski, the founder of Personals and Lex. \u201cThis is completely different than what is currently out there \u2026 and it\u2019s run by queer people.\u201d The idea for Personals grew out of @h_e_r_s_t_o_r_y, the viral lesbian culture Instagram account through which Rakowski for years shared historic images, memes, photos of queer icons and other \u201cdyke imagery\u201d. The 40-year-old photo editor in New York City was looking for content for the page in 2017 when she stumbled on archives of On Our Backs, an erotica magazine from the 80s and 90s run by women. Rakowski was particularly enamored with the vintage personal ads written by lesbians, which outlined their desires and romantic requirements: \u201cThey were just so funny and also sexy and tantalizing,\u201d she said. She began posting them on the Herstory account, and they immediately attracted a lot of interest. \u201cI just started to think, why don\u2019t we do this today?\u201d she said. She started with a simple format \u2013 a Google Docs form where people could submit their own ads that she would then publicly share on her Instagram. She quickly grew overwhelmed with submissions and ended up creating a separate Instagram for the ads called @_personals_. Personals avoided the superficial and often depressing nature of swiping right and left on selfies. It also drew a wide audience with its distinctly queer lexicon. People advertised themselves with phrases like \u201cdykefag fatty\u201d, \u201cshy genderqueer\u201d, \u201ctransmasc dyke\u201d, \u201cpower bottom\u201d, \u201cwitchy\u201d and other terms that would attract dismissive or abusive posts on a mainstream dating app, but were familiar and meaningful to LGBTQIA people. \u201cThese are queer queer words,\u201d said Rakowski. \u201cIt\u2019s just so built into the culture.\u201d By 2018, the account had drawn national attention, connecting tens of thousands of people from around the world for online chats, friendships and dates. \u201cThere are so many folks in our community who are isolated \u2026 who are far away from larger cities and other LGBTQ people. This is a great way to meet friends,\u201d said Vel\u00e1squez, an artist, noting that Personals has also offered an alternative to some queer scenes that can feel toxic or unwelcoming to some people. Over the years, Rakowski has heard wild stories of love born on her Instagram page, often from people posting with the #MetOnPersonals tag. One person flew from Toronto, to Sydney to meet someone for a trip that ended in marriage. Rakowski also heard of a trip to a desert for a first date, which lasted 10 days. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing back the old-school way of reading personal ads, reading how people describe themselves, slowing down,\u201d said Rakowski. \u201cIt\u2019s a gentler, more thoughtful way of getting to know someone.\u201d Rakowski, however, has struggled to keep up with the demand, and eventually it became clear that a developed app could build upon the concept, but reach more people and be more efficient. Lex functions like Personals, but automatically uploads posts and allows users to filter by location and search for keywords like \u201cbutch\u201d, \u201cbottom\u201d or \u201cpizza\u201d. The app has a \u201czero tolerance policy towards creeps ... no transphobia, no racism, no fatphobia, no ableism, no hate speech of any kind\u201d. Earlier this year, Personals was accused of having a \u201cwhite privilege problem\u201d after there was a public dispute between the page and a new unaffiliated QPOC (queer people of color) Personals. Rakowski, who is white, said she wanted to prioritize the safety of people who were typically excluded or mistreated on dating sites, and that she has encouraged people who are white to list that factor so that there isn\u2019t an assumption that white is the default race. Rakowski decided to change the name to Lex in large part to make it harder for cis men to find. Even during beta testing in recent months, cis men have managed to find the app and posted ads with messages like \u201clooking for college girls\u201d. In a recent post, Lex noted there were many other app options for cis queer men and that Lex was meant to be \u201ccentered around the other queers of the world\u201d. Alysia Brown, a 29-year-old music supervisor, said she found her first real relationship through Personals after struggling on other apps: \u201cI was on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Her, all the apps \u2026 and they are very boring in terms of small talk. I say \u2018hey\u2019 and they say \u2018hey\u2019 and then I never respond again. With Personals, you have a conversation immediately.\u201d Personals also provided a safer space for her to be more direct about her desires and state that she was a \u201cblack queer person looking for another queer POC\u201d, Brown said. Bee Stothert, a 26-year-old London photographer who met her partner on Personals, said it was one of the rare places on the internet that has brought people joy: \u201cSocial media can be so scary and alienating and a lonely place. And this really brings people together. It sounds cheesy, but it\u2019s so true.\u201d It was refreshing for Stothert to move away from a visually based app and just focus on people\u2019s personalities and interests. On Personals, \u201cI don\u2019t even think about what the person is going to potentially look like.\u201d Owens\u2019 Personals post \u2013 which said \u201c28 QPOC, PhD \u2026 Ravenclaw. Mum. Artist. World wanderer \u2026 Memes are my love language\u201d \u2013 prompted a simple and sweet DM from Vel\u00e1squez: \u201cHey there! Nice to know of you, I think you\u2019re great.\u201d For a brief moment, Owens was skeptical that it would lead to something serious, but she said the connection with Vel\u00e1squez was instant: \u201cWe are both chronic oversharers. We were spilling our life story right away.\u201d It was bittersweet to see the Instagram personals end, Owens said, adding that she was grateful to meet so many people through the page: \u201cIt just really became a tight-knit community even though the people are spread all across the country, and all across the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
