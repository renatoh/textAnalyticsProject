Arsenal could only draw 0-0 at home to United on Wednesday night in the wake of Saturday's 5-1 defeat at Liverpool. But Szczesny said Arsenal could take heart from the more resilient display, in which he made two vital saves to deny the United striker Robin van Persie. He also advanced the draw as evidence that the Anfield debacle is \"out of our system\". With Chelsea gaining only a point at West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday and Manchester City's home fixture against Sunderland on Wednesday being postponed, Arsenal sit only one point off the top of the table. \"We are in a good position in the league, and we are still in the FA Cup and the Champions League, so I don't know what kind of frustration we should have,\" Szczesny said. \"The frustration should have been a year or two ago when we were struggling. We're still there at the top of the table. We are going to push for the title. We are still confident. He added: \"I was happy with a clean sheet against United because we had to recover from conceding five goals on Saturday \u2013 and I thought we were solid defensively, as we always are at home. We didn't get the three points and that's disappointing, but I think we got back on track with the clean sheet and, hopefully, we can push on from here. \"If we could have a similar last ten games to last season, we'd be in a good position. With the football we play \u2026 other teams might get tired, but we seem to push on. Hopefully we'll do the same thing again and that will give us a good chance.\" The Liverpool result was made all the more shocking because Arsenal had conceded only four goals in their previous 10 matches in all competitions. They were 4-0 down after 20 minutes at Anfield. \"You can see from the good performance against United that it is out of our system,\" Szczesny said. \"It was just an accident. They were terrific offensively, we were a little bit weak defensively, and we got punished. I don't think you can say you saw the real Arsenal at Anfield. \"We've seen the real Arsenal over the last year. Our defensive record has been amazing. It was a little bit humiliating to concede five on Saturday and we want to recover as soon as possible. It's a good chance to do that a week after.\" Szczesny believes that fourth-placed Liverpool, whose last-minute win at Fulham on Wednesday lifted them to within four points of the leaders, Chelsea, ought to be considered as title contenders, especially as Brendan Rodgers' side have not had the demands of European football this season. \"I don't know whether that's an advantage,\" Szczesny said. \"I wouldn't give up European football. It's very enjoyable. You can also look at it as gaining experience when you do play in the Champions League. Maybe they will have more energy but I wouldn't swap it. There are four teams in the title race and it makes it more exciting.\" Liverpool are expected to field their strongest lineup at the Emirates but Wenger, with an eye on Wednesday's Champions League last-16 first leg at home to Bayern Munich, would like to rest the centre-forward Olivier Giroud, among others. Giroud has borne a heavy physical burden this season, and he did not start in either of the club's previous FA Cup ties, against Tottenham Hotspur and Coventry City. Nicklas Bendtner and Lukas Podolski are in contention to start in the attacking positions, together with Serge Gnabry, while at the back the goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and the full-backs Carl Jenkinson and Nacho Monreal are in line to come in. The midfielder Mathieu Flamini returns from suspension. Wenger said: \"We gave a lot [against United] and certainly for Sunday I will have to make some changes. But still, it's a big game for us and we want to win it.\""}, "isHosted": false}}}
