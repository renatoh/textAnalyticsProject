And why would you need a companion guide? I seem to remember the show, which ran from 1959 to 1973, as a fairly routine soap opera, which could easily be followed without guidance, even if viewed through the wrong side of a balaclava while humming Rosemary Clooney's latest toe-tapper. Bonanza was chiefly famous for its theme tune which went \"dum da da dum da da dum dum Bonanza\", and for the fact that, for unspecified reasons, they used to set fire to a map at the start of the show. It starred Lorne Green, an actor with a dark brown voice and a silvery grey toup\u00e9e, as the patriarch of the Ponderosa Ranch, a widower living with his three sons; one obese, a handsome one always dressed in black, and another I have forgotten. Each week one of them would get into some sort of scrape, but the family would rally round proving that a good, wholesome American family could defeat any kind of evil (code for communism, I suspect, although I missed that at the time). My parents enjoyed the show, ignoring my innuendoes about the boys, who were often to be found in the proximity of pretty girls with pinched waists and neat bosoms, but, like Liberace and Edward Heath, could \"never find the right woman to settle down with\". I perhaps paid more attention to the Bonanza ads than I should have, as they were running in the build-up to the England match on ITV on Friday, and were more interesting than the uncomfortably stilted badinage between the host Adrian Chiles and his pundits. I found myself looking out for that little black and white spinning wheel in the top right-hand corner of the screen, signalling an imminent commercial break, and relief from the tedious pre\u2011match Capello-centric chitty chat. It does not help that Chiles currently has all the relaxed charm of a hostage being forced at gunpoint to make a video asking his relatives to leave a large sum of money in a hollow tree, before they start receiving body parts by registered post. I do not know what has happened to Chiles. Without being funny himself, at his best, on programmes such as The Apprentice: You're Fired!, he engendered an atmosphere of good humour through his ease with live television \u2013 not a skill to be undervalued \u2013 and a certain bluff geniality. On Friday, though \u2013 maybe under the pressure of being chosen to satisfy the overwhelming national desire for a new breakfast TV show \u2013 all that seemed to have disappeared. He was laboured, and actually appeared nervous. While his panel bludgeoned home the familiar complaints about Fabio Capello's tactical intransigence, and inability to connect with some of his players, actually talking at one point about \"losing the dressing room\", the host ploughed his usual West Brom furrow: \"We're rubbish, us, but we'll support us till we die, because that's the kind of wacky folk we are. Back with more after the break.\" Danny Murphy was an addition to the regular punditry duo of Andy Townsend and Gareth Southgate, presumably in a bid to recreate the rapport Chiles used to have with Lee Dixon on Match of the Day 2, but on Friday's evidence that may be some distance away. One further complaint; whoever told ITV that shooting the England manager at a 45 degree angle as if he was Citizen Kane would make his pre-match interview with Gabriel Clarke more interesting, was wrong. Oh, and I am fed up with The Verve, and the \"England band\" endlessly playing Tom Hark and The Great Escape is only marginally less annoying than the vuvuzela. I am conscious of having been something of a crosspatch this week, so allow me to finish by applauding BBC4 for its North of England stuff. Last week the channel, which has lifted television archaeology to new heights, had some magnificent archive programmes about Blackpool; and tomorrow night it does a similar job for another distinctly northern phenomenon, rugby league. There is an exceptional new documentary about Eddie Waring which, while largely sympathetic, explains why Eddie's efforts on behalf of the self\u2011styled Greatest Game were sometimes viewed sceptically on his home turf, a classic cup final from 1978, and a screening of Lindsay Anderson's epoch-making film, This Sporting Life. It is no Bonanza, but it remains the best film about sport you will ever see."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
