Along with his erstwhile defensive partner, Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, Kon\u00e9 was a big reason why Sunderland managed to avoid relegation under Sam Allardyce last season. Now, though, he is high on Everton\u2019s wanted list and Moyes has reluctantly given Kaboul permission to join Watford, with that transfer expected to be finalised shortly. \u201cKon\u00e9 is definitely out of Sunday\u2019s game,\u201d said Moyes, whose injury-hit squad is almost as small as Hull\u2019s before the Wear-Tees derby at home to Middlesbrough. \u201cHe came in this morning and said he has a bad back.\u201d Asked to clarify if Kon\u00e9\u2019s back problem had been confirmed by the club\u2019s medical department, Moyes offered a pointed reply which seemed to endorse suggestions that the Ivory Coast international has, in effect, gone on strike. \u201cHe says he\u2019s got a bad back, he trained yesterday,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve offered him an immediate new contract but his choice is still to go, to leave. He said \u2018no\u2019 to the offer.\u201d Which does not mean Kon\u00e9 will necessarily be leaving the Stadium of Light. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s manager. \u201cBut he\u2019s still got four years remaining on his current contract, so it\u2019s not too big a deal to us. He asked us for a new contract and we offered him that but he turned it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great scenario but the player is ours. I\u2019ve been in situations like this before and the players will go when we tell them to go, not when they want to go.\u201d Even so Sunderland are yet to reject the bid Everton made for Kon\u00e9 almost two weeks ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an offer for him which we haven\u2019t said yes or no to,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see if he\u2019ll still be a Sunderland player on September 1 but my hope would be \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d The Scot has more sympathy for Kaboul. \u201cYoun\u00e8s came to me and said moving to Watford was something he\u2019d like to do for his family; his family home is down there. We spoke about it a couple of times but he was quite keen and, reluctantly, we agreed to it.\u201d Although Moyes \u2013 also without the injured Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole and Seb Larsson on Sunday \u2013 is now working with a worryingly skinny squad, he has at least acquired one new face after the former Everton midfielder, Steven Pienaar, signed a one-year deal. \u201cWe have some difficulties.\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working more hours than is possible because I know we need to get a stronger team and squad before transfer deadline day ends. We need to add players \u2013 and we need to add quality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
