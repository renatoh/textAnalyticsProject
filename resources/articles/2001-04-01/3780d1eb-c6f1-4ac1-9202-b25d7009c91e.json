The band demonstrated their obfuscating diversity in a Prefab Sproutish early number and later reprise, You Can't Have Everything. Under the deft and amusing leadership of Django Bates, the 19-piece orchestra proved that it could and did have it all: boisterous slapstick, precision timing, soaring harmonies, idiosyncrasies and synchronicity. The orchestra's two trombonists staged a delightful moment of argy-bargy in front of the mike, while Swedish vocalist Josefine Cronholm picked her way through the often heaving tempo with grace and determination. Aptly, this 10th birthday celebration for the orchestra was among the first events to be held at London's new venue Ocean, the successor to Stoke Newington's Vortex club where many of the band's musicians met and played for years. Antonio Forcione warmed up the audience on guitar with a solid set that combined rangy blues with Moorish and African-inspired numbers. Often playing unaccompanied, he assembled a colourful collection of effects, turning over the guitar on his knees, sliding it around a little, blowing into the sound-hole, making castanet sounds on the fingerboard and even screeching up the frets as if forcing a recalcitrant zipper. Then Bates, in a powder-blue suit and fish-print T-shirt, used Strauss's Blue Danube as a frame from which to launch a volley of scything horns, marching woodwind and a solo from saxophonist Iain Ballamy. Bates conducted fluidly, keeping balance as if on a rolling ferry. Much of Bates's work has been inspired by the circus, so it's not surprising that at times, as in the romping New York, New York or the renamed Candles Still Flicker, the sound of the Delightful Precipice rampaged through the hall as though all the animals had been let out of their cages at once."}, "isHosted": false}}}
