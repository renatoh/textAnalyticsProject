The move follows a report by the Consumers' Association earlier this year which accused travel agents of overcharging for insurance. A Travelcare spokesman said: 'Travel agents' rates are now clearly seen as uncompetitive.' The price cuts mean that European holiday cover for 14 nights with Travelcare now costs \u00a325, down from \u00a338.95. Travelcare has criticised other travel agents for tempting holidaymakers with free insurance, which it said was likely to be a basic policy with limits to its cover. The company said the public should put 'cover before cost' when buying insurance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
