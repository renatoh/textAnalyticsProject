The me-against-me head-spinnery of Looper? The causation effect flim-flam of The Butterfly Effect? Predestination, a time-travel thriller complete with the traditional sink hole where the plot should be, can cut it any which way you want. It\u2019s free-ranged, grass-fed bull, but wow, can it move fast. Australian brothers Michael and Peter Spierig, working off a short story by American science-fiction writer Robert A Heinlein, adapt a tale of self-destruction that hops back and forth across the decades between the 1930s and the 1990s. Ethan Hawke plays a temporal agent \u2013 a violin case-toting time traveller instructed by his boss (Noah Taylor) to prevent an attack by The Fizzle Bomber, a lunatic who threatens to kill 10,000 people by blowing up a fair-sized chunk of New York. His side quest is the acquisition of a new recruit \u2013 John Doe (Sarah Snook), an individual born intersex who had a child as a woman, then chose to live his life as a man. Snook, a relative newcomer, is a revelation in her role as the damaged and drifting John. After a whizzy intro, the Spierigs entrust the film to her, unspooling her character\u2019s back story through a long bar scene where Hawke\u2019s agent is undercover as the bartender. There\u2019s the occasional flashback, but for the most part it\u2019s Snook\u2019s show. She presents John\u2019s life through the guise of someone who has received the worst the world can deliver. There\u2019s real pain in the story, which sits rather awkwardly beside Hawke\u2019s antics in the film\u2019s second half. Time travel in Predestination is enabled by the agent spinning the dials on his violin case. So there\u2019s many, many shots of Hawke sprinting to band practice through anonymous corridors of the 20th century. We watch him record paranoiac mumblings into a tape recorder, swap clothes to fit the time he\u2019s leapt into. It\u2019s all \u2013 of course \u2013 vital to the story once we get to the big reveal, but unlike, say, 12 Monkeys the individual events don\u2019t make much sense in the run-up, leaving the pay-off feeling a little cheap. The Spierigs take other stylistic cues from Terry Gilliam, particularly in an odd section where John (then Jane) decides to enrol in a government programme that trains women to act as intergalatic courtesans for astronauts in space. The trainees stand in a stark white room wearing futuristic perming machines on their heads. Jane giggles as the machine transmits a video of space flight. One of the other recruits removes her helmet to vom. It\u2019s a weird digression \u2013 transplanted wholesale from Heinlein\u2019s story \u2013 that has little to do with the Spierigs take on the tale. But the wacky space jaunt is a minor stumble. Even if Predestination is distinctive chiefly for Snook\u2019s excellent performance, it\u2019s still a tricksy story well-handled by its directors. It doesn\u2019t offer any new twists on the genre, but it is clever enough to leave you satisfied that you don\u2019t want the time back.
