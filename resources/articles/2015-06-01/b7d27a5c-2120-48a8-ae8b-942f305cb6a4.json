The leading light of the Australian electronic music scene is Flume, born Harley Streten. The 23-year-old\u2019s 2012 self-titled debut album is lush, downtempo but surging electronica and became the signature sound of his homeland the following year, particularly his first anthem Holdin On. Two years on, Streten has toured the world his trademark light-up prism (he now has two: the second one fits into two suitcases), while he\u2019s remixed the likes of Arcade Fire, Sam Smith and Lorde. America is now his second-biggest market after Australia, and he\u2019s considering a temporary relocation to LA as he works on his second album. \u201cSydney\u2019s beautiful, the weather\u2019s great and the air\u2019s fresh and clean, but it doesn\u2019t have the scene and the amount of likeminded people. At home things are very comfortable but I feel like putting myself out there a bit,\u201d he says, munching poached eggs in the lobby of New York\u2019s chic Standard Hotel. On Saturday he plays the Governors Ball in the New York City, one of many festivals he\u2019ll perform at this summer. If festivals are now the places where dance acts and rock bands battle for supremacy, is dance music winning? \u201cYeah,\u201d says Streten with an chuckle at the obviousness of the answer. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more dance festivals than rock.\u201d What\u2019s the most wasted crowd he\u2019s ever encountered? \u201cLeeds \u2013 they were on another planet,\u201d he says. \u201cOh man, they were having a good old time.\u201d A fan of electronic music as a teenager, Streten, from Sydney\u2019s north shore, soon started creating his own tunes: \u201cproper\u201d 130bpm house music and, on the side, more ambient, downtempo material \u201cfor iPod listening on the bus or in the car or at home\u201d. In 2011 he was signed by Aussie dance label Future Classic and soon discovered that it was his more off-kilter material that had the power to excite clubbers. \u201cI don\u2019t think I make dance music,\u201d says Streten. \u201cIt\u2019s not even 4/4. And it\u2019s slow. When it first started happening and I saw people dancing to it I was like, what the fuck? The music I was making for people not to dance to was the one they were dancing to.\u201d Though he admits to an early fondness for the Killers and Bloc Party (\u201cdance music with guitars\u201d), Streten is clear about electronic music\u2019s appeal, both to make and to listen to. \u201cThe thing I find frustrating about rock music is, how different can you make an acoustic drum kit sound, an electric guitar and vocals? It\u2019s very stuck whereas with electronic music new sounds are being created. Imagine a Skrillex bassline 20 years ago \u2013 no-one would have been able to fathom what that sounded like. Great songwriting will never die \u2013 it\u2019s in the DNA of music - but what\u2019s new and exciting is pairing that with new sounds that technology is enabling us to make.\u201d Musicians usually hate describing their own sound, but Streten breaks it down forensically. His aim for album two, he says, is to make \u201cdowntempo, cinematic, really moving pieces but with the energy of EDM. It\u2019s not as easy as you think because when you add energy you take away melody.\u201d Streten often works with vocalists such a fellow Aussie Chet Faker; he\u2019d like to work with Damon Albarn and Andre 3000 and Big Boi of Outkast, whose voices would be suited to his moody sonic palette. Given that he doesn\u2019t even consider what he does to be dance music, Streten is particularly keen not to be lumped in with the crassest end of the genre. \u201cEDM ... I teeter on the edge of that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the new kind of pop I guess. I feel a lot of it doesn\u2019t have a lot of soul, but it gets the kids moving - it does the job.\u201d Rather than, say, David Guetta, Streten prefers the likes of Rustie and Hudson Mohawke to listen to, saying that he was in heaven at Amsterdam\u2019s Pitch festival, when all his favourite musicians were on the bill. He also rates Laneway in Australia and Lightning in a Bottle in the California desert: \u201cIt was quite hippy but well-organised hippy - I would love to go back there as a punter and camp.\u201d As a festival punter, Streten used to \u201cget pretty wasted with my friends\u201d. As a performer, \u201cfestivals don\u2019t have the same charm that they used to because they\u2019re my work environment now\u201d. He does, however, try to see other acts on the bills he plays. \u201cI\u2019ve been really good. The more I tour, the less I party, and the less I party the more I feel I can go and do memorable things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
