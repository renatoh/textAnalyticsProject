In a new drive to try to eliminate unnecessary plastic and packaging, shoppers will be able to fill their own containers with a range of products from a series of dispensers using a dedicated refill station, one of the first to be installed by a major UK supermarket. In a trial starting this week at a Waitrose supermarket in Oxford, customers are being given refillable options for products including wine and beer, rice and cleaning materials, with prices typically 15% cheaper than the packaged alternatives. A standalone pick and mix range of frozen fruit and a borrow-a-box scheme to help carry shopping home are other new retail formats being tested by Waitrose at the Botley Road shop. Waitrose has transformed the store by removing hundreds of products from their packaging, although shoppers will still be able to buy the packaged versions if they wish. Plastic waste has become a major environmental issue, with television programmes such as Blue Planet exposing its detrimental effects on the oceans, and media coverage highlighting the dangers of a global plastic binge. Waitrose is among the UK\u2019s supermarkets which have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact \u2013 an industry-wide initiative to transform packaging and reduce avoidable plastic waste. However, retailers have been criticised for not doing more to tackle the issue at an earlier stage. \u201cThis test has potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for,\u201d said Waitrose\u2019s Tor Harris. Ariana Densham, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThis is a genuinely bold step from Waitrose to trial food dispensers so customers can use refillable tubs and jars. Lots of supermarkets are starting to sell loose fruit and vegetables, but this kind of innovation could spark a refill culture that\u2019s so desperately needed to cut plastics in mainstream shops. \u201cThe top 10 UK supermarkets produce 810,000 tonnes of throwaway packaging each year, so we need to see other major retailers taking plastic reduction seriously and following Waitrose\u2019s lead.\u201d A choice of 160 loose fruit and vegetables will be available, along with four different wines and four beers on tap to be taken home in reusable bottles and nearly 30 products including pasta, rice, grains, couscous, lentils, cereals, dried fruit and seeds available from dispensers. The \u201cunpackaged\u201d model relying on refills has already been adopted by some independent retailers, delicatessens and farm shops but this is the first time it is being used at a national supermarket chain. For the borrow-a-box scheme, customers will pay a \u00a35 deposit which is refundable when the container is returned. A frozen pick and mix section initially selling fruit such as blueberries and mango will encourage shoppers to bring in their own containers. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2019. An earlier version referred to the refill station in Waitrose as the first trial of its kind in a major UK supermarket. That overlooked Morrisons, which has a similar trial in two Yorkshire stores (Guiseley and Skipton), although it has chosen not to publicise these until they have been fully evaluated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
