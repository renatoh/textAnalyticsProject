Clifton Wayne Penny, 28, was tasered while being arrested by police on Armadale Road near the Great Eastern Motor Lodge in Rivervale, southern Perth, on 2 January. He was then arrested and taken to Royal Perth hospital, where he was assessed in the emergency department and released, on 3 January, back into police custody. He was later taken to court, refused bail, and checked into Hakea remand prison, where he was allegedly given a wheelchair because he was unable to walk. Video taken by the prisoner advocate Mervyn Eades at Perth\u2019s Fiona Stanley hospital nine days later, on 11 January, showed Penny\u2019s arms and legs were shaking and his eyes were unfocused. Family who saw Penny on the day of his arrest said he appeared healthy before being taken into hospital. The video, released with Penny\u2019s family\u2019s permission, shows Eades asking: \u201cYou never stopped shaking, uncle?\u201d Penny replies: \u201cNo.\u201d His hands are handcuffed in his lap and the video pans down to show his ankles are chained to the chair. Penny continues: \u201cThey dragged me along the hot concrete \u2026 They dragged me along the hot concrete, stomped on my head and they tasered me until I pissed my pants \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay like this, uncle \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay like this.\u201d A friend who was with Penny at the time of his arrest said he did not appear unwell before police arrived, and showed no sign of tremors. \u201cHe was actually pretty bubbly, he was out there, he was really good,\u201d Jaydan Ballard told Guardian Australia. According to WA police, the Cloverdale man tried to drive away in a stolen Ford Mustang when police found him on 2 January. In a statement, a spokesman from WA police said: \u201cIt will be alleged the man resisted arrest.\u201d Two police officers were injured in the arrest attempt and one later required stitches. \u201cThe man continued to resist arrest and was tasered to prevent further injury to the officers and to apply a set of handcuffs,\u201d the police spokesman said. Ballard watched the arrest from a second-storey window of the Great Eastern Motor Lodge, where she and two others were held by police. She said Penny tried to escape by driving the Mustang away but a police car rammed into the side of the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, pushing it on to the curb. \u201cWhen the car struck on the side to stop him, the police officers dragged him out, and when they dragged him out they started attacking him,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look any more, I was crying, I was upset, I was getting an anxiety attack.\u201d Police said Penny had been taken to Royal Perth hospital on the evening of his arrest and refused bail after appearing at Perth magistrates court the next day, charged with, among a number of other things, obstructing public officers. He attended court in person, from the cells, and did not apply for bail. Guardian Australia understands that if court staff had concerns about his fitness to be in custody at that stage, they would have triggered a mental health assessment. That did not occur. Eades filed a third party complaint with WA Police on Wednesday, alleging that police had stomped on, dragged, and otherwise used excessive force against Penny, and that those actions had at least in part contributed to Penny\u2019s medical condition on 11 January. A spokesman from WA Police said police were required to review all cases where a use of force option, such as a taser, is used, and would conduct a further review after receiving the third party complaint. Representatives from the police Aboriginal liaison division will meet with Penny in jail to see if he wishes to make a formal complaint, which will trigger a full internal investigation involving the interviewing of witnesses. Penny\u2019s great-aunt, who did not wish to be named because she works as a public servant, said it was not clear what had happened to Penny but that he had deteriorated significantly at some point between his arrest on 2 January and the video at Fiona Stanley hospital on 11 January. She has not been able to receive information about his current condition. She told Guardian Australia that neither Royal Perth hospital nor Fiona Stanley hospital could tell her the outcome of Penny\u2019s visits to their respective emergency departments. She said a spokeswoman from Hakea prison told her he had refused treatment. To her knowledge, she said, he did not have any underlying medical conditions. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have cerebral palsy, he doesn\u2019t have Parkinson\u2019s, but that is what it seems like from looking at him,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething has caused him [to have these symptoms].\u201d Penny\u2019s grandfather, who visited him in Hakea after 11 January, said his physical appearance had improved and he was able to walk on his own, but said that he still appeared unfocused and mentally absent. He told Eades that: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s not there no more, inside his own body.\u201d Under Department of Corrective Services protocol, every prisoner receives a medical assessment when they arrive at prison. Penny arrived at Hakea prison on 3 January. A spokesman from the department said it took the health, wellbeing, and privacy of prisoners in its care \u201cvery seriously\u201d. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, the department said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases but that all prisoners who were assessed as needing healthcare when they are checked into custody were put on a case management plan, and that \u201cprisoners requiring secondary or tertiary care are transferred to the nearest hospital.\u201d \u201cWhen medically cleared, prisoners are discharged back to the prison where any follow up care that is required is put in place,\u201d the spokesman said. Medical information can be released if the inmate signs a statutory declaration allowing their family access to their private information, but it\u2019s a lengthy process. Guardian Australia understands the Aboriginal Visitors Scheme has started that process. Eades said he had received permission to visit Penny in his capacity as deputy chairman of the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee of Western Australia on 11 January, and followed the prison van to hospital for Penny\u2019s health check at Fiona Stanley hospital about 2.30pm. He said he had been kicked out of the hospital when prison guards realised he was filming Penny\u2019s condition and has not been told what, if any, diagnosis was made. Eades said Penny claimed he had not received medical treatment at Hakea before that day. \u201cThey gave him a wheelchair at Hakea because he couldn\u2019t walk at all and he constantly had the shakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the Aboriginal boys in Hakea were calling all their families and saying there was something seriously, seriously wrong with him and the message finally got through to me.\u201d Eades said Penny had been fit and healthy before his arrest. \u201cI have known him since he was six years old, he used to play football with my family,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was as fit as a fiddle. He is a solid, healthy boy \u2026 He didn\u2019t have a medical condition at all, he didn\u2019t take any medication.\u201d The Deaths in Custody Watch Committee has reached out to the National Justice Project for assistance in obtaining Penny\u2019s medical records from the department of corrective services. Eades said he had been shocked by these allegations of the use of force against an Indigenous person less than a month after WA police was criticised by the state coroner for the \u201cunprofessional and inhumane\u201d treatment of the Yamatji woman Ms Dhu, who died in police custody in Port Hedland in 2014. He compared it to the 2008 case of Kevin Spratt, who was tasered nine times in a minute in the East Perth watch house after he refused to be strip-searched. The WA police commissioner, Karl O\u2019Callaghan, was criticised for refusing to stand down the two officers involved in tasering Spratt, who were both found guilty of assault in 2014. Fiona Stanley hospital said it was unable to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
