Throughout the week of this 104th Australian Open, the air has been thick enough to make grown men weep as mighty bushfires surround the city like a battalion of angry dragons. Today, though, the atmosphere is fresh and unsullied by smoke, with notes of salt and spume, and hints of Bondi Beach. For Matt Jones, a local from another famous beach in Cronulla, the conditions are as familiar as playing in his backyard with his kids. This is particularly apt because his three kids are here today. Also because he\u2019s a member of this very establishment. Indeed he won this tournament in 2015, and for 17 holes the Stonehaven Cup is effectively his again. Until it isn\u2019t. For hark! Here cometh the indefatigable, gap-toothed terminator of South Africa, Louis Oosthuizen, who stands in the middle of the 17th fairway, 212 metres from the flag, said nor-easter ruffling his right flank. From there the Open champion of 2010 hits a hybrid equal parts sublime and ridiculous - pin-high to a back flag on an upper tier. It\u2019s the perfect shot for the time. It\u2019s impossible for we mug amateurs to even conceive of the thing. It\u2019s the mark of a champion. Yet Jones is three shots clear, and surely sweet. He\u2019s birdied 17 as he birdied five, eight, 13 and 14. He\u2019s led from the get-go and all day without fuss. He\u2019s hit fairways and greens, and dozens of pure, military golf shots. Oosthuizen, cherubic features belying the inner steel of the ultra-competitive pro sportsman, rolls in the 15-foot putt for the eagle and Jones\u2019s lead is cut to one. He needs par on 18 to win. It should be easy: drive, wedge, wedge, two putts, kiss the kids. But the 72nd hole of your national championship doesn\u2019t play as easily in real life as it does upon the digits of this electronic medium. Jones pulls his drive left into a fairway bunker halfway between 10 and 18; behind a tree. He chops out sideways, clips a branch, and his ball lands in a pile of pine straw. Not ideal. Jones aims a mid-iron at the left trap and ends up short. He then waits an age for Cameron Tringale to chop out of the sand before ripping off what amateurs, again, would consider impossible: tight lie, wedge over a bunker, Australian Open on the line. Jones makes it look easy. The ball pitches, checks slightly and releases to five feet. It is not easy. Jones waits another age for Tringale and Japanese amateur Takumi Kanaya to putt out. It\u2019s more than a koala fleeing a bushfire can bear. Jones scans from hole to ball and quickly sets it free. The putt threatens to hook out on the low side but drops in the left edge, and Jones joins such worthies as Greg Norman, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as multiple Australian Open champions. Jones\u2019s round began with a leaderboard as cosmopolitan as a summit of the Five Eyes alliance. There was the Australia of Jones and Marc Leishman. Tringale was on a mission from Mission Viejo in California. There was the wunderkind from Japan, 21-year-old Kanaya. Oosthuizen, as they say, would not go away. And there was Paul Casey, the world number 14 who declared after shooting 68-65-71 that he would quite like to win the tournament if it didn\u2019t put anyone out, or words to that effect in his nice English way. The Australian Golf Club isn\u2019t nice, it\u2019s spectacular; a championship layout manicured within an inch of its life and watered at night by high society money. It\u2019s Santa Ana couch fairways are tight and fine, and cut to 10 millimetres. Its bentgrass greens are rolled hard like billiard tables. Swaley and sweet, they run 11.5 on the Stimpmeter. By the final group\u2019s seventh hole the nor-easter kicked up a gear. The knock on Jones from assorted beard-strokers in golf\u2019s pro ranks and punditry is that he couldn\u2019t go up a gear if required. That he\u2019s good enough to get ahead and lead but that he doesn\u2019t possess \u2018the game\u2019 to kick away. That he could not weather the likes of Oosthuizen\u2019s charge. That when the pressure comes from the panting pack, Matt Jones just continues to be Matt Jones \u2013 fairways, greens, putt, repeat. But weather this charge he did. He didn\u2019t need to go up a gear. Conditions kept other bastards honest. The margin for error was tiny. Only Oosthuizen continued to play implacably in a zone of ultra-competition. Errors were made by everyone else. Jones, meanwhile, was cuddling his kids between tee and green. On the 10th he hit a seven-iron 150m uphill from a bunker, sticking it pin high. It looked easy. But there\u2019s the rub, and the beauty of Jones\u2019s golf \u2013 it was ridiculously good. The Stonehaven Cup has a worthy champion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
