Are they being swindled?", "bodyText": "Customers stream into the parking lot of a San Diego strip mall, lining up behind a windmill-shaped vending machine that fills their jugs for 25 to 35 cents a gallon. \u201cThe water that comes from the tap, I don\u2019t trust it, and it doesn\u2019t taste good,\u201d Miguel Martinez said on a recent afternoon, as he filled his bottle from the kiosk. Martinez lives in San Diego\u2019s nearby Shelltown neighborhood, an area located minutes from downtown where many immigrant families have landed. \u201cGood water right here,\u201d his friend says, patting the machine. Martinez says he doesn\u2019t mind paying a little extra money for what he believes is premium water that tastes better than what comes from his home faucet. It\u2019s a steal compared with the individually sealed bottles you can buy at the store, he said. \u201cI never drink tap water,\u201d Eddie, a different customer who declined to give his last name, said in Spanish. He got used to buying bottled water 15 years ago when he lived in Mexico and never went back to tap water. Eddie, who works in construction, said when he is at home he drinks sealed water bottles he buys from the store, but he keeps the three-gallon jugs he fills up at the kiosks when he goes to work. \u201cEven if they say the tap water is safe, how do we [know] it\u2019s true?\u201d he said. Water vending machines have become a common feature in southern California. They\u2019re not new \u2013 the state\u2019s department of public health has licensed them since 1989 \u2013 and at first glance, they seem to offer a solution for California\u2019s struggle to provide clean drinking water for all of its residents. Customers even swear by the improved taste and believe it is safer than tap water, even if there is not much evidence that they\u2019re getting the quality they\u2019re paying for. Water vending wars There are about 9,200 water vending machines clustered throughout California, according to the state\u2019s public health department, which regulates the machines. The majority \u2013 55% \u2013 are located in southern California, in the state\u2019s five most populous counties: Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange. The kiosks take city tap water \u2013 which must be clean enough to meet state and federal quality standards \u2013 run it through a filtration system that removes chemicals such as chlorine to improve taste, then dispense it to customers at an 8,000% to 10,000% mark-up. Vended water is cheaper than individually sealed, store-bought bottles, but many times more expensive than tap water. The public health department requires water vending operators to inspect, clean and sanitize machines once a month, and list the last date of service on the machine. But records suggest that the department has been lax in regulating the industry and double-checking the vending machines. When the investigative news outlet Voice of San Diego dug into the issue earlier this year, it found that in 2015, the department only inspected two of the 1,100 machines in San Diego county, for example. Midway through 2019, it hadn\u2019t inspected any. A spokesperson for the public health department told the Guardian statewide data for this year was not immediately available. In the past, water and public health officials have raised concerns over the machines\u2019 safety when they are not properly regulated. In 1997, when the public health department still relied on water vending operators to inspect their own machines, the environmental toxicology bureau in Los Angeles county found that the dispensers located in southern California supermarkets had higher levels of bacteria than plain tap water \u2013 probably related to old filters or dirty spigots on the machines. \u201cYou\u2019re safer drinking the tap water,\u201d a water official said at the time. \u201cNot only are you safer, but you\u2019re paying, oh, let\u2019s see, about 250 times less per gallon.\u201d A few years later, a study by the not-for-profit Environmental Working Group found that water from two-thirds of the machines they tested in California, owned by the then industry leader, Glacier Water, did not match its marketing claims in terms of contaminants. California\u2019s vended water market is dominated by Primo water, which purchased Glacier Water in 2016 and owns 85% of the vended water kiosks in California. At the time of its merger, Primo said the acquisition gave it 46,000 retail locations in the US and Canada. Today Primo is valued at $400m. Vending machine companies usually offer a cut of their sales and possibly a signing bonus to stores that allow them to use their space. The market is so profitable it has sparked ugly turf wars between water companies competing for the coveted space in front of stores. About seven years ago, one vending machine company, Mountain\u2019s Peak, filed a complaint against Glacier and accused it of threatening and pressuring store owners to sign contracts with Glacier. Glacier, in turn, accused Mountain Peak of benefiting from a plot to sabotage its machines and steal business. The two companies eventually settled and agreed not to tamper with each other\u2019s machines. \u201cIt\u2019s really a nasty business. It\u2019s not a gentleman\u2019s business,\u201d Ed Rose, an attorney who represented Mountain\u2019s Peak, told Voice of San Diego this year. \u2018It is cynical and exploitative\u2019 The concerns raised over lax regulation don\u2019t seem to matter to the dozens of customers who line up to fetch water from the machines \u2013 many of them located in front of liquor stores and strip malls in low-income neighborhoods and immigrant communities. Watermill Express, which operates the windmill-shaped water kiosks, did not respond to questions from the Guardian. But when asked in 2015 why so many kiosks were found in low-income neighborhoods, Lani Dolifka, the Watermill co-founder, told Fast Company that \u201cbudget conscious\u201d clientele deserve options, too. \u201cNot everyone can afford to buy bottled water or have a water delivery service, but everyone needs access to safe, affordable, pure drinking water,\u201d she said. Debi Ores, a senior attorney with the Community Water Center, a not-for-profit organization that works to improve access to clean water for residents in central California, said the distrust of tap water is understandable for immigrants who come from countries without clean drinking water. \u201cIf the water looks or smells a little funny, they might not have faith that the water is safe to drink. Especially if they\u2019ve known people or had family members who\u2019ve gotten sick from drinking the water.\u201d But the Environmental Working Group, which researches environmental issues, took a sharper view of the marketing in a 2002 report. At the time, it said the then industry leader, Glacier, was exploiting immigrants\u2019 fear of tap water in order to turn a profit. Glacier at the time estimated that 60% of its market in California came from Latino and Asian customers. \u201cOn the surface, the targeting of recent immigrants may seem like smart niche marketing. But on closer examination, it is cynical and exploitative,\u201d the report read. \u201cGlacier\u2019s marketing strategy takes advantage of the fact that new arrivals, many of whom have limited English skills, may not know that California tap water is safer than the water back home. Then it charges people who can least afford it an inflated price for a basic necessity.\u201d Neither Primo nor Watermill Express responded to multiple phone calls and emails from the Guardian. Questions over marketing aside, residents could be forgiven for not trusting the contents of their tap water. In recent years, California schools have been scrutinized for providing drinking water with high concentrations of lead \u2013 contamination that can happen when ageing pipes leach lead into the water before it leaves the faucet, said Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist with EWG. \u201cThere\u2019s really no safe levels of lead, especially for children,\u201d Temkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a problem with the quality of the water that the utility is providing, but what\u2019s coming out in the back end,\u201d she said. In a school less than two miles away from where Eddie and Martinez filled up their jugs, officials were alerted to contaminated water after a therapy dog reportedly refused to drink. When officials tested the water they found lead as well as a chemical that came from plastic pipes. It was probably the reason the school nurse reported that students vomited after drinking the water. More than schools are at risk, though; homes in low-income communities are particularly prone to contamination tied to ageing infrastructure and lax monitoring standards, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \u2018Not a great solution\u2019 Anxiety over having enough clean water has loomed over California for years. Panic set in four years ago after a winter of unusually low snowfall, which the state relies on to refill water reservoirs, exacerbated drought conditions. Cities began issuing water restrictions, but by May of that year nearly 2,000 wells had run dry, leaving some communities without water. The seven-year drought officially ended this year, but the dry stretch highlighted the precarious nature of water in California. Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million residents in California still go without clean water, many of them in the Central Valley, the state\u2019s agricultural hub, which produces a quarter of the nation\u2019s produce. Water vending machines may seem like an appropriate response to providing clean water for communities that struggle to provide it. But experts and advocates list a number of reasons why vended water falls short as a solution and may even further strain the residents who most need it. While the majority of water kiosks are found in southern California, the regions that accrued the most violations for contaminated drinking water are located north of Los Angeles, in less populous areas of the state, according to EWG\u2019s tap water database, which includes enforcement and compliance related information. And the fact that the kiosks typically need a water supply that already meets federal and state standards means the machines wouldn\u2019t work for areas where clean water is most scarce \u2013 places such as the San Joaquin Valley, which Jonathan London, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, has studied extensively. Vended water could help some, but it also imposes additional burdens on families, London said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great solution, long-term,\u201d London said. \u201cThe vending machines unfortunately are not well-regulated.\u201d A lot of the people who are dependent on vended water don\u2019t have cars, so it is hard for them to actually access it, he said. And buying filtered water, on top of the water coming through their pipes, puts an extra financial burden on low-income families and cuts into their monthly income, he said. London and Ores instead favor longer-term solutions, like getting more residents off private-well water and on to public water systems of larger jurisdictions, which have more resources to treat and monitor water. The Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, linked to legislation the California governor, Gavin Newsom, signed this year, could provide some relief. The plan allocates up to $130m a year to help cash-strapped districts improve access to clean water. Ores said it was a step toward sustainability and providing people the clean water they are entitled to. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with communities that pay up to 10% of their monthly income on water,\u201d she said, referring to places where people pay for vended or bottled water on top of what they spend on the unclean water pumped into their homes. \u201cPeople are spending a huge part of their income just on a basic human right.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
