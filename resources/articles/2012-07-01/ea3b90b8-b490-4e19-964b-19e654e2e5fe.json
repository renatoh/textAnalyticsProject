Key rival Misha Aloyan (Russia) Medal prediction Gold Luke Campbell Bantam 56kg Hailing from Hull, Campbell won silver at the 2011 World Championships and in 2008 was the first GB boxer since 1961 to become European champion. After a run of 23 unbeaten fights two years ago, Rob McCracken, the GB performance director, described Campbell, 22, as the \"benchmark\" for his squad. Campbell began boxing at 13 and is now ranked third in the world by AIBA. Key rival L\u00e1zaro Alvarez Estrada (Cuba) Medal prediction Bronze Josh Taylor Light 60kg Taylor, who is from Edinburgh, is Scotland's sole representative in the GB men's squad. A former junior taekwondo champion, the 21-year-old was the 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medallist at lightweight before making an unsuccessful move up a division last year. After dropping back to 60kg \u2013 and adopting a specifically tailored diet to maintain the weight \u2013 he secured a place at London 2012, but Taylor is not expected to medal. Key rival Fatih Keles (Turkey) Medal prediction Quarter-finals Tom Stalker Light welter 64kg The 2010 BOA Olympic Athlete of the Year is the reigning Commonwealth Games champion and a double European silver medallist who started boxing at Liverpool's St Aloysius gym at the relatively late age of 18. Stalker, 26, was denied a place at the 2008 Beijing Olympics by Frankie Gavin, England's inaugural world champion, who then failed to make the weight for the Games. Is ranked world No1 by AIBA. Key rival Munkh-Erdene Uranchimeg (Mongolia) Medal prediction Gold Fred Evans Welter 69kg The reigning Commonwealth Games champion, 18-year-old Evans, from Cardiff, joined Selby in becoming the first Welshmen for 86 years to become a European champion when defeating Mahamed Nurudzinau of Belarus last year. Despite reaching only the final eight of November's World Championships in Azerbaijan, AIBA rank him as second in the world behind Taras Shelestyuk. Key rival Taras Shelestyuk (Ukraine) Medal prediction Silver Anthony Ogogo Middle 75kg The 24-year-old from Lowestoft has modelled for Adidas and Subway and in 2008 appeared in Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack. Suffered a shoulder injury that caused an absence of 12 months but recovered to win silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. A further shoulder problem hindered his preparations for the final Olympic qualifier in Turkey in April, but he showed spirit to win from six points down in the quarter-finals and go on to secure a place at the Games. Key rival Abdelmalek Rahou (Algeria) Medal prediction Quarter-finals Anthony Joshua Super heavy 91kg Ranked third in the world by AIBA, Joshua defeated reigning Olympic and double world champion Roberto Cammarelle at November's World Championships in Azerbaijan en route to a final he was unlucky to lose to local fighter Magomedrasul Medzhidov. The 22-year-old cites his suspension from the GB team in early 2011 for drug possession as \"100%\" a positive learning experience. Is favourite for gold. Key rival Roberto Cammarelle (Italy) Medal prediction Gold Nicola Adams Fly 51kg Adams is a slick and classy boxer who became the first British woman to win a major title at the 2011 European Championships, and has finished runner-up at the World Championships three times. She beat the current world No1 Cancan Ren earlier this year before losing to her in the finals at the worlds in China. It is bound to be close if the pair meet in London, but home advantage could make the difference. Key rival Cancan Ren (China) Medal prediction Gold Natasha Jonas Light 60kg Was one of three girls fighting for a place in the Team GB team going into 2012 but a series of strong performances, culminating in a bronze medal at the World Championships in May, booked her place at the Games. Outside the ring she is sassy and witty; in it she is improving rapidly. But Ireland's Katie Taylor, who has won four successive world titles, looks unstoppable. Key rival Katie Taylor (Ireland) Medal prediction Bronze Savannah Marshall Middle 75kg Marshall certainly had a 21st birthday to remember, becoming the first British female to win World Championship gold earlier this year. She went up to 75kg in 2010 after hearing there would be no 69kg category at the Games, but is lighter on her feet at the heavier weight class, the result of sparring with fighters in the men's team. Possesses an excellent double jab and goes into London as one of the favourites. Key rival Elena Vystropova (Azerbaijan) Medal prediction Silver"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
