Unless your surname has a hyphen in it, or a wealthy relative helpfully expires, or you\u2019ve been saving for so long you\u2019ve literally forgotten what smiling feels like, you\u2019re probably never going to be able to afford a home without at least one irritating housemate in it. Thanks, baby boomers: because of you, flatsharing well into our fourth decade is a glum reality for many of us, now, and probably for ever. This sad turn of events gives Men Behaving Badly, the Ronseal-titled sitcom that was a minor phenomenon between 1992 and 1998, an odd sort of timelessness. Martin Clunes is Gary, a sad sack whose life amounts to a steady yet stultifying job and a half-arsed relationship with Caroline Quentin\u2019s Dorothy, a nurse who still lives with her parents, and remains with Gary \u2013 as far as we can tell \u2013 because it\u2019s easier than breaking up with him. In the flat upstairs lives Deborah, played with perfect holier-than-thou-edness by Leslie Ash. And in Gary\u2019s spare room dwells a lodger: Harry Enfield\u2019s Dermot in the feet-finding first series, and Neil Morrissey\u2019s affable dimbulb Tony from series two onwards. Gary and Dorothy\u2019s relationship is fractious, and Tony has a crush on Deb. They drink, they argue, they take the piss out of each other. No one really knows what to do with their lives. Replace the adorably 90s names with modern ones \u2013 probably Sansa or Cillian or something \u2013 and the setup is basically every reluctant, fiscally motivated houseshare today. Sure, it\u2019s definitely of its time. The amount of smoking indoors seems like madness, at least to anyone whose curtains don\u2019t smell like Keith Richards\u2019s lapels. And while Gary and Tony hardly represent \u201cOi oi, go on the Reds!\u201d mid-90s \u201cnew lad\u201d culture, their drunken knobheaddery was a definite stepping stone towards it. Stella was imbibed in industrial weights. Chats about which ladies\u2019 bottom was nicest were had. And the whole women-as-killjoys angle looks odd in hindsight, particularly considering Absolutely Fabulous \u2013 Women Behaving Badly in all but name \u2013 was on at the same time. Through it all, though, the central bromance between Gary and Tony lifted everything; part adorable, part sad, each slurred conversation a hilarious, wonderfully written window into the male psyche. Through ill-advised raves, DIY dentistry, barbecue catastrophes, rubbish jobs, breakups and flings, Gary and Tony were best mates. Until Tony and Dorothy slept together. Yep, that\u2019s right. Late in series four, Gary was away and his best mate and his girlfriend boffed. It wasn\u2019t Dorothy\u2019s betrayal that irked (Gary had tried, was currently trying to, and later succeeded in, cheating on Dorothy, so he had it coming) but dense, faithful Tony\u2019s. Like a flatshare couch your housemate has done a shag on, their relationship was tarnished for ever. The show trundled merrily on for another two series and a few specials, but something wasn\u2019t quite right. When Debs and Tony finally got together, it was definitely time for the men to start behaving and grow up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
