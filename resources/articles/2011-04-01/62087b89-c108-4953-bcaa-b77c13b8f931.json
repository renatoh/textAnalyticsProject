So limited are the English language skills of the young French jockey Mickael Barzalona that Cooper has been helping out as his translator for trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni and even the press. Instructions must have been passed from Al-Zarooni correctly as he won on two of his three rides at Newmarket, and on Saturday impressed when lifting the 25-runner Spring Mile at Newbury on 14-1 shot Light From Mars. Barzalona's first trip to Britain had, however, got off a bad start when the 19-year-old lost his luggage en route and had to borrow a full set of clothes, as well as riding gear, from other jockeys. He was spotted wearing boots marked \"Peslier\" when riding at the track on Thursday. Bad publicity at Plumpton Hannah Grissell, a PR executive for Racing For Change as well as a 7lb-claiming amateur rider, may need to open the minds of a few dinosaurs in the weighing room as well as convincing the racing public in her day job. Grissell, the daughter of trainers Gardie and Diana, had a depressing afternoon at Plumpton on Monday when she had to pull up her horse Downe Payment in a handicap hurdle. \"Average day at Plumpton,\" she tweeted. \"Got abused by the other jockeys at the start for basically being female, then my horse broke a blood vessel.\" Wedding bells for Elliott and Maguire Co Meath trainer Gordon Elliott was the first person to greet the winning jockey, Jason Maguire, after Ballabriggs' success in the Grand National last Saturday. Elliott, who trained the 2007 National winner, Silver Birch, was out of luck with his runner Backstage in the big race, but was still delighted by the result. \"I was as pleased for Jason to win as I would have been if we'd won,\" said Elliott. \"He's been my best friend since we were at school together and he's going to be my best man and I'm his at our weddings this year.\" Don't you know who I am? The Scottish Grand National meeting at Ayr did not begin on a good note for the Channel 4 racing presenter Derek Thompson. Newmarket-based \"Tommo\" was due to fly to Prestwick to cover the meeting only to find he had forgotten his passport when arriving at Stansted airport. A very long drive to Scotland followed. His Channel 4 colleague Emma Spencer also found herself in the wars on the way to working at Newbury and was spotted walking to the racecourse on foot after having to leave her damaged car at a nearby garage. First past the post? Sandown Park racecourse has opened a public vote offering racing fans the opportunity to choose the winner of two awards, the People's Jumps Season Award and Jump Racing's Horse of the Year Award, to be presented before racing on bet365 Gold Cup Day on Saturday. Voting closes on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
