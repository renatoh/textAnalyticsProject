The Algeria striker wants to score the goals needed to keep Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side in the Premier League, turn his current loan arrangement from Leicester City into a formal transfer and wear his new club\u2019s famous No 9 shirt. For the moment Slimani is content with the No 13 he also sports for Algeria but a forward hoping to overcome a thigh strain in time to make his debut at home to Manchester United on Sunday has different long-term plans. \u201cI feel most comfortable in the No 9 shirt so why not in the future here?\u201d said Leicester\u2019s record \u00a328m signing who nonetheless failed to eclipse, let alone displace, Jamie Vardy in the east Midlands. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy if I could stay here longer. My objective is to score goals here. I already knew a lot about Newcastle and about Alan Shearer. It\u2019s a great club, a very famous club, renowned around the world. I\u2019m happy to be here. \u201cThe big difference between Newcastle and Leicester is that Rafa Ben\u00edtez trusts me and having the trust of your coach is very important. Before I joined, Rafa phoned me, we had a good chat and there was a good feeling between us. It\u2019s important to get a call like this, to know you\u2019re wanted by a big coach like him. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about a lot of topics, many, many subjects.\u201d Now Slimani needs to repay Ben\u00edtez\u2019s faith by proving himself on the pitch. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d said the 29-year-old. \u201cI hope I can show what I\u2019m capable of. At Leicester it was always about injuries but I\u2019m here to give my best fight to the team. My aim is to give 100%every single match. \u201cI wanted to leave Leicester, I needed a fresh start, Newcastle\u2019s a big club and it\u2019s a good choice for me. A lot of clubs got in touch but I\u2019m pretty sure I made the right choice.\u201d He would not be drawn as to whether his friend and compatriot Riyad Mahrez was correct to go on strike at Leicester after the Algeria playmaker\u2019s longed for deadline day transfer to Manchester City fell through at the 11th hour. \u201cRiyad\u2019s an adult, he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Slimani. \u201cWe talk but he\u2019s my friend so what we say is personal and confidential.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
