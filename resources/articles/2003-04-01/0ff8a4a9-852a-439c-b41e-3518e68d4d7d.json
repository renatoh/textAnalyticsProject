Although Sun owner News International refused to comment on when it would increase its price from the current 25p in most regions, analysts expected it to do so soon, after the Mirror blinked first in the price battle. \"There's no reason to prolong the pain unless you have to,\" said Simon Baker, media analyst at SG Securities, told Reuters. The Daily Mirror, which began a fierce round of price cutting last May when it dropped its price to 20p, yesterday returned to a cover price of 32p across the country. Arch rival the Sun retaliated by cutting its price to 10p in some regions. The strategy was criticised by analysts who thought it was madness to take on Rupert Murdoch's News International in a price war. Despite the price cuts, the Mirror's circulation fell by 3.4% over the year. \"The price war was a muddled strategy in that it coincided with an attempt to be taken more seriously,\" said Simon Lapthorne, analyst at Arbuthnot Securities. Trinity Mirror chief executive Sly Bailey presaged the price rise last month during her first results briefing. \"While I would not hesitate to use price tactically in the right situation, I'm not a fan of price wars. If you look across the industry prices are rising and I'm very encouraged by what I see,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
