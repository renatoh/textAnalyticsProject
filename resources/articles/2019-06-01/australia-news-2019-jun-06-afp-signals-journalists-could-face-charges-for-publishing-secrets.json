The acting AFP commissioner, Neil Gaughan, held a press conference on Thursday to contain political fallout, denying suggestions the police had waited until after the federal election to execute warrants and claiming no contact had been made with the executive since they informed home affairs minister Peter Dutton\u2019s office when the investigations started. Gaughan revealed the investigation into the ABC\u2019s report of alleged unlawful killings by Australian troops in Afghanistan began in July 2017 and the investigation into Annika Smethurst\u2019s report of plans to extend powers to spy on Australian citizens began in April 2018 after complaints from relevant department heads. Gaughan said that \u201cneither the government nor any minister has directed the actions of these investigations\u201d. He said the police had no contact with the minister or other members of the executive since Dutton\u2019s office was notified, a \u201cstandard practice\u201d at the start of politically sensitive investigations. Gaughan said the AFP is a \u201cstrong supporter of press freedom\u201d but, in a pointed warning, said that \u201cno sector of the community should be immune\u201d from police investigations into alleged law-breaking, including the execution of warrants. The AFP have said they are investigating breaches of part 6 of the Crimes Act, which criminalises unauthorised disclosures by public servants, and part 7, which contains offences which can apply to journalists including receiving or publishing \u201cofficial secrets\u201d. Gaughan said the police are investigating the fact that documents marked \u201csecret\u201d and \u201ctop secret\u201d were published, confirming that \u201cit is an offence to actually have that particular material still on websites\u201d \u2013 putting journalists squarely in the frame of potential prosecutions. He said the fact the documents were published set the two cases \u201cabove others\u201d in the scale of the alleged national security breach. But, asked what the harm of revealing alleged wrongdoing by Australian troops or plans to extend spying laws was, Gaughan said the substance of the reports was \u201cirrelevant\u201d and that the mere fact of disclosure of protected information was a crime. \u201cThe issue of whether or not the public has the right to know is really not an issue that comes into our investigation process,\u201d he said. Gaughan said police don\u2019t judge whether a complaint was a \u201cgood referral or bad referral\u201d but had concluded it was deemed \u201clikely\u201d that offences had been committed. Gaughan held out hope that the public interest could be considered at a later stage, noting that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions could decline to prosecute or judges could consider it as part of a defence. Gaughan said the police get \u201cnumerous\u201d referrals about alleged leaks \u2013 \u201ctoo many\u201d, in his words - but took these matters seriously in part to ensure the \u201cinternational community knows that we take the leaking of sensitive information seriously\u201d. Despite a litany of complaints about alleged leaks, the matters rarely proceed to prosecution, with the pending prosecution of the Afghan files whistleblower former defence lawyer David McBride a notable exception. Critics of the raids include the opposition Labor, Greens and Centre Alliance parties, who have complained of a double standard. They say leaks of material advantageous to the government are not pursued while leaks relating to alleged misconduct of significant public interest are pursued due to embarrassment of the government and security agencies. On Thursday, Labor demanded an explanation for the recent raids, warning that the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Dutton could not \u201chide behind\u201d police because the investigations were initiated by referrals from the government. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, accused the prime minister of \u201chollow words\u201d by claiming to believe in press freedom but refusing to explain the \u201cextraordinary\u201d raids which targeted Smethurst in her home and the ABC. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, offered the government bipartisan support if it chose to review national security laws. So far Morrison has reasserted that the raids occurred at arm\u2019s length from the government and suggested he is \u201copen to discussing\u201d concerns about security laws\u2019 impact on the press. Keneally told reporters in Melbourne if there was \u201csome suggestion\u201d that national security laws could be reviewed, Morrison should work with Labor \u201cin a bipartisan fashion\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon all of us in the parliament to uphold democratic freedoms, to uphold trust in the community. \u201cBut the government of the day is the Morrison government and they need to stand up, speak on this issue; if they want to work with us on this, I say the door is open.\u201d The police union, meanwhile, has urged the public to recognise officers were simply doing their job and \u201cdoing it professionally\u201d. The Australian Federal Police Association president, Angela Smith, said she was proud of the AFP officers had executed the warrants while under intense media scrutiny. \u201cThe community needs to remember that the officers are doing their job and they are doing it professionally,\u201d Smith said. \u201cGiven the media attention directed at the officers, including the disclosure of the name of the search warrant holder by the ABC, they have performed extremely well and conducted themselves with integrity and professionalism and I congratulate them on that.\u201d with Christopher Knaus"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
