In Japan, sales of new vehicles slumped by 22% last month to their lowest ever December total, while French sales were down almost 16% as the impact of the credit crunch continues to bite. Across the Atlantic, Ford disclosed that it sold 32% fewer cars in December than it did a year earlier. While purchases by individual customers were down by 27%, the number of vehicles sold to fleet buyers such as rental agencies and hospitality businesses plummeted by 42%. Its rival Chrysler reported even worse December sales, plunging by 53%, while General Motors saw a 31% decline. Foreign manufacturers also fared badly in the US market with Toyota sales down 37% in December, Honda down 35% and Nissan down 31%. The car website Edmunds.com predicted sales for the full year will total just over 13m, down 18% from 2007 and the lowest level since 1992. Latest sales figures for the UK are due to be published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on Wednesday and will make grim reading. \"The outlook for the auto industry is becoming increasingly bleak heading into 2009 as car companies and sales operations wrestle with the issues of the evaporation of consumer demand as the full extent of the financial crisis hits the industry,\" according to Paul Newton, motor industry analyst at Global Insight. The fall in French car sales follows poor numbers from Italy, Belgium and Spain last week. Global Insight now expects sales for the western European market to be below 14m for 2008 and is projecting a further fall in 2009 to just 12.5m. Wednesday's SMMT figures are likely to increase the urgency of talks between the government and the UK motor industry over help in the current crisis. Industry sources insist companies are not looking for a \"bail-out\" but believe the government could help increase the availability of credit to keep the market moving. Today Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of Unite, repeated earlier calls for the government to get involved. \"Now is the moment for Gordon Brown to be bold and give our car industry the sort of backing already offered to the financial services and construction sectors \u2013 backing it would never get from do-nothing free-market Tories. \"One lesson of this crisis is that Britain needs a strong manufacturing sector. Over-reliance on finance has got us into this mess \u2013 let's give the car industry the chance to help us get out of it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
