Celtic's supporters would be satisfied with the goal from Craig Beattie that extended their advantage over Rangers in the league table to 22 points, but those who followed Hibernian would be at least mildly shocked by the abnormally cautious play of their team and the ordering...#8209;off of substitute Ivan Sproule late in the match. Hibs' intention to place the emphasis on containment was obvious. Manager John Collins deployed them in a 4-5-1 formation, with Steven Fletcher the striker and Scott Brown moved from his usual place wide on the right into the centre of midfield. This departure from the Easter Road side's well-established, and much-admired, aggressive style predictably allowed Celtic the bulk of possession, but for long periods it was in areas from which they would have difficulty in troubling young Andrew McNeil in the visitors' goal. The more conservative approach may have been partly forced on Collins by the absence of one or two regular, first-choice picks, but there would also be a strong element of calculation, one that would let the champions know they would have to work hard to earn the space in which to create scoring opportunities. Curiously, Kenny Miller had a chance to catch Hibs cold only a few seconds after the kick-off, Paul Hartley's through pass sending the striker clear on the right. But the chance was lost when he was forced to check by the posse of backtracking defenders and the cross was blocked. Miller also headed wide from Mark Wilson's accurate cross from the right, the full-back having been supplied by Shunsuke Nakamura, but, during a first half that could be described as studied rather than adventurous, these were isolated incidents. Hibs' reliance on trying to exploit space on the counter-thrust threatened to be rewarded only once during the 45 minutes, when Kevin McCann, with a pass from his own defensive area, released Guillaume Beuzelin straight through the middle. Lacking the pace to carry the ball into the penalty area as opponents closed in, the French midfielder shot early and pulled the low drive wide. But Beuzelin and, within a short time, Sean Lynch would cause genuine scares with powerful attempts just before the interval. Both these beautifully controlled drives from just outside the area would have counted but for important saves by Artur Boruc. Yet, having come so close to leading, it seemed almost inevitable that it would be Hibs who would fall behind, a suspicion that was vindicated early in the second half. Celtic's ambition was undimmed, but it was complemented in the time that preceded the goal by more incisiveness in the vicinity of McNeil. The feeling had grown that they would be rewarded by the time Stephen McManus supplied Aiden McGeady on the left. The right-footed centre from the Republic of Ireland midfielder was impeccable, allowing Beattie to meet the ball flush on the forehead and send a powerful header past McNeil from only six yards. Collins had already replaced Michael Stewart - struggling with injury - with Sproule, but the goal brought another unsurprising alteration when Abdessalam Benjelloun took over from young Sean Lynch, Hibs switching from 4-5-1 to what would be, in effect, a 4-3-3. This may have given them a more aggressive look, but they seemed to enjoy the benefit of referee Stuart Dougal's generosity when Miller, surging into the penalty area and on the point of shooting, appeared to be the victim of a compound foul, taken down by the combined efforts of Chris Hogg and Shelton Martis. The visitors, however, may have been rather harshly punished by the dismissal of Sproule. The substitute's charge at Lee Naylor was reckless but hardly life-threatening and, on another day, might have attracted only a yellow card."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
