England play Norway in a friendly on Tuesday night, following a 3-3 draw in Belgium on Thursday, and Moore has been forced to withdraw from the camp having picked up a thigh injury. With the opening weekend of the Barclays FA WSL on 7\u20118 September, just days after players return from international duties in Euro 2021 qualifiers and friendlies, there is little time for clubs to ready their senior internationals for the new campaign. \u201cI think we have something like five players next week that are left behind,\u201d said Moore. \u201cWhat are they [Reading\u2019s coaches] meant to do with five players? We definitely look at it and go \u2018it\u2019s just bad timing\u2019. You want consistency with your club and you go away with England, have a little break and play a different formation, play slightly differently. Then you get dropped back in the club. We play Tuesday, arrive back Wednesday, probably have Thursday off. So I\u2019ll be in Reading on Friday, and Saturday, then the game, the first game of the season. Two days preparation.\u201d With the international calendar set by Fifa and the FA juggling the women\u2019s domestic schedule the task of making all competitions fit together is complex. Moore, though, cannot understand how with fewer teams in the league than the Premier League, meaning fewer games, there is such a struggle to fit everything in. \u201cI don\u2019t know who does the league or how they plan it out but I never understand how we don\u2019t have enough weeks in the year to play a game a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s just me. I actually really like playing midweek because it breaks my training week up, it doesn\u2019t make it so monotonous. But I don\u2019t get why we cram games in. And I do get the \u2018well, you\u2019ve got a good squad, you\u2019ve got enough money etc, like, that\u2019s the way football is going to go\u2019 argument. But we don\u2019t have many teams we don\u2019t have what the Premiership have. We\u2019re not playing 50-odd games a season.\u201d While frustrated at the ongoing problems, the 28-year-old is well aware that the switch from a summer to a winter season has improved things. \u201cWe rolled from a summer, into an international tournament into a summer league into international qualifiers. And as you actually map it out, there\u2019ll be players if they\u2019ve not been injured, that will go 18 months cycles or 24 months cycles where they\u2019ve never had more than probably seven days off. And then you look at injuries and maybe somewhere along the line they\u2019re over-use injuries and just inevitable.\u201d With talks of a possible Fifa World League gaining pace, the calendar for those at the top is only going to get tougher. \u201cThe thing is, as players we want more games, but we also want it to fit better. We don\u2019t want there to be an increase of risk to health. \u201cAround 30 games per season is still not a lot compared to what the men do. But then if we\u2019re cramming in 15 games in two months, it\u2019s different, isn\u2019t it? \u201cWe\u2019re talking about something completely different than what would be a eight or nine-month season that you play week in week with a couple of two-game weeks. It\u2019s when you end up doing two games, two games, two games that there is a problem.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
