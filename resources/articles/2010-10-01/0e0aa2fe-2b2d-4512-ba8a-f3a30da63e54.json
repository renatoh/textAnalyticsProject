The club have been exposed to ridicule, prostituted and fractured for three years and have had to rely on Mr Justice Floyd to deliver their one impressive performance of the season so far. It is time to get on with the game. John W Henry, Tom Werner and company had promised to attend the 214th Merseyside derby before yesterday's order blocking the sale. Regardless of the performance of Roy Hodgson's team against Everton, should they eventually become Anfield's new owners they would be unlikely to lose sight of the formidable task ahead. NESV has already granted a beleaguered manager time to prove himself and Hodgson must be relieved at how the off-field drama of the past two weeks has shifted the scrutiny from himself. It has not vanished entirely, however, and whatever the intentions in the boardroom the fact remains that Hodgson must produce some emphatic verdicts of his own to convince the club's support. The argument that this is a derby the Liverpool manager can ill-afford to lose remains as valid today as it did in the aftermath of being outplayed at home by Blackpool. \"Above Us Only Sky\" is the neat tag line at the city's John Lennon Airport, prompting one wag to note \"Below Us Only Wolves and West Ham\". The cries for Kenny Dalglish at Anfield on 3 October were a lament for Liverpool's accelerated decline this season but also an outpouring of the frustration that had developed over how the club was run. The latter, at least, has been released. Tom Hicks and George Gillett being run out of town and losing a minimum of \u00a3101m along the way is a prospect that will uplift everyone connected with Liverpool. Teams that hide behind the excuse of off-field distractions do not generally command sympathy but some is due here. Such has been the constant negativity around Liverpool since the relationship between Hicks and Gillett fractured in late 2007 over plans for a new stadium that the impact has been unavoidable. As Steven Gerrard said yesterday: \"It seems things are nearly sorted off the pitch, so we need to start getting them right on it by getting three points at Goodison on Sunday. I know how frustrated the fans have been with what has been going on and I can understand their feelings. But we've all suffered in this, especially the supporters, and now it's time for us all to pull together and help move the club forward.\" An important distinction should not be lost on Liverpool's prospective new owners. Anfield is euphoric because of a Munchkin moment. The witches are dead and NESV has the red shoes to compliment its Red Sox, subject to appeal. The elation has not arisen from an impending union with more American businessmen. Their origins do not matter. The fact they are not leveraged and are paying \u00a3240m in cash does. But along with Hicks and Gillett, Peter Lim and Mill Financial, NESV are capitalists interested in the profit potential of Liverpool and recent history has taught Anfield's support to treat them with caution. Liverpool will afford Henry and his 16 fellow investors in NESV a warm reception but trust must be earned. The promises that plagued Hicks and Gillett, once exposed as empty, have been conspicuous by their absence from NESV, a lesson has clearly been learnt and there is widespread acceptance that the rebuilding of Liverpool \u2013 squad as well as stadium \u2013 is an arduous process. Merely addressing those problems would represent a radical departure from the previous American regime. Hodgson needs money to spend in January, a notoriously difficult time to buy, as despite having Gerrard and Joe Cole at his disposal the midfield options are woefully inadequate. The manager is not blameless on this score, having spent \u00a35m on Christian Poulsen and \u00a310.7m on a talent he has admitted he cannot accommodate in his best position, Raul Meireles. Pace in a defence that sits so deep it could empathise with the Chilean miners is another pressing requirement. Leading players have grown disillusioned during Liverpool's metamorphosis into a business and legal dispute and do not have the years required before the club can reap the rewards of a new 60,000-plus capacity stadium. They need to be sold on NESV's vision immediately. The group has already discussed financing options for a stadium with the Royal Bank of Scotland and has made known its intentions to meet Joe Anderson, the leader of Liverpool city council, as it considers a redevelopment of Anfield. Both are encouraging signs towards remedying a 40-year-old problem, although the council is firmly in favour of a new arena that will trigger the regeneration of a depressed area. Re-engaging supporters who have been treated with contempt in recent years should also be a priority and the chief executive, Christian Purslow, has said it will be. It has been a historic, overdue day but now the hard work begins where it matters most."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
