We\u2019ve created our own problems and put ourselves back in the mire.\u201d Jack Rodwell could only agree. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive setback,\u201d said the midfielder, whose quietly impressive performance as a substitute proved one of the few pluses for Allardyce\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s such a massive disappointment \u2013 we can\u2019t afford to slip back any further.\u201d Currently second bottom, Sunderland now contemplate an exacting festive schedule featuring trips to Chelsea and Manchester City followed by visits from Liverpool and Aston Villa. No wonder their manager lamented his team \u201cneed to be more like Watford\u201d. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s side play Liverpool, Chelsea, Spurs and Manchester City in their next four games but unlike the Wearsiders, they can face such challenges without fear. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 25 points so, hopefully, we can take those sides on and have great fun,\u201d said Troy Deeney, Watford\u2019s captain and a key influence in this win. From the fourth minute, when the excellent Odion Ighalo beat Sebasti\u00e1n Coates to a cross and scored (although Allardyce was not alone in believing Coates applied the final touch), Deeney and company had real reason for optimism. Damningly, in the past four years Sunderland have not won a league game at the Stadium of Light after falling 1-0 behind. Bolstered by a conviction that Allardyce is the man to change that narrative, almost 44,000 - a wonderful crowd on a snowy afternoon two weeks before Christmas - turned out in the hope of receiving confirmation a corner had been turned. Instead, they saw their back five \u2013 sorely missing the unwell Youn\u00e8s Kaboul \u2013 fail to subdue the threat posed by Ighalo and Deeney on an afternoon when the former should have registered a hat-trick. To his credit, Allardyce acted quickly, jettisoning that five-man defence after 20 minutes. The staggered introductions of Rodwell, Adam Johnson and Jermain Defoe allied to the day\u2019s third system change \u2013 a diamond \u2013 provoked an improvement which left Sunderland arguably unlucky not to secure a point. A late attacking onslaught saw Heurelho Gomes save brilliantly from Defoe and left Deeney limping after helping his defence out with a fabulous last-ditch tackle. \u201cSam\u2019s clever, introducing change throughout the match,\u201d said Flores. \u201cBut we\u2019ve set high standards. The challenge is to keep playing like this.\u201d Allardyce\u2019s critics could argue he should have named Rodwell in the defensive quintet, introduced Defoe earlier and dropped the ineffective Ola Toivonen but Sunderland started so badly it was hard to envisage any configuration working. \u201cNo one was at 100%,\u201d added the home manager. \u201cThere\u2019s an air of panic about the team. We only win when we\u2019ve got a clean sheet. It was a reality check. We\u2019re getting better but this still isn\u2019t quite good enough.\u201d Man of the match Odion Ighalo (Watford)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
