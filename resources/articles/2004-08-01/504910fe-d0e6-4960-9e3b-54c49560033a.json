Already without Carl Cort, Vio Ganea and George Ndah, he may have to plan without Dean Sturridge, who is struggling to be fit for the game. Sturridge partnered Kenny Miller, who is on the transfer list, in Sunday's 2-1 defeat away to Stoke City but failed to re-emerge after half-time. \"Studge was feeling his hamstring from about 10 minutes into the game,\" Jones said. \"But we always knew there was a problem and we always knew there was a danger of him breaking down and unfortunately he did.\" With Cort also nursing a hamstring injury and Ndah a thigh problem, Jones's trouble increased when it was revealed that Ganea requires surgery for a cruciate ligament injury and will be out for six months. The Romania international, who had pledged to stay with Wolves despite last season's relegation and interest from several Premiership clubs, was injured when the knee was twisted in a tackle during the 2-1 defeat by Lyn on the pre-season visit to Norway. Although Cort should return soon, Wolves could go into the match with only Miller and the young striker Leon Clarke fit to lead the attack. Clarke, a 19-year-old born in Birmingham, has yet to start a match for Wolves. He played four times last season on loan at Kidderminster Harriers but was given his chance as Sturridge's replacement on Sunday. Paul Ince will return to lead the side after serving his suspension for being sent off against Tottenham Hotspur in the final game of last season. Jones welcomed the return of the former England midfielder after his side's poor opening performance, and said: \"You need players that are going to pass to a gold shirt.\" The central defender Joleon Lescott could also be in contention for a starting place after playing in the reserve team against West Bromwich Albion on Monday. Preston will be without Ricardo Fuller, who is travelling to the United States to see Dr Richard Steadman, a knee injury specialist. The former Hearts player agreed to join Portsmouth last month but the deal collapsed after he failed a medical. Steadman operated on Fuller last season and the pair will meet to clear up the mystery surrounding the injury. He should return for the weekend fixture at Gillingham. Andy Reid is set to start for Nottingham Forest against Ipswich Town at the City Ground despite the suggestion from his manager Joe Kinnear that the midfielder would be sold if the club were to receive a bid of \u00a35m. The Republic of Ireland international has been a target for Tottenham but featured in Forest's opening-day draw against Wigan at the JJB Stadium. Jim Magilton and Jason de Vos are struggling to be fit for Ipswich after picking up injuries in the win against Gillingham. Magilton has a thigh injury and De Vos has knee trouble, which means that their loan signing Tony Dinning could make his first appearance since arriving from Wigan via further loan spells at Walsall and Blackpool last season . The Derby County defenders Mo Konjic and Jamie Vincent have been back in training but neither will be ready for the game with Leicester City at Pride Park. Derby's manager George Burley is set to send out the same team that lost to Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday, with the summer arrivals Tommy Smith, Inigo Idiakez and Morten Bisgaard set to play again. Leicester will be without Dion Dublin, who is suspended after being sent off during the 0-0 draw against West Ham United at the Walkers Stadium on Saturday. The former Aston Villa player will miss three games after his dismissal for violent conduct and Nathan Blake is set to partner David Connolly in attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
