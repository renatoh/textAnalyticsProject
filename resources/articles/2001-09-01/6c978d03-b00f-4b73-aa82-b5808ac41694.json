The supporters of each candidate see salvation in the success of their man and disaster in that of his rival. But does the personality of the winner really matter all that much? In 1945 the most charismatic politician in Britain, Winston Churchill, widely acclaimed as saviour of his country, was easily defeated by Clement Attlee, a quiet and modest character who as his rival acidly observed had 'much to be modest about'. The most successful Tory leader in electoral terms during the inter-war years was Stanley Baldwin, about as uncharismatic a figure as one could find. There are deeper forces at work in elections than the personalities of leaders, even if the vanity of politicians makes them think otherwise. Does anyone seriously suppose that a different Tory leader could have won the last general election? It is hard to believe that the choice of leader on 12 September is going to be crucial in determining the result of the election of 2005. It will turn much more on the record of the Blair Government than on whether the party faithful choose Kenneth Clarke or Iain Duncan Smith. The Conservatives have a far more serious problem than that. Are they going to survive at all as a major party, or will they go the way, as some predict, of the Liberals after the fall of Lloyd George in 1922? Will they become a third party operating on the fringes of the main struggle? There is nothing in the inherent nature of British politics to prevent this happening. It is not inevitable that the pendulum will forever swing, even if more slowly than it did, simply between Labour and Conservatives. Parties can disappear, like the Radicals, Peelites and the Whigs, and new ones can arise like Labour in the 1920s. But it would be unwise yet to predict the Conservative demise. The party has displayed a remarkable power to recover after seemingly catastrophic defeats, even though the process has often taken a long time. After the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 they lost five successive general elections, but returned in 1874 to become the predominant party for the next 30 years. After the Liberal 'landslide' of 1906 it took them 16 years and four elections to recover power in 1922 and then to become 'the ruling party' until 1945. History suggests that it would be premature to write them off, especially in the light of modern electoral volatility. It was only a year ago that the petrol tankers strike caused the opinion polls briefly to put William Hague ahead of Tony Blair. If past history suggests that the Conservatives can recover, it certainly does not suggest that they will. That depends very much on 'events', the unpredictable joker in the pack which Harold Macmillan dreaded. When the last Liberal government came to an end in 1922 - a prelude to the party's progressive decline for 60 years - it was not clear that they were bound to end as 'the third party'. What was fatal, apart from other problems, was their bitter internal antagonisms. The feud between the followers of Asquith and Lloyd George was never healed. The Liberal Party increasingly became an introspective debating society in which the general public became less and less interested. It also lost whatever social basis it once had. It became irrelevant. If there is a lesson from the past which the Conservatives ought to keep at the front of their minds, it is the supreme importance of party unity. A united party may not always win, but a divided party invariably loses. If the personal and political animosities provoked by 'Europe' continue to fester in the Conservative body politic the party will never win office, however deplorable the future record of Blair may be. The contest between free trader and tariff reformer was an incubus upon the party for 20 years. It only ended when Baldwin sensed its irrelevance and made party unity his prime objective. Whoever wins the current contest will almost certainly try to do the same. The question is which of them has the better chance of playing down 'Europe' and concentrating the party's attention on the weaknesses of Blairism. Already notable opportunities have been missed. Blair's handling of the foot and mouth crisis has been incompetent to a degree which surpasses even his dismal record for ineptitude. On the increasing problem of asylum seekers, the Government shows no sign of having an answer, nor on that of teacher shortages nor NHS waiting lists. Yet the opposition, besotted with its own internal wrangles, has done nothing to expose these defects through the attacks which they deserve. It is sadly like the Liberal record in the 1920s which allowed Labour to become by default the principal opposition party. If the Conservatives do not get their act together now, they could easily be pushed into third place. I do not believe this will happen. There is a solid core in the country which will vote Conservative come what may, partly from tradition and habit, partly from sheer dislike, even hatred, of Tony Blair and his cronies and partly from loathing of the red tape, the endless form filling and questionnaires beloved of Gordon Brown and his acolytes. An intelligent Conservative should take as his bible Lord Saatchi's book The Science of Politics. Though pretentiously entitled, it is a brilliant expos\u00e9 of the lunatic bureaucracy of the social services. The sacking of Frank Field shows that Blair will never reform these. He is far too much in hock to the unions. The Conservatives could easily pack a powerful punch against the encrusted abuses of the public sector. Blair seems to have some plans to do this with the NHS and education. Conservatives should not oppose it - merely say it does not go far enough and press for more private partnership and more selectivity. The Conservatives could moreover outflank their Liberal Democrat rivals, or at least steal their clothes, by 'thinking the unthinkable' and supporting reform of an electoral system which is deeply biased against the Conservatives. And they certainly ought to back the idea of a democratic second chamber. If this is theft, why not? As Blair has shown, theft can pay in politics. The Conservative Party has plenty of ammunition against Blair, who is likely to run into major difficulties over the next four years. But they must submit to a unified command and, as Alastair Campbell would put it, 'be on message'. If they cannot escape from self-indulgent squabbling about personalities and tactics they will indeed decline into a fringe party, and thoroughly deserve their fate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
