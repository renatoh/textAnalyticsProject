Their Ray Davies-style vision of a green and pleasant \u201csweet Arcadia\u201d, finding poetry in Seasalter and Peacehaven, is arguably close to Ukip territory; they\u2019re not helped by the harpsichords and girl-group pastiches which, while knowing, are also twee. In the past their sampling has been atmospheric, but the snatches of Ken Bruce and Sports Report here are self-parodic. However, the shade thrown at a Toby Carvery on Whyteleafe shows them to still be aesthetes after all, and there are strong songs here: Something New wafts like a sunlit net curtain, and you can almost smell the Tupperware and crudites amid the disco party of Dive. Throughout it all, Sarah Cracknell\u2019s voice \u2013 coolly observational with a hint of gossip \u2013 remains a uniquely beautiful sound in British pop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
