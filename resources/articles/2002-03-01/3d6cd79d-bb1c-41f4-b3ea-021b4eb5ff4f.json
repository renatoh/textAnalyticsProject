An emergency meeting of Rugby World Cup Ltd will be held in Cardiff next week when the Australian Rugby Union will present its case for staging the 48-match tournament exclusively, but no final decision will be made until the council meeting in Dublin on April 12. The Australian union, backed by RWC, last week withdrew its invitation to the New Zealand RFU to stage 23 matches following the Kiwis' failure to agree to provide stadiums free of advertising and hospitality facilities because of existing contracts. The New Zealand union is trying to mobilise international board support as it seeks to be reinstated with backing from its own government. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
