Meteorologists predicted the existence of the jet stream in 1937, but it wasn't proved to exist until 1945. The Japanese were the first to try to make use of this upper atmosphere \"motorway\". In November 1944 they began to launch unmanned bomb-laden balloons, intended to ride on the theorised jet stream winds, over the Pacific Ocean to North America. The Japanese learned after the war that some of these balloons made it to the US and Canada. Just as the second world war was coming to a close the Americans began to use a high-altitude bomber \u2013 the Boeing B-29, which could fly at altitudes well above 7km. Meteorologists were asked to prepare a forecast and estimate the flying time from a Pacific Island base. They predicted the existence of a high-altitude 168-knot wind blowing from the west. The commanding officer was sceptical that such a fast wind could exist, but when the pilots returned they reported wind speeds of 170 knots from the west. Finally the jet stream's existence had been confirmed. Today commercial airliners deviate quite a long way in order to hitch a ride on the jet stream, making long-haul easterly journeys (such as between the US and UK) considerably faster than their westerly counterpart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
