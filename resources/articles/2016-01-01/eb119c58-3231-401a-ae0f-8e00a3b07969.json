Harris\u2019s office declined to comment on the report, writing in an email: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on any ongoing or potential investigation,\u201d according to press secretary Rachele Huennekens. Previously published reports suggest ExxonMobil may have spent millions over 27 years to publicly promote opposition to climate change science while privately basing strategies and business models around it. The Guardian reported in July on a company email from Exxon\u2019s in-house climate expert that provided evidence that the company was aware, over a generation ago, of the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, and the potential for carbon-cutting regulations that could hurt its bottom line. It may have factored that knowledge into its decision about a large gas field in southeast Asia. The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time. New York\u2019s attorney general is also conducting a similar probe into ExxonMobil based on previously published reports by the Los Angeles Times and the Columbia University Energy and Environmental Reporting Fellowship. But, Steyer said, California, as the \u201clargest and most populous state\u201d offers a \u201cparticularly strong platform\u201d to increase the reach of any investigation. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer but I believe the laws in California are different and give our attorney general a lot of leeway in terms of how she approaches it,\u201d he said. RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic party\u2019s environmental caucus, added that the Los Angeles and Ventura Democratic party recently passed a resolution she wrote calling on Harris to investigate ExxonMobil. Harris is currently running for US Senate and will seek the party\u2019s endorsement during its February convention. \u201cI wanted to bring it up with Democrats because if she wants the Democrats\u2019 endorsements, she needs to listen to Democrats,\u201d said Miller of her outreach to Harris. Like other climate change activists, Steyer also linked ExxonMobil\u2019s alleged cover-up to similar scandals in the tobacco industry, which for many years fought to deny the negative health effects of smoking. With climate change, \u201cthere is obviously a gigantic impact on the entire world and all the people of the world\u201d, said Steyer. \u201cIt\u2019s a society being misled.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
