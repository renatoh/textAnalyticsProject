Theresa May, in one of her last acts as prime minister, has enshrined in law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, making Britain the first large economy to do so. But two-thirds of people who were questioned by researchers for Greener UK and the Climate Coalition believe Britain needs to cut its carbon emissions to zero far faster. The survey suggests demand for action to tackle the climate crisis is becoming part of a mainstream view. Of the 2,000 people surveyed, 71% said they wanted their MP to support ambitious plans to protect the natural environment and tackle climate change, and a majority wanted to see strong new environmental laws. The Climate Coalition and Greener UK consists of more than 130 organisations including the Women\u2019s Institute (WI), NGOs such as Cafod, Oxfam, WWF and Tearfund, as well as the National Trust, Mumsnet and the National Union of Students. They are lobbying parliament next week to say \u201cThe time is now\u201d for action. Organisers say more than 14,000 people from all over the country intend to come to Westminster to demand urgent action in a rally on Wednesday 26 June. Rosie Harden-Vane, 66, a member of Seaton Valley WI, said: \u201cI have never done anything like this before and feel quite nervous. However, if I can\u2019t make my voice heard, I would be turning my back on the most important issue of our time. If we don\u2019t change the way we are treating the planet with immediate effect, in my lifetime the decline will be irreversible.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s intervention to sign the 2050 net zero target into UK law in an amendment to the Climate Change Act 2008 makes the UK the first member of the G7 group of industrialised nations to legislate for that target. Clara Goldsmith, campaigns director at the Climate Coalition, said the decision was clearly a response to calls for action from voters, which have grown louder and louder in recent months. \u201cNow we need our politicians to put policies in place to deliver on that target, as well as measures to clean up the air we breathe and the plastic in our seas. The findings in this poll make clear the scale of support for action.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
