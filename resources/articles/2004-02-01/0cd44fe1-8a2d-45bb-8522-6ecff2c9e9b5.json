Quite why you'd be asking the Fiver to compile a list of Dream Teams of Our Time is unclear, though regulars might sense it's simply another shamelessly contrived introduction into a piece involving a Dream Team management tale with not a single proper quote to back it up. Bah! Word on the street is that Spurs want Mark Hughes to work alongside Giovanni Trapattoni next season, while letting him keeping the Wales job. According to the phlegmy warble of the 'E Stanah man outside our window, \"the club are in talks with the Wales coach to become the Italian's assistant in the summah, do-what, wallop, gertcha!\" Which is certainly news to the Fiver. We believed tousle-haired Teddy Boy David Pleat when he claimed only last weekend that the deal was already \"done and dusted\", so wagered Granny Fiver's gin savings on Raddy Antic. Double bah!! \"Hughes will be groomed to take over from Trapattoni when the Welshman's contract with his country runs out after the (World Cup) finals in Germany in 2006,\" warbled the Stanah, word for word from a dossier marked 'Top Secret Stuff'. Then, having checked over both shoulders and across to Farringdon's famed grassy knoll, he added, with a knowing wink, that: \"If the Trapattoni deal falls through, Spurs will attempt to persuade Hughes to join in the summer as their No1, rendering this poxy Dream Team theme an utter waste of tim... \" Triple Bah!!! * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Playing with the players here is only going to prepare me for the next stage, which is European and international football\" - Scott Parker's Joe Cole impersonation is uncanny. * * * * * * * * * * * * NO JOE-K When Nottingham Forest terminated Paul Hart's contract on Saturday, the Fiver's 'smart' money was on Glenn Hoddle or even Psycho Pearce taking over. Instead - and this won't surprise the more astute among you one jot - the club has opted for a third option: Joe Kinnear. \"We're in discussions at the moment with Joe and I would hope we could move our negotiations forward in the coming 48 hours,\" announced a breathless Forest chairman Nigel Doughty, to widespread groans from Forest fans (probably) and the Fiver (certainly). So why could the switch from Hart to heart-attack victim prove so painful? Well, under Hart, Forest's injury-hit side were certainly struggling - 14 matches without a win puts even Keegan's lot to shame - but at least they had a side with more culture than a fancy yoghurt. What they will get in Kinnear is Mr Wimbledon, Mr Route One, Mr Strengthen-your-neck-with-one-90-minute-workout-a-week. Not that Doughty agrees, of course. \"He's an inspirational and charismatic figure and his popularity with supporters at his previous club speaks volumes for the job he's done,\" he drooled. The Fiver knows people who have worked with Kinnear who certainly don't share that enthusiasm. Still, as the Forest chairman points out, you can't fault his achievements. \"He had tremendous success at Luton, who he took to promotion in his first full season before they were gripped by financial and ownership problems,\" he cooed. \"And during his time at Wimbledon he was a key figure in developing a lot of talented young players, and everyone knows how much emphasis we put on the academy\". Mmmm. It sounds like the beginning of a beautiful relationship - let's hope it's doesn't lead to the Second Division, eh? * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Ged Houllier's boggling eyes are approaching warp speed, suggesting a daring triple bid for Owen Hargreaves, Marc Overmars and Newcastle's Stephen Taylor is on the cards.
