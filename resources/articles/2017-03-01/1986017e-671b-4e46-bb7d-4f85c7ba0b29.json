Ava DuVernay is a filmmaker of genuine political and emotional intelligence, and after 2014\u2019s Selma she turned her eyes to the USA\u2019s contemporary race disaster: the prison system. The result goes far beyond most film or television talking-heads docos, in the sensitivity of both its aesthetics and its message: that the privatised prison system criminalises blackness, not behaviour. Film: Girlfriend\u2019s Day (US, 2017) directed by Michael Stephenson \u2013 out now Once greeting-card writer of the year, Ray Wentworth (Better Call Saul\u2019s Bob Odenkirk) has lost his touch since his divorce. His professional luck is lifted by a government effort to stimulate the failing, hopelessly analogue greeting-card industry: a new national holiday, called Girlfriend\u2019s Day. Ray\u2019s the kind of guy who believes novelists are just writers like him but with a brevity problem. His proud quest to regain his revered stature among his peers leads him into crime and lies, when what he really needs to do is be able to feel again. This Netflix Original, which Odenkirk co-wrote, is too dour and protracted in its comedic beats to be called offbeat. Really, Girlfriend\u2019s Day is a sad-boy comedy, a strange creation of bitter middle-aged awkwardness and denial \u2013 but Odenkirk and his long funny miserable face carry it through. TV: Love (US, 2017), created by Judd Apatow \u2013 out now Beyond the stoner-fratboy fare for which he is perhaps most well-known, the emotional range of Judd Apatow\u2019s films (This is 40, Funny People) rarely covers more than a slender spectrum of resignation, bitterness and disappointment. What a lovely thing to find that his Netflix program, Love, offers something a little sweeter and sadder. Perhaps television, in its bite-sized, meandering way, is Apatow\u2019s saving grace: he\u2019s hit a perfect balance of bittersweet laughs. Where Love\u2019s first season saw Mickey, a tough, lovable addict, and Gus, an innocent mid-west nerd, circle each other romantically, the second season explores what a relationship between them might look like. Whether they\u2019re perfectly paired or deadly mismatched, the untangling of their relationship is one of the most satisfying, true-to-life things onscreen right now. Honourable mentions: American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson (TV, 6 March), Grace and Frankie (TV, season three, 14 March); Selma (film, 18 March). Stan Film: The Man Who Fell To Earth (UK, 1976) by Nicolas Roeg \u2013 18 March What a rich, strange, cult classic. The film\u2019s shining quality is, of course, David Bowie\u2019s performance as an alien on earth looking for water for his home planet. Lithe and graceful, Bowie goes beyond most extra-terrestrial film cliches. Swaying towards the slow-burn, arthouse end of the genre rather than action-packed thriller, The Man Who Fell to Earth shows us that one of the key objectives of good alien film is to defamiliarise us to the absurdities of life as we know it. Director Nicolas Roeg uses Bowie\u2019s character to satirise the materialism and unchecked industrial insanity of capitalism: seeing our man/alien Bowie begin a tech start-up (really \u2013 the film was seriously prescient) and subsequently fall into a narcotised life of alcoholism and riches is really something. Honourable mentions: Adventure Time, seasons 4 \u2013 7 (TV, out now); Summertime (film, out now); The 400 Blows (film, 28 March), Jules and Jim (film, 28 March). Dendy Direct Film: The Rehearsal (NZ/Australia, 2016) by Alison McClean \u2013 out now This New Zealand-shot, Australian coproduced film didn\u2019t get a theatrical release, but plays beautifully on your big screen at home. A film about theatre, based on the novel by Eleanor Catton, The Rehearsal reintroduces James Rolleston, the beautiful young actor from Taika Waititi\u2019s Boy (2010). Rolleston plays Stanley: a fresh-faced first-year acting school student who falls for younger student Isolde, whose elder sister was involved in a scandalous affair with her much-older tennis tutor. Stanley can\u2019t help but plumb his new love\u2019s family\u2019s secrets to fuel his major drama project, as film begins to play with the idea that people don\u2019t know their boundaries until they step over them. Australian director Alison McClean is one of the lesser-known voices of Antipodean cinema, having made several very personal films throughout the decades. The Rehearsal is sensitively attuned to the psychologies of its characters: an honest, finely crafted film of minutely shifting character loyalties. Honourable mentions: Hacksaw Ridge (film, 15 March); I, Daniel Blake (film, 22 March). Foxtel Play TV: Big Little Lies (US, 2017) directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e \u2013 out Mondays Conjured in Pinterest pastels, a hallucinatory quality haunts HBO\u2019s new murder-mystery drama, written by David E Kelley (Boston Legal) and directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (Dallas Buyers Club) based on the book by Australian author Liane Moriarty. The title credits are all Lonely Planet California beach slo-mo until a hand holding a gun floats into view. Shots of waves roll in reverse motion, scenes slide seamlessly in and out of each other and the camera hovers restlessly around the characters. Amid all this, flashes of satire come up fast and funny. The set-up is akin to The Slap \u2013 a rift between parents cuts apart an upper-middle-class community of alpha mothers and gives rise to a murder, the victim and culprit of which is unknown to us. Reese Witherspoon plays the peroxide-blonde lead (the kind of dominant friend who orders for you at a cafe), Laura Dern her competitor and Nicole Kidman her ally, with Shailene Woodley as the new-to-town, lower-class single parent outsider. These are uber-Moms and this is their universe. They\u2019re all immersed in varying depths of self-rationalisation and denial. And their small children, who are their parents\u2019 projects, have no idea of their own affluence. A disturbingly clear-sighted satire of aspiration, competitive parenting and social perfectionism. Honourable mentions: Divorce (TV, out now); Six Feet Under (TV, out now). SBS On Demand TV: Atlanta (US, 2016) by Donald Glover \u2013 out Tuesdays throughout March Television comedy continues to evolve in unexpected ways. Like Seinfeld, Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta has none of the end-of-scene punchlines like the sitcoms we grew up with. Like Curb Your Enthusiasm, it leaves us stranded in missed moments and petered-out conversations. Like Arrested Development, it centres on a perplexed guy trying to keep the chaos at bay (Glover\u2019s Earn is broke, shut out by his parents, on the perpetual brink of break-up with his partner and trying to support his daughter by acting as manager to his rapper cousin, who is in fact a drug dealer). Like Search Party, it beautifully communicates the malaise of today. And like Transparent, it has its characters confront pain often to reel back into delusion. Atlanta offers perspective on everything: the music industry, the justice system, the family, the intersection between wealth and race, the feeling of being down and out. Glover has made a comedy, but a challenging one \u2013 its sly jokes are sometimes laugh-out-loud and always wryly observed from a world that is as difficult as ever to understand. It\u2019s even better than you\u2019ve heard. Film: Mustang (Turkey/France, 2015) by Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven \u2013 out now Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven\u2019s debut film took festival audiences by surprise, and not just because some reviewers called it a Turkish Virgin Suicides, but because it exposed what the director sees as the medieval conditions experienced by many women in Turkey. After an innocent interaction with some schoolboys on a beach, five orphaned girls are beaten, in order of age, by their grandmother, before being pulled from school and imprisoned in their isolated country house. \u201cThe house became a wife factory, which we never came out of,\u201d says the narrator, Lale, who watches with increasing despair and powerlessness as her four elder siblings get married off one by one. Though it sounds harrowing, Erg\u00fcven plays with the film\u2019s mood: the first part unfolds like a dream, and as the girls\u2019 innocence is degraded and their sense of horror unfolds, the tone becomes increasingly suspenseful. Beyond the guarding of chastity and the stripping of girls\u2019 and women\u2019s rights, the film is a vivid portrait of sibling relationships and children\u2019s secret lives \u2013 their inner worlds beyond the reach of reproachful adults. Film: The Handmaiden (South Korea, 2016) by Park Chan-Wook \u2013 out now Korean arthouse auteur Park Chan-Wook knows about revenge \u2013 the long, determined game played by his protagonist in Old Boy and the underclass heroes of Snowpiercer. But in The Handmaiden, an erotic psychological thriller about an heiress who falls in love with her maid in Japanese-occupied Korea, he shows what he knows about the female psyche. This is a wild film of blood and secrets, of women who love women, who must kill men to liberate themselves, and who long for respite and a sense of belonging in a brutal world. It\u2019s a story of sex as spirituality and class as oppression; it\u2019s funny, freaky, and one of the most grand, original things I\u2019ve seen at the cinema. When We Rise (US, 2016) by Dustin Lance Black \u2013 out now In today\u2019s golden age of television, who knew an old-school miniseries could be so satisfying? When We Rise\u2019s dramatisation of the gay liberation movement\u2019s rise in 1973 in San Francisco has a fist-pumping, rah-rah tone to it, helped out by some mastermind casting (Whoopi freaking Goldberg! Rosie O\u2019Donnell!). The generosity of the performances of the Australians in the cast, Guy Pearce and Rachel Griffiths, are as stellar as you\u2019d expect, belying their A-list status. The show is most illuminating when its writers go for the thorny stuff as well as the movement\u2019s contradictions: archival footage of a doctor orating on the impossibility of gay people\u2019s happiness; a young queer man\u2019s father (a psychiatrist) telling him a lobotomy isn\u2019t out of the question to cure his illness; Goldberg\u2019s character recalling the creation of a Lesbian Mothers\u2019 Unit \u201cto keep the state from snatching our kids\u201d; gender divides between the lesbian and gay wings of the movement. In these adventurous moments, this often feel-good series hits its dramatic peaks. Created by Milk writer Dustin Lance Black, with director Gus Van Sant. Honourable mentions: Sample People (film, out now). ABC iView TV: Art Bites, Home: The Art of Ian Strange (Australia, 2017) \u2013 out now Australian artist Ian Strange started his interrogation of home by drawing black holes and crosses over old photos of suburban houses. Then he started to draw and paint directly on actual houses. Then he started destroying the symbols of his West Australian suburban upbringing \u2013 exploding Holden commodores, painting a giant skull on a replica of his childhood house \u2013 making the most familiar thing of all, the home, aberrant. This fascinating series of six tea-break-sized episodes takes us from Strange\u2019s Australian beginnings to the houses of Ohio, his current canvasses. His internationally renowned work, according to David Hurlston, the senior curator of Australian art at the National Gallery of Victoria, says something important \u201cabout dislocation or disenfranchisement from community and society.\u201d A slick, watchable series that breaks down the ideas of contemporary art for a broad audience. TenPlay TV: Neighbours (Australia, 1985-forever) \u2013 every weekday, with episodes expiring after a fortnight If you stepped off Ramsay Street ages ago, now\u2019s the time to come back. They may have lost Australia\u2019s finest soapie actress, Ashleigh Brewer, to The Bold and the Beautiful in 2014, but the producers of Neighbours have ramped up all the classic soapie tropes: people coming back from the dead, blackmail by minors, spying from bushes, secret babies, sexually deviant priests \u2013 you name it. Is recently reincarnated Dee an evil gold-digger or does a fresh plot twist await us? Does her reappearance make Toadie a bigamist? Who is their grown-up daughter? Things are sudsier than ever in Erinsborough, with manipulations and conspiracies going beyond even the glory days of evil Izzy (Natalie Bassingthwaighte). If, like me, you believe the soapie is a glorious, overlooked artform, you\u2019ll appreciate Neighbours\u2019 new levels of creativity. If they push even further towards the low-budget kitsch of US soap Bold and the Beautiful\u2019s classic \u201cTaylor\u2019s alive!\u201d moment, we\u2019re in for fun times on traditional broadcast television."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
