It shows the character and belief that this team has,\u201d said Montemurro. With the bit between their teeth it looked like Liverpool would take a valuable point off the champions but Miedema, who is struggling with a back injury, headed home her 16th league goal of the season to deny them a chance to move clear of bottom-placed Bristol City. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I could even play tonight,\u201d said Miedema when asked whether she had been worried about having gone four league games without a goal. \u201cWe just need to keep going. I\u2019ve got a sore back, hopefully it would solve itself soon, the pitches we play on don\u2019t help sometimes.\u201d Having not played in 18 days as three of their last four home games were postponed due to the state of the Prenton Park pitch, the visit of Arsenal was switched from Tranmere\u2019s home to Chester\u2019s Deva Stadium, which is likely to be their home for the remainder of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because you prep to play Birmingham and then you turn up and it\u2019s off, and then you do the same for Everton and it\u2019s off,\u201d said the Liverpool manager, Vicky Jepson. \u201cBut we are a professional group with a positive culture and everybody digs deep. Chester have been incredible. The groundsmen are already out looking after the pitch for us, we\u2019re not used to that. \u201cThis stadium is perfect for us, people laugh because it\u2019s in Wales, but it\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s got grass on it, what more do you want?\u201d said Jepson with a grin. Liverpool may have had only one win from their 12 outings and been level on points with bottom-placed Bristol before kick-off but look more closely at the league table and the potential that exists in Jepson\u2019s side is clear. They have a superior goal difference to the three clubs above them and their defeats have been narrow. Arsenal are not without problems of their own. With Kim Little having undergone surgery on a foot injury, Lia W\u00e4lti still absent and Jill Roord suspended, Montemurro was forced to push Leah Williamson forward into the midfield and to field a bench with just four outfield players on it \u2013 two 16-year-olds, one 17-year-old and a returning Jen Beattie. \u201cI\u2019m getting hammered everywhere, it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Montemurro of criticism of his decision to stick with a small squad. \u201cWe\u2019ve been stretched for a while. I\u2019m not going to make any excuses. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sign a player saying \u2018you might play when player number six or seven gets injured\u2019 that\u2019s just not the way I do things. We\u2019ve had a lot of unfortunate situations and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d Needing a win to stay in the title race, Arsenal began brightly but were wasteful with their chances and, with close to 15 minutes played, a sublime one-touch Rachel Furness through-ball set Rinsola Babajide free in a race against Louise Quinn. The Ireland international was no match for the forward\u2019s pace and Babajide slipped the ball low past Pauline Peyraud-Magnin in the Arsenal goal. Babajide continued to cause problems but Liverpool seemed to play their way into trouble a little too easily, with a determination to play out from the back struggling under the Gunners\u2019 high press. Two goals in two minutes was the punishment. A Jordan Nobbs ball from the right was deflected away but Miedema beat everyone in the middle to push the ball past Anke Preuss. Then, Nobbs was on hand to head in from close range after a pinpoint cross from Lisa Evans on the left. The impressive Thursday night crowd fell silent but on the stroke of half-time they roared back into life as Furness\u2019s first-time finish, after an Evans clearance was headed to her feet, drew Liverpool level. Arsenal though, have a game-changer in Miedema and a powerful header from the Dutch forward ended the renaissance. \u201cIt was a good performance for us,\u201d reflected Jepson. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two weeks of not playing. It\u2019s broken our momentum.We\u2019ve got to learn from the mistakes but for the full 90 minutes our standards were high and if we keep them like that for the rest of the season we\u2019ll be alright. There\u2019s nine games left in the league, nine games.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
