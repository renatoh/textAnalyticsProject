Mr Bryant, who was also acting editor of the Daily Telegraph for 11 turbulent months, will leave the Telegraph Media Group this weekend, the company said today. Mr Bryant was acting editor of the Daily Telegraph until October, when he was moved aside to make way for Will Lewis, who was appointed editor after championing the multimedia future of the Telegraph papers and masterminding their move to new headquarters in Victoria. When Mr Bryant joined the Telegraph Group as editor-in-chief in November 2005 after chief executive Murdoch MacLennan poached him from the Daily Mail, his role was foreseen as being an editorial elder statesman and avuncular adviser to the group's editors. But his appointment immediately prompted the resignation of Daily Telegraph editor Martin Newland unhappy that Mr Bryant had been appointed as his superior. Mr Bryant was then appointed acting editor of the Daily Telegraph as well as editor-in-chief. He soon became embroiled in a power struggle with then Sunday Telegraph editor Sarah Sands. He played a key role in her axing the following March, and appointment of her replacement, Patience Wheatcroft. During his tenure, the Telegraph endured a wave of redundancies and resignations, including 54 editorial redundancies this year as the group moved to new multimedia premises in Victoria in autumn. Mr Bryant, who was never the driving force behind the changes, himself fell victim to the revolution when Will Lewis was appointed editor in October. Mr Bryant retained the title of editor-in-chief but the role was seen as largely titular. \"We owe John an enormous debt for the skill and dedication that has brought to the role and the group over the last year,\" said Murdoch MacLennan, the chief executive of the Telegraph Media Group. \"Under his leadership, the Daily Telegraph grew in strength and stature as the market-leading quality newspaper. \"And John prepared the ground for our move to Victoria. His role in helping us on the way to becoming the leading digital quality media company has been crucial. We shall miss him.\" Mr Bryant said he had had \"a great time\" among the Telegraph's journalists and writers. \"It has been a joy to return the Telegraph to so many of its great traditional strengths, to give it a renewed sense of direction, and at the same time to have been part of the transformation that is now taking place within the Telegraph Media Group,\" he said. \"I look forward to keeping up many acquaintances, and watching both the newspapers and the website go from strength to strength.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
