Now with the stakes raised as teams start dropping like flies, here is a look at the key takeaways from the US women\u2019s national team victory over Sweden to stay perfect through three matches and top Group F. This wasn\u2019t the reassuring test US fans might\u2019ve hoped for After the US coasted past Thailand and Chile, Sweden was supposed to finally offer the test that would to an end to questions about the USA\u2019s steel. But the team\u2019s win, while convincing, needs to be qualified a bit. With Sweden already guaranteed a spot in the round of 16, Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson was clearly looking past the USA and ahead to the first game of the knockout round. He rotated out seven players who had started in Sweden\u2019s previous match and gave a handful of players their first minutes of the tournament. \u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t have much time between these matches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played tonight, we\u2019ll have the bus trip tomorrow and recuperate, and we play again Monday. That\u2019s the match that is the most important one and that was the priority when I picked my lineup.\u201d The American attack again looked relatively strong, with their two goals a fair haul for the amount of danger they created in the final third. But defensively the Americans just weren\u2019t tested in the way critics may have hoped \u2013 just about all of Sweden\u2019s attempts on goal either missed the frame or went straight to goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. It\u2019s not to say the performance wasn\u2019t promising \u2013 Naeher looked shaky against Chile in the match\u2019s only real threatening moment, but her decision-making was on point against Sweden. Still, it wasn\u2019t enough to wash away fears that the USWNT can avoid conceding goals against a top team. More suspect injury reports show the USA\u2019s confidence First it happened in the opener against Thailand: Becky Sauerbrunn was left out of the starting lineup for a \u201cmild quad issue.\u201d (Note that it wasn\u2019t an injury and US Soccer was clearly choosing not to call it one.) Then against Sweden, Julie Ertz was held out for a mild \u201chip contusion\u201d. As with Sauerbrunn, her absence was termed \u201cprecautionary\u201d. More than a few reporters in the American press corps have a hunch that Sauebrunn and Ertz, two crucial players, were just rested against opponents the Americans were confident about beating. Resting players isn\u2019t anything new, but the Americans seemingly have a luxury few other teams in this tournament have: they can rest players whenever they want \u2013 as was the case during an almost full lineup rotation against Chile \u2013 and still look full strength. \u201cPeople should know we rotate our players, we have a strong 23, and we\u2019re always fresh and ready to go,\u201d said Crystal Dunn when asked what other teams should takeaway from the US performance. The US is too busy winning to worry about plotting One of the biggest talking points coming into Thursday\u2019s match against Sweden was whether Jill Ellis and co might try to game the system and lose so the Americans could avoid France, the other best team in the tournament so far. But anyone who has been following the USWNT\u2019s run through the World Cup so far already knew the answer: not a chance. As if a record-setting 13-0 win over Thailand didn\u2019t show the Americans wanted to play at 100%, coach Jill Ellis\u2019s aggressive lineup against Sweden confirmed it. Rose Lavelle may have put it best after beating Sweden: \u201cI think if you\u2019re scared to play a team in the World Cup, you honestly don\u2019t deserve to win it.\u201d In the lead-up to the final game of the group stage, Ellis talked about the importance of everyone feeling good. Momentum may be an intangible, subjective thing that only exists in the minds of players, but it\u2019s real \u2013 and the Americans have it right now. Not every player who deserves to start will The question was a relatively simple one: If everyone is healthy \u2013 if Julie Ertz doesn\u2019t have a \u201chip contusion\u201d \u2013 how can Samantha Mewis got on the field as a starter? \u201cAt this point, just having the depth that we need, especially in that midfield with legs, I think that\u2019s important,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need legs.\u201d In other words: Mewis, who was arguably one of the USA\u2019s best players on Thursday may not start and that\u2019s just how it is. The Americans have considerable depth and \u2013 opponents beware \u2013 they intend to use it. To wit: it\u2019s been well-documented that Carli Lloyd isn\u2019t pleased she hasn\u2019t been starting regularly for the Americans either. But that doesn\u2019t figure to change. Asked last week about why she\u2019s so open about her displeasure, Lloyd said there\u2019s nothing wrong with the USWNT\u2019s starting-caliber players wanting to be on the field. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIf I was satisfied with that, I really shouldn\u2019t be here. That\u2019s not who I am as a person and player. I know my ability is there. There\u2019s honestly nothing holding me back except for the coach\u2019s decision.\u201d Those decisions for Ellis are difficult ones, and it means players who deserve to start won\u2019t.
