Brought on as a substitute for Neil Harris, he boosted their automatic-promotion hopes by scoring the stoppage-time goal which gave them a 1-0 win. Following Peterborough's earlier success over Leicester, Millwall, who have played one match fewer than Posh, reduced the gap between the two teams back to five points. Millwall's opponents for their match in hand at home on Tuesday, Colchester, suffered a depressing afternoon in losing 3-0 at Scunthorpe. Gary Hooper scored the first two goals to bring his total for the season to 29, three short of the tally with which Billy Sharp helped propel Scunthorpe to the League One title two seasons ago. It is some record for a player who managed only four goals in 41 games for his previous club, Southend, before his move to Scunthorpe last summer. Yeovil's hopes of avoiding relegation were boosted by a surprise 1-0 win over Swindon \u2013 their first victory in eight matches following the appointment of Terry Skiverton as player-manager. The only goal came from 18-year-old Jonathan Obika, who is on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. Wycombe, having slipped out of the League Two top three following last Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Rochdale, dropped another two home points as they allowed Shrewsbury to come from behind to hold them to a 1-1 draw. They could easily have been two or three down before an excellent Gary Holt chip from outside the penalty area put them ahead. Ben Davies's late equaliser was no more than Shrewsbury merited. The point for Wycombe initially put them third in place of Gillingham on goal difference. But with Gillingham drawing 1-1 at Brentford and Bury beating Bournemouth (which enabled Bury to join Brentford and Rochdale in the top three at Gillingham's expense) they now stand fifth. Shrewsbury, in the fourth play-off position, were luckier, in that Bradford City, the team immediately behind them \u2013 and, like Wycombe, another side who have been struggling to cope with the high expectations and hopes surrounding them -could only manage a goalless draw at Chester. Wayne Rooney's 18-year-old brother, John, scored his first senior goal \u2013 from 20 yards \u2013 for Macclesfield in the 2-1 defeat at Dagenham and Redbridge. There was another stirring performance from the bottom team, Luton, who warmed up for their Johnstone's Paint Trophy final against Scunthorpe next Sunday by coming from behind for a 2-1 win at Morecambe \u2013 the Lancashire team's first defeat in 13 matches. Unfortunately for Luton, though, the third-from-bottom team, Grimsby, also collected three points in overcoming Aldershot 1-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
