Pogba, who has been called up by Deschamps for France\u2019s forthcoming friendlies against Colombia and Russia, has missed a number of pivotal games for United in recent weeks after a largely underwhelming season at Old Trafford. The midfielder did not feature when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side beat Liverpool in the Premier League, came on as a late substitute in the Champions League defeat by Sevilla and was absent against Brighton in the FA Cup. Indeed Mourinho has recently turned to the 21-year-old Scott McTominay for midfield cohesion, praising the home-grown player as \u201chumble\u201d and adding the former academy player does not seek \u201cheadlines or flashes\u201d. However McTominay\u2019s promotion has led to Pogba seeing less game-time and, according to the France coach, life is difficult for the 25-year-old who cost \u00a392.3m when he returned to the club in 2016. Deschamps told L\u2019Equipe: \u201cThis is a situation that he must not appreciate because of everything he would have been able to offer. There must be numerous reasons. He cannot be happy with what he is going through with his club.\u201d Pogba returned to United from Juventus 18 months ago and won the Europa League and League Cup last season. However, he has found life tougher in this campaign, making 27 appearances for Mourinho, scoring the last of his three league goals in November against Newcastle. Deschamps added: \u201cIt\u2019s not specific to Paul. It can happen elsewhere that a player is a bit down or is going through a particular situation with his club. \u201cThat could be Paul now, or others at other times, and I will do as I always do and talk to that player to understand better, because I don\u2019t have all the information.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
