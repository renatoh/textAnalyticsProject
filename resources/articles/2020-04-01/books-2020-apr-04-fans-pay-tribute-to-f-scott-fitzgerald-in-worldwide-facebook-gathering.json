To mark the moment, and to celebrate the publication that same month of Fitzgerald\u2019s first novel, This Side of Paradise, fans of the great American writer across the world have joined together for online events, including a mass reading of the text. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a book when it came out \u2013 it was a cultural event,\u201d said Dr Kirk Curnutt, director of the F Scott Fitzgerald Society. \u201cWe have had to get creative [because of Covid-19 restrictions] and so we set up a Facebook reading.\u201d The infamous marriage, solemnised at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, did not run smoothly, but it did kick off in style. After enjoying midnight room service snacks of champagne and \u2013 intriguingly \u2013 fresh spinach, the couple decamped to the neighbouring Commodore Hotel where, legend has it, they spun in the revolving doors for half an hour. Zelda had agreed to marry the 23-year-old Princeton graduate once he was a published author, and her gamble was soon to pay off. \u201cHe had been an advertising copywriter, and socialite Zelda Sayre wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. He had to convince her he was going somewhere,\u201d said Curnutt, an English professor at Troy University in Montgomery, Alabama, Zelda\u2019s home town. A local Montgomery bookshop, Read Herring, will be marking the occasion by giving its first drive-through customers copies of a new collection, published by NewSouth Books, of three short stories by Fitzgerald set in a fictionalised version of the town. By the end of April 1920 the author\u2019s debut novel had made his name. \u201cThis Side of Paradise is a bold, almost cocky novel, and it came from nowhere,\u201d Philip McGowan, editor of a new Oxford World Classics print of the book, published next month, told the Observer. \u201cThe novel is important because it is his first one and not because it is especially well-crafted,\u201d McGowan added. \u201cIt sold better than The Beautiful and Damned, [The Great] Gatsby or Tender is the Night. \u201cSet in an America about to go into prohibition, it blasts a hole through 19th-century morality. It is really about teenagers having sex, and that was a bit of a shocker. All his later novels were measured against it, because it had broken the mould.\u201d A version of Zelda is a key character in This Side of Paradise, and she went on to inspire female characters throughout his fiction. \u201cHe wanted the book to secure Zelda and had promised the earth. This book tipped the scales for her, so they got married a few days later,\u201d said McGowan. Competing views of the marriage suggest that either he was a genius and she was \u201ca pain\u201d, said McGowan, or that he was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and she was undervalued. \u201cBoth are partly true, I think.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2020 to replace the photograph with one correctly showing Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
