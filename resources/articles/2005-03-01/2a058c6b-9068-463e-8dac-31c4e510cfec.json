As a senior Christian Democrat and friend of Pope John Paul II, Mr Buttiglione is unlikely to have agreed without the Vatican's approval. His offer again focuses attention on the Roman Catholic hierarchy's controversially sympathetic attitude towards Mr Aziz, who was baptised into a church of Christians native to Mesopotamia, the Chaldean Uniat church, which is in communion with Rome. Last year Mr Buttiglione was forced to withdraw as Italy's nominee for the European commission over his alleged views on homosexuality. Though he would not go to Baghdad in his capacity as minister, it creates a problem for Silvio Berlusconi, whose government stood four-square behind the Bush administration's policy of regime change in Iraq. Mr Aziz, 69, deputy prime minister and foreign minister until the US-led invasion, figured as the eight of spades in the pack handed out to American soldiers to help them identify fugitive leaders, and was arrested in April 2003. He now faces trial on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He is accused of taking part in bloody purges of the ruling Ba'ath party in the 1970s and 1980s. He argues that his role was exclusively diplomatic, and that he bears no responsibility for internal abuses by the regime. A spokesman for Mr Buttiglione went further, portraying Mr Aziz as having been a restraining influence on the fallen dictator; Mr Buttiglione would \"testify to the moderating role played by Tariq Aziz in respect of Saddam Hussein and the efforts made by him to avoid the two wars in Iraq in 1991 and 2003\". Shortly before the invasion, in February 2003, the Pope received Mr Aziz at the Vatican, a move that horrified Washington. Last December, it was reported that Catholic prelates had helped provide the former Iraqi minister with legal advice and assistance. While in power, Mr Aziz is often credited in the Vatican with playing an important behind-the-scenes role in protecting Iraq's Christian population, whose situation has become far more precarious since the fall of Saddam. Mr Aziz is one of an estimated 600,000 followers of the Chaldean rite, loyal to Rome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
