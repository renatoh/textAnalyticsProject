By 1959, the term \u201cLiberal\u201d was used by some Conservatives, most of whom had no connection with British liberalism, in a variety of ways. A quick glance at my 1951 Times guidebook to the House of Commons reveals National Liberal and Conservative, Conservative and National Liberal, Liberal and Conservative and Conservative and Liberal. These labels were sometimes used to acknowledge previous mergers of National Liberal and Conservative associations but were often used with no justification whatsoever. In an interview with David Dutton for his authoritative history of the National Liberals, Heseltine, who stood as a Conservative and National Liberal, said that the use of \u201cNational Liberal\u201d was just a \u201chistoric relic; it played no part in the campaign\u201d. The historic Liberal party described such Conservative candidates as \u201cliquorice allsorts\u201d. As a former Liberal party member, now a Liberal Democrat, I am delighted to have Heseltine and many other moderate Conservatives appalled at Boris Johnson\u2019s Tory party on my side. In the light of the press conference at which Heseltine endorsed Sam Gyimah (ex-Tory) and Chuka Umunna (ex-Labour) as Lib Dem candidates, perhaps the fluidity of current British politics is making liquorice allsorts of us all.
