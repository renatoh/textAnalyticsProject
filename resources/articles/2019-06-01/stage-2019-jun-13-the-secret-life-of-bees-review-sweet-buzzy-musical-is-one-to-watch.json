Bees, of course. Strings, too. And also the unmistakable sound of a stirring, soul-shivering new musical brought to bloom. The Secret Life of Bees, directed by Sam Gold with music by Duncan Sheik, lyrics by Susan Birkenhead and a book by Lynn Nottage, is an adaptation of Sue Monk Kidd\u2019s 2002 novel, a sweeping and occasionally syrupy tale of a black housekeeper and the white girl she cares for in 1960s South Carolina. Guided by an old postcard with a picture of a black Madonna, Rosaleen (Saycon Sengbloh), bloodied and jailed after attempting to vote, and Lily (Elizabeth Teeter), abused by her father, run away together. They seek and find sanctuary in the apiary run by August Boatwright (LaChanze) and her sisters, May (Anastacia McCleskey) and June (Eisa Davis). Through work and love and worship, Lily is healed of her past and Rosaleen urged toward her future. The show begins in a golden half-light (the work of Mimi Lien\u2019s brick and wood set with its dozens of candles and lighting designer Jane Cox\u2019s amber tones). The musicians are onstage and as the cast enters, Gold imparts the feeling of a ritual, reflected in Sheik\u2019s River of Melting Sun and its shimmering harmonies (Jason Hart provided the vocal arrangements). Efficiently, Nottage\u2019s book introduces the characters, the circumstances, the obstacles. Sheik and Birkenhead\u2019s luxuriant songs heighten the emotions and intensify the conflicts, the music enriched by some African instrumentation (hand drums, a marimba) and a few lyrics that borrow from the Gullah language as in the transcendent Tek A Hol A My Soul. Of course, a novel is more capacious than a musical, especially one that runs a little more than two hours, so certain aspects of the story (which seems to cross-pollinate The Secret Garden with The Color Purple) can feel rushed or hollow. Nottage, a nicely unsentimental writer, maneuvers the musical away from some cliches, neatly altering a couple of plot points, but stumbles on others. August\u2019s character, richly played and exquisitely sung by LaChanze, is nevertheless a variation on the Magical Negro trope and much of the musical forces black characters to teach a white character apiculture and love. The musical can\u2019t seem to decide whether to end on Rosaleen\u2019s political awakening or Lily\u2019s confrontation with her father, so it does both. (Gold and Nottage might want to think about reversing the order.) An awkward title, The Secret Life of Bees invites a nearly as awkward title song. But musically and emotionally, this is a lush and ardent work, sure to come to Broadway. After a few clunkers (most recently, Alice By Heart), Sheik again proves himself an adroit and flexible composer with a gift for ballads that seem to reach straight into your chest, the better to take a hold of your soul. This is easily his best work since Spring Awakening and his melodies will still whirr around in your head days and weeks after you hear them. If Birkenhead\u2019s lyrics sometimes reach for the rhyme too blatantly, others have grace and ease, especially the gospel and spirituals-inflected numbers. The acting is generally deft and the singing is splendid. Teeter doesn\u2019t try to soften Lily or make her too likable and Sengbloh neatly blends vulnerability and resolve. Brett Gray as Zachary, who works alongside Lily, is an absolute star in the making with his whispery tenor and dynamic physicality. There are also several standouts among the chorus. When their voices join it sounds like what a dripping honeycomb tastes like \u2013 so sweet, so fine, so abounding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
