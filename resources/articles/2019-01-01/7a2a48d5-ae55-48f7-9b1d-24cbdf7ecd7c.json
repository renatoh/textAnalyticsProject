On Wednesday, at his first press conference as Middlesex coach, Law had some kind words to say about West Indies, where he has just finished a two-year stretch as head coach, but some candid ones about the state of the game in Australia. \u201cThe staging of the Big Bash right in the middle of the Test summer probably isn\u2019t the smartest move,\u201d Law said. \u201cI keep hearing that the Big Bash is doing so well. If it\u2019s doing so well, play it in March. Don\u2019t take up the time of Test match cricket, because the boys should be playing red-ball cricket alongside the Test matches.\u201d Law, who played 54 ODIs and only a single Test in his 20-year career, said he felt \u201cAustralia have definitely got the talent\u201d but that \u201cthey\u2019ve just lost track of what\u2019s important\u201d. He thinks the time Steve Smith and David Warner have spent playing grade cricket this season will have helped with that. \u201cI think it will have given them an idea of what life is really about,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first started playing grade cricket in Brisbane, as a 15-year-old, I was sharing a dressing room with Allan Border. That doesn\u2019t happen much any more. Test players don\u2019t really play much club cricket when they\u2019re away from international duty, they\u2019re wrapped up in cotton wool and put away.\u201d Australia, Law said, should recall both men as soon as they can. As for West Indies, Law believes that England will start their upcoming series as \u201cred-hot favourites\u201d but \u201cif they aren\u2019t on their game,, then West Indies have the team to make an upset\u201d. Results were pretty patchy in the time Law was with the team but he feels that \u201ca core group of senior players\u201d have emerged and that they\u2019ve \u201cproved that they can do it\u201d. He listed Shai Hope, Kraigg Brathwaite, Jason Holder and Shannon Gabriel. \u201cIt comes down to self-belief. If they have that they can achieve anything they want.\u201d A lot of this England team will know that already,, of course, given West Indies\u2019 famous win at Headingley in 2017. \u201cThe euphoria of the first Test win in England in 17 years was something that\u2019s still celebrated in the Caribbean,\u201d Law said, \u201cThey don\u2019t need much to have a party out there.\u201d He felt it was pretty telling, though, that they could not follow up on that result in the next Test at Lord\u2019s, where they lost by nine wickets. But still Law feels West Indies are finally moving in the right direction. \u201cThere\u2019s been massive improvements. I know Johnny Grave, the CEO, and Jimmy Adams, the director of cricket, have made massive strides forward to make sure the level of professionalism has been raised. So the first team are in a healthy state.\u201d The one area that still needs work, Law said, is the domestic game. \u201cBut then it\u2019s very difficult to run on a shoestring budget or to produce superstars when there are hardly any practice facilities and no academy set-up. So that would be the next port of call. And it is in the pipeline. They\u2019re just waiting for funding to come through.\u201d Law said it had been a hard decision to quit but explained that he had been drawn to Middlesex because they had offered him a four-year contract, and the county job meant he would have the chance to spend more time with his immediate family, who live in England. He thinks Middlesex have the makings of a winning team. \u201cI\u2019ve just watched them train, and the skill level\u2019s great and the work ethic is fantastic. If we can add just a bit of steel to the mental side, we\u2019ll have a pretty good package,\u201d he said. \u201cI was tough mentally, a tough player verbally, so hopefully an ounce of toughness will rub off into the dressing room.\u201d It seems he\u2019s been told he needs to improve their white ball cricket in particular. He might even look to bring in one or two West Indian players to help him do it. \u201cShai Hope would be one I\u2019d target.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
