The Portuguese was barracked by a section of the home fans in the east stand during a fractious tie with chants of \u201cJudas\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re not special any more\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault\u201d, the last a reference to Chelsea being out of European competition this season. Mourinho responded by pointing to the turf and holding up three fingers at his detractors, signifying the trio of Premier League titles he claimed in two spells in south-west London. The United manager clashed with his opposite number following Mike Oliver\u2019s decision to dismiss Ander Herrera for two bookable offences, the second caution relatively soft, with the fourth official, Mike Jones, twice forced to keep them apart on the touchline as emotions ran high. \u201cThe fans can call me what they want,\u201d said Mourinho, who was sacked in December 2015 with Chelsea, the title holders at the time, 16th in the Premier League but safely through to the Champions League knockout phase. \u201cI am a professional. I defend my club. Until the moment [Chelsea] have a manager that wins four Premier Leagues for them, I\u2019m the No1. When they have somebody who wins four Premier Leagues for them, I\u2019ll be No2. For this moment, \u2018Judas\u2019 is No1.\u201d Herrera will now serve a two-match ban after his second dismissal of the campaign, while the Football Association may choose to scrutinise footage of Marcos Rojo\u2019s apparent stamp on Eden Hazard late on, which went unpunished. \u201cNobody saw us crying because we don\u2019t have Zlatan [Ibrahimovic], this or that,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cThe only thing we spoke about is the fact we are playing in Europe and our opponents aren\u2019t. You know ... our opponents could have been. I left the club last season in the Champions League having won the group, in the knockout phase playing the second leg at home. If they\u2019d won the Champions League last year, they\u2019d be playing in Europe this season. It\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s the [fault of the] ones who stayed here and didn\u2019t win the Champions League. What I share with them is that we didn\u2019t have a good Premier League, and I share responsibility with that.\u201d Conte, whose side now confront Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-final, shook hands with Mourinho in the tunnel post-match but was critical of his opponents\u2019 approach, suggesting United\u2019s eagerness to close the home side down had led to them resorting to kicking Hazard. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play football but for 25 minutes it was impossible for Hazard to play football,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cI see only that he got a lot of kicks. Only kicking. He started the game receiving kicks, and he finished receiving kicks. \u201cThis is not football for me. I don\u2019t think this can be a tactic. This is the truth. Everyone saw this. I think sometimes, when you play against players with great talent, you try and intimidate these players. I think the referee must protect this type of player. What happens if they are put out with a bad injury?\u201d The Chelsea manager suggested his regular verbal spats with Mourinho were nothing more than \u201ca circus\u201d. Mourinho described Oliver as \u201ca referee of fantastic potential\u201d and, having made a beeline for the officials after the final whistle, suggested he had merely gone to offer them \u201cmany congratulations\u201d. \u201cThere was a match until the moment Herrera saw the red card, and then there was another match after that,\u201d added Mourinho. \u201cBefore that I saw a game with the feeling I was going to win. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the guys. Mr Oliver... goes home and can do his own analysis because I don\u2019t want to analyse his work. Compare Herrera\u2019s second yellow card with the foul a couple of minutes later when [Marcus] Rashford goes to attack the space and the Chelsea captain [Gary Cahill] grabs him, stops him in a counter-attack. Mr Oliver does not give a card, not even a yellow.\u201d The other semi-final will see Arsenal take on Manchester City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
