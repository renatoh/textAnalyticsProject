The runaway premiers enjoyed the first of what should be two presentation ceremonies this season on Saturday, hoisting the Premiers\u2019 Plate aloft after a typically methodical dismantling of Newcastle Jets. It\u2019s good manners in moments like this to laud the best team in a competition, especially one a record margin ahead of its nearest challenger. But what more is there to say about the winningest team in an A-League season that hasn\u2019t been said already? We\u2019ve talked up the coach, drooled over the marquee No10, and marvelled at the collective ability to seize the moment. Anything else you care to factor into Sydney\u2019s peerless achievement has been raised somewhere between October and now during the 27 unbroken weeks the Sky Blues have topped the ladder. In situations like this the boundlessly creative Brian Eno turns to \u201coblique strategies\u201d. As David McNamee explains: \u201cThe oblique strategies was a set of cards created by Eno and his painter friend Peter Schmidt, and published as a signed limited edition in 1975. On each card is printed an (often quite abstract) instruction, which is invoked when an artist, producer or band has reached some form of creative impasse and requires external disruptive influence to suggest new ideas.\u201d Eno applies the technique to a range of creative pursuits but famously as a music producer. David Bowie, Devo, Talking Heads, and (don\u2019t hold it against him) Coldplay, have all used Eno and his oblique strategies to untie creative knots. I tried myself (using version three, published in 1979 and available as an app), to see if the cards could help me provide a fresh angle. They didn\u2019t. Turns out I\u2019m too rigid in my thinking for such a Dadaist experience. Nonetheless, the process revealed a tantalising insight: what if Graham Arnold was an oblique strategist? OK, I appreciate I\u2019m stretching the bounds of probability, but a look through the cards reveals a series of statements and questions that could have been scrawled on a training ground whiteboard at the end of last season. Some of the cards that apply to Sydney are so general they could apply to many successful enterprises. \u201cWhat mistakes did you make last time?\u201d for example, would have occurred in the 2015-16 debrief regardless, signposting an off-season recruitment strategy focussed on dependability. Likewise \u201cConsult other sources \u2013 promising \u2013 unpromising\u201d, is now a staple of high performance culture, but that shouldn\u2019t downplay the value of Arnold seeking the counsel of Michael Cheika, Wayne Bennett and Trent Robinson. \u201cThe ball might be a different shape, and the rules and tactics are different, but the biggest thing now \u2013 probably the biggest thing in football - is how you manage people and get the best out of people, so we use that,\u201d Arnold said in February. Other cards carry more specific weight. The famous \u201cghost echoes\u201d can be seen in the Central Coast Mariners old boys Arnold brought to his squad in the pre-season, to team up once again with the totemic Matt Simon and fitness coach and ex-Mariner Andrew Clark, the most frequently name-checked member of any team\u2019s backroom staff. \u201cDo nothing for as long as possible\u201d could easily refer to Sydney\u2019s strategy of grinding teams into submission in the second half of matches. Sixty-nine percent of Sydney\u2019s goals have arrived after half-time and on ten occasions their opening goal arrived in the second term. \u201cNot building a wall but making a brick\u201d elegantly describes the team-wide approach to defending that enabled the highest-scoring team in the league to keep a ridiculous 16 clean sheets. Perhaps more by luck than design, Sydney FC satisfied one of the most innovative creative planning processes. Football Federation Australia could benefit from a session with the cards. The one-horse race of a home and away season petered out months ago as a contest, highlighting the urgent need to introduce more teams and stoke fresh narratives. Despite an enthralling final round overflowing with what Eno would recognise as \u201cidiot glee\u201d, little of the attacking abandon on display carried much significance. Instead of a crescendo building like Bowie\u2019s Eno-inspired Heroes we\u2019ve long been sleepwalking into the finals to the sounds of Ambient 1: Music for Airports. That the final five matches were stretched across three days against the backdrop of an Easter weekend lessened the tension even further \u2013 for the diehards that paid any attention that is. Other football leagues play their final round of matches simultaneously so the excitement is stretched to breaking point across the country. The most vital and captivating in Australia\u2019s was snuck away on pay TV on Sunday night, a day after the Premiers\u2019 Plate had already been raised. If FFA does open a deck of oblique strategy cards, it would be serendipitous if they pulled out \u201cTowards the insignificant\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
