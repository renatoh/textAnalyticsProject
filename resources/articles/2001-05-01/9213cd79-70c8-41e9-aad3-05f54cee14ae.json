After a few milliseconds in the sun, my skin turns an agonising red. I once got sunburned on a beach in Suffolk in September on a cloudy day. A lucky charm: The nearest I let myself get to a lucky charm is a bit of tartan ribbon my mother once tied on to my rucksack when I was disappearing off to Asia for a year. She said it was remind me to come home again. I still have it there and goes with me on every trip. A memento: A miniature plastic sheep, for reasons I can't explain. Sorry. A luxury: My ancient Nikon FM2, which weighs a ton. It takes great failsafe photos, though, and doubles up as a useful nutcracker/hammer/ object to hit muggers with. If only: I'd love to take Isabella Lucy Bird, but she's been dead for 97 years. She was diagnosed with some mysterious delicate condition, but instead of taking to her chaise longue, decided to travel alone all over Japan, Australia, Hawaii, America, Tibet and Persia. She'd make an interesting companion. \u0095 Maggie O'Farrell's first novel, After You'd Gone, is published by Headline Review at \u00a36.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
