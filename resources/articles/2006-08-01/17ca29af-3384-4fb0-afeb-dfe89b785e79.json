At the heart of the escalating death toll is the belief that force is the only effective solution to problems. Many party members supported the invasion of Iraq as the culmination of progressive interventionism - a multi-faceted approach combining support for nation-building, poverty reduction, promoting democracy and pluralism - with the use of force to protect these steps in a context of ethnic conflict and failed states. But Iraq was the end of the strategy, and its replacement by neoconservative dogma. Neoconservatives believe in the use of force alone to promote US interests and impose a one-dimensional model of democracy. In his embrace of military solutions, President Bush has become the chief recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida. To our shame, Prime Minister Blair is his compliant corporal. Cllr Steve Munby Lab, Liverpool I find it hard to understand why, when Britain took part in the invasion of Iraq, most of Tony Blair's cabinet supported it, as did most of the Labour party. And yet when Tony Blair refuses to criticise Israel, almost all of the political world is against him. Is this because people just want a stick with which to beat Tony Blair, or because whatever Israel does, it will be criticised by both left and right? Andrew Lee-Hart Wallasey, Merseyside I consider the prime minister's stance on the crisis in Israel and Lebanon to be both morally and prudentially sound and an exemplification \"of everything that the Labour party ostensibly stands for\". If Peter Kilfoyle (Letters, August 7) finds the outstanding foreign policy of a Labour prime minister so unpalatable, then the remedy is in his hands. Jamie Milne Chair, Epsom &amp; Ewell CLP Everyone has a right to a vision for the world, including Tony Blair, but the Lebanese people have an even greater right to a vision for their country. Two months ago, they thought they were achieving that. They had a democratically elected government, had rebuilt their country and even tourism was returning. What meaning does Mr Blair's vision have for the people of the four countries whose people have died and whose infrastructure has been destroyed, largely by western arms? Maybe those countries should define a vision for the west. Christine Saunders Hampton, Middlesex"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
