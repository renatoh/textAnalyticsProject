The measure, to go into effect for about a month, will enable local authorities to urge people to stay at home except to shop for food, seek medical care, go to work if necessary, and take daily exercise. \u201cWe hope to declare a state of emergency as early as tomorrow after listening to the opinions of the advisory panel,\u201d Abe told reporters on Monday evening. \u201cWe are seeing rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka. \u201cConsidering that medical institutions are facing a critical situation, I have received opinions that the government should prepare to declare a state of emergency.\u201d Abe\u2019s apparent reluctance to implement tougher measures earlier in the crisis had drawn criticism from the Japan Medical Association and Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, where confirmed cases have surged in the past week. Japan has avoided the large number of Covid-19 cases and deaths that have prompted lockdowns in other countries, but there is growing alarm over the rise in infections in the capital, particularly among young people. Tokyo reported a record 148 new cases on Sunday, with a further 83 on Monday taking its total to over 1,000, according to the public broadcaster NHK. The majority of confirmed cases over the weekend involved people aged below 50, with many in their 20s and 30s. More than 3,500 people have tested positive and 85 have died from the virus in Japan, NHK said. While the figures are low compared to the US, China and parts of Europe, officials are concerned that a surge in infections could place intolerable strain on the country\u2019s hospitals. The declaration will allow the governors of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures to call on people to stay at home and businesses to close, but they will not have the legal authority to impose the kind of lockdowns seen in other countries, or to fine residents who ignore the request. \u201cIf you ask me if we can enforce a lockdown like France, the answer is no,\u201d Abe told MPs last week. He is also expected to unveil \u201cunprecedented\u201d stimulus measures in response to the \u201cbiggest crisis\u201d the global economy has faced since the second world war, according to a draft document. The 108 trillion yen (\u00a3800bn) package, which has yet to be finalised, would be much bigger than the country\u2019s response in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis. Koike has voiced concern over the high number of untraced cases and growing pressure on the city\u2019s hospitals, and supports a \u201csoft\u201d lockdown to protect the city\u2019s 14 million residents. Legal revisions passed last month gave Abe scope to declare a state of emergency if the coronavirus outbreak posed a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to public health and threatened serious damage to the world\u2019s third-biggest economy, which is now on the brink of recession. Officials are hoping peer pressure will encourage people to stay at home and to practise social distancing when they go out. Businesses that refuse to cooperate face being publicly named and shamed. In addition, local leaders will be able to requisition facilities to use as temporary medical centres and order the closure of schools and other gathering places such as theatres, music venues and stadiums. Most of the country\u2019s schools have been closed for more than a month following a request by Abe. His declaration is initially expected to target the greater Tokyo metropolitan area \u2013 with a population of more than 36 million \u2013 along with Osaka and five other areas. Under the declaration, hospitals will be able to transfer people with mild symptoms to specially designated hotels to free up medical facilities for more serious cases, local media reported. Abe has faced accusations that he and other officials started seriously addressing the outbreak only after it became inevitable that the Olympics, initially due to be held in Tokyo this summer, would have to be postponed. Schools and many other public facilities have been closed for a month, and some companies are allowing employees to work from home, but calls to avoid socialising at bars and restaurants have failed to resonate. Citing evidence of infection clusters in entertainment districts, Koike has urged residents to stay at home for the past two weekends and to avoid crowded places until 12 April. The message appeared to have got through this weekend, with several restaurant chains and shops, along with the capital\u2019s ubiquitous pachinko and karaoke parlours, closing their doors. Rail and subway operators are also reporting dramatic falls in passenger numbers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
