I\u2019ve been in the kitchen since I was nine and by 13 I could cook a full feast for 20. Mother would never call herself a feminist but I love that she taught her daughter to cook and insisted her sons did too. Dad passed away when I was very young, but he\u2019d never made food. I\u2019m definitely the best cook in my family and they all realise that, 100%. It frustrates Mother but she knows it\u2019s true. Until about two years ago the only thing my husband could make was a very nice chicken dumpling soup. He\u2019d make it every few months, but that\u2019s possibly because I\u2019m a nightmare in the kitchen, always thinking I know a better way. Since my life changed dramatically, making Queer Eye, he\u2019s taken on more responsibility and I return to roasted chicken and vegetables with balsamic honey. He\u2019s on a souffle kick at the moment. He\u2019s made one every day for the last two weeks. The first food I remember is roti, the Pakistani go-to. If Mum had been working late, she\u2019d make roti flatbread in one minute \u2013 OK, a minute and a half. Prepared from scratch, with a little butter and sugar. I didn\u2019t eat a lot of non-Pakistani food as a kid, I just found it too bland. I found it funny that Mum always called food \u201cEnglish\u201d when it was derived from Italy or China or any country other than Pakistan. Until I was eight or nine I took packed lunches to school. Friends would say, \u201cYour food smells bad\u201d, but nothing really mean. They would tease me about it but were always curious to taste it, to the extent that I never had enough left for me. Then I started having school lunches. It\u2019s strange how many people moan about them because I loved the desserts. There was a sponge with orangey glaze on top served with pink custard. I thought it was beautiful. In 2008 I moved to the US part-time, living mostly in Salt Lake City, and I\u2019ve been here full-time for four and a half years. My husband is Mormon. Funeral potatoes [potato casserole] are very much part of his culture. I\u2019ve found them, and also potluck, a big Mormon thing, at LGBT events. LGBT people love a potluck more than anything. As a teenager, I\u2019d spend a few weeks every year in Bury at a factory where my grandfather made denim for Disney. That was probably my favourite place as a kid. I\u2019d hit up a local kebab restaurant a few streets away, which did wonderful samosas and was run by a friend of my grandad. The things I learned in his factory set me up for working at Zara and Selfridges, and everything I\u2019ve done since. Whenever I return to the UK I go to Nando\u2019s with friends, which I love very much. \u201cGoing Nando\u2019s\u201d reminds me of being 19. I\u2019d heard about the American restaurant chain Olive Garden on my favourite show, Will &amp; Grace. They had a couple of friends who\u2019d always want to go to an Olive Garden but Will and Grace would get really frustrated by the choice. Anyway, early on, my now husband and I were communicating online. He wanted to hang out and I said, \u201cOK, we\u2019ll go to lunch, if we go to an Olive Garden.\u201d He replied \u201cWhy on earth? They\u2019re totally uninteresting.\u201d I insisted: \u201cIf you want a date, that is where I want to go.\u201d It had bland food and terrible decor, but I thought, \u201cIf he can keep me wildly entertained at the most boring restaurant on the planet, maybe he\u2019s a keeper.\u201d What I always say when a meal is perfect and delicious is, \u201cThis is fucking wicked\u201d, after a really wide-eyed look to everybody at the table. My favourite things Food Cake, chocolate preferably. Almost any meal I have is finished off with some cake or other. Coffee First thing in the morning I grind Starbucks\u2019 standard Pike Place Roast. I\u2019ll have two cups. And here\u2019s the thing \u2013 I\u2019ll only ever drink half of each cup. Restaurant My London go-to is Tayyabs, in Whitehall, or is it Whitechapel? I always mix the two up. In LA, it\u2019s Little Dom\u2019s deli."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
