The tournament kicks off with Egypt against Zimbabwe at 10pm local time on Friday and seven of its group stage fixtures are scheduled for 4.30pm local time (3.30 BST), when the searing heat has not yet abated. Fifpro, the global players\u2019 union, is worried that the organisers\u2019 efforts to mitigate for the afternoon sun are insufficient and has requested that the Confederation of African Football (Caf) considers delaying kick-offs if conditions are potentially dangerous. \u201cWe expect the heat and humidity at Afcon 2019 to be extremely challenging for players,\u201d a Fifpro statement read. \u201cWe are particularly concerned about the seven group matches scheduled to start at 16:30 local time in Alexandria, Cairo and Suez. While we appreciate the tournament organiser has a duty to meet the scheduling of television rights holders, the health and safety of the players must come first.\u201d On Saturday, the Democratic Republic of the Congo face Uganda in the first of those late-afternoon games. Had it been played on Thursday, the temperature at kick-off would have been 39C (102F). Even allowing for a forecasted drop to 37C at the weekend, the conditions hardly look conducive to competitive football, and hotter weather is expected next week. Ivory Coast, featuring Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha, are among the teams who will face a similar issue. Games in Alexandria, which has a more coastal climate, appear less problematic than in the other cities. Fifa assesses the possible effects of heat stress by using the \u201cwet bulb globe thermometer\u201d (WBGT) measurement \u2013 in layman\u2019s terms, the temperature recorded when a thermometer is covered in a water-soaked cloth. When the WBGT, which comes in lower than the air temperature at anything beneath 100% relative humidity, reaches 34C the risk of thermal injury is said to be \u201cextreme\u201d, according to Fifa\u2019s guidelines. Seemingly in response to such concerns Caf \u2013 to which Tunisia are among the teams who have voiced reservations \u2013 released the findings of a medical report on its media channel. It calculated that, with an average temperature in June and July of between 35-38C, the high WBGT will be \u201cabove 32 degrees\u201d. Caf said it will accommodate three-minute breaks, with cold drinks and wet towels for players and officials, in the 30th and 75th minutes, as per Fifa recommendations, if necessary. But Fifpro, while noting Caf\u2019s advice, believes it should go further. \u201cWe have also suggested in our letter to Caf the possibility of additional breaks in the 15th and 60th minutes based on scientific research,\u201d Fifpro said, citing data that shows an athlete can ingest and digest a maximum of 200\u2011250ml of fluid every 15 to 20 minutes. There is no indication whether such additional breaks will be formalised. The temperature on Friday when Egypt face Zimbabwe is likely to be around 28C (82F)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
