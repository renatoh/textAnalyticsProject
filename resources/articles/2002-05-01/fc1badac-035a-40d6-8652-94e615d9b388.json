The castle looms over the city to remind us of the latter, while the former manifests itself as a feeling that you might be missing something if you go any time other than August. The reality couldn't be more different, because Edinburgh is a pocket-sized gem of a city, with sparkling sea water at its edges and a volcanic mountain in its centre. In between, you'll find bars made for wasting time and streets perfect for wandering around. It's an ideal weekend city, easily navigated on foot and with the help of any number of friendly people willing to give directions. I was lucky enough to meet two elderly ladies in Princes Street who not only told me how to get to the Royal Mile but, unprompted, pointed out where I would find a ladies' loo on the way. It will always remain a mystery how these magical people knew I badly needed to visit one. The feeling is of a city whose slow rhythm is punctuated by the insistent beat of new development. Nowhere is it more evident than around Holyrood Park. Edinburgh's volcano, Arthur's Seat, is more than 350 million years old, but new apartment buildings, the multimedia centre, Our Dynamic Earth, and not least the new Scottish Parliament, jostle for position around its base as rollerbladers whizz along its lower paths. In shopping and fashion too, Edinburgh is positioning itself as the new kid on the block, and shortbread and tartan don't get a look in. The opening of a Harvey Nichols branch, always the stamp of approval for any style-conscious city, is scheduled for August, in the Walk, Edinburgh's first new street since 1800. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on Jenners, the oldest privately-owned department store in the world, and a city institution. It's well worth a visit to this Princes Street store before the newcomers overshadow it. Touted as the jewel in the shopping crown is the Ocean Terminal shopping centre in the port of Leith, but it's much like malls the world over and really only worth a visit for the spectacular view of the water, or for a meal at the new Conran restaurant, the Zinc Bar and Grill (0131 553 8070). Mention Leith to people from Edinburgh, though, and the first thing they'll say is 'up and coming' rather than 'shopping centre'. Formerly a fiercely independent town, Leith merged with Edinburgh in 1920 and now runs seamlessly into the New Town by way of Leith Walk, a strip of nail bars and Chinese supermarkets. Down by the water, the sky is punctured by cranes hauling up new apartment buildings from the shore of this old whaling port, and you can while away the time in any one of a number of bistros. Even old favourites are changing to keep up with the times. A venerable hotel, the enchanting Witchery, always booked up to the hilt due to its tiny capacity, is opening four new rooms next month. Literary tours have previously focused on Burns et al, but a new one to be started in August by Mercat (0131 557 6464; www. mercattours.com) will include less salubrious areas featured in the modern crime fiction of Ian Rankin. To try to keep up with all the new things Edinburgh has to offer would be a mistake, however. Fascinating chat spills out of pubs as you stroll around, unable to tear your eyes away from some of the most beautiful architecture in Britain until it's too dark to see, and you sample a cocktail or enjoy a meal that has nothing to do with haggis. Go now, before the festival crowds, and soak up the atmosphere of this glorious city as the sunshine begins to bounce off the twinkling sea and warm your skin. If you only do five things 1. Explore Edinburgh's docklands area, Leith, by taking the 16, 35, 11 or 22 bus from Princes Street. Home to the Malmaison Hotel, 1 Tower Place (0131 468 5000; www.malmaison.com), proof if proof were needed of Leith's up and coming status. Even if you're not staying there, you can pop into the caf\u00e9 or bar for a drink. The hotel is at the bottom of The Shore, the main waterfront street in Leith, which is well worth a wander. It's dotted with bistros, the best of which is The Shore, 2-4 The Shore (0131 553 5080). On the corner is a friendly deli-caf\u00e9, The Clock, where crusty bread and lattes will take the edge off your seaside appetite. The Royal Yacht Britannia (0131 555 5566; www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk), now part of Leith's Ocean Terminal complex, gives up to two hours' entertainment and could be invaluable on a rainy day, especially for families. An audio guide will take you around four decks, where you'll see the Queen's and Duke of Edinburgh's bedrooms and works of art from the royal collection. Adults \u00a37.75, Children, \u00a33.75, Admission 9.30am-4.30pm. 2. Visit Our Dynamic Earth, HolyRood Road, EH8 (0131 550 7800; www.dynamicearth.co.uk), an environmental visitor attraction at the foot of Arthur's seat that kids love and adults won't mind taking them around. Its slogan is 'Live 2,400 million years in one day', so you start off in a Time Machine that takes you back to Big Bang before heading through galleries that chart the development of the Earth through interactive exhibitions (play God, using a computer to make Antarctica melt to see what will happen if the global warming continues) and informative voiceovers. The kids there seemed to love it and adults get their reward in the airy caf\u00e9. The BBC Walking with Dinosaurs exhibition arrives on 15 July. Buses 24, 25. 3. Take a walk on Arthur's Seat. The dormant volcano is a pastoral oasis in the heart of Edinburgh, looming over the new Scottish Parliament and Holyrood Park. Its steep sides are studded with gorse and walkers weave their way along its paths. Salisbury Crags makes an easy walk and gives great views of the Old Town. If that's too much effort, stay at sea level and visit the Palace of Holyrood House (0131 556 1096), the Queen's residence in Edinburgh. Buses 24, 25. 4. Wander through the New Town, north of Princes Street. The beautiful Georgian houses and gracious squares and crescents are perfect for an afternoon's aimless walking, particularly if it's sunny. George Street is where a lot of the shopping action is, but go north up Frederick Street and through Queen Street Gardens for residential splendour. If you want to find out what it's like behind those closed doors, visit the Georgian House, 7 Charlotte Square (0131 226 3318; www.nts.org.uk). Designed by Robert Adam and refurbished by the National Trust for Scotland, it's fitted out as it would have been when rich businessman John Lamont lived here in the early nineteenth century. Helpful guides bring the whole thing to life. 5. Pamper yourself at the rooftop One Spa at the Sheraton Grand Hotel, 8 Conference Square (0131 221 7777; www.one-spa.com) Treatments include the ESPA Ayurvedic Holistic Body Treatment (\u00a3110 for two hours) Where to Eat Splashing out Rogue, 67 Morrison Street (0131 228 2700; www.rogues-uk.com). The newest addition to Edinburgh's fine collection of eateries is well worth the short cab ride to the city's financial district. The lighting is low and there's very little in the room that's not cream (except for the waiters' uniforms, which are, of course, black). It's something of a relief that the food is actually good. The monkfish with boudin noir was subtle but meaty, and the pineapple soup for pudding was a risk that paid off. The bill came to \u00a370 for two, including service. French Frugality Petit Paris, 38 Grassmarket (0131 226 2442). Whitewashed walls, gingham tablecloths, little vases of flowers and a bunch of baguettes thrown down casually next to the cash register; this is a little slice of French heaven in the middle of Edinburgh. There's even a waitress who is a Julie Delpy lookalike. The best thing about it, though, is its fantastic \u00a35 deal that offers one of the dishes of the day with coffee to follow. And the dishes on offer are very decent; navarin of lamb, moules marinieres, or poached Toulouse sausage with lentil stew. All such good value, you can afford to wash it down with lots of wine. Quick Bites Caf\u00e9 Hub, The Hub, Royal Mile (0131 473 2067). Perfectly situated for a bite to eat as you dash down the Royal Mile, Caf\u00e9 Hub is in the converted church that's the centre of the Edinburgh Festival. Painted a cheerful yellow, it has a varying menu that includes sandwiches (such as feta, fennel, roast aubergine, \u00a33.60), soups (such as tomato and red onion salsa, \u00a32.85) as well as salads and more substantial meals. Room for the night Luxury The Witchery by the Castle, Castlehill, The Royal Mile (0131 225 5613; www.thewitchery.com). \u00a3195 per suite per night. The Witchery is right in the middle of the action, but it's so gorgeous you'll have difficulty leaving your room to go out. 'Lavish' is an understatement for the way these generously proportioned rooms are decorated with antiques, tapestries and drapes. It might be sensory overload for some people, but this is the place for those who like their beds four-poster and their baths designed for two. Classy mid-range The Bonham, 35 Drumsheugh Gardens (0131 226 6050. www.thebonham.com). Doubles from \u00a3170 per night or \u00a369 per person per night as a special weekend deal. Boutique hotels aren't always renowned for their friendliness, but the Bonham, a converted Victorian townhouse, combines cool minimalism with warm service. Large rooms are comfortable without drowning you in drapery. The wood-panelled dining room does a fantastic Scottish breakfast and creative continental breakfast, and is a destination in itself for dinner. Special mention has to go to the bathroom in Room 1 for the free-standing copper rolltop bath. Budget Bar Java, 48-50 Constitution Street, Leith, 0131 553 2020. Doubles \u00a340. Budget accommodation in Edinburgh is becoming increasingly difficult to find. The chains such as Jury's and Ibis offer good value, but little character. For a room under \u00a350, it's necessary to head out of town to Bar Java in Leith. Ten rooms, each named after an island (Skye, Iona, etc) nestle in a small building across the beer garden from the bar. Rooms are simple but comfortable. Behaving badly Edinburgh's licensing laws are the most civilised in the country. Bars and clubs can stay open until 3am, which is just as well considering how many good ones there are. The Dome, 14 George Street (0131 624 8624; www.thedomeedinburgh.com) is a good place to start. Le tout New Town passes through this converted bank on a night out, to sit under palm trees and the amazing glass-domed ceiling, to drink cocktails and watch one another. The doorstaff can be picky and it feels a bit like the kind of place footballers might hangout in but don't let that put you off: it makes a stunning setting to start the night off. Staying on George Street, you can do Sex and the City, Caledonian style at the newly-opened Opal Lounge, 51 George Street (0131 226 2275; www.opallounge.co.uk), where Prince William is rumoured to have dropped in. Moody lighting is offset by a lively crowd and a great cocktail menu (try the chocolate martini). There are leather upholstered booths for comfortable drinking. Edinburgh is following London's trend towards bar-clubs, where you can either sip cocktails in a civilised manner or lose it on the dance floor after you've had too many. The Opal Lounge is such a place, with DJs until 3am. Anyone willing to make a trip to the old town on a night out will be well-rewarded by Beluga Bar and Canteen, 30a Chambers Street (0131 624 4545; www.festival-inns.co.uk). Follow the fine young things down the spiral staircase, to a moody den. Fitted out with low lights and lots of chocolate-coloured leather, it's got plenty of seats for lounging and is surprisingly roomy for a basement bar. DJs play late here too. The clubbing scene in Edinburgh hasn't taken off the way it has in Glasgow, but keep an eye on The List listings magazine for acts appearing in Club Mercado, The Venue, or the old reliable Po Na Na. Don't even think about Wearing trainers on a night out. Many otherwise lovely pubs and clubs still follow the archaic principle of refusing entry to people who aren't wearing 'proper' shoes, ignoring the fact that trainers can be a million times more stylish - not to mention expensive - than nasty slip-on black leather shoes with gold chains. We assume they will realise this eventually, but until then keep your trainers for daytime wear. Objects of desire Indulge your sweet tooth. Casey's, 52 St Mary's Street (0131 556 6082) is an Edinburgh institution, a tiny shop piled high with jars of old-fashioned sweets doled out by a bustling lady in a lavender housecoat. You can keep your blood sugar up as you go sightseeing with acid drops or butter liquorice. Around the corner, you'll find Plaisir du Chocolat, 251- 253 Canongate (0131 556 9524) selling slabs of Valrhona chocolate, as well as loose chocolate sweets such as ganache rum, lavender and bergamot. For local design talent, Concrete Butterfly, 317 - 319 Cowgate (0131 558 7130) is well worth a look. Beautiful handwoven lambswool throws by Pick One in muted shades can be had for \u00a3200 and the Tessuti range of crockery starts at \u00a39.60 for a side plate. Next door is its counterpart, Concrete Wardrobe, for stylish clothes and accessories. Indulge your passion for vintage clothing without breaking the bank. Armstrong's, 83 The Grassmarket (0131 220 5557) is a cornucopia that would put Portobello market to shame; you'll find satin dresses (from \u00a330), vintage lace that will make anyone trying to do this season's peasant look very happy (from \u00a316) and gorgeous kimono-style wraps and robes (from \u00a315). The staff, who all look like extras from Grease or Gone with the Wind, are very helpful. There's never been a better time to buy new interpretations of formerly kitschy Scottish favourites. Howie Nicholsby, son of venerable kiltmaker Geoffrey has launched his own line called 21st Century Kilts at Geoffrey (Tailor), 57 - 59 High Street, Royal Mile (0131 557 0256; www.21stcenturykilts.co.uk) with kilts so desirable that celebs such as Robbie Williams and Ewan McGregor are wearing them. Funky tartans and camouflage prints can be had from about \u00a3200. Edinburghers might not be as label conscious as their Glaswegian counterparts, but that doesn't mean you won't find high fashion here. Corniche, 2 Jeffrey Street (0131 556 3707) is a boutique that stocks Maharishi, Yohji Yamamoto, Katherine Hamnett, Comme des Garcons among others in its women's shop, while next door in the men's boutique you'll find Maria Chen and Oswald Boateng. For upmarket high street shops, George Street is the place to go. Get Out of Town Edinburgh isn't exactly the sort of place you go to for a beach break, but it would be a pity to ignore the many lovely little resorts close by (even if your experience will be more more wind-blown than sun-drenched). North Berwick This is probably the best known. Its long, sandy beaches are perfect for getting away from the city. It also boasts the Scottish Seabird Centre, an award-winning attraction with live links to the seabird colonies on Bass Rock (01620 890 202). ScotRail runs regular services from Waverley station, Edinburgh. Inquiries 0845 748 49 50. Stirling If you haven't had your fill of history in Edinburgh, head 40 miles north to Stirling. A university population keeps things fairly lively in the city centre but the castle is the real draw. It has seen centuries of turbulent history and still keeps a stately watch from the top of a mound of volcanic rock. Phone 01786 4500 000 for opening hours. Trains depart regularly from Waverley station, and bus services leave from St Andrew's Square (08705 50 50 50). Getting There Scotrail (08457 55 00 33; www.scotrail.co.uk runs a sleeper service to Edinburgh, from London Euston, stopping at Watford Junction and Carlisle. Prices start at \u00a389 return. GNER (08457 225 225; www.gner.co.uk runs services from London King's Cross to Edinburgh. Prices from \u00a351 (apex). Go Airlines (0870 607 6543; www.go-fly.com offers flights from \u00a338 return including taxes from Stansted; from Bristol and East Midlands airport from \u00a330; and from Belfast for \u00a320. Getting Around Buses are reliable, frequent and full of people willing to tell you where you need to get off, as long as you let them call you 'hen'. Buses take exact change only, so carry plenty or risk paying more than you need. Most fares are 80p or you can buy a day-pass for \u00a31.50 on any bus. You can hire black cabs on the street, but if you want to be sure of getting somewhere after dark, it's best to book a mini cab through your hotel. What the tourist board doesn't say \u00b7 When I asked a local woman which areas she would advise tourists to avoid, she sniffed and said, 'We don't really go in for bad areas here, dearie'. She has a point, but some residential areas are as deprived as any in Glasgow. Most visitors are unlikely go near most of them, but one place to look out for is Cowgate. It adjoins the Grassmarket and can form part of a lovely day's wandering and shopping. There are signs, however, that it can be tricky at night. The evening we strayed there we found vomit, broken glass and policemen clearing up after a fight. \u00b7 The Royal Mile is gracious, historic and in many ways it is not to be missed, but some of it is over-run with touristy shops of the shortbread and sporran variety.
