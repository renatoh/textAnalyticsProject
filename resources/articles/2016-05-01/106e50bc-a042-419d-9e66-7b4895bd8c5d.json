The Late Late Show host revealed he had never been invited to appear on the BBC1 celebrity dancing programme, but said he is \u201creally into dancing at the moment\u201d. \u201cI was up at 7am today to do a fitness dance class,\u201d Corden told the Radio Times. \u201cIt was just me and 20 women doing something called PlyoJam, which is basically a huge amount of jumping and dancing around. \u201cI absolutely love it because it\u2019s the first exercise I\u2019ve done that doesn\u2019t feel like a chore. I started doing it because I\u2019m hosting the Tony awards and I need to get used to dancing and singing at the same time.\u201d Corden, who found fame through BBC3 sitcom Gavin and Stacey, has made his love of the BBC and Strictly well known. Last week he highlighted the show alongside other popular favourites such as the Great British Bake Off when he described the corporation as the \u201ccornerstone of everything Britain stands for\u201d ahead of Thursday\u2019s government white paper on the next BBC charter. Corden\u2019s singing has already been regularly on display on The Late Late Show\u2019s popular Carpool Karaoke segment, which is getting its own spin-off. Acts including Adele, One Direction and Gwen Stefani have all sung along with Corden while driving around Los Angeles, but Corden revealed he would also \u201clove\u201d to have Beyonc\u00e9, Bruno Mars or Kanye West ride along. He also revealed that The Late Late Show had tried to get Donald Trump to appear \u201cwithout success several times\u201d, saying the format made it difficult for politicians because guests are brought on at the same time, making it a \u201cmuch less controllable atmosphere\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
