The head of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland (PFNI) said on Wednesday that no one should be above the law. The intervention of the federation\u2019s chair, Mark Lindsay, in the debate over the Troubles\u2019 legacy is at odds with the demands of the Conservative party leadership contender and defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt. She has backed calls for military veterans of the Northern Irish conflict to be covered by amnesty from prosecution. But Lindsay, who speaks for about 7,000 officers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, also demanded that serving and retired personnel be given the same access to legal aid as law firms that are seeking to prosecute security forces\u2019 veterans over controversial Troubles killings. On legacy and mainly Tory-led demands for a military amnesty, Lindsay told the PFNI\u2019s annual conference in Belfast: \u201cThere cannot be two different evidential thresholds. As police officers, both serving and retired, we have never sought to be treated any differently than other sections of our communities. A crime is a crime no matter who committed it.\u201d Referring to the IRA and loyalist paramilitary forces, which were responsible for the majority of violent deaths between 1969 and 1997, Lindsay continued: \u201cThose who caused the bloodshed and mayhem must not be allowed to escape justice simply because their actions are weighed against a less rigorous legal test. \u201cIt is perverse to set up institutions which will seek to investigate retired officers, whilst we have already had to release terrorist prisoners from prison, grant pardons and issue comfort letters. Let\u2019s not forget also, that decommissioning [of IRA and loyalist weapons] legislation enabled terrorist groups to destroy ballistic and forensic evidence.\u201d He claimed there was a risk of \u201ccreating a new community of victims\u201d among former and retired police officers who will \u201chave to delve into their pensions and savings to mount their own legal defences\u201d in legacy investigations. Lindsay added: \u201cThe imbalance of the accuser getting seemingly unlimited legal aid, while the accused former officer is left to his or her own devices is not lost on anyone. That is wrong on every level. It is blatant discrimination.\u201d After a New IRA booby-trap murder attempt on a police officer at a Belfast golf club earlier this week, Lindsay said a recent PFNI workforce survey showed morale was low among nine out of 10 officers in the region. The unilateral pursuit of police officers and security force personnel over the Troubles would only compound that rock bottom morale, Lindsay said. He warned that the glorification of the murder of police officers even 100 years ago in the first shots of the Irish war of independence helped \u201cradicalise the young people of today\u201d and excused the murder of his officers in the 21st century. In April this year a former paratrooper known as Soldier F was prosecuted for the murder of two people at a civil rights march on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. Soldier F\u2019s cause has been championed by former army generals and Conservative MPs including the current defence secretary. Last month, Mordaunt said serving and retired troops should be covered by an amnesty that included conflicts stretching from Iraq and Afghanistan all the way back 50 years to the start of the Northern Ireland Troubles. So far, the government and the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, have resisted military veterans and their supporters\u2019 demands for a blanket amnesty for troops in both present and past wars. Police officers, both serving and retired, have opposed moves towards amnesties because it could lead to a catch-all amnesty regime that would also absolve former paramilitaries from prosecution over past Troubles crimes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
