The incident is thought to have occurred in the second half at Old Trafford. While Shaw could be seen complaining to the assistant referee, Andrew Garrett, it was shrugged off, with the left-back displeased with the response. This may suggest that if Sakho did strike Shaw, as is claimed, it was not seen by either Garrett, the match referee, Lee Mason, or any of the officials. If so, this is would allows the FA to investigate if they deem there is a case to answer. This would be done by examining television pictures to discover if there is any conclusive evidence. English football\u2019s governing body expect to have Mason\u2019s report on the match by Monday morning, so will decide if any further action is required then, and Shaw refused to discuss the incident. However, a source close to him claimed that Sakho had headbutted the defender during the game and left him unhappy over the incident. Shaw may have hinted at the episode when talking of Wayne Rooney\u2019s 60th-minute red card for hacking at Stewart Downing. \u201cWe have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza\u2019s red card, as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn\u2019t stop play,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me but I just focus on winning games and I\u2019ll keep doing that.\u201d If Sakho, a 24-year-old Senegal striker who scored West Ham\u2019s consolation goal at Old Trafford, was found guilty of the offence he would face a lengthy ban. Chelsea\u2019s Ramires received a four-match suspension for an off-the-ball incident in which he elbowed Sunderland\u2019s Sebastian Larsson towards the end of last season. West Ham had not responded at the time of going to press. Shaw was finally making his debut for United after arriving in a \u00a327m deal this summer from Southampton. The 19-year-old had been ruled out with a hamstring injury and he conceded: \u201cIt was a tough debut, I would say. Obviously, we went down to 10 men and it\u2019s never easy but we all fought hard and showed how much we wanted these three points. It means a lot to us. I\u2019m glad we got the three points in the end. Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with how my debut went but the main thing, for me, was to get the win.\u201d Louis van Gaal criticised Shaw over his fitness during the club\u2019s summer tour of the US but the left-back stated he has a strong relationship with the manager. \u201cOf course, he was right to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a discussion in pre-season and the plan for me was to get my fitness up. It worked, I think, apart from the injury. It was a bit of a setback but I\u2019ve worked hard in the last weeks and had some talks. He\u2019s been a great inspiration to me and hopefully I can carry that on. For him to say I\u2019m an example at a massive club like this is something to be really happy about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
