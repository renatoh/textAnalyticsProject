A total rebuild is a daunting prospect, yet the Building Schools for the Future programme (BSF) aims to rebuild every secondary school in the country within 15 years, so governors need to get to grips with their part in the process. Of course, the educational transformation process is nothing like dealing with builders in your own home - for a start, the decisions are mainly taken by local and central government. However, Edward Lord, chairman of 4ps, local government's project delivery specialist, says: \"For BSF to succeed, school governors and headteachers must be fully engaged in the planning and development of proposals for their schools.\" Many governors have no idea if their existing buildings conform to national standards. A useful guide, Standards for School Premises, can be downloaded from the teachernet website. It is worth noting that for most schools it is the local authority that is legally responsible for the fabric of the building. \"BSF is a baffling subject for anyone new to it,\" says the National Governors' Council, quoted in the foreword of Building Schools for the Future - A Guide For Governors and Headteachers. The guide, produced last year by 4ps, sets out key issues for governors. It suggests that governing bodies should: \u00b7 Make sure that your school is fully engaged in the development of the local authority's Education Vision, particularly at headteacher level \u00b7 Find out how the LEA is consulting, obtain documents and arrange to discuss them at a special governing body meeting \u00b7 Attend meetings arranged by the LEA \u00b7 Ensure that the views of the school are represented in working groups developing project details, or evaluating submissions \u00b7 Ensure that the school is represented in project governance arrangements that will be established later \u00b7 If you govern at an aided school, make sure any religious representative body knows your views \u00b7 Engage with your local councillors so that they know your views. So don't feel like just another brick in the wall - have your say. The guide is available from www.4ps.gov.uk.
