Abandoning his usual restraint on the topic, Hodgson said he would not tolerate anyone in his squad approaching the tournament with the mindset that it was wrong to believe England were talented enough to become the first European nation to win a World Cup in South America. \u201cWhat makes me think we can win it is that it is a knockout competition. If we look at previous tournaments like [Euro] 1992, Denmark didn\u2019t even qualify, they rounded people up from the beaches, and beat Holland on the way to the final and Germany in the final. \u201cWe are not low down the rankings [10th] so anyone who thinks we can\u2019t win has to be barking up the wrong tree. And anyone who comes in with England and thinks we can\u2019t win has to be barking up the wrong tree. \u201cAll I know is that we can work towards it, that the process of winning it is being done as perfectly as possible. With the process we have, and the staff I have, that gives us a really good chance. \u201cI can guarantee you that the players are 100% committed to winning it even though they know it is a big ask. We\u2019d like to think we will go beyond the group stage, we are planning for it.\u2019\u2019 Hodgson was speaking on England\u2019s training camp in Miami."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
