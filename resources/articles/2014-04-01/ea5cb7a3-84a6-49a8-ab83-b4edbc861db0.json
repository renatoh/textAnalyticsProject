There are some tracks by classic Brazilians like Caetano Veloso, played with the utmost sophistication by Viktoria Mullova. Accompaniments from cello, percussion and guitars featuring Matthew Barley, Paul Clarvis and Carioca Freitas are smooth and dusky. Occasionally there's a feeling as with so many crossover classical attempts that the whole thing is too tasteful and careful, but what wins out here is Mullova's sheer dancing virtuosity in Tico tico and Brasileirinho \u2013 these are as dazzling as the sights and sounds of Brazil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
