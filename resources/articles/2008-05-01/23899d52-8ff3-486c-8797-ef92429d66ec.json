At present, though, they enjoy continuous sunlight since, at 357km they are high enough to catch the midnight Sun as they soar over our latitudes. As a result, and until part of the orbit shifts into eclipse on Friday, it is possible to glimpse the ISS whenever it is within range of Britain during the night. Our BST predictions list four sighting opportunities tonight and again tomorrow night, though twilight may interfere with one or two. The asterisk on the prediction for the 24th flags the direction that it emerges from eclipse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
