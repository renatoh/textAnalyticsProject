Followed by a documentary filmmaker, he made his way across Kenbury Street to the gates to the charity\u2019s second site. There he tied a notice to the metal grille. \u201cImportant notice,\u201d it read, all in capitals. \u201cKids Company closed.\u201d So came the quiet end to the saga which has engulfed Kids Company, the charity started 19 years ago by Camila Batmanghelidjh, which supporters say has done more to reach troubled inner-city children than any other. Sharlene Reid, 27, had been standing across the road from the charity\u2019s gates. She was one of a number of shell-shocked local residents who came by to see for themselves what had happened to the charity, which was seen as a crucial community resource. Reid said the street outside had earlier seen protests by parents and children who relied on the charity\u2019s services. Staff, volunteers and service users leaving the premises for the last time had emerged in tears, she said. \u201cYou just drop the bomb like that and expect people to just move on?\u201d she said, following the government\u2019s recent announcement that it would no longer fund Kids Company. \u201cThere\u2019s people\u2019s lives at stake here, as well as the children. What about them? \u201cWe have to make the government hear us. We were protesting. It was not planned. We all came here because they said it was shutting down, to come and collect your things. My friend WhatsApped me this morning and I said, \u2018It\u2019s got that bad?\u2019\u201d A second woman, who declined to give her name but described Kids Company as like family, said: \u201c[The government] have done it at a bad time. It\u2019s [the summer holidays] now, the children are stuck at home with their parents. Some of those parents have got mental health problems. \u201cI believe if Kids Company shuts down there\u2019s going to be more crime. Children are going to go hungry and that\u2019s what worries me. Couple of mums might get flipping sectioned.\u201d Mark Chilvers, 47, a photographer, had mentored children at Kids Company and lived nearby. The area was on the border between two gangs\u2019 turf and the charity had helped to cool hostility between youths, he said. \u201c[The children] found it a safe haven, where they could come to socialise and get all sorts of holistic support,\u201d said Chilvers. \u201cIt was a really valuable environment for some members of the community that struggle the most. What really worries me is, whatever the outcome of the allegations, what\u2019s going to replace it? What\u2019s going to fill the gap, the void left by Kids Company?\u201d Reid had been supported by Kids Company herself when young and lately had volunteered there. She praised Batmanghelidjh, the charity\u2019s charismatic and unconventional founder, who was forced to step down in a last-ditch effort to secure more funding. \u201cCamila has built this up from scratch and she doesn\u2019t take, she just gives,\u201d said Reid. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful woman, all she does is go [to government] and ask for money to give to the vulnerable.\u201d She added: \u201cHow are you going to tell a woman to step down like that? She has dedicated her life to these children. You can\u2019t do this just because you make the laws and you have the upper hand. Their kids can sleep at night in a good bed with good food, and don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d Another demonstration was being planned for Friday, said Reid. Mothers are set to meet at the gates at 10am and march to Downing Street to make their feelings known to the prime minister. Mike Gee, safeguarding manager at Kids Company, was on hand to watch the notices put up. He called the end of the charity a travesty that had left many youngsters and their families with nowhere to turn. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the end of, in our view, what was the best mechanism for supporting some of the most vulnerable children in south London,\u201d said Gee. \u201cThe kids who came to this centre are some of the most vulnerable children I\u2019ve seen in my career and I\u2019ve been a social worker going on 12 years. \u201cThat word vulnerable, people don\u2019t really know what it means. But the reality is I\u2019m talking about 13-year-old girls who tried hanging themselves, 12-year-olds who instead of going home at night sleep under cars. \u201cThe fact that this has come to an end is a disaster. As safeguarding manager, I\u2019d like to issue a plea to my compatriots, my social workers, the directors of social services in Southwark and Lambeth and all social services departments in south London, to say these kids need you. They don\u2019t need assessments or visits once a month, they need people who care about them. \u201cThe government in this country [doesn\u2019t] understand how to work effectively with the most vulnerable children. This is an organisation that has been funded at the cost of \u00a34m a year, frankly that\u2019s nothing. Recently they have invested \u00a330m in planting bushes on a bridge across the river Thames. That money could have safeguarded these children for seven years, so I hold them accountable. \u201cThey sent Camila Batmanghelidjh a letter ... which says never again approach central government for funding. I call that a travesty: if it\u2019s not the job of government to support these children, whose job is it?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
