Fears that the psychological blow from the outrages will push the US into recession grew as official data collected in the week leading up to the hijackings showed the economy failing to respond to earlier cuts in interest rates. The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits rose last week as firms shed workers in an attempt to boost profits following the downturn of the economy in the past year, the labour department said. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index, fell to 83.6 - the lowest level this year - from 91.5 in August, sources said. Economists had forecast the index to read 90.8. The survey was conducted in the period up to September 10, the day before three hijacked planes were flown deliberately into the World Trade Centre towers and the Pentagon, indicating that consumer sentiment was already waning before the tragedy. Initial jobless claims were up 21,000 to 431,000 for the week ending September 8, far in excess of the 404,000 claims that the market had been expecting. The four-week moving average, considered a more reliable barometer of employment conditions because it irons out weekly fluctuations, rose to 411,000 last week from 399,500. The current conditions index, a gauge of how comfortable American consumers feel about economic conditions, dropped to 93.5 in September from 101.2 in August, while the measure of consumers' attitudes about the year ahead, fell sharply to 77.2 in September from 85.2 in August. The number of workers remaining on state unemployment benefits for the week ended September 1, the latest week such data were available, hit 3,345,000, up 152,000 from the previous week. That was the highest level reached since 3,446,000 claims were reported during the week ended August 1 1992, when the nation was struggling to recover from its last recession. Kurt Karl, chief economist at Swiss Re in New York, said: \"It's certainly a time of rising layoffs and falling employment. Unfortunately when the momentum on this thing gets going it just doesn't turn on a dime.\" He predicted that the September payrolls report would be dismal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
