It was as though summer had simply been abandoned. Anyone casually tuning in to the first night of the 2012 BBC Proms may have been confused. Had we all been mysteriously transported forward by two months to the traditional flag-waving beanfeast in September? But it was, of course, still July and it was all a cunning plan. The only flag being waved by the Promenaders was an Olympic one. Ever alert to the occasion, Proms supremo Roger Wright had chosen to bring a British flourish to the start of the Proms season in diamond jubilee and London Olympics year, with a curtain-raising evening of uninterrupted British music. It was no ordinary first night in other ways too. Not just one celebrated British conductor but four: Edward Gardner appeared twice, bookending an evening that also featured Sir Roger Norrington, Sir Mark Elder and Martyn Brabbins on the podium. One wondered how they divided the fees for an evening like this. And five top-notch vocal soloists too, led by Bryn Terfel, no less. The one traditional feature was the BBC Symphony Orchestra, as ever the spinal cord of the Proms, joined by the BBC Symphony Chorus. We started with a world premiere fanfare, Mark-Anthony Turnage's three-minute Canon Fever, scored mainly for brass and percussion, a saucy piece, instantly likeable and utterly appropriate to the occasion. It sounded like a schoolyard chant set to music. In time, perhaps the Turnage fanfare will feel as much of a period piece as much of what followed. Elgar came first, rightly so on such a night, but with a difference this time. Norrington eased the orchestra into a beguilingly discursive performance of the Cockaigne overture, in honour of London itself, of course, but also an instant reminder of what an interesting conductor Norrington is, always with something new to say. Elgar's overture was scaled down from the usual swagger, with Norrington making it sound almost dreamlike. The highlight of the night was Delius's Sea Drift, his transcendental setting of Walt Whitman sung with incisive clarity by Terfel, and shaped in masterly manner by Elder. Delius has been rather short-changed, not for the first time, in this 150th anniversary year of his birth. But the coming Proms season promises generous amends, and if it is all half as good as this performance of the one major piece in the programme that did not sound trapped by history, then honour will have been satisfied. Exquisite playing from the BBC orchestra again, with Daniel Palthorpe's flute taking the honours. Tippett's Suite for the Birthday of Prince Charles, written in 1948, started the second half. What a dated piece it sounds now, a relic of the time when high-minded politically progressive composers thought they could forge a national musical style based on traditional folk tunes lightly spiced with modernism. Brabbins did his best, but it all sounds maddeningly quaint now, the musical equivalent of men in tights declaiming Shakespeare in fruity tones. And so, via an extended and unusually full version of Elgar's often revised Coronation Ode of 1902, a work that is more than a curiosity, with the chorus rising to the occasion, to Land of Hope and Glory. Sarah Connolly tackled this far less relentless version of the great tune with total authority, with Gardner trying and sometimes succeeding in bringing out the score's poignancy. There won't be any of that when we get to September, that's for certain. \u2022 If you're at any Prom this summer, tweet your thoughts about it to @guardianmusic using the hashtag #proms and we'll pull what you've got to say into one of our weekly roundups \u2013 or leave your comments below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
