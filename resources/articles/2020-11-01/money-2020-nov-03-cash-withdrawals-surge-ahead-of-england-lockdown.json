Link, the network that connects virtually all of Britain\u2019s cash machines, said more than \u00a3174m was taken out on Sunday 1 November, the day after Boris Johnson confirmed England would be facing fresh coronavirus restrictions. That was 27% higher than the \u00a3137m withdrawn on an average Sunday since March. Shoppers took out a further \u00a3238m in cash on Monday, making it the busiest day for withdrawals since 16 March when the UK went into lockdown. It is also 26% higher than the \u00a3189m taken out from ATMs on the average Monday since April. It comes as consumers prepare for new Covid rules that will force salons, pubs and non-essential shops to close until at least 2 December from Thursday. Many retailers, hairdressers and restaurants have been extending opening hours since Saturday\u2019s announcement, and seen their strongest bookings in months. Link\u2019s director of strategy, Graham Mott, said: \u201cIt seems likely that people are buying things they will not be able to get in the new lockdown, such as clothes, things for the home or even a haircut. It\u2019s also possible people are planning Christmas early in case lockdown doesn\u2019t end in early December. \u201cOlder and more vulnerable people are typically more reliant on cash, so it may be that some people are withdrawing extra cash so that can be used to pay neighbours or family to get groceries.\u201d At the start of the first lockdown, ATM transactions fell by as much as 60% after some cash machines temporarily closed \u2013 as many were based in shops, garden centres and pubs that were forced to shut. Many shops also switched to contactless-only payments because of potential health risks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
