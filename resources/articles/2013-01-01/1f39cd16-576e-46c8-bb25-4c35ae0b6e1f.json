Torres was replaced by Demba Ba after 81 minutes on Wednesday night and came under fire from a large section of the home fans at Stamford Bridge. However, Chelsea's interim manager claimed the Spaniard's poor performance was due to a stomach bug that he picked up more than a week ago. Ben\u00edtez said that because Ba had sustained a hamstring injury in training, Torres was the right choice to start the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final, and praised him for playing through severe pain. \"We only had Fernando Torres so he was doing a massive effort for the team. He was criticised but was working so hard in difficult circumstances,\" Ben\u00edtez said. \"The other day he was sick on the bench, that was why he didn't play at Southampton. He was there and making an effort just in case. \"It was explained to me as a bug, a virus. He is feeling better, but there are still some problems. The fans loved Torres when he was scoring and giving everything, they will love him again when he starts scoring goals again. They will appreciate the effort.\" Asked about Torres's perceived negative body language, Ben\u00edtez added: \"In England if a player makes a mistake, what do you expect? Bad body language is normal. Fernando Torres is improving in a lot of things. If he is not sick he will be smiling and everybody will be saying the body language is good.\" Following the 2-0 defeat to Swansea, which Chelsea will try to overturn in the second leg at the Liberty Stadium on 23 January, the chair of the club's supporters group described the atmosphere in the stands as \"toxic\". Much of the fans' ire was directed at Torres, who has not justified his \u00a350m transfer fee since arriving from Liverpool in January 2011, having scored 14 goals in 66 Premier League appearances. Ben\u00edtez acknowledged that the significant price tag for the 28-year-old has left Chelsea fans expecting more from the striker, but he is confident that Torres can turn his form around after a miserable spell in west London so far. \"Because the club paid big money, everybody expected a relation between money and goals to be easy,\" Ben\u00edtez said. \"He is a top striker so defenders are more aware of him. He can score again and will have more confidence. \" I would like to see all my players pressured every day. When a professional is not doing as well as expected he will be criticised.\" Chelsea visit Stoke City on Saturday but Torres is expected to be left on the bench, with Ba starting up front. Petr Cech could return from a groin injury, while John Terry will be in the squad for the first time since suffering knee ligament damage against Liverpool in November, after playing 45 minutes in an Under-21 match against Fulham on Thursday, although he will not be in the starting XI. The European champions' form has been better away from home this season, which many believe is a direct result of the hostility directed at Ben\u00edtez and the negative atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge. The speculation surrounding the futures of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, two players who are highly regarded by the Chelsea supporters, has also contributed to the uncertainty. On the reception he continues to receive, Ben\u00edtez said: \"I would prefer them to support the manager and the players. But that's the way it is. If we continue winning it will be easier and the players will be under less pressure. Then it will be fine. \"The majority of the fans support the team and enjoy it when we are doing well. Some are expecting more and we will try to give them more. If they are happy, fine. If not we will try to change them by winning games.\" Ben\u00edtez, who was appointed in November, said speculation that Roman Abramovich will attempt to lure Pep Guardiola to Chelsea in the summer does not faze him and claimed that he should not be judged after such a short time in charge. \"I am under contract and will do my best for the team,\" he said. \"I signed a contract and have to do my best to improve the team. I have been here seven weeks. The players are happy, the staff are doing a great job and doing their best every day. Things are going in the right direction.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
