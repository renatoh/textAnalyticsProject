Anna Burns\u2019 experimental novel Milkman won the inaugural prize for political fiction, while the prize for political writing was awarded to Patrick Radden Keefe for his book Say Nothing. Milkman follows the story of an 18-year-old girl who is harassed by a much older and married paramilitary. It has been described as \u201cexperimental\u201d for its long paragraphs and use of descriptions rather than character names. Tom Sutcliffe, the chair of judges for the prize and BBC Radio 4 presenter, described the book\u2019s tone of voice as \u201ca marvel\u201d. \u201cMilkman is a remarkable book \u2013 recording a specific time and a specific conflict with brilliant precision but universal in its account of how political allegiances crush and deform our instinctive human loyalties,\u201d he said. The Spectator\u2019s literary editor, Sam Leith, the author Preti Taneja and Dr Xine Yao, an American literature lecturer at UCL, were the other judges of the award. Last year, Belfast-born Burns became the first Northern Irish author to win the Man Booker prize for Milkman. The book, her third novel, also picked up the National Book Critics Circle award in 2019. Say Nothing, by the New Yorker magazine staff writer Radden Keefe, forensically details the murder of Jean McConville by the IRA in 1972. McConville, a widowed mother who was abducted from her Belfast home in the presence of her children, was suspected of being an informer by the paramilitary organisation. Tulip Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, who chaired the judges for the award, described Say Nothing as \u201can extraordinary piece of writing\u201d. \u201cIt comes across as an immensely personal tale yet encompasses the historical narrative of the situation in Northern Ireland,\u201d she added. Other judges for the Orwell prize for political writing were Ted Hodgkinson, head of literature and spoken word at Southbank centre, The Times\u2019 literary editor, Robbie Millen, and the author and women\u2019s rights activist Helen Pankhurst. The director of the Orwell Foundation, Prof Jean Seaton, described the Northern Irish peace process \u2013 which brought 30 years of bitter conflict to a close \u2013 as \u201carguably the greatest achievement of UK diplomacy since the second world war\u201d. She added that people \u201cstill need reminding of the horrors this process ended\u201d. The winners of both prizes, which are worth \u00a33,000, were unveiled on Tuesday at University College London \u2013 on the late author George Orwell\u2019s birthday. The Orwell prize for journalism and the Orwell prize for exposing Britain\u2019s social evils, sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, were also handed out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
