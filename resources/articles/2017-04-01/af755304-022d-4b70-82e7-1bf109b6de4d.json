As part of the Twenty\u2019s Plenty campaign instigated by the FSF in 2013, Virgin Media will reimburse the costs of supporters\u2019 tickets above \u00a320 for a single away fixture at all Premier League clubs, with the majority of matches taking place between 15\u201123 April. Last year, clubs voted unanimously to introduce a \u00a330 cap for all away tickets in the Premier League, meaning the telecom company will effectively subsidise \u00a310 on every ticket. \u201cIt\u2019s a refreshing exception to see a sponsor involved with football genuinely doing something that benefits fans,\u201d said Kevin Miles. \u201cMany commercial sponsors pay lip service to the idea of fans being crucial to the game but in supporting the FSF\u2019s work around away fans in particular, this initiative sets a new standard for actually doing something in practice. Fans up and down the country will now be asking what their own club sponsors can do to follow suit.\u201d The scheme applies to matches from 15 April, although the rescheduling of some fixtures owing to the FA Cup semi-finals means fans of West Bromwich Albion, Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton and Sunderland must wait until the new dates are announced to find out when they will benefit. Supporters can claim their subsidy after their team\u2019s match by visiting www.virginmedia.com/twentysplenty, downloading a form, and posting it along with their ticket. A cheque will be sent to them in the following weeks. Manchester City fans will not have to claim their subsidy as their ticket will already be reduced to \u00a320 as part of Virgin Media\u2019s existing Twenty\u2019s Plenty arrangement with Southampton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
