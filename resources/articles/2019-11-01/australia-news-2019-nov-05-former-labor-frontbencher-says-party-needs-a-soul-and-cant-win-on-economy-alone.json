While a number of frontbenchers are highlighting the primacy of campaigning on growth and jobs as the opposition waits for the release of the campaign review by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson on Thursday, Melham says Labor needs to drive the agenda in Indigenous affairs. Melham \u2013 a former shadow Indigenous affairs minister who resigned from the shadow cabinet because of a dispute with Kim Beazley about native title \u2013 has used the Jack Ferguson memorial lecture to identify five issues Labor needs to address, including standing firm on the principle that the voice to parliament be enshrined in the constitution. The Morrison government says it is prepared to countenance a representative body that is legislated \u2013 but not one that is enshrined in the constitution. Melham argued that Labor, which has signalled it will be constructive during the period of co-design even though it wants constitutional enshrinement, needed to hold firm on the position articulated by the Uluru statement. \u201cWithout constitutional recognition, Aboriginal voices will be drowned out by the political considerations of each moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAny legislation recognising their particular rights and status could be repealed at any time by an unfriendly government\u201d. The former shadow minister said Labor also needed to revive a social justice package that was promised but never delivered after the Mabo decision, and undertake to deliver it if it wins the next election. Melham said Labor should champion reparations for the stolen generations, which does not have to be compensation. It could be assistance to recover from the damage inflicted by forced separations. He said Labor needed to revisit the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, because its \u201crecommendations are still valid today\u201d. Then there needed to be effort to encourage successful self-determination. \u201cInstead of taking away funding, and imposing too much red tape, we need to target funding to assist Aboriginal people in their self-determination and create more Aboriginal community leaders.\u201d He said instead of closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, governments were trying to \u201cplug the gap\u201d. \u201cIt concerns me greatly that spending on Indigenous programs has increasingly been directed, not to the preventative or developmental programs, but rather to those programs designed to fix the problem after that problem has occurred,\u201d Melham said. \u201cTo illustrate, there have been increases in funding such as prisons and youth detention, hospital services and unemployment payments in recent years. Surely increased spending would be better directed to community health education or labour market programmes or early childhood education?\u201d He said policies pursued by the Hawke government led to \u201cdramatically improved educational opportunities for Aboriginal and Islander people\u201d with rates of secondary school enrolments rising from 2,000 in 1970 to 20,000 in 1986, and retention rates increasing from 10% in 1982 to 22% in 1988. He said Bob Hawke and Paul Keating left a substantial legacy because both took the lead within the party, \u201cand at times this was in opposition to the fears of the caucus\u201d. He said if Labor abandoned this tradition of leadership \u201cwe are all diminished \u2013 as individuals and as a party\u201d. \u201cThis is core business for Labor: we need a soul, we can\u2019t win on the economy alone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
