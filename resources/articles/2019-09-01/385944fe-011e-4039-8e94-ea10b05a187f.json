The 20-year-old midfielder savoured the fulfilment of a dream that went back to his arrival at the club\u2019s academy at the age of six and, yes, he says it was a beautiful moment for him and his family. But the way he puts it, it was merely a staging post on his football journey, something to be taken in his easy stride. \u201cI don\u2019t really look at that pressure, I don\u2019t really look at any other thing but focusing on how I perform, what I can do in the game,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family have always said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the pressure side.\u2019 I\u2019ve always stuck to that.\u201d Things are happening very quickly for him. After a successful loan at Derby last season under Frank Lampard, he has been given a gilded opportunity at Chelsea by the manager, who made an emotional return to Stamford Bridge over the summer. It was emotional, too, for Mount, who used to count Lampard, then a Chelsea midfielder, among his boyhood idols. Mount has started all four of the team\u2019s league fixtures, either in the No 10 role or off the left and, after the disappointment of the 4-0 defeat at Old Trafford, he has caught the eye, scoring against Leicester and Norwich and, by common consent, establishing himself as the breakout English star of the season. That is certainly the view of Gareth Southgate, who has recalled Mount to his England squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria on Saturday and Kosovo next Tuesday. The manager first selected Mount for last October\u2019s matches against Croatia and Spain, though he did not get on the pitch. \u201cLeading up to the United game at Old Trafford we did shape work and you kind of get the feeling you might be in the team,\u201d Mount says. \u201cBut the experience of playing there with Derby last season [in the Carabao Cup] and winning [on penalties] gave me a feeling of: \u2018I have played here before. I know what it feels like.\u2019\u201d Mount had an excellent game for Derby that night and it was a measure of his confidence and composure that he stepped forward to convert the opening kick of the shootout. For him it is all about embracing opportunity, rather than shying from it. At the European Under-19 championship in 2017 he was the player of the tournament as England emerged victorious and he took on the challenge of a loan to Vitesse Arnhem in 2017-18, finishing with 14 goals, 10 assists and the club\u2019s player of the season award. \u201cThat was kind of the first step in my career, to go to Holland,\u201d Mount says. \u201cIt was tough at the start and for the first couple of months I wasn\u2019t playing but it was the best step. I learned so much and my mentality got so much stronger living away from my family. It was very, very tough but I would always say to any young player: \u2018Go to Germany or wherever,\u2019 because you gain so much experience from those international leagues.\u201d Mount was mindful that he would not get many opportunities at Chelsea under Maurizio Sarri last season and so he went to Derby where he would play. He scored 11 goals in 44 appearances and a combination of factors at Stamford Bridge, including Lampard\u2019s appointment and a transfer ban, have helped to open the door for him. Chelsea turned a profit of \u00a383.5m on transfers over the summer \u2013 mainly through the sale of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid \u2013 and the expectation is that they will spend heavily next summer; all of which has made this season feel like a golden window for the club\u2019s youngsters. Can they convince the hierarchy that they, rather than expensive imports, represent the long-term future? \u201cI think it [the transfer ban] maybe played a part but you\u2019ve got to work hard to earn your starting place,\u201d Mount says. \u201cAll the boys have done that. The Premier League is definitely a big step up but you\u2019ve got to be ready.\u201d There has been the temptation to compare Mount to Lampard, even if the latter was a different kind of midfielder. Lampard was a pure No 8, a box-to-box player of tremendous power and stamina, who loved to time those late breaks into the area. Mount plays further up the pitch and, at the moment, is a more waspish presence. Yet there are similarities, and not just in terms of their eye for a goal. For example, Mount, like Lampard, is driven by a ferocious work ethic. \u201cAfter training he [Lampard] does one-on-one finishing work with me,\u201d Mount says. \u201cI talk to him every day, especially after games, on what I can do better and where I can make runs to get into the box. There is no better person to learn from than him.\u201d As a Portsmouth boy and Pompey fan, Mount can smile at the prospect of featuring for England at St Mary\u2019s stadium in Southampton, the venue for the Kosovo game. But what shines through is his determination to make a mark, be it at Wembley against Bulgaria or on the south coast. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave disappointed at all after the Croatia and Spain games last season,\u201d Mount says. \u201cIt just gave me more fire to want to get into a future squad and play. That was my mindset. Having a taste of being around the place and the first team gave me that extra hunger.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
