You should be so lucky. Beg pardon? First you want ice. Then lemons. Where will the madness end? I'm sorry? Maraschino cherries - would that satisfy you? Miniature umbrellas? Angostura flaming bitters? All I wanted was a slice of lemon for my wife's gin and orange ... Well we've had it up to here with you nouveau Lemon Slicers! But lemon slices have been around forever! Everywhere has lemon slices! I suspect you've been spending too much time fraternising with the metropolitan elite, sonny. I have? Not everywhere has lemon slices. They don't have lemon slices at the Empire Club working men's club in Rhymney Valley, South Wales. They don't? Oh no. Some ponce waltzed in there recently, all airs and graces, and asked for a slice of lemon in his wife's beverage. D'you know what they told him? No. \"It's not a cocktail bar you know.\" A slice of lemon doesn't constitute a cocktail! Maybe not to you, with your martinis and your sea breezes, but to some people ice 'n' slice is but one step away from a fluffy duck. Well what do they drink at the Empire Club? Pints. Well I think you're being rather hard on the poor humble lemon. Listen, lemons is where the rot starts. You mark my words: one day it's lemons, the next it's caipirinhas. So henceforth it's ice or nothing. But lemons have been popular here since the Middle Ages! Granted. But ice has been around since the Ice Age, hasn't it? Well I hope you all get scurvy. \"Lemons are not called for in the Valleys\" - that's what the club steward said, and henceforth that is my mantra. Isn't there any hope for the lemonless G&amp;T drinks of the Valleys? \"If there is a demand we will serve lemon with some drinks,\" the club's chairman has since revealed. Next week: Lime wedges in the Rhondda - is this progress?"}, "isHosted": false}}}
