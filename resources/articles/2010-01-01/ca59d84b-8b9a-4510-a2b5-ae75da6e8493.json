The Brazilian striker, on loan at Everton from Eastlands, had returned to South America without permission last month and found himself the subject of a severe club sanction on his return to Merseyside. Although J\u00f4 has been nursing a knee injury, he did not tell Everton officials about his unscheduled trip to Brazil to attend to a \"personal matter\" shortly before Christmas and Moyes \u2013 who will almost certainly seek to cut short his loan deal and return the \u00a318m striker to City \u2013 was suitably unimpressed. \"J\u00f4 went to Brazil without permission from the club,\" said Moyes, who yesterday hinted that the striker might well have played his last game for Everton. \"He is now back in Liverpool but is suspended at the present time. \"I'm disappointed. We like J\u00f4, he's a really good lad and we enjoy having him here but there has to be discipline at football clubs. He left during a busy period when we were short of players. I find that very difficult so he is suspended and the disciplinary process is on-going.\" The breach of club rules should make it simple to cut short what was intended to be a season-long loan deal. A prolific striker for CSKA Moscow \u2013 where he scored 44 times in 77 games \u2013 J\u00f4 struggled to adapt to life at City under the club's former manager Mark Hughes last season. Despite scoring five goals in 12 games while on loan at Everton for a short spell last winter, he has made less of an impact at Goodison Park this term, managing just two goals. It is now possible that the Eastlands board may seek to cut their losses on what the club tacitly agrees to have been an \u00a318m mistake. Indeed J\u00f4 could shortly return to Russia where CSKA are reported to be extremely keen on taking their former star striker back on loan until the end of the season with a view to completing a permanent, if cut-price, deal in the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
