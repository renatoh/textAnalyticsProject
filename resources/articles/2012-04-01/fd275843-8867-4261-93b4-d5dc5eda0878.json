Talk about rubbing salt into wounds, the reigning Premiership champions dashed to Newcastle Airport where a private jet was waiting to whisk them off to Catalonia while their opponents were preparing for the worst because the former champions could be goners if Wasps manage to pick up a couple of points at Bath on Saturday. The reaction of the Falcons interim director of rugby, Gary Gold, to a result that saw the spectre of relegation rise said it all. \"I'm devastated with the end result. We put in a massive performance from a character point of view but there were a couple of functional things that didn't work as well as we had planned \u2013 the lineout in the first half \u2013 and their points came from our scrum. \"There is a reason why Saracens are Premiership champions and there is a reason why they can travel and get results. They put us to the test and towards the end we put them to the test, so I'm very proud of the players' courage. I thought we were going to get over in the end and bizarrely I was quite calm.\" While the Saracens camp prepare for a night of entertainment at Camp Nou, Gold will head to watch Newcastle United play Stoke with the Falcons owner, Semore Kurdi, clearly wishing the season was not nearing its end. \"I just wish it was not the end of the season,\" he said. \"I wish this was how we were playing at the beginning. I could see how up for it the guys were and, if you have got that attitude and you can keep Sarries scoreless from a try point of view, then we are on our way to good things.\" Should Wasps fail to make the most of Newcastle's near-miss, then Gold, who will be replaced by Dean Richards for next season, should be bullish about his team's prospects of beating Wasps at Adams Park in a fortnight because they gave Saracens a good run for their money. They may not have had the attacking guile or the pace needed to break down the Saracens defence despite the efforts of the former Sarries scrum-half Peter Stringer but they made up for their shortcomings with resolute defensive work to set up a rousing finale as they went for victory. Three penalties kicked by Owen Farrell \u2013 who played at centre due to a calf injury sustained by Brad Barritt in the warm-up \u2013 proved enough for Saracens to move into second place above Leicester. Jimmy Gopperth responded with a penalty of his own. When Justin Melck was sin-binned for a third late challenge in the 66th minute, Newcastle's hopes of a shock win were raised but they failed to capitalise as Saracens stood firm and the try-line remained agonisingly beyond Gold's side. With a play-off semi-final berth now assured, Saracens' coach, Paul Gustard,, who will be running in Sunday's London Marathon, is relishing facing the Leicester Tigers at home or away. \"We defended brilliantly in the last 10 minutes and that was reminiscent of the way we played against Leicester in the final last season,\" said Gustard. \"If we have to go to Leicester for our semi-final we have to go to Leicester. The last three years we have won there on the road and we are probably one of the only teams in the league who can say that.\" Newcastle Goosen; Uys, Helleur, Fitzpatrick, Shortland; Gopperth, Stringer; Golding, Vickers (Thompson, 60), Murray (Hall 74), Hudson, Swinson, Hogg, Welch (Wilson, 64), Balding (Tu'ifua, 55).
