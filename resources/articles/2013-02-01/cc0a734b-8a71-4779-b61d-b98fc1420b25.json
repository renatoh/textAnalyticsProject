Replace the transfer window with Odemwingie Day", "bodyText": "Footballer Peter Odemwingie will never be allowed to forget Thursday. Anxious to move from West Bromwich Albion to Queens Park Rangers on the last day of the transfer window, the player said farewell to his Midlands teammates, drove to west London, and attempted to seal a deal with QPR. Embarrassingly for Odemwingie, QPR would not let him through the door, as the clubs had been unable to agree terms. So it was back up the M1 for Odemwingie for a tricky reunion with the club \u2013 and the supporters \u2013 he tried to leave. It was a farcical episode. But it could be a better model for future transfer dealings than the window period. So, in future, on a day to be known as Odemwingie Day, all players who wish to move clubs should get in their Audi R8s and their Bentleys and drive to the club they wish to join. At noon, club chairs and managers will open their doors and see who is on offer. In the time-honoured playground manner, they will make their picks and let the rest go. Everything will be transparent. Agents will be marginalised. Transfers will be based on facts, not rumours. And if it is made a public holiday, fans can come along to eat, drink and give the hopeful the thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Market forces would ensure that players would show up only at clubs where they had a realistic chance of being taken on. They wouldn't all head straight to Chelsea or Man City. In older times, it was called a hiring fair. Odemwingie Day would be a fine way of adapting this old tradition to modern needs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
