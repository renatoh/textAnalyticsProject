Larry Fine's book not only demystifies how the instrument works, but also looks critically at the buying process. Piano Time (Oxford Piano Method) by Pauline Hall Oxford University Press Piano Time now runs to several volumes of instruction and pieces to play. Colourful and well presented, the series offers a range of music for young players. The Classic Piano Course by Carol Barratt Music Sales Corporation Carol Barratt's three-volume Classic Piano Course keeps an adult tone throughout, avoiding the garish colours of volumes for kids. Also comes with its own fold-out dummy keyboard. The Art of Piano Playing by Heinrich Neuhaus Kahn &amp; Averill Heinrich Neuhaus was a Russian concert pianist and teacher who taught (among others) Sviatoslav Richter, Radu Lupu and Emil Gilels. He presented some of his ideas in this much-admired slim volume. \"I never fail to feel that I am in the presence of a miracle as I explain to my pupils the works of genius of the great musicians,\" he writes, \"and we strive together to the best of our abilities to fathom their depth, probe their mysteries, understand their structure and raise ourselves to their lofty heights.\" How to Read Music by Helen Cooper Omnibus Press The basics of reading music, presented in bite-size portions by musician and teacher Helen Cooper. A related CD can be purchased separately. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music OUP Oxford Music has its own jargon that mystifies the uninitiated. This dictionary will help you to decode what your sheet music - and your teacher - is on about. Piano Notes: The Hidden World of the Pianist by Charles Rosen Penguin Performer, teacher and musicologist Charles Rosen may be the modern-day counterpart to Neuhaus. In this book, he touches on \"the instrument and its discontents\" (\"A pianist should cultivate a certain humility before a really fine technician\"), memorising (\"It is much harder to forget music than to remember it\"), and the conventions of performance (\"The ideal virtuoso piece is one that sounds harder than it really is\"). Guide to the Piano Repertoire by Maurice Hinson Indiana University Press This guide grades the repertoire in terms of easy, intermediate, medium-difficult and difficult, along with comments about technical requirements. The Musician's Body by Jaume Rosset I Llobet and George Odam Ashgate The cartoonish style of this book belies a serious intent: to make musicians aware of how they use their bodies. The Great Pianists by Harold C Schonberg The book provides an invaluable overview of the instrument's great players and the art of \"finger dancing\", as Beethoven called it. Like its author, a music critic for the New York Times, the book is passionate and prejudiced, but never dull."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
