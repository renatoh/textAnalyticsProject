As Boris Johnson broke cover to launch his Conservative party leadership campaign, in which he repeated his pledge to leave the EU by 31 October, industry representatives were telling MPs that crashing out of the bloc was \u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist with Make UK, which represents some of the country\u2019s largest manufacturers, said: \u201cThere is a direct link between politicians talking up the prospect of no deal and British firms losing customers overseas and British people losing jobs. \u201cA no-deal Brexit would be nothing short of commercial suicide.\u201d He told the House of Commons Brexit select committee that some businesses were already \u201cdownsizing or completely shutting down in the UK\u201d. Some were very profitable and leaders in their sector, but were struggling because of the political uncertainty. Nevin said he was aware of one company, which he could not name because of a confidentiality agreement, that was planning to quit Britain. \u201cThat will result in several thousand job losses,\u201d he said adding that a no-deal Brexit \u201cwould be nothing short of an act of economic vandalism\u201d and \u201cundo 25 years of economic progress and consign a generation of highly skilled workers to the scrapheap\u201d. His assessment came in stark contrast to Johnson\u2019s upbeat declaration that he would deliver Brexit and transform the UK into a powerhouse that would \u201cgo neck and neck with Germany\u201d in manufacturing and technology. Johnson declared he would \u201cstick up for every business in this country\u201d. In a mixed message, however, he also declared he was not aiming for no deal while being prepared to leave the EU without a deal. \u201cI think if we block it, we will face mortal retribution from the electorate,\u201d he said. Businesses told MPs that a Halloween Brexit would be a disaster. Tim Rycroft, the chief operating officer with the Food and Drink Federation, said shortages of food would begin to appear within two weeks of a no-deal Brexit. Fresh fruit and vegetables would be held up on the Calais-Dover journey because of mandatory food health checks, but so too would processed chicken originating in the UK, he said. \u201cWe produce a lot of chicken but they are sent to [the] EU for processing and then re-imported.\u201d Rycroft said bread and confectionery were other foodstuffs that would be affected, as the UK did not produce enough dried milk or high-protein wheat. He said: \u201cWe will see selective shortages and probably unpredictably and that might go on for several weeks and potentially months after a no-deal exit.\u201d Nevin also challenged claims that the port of Calais would be able to deliver a frictionless Brexit in the event of a crash-out. He told MPs the port had done a trial of sanitary and phytosanitary tests that would be mandatory on the EU side and this had led to long delays. The Democratic Unionist party MP for east Antrim, Sammy Wilson, put it to him that the port of Calais had said it would be ready for no deal. Wilson asked Nevin: \u201cSo the assurances given by the mayor of Calais are not true?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Nevin replied."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
