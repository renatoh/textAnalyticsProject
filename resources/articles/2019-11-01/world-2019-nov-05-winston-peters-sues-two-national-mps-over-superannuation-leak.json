Peters, who is currently acting PM in Jacinda Ardern\u2019s absence, alleges that Anne Tolley and Paula Bennett breached his privacy by leaking his superannuation documents to the media. Peters, who was the case\u2019s first witness in the high court on Monday, is also suing the attorney general, David Parker, on behalf of the ministry of social development, the ministry boss Brendan Boyle and the state services commissioner Peter Hughes, saying their ministries should not have provided information to the National MPs of his superannuation over-payments. Peters says his reputation was tarnished a month out from the 2017 general election. \u201cIt is still brought up by my detractors as a slur on my character to this very day,\u201d RNZ reported him saying in court. \u201cThere was no scandal, just a malicious leak which mixes fact with a deliberate falsehood.\u201d \u201cI find it repugnant and I believe any New Zealander would equally find it repugnant if their private dealings with MSD [ministry of social development] were released to ministers who have no responsibility in the issue. In my case ministers who are my political opponents, a month out from a general election.\u201d Peters is seeking damages of NZ$450,000 from each defendant named in court documents, for a total of nearly NZ$2m. New Zealand taxpayers will foot the bill for any damages awarded, and taxpayers are also paying for the Crown\u2019s defence that it was not wrong to share Peters\u2019 details with the National MPs. The Crown argues Peters was treated the same as any other private citizen and ministers at the time had a \u201cno surprises policy\u201d, meaning they asked ministry officials to inform them of any cases that could be high-profile or draw attention. The trial is set to last three weeks. Peters has said he isn\u2019t to blame for the superannuation over-payments \u2013 which lasted seven years \u2013 and the fault lay with the ministry which incorrectly processed a form, and paid him the higher rate of a single person, rather than the lower-rate of a partnered person. Peters said that in the same month of his 2010 superannuation application, 23 other people in New Zealand made the same mistake on their form, failing to tick the box asking whether they had a partner. Peters paid back NZ$18,000 to the ministry of social development, after he was alerted to the over-payments. The former social affairs minister, Anne Tolley, and current National party deputy leader, Paula Bennett, are expected to give evidence in court this week, as well as a number of journalists and some witnesses who have had their identities protected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
