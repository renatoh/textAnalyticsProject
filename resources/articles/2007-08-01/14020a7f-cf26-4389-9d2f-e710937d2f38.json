Kingston hospital in south-west London said it was evaluating the proposal, which would see control of its operating theatres taken over under a 10-year contract. A spokeswoman for the hospital said: \"We are currently in the process of evaluating working with an independent sector provider to secure elective work and to improve the overall position of Kingston hospital. \"If the evaluation shows real benefits for patients and the hospital, then a final decision will be made by early 2008. All staff working with the new provider will remain NHS employees, and will retain NHS terms and conditions of employment.\" Yesterday the pressure group London Health Emergency urged the government to intervene in what it described as an \"unprecedented experiment\" in privatisation. The move has also led to disquiet among staff and their representatives who have described it as a \"significant step\". Some staff were unsure how a private company would make a profit. Geoff Martin, head of campaigns at London Health Emergency, called for health secretary Alan Johnson to intervene. Mr Johnson visited Kingston hospital with Gordon Brown at the end of June. Mr Martin said: \"This is NHS privatisation on a scale we have never seen before. It would appear that the trust board have cooked up this plan themselves, and it will be a huge embarrassment for the government at a time when they are signalling that the pace of private companies' involvement in the NHS is being pulled back.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
