David Higgins, the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, earns between \u00a3390,000 and \u00a3394,999 a year. He is one of 15 people working on the games who are paid more than David Cameron's \u00a3142,500. Figures published today show that 26 quangocrats earn more than \u00a3200,000 and 158 earn more than \u00a3150,000. The publication, part of a drive for more transparency in government, will intensify pressure on quangos as many are threatened with closure as part of the public sector spending reductions. Twenty-four individuals refused to have their salaries published. The coalition has named 172 civil servants as earning more than Cameron. On the quango rich list are several whose tenures have been controversial. Trevor Phillips, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, whose organisation has been hit by resignations and who has personally been investigated by MPs in the Commons, is paid between \u00a3110,000 and \u00a3115,000 a year but works only three and a half days a week. Ralph Seymour Jackson is listed as chief executive of the Student Loans Company, despite having been deposed by the universities minister, David Willetts, for his part in failing to tackle the spectacular failure to deliver loans on time last year. He earned between \u00a3165,000 and \u00a3169,999 for his efforts. The figures highlight the existence of some obscure public bodies, including the Horserace Betting Levy Board, whose chief executive, Douglas Erskine-Crum, earns between \u00a3220,000 and \u00a3224,999. Its chairman, Paul Lee, earns \u00a360,000-\u00a364,999 for five days' work a month. He is not paid for attending race meetings. At British Waterways, the chief executive, Robin Evans \u2013 whose salary is \u00a3230,000-\u00a3234,999 \u2013 is among five staff members earning more than \u00a3150,000. Seven members of staff at the Audit Commission, the local government spending watchdog, earn more than \u00a3150,000, with three of its managing directors \u2013 Eugene Sullivan (currently acting chief executive), Andy Mckeon and Peter Wilkinson in the 180,000-\u00a3184,999 bracket. An eighth person, the chairman, Michael O'Higgins, is listed at \u00a390,000 for his post, which is two days a week. The commission has already been stripped of key responsibilities and could face the axe in the coalition's cull of quangos. A substantial chunk of the Olympic budget goes on the top 15 employees. Howard Shiplee, the director of construction, receives between \u00a3285,000 and \u00a3289,999. Godric Smith, its head of communications and Tony Blair's official spokesman when he was prime minister, gets nearly \u00a3200,000. In 2008, Higgins also received a \u00a3205,000 bonus. Privately it has been argued that, unlike some other areas of the public sector, the Olympics has to compete internationally to recruit on the open market, forcing prices up. There is also some compensation for the fact that the job will automatically come to an end after 2012. For the first time, the figures include details of staff in the security services. Sir John Sawers, chief of MI6, is revealed to earn between \u00a3165,000 and \u00a3169,999. Jonathan Evans, director general of MI5, gets \u00a3155,000-\u00a3159,999. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's high earners include Tony Fountain, the chief executive, who earns between \u00a3365,000 and \u00a3369,999, excluding a \u00a370,810 allowance in lieu of pension and \u00a391,000 assistance with relocation costs, which will reduce to zero over three years. Among key figures in government-funded arts bodies are Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate galleries, whose salary is \u00a3160,000-\u00a3164,999. John Woodward, chief executive officer of the UK Film Council, gets between \u00a3170,000 and \u00a3174,999, and Dame Lynne Brindley, director of the British Library, earns \u00a3155,000-\u00a3159,999. Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, said: \"Yet again we have shown we are absolutely committed to acting quickly on pledges in our coalition agreement to release information that will allow everyone to hold their politicians and public bodies to account. \"Today's release, along with previous publications listing high-earning civil servants and salaries of special advisers, shows that transparency is fast becoming an integral part of everything we do. I believe this will not only increase accountability, but will lead to more efficient public service organisations.\" The government also intends to publish all civil service salaries above \u00a358,200. The coalition is conducting a review of all quangos and will test each one according to whether the job it does needs a particular technical skill the government doesn't have in-house, or needs to be independent of ministers. Regional development agencies became the latest victim of the quango cull this week; deputy prime minister Nick Clegg announced their replacement with \"local enterprise partnerships\", made up of councillors and businesses. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 July 2010. The original wrongly named Robin Evans as chief executive of the Audit Commission with a salary band of \u00a3230,000-\u00a3234,999. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
