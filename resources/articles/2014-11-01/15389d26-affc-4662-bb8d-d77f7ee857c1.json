But this is arguably the best one: a tough, tense, and entirely absorbing thriller based on a short story of Lehane\u2019s entitled Animal Rescue, from the 2009 anthology he edited, Boston Noir. It is a gripping drama, showing how crime is partly a planned and intelligible activity, in which gangsters ruthlessly prosecute clearly defined interests, but also partly random, irrational and almost arbitrary. Tom Hardy plays Bob, an apparently nice enough guy who works in a bar owned by his glowering and resentful cousin Marv, played by the late James Gandolfini, a semi-retired wiseguy now in hock to the scary Chechens, who use his bar as a discreet place to \u201cdrop\u201d packages of mob cash to be collected later. When Bob rescues a pit-bull puppy from a trash can outside an apartment belonging to part-time waitress Nadia (Noomi Rapace), this blameless act sets in train actions which will end, of course, in violence. It is not an obvious wrong-place-wrong-time happenstance, more a butterfly-wingbeat moment that mysteriously changes Bob\u2019s whole life. But it is also a case of bringing about something that was waiting to happen anyway: an inescapable destiny. This is a movie riddled with guilt and fear. Bob is menaced by a cop, Detective Torres (John Ortiz), who recognises him from the local Catholic church they both attend. Torres upbraids Bob for not taking communion. Is it a cop ploy? Or the genuine indignation of a co-religionist? The title implies a hellish descent. \u2022 The Drop\u2019s Matthias Schoenaerts: a new portrayal of masculinity This article was amended on Friday 14 November 2014. We said The Town was based on a book by Dennis Lehane. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s adapted from Chuck Hogan\u2019s novel Prince of Thieves. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
