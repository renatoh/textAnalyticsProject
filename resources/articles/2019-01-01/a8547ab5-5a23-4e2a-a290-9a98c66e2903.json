City enter the game with their confidence lifted by Sunday\u2019s 3-1 win at Southampton, which was timely after they suffered three defeats in the previous four Premier League matches. They sit seven points behind the leaders, Liverpool, before what is the classic so-called six-pointer. Win and City\u2019s title defence would be back in business; lose and it could be over. Under Pep Guardiola City have a poor record against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, winning only one of seven meetings \u2013 the 5-0 Premier League home victory in September 2017, which was coloured by the Liverpool forward Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s 37th-minute red card. They lost 4-3 in the Anfield return last season and they were beaten home and away in the Champions League quarter-final. City\u2019s approach on Thursday will be fascinating. In the league fixture at Anfield earlier in the season, which finished 0-0 after Riyad Mahrez missed a late penalty, they were more conservative than normal, slowing the tempo and exerting control in possession. Guardiola had been extremely wary of Liverpool\u2019s quick transitions. It was a more typical City performance at Southampton, one in which they pressed hard and risked the ball, particularly at the back when playing out through the goalkeeper, Ederson. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, the Southampton manager, noted how City took \u201ca lot of risk to build up their game\u201d and he felt that, if his players could \u201cfind the right moment to attack and win the ball early\u201d, they could score, which is what they did when Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg equalised. City know it will be essential against Liverpool to find the right balance. \u201cWe know the pressure is a little bit more on us because, if we don\u2019t win, it will be very difficult to go after them,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we will try to do; it\u2019s what we try to do in every game. We\u2019ll try to play the same way that we\u2019ve been doing always \u2013 keep pressing high and having control of the ball. \u201cIt was good to come back against Southampton after the difficult moment of losing three out of four games in the Premier League. The team had a very solid performance and everyone\u2019s happy. I think it was really good to get a win before the game against Liverpool and get our confidence back to where it should be.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s attacking trio of Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah invariably draws the attention but the first thing Silva mentioned when asked about City\u2019s title rivals was their defence. Liverpool have conceded only eight goals in 20 league games and no opponent has scored more than once against them. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a lot of clean sheets,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s an impressive defence. Everyone knows how good their front three are \u2013 they work a lot and so do the midfielders. It\u2019s a very good team. We beat them at home last season but we lost there in the Premier League and there was the Champions League, too. In the first leg they were better than us but in the second we were better than them but, because of a lot of things we don\u2019t control, we lost that game.\u201d Silva acknowledged it was preferable to lead from the front in a title race rather than attempt to play catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be that team than what we are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to think that we have to win every game possible. If we win on Thursday, the gap will only be four points \u2013 seven or four is very different \u2013 but we\u2019ll put some pressure into them. They\u2019re unbeaten until now in the league. We\u2019ll try to end that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
