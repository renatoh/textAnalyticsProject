It appears shortly after the unveiling at the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire, of the haunting statue of a teenage soldier shot for desertion in 1915: almost the equivalent of going over the top into hostile fire. The government's decision in 1998 to acknowledge the executed soldiers of the first world war as victims, but to stop short of pardon, has not settled this contentious issue, and the campaign for pardon continues. That the authors of this book aim to take a cool, balanced look at the subject - above all, to see it in its historical context - will not necessarily endear it to those for whom this has become a lifelong cause. There is a tiny village in deep country near Arras called Bailleulmont. In low ground nearby is the municipal cemetery, with a handful of British war graves attached. The headstone of one of them, that of Private A Ingham of the Manchester Regiment, bears the unique inscription \"Shot at Dawn / One of the First to Enlist / A Worthy Son of his Father\". Private Ingham and the soldier buried next to him, Private Longshaw, were executed for desertion, probably in this dour little valley, on 1 December 1916. Geoff Dyer wrote movingly of Ingham's fate in his book The Missing of the Somme. He praised the father who, learning the truth about his son's death, chose to celebrate it rather than conceal it. Dyer also saw courage in Ingham's opting out from a brutal war, claiming: \"The deserter's grave has become a hero's grave.\" Corns and Hughes-Wilson tell us the story behind this double execution. Ingham and Longshaw were discovered on a Swedish ship at Dieppe, having discarded their uniforms and claiming to be American citizens. No army on active service and under appalling pressure - the men were arrested during the Battle of the Somme, in which they had themselves taken part - could overlook such behaviour, especially at a time when many saw prison or penal servitude as an appealing alternative to the hazards of the field. An often ignored element in this equation is the attitude to deserters of their comrades-in-arms. The authors quote tellingly from Frederic Manning's classic novel of the Somme, The Middle Parts of Fortune: \"When Miller disappeared just before the Hun attack, many of the men... were bitter and summary in their judgment... They were to go through it while he saved his skin... [I]f one were to ask any man who had been through that spell of fighting what ought to have been done in the case of Miller, there would have been only one answer. Shoot the bugger!\" A basic argument of the book is that, far more than has been acknowledged, there was a genuine attempt in the case of most courts martial to observe required legal processes. That judgment was often swift and harsh reflects the fact that military law, by common understanding, was especially stringent during active service. Yet the figures do not bear out the popular notion that effectively the military establishment saw the firing squad as a convenient means of culling anybody who stepped out of line. Statistics for desertion show that as many as 38,000 men were brought to trial, of whom just over 2,000 were sentenced to death, yet almost 90% of these were reprieved. Those executed totalled 266. That figure inevitably includes cases where few would argue fiercely for a pardon. One deserter was shot in 1915 after being shopped by a French madame who had given him home and comfort, when he left her for the solace of another madame in the same street. In this instance, execution was clearly a crime passionnel by proxy. Yet undoubtedly, many who died in these dismal dawn rituals were men who were disoriented, confused or out of their depth, or whose stamina and commitment had been eroded by circumstances they could never have imagined when they enlisted. I admit one regret in reading this book: I grieve at finding A P Herbert's 1919 novel The Secret Battle - arguably the first public adumbration of this subject - dismissed as a \"fictional pastiche cameo\". Herbert is generally assumed to have based his plot on the case of a feeble fellow officer of the Royal Naval Division, Edwin Dyett, executed in January 1917; but his invented hero, Harry Penrose, is a far more admirable figure who ultimately fails through sheer psychological exhaustion. Herbert thus focused on some of the most unfortunate victims of the execution process: those who had striven hard and long only to find their bank balance of courage so paid out that they lost all motivation. Significantly, one of The Secret Battle 's greatest admirers was Winston Churchill, who called it \"a soldier's tale cut in stone to melt all hearts\". It is therefore fascinating to find that Churchill intervened at a crucial phase in this story. Rightly, the authors take their subject through to the abolition of the death penalty for desertion and similar crimes in 1929, and on to the second world war, when certain powerful lobbyists begged for its return. By March 1940 the British commander in France, Lord Gort, was arguing that penal servitude was an insufficient deterrent against desertion, while in 1942 the Commander in Chief Middle East, Sir Claude Auchinleck, was pleading \"in strongest possible terms for earliest possible agreement to reintroduce death penalty for specified offences\". In this case too, desertion headed the sin-list. In the end it was seen that, whatever the arguments from the field, the political dimension made reintroduction impossible. Legislation would be unavoidable and the mere fact of it would be counter-productive. \"If the situation was really as bad as claimed, advertising the army's problems would only make it worse and give Britain's enemies - and even its allies - a deeply damaging propaganda coup. Churchill said 'no' and there the matter rested.\" Somehow one can't help feeling that Churchill's outright negative was more than a political gesture; it was recognition that this was a practice due for the historical dustbin. Overall I welcome and applaud this excellently researched and compulsively readable book. I entirely endorse its argument that we should be wary of applying modern civilian peacetime values to a time when the death penalty was almost universal, psychiatry scarcely existed and the resilience and reliability of her forces in the field was seen as crucial to Britain's national survival. I accept the claim that this book \"brings a real understanding to the reader of how and why these sad and bitter executions took place\". Yet I still harbour certain anxieties about this most disturbing of issues. The Australians refused to impose the death penalty, and fought magnificently. The Indian army preferred the old penalty of flogging, which allowed a guilty man the chance to redeem himself and fight on. The Germans executed just 18 soldiers in the first world war, fought superbly, and yet lost. They executed hundreds under Hitler's brutal regime in the second world war, and still lost. I sense this subject will remain on the agenda for some time yet. \u0095 Malcolm Brown is a freelance historian at the Imperial War Museum; his revised Imperial War Museum Book of the Western Front will be published by Pan in November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
