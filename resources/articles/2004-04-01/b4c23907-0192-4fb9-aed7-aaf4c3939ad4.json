No, I don't want that. But since our performances are the result of long thought and our own effort of understanding, I wouldn't at all mind sending the audience home in thoughtful mood. Happily thoughtful, or nostalgic or inward-looking - but \"entertained\" seems to miss the point. Yet over the centuries, and back in the good days when there was no split between popular and \"art\" music, musicians have been entertainers more often than not. Employed at court or by wealthy patrons to provide soothing background music, musicians of earlier centuries would have been used to being ignored or only half-heard. Silence was not expected from the audience. Only the fortunate few would get to entertain their masters in private where, as we learn from Shakespeare, a well-chosen song could be the catalyst for someone's new train of thought. But often musicians, even when public concerts and opera performances became popular, had to accept that the audience would chat, move about, drink and play cards. Mozart was pleased one night in the 1780s when the Emperor, \"against his usual habit\", stayed for the whole of the concert. A century later, when Clara Schumann visited London to give a chamber music concert, a critic commented that the playing was so majestic that \"the majority of the audience stayed until the end\". If this was unusual enough to provoke comment from a newspaper, musicians must have had a nerve-racking time of it. So when did concerts become something to pay close attention to, in silence? It's a change which seems to have happened gradually, and undoubtedly has a complex explanation. The change may have been accelerated by the two world wars, the way they changed people's view of life, and their perception that art - especially music - had the power to console, uplift, provide escape. It may also have something to do with the decreasing popularity of religion in the west. For a lot of my friends, art has a status in their lives which is quasi-religious. I don't mean that they worship it, but that they look principally to music, painting and literature for spiritual meaning or illumination. Creative artists sense this and try their best to provide it. Interpreters try to bring those spiritual qualities alive. And so for many players and listeners, concerts are a serious activity. Audiences don't only want musicians to play well. They also hope for an extra dimension which takes them into new realms of reflection and meaning and, judging from what they say afterwards, many people find in classical music what they're looking for. However, as artists have come to feel that their task is important, so audiences find their behaviour under review. Early in the 20th century the pianists Rachmaninov and Cortot refused to begin if there was noise and distraction in the hall. Sir Thomas Beecham was admired for refusing to start an orchestral concert until the audience had stopped coughing and fidgeting. For years now, major concert halls have routinely placed requests in the programme booklet for coughs and sneezes to be stifled. Mitsuko Uchida stopped in the middle of a Wigmore Hall recital because mobile phones were disturbing her. Andras Schiff walked off stage in Israel recently for the same reason, returning to give the audience an earnest speech about \"the terrorism of noise\". Steven Isserlis wrote in the Guardian about the unacceptable distraction of people coughing and nodding off in his line of vision. Even with a beautifully-behaved Japanese audience, I have come close to asking the hall manager to make a plea for less uninhibited coughing after the interval. Clearly we players feel that silence is the only context in which our playing can blossom. But what does it mean? Have artists assumed a priestly role? Or has classical music become rigid? One could easily find people to say yes to each question. People who stay away from classical concerts would cite \"stuffiness\" as a reason. On the other hand, devotees would say that this kind of music, thoughtfully played and listened to, is a highlight of their lives. However, alongside the transformation of art music into a serious activity comes the rise of the entertainment industry, focusing, of course, on pop. Now here is music specifically designed to entertain. And it's fantastically successful. It's also based on an elaborate pretence. Whole careers are based on people not being who they really are, not saying what they really think, and not looking as they naturally look. In fact, some of the stars admit that they can't sing or play the instruments we \"see\" them playing. We are bludgeoned into overlooking all this pretence and revelling in the fact that music is first and foremost an entertainment. The richest, most successful musicians in the world are entertainers and proud of it. But entertainment is only a small part of what I hope to do. Mozart described going to a fair shortly after his opera The Marriage of Figaro was first put on. Already there were hurdy-gurdies cranking out his arias, to his and everyone else's delight. But Thomas Ad\u00e8s, whose new opera The Tempest opened at Covent Garden in February, would be very lucky if he were to walk into a club two months later and find people dancing to his music. And who knows whether he'd like it? There's a big split now between popular and serious music, a split that would probably surprise Mozart. I would be ludicrous as a pop star, and I wouldn't fancy Kylie Minogue's chances of mastering Schubert's piano sonatas. Music today is in an uncomfortably divided state. Is it this that makes me grind my teeth when someone thanks me for entertaining them? \u00b7 Pianist Susan Tomes performs with the Florestan Trio.
