The Brexit secretary announced the move in the Commons after it became clear that the government could face defeat on an amendment laid down by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve that calls for a meaningful vote. \u201cIt is clear that we need to take further steps to provide clarity and certainty both in the negotiations and at home regarding the implementation of any agreement into United Kingdom law,\u201d said Davis, outlining the plans for the withdrawal agreement to be subject to primary legislation. \u201cThis agreement will only hold if parliament approves it.\u201d Davis\u2019s offer amounted to verbal assurance that parliament would be able to vote on the withdrawal agreement, covering issues such as citizen rights, the financial settlement and transitional arrangements, but would not include a future trade deal. He also added that it could not be used to undo Brexit. Grieve welcomed the offer but said that a verbal reassurance from ministers was not adequate, and confirmed that his amendment would remain in place for the time being. It is due to be voted on in the coming weeks as the existing EU withdrawal bill goes through its committee stage, although a firm date has not yet been set. His Conservative colleague Anna Soubry confirmed that she and others were still ready to rebel, arguing that Davis\u2019s announcement would not give politicians any say in a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario, under which the government failed to reach an agreement with the EU. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the announcement a \u201csignificant climbdown from a weak government on the verge of defeat\u201d but added the detail would be critical, while some Labour backbenchers went further, dismissing the move as a \u201csham\u201d and a \u201cfake meaningful vote\u201d. Opponents of the government pointed out that MPs were not being given the power to send ministers back to the negotiating table in Brussels if they were unhappy with the deal. They said the offer amounted to a take-it-or-leave-it vote for parliament, under which the alternative would mean crashing out without any agreement. The prominent Brexiter Owen Paterson asked Davis for reassurance that the UK would leave the EU on 29 March 2019 even if parliament rejected the final deal in the debate on the proposed bill. The Brexit secretary replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Davis also repeatedly made clear to MPs that politicians would not be able to slow or reverse the Brexit process simply by amending the proposed bill. Brexit-supporting MPs, including Suella Fernandes \u2013 chair of the Tories\u2019 European Research Group, had asked for assurances the bill could not used to undo the process. Sources added there would be no chance of reopening negotiations off the back of any amendments to the proposed bill and claimed the EU would not accept any changes at that stage. Davis said his \u201cprincipal policy aim\u201d was for the EU deal to be ready by October, 2018, giving time for MPs to scrutinise and debate it before 29 March 2019, but he would not guarantee that to be the case. Some MPs said they feared the proposed vote for MPs could be delayed until after Brexit had already taken place. Grieve welcomed the concession but told the Guardian that verbal assurances were not enough to fully placate potential rebels. \u201cI welcome the announcement today that parliament will be asked to approve any withdrawal agreement by statute but it remains the case that the bill as drafted does not reflect what the government is now promising \u2013 and the bill will therefore have to be changed to meet the government\u2019s promise,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that my amendment won\u2019t be necessary but it will remain there to be debated and if necessary voted on.\u201d The Tory rebel also criticised the government for putting forward what he called an \u201cextraordinary amendment\u201d last week under which the date of Brexit \u2013 29 March 2019 \u2013 would be written on the face of the EU withdrawal bill. Grieve said that would tie the hands of ministers by taking away any possibility of extending article 50 in an emergency. Soubry added that incorporating the date into the bill meant MPs would have \u201cno say\u201d if the government failed to negotiate a deal in the timeframe on offer. Davis responded that the need for unanimity from 27 other EU countries to extend the timeline meant doing so was an unlikely option. Soubry told the Guardian that she believed that the government was \u201cpreparing for a hard Brexit \u2013 no deal\u201d, adding that she would still back Grieve\u2019s amendment and was ready to rebel on the issue of the exit day. The Labour MP Chris Leslie, who has laid down a number of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill being debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday, said he thought ministers would still face a rough ride. \u201cDavid Davis was clearly trying to stave off rebellions but nobody seems to be buying it. It is quite clearly a con trick. Giving parliament a vote after the deal is signed and done is worthless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear that MPs should be able to shape the deal before it is signed and sealed.\u201d His colleague, Chuka Umunna, said the move did not preclude Britain crashing out without a deal. \u201cIt is not a big concession ... He calls it a meaningful vote, it is a fake one,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The Brexit secretary has been forced to deny reports that he was furious at his cabinet colleagues Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, after they formed an alliance to write to the prime minister about fears of \u201cinsufficient energy\u201d in parts of government over Brexit. The Times reported the claims, quoting an unnamed ally of Davis. His spokesman hit back. \u201cThis is flat wrong. How cabinet colleagues interact with each other is up to them and David Davis defended Boris when given the chance on Sunday.\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will say in a speech on Tuesday when the EU withdrawal bill returns to the Commons, that it is an undemocratic government power grab. \u201cNearly 17 months since Britain voted to leave the EU, we are still none the wiser as to what our future relationship with our biggest trading partners is going to look like,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe government can\u2019t give a lead because the cabinet is split down the middle. Ministers spend more time negotiating with each other than with the EU. That gives the whip hand to grandstanding EU politicians.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
