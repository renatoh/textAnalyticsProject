But this was an afternoon when homegrown players reinforced the fact that the future is very bright at the Wolves. This had all the makings of a dangerous day\u2019s work for Steve Price\u2019s side, with defeat here opening the door for third-placed Catalans to mount a serious challenge on the top two. However, not only did the Wolves strengthen their grip on second with victory \u2013 opening up a six-point gap over the Dragons and fourth-placed Hull in the process \u2013 but they did so with a number of positives to boot. Seven of the team came through their own junior system. The 17-year-old full-back, Josh Thewlis, made his professional debut with an assured display. A year ago, he had just finished sitting his GCSEs, and was playing junior rugby with his amateur club in Oldham. On Saturday he outperformed his opposite number Tony Gigot, man-of-the-match in last year\u2019s Challenge Cup final, and underlined that while Warrington continue to spend at will on big-name imports that philosophy will be supported by fine junior talents in the years ahead. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have put him in if I didn\u2019t think he was ready,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bright future. I\u2019m big on giving opportunities to the local community kids and that\u2019s our system going forward. Hopefully, there\u2019s a few more to come.\u201d Thewlis was given the standing ovation his performance merited when he was replaced with seven minutes remaining. The game was arguably still in the balance going into the final quarter. Catalans had taken the lead in the first half thanks to Fouad Yaha\u2019s try, but two tries in the final nine minutes of that half, from Blake Austin and the outstanding Daryl Clark, pushed Warrington 12-4 ahead at half-time. The scoreline was perhaps harsh on the Dragons at that stage. The effects of a draining few weeks began to show on Catalans thereafter. They have spent the past month on the road, with games at the Nou Camp, Anfield and, most recently, Hull in the Challenge Cup last week. That the Wolves scored 22 unanswered points during the second half is no surprise given that arduous schedule. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to France now and regroup,\u201d said the Catalans coach, Steve McNamara. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult lately and you\u2019ve seen that in our last couple of second-half performances.\u201d Shortly after the hour mark, Bryson Goodwin and Sitaleki Akauola crossed for tries to break Catalans\u2019 wilting resistance and from there, it was clear there would only be one winner. Catalans, by this point ravaged by injuries and players succumbing to concussion, barely mustered a resistance in the final quarter and it was no surprise when Josh Charnley seized on an error to score Warrington\u2019s fifth try."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
