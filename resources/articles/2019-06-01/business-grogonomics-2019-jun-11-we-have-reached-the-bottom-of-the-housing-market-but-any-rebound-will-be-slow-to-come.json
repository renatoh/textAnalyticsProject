This view is most egregiously put forward with respect to the housing market, where the story goes that as Labor was proposing changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing, people were holding off buying homes because of worries about house values. Thus with the Coalition winning the election, the market will now rebound. Now, I grant you there is frequently not much logic with markets which will often react to \u201cthe vibe\u201d as much as reality, but nothing about the election result has changed the fundamental picture of the economy. And given the ALP was grandfathering the negative gearing and CGT changes, logic would have you thinking that it would drive people to enter the market in order to take advantage of them before the changes came into effect. As it is, the latest figures on the housing market suggest any improvement had started before the election result, but we should be pretty wary about getting overly excited \u2013 when we talk improvement we really mean \u201cless bad\u201d. The latest housing finance figures, released on Friday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, show that the value of housing finance commitments in April was 19% below what they were a year earlier: The big driver of the falls remains investment, which is 27% down over the year. But it does at least not appear to be getting worse. When we look at the monthly growth we see that the bottom appears to have been reached around October last year. Since then the value of finance has continued to fall but at slower rates \u2013 to the point where we should expect the total value of housing finance commitments to start increasing sometime in the next six months: We can see this broadly reflected across the nation. Only in South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT is the monthly growth of finance commitments worse now than it was six months ago: But we should not underestimate how far the market has to go to recover from the current falls (which are still continuing). In New South Wales the value of finance commitments in April were 5.7% down on what they were in December, 23% below April last year and a massive 45% below the peak month of February 2017: The big drop in these falls would have you thinking that housing affordability must also be much improved on what it was \u2013 after all, the value of housing finance commitments are 45% below what they were two years ago. But alas, this does not mean a similar sized drop in affordability. In NSW, the peak month for owner-occupier housing finance commitments was August 2017 (investors left the market earlier, which is why the peak month for total finance was earlier in the year). In April the value of housing mortgages for owner-occupiers was 20% below what it was in August 2017, but the number of mortgages taken out was also 23% below: What this means is the average size of mortgages has not fallen. In August 2017, the average size of a owner-occupier mortgage in NSW was $457,079. In April this year it was $479,437 \u2013 a rise of 5% \u2013 slightly more than the increase in male full-time average earnings in that state. While the heat has certainly come off the housing market \u2013 especially in Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 and housing affordability is better now than it was in 2015 when the growth in the value of mortgages was outstripping the growth in the number, it remains a pretty tough place to take out a loan. In NSW, if we assume a level of income growth consistent with the past two years, the average mortgage in April was worth around five times the average male full-time annual earnings \u2013 that is better than the 5.2 level in 2015, but still worse than it was a decade ago, and much, much worse than it was at the start of the century: House prices should still be expected to stay weak \u2013 and most likely falling \u2013 for at least the next six months. While the level of housing commitments does not lead perfectly to house prices, historically they lead the market for a good six months. This suggests that while things should be getting less bad for house prices, any talk of a market rebound is still some way off. The Reserve Bank cutting interest rates will have an impact \u2013 but as it coincides with winter, which is generally the poorest time for house selling, any rebound will likely be slow to come. The bottom looks to have been reached, but the return to the surface still has a way to go. And unfortunately for those hoping for further improvements for housing affordability, unless incomes begin to improve rapidly, housing affordability is unlikely to get better any time soon. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
