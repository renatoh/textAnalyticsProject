Featuring a basic colour scheme minus the flashy graphics, Spinroom is simple to use and definitely one for the cyber-gambling virgin. Blackjack, poker, roulette: you can play them all for fun. Then get your visa card out and do it for real. The Basingstoke Town Football Club site dedicated to all things football. Bet on a cup, a league or a team then select your target from anywhere in the world from a list of thousands. Go for a safe 5/1 bet that Fulham will be relegated next season - or take your chance on a 66/1 that Japan will win the World Cup in 2002. Either way you can take the plunge instantly and pay by debit or credit card. Flutter is a betting site with a difference. This time you're not up against the bookies: you're gambling person-to-person. And you can gamble against your peers on anything from golf to the financial markets. The odds are now 13/2 that base rates will be cut by 0.5% on July 5 if you're interested... Eurobet is the online arm of bookmakers Coral. The site allows you to bet on anything from football to the dogs - as well as having quite a few opportunities for a flutter on Big Brother. And if you're worried about getting caught gambling in the office, Eurobet also allows you to gamble via WAP-enabled phone or interactive TV. Calling itself \"the most respected name in British bookmaking\", William Hill certainly has the advantage of being a well-known household name. As you would expect the site is comprehensive and easy to use (if a little dull) and if you're not a whiz at maths, don't worry, there's a handy calculator to help you work your winnings out. Plus, they'll email you free tips to your desktop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
