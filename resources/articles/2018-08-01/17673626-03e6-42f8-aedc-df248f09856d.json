Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team defeated United 3-0 on Monday thanks to a second-half Harry Kane header and two Lucas Moura goals. Lloris pointed to how his charge on Friday had not been ideal. \u201cIt was a tough week especially because of my mistake but I think the team showed they are strong,\u201d the goalkeeper said. \u201cThere are always some key moments in the season and I think this game came at the perfect time. \u201cWe showed again the togetherness and made a great game against United. It is always a big challenge to come to Old Trafford to face United and this time we got the result that we wanted.\u201d Harry Kane believes the win has laid down a marker regarding Tottenham\u2019s title challenge. It was Tottenham\u2019s first at Old Trafford under Mauricio Pochettino and gives them a maximum nine points from three games, placing them second to Liverpool on goal difference. Kane, asked whether it was a statement of intent, said: \u201cYeah, 100%. We\u2019ve maybe fallen behind at the start of the season the last few years, so we have to stay up there from the very start. The only way to do that is to come here and win, and all the other big games as well. A great start for us. We\u2019re not getting too carried away, of course. It\u2019s only three games in but that\u2019s what we needed.\u201d The forward said he is unfazed by Spurs having bought no one in the summer. \u201cThe gaffer said he\u2019s not just going to bring in players for the sake of it. What that does is it gives the rest of the squad huge belief because it shows he has belief in us, so now we have to repay him for that and repay the club for that. \u201cLucas is one of them that some fans might have thought: \u2018Is he going to stay, is he going to go?\u2019 He\u2019s stayed, and he\u2019s worked hard and he\u2019s done well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
