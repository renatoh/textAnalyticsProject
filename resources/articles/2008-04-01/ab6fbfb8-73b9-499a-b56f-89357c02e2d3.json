It was presented to him on Friday morning, a mere 12 hours after Rangers had completed the first leg of their Uefa Cup quarter-final against Sporting Lisbon. Smith at the time would still be reflecting on the dishevelled performance of his team in a scoreless draw at Ibrox from which Rangers were fortunate to escape undefeated. Reaching the last eight of the European tournament during March was one of the achievements that brought the manager the accolade - capturing the CIS Insurance Cup and beating Celtic to stretch their lead in the Premier League to six points were others - but events on Thursday night hinted at forthcoming vindication of TS Eliot's observation that April is the cruellest month. For the near 50,000 who witnessed it, the largely non-threatening performance against the Portuguese would not be entirely surprising. Rangers have been habitually unimpressive over the past couple of months, but have consistently salvaged rewarding results that have, at the time, appeared improbable. To the club's followers, the most disconcerting aspect of this latest outing would be the lifelessness that seemed to afflict most areas of the team. Possibly as a result of the overall lethargy, the little breaks that have frequently arrived at opportune moments to get Rangers out of bother in recent times went into hiding. Carlos Cu\u00e9llar acknowledged the sudden loss of impetus in his team-mates when he said that 'maybe we didn't have the freshness we had two or three months ago'. The redoubtable Spaniard once again stood fast at the heart of the defence while his veteran partner, David Weir, unusually went through an ordeal of uncertainty, culminating in the yellow card - for a deliberate body check on the marauding Yannick Djal\u00f3 - that renders him ineligible through suspension for the return on Thursday. Weir's obstruction could yet prove to be valuable, as the Sporting substitute was bolting into space to receive a through pass and, unimpeded, might have scored the goal the visitors had threatened through the closing stages, a time when Rangers, uncharacteristically, looked on the verge of capitulation. That the Ibrox side should come through the test without conceding - preserving their unblemished defensive record in home matches since they were parachuted in from the Champions League - was clearly a comfort to Smith. By lunchtime on Friday, he was able to rationalise the situation, drawing a certain optimism from his team's capacity for damaging opponents away from home. They scored three in Lyon and two in Stuttgart in the Champions League and the single against Panathinaikos in Athens took them into the last 16 of the Uefa Cup. Smith could also be encouraged by remembering Celtic's run to the final of the tournament in 2003, at times overcoming difficulties remarkably similar to those faced by Rangers now. Then under the management of Martin O'Neill, Celtic played so poorly in the first (home) leg of their tie with Blackburn that Graeme Souness described the difference between his team and the Scots as 'men against boys', despite Celtic somehow securing a 1-0 victory. In the return, O'Neill's team produced optimum work, a comfortable 2-0 victory assuring their progress. In the semi-finals, another downbeat performance against Boavista in Glasgow produced a 1-1 draw, giving the Portuguese side a clear advantage in the return. Henrik Larsson's goal in Oporto took Celtic into the final, but O'Neill confided some time later: 'What was really eating me up was that we looked for a long time like being eliminated by the worst team we had played in the competition.' Smith could not be expected to make the same comment about Sporting, but he will surely be convinced in private that Rangers in Europe this season have faced better teams and that a return to their earlier form could yet bring salvation. 'People might look at Sporting and say we've played better teams,' he said, 'but that doesn't mean they don't have a capability for doing well. You'd expect matches at this stage to be tight and, with the exception of Zenit St Petersburg's surprising 4-1 win in Leverkusen, that's how it has proved. 'We actually achieved the best result of all the four home teams, with Bayern and Fiorentina both drawing 1-1. Although we didn't play as well as we have, the result wasn't a bad one for us.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
