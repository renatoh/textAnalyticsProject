A 33-year-old Sudanese asylum seeker was arrested after the attack at Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re, in the Dr\u00f4me department in south-east France, on Saturday morning. Two other men, both said to be from Sudan, one of whom shared a flat with the suspect, are also being questioned in police custody. The national counter-terrorism brigade, PNAT, announced on Saturday evening that it had opened an investigation into \u201ckillings and attempted killings connected to a terrorist organisation\u201d and \u201ccriminal terrorist conspiracy\u201d. The suspect, who arrived in France in 2017 and was granted refugee status and given a 10-year residency permit, moved to Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re in January after two years in Moras-en-Valloire, to the north, where he worked in a leather goods store. Aur\u00e9lien Ferlay, the mayor of Moras-en-Valloire, told French television that the man had undergone professional training in leatherwork supported by social services and the charity Secours Catholique. Ferlay said he was \u201cboth stupefied and horrified by this attack\u201d, which he said had left everyone \u201ctotally mystified\u201d. \u201cNothing, absolutely nothing, made us think he would carry out this terrible act. He went to work on his bicycle, he was polite with my staff and me and he posed absolutely no problem in our community,\u201d Ferlay said. The local newspaper, the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, said the man had been working in a factory at Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re, a town of 33,000 residents, and was unknown to French and European police and the security services. A statement from the counter-terrorism prosecutor\u2019s officer said a search of the suspect\u2019s apartment had uncovered \u201chandwritten documents with religious connotations\u201d. It said the as yet unidentified author of the documents \u201ccomplains in particular that he lives in a country of sinners\u201d. The suspect entered a tobacconist shop on Saturday morning and allegedly attacked the owner and injured the shopkeeper\u2019s wife when she tried to help her husband. He then went to a nearby butcher\u2019s where witnesses said he jumped over the counter, grabbed another knife and stabbed a customer before running out and attacking passersby in the street. A computer engineer aged 44 was killed while inside the butcher\u2019s shop. The second casualty, named as Julien Vinson, 55, the owner of La Charrette, a cafe theatre, was stabbed in the street while trying to protect his 12-year-old son. A third man, aged 63, was in a serious condition in hospital and four other people \u2013 two men, 65 and 59, and two women, 48 and 49 \u2013 were also injured. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the attack as \u201can odious act that has brought grief to a country already sorely tested in recent weeks\u201d. The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who travelled to Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re after the attack, referred to the suspect\u2019s \u201cterrorist background\u201d. He said: \u201cI commend the full engagement of the security forces who quickly apprehended the suspect and who are now carrying out the investigation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
