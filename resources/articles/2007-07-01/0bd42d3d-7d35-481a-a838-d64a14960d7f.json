The Spaniard, who turned 50 earlier this year, was admitted to a hospital in his home town of Santander on June 17 after complaining of heart palpitations but was discharged the following day. He underwent tests during which doctors discovered he was suffering from an irregular heartbeat. \"It is nothing too serious and he is well enough to travel to next week's Open Championship at Carnoustie,\" Iv\u00e1n Ballesteros, Seve's nephew, said last night. The player's family described as \"completely untrue\" reports in the Spanish media that he had tried to commit suicide after the recent death of a close friend in a car accident. Ballesteros, who is now eligible for the Champions Tour, has struggled with a back injury in recent years and has not tasted victory since the 1995 Spanish Open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
