For most of this year, you could read multiple condemnatory stories a day about Meghan Markle doing this or that at Wimbledon or her baby shower or wherever \u2013 and absolutely nothing about Prince Andrew being accused of doing this or that with the then teenage sex slave of his international child-sex trafficker friend. Yoohoo, newshounds, over here! And so to the latest helpful diversion in this endlessly entrancing general election \u2013 a row over a clip of Boris Johnson that Channel 4 News wrongly subtitled. They had the prime minister saying, \u201cI\u2019m in favour of having people of colour coming to this country\u201d, when in fact he was saying \u201cpeople of talent\u201d. If you somehow missed this shitshow, it\u2019s best summarised as \u201cperson who has said multiple racist things didn\u2019t say this particular racist thing but the cockup has played right into his hands\u201d. Also, you\u2019re the UK\u2019s last pure human. Can I come and hide out where you are for the next five days? The drama has, alas, come at just the right moment for the Andrew Neil-dodging Johnson campaign, with a \u201csenior Conservative source\u201d having already begun Friday by sniffing: \u201cThe public are fed up with interviews that are all about the interviewer and endless interruptions.\u201d Ooh, everyone\u2019s a critic. \u201cThe format is tired and broken and needs to change.\u201d In fact, the Tories think the format of our entire democracy needs to change, and we\u2019ll be coming to the ominous page 48 of their manifesto in a minute. A bit more looking-the-wrong-way to do first, though. For now, no one is disputing the Conservative campaign\u2019s right to be furious that Channel 4 miscaptioned their boy. Although, guys: have some perspective. If you\u2019re cool with the \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d, and the Muslim women being letterboxes and bank robbers, and the fact there was a real-life spike in hate crimes linked to your man\u2019s words \u2026 then you can\u2019t exactly wet your pants about someone claiming he conflated \u201cimmigration\u201d with \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. That\u2019s like an axe murderer whingeing about red-eye in his mugshot. As for the conspiracists still arguing he said \u201ccolour\u201d not \u201ctalent\u201d, despite a BBC clip proving otherwise \u2013 why waste the time? We already know Johnson says racist things. He wrote lots and lots of them down, and they were published, under his name, for years. Decades, in fact. And there are so many of them that they are still being dug up like a vast subterranean hoard of casual bigotry. The real outrage is the reflexively opportunistic attack by the Tories on Channel 4 News and the wider media, who they\u2019ve spent the entire campaign trying to cast as the CNN to Johnson\u2019s Trump. Yes, we\u2019ve seen all this before \u2013 and it ends up being a way of wriggling out of scrutiny. \u201cThis sort of thing is why so many media organisations have collapsing audiences,\u201d laments \u201ca senior Conservative source\u201d. \u201cWe sadly do not expect the senior management at Channel 4 to take this terrible mistake seriously and we expect more of the same.\u201d Oh please. Spare me the Johnson campaign\u2019s sudden discovery of standards, the sanctity of accuracy and the whole hanky-to-the-nose tone of their condemnation. They can lie for Britain \u2013 or rather, against its interests. So we know we have a prime minister who needs to be kept away from the public. The Tories would really like us to view Johnson in a sort of political safari park, through which paying punters \u2013 and we\u2019re all going to end up paying \u2013 would be encouraged to drive through at some pace. It\u2019s best not to stop, or he\u2019ll climb on your car and pull off your windscreen wipers, or attempt to mate with your exhaust. But even more worrying are those of his policies that need to be kept away from the public. Why does the Tory manifesto only go up to the end of their first notional year of a five-year term? What happens next? What if we WANT spoilers? This entire document rather reminds me of the 2015 Tory manifesto, which used the word \u201cplan\u201d 121 times, devoting a mere seven words to what would turn out to be the most significant aspect of this plan for millions of voters. Specifically: \u201cWe will find \u00a312bn from welfare savings.\u201d Anyway, fast forward to the present day, and page 48 of the Tory manifesto is where all the scary shit is. Voter ID, or voter suppression as it is known everywhere that has it. Which is not currently us, but Johnson wishes to import that democratic poison. Other lowlights? \u201cWe also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution, the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative, the role of the House of Lords.\u201d Oh. Oh dear. The Tories also promise to do something about the irksome business of judicial oversight of the government. Thanks to a lot of looking the wrong way (I certainly include myself in this), the best work on this has been done roots-up on social media, ably taken up by Newsnight this week. Though naturally no cabinet minister \u2013 let alone the prime minister himself, or even his dad \u2013 seems to have cared to come on the BBC programme and discuss it. So where does this all leave us, at election minus six days? The \u201csenior Conservative source\u201d suggests Johnson is focusing on priorities such as NHS investment. Is this when he goes round hospitals and nurses are dragooned into having a cup of tea with him to serve as backdrop? Then perhaps it\u2019s literally going to have to fall to a nurse to ask the prime minister the things people have a right to know, because no one else is going to get a sit-down. I mean, I guess if you want something done, ask a busy person. Even so, contrary to what the \u201csenior Conservative source\u201d reckons, it does feel like the more \u201cbroken\u201d entity might not be the set-piece political interview. It might in fact be a system where \u201cscrutiny\u201d is hoping a nurse breaks off from healing the sick in order to ask the prime minister what precise democracy-fucking initiatives he has planned for 80% of his elected term. Thus the final few days of campaigning stretch before us like a far-fetched movie plot. Realising that the only people with access to the villain are eyerolling medical workers, leading broadcasters of a malfunctioning fictional country study his upcoming election schedule, then select one nurse from a hospital he\u2019ll be visiting next Tuesday. They now have just 72 hours to train her up in the ancient art of asking the right questions. Luckily, that\u2019s her average shift time. But I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 that\u2019s impossible! It takes a lifetime to learn these journalistic skills! You can\u2019t learn it 72 hours! And yet. Yes, they hadn\u2019t banked on the badass heroics of Nurse X, and the result is an against-all-odds Christmas movie with strong Die Hard themes, in which a single cameraphone catches her looking up from Tetris-ing trolleybeds into hospital corridors to go: \u201cYippee-ki-yay, prime minister! Why are you trying to put government above the law? Also: how many kids have you got?\u201d Sandra Bullock stars. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian journalist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
