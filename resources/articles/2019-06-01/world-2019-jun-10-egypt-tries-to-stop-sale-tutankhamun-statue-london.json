The statue, a brown quartzite head of the young pharaoh, which portrays him as the ancient god Amun, is expected to raise more than \u00a34m at auction on 4 July. But Egyptian officials have called on Christie\u2019s to prove the statue left the country legally. \u201cWe will do our best to stop this auction immediately,\u201d said Dr Mostafa Waziri, the head of Egypt\u2019s supreme council for antiquities. \u201cWe will talk to the Egyptian foreign ministry and our ambassador in London to do our best to stop it, as we have to check.\u201d The 28.5cm-high statue is more than 3,000 years old and \u201cexudes strength and serenity\u201d, according to the Christie\u2019s listing. It shows the head of Amun with the \u201cslightly drooping lower lips, and almond-shaped, slanted eyes with a deep depression between the eyes and eyebrows\u201d of Tutankhamun. The listing says similar representations of Amun with Tutankhamun\u2019s facial features were carved for the temple of Karnak in upper Egypt. Egyptian officials fear the statue was taken from the Karnak temple complex, a vast ancient site in the southern city of Luxor. The statue \u201clooks like it came from Karnak,\u201d said Dr Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian minister of antiquities. Hawass believes that the statue left Egypt in 1970. \u201cI don\u2019t think Christie\u2019s have the papers to show it left Egypt legally; it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cChristie\u2019s has no evidence at all to prove that, and therefore it should be returned to Egypt.\u201d Dr Shaaban Abdel-Gawad, the head of the anti-smuggling department at Egypt\u2019s ministry of antiquities, said in a statement that officials were \u201cstudying the auction files in preparation for taking the necessary measures\u201d. The ministry also reiterated Egyptian officials\u2019 demand for documents showing proof of ownership. Egypt has stepped up its fight against the sale of looted antiquities worldwide. Abdel-Gawad\u2019s office often leads the way by monitoring auction sites, whose listings often alert the authorities to the presence of treasures sometimes removed from the country decades earlier. \u201cIf it is proven that any piece is illegally exported, all legal procedures are taken with Interpol, in coordination with the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs in order to ensure its return,\u201d said Abdel-Gawad. \u201cWe will not tolerate or allow anyone to sell Egyptian influence at all.\u201d Christie\u2019s says the statue will be auctioned from the private Resandro collection in July, in a sale that includes marble heads dating from ancient Rome, a painted wooden Egyptian coffin, and a bronze Egyptian cat statue. \u201cThe present lot was acquired from Heinz Herzer, a Munich-based dealer in 1985. Prior to this, Joseph Messina, an Austrian dealer, acquired it in 1973-74 from Prinz Wilhelm von Thurn und Taxis, who reputedly had it in his collection by the 1960s,\u201d the auction house said. A spokeswoman for Christie\u2019s defended the sale. \u201cAncient objects by their nature cannot be traced over millennia,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is hugely important to establish recent ownership and legal right to sell which we have clearly done. We would not offer for sale any object where there was concern over ownership or export.\u201d She said the statue was previously widely exhibited, and that Christie\u2019s informed the Egyptian embassy in London before the sale. \u201cThere is a longstanding and legitimate market for works of art of the ancient world, in which Christie\u2019s has participated for generations. Christie\u2019s strictly adheres to bilateral treaties and international laws with respect to cultural property and patrimony,\u201d she said. Waziri said: \u201cChristie\u2019s can say whatever they like. But I\u2019ve seen pictures of the head and I have to check. If we can get better pictures, I can say if it\u2019s similar to the ones in Karnak or not. I can\u2019t say anything until I see the head itself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
