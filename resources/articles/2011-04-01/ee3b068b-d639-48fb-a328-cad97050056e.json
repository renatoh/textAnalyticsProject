Until then \u2013 certainly until he drags himself out of his latest slump \u2013 the dialogue continues. In a frank and illuminating exchange, Murray has spoken in depth for the first time about their relationship and made it clear that, contrary to public perceptions, Judy is a benign rather interfering influence in his professional life. As he prepares for his return to Europe's clay in Monte Carlo this week, the Scot is yet to decide who will replace the recently departed Alex Corretja as his coach \u2013 and that leaves the vacuum that Judy occupies in her intense way at courtside, the original mothering hen. Asked how their relationship worked, he said: \"Ninety-nine per cent of the time she speaks to me like anyone's mum would. And then there are times when I decide that I want to talk to her a bit about tennis, about the guys I'm working about, how I'm feeling. And she's there to listen and understand. \"A lot of people I'm sure might find that very difficult to understand but she knows me well. She knows when to speak to me, when to be positive, when to tell me off and explain things to me. When I speak to her about tennis, it is when I need some help from her, some ideas, or even if it's just to listen to.\" But when it was put to him that any future coach has to understand his mother will always \"be there\", Murray bridled at the implication that she would be a disproportionate presence. \"She's my mum,\" he said emphatically. \"If it wasn't my mum, I'd be speaking to my best friend, or whoever. I don't think every player limits themselves to discussing how they're feeling about their job or the sport they're playing to just the people that they work with. \"That's something that the guys I work with have got better and better at \u2013 sitting down and discussing things. But there are also times when you need advice when you're thinking about changing something. \"It's something you need to get from other people. It's not as if my mum is the only person I speak to about that. There are other people: my management team. Everyone is there to give advice, but I have to decide who I want.\" Murray would like to hire a coach before Wimbledon. \"It's more likely that, if it doesn't happen in the next two or three weeks, it would happen straight after the French, or after Wimbledon.\" He did put to bed the rumour that he sounded out Tim Henman for the job, while leaving the door slightly ajar for his friend. \"That didn't happen. I don't know. I might speak to Tim. He's around, he's an ex-player and I'm sure he could help me out in a lot of respects, but I think he's quite happy on the golf course, to be honest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
