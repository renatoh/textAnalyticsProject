Two fires were reported aboard the vessel, which was 150 miles south east of Aberdeen, according to a spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Speaking on BBC News 24, he said that Scottish coastguards had been in contact with the Master of the passenger ship: \"The vessel appears to be suffering from two fires. One appears to be under control and the other, which is in the funnel of the ship, is being dealt with. \"At the time it was reported, the Master decided that his own fire fighting equipment could handle the blaze. Initially he reported an engine room fire, which is far more serious. We obviously know they have a considerable amount of fire fighting equipment but we are standing by if the order is given to abandon ship\", said the spokesman. The RAF later said a Nimrod and eight helicopters were taking part in the rescue operation. A spokesman said: \"At the moment they are getting into positions where they can lift the passengers off if necessary and put them onto nearby oil rigs. \"There is no doubt it's a full-scale emergency, the biggest mobilisation anyone can remember for a long, long time.\" He said the fire was in the engine room and the funnel of the ship, but there were no casualties on board and the rescue services would only evacuate if it became necessary. \"If we have got to take them off then we have to, but ideally we want to keep them safe on the ferry,\" he said. The ferry is operated by DFDS Seaways and runs between Newcastle, Kristiansand in Norway and Gothenburg in Sweden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
