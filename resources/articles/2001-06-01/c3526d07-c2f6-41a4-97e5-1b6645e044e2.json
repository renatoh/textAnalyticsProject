The Italians Marco de Marchi and Patrizio Billio did not join the squad for pre-season training this week for Dundee's first-round first-leg tie against Sartid Smederevo of Yugoslavia at Dens Park. Dundee's player-manager Ivano Bonetti said: \"They know we have this competition but we have only 16 fit players - plus me. They have had their last chance.\" The club had already fined the pair \u00a325,000 for failing to attend training. Both are in Italy, where they have now spent several weeks since the end of the season in May. Their lawyer has appealed against the earlier fine to the Scottish Football League. Dundee's players have hardly had time to put their feet up before the start of a new season. Quicker than it takes most clubs to descend on the beaches of Spain for the perfunctory team jolly, Dundee are back playing. They will hope to echo their glory days in Europe. Courtesy of Dundee's European Cup run to the semi-finals in 1962-63 and Dundee United's similar progress in 1983-84, the self-styled City of Discovery can be bracketed along with football powerhouses such as Glasgow, Madrid, Milan and Belgrade. Dundee's last serious sortie into Europe was in the Uefa Cup, during the 1974-75 season, and the adventure only got as far as the first round. Apart from De Marchi and Billio, Claudio Caniggia, now transferred to Rangers in a deal of around \u00a31m, will be missing. The Georgian internationals, Giorgi Nemsadze and Zura Khizanishvili, have been allowed to extend their holiday because of World Cup duty earlier in the month, and Beto Carranza has been granted time off to be with his wife, who is due to give birth. Bonetti has included himself in the squad, his last outing for the club being in January. Also back from injury is Marcello Marrocco. And last season's top scorer, Juan Sara, will be keen to put his words into action after his announcement on Thursday that the club's desire for him to remain on Tayside is reciprocated. Hibernian have reported West Ham to the Scottish FA after the London club were linked to their manager Alex McLeish in the run-up to the Scottish Cup final. Hibs' managing director Rod Petrie is calling for the English FA to charge West Ham with bringing the game into disrepute. The Hammers declared an interest in employing McLeish to replace the sacked Harry Redknapp just days before Hibs' 3-0 defeat by Celtic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
