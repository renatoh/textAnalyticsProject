While denying the government did a \u201csecret deal\u201d with the key crossbencher to win over her support in a crucial vote on Wednesday, Morrison said the government\u2019s existing policies had convinced Lambie to support the repeal after she was provided with briefings from senior government officials. When twice asked if the government\u2019s existing policy included resettling refugees to New Zealand once the US resettlement deal was exhausted, Morrison said: \u201cThe government\u2019s policy is to ensure that we seek to resettle people who are on Nauru. \u201cThe government is always looking at ways in which it can resettle those who are on Nauru. \u201cSo we will continue to use the arrangements that we have in place to be able to resettle people and that is the assurance that we have provided.\u201d New Zealand Immigration minister Iain Lees-Galloway said the \u201coffer remains on the table,\u201d but there had been no recent approach. \u201cIt\u2019s on the table and we\u2019re happy to help if they want to take the offer up. We\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the medevac regime had undermined the government\u2019s efforts to resettle refugees, saying it allowed a \u201cback door\u201d to Australia that removed an incentive for people to accept relocation to the US. \u201cLike Senator Lambie, like everybody, I don\u2019t want people, the prime minister does not want any of these people on Manus or Nauru, and we worked day and night to clean up Labor\u2019s mess to make sure that we get people off, and also at the same time not restart boats which is what happened under Labor.\u201d He said the medevac law was a \u201cbad policy\u201d that deserved to be voted out. Ahead of the Senate vote on Wednesday, Lambie told parliament that she had made the \u201creally hard decision\u201d to support the legislation\u2019s repeal because the government had agreed to an \u201coutcome\u201d that would improve medical treatment for refugees held in offshore detention. She has refused to disclose details of the proposal she put to government, citing national security reasons. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked to an outcome I believe we both want, which is an outcome that our borders are secure, the boats have stopped and sick people aren\u2019t dying waiting for treatment,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cAnd as a result of that work \u2026 I am more than satisfied that the conditions are now in place to allow medevac to be repealed.\u201d Advocate groups condemned the government\u2019s decision to repeal the law, saying it was a \u201ccallous and vindictive\u201d political move to end the medical evacuation system that had seen almost 200 people transferred to Australia for treatment. \u201cToday is a devastating day,\u201d GetUp\u2019s human rights director, Shen Narayanasamy, said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is medevac, a law that has saved lives, be ripped away. \u201cThe Morrison government has chosen to deny sick people the right to medical care, against all expert medical advice.\u201d Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone also criticised the decision. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the politics of this issue, I\u2019m worried about the people, the patients here at the centre of this system,\u201d he told the National Press Club. In question time on Wednesday, Labor asked the government to reveal details of the agreement struck with Lambie. Morrison told parliament that Lambie had not made any reference to a deal in her remarks to parliament, and denied there had been any special agreement. \u201cSenator Lambie is fully aware of the government\u2019s policies, and is pleased with those policies, and today she has supported those policies,\u201d Morrison said. He then attacked the Labor party\u2019s record on border protection, saying they had sent women and children to Manus Island. \u201cI will not take lectures from the Labor party that showed themselves to be the most outrageous treatment of women and children in sending them to Manus Island and then did nothing while we sought to stop the deaths at sea.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, called on the government to release details of the undertakings it had given to Lambie. \u201cThis is a sad day for democracy but, I have to say, I think it\u2019s an incredibly sad day as well, for those people on Manus and Nauru, for those people in Papua New Guinea, those refugees and asylum seekers who need medical treatment,\u201d Keneally said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just put medevac through the parliament last year because we wanted to, we put it through because it was absolutely necessary to do so to ensure that sick people get to see a doctor and get the medical treatment they need.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
