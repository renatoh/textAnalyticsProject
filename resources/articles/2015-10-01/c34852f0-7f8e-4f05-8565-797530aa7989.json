It also spared Italy the embarrassment of a first home defeat in a qualifying match for nine years. Norway kicked off in the second and final automatic place and ahead of Croatia by two points. And they appeared on course for France when Tettey, of Norwich City, opened the scoring in the 23rd minute. The midfielder hit a low shot beyond Gianluigi Buffon to put Italy\u2019s streak of 49 consecutive unbeaten home qualifying matches under threat. But Antonio Conte\u2019s side dominated thereafter and equalised through Florenzi\u2019s close-range effort in the 74th minute. The comeback was completed nine minutes later with a shot from Southampton\u2019s Graziano Pell\u00e8 that flew into the top-right corner. It also ensured qualification for Croatia \u2013 who won 1-0 in Malta \u2013 while Norway finished third and will have to do it the hard way, through the play-offs. \u201cWe did what we had to do,\u201d Conte said later. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to lose. I always want this intensity and this nastiness. We\u2019re on the right road. It\u2019s important to have this approach, whether you win or lose.\u201d Italy won the group with 24 points and Croatia, who had a point deducted for a swastika that was painted on the pitch before June\u2019s 1-1 draw against Italy in Split, finished second with 20. Norway took third place with 19 points. \u201cThey were much better than us in the 90 minutes and they, of course, deserved to win,\u201d the magnanimous coach of Norway, Per-Mathias Hogmo, said. Italy\u2019s last defeat in a qualifying match was 3-1 to France in September 2006. Conte was without several key midfielders, with Daniele De Rossi suspended and injuries to Andrea Pirlo and Marco Verratti. Still, his team were able to take control and create several chances before Tettey gave Norway the lead. A header from Pell\u00e8 that went narrowly wide in the 35th minute was Italy\u2019s best chance of the first half. Roberto Soriano then had a long shot pushed wide by Orjan Nyland, who also negated efforts from Pell\u00e8 and Florenzi in the second half before the equaliser arrived. The substitute Sebastian Giovinco crossed from the left and Haitam Aleesami attempted to stop it with his chest, leaving the ball for Florenzi to poke in. Less than 10 minutes later Giovinco was again involved as Pell\u00e8 finished off a counterattack following a cross from Florenzi. Norway finished with only one shot on target, Tettey\u2019s goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
