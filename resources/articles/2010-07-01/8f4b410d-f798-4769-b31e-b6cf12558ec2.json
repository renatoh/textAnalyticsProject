Better comes across like a rougher, less pleased-with-itself Vampire Weekend, and stuffs tons of ideas into its 205 itchy, skittery seconds, not least the percussive flail, which is every bit as brilliant as it sounds. Paul Harris Vs Eurythmics I Want U (White Label) There isn't much of a \"versus\" to speak of here, given that the Eurythmics' contribution to this little confection consists of about 20 seconds of one vocal sample, but since the accompanying video features an evil-looking sock puppet, we will forgive Dirty Vegas bloke Paul for this slightly dramatic billing. I Want U is slowly swelling, euphoric house with a trancey edge, doesn't overstay its welcome, and almost certainly sounds great if you're caked off your chob, as it were. Sock puppets help, too. Maxsta East London Is Back (Defenders Ent) To those of us who enjoy whiling away a Sunday afternoon working our way through a paperback in one of Bow's finer drinkeries, the news that east London was ever away will come as something of a surprise. Maxsta is a mere 18 years old and comes equipped with a yappy, pugilistic rhyme flow which, though pretty elementary, is here well complemented by the minimalist tootling and synth claps of the track, all of which has inspired this writer to get to work on an answer record, entitled simply Tulse Hill Is Rubbish. Basshunter Saturday (Hard2beat) If Basshunter really was a hunter of bass, diligently scouring the Earth for compelling, gut-depth thumplines, then you'd have to say that his entire career has been a failure. However, given that he spends most of the video for this entirely aggregational Euroguff being felt up by several of the most attractive females who have ever lived, in alarming states of undress, who am I to, with straight face, accuse him of failure? He's not just living the dream, he's living mine as well! Esmee Denters Feat Justin Timberlake Love Dealer (Polydor) Love, I am told by those who have experienced it, is quite good fun, so it's odd to hear the Dutch chanteuse Esmee choose, as her particular metaphor for it, the relationship between a drug dealer and a fiending addict (\"I can be your dealer/ I can be your only friend\" \u2013 how could any man refuse?). If that's what it's really like, I may stick to bachelordom and the seemingly inevitable porn library that goes with it. Anyway, this all amounts to some forgettable soft raunch, with Justin not so much phoning or faxing it in as posting it second class in a leaking Jiffy bag."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
