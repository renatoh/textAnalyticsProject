Her parents were \"devastated\", her friends were going off to university, \"and everybody had decided that my life was over at this point\". Today, aged 34, as she receives an MBE for entrepreneurship, London-born Huie, founder of multicultural greeting card company ColourBlind Cards, said the recognition was significant not for where she is today, \"but probably the distance that I have travelled\". Praised for her work mentoring young entrepreneurs, Huie, like the majority of honours recipients, is one of the many extraordinary ordinary \u2013 those who are not household names, but whose quiet achievements have made a difference. They include school caretakers, charity fundraisers, foster carers and hospital volunteers to name just a few, from the Scilly Isles to the Outer Hebrides. Huie's \"epiphany moment\" came when her daughter, Monet, was seven and led her to give up a career in public relations to start ColourBlind Cards. \"She didn't like her hair. She wanted straight hair. She has this beautiful afro hair and I went looking for a card which would depict a black or brown-skinned princess, to send a subtle message to her that 'you are perfect just as you are'. And there was a complete absence of anything in the high street which represented anyone of colour.\" Today, her cards sell in Asda and Clinton Cards, she has expanded into South Africa and just launched in the US. \"The cards aren't about race in any way, they just have images of people of various colours, particularly the black and mixed-race community,\" she said. In the process, she has discovered \"my purpose on this planet is to share the fact that with resilience, determination and hard work, anything is possible\". Foster carers Avril and Ronald Head, from Croydon, who receive MBEs, have seen 138 children, many disabled, pass through their home over the last 30 years. The couple, who have three birth children, also adopted two others, one severely disabled, with complex medical needs. \"Some have stayed a long time, some only a short time, but we hope that we have made a difference to their lives and helped them on their way to adulthood. We have loved all of them,\" said Avril, 62. An emotional Ronald, 64, paid tribute to their three birth children. \"They have shared everything throughout their lives, including their parents,\" he said. \"And we are just so proud of them. \"It is simply a way of life. We don't think of it as any form of work.\" The Rev John Wood, 56, dedicated his MBE to the team at St Ann's Church, in Tottenham, north London, who have helped play an active role in building local relationships following the 2011 riots. When he first arrived at the church, he said, he was \"clinically depressed, having panic attacks, and didn't actually lead a service or preach for two years. \"The reason I have even got this award is that the church there took me as I was, they said they wanted me anyway.\" From humble origins, the 40-50 strong team he leads runs a counselling project in 27 schools, provides youth support on five estates including Broadwater Farm, and provides chaplaincy services to the police. \"I commit my MBE to the people who put their faith in me and continue to work for us at St Ann's,\" he said. \"We are not giving hope to Tottenham. There is already hope in Tottenham and we are seeking to exploit that\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
