Celtic issued angry statements after the dismissal of their captain in last Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Ibrox and following the SFA's decision to throw out their appeal. It had earlier emerged that Celtic had arranged a meeting with the SFA in a bid to raise their concerns over a series of refereeing decisions. Mowbray had remained publicly subdued on such matters until today, when the manager cited what he perceives as errors by officials in other meetings between Celtic and Rangers this season as contributing factors to the Brown affair. Mowbray claimed he was \"bewildered\" by the sending-off. \"Another Old Firm game comes along and another contentious decision which has a big effect on the game,\" Mowbray said. \"Maybe another decision in a massive Old Firm game not to go Celtic's way would be just a little bit too much. If it [Brown's appeal] had been upheld, it would have been proven to be a wrong decision, I think. So maybe the political decision was taken that the right decision had been made.\" On the specific Brown incident, Mowbray added: \"I don't want to get in to a conflict but I like to think I'm not a paranoid guy. I'd like to think I'm a balanced individual. I look at the reasons and at what went on, I look for fairness, basically. If I could see a grey area and think: 'I can half-see what the referee is thinking but I don't agree with it,' then fine, but having watched it, I can't come to that conclusion.\" The Rangers midfielder Kevin Thomson has had what will be interpreted as a dig at Celtic by claiming that Dougie McDonald, the referee who issued the red card to Brown, is the best in Scotland. \"I thought the referee was good on Sunday and in my opinion Dougie McDonald is the best in the country,\" Thomson said. \"I have said that to him numerous times. I always tell him it is a pleasure at the end of games as I think he's a good referee. I felt on Sunday the decisions he made were good ones as he was always going to be in the spotlight and under pressure. Whether other referees could have handled that, I don't know. He coped terrifically.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
