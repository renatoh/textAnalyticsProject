Where Geordie building workers once sought better pay and jobs on German construction sites, unemployed German apprentices are now crossing the Channel to find work in the UK. Two of them, Alex Schiffer, 23, and Uwe Strack, 25, have upped sticks from Cologne this month to help meet a growing shortage of engineering skills at Thames Water, owned by Essen-based utility group RWE. The pair could swiftly be followed by others as Germany is suffering from a surfeit of trained apprentices in a weak economy, while Britain is chronically short of them in sectors such as engineering and construction. Thames's human relations director, Martha Desmond, said imported skills were vital to deliver the company's \u00a33bn investment programme. \"In the UK we are facing a serious shortage of young people opting for a career in engineering-related professions. The situation is acute for us in London and the Thames Valley where a logjam of big infrastructure projects - Terminal Five, the new Wembley Stadium and our own work to modernise Victorian main and sewerage networks - means engineering skills are in high demand.\" Thames Water is not the only utility being forced to take action to address skills shortages, though others are looking towards more homegrown solutions. Yesterday Scottish Power, itself the subject of a potential bid from Germany's E.ON, said it had teamed up with a number of organisations, including the Prince's Trust, to train young Scots from deprived areas to fill what it described as a \"major skills shortage in the energy industry.\" The government has set energy companies targets to reduce consumption through a series of measures, including improving home insulation. But Everwarm Services, one of Scottish Power's partners in the scheme, said demand was so high it was proving tough to find experienced workers. \"The only way we see forward is to train new younger people and bring them into the industry which is desperately short of skilled installers,\" said the chairman Bob Graham. Network Rail, responsible for maintaining Britain's rail network, has launched a series of initiatives to tackle a significant skills gap and lack of numbers. These include setting up a new apprenticeship scheme, with a first intake last month of 300. Thames, which trains young unemployed Britons to detect leaks in water mains, says home-grown action to address the skills shortage is not enough. It is still looking to fill 70 vacant posts - a common experience in a sector where 22% of employers report skills gaps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
