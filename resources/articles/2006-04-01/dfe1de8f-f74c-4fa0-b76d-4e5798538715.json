That will produce hollow laughter in public-sector workplaces. The deal that was reached with the government on public sector pensions last year did not provide for retirement at 60 for all public servants for ever. Instead, the negotiations secured three main things. First, the government achieved the future savings targets it wished. Second, the unions preserved the pensions promise made to, and built up, by existing public servants. Third, each public sector scheme is now negotiating new schemes for future recruits - no different from common practice in private-sector pension schemes. The fat cat jibe is even more misplaced when it comes to local government. The standard local government retirement age is already 65, apart for those with extremely long service. The average local government pension paid to women pensioners is just \u00a331 a week. Brendan Barber General secretary, TUC Max Hastings is right to draw attention to the growing inequalities in pension provision. Many public sector workers may have little idea of the enormous value of the pension benefits they enjoy. A schoolmistress retiring at 60 on a pension of \u00a320,000 holds an asset which the annuity market would value at more than \u00a3500,000. With the average private sector pot reportedly below \u00a340,000, the disparity has become grotesque. Many civil servants, even if they don't know it, are pension millionaires. To most private sector workers, approaching such sums is a hopeless fantasy. Private-sector workers who, for decades, were saving perfectly adequate amounts now find their savings will deliver nothing like their expectations. Conversely, public workers have seen massive growth in the value of their pension, with the cost borne by taxpayers. Such a stark division is unhealthy. Public workers understandably want to retain their privileges, but if they appreciate the full facts, then only those of the most extreme and unfeeling capitalist outlook will wish to maintain their fat-cat status at the expense of the less fortunate. David Oliver Cambridge Max Hastings seems unaware that the NHS and local authority superannuation schemes are contributory, requiring the member to pay 6% of gross earnings. The benefits accrue at the rate of 1/80th of the final salary to maximum of 40/80ths for each full year of contribution. Thus a \"full pension\" for a person who has contributed for 10 years with a final salary of \u00a316,000 pa will get \u00a340 per week. These are among the few opportunities for the poorly paid to save for their old age without enriching the true fat cats, the financial industry. Or does Hastings believe, like Blair and his cronies, that pensions, like dental treatment and decent housing, are the perquisites of the better-off? Rod Bulcock Bingley, W Yorks If Max Hastings had any genuine concern with social justice he might look at top private-sector executives who have frequently closed final salary schemes to their workers, while ensuring platinum-plated retirement at 60. Among directors of FTSE-100 companies, 43 have accrued pension payouts of more than \u00a3400,000 a year, while the combined pension pots of some 360 directors exceeded \u00a31bn. George Binette Camden Unison convenor Can I bring to Hastings's attention the plight of those thousands of \"well-paid\" administrators at the other end of the scale who have worked for years in the NHS? Should I be able to retire at the age of 60 (which is doubtful), my recently received pension forecast advises me that I shall have an annual pension of \u00a32,999.90 and a lump sum of \u00a38,999.70 to look forward to. This will be after giving 24 years' service to less-than-appreciative members of the public while performing my job for the NHS.
