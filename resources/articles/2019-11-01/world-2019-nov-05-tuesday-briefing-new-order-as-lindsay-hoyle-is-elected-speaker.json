Lindsay Hoyle has been elected Speaker of the House of Commons as successor to John Bercow. The 62-year-old Labour MP for Chorley \u2013 the only candidate who refused to say how he voted in the 2016 EU referendum \u2013 became the 158th Speaker after beating six others in a secret ballot. The Lancastrian has promised to bring calm to a chamber that has seen divisive and bad-tempered debates over Brexit. In keeping with tradition, fellow MPs Caroline Flint and Nigel Evans \u201cdragged\u201d Hoyle to the Speaker\u2019s chair after the result was announced. Historically, the powerful job sometimes led to his predecessors\u2019 deaths on the orders of the monarch of the day. Hoyle will take up the role on Tuesday for a single day before parliament dissolves for a general election on 12 December. The Speaker traditionally severs all ties with their political party and stands in their seat unopposed. First, though, Hoyle is expected to be called upon to allow an urgent question about the government\u2019s failure to publish before the election a report by the intelligence committee on alleged Russian interference in the UK, including in the 2016 referendum campaign, and how to safeguard against it. The government has claimed the report needs more time to be signed off \u2013 however the committee denies this, and it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies under a process going as far back as March. Downing Street received a final draft nearly three weeks ago. * * * \u2018Shock\u2019 at smear plot against Biden \u2013 Testimony has been released by congressional investigators of two senior American diplomats who spoke about a White House plot to conjure political dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine. P Michael McKinley, a former ambassador, returned to service at the request of Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, but resigned in shock at efforts inside the department to manufacture dirt on Trump\u2019s political opponent. \u201cAnd if I can underscore, in 37 years in the foreign service and \u2026 working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that,\u201d McKinley testified. Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed by the Trump administration from her post as ambassador to Ukraine, told investigators she felt \u201cshocked\u201d when she found out that Trump had said of her to Ukraine\u2019s president: \u201cShe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d \u201cI was very concerned,\u201d said Yovanovitch. \u201cI still am.\u201d \u201cDid you feel threatened?\u201d she was asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied. Seeking advice on how to staunch attacks from Trump\u2019s emissary Rudy Giuliani, she was told to tweet something nice about the president. * * * Drone pilots will need licence \u2013 Drone users in the UK must now sit an online test and pay a \u00a39 annual fee or face a \u00a31,000 fine. Drones weighing more than 250g \u2013 basically, all but the smallest toys \u2013 must be registered and marked with a unique licence number. The government announced the register in 2017 in response to growing concern over drone use, from smuggling drugs into prisons to disrupting airports. The plan predated the closure of Gatwick airport in December 2018 when a drone was repeatedly flown near the runway. Owners are obliged to identify and label all drones by 30 November and operators must pass a test about legal and safe usage before they can fly them. The Civil Aviation Authority estimates 130,000 people will have to pay and register by the end of the month. The CAA is launching an accompanying \u201cdrones reunited\u201d site to track down owners of wayward drones and return them. * * * Baghdadi family rounded up \u2013 Turkey claims to have captured the sister of killed Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and is interrogating her along with her husband and daughter-in-law, who were also detained. A senior Turkish official said Rasmiya Awad, 65, was seized on Monday during a raid near the Turkish-controlled northern Syrian town of Azaz. When captured she was accompanied by five children. \u201cWe hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi\u2019s sister on the inner workings of Isis,\u201d the official said. Baghdadi blew himself up, along with two children, when cornered in a tunnel by US special forces in north-western Syria. * * * Parents\u2019 drinking marks children \u2013 More than a third of children in the UK are negatively affected by their parents\u2019 alcohol use, research has suggested. Children surveyed \u2013 who were aged between 10 and 17 \u2013 reported negative experiences including being given less attention than usual, being put to bed earlier or later than the usual time, arguing with parents, and being at the receiving end of unpredictability. Children were more than twice as likely to report a negative outcome if their parents had negative motives for drinking, such as coping with depression or to escape other problems. Ian Hamilton, an expert in addiction and mental health from the University of York, said: \u201cWith cutbacks to mental health services, alcohol may be the only way that some people feel they can cope with their feelings and they may be oblivious to the impact it has on those around them.\u201d * * * Run it past me again \u2013 Any amount of running can reduce your risk of early death, according to researchers, who say their findings push back against previous suggestions that health benefits might be lessened for people who run a lot. In the latest study, significant benefits were seen even among those running once a week or less, less than 50 minutes a week, or at 6mph or less. There was no bigger reduction in the risk of early death at greater levels of running. According to the World Health Organization, about 3.2 million deaths each year are down to people not doing enough physical activity.
