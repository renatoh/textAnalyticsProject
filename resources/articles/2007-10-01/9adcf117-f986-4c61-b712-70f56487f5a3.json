A week of declines in stock prices was completed when gloomy news from some of America's leading companies intensified concern that the crisis in the US housing market was starting to infect the rest of the economy. Dealers also reacted badly to the leak of an early draft of the communique from G7 finance ministers in Washington, which urged the Chinese to let their currency appreciate but made no mention of the ailing dollar. By the close of business on Wall Street, the Dow was down 366.94 points at 13522.02 - a 2.5% fall on the day and a drop of more than 4% over the week. The broader based Standard &amp; Poor's index and the technology-rich Nasdaq also registered hefty declines, raising the possibility of knock-on falls in far east and European markets when they open for business on Monday. Analysts pointed out that yesterday's fall, while the biggest for two months, was nowhere near as severe as that on October 19 1987, when the Dow lost more than 20% of its value in a single day's frenetic trading. Wall Street was jolted yesterday by a profit warning from the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which has seen its business badly affected by the drop in construction activity caused by sharp cuts in house building. Caterpillar said the US residential property market was in severe recession and warned that there was a 50% chance of a full-blown US recession next year. Policymakers attending the G7 meetings in Washington are deeply anxious about the state of the global economy and expressed surprise that shares had been performing so strongly until recently at a time when oil prices were soaring, the dollar was falling to record lows and credit markets around the world had frozen. Wachovia yesterday became the latest leading US bank to announce losses as a result of the credit crunch, reporting a 10% fall in profits in the third quarter and a $1.3bn write-down as a result of the market turmoil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
