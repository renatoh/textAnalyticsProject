The pricetag is not quite that clear-cut. The Alto holdall photographed with Angelina Jolie in Cambodia for a new Louis Vuitton advertisement appears originally to have cost in the region of \u00a3850-\u00a3950, having belonged to the actor for several years. The holdall is due to be reissued soon, but the company says it will not give an advance indication of the price. \u2022 Summarising remarks made by Chris Patten, a news item described the BBC Trust chairman as telling the Sunday Telegraph he hoped to lobby the foreign secretary to modify plans that could see some World Service language services close when Foreign Office funding for World Service radio comes to an end in 2014. In fact, he was speaking of closures mooted before the 2014 funding watershed (Patten vows to defend World Service from cuts, 13 June, page 9). \u2022 A story reported that Michael Gove planned to set tougher exam targets for \"Britain's worst performing schools\". As the piece said elsewhere, the Gove plan applies to schools in England; the education secretary's remit does not extend to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (Schools told to raise the bar on GCSE results, 15 June, page 1)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
