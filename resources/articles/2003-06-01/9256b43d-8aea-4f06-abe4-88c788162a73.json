Colin Parker thinks it's ridiculous: \"United will lose many, repeat many, of their overseas fans if they get rid of him. I may not pay to watch the team at Old Trafford week-in week-out, but I spend at least \u00a3300 a year on Man United merchandise. \"I will not spend a penny on the team if they attempt to disgrace the England captain this way. Beckham is a positive member of the club and it's the manager who is the bad apple spoiling the atmosphere.\" And Noel Fowles, from his outpost in Canada, agrees: \"Ferguson is a disgrace and he should be the one traded. United should offer money to anyone who will take this classless act.\" Similarly, and if you're still reading, Fergie, turn away now, Paul Smith says: \"What a strange, sordid and sorry spectacle we are witnessing. Posh and Becks may be vulgar, but truly Peter Kenyon, Alex Ferguson and Manchester United have no class.\" However, David Brown is not the only one prepared to overlook the boardroom politics to consider what the move could do for Dave's football career. \"Barcelona would be good for Becks as he'll improve his game and hopefully turn around a rather dull team and make them a force once more in Europe.\" A word of warning arrives, however, from Bo Vibe, a rather chilled-sounding correspondent. He or she, we really can't tell, doesn't think Beckham would be considered the best thing since paella on the streets of Barcelona. \"You're demonstrating a poor knowledge of Spanish and, specifically, Catalan football, if you think a Beckham move to the Camp Nou will spawn celebrations along Las Ramblas,\" (s)he warns. Scarlett Biarstad, another Canada-based reader, rather strongly echoes this view: \"I have an intense hatred of David Beckham and I don't want any part of him corrupting my beloved Barcelona. \"Barca is my life and soul and I don't care about how many shirts he sells. Nor does it matter how many fans we pick up in Asia if he does join, they'll all dump us once Real Madrid steals him from us anyway. Look out, there's more. \"Barca only needs real fans who support the whole club, not screaming Japanese adolescents who lick Beckham's hotel toilets (no disrespect to the Japanese). Buying him doesn't guarantee any trophies. He's not even the best player at Manchester United.\" There was more, but it didn't get past our eagle-eyed censors. We pity Becks, truly we do. Unwelcome in Barcelona and unwanted in his homeland too, at least where Vincent Nordell is concerned. \"His performances for United during the last two seasons have been patchy at best - a point the British media seems to miss entirely,\" he scribbles. \"Selling Beckham makes sense, money-wise and football-wise.\" Beckham's market value is obviously something Rick Hardisty has thought about too. \"Considering the number of Manchester United shirts around the world which have 'Beckham' emblazoned across the back, if only 10% of the owners, or more likely their parents, decide to purchase a new one, how much money will United make?\" Don't answer that, readers, it's rhetorical. Kimamowa Wahome also has pound signs in his eyes, writing: \"This would be an excellent move by United. Despite Beckham's reputation and his marketing value, he is highly overrated as a footballer. \"United will restock in a major way with the fees from David's transfer to another club and it would soon be 'David who?'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
