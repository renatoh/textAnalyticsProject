The tall, dark and handsome A-lister apparently likes nothing better than a spot of foxtrot, and we bet many high-heeled, pouting ladies have gone home broken-hearted having failed to win his hand for a bit of cha-cha-cha. We can't promise you'll be dirty dancing with the likes of Keanu, but you'll certainly have fun on one of the many dancing holidays run by Dance Holidays in the UK, Europe and even as far as Argentina. Dance Holidays (01293 527722; www.danceholidays.co.uk) offers a four-night break to the Tango Festival in Seville 7-11 October for \u00a3395pp including flights and hotel B&amp;B accommodation. Four hours' tuition costs around \u20ac32 (\u00a321) for advanced and \u20ac45 for beginners. RAFTING Golden Globe and Academy Award winner, the new face of Calvin Klein lingerie and voted one of People magazine's 500 Most Beautiful People, Hilary Swank must give her agent the jitters every time she goes off on 'holiday'. That's because Swank's idea of fun is to indulge in the high excitement activity of white-water rafting. Originally from Nebraska, she's naturally a lover of the outdoors and takes every opportunity to swap the glamorous gowns and high heels of her Hollywood life for a life jacket, a helmet and a paddle to brace the ice-cold waters of raging rapids. \u00b7 Okavango Tours and Safaris (020 8343 3283; www.okavango.com) offers a three-night, action-packed break at The River Club, a colonial lodge on the banks of the Zambezi close to the Victoria Falls, the adrenaline-junkie capital of Africa. You'll do one day's white-water rafting, a bungee jump from Livingstone Bridge over the Zambezi and a half-day elephant-back safari for \u00a31,878pp sharing, until the end of October, including flights, transfers and full-board accommodation. FLYING While other lady royals stick to skis and horses, the Duchess of York prefers an even more daredevil means of transportation. Fergie is qualified to fly both fixed wing and rotor aircraft and loves to take to the air whenever she can. Apparently, during her training at the Oxford Air Training School, the face and body of Weight Watchers talked incessantly on the radio during her lessons, earning her the nickname 'Chatterbox One'. And no doubt her passion for rotors was inspiration for her Budgie, the Little Helicopter books. \u00b7 Sloane Helicopters (01604 790595/ 00 34 971 794132; www.sloanehelicopters.com) runs courses at schools in Northampton and just outside Palma, Mallorca. It takes three to four weeks to get your helicopter licence and costs \u20ac21,000 (\u00a314,000). Many flyers start the course in Britain then finish off in Mallorca. To get a taster, Sloane also runs helicopter tours of the island. An hour costs \u20ac280pp, based on three passengers. British Airways (0870 850 9850; www.ba.com) flies to Palma from \u00a369 return. A week in a luxury Mallorcan farmhouse in Deia, sleeping up to seven people, costs from \u00a31,050 in low season to \u00a32,250 in high season with Mallorcan Farmhouses (0118 947 3001; www.mfh.co.uk) POTTERY Anyone who has seen Johnny Vegas perform live will probably already know this, but he's passionate about pottery. Often incorporated into his stand-up routines, pottery is more than just a hobby for this oversized comedian. 'It's spirituality meets craft, meets sensitivity meets jug,' he once philosophised. 'There is an erotic element to ceramics, but there is also that vulnerability of putting something in the kiln and wondering will it survive, will it come out as you want it? That unpredictability, it's the relationship between you and mother earth.' Yes Johnny, whatever you say! \u00b7 You too can arouse your passion for pottery on a break with Ridge Pottery (01935 850753; www.mud2fire.co.uk) which runs courses in Queen Camel, near Yeovil in Somerset. The five-and-a-half day course takes students through the basics to a woodfiring or two at the end.

Accommodation in nearby farmhouses and B&amp;Bs costs from \u00a316pp per night. SKYDIVING 'Even from a very early age, I knew I didn't want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous,' said Nicole Kidman once in an interview. True to her word, one of her favourite pastimes is skydiving, one of the most exhilarating but also potentially risky activities around. The Australian has no qualms about throwing herself out of an aeroplane at 15,000ft and must have made the day of any instructor who was lucky enough to share a tandem dive. \u00b7 If you're going to take the plunge, you might as well do it at one of the world's most spectacular destinations - Queenstown, New Zealand. If you book and depart before 14 August, Austravel (0870 166 2070; www.austravel.com) offers a three-week package from \u00a31,599pp, based on twin share, including Qantas flights, three nights in Auckland, an eight-night North Island Wanderer self-drive tour, four nights in Wellington and seven nights in Queenstown. Here, you can complete your trip with a sky dive course. To attain an A license rating you are required to have completed 25 solo jumps costing NZ$ 2330 (\u00a3830) with Nzone (00 64 3 442 2256; www.nzone.biz) A tandem 15,000ft jump costs NZ$395 (\u00a3140). MOTORSPORT Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay has a passion for anything that moves fast, be it on two wheels or four, and is a regular at many major motor racing events. He was one of the first customers for the \u00a3500,000 Formula One-based supercar Ferrari Enzo, but he's not the only speed junkie in the celebrity world. Other Formula One fans include Boris Becker, David Letterman, Ryan Giggs, Kenneth Clarke, P Diddy, Robbie Williams, Rio Ferdinand and Mick Hucknall. You don't have to be a multi-millionaire to do the Formula One circuit. Crystal Holidays (0870 165 0144; www.crystalgrandprix.co.uk) runs a programme of coach, car and air holidays to the races around the world from March to October, so you too can feel the 600-plus bhp of the cars vibrating every bone in your body. A three-night trip to Monza on 12 September costs \u00a3299pp by coach or \u00a3525 by air (flying from Stansted) with B&amp;B accommodation in a three-star hotel. Race tickets cost from \u00a340 Saturday and \u00a360 Sunday and transfers to the track are included. ANGLING Is it a) bream b) roach c) perch or d)pike? Well, if Chris Tarrant is having a good day, it could be all four. The Who Wants to be a Millionaire? presenter and DJ is a fanatic fisherman and in the few spare weeks in between his various jobs, he's likely to be found knee deep in water brandishing a rod. \u00b7 You can tread the same waters as Chris Tarrant at Belle Isle (0286 638 7231; www.belleisle-estate.com) on Lough Erne in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. An overnight stay at Belle Isle Castle starts from \u00a360pp B&amp;B, based on a two-night stay and four people. A week in a self-catering apartment starts from \u00a3360.

Return flights start at \u00a355pp. POLO Plenty of celebrity beauties love to watch the polo (or at least hang out in the champagne tent) but not many of them actually play. Supermodel Jodie Kidd is one exception. Jodie was born into a horse-loving family, and starting with showjumping soon moved on to the tougher sport of polo. Her split from professional polo player Tarquin Southwell hasn't killed her love for the game. Her penchant for speed also extends to motor racing (she's currently training to qualify for next year's Maserati championship), and she's a pretty good golfer too with a 16 handicap. Don't you just hate her! \u00b7 A passion for polo doesn't come cheap and the sport should be done in style. Where better than the resort of Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic. With three playing fields, one practice field, 80 polo ponies and instructors, it's ideal for beginners and medium-goal players (tuition is $67 per hour, plus taxes), while advanced players can hire ponies for stick and ball tournaments. From 23 August to 31 October, Caribbean Vacations (020 7636 3311; www.caribbean-vacations.co.uk offers seven nights for \u00a31,520pp based on two sharing on an all-inclusive basis and flights with American Airlines. KNITTING Hailed as the new yoga, knitting has become the hobby of choice for A-listers who reach a certain ... erm, how shall we say it ... phase in their lives. It's hard to know which celebrity kicked off the knit-one, pearl-one fashion, but no doubt trendsetters Madonna or Sarah Jessica Parker were among the first. The celebrity knitters circle is huge - Parker's Sex and the City pal Kristin Davis, Kate Moss, Bridget Fonda, Geri Halliwell, Sandra Bullock, Eva Herzigova, Ulrika Jonsson, Iman, Julia Roberts, Winona Ryder, Goldie Hawn, Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah, Sandra Bullock, Brooke Shields, Cameron Diaz and even, (can you believe it), Russell Crowe. Is there really that much demand for woolly scarves in Hollywood? \u00b7 Forget knitting with your granny at home, join Vogue Knitting editors and guest designers on a seven-day 'Voyage of the Glaciers' cruise along the Inside Passage, from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to Whittier (Anchorage), Alaska, with Specialty Tours (00 1 727 796 7555; www.a1specialtytours.com) on 21-28 August. Prices start from $1,525pp, based on double occupancy, and include 15 hours of tuition, all meals and entertainment and a cocktail reception but exclude flights (the cruise starts in Vancouver and ends in Anchorage). PAINTING Best known for his role as the braindead bruiser in the classic Eighties Rocky movies, there's a whole different side to Sylvester Stallone. Beneath his slurring speech impediment and his pumped-up physique lies a talented and sensitive painter. Stallone began painting while at college, earning enough money to make it to Hollywood, and has even earned some critical acclaim for his works. Like his acting, he has developed a very distinctive style in his works of art, squeezing paints directly onto the canvas and favouring bold strokes and vigorous splashes of colour. \u00b7 Discover your artistic side on a watercolour painting holiday in Zakynthos, Greece, with Peligoni Club (01243 511499; www.peligoni.com) Weekly courses run from 2-23 September and cost from \u00a3515pp (with \u00a340 discounts for those who share). Price includes painting instruction, transport, meals, cottage accommodation, and use of club facilities such as tennis, sailing and windsurfing, but excludes flights, bar drinks and massages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
