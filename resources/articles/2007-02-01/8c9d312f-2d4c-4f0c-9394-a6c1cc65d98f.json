Hanser Verlag, Pamuk's German publisher, confirmed that the celebrated author had called off a string of book readings in Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart. He was also due to receive an honorary degree at Berlin's Free University. Fears for Pamuk's safety are running high. Last week, Yasin Hayal, the man who police claim has confessed to orchestrating Dink's murder, issued what appeared to be a threat to Pamuk. \"Orhan Pamuk, be smart. Be smart,\" he called out to journalists as he was being taken to an Istanbul courtroom by police. Police are investigating whether his words constitute a threat to the novelist, which could lead to Hayal's prosecution. Both Pamuk and Dink have been the focus of controversy in Turkey after talking openly about the mass killings of Armenians in the early 20th century. They have been accused of the crime of \"insulting Turkishness\". Pamuk is famed for novels such as Snow and My Name is Red, and won the Nobel literature prize in 2006. His publisher said that there were no immediate plans to reschedule the trip to Germany, where Pamuk has a large readership, partly because of the country's sizeable Turkish community. Dink's assassination earlier this month has prompted outrage at home and abroad. Within Turkey it has sparked fierce debate about excessive nationalism as well as freedom of expression."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
