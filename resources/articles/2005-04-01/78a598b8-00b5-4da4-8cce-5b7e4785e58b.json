At the bank's annual meeting in Edinburgh he refused to reveal who the bank had spoken to, but a move does not appear to be imminent. \"Shareholders expect us to be aware of potential opportunities for growth and it would be remiss of us not to have evaluated the opportunities in one of the world's largest and fastest growing economies. \"It is impossible to assess opportunities properly without speaking to people involved in the country concerned - and that is exactly what we have been doing.\" RBS shares have fallen since it was suggested as a possible bidder for a \u00a32bn stake in the Bank of China, the country's second largest bank. There have been calls to use any surplus cash for shareholders, though Sir George says the bank is not sitting on a cash pile. He revealed that Standard Chartered was among the institutions RBS had looked at, but he made it clear that an acquisition of Standard was not on the cards. Sir George handed questions about the bank's remuneration policies - described by one investor as \"strangely worded in non-English\" - to Bob Scott, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee. He said the plans for directors were to motivate them to produce \"superior, sustainable value\". The focus was on Larry Fish, head of the US operation Citizens, who earned \u00a32.3m last year but whose payment from a \"phantom\" share plan is not being disclosed until next year. A new scheme for Mr Fish and 70 US colleagues could pay $28m (\u00a315m) for the first three years; 5% of institutional investors voted against the new plan while 8% of shareholders, including deliberate abstentions, opposed a resolution on the remuneration report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
