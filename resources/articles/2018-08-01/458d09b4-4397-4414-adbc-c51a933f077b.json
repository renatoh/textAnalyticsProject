Richard won a landmark privacy case case against the BBC this summer over a report revealing he was being investigated over historical child sexual assault claims. Rise up, the album\u2019s title track, will be heard for the first time on the BBC, at about 11.25am on Wednesday on Ken Bruce\u2019s Radio 2 show. The album is Richard\u2019s first collection of new songs for 14 years. The title track was written by Terry Britten, who four decades ago co-wrote Richard\u2019s hit Devil Woman, and Graham Lyle. It includes the lyrics: \u201cThey\u2019re never gonna break me down, they\u2019re never gonna take me down, they know I\u2019m gonna rise up feeling stronger.\u201d Richard said: \u201cIt is always great to sing lyrics you can \u2018feel\u2019 and I really felt those words.\u201d Richard said he had been through a two-year period where he could not sleep or think about anything. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to rise up out of what seemed like a quagmire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it will be a revival for me, not only for me personally, but maybe ... I could be recognised by some of these younger people to be a valuable artist. I\u2019m not messing around with it, it\u2019s for real.\u201d Richard has been a fixture of British popular culture since he released his first single, Move It, 60 years ago. The anniversary will be marked with a limited edition single release with the original 1958 B-side Schoolboy Crush. The 77-year-old said he hoped new audiences would be open to his music. \u201cIt has been put to me that a new audience might give me a \u2018listen to\u2019, and that is an exciting thought, and if they do and don\u2019t like it they can buy something else. \u201cGive me a chance, that is all we can ask ... close your eyes and tune in. My longevity should be considered a plus, not a drawback.\u201d The new album was recorded in Miami and includes a duet with Olivia Newton-John on a track called Everybody\u2019s Someone, as well as songs called Gonna Be Alright and That\u2019s What the Night is For."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
