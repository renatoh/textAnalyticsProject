The former England captain, normally among the game\u2019s most diplomatic men, made little effort to disguise his feelings about Yarde\u2019s conduct after it was confirmed the 25-year-old, capped 13 times, has signed a three-year deal with Sale. \u201cI am disappointed in him,\u201d said Robshaw, fully supportive of the decision of John Kingston, the Quins director of rugby, to dispense with Yarde\u2019s services. \u201cMarland\u2019s run out of lives and we\u2019ll be in a better place for it. It\u2019s a massive shame because he\u2019s a talented player but John has made a great stance. As a club we\u2019re going to be in a better place now.\u201d Robshaw\u2019s withering verdict will make it extremely hard for Eddie Jones to recall Yarde to the international fold even if England\u2019s injury problems on the wings fail to ease. When a respected player like Robshaw openly describes a team\u2011mate as a negative influence at club level, it would seem a significant period of rehabilitation will be needed before Yarde can expect a Test recall. It is understood Yarde missed three Harlequins training sessions this season without offering a satisfactory excuse. In August he failed to report for training 24 hours before the squad were scheduled to leave for a pre-season training camp in Germany, claiming he had overslept after taking some sleeping pills. He was subsequently told not to attend the camp in Herzogenaurach and then also missed a routine midweek session. When he failed to turn up for the captain\u2019s run before the Champions Cup fixture against Wasps \u2013 which Quins lost 41-10 \u2013 and could not be contacted by phone, the club\u2019s patience snapped. \u201cEvery decision I make is with the intention of doing the right thing for Harlequins, and that\u2019s the way it will always be,\u201d Kingston said. Yarde, who began his career with London Irish and scored 18 tries in 62 appearances for Quins, will now be looking to make a fresh start in Manchester. \u201cHe is a very exciting player and he will very much suit our attacking style of play,\u201d said Steve Diamond, the Sale director of rugby. \u201cHe\u2019s still very young with his best years ahead of him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
