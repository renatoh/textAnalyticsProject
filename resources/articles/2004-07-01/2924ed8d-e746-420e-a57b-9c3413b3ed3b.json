But the aim was the same - and so was the resulting tangle of wrecked AK-47 replica guns. Along with campaigners in hundreds of other cities across the world, campaigners against \"lax\" gun laws and the arms trade contrived to make a symbolic point about the growing spread of lethal weapons. Guns have overtaken cars in terms of personal possessions globally, the Labour MP Fabian Hamilton told a small but enthusiastic group of gun-crushers in Leeds, before starting his own bit of dismantling with a screwdriver. \"There is now one gun for every 10 people. Some 800,000 are destroyed every year, but for each of them another 10 are made,\" he said. The London gun-squashing, organised by Amnesty International, Oxfam and other partners in the Control Arms Campaign, was attended by Mick North, whose daughter Sophie died in the primary school massacre at Dunblane, which happened eight years ago, on July 8 1996. Mr North said: \"The number of guns are going to spiral out of control unless something is done. \"We are destroying guns today but normally it is lives that are being destroyed, and most of them are civilians.\" The crushings marked Gun Destruction Day, which the campaign has organised with related anti-gun crime groups including Mothers Against Guns and the Gun Control Network. Jayne Atkinson, of Wrexham, whose 13-year-old son George died in an airgun accident at a relative's house five years ago, said: \"Why is it still legal to have a gun at home? Why cannot the government just do more?\" She added: \"I get so bloody angry.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
