The 28-year-old striker, who has been informed by Antonio Conte he has no future at Stamford Bridge, told the Daily Mail that the Chelsea manager lacks charisma and that he is happy to continue accepting fines for refusing to train with the reserves at the club\u2019s Cobham training base. \u201cThey want me to be there training with the reserves,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact with the guys. I\u2019m not a criminal. I don\u2019t think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that. I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me. I take the hit every week but I\u2019m not driven by money. You know that the manager doesn\u2019t want me. I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn\u2019t want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\u201d Costa made a text conversation with Conte \u2013 in which the Italian informed him his Chelsea career was over \u2013 public knowledge in June, insisting he \u201cwould have to find a way out\u201d of the club. But Costa, who scored 20 Premier League goals to help Chelsea win the title last season, said he was close to agreeing a new contract as recently as January at Stamford Bridge but believes Conte intervened before he could put pen to paper. \u201cI was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect the manager was behind it. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that. But as a person \u2014 no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn\u2019t possess ... charisma.\u201d Costa remains hopeful of securing a return to Atl\u00e9tico, where he played for four years between 2010 and 2014 before joining Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea. Costa admits the Manchester United manager has contacted him to \u201ccheck I am OK\u201d and insists he never had any problems with the Portuguese. He adds he has informed the Chelsea director, Marina Granovskaia, of his intentions to depart for La Liga and that he has rejected offers to leave Chelsea, who he accuses of trying to sell him to Chinese clubs. \u201cI want the deal with Atl\u00e9tico resolved this month,\u201d added the Spain striker. \u201cMy idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
