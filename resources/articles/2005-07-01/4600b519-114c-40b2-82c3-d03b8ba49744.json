Officers urging members of the public to leave the area around Broad Street told passersby that they had carried out a series of controlled explosions nearby. Allan Sartori, a Birmingham club owner, told ITV News police appeared to have the situation under control. He said he had himself already returned home, adding: \"I would suspect that everything's pretty calm at the moment and that everyone has moved away and done exactly what they were asked to do.\" Mr Sartori said evacuating the city centre would have cost \"a lot of people a lot of money\". But he added: \"People's lives are far more important than money in a situation like this.\" Earlier, police had banned vehicles from passing the inner ring road. Birmingham is no stranger to terrorist attacks. The notorious IRA pub bombings of 1974 were some of the most serious terrorist atrocities ever committed in mainland Britain, claiming the lives of 21 people and leaving scores more injured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
