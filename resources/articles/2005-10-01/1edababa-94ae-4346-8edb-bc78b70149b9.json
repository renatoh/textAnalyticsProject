The inquiries started after a man approached the police to claim that he had acted as an agent provocateur to provide sensational stories for the NoW. One of the exclusives he claims to have set up was the alleged plot by a gang to kidnap Victoria Beckham. The Yard took the man's allegations seriously enough to send three detectives from its intelligence directorate to see him in Croatia last month. Two more detectives flew to see him in Vienna three weeks later. A Yard spokesman says inquiries into his claims are continuing. Detectives concede privately that the man, Florim Gashi, may be seeking attention. He has a criminal record for dishonesty and, by his own admission, has a history of telling lies. But Gashi told the Guardian: \"I am responsible for innocent people going to jail. I tricked them, and I'm ashamed. It's time to tell the truth.\" While in Vienna he gave formal interviews to lawyers from two firms representing men featured in NoW stories. Gashi was the main source of the Beckham kidnap story, published in November 2002. Five men were arrested and charged with conspiracy to kidnap Victoria Beckham. After being held in custody for seven months, the five appeared for trial at Middlesex crown court, where the prosecutor announced that no evidence would be offered against them because the main witness, Gashi, was deemed to be unreliable. It was revealed that the paper had paid him \u00a310,000. Defence lawyers maintained the men had been \"set up\" and, after clearing them of the kidnap charges, the judge referred the case to the attorney general as a possible contempt of court. The attorney general later cleared the paper of contempt and a separate Press Complaints Commission inquiry exonerated the NoW. Two months ago one of the accused men, Alin Turcu, lost a libel action against the NoW. His lawyers could not find Gashi and believed he was being shielded under the witness protection scheme. In fact, Gashi, an Albanian asylum seeker from Kosovo, was deported from Britain in June. Since then he has been travelling around eastern Europe. In his judgment, Mr Justice Eady said the NoW, as it genuinely believed that a crime was about to be committed, had acted properly. Gashi, 29, originally sought asylum in Britain in 1998. He was convicted twice in 2000 and received suspended sentences. He contacted Mahmood the following year after seeing his name in the paper. Gashi, then working as a car park attendant in Wandsworth, south London, told the reporter that he had evidence of drug-dealing by traffic wardens, but now says he entrapped the men. He claims to have been actively involved in more than a dozen stories which carried Mahmood's byline and contends that, in most, he was guilty of inciting people to commit crimes in order that they could be \"exposed\" by the paper. He claims to have been the main source of a NoW story in March about a teenage mother in Plymouth who agreed to offer her baby for sale. \"I got her boyfriend to persuade her to do it,\" Gashi now says. \"She didn't know what was happening. She was a good mother and I regret being involved.\" Gashi's new claims do not impress a senior detective who worked on the Beckham kidnap inquiry. \"He appears to be telling a third version of his part in the kidnap,\" he says. \"It's impossible to rely on his evidence.\" A News of the World spokesman said: \"No story based on information supplied by Gashi has been published without first being stringently tested and verified with convincing independent evidence. The allegations in respect of the Beckham kidnap plot have been raised before, independently investigated, tested under oath in the high court and been rejected.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
