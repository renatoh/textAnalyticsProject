Is this really going to provide any knowledge that will help the birds, or does it simply enable humans to admire their own technical wizardry? I also saw that the magnificent golden eagle featured on the BBC\u2019s Springwatch, inevitably, had a tag, to allow for research into how reforesting in parts of Scotland might affect numbers. And the white-tailed eagles released into the wild in Scotland, with considerable success and to great acclaim, all have numbers on, and many have electronic tags. Shouldn\u2019t the eagles be left alone to get on with it?
