In a speech to bankers at Mansion House in London, Sir Callum said that while the City \"stood up well\" to the events of July 7, more needed to be done. \"But we should not be lulled into any complacency. July 7, for all the heartbreak of more than 50 people murdered and still more maimed, was not an extreme or even a very taxing test of financial stability,\" he said. \"It was neither aimed at, nor did it have a major impact on, the financial services sector. We cannot count on any future attack being of this nature. It is therefore important that we learn lessons from July 7, and apply those lessons to circumstances which can easily be envisaged and which would constitute a much more severe test, Sir Callum said.\" The FSA works with the Bank of England and the Treasury - known as the tripartite authorities - to play out scenarios to test how the City will react to any disruption to the financial system. The next test is scheduled for November 28 and while the details of the exercise have not been published it is expected to involve \"civil contingency aspects\" and an \"international dimension\". Companies around the City participate to test their operations. The idea is to test all aspects of the financial system, including the computer networks that process the money that moves around the financial world. The last one was held a little under a year ago. When the bombers struck on July 7 some offices around Liverpool Street in the City were evacuated, including those of the Swiss bank UBS. Sir Callum said it was the responsibility of firms and exchanges to repeatedly test their back-up arrangements for potential attacks. He also used the speech to highlight the strength of the financial services industry, where banks were \"thriving\" and the life insurance industry was now recovering from its difficulties in 2000 and 2001. Separately, the FSA said it had fined the independent financial adviser CFS Independent \u00a325,000 for \"serious systems and controls, risk management and compliance failures\". The City regulator found that its senior management had lacked the necessary knowledge and expertise to ensure it could comply with key regulatory requirements designed to safeguard clients' money and assets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
