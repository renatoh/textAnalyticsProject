Dr Louise Richardson, a specialist in international politics, became the university's first woman principal last June. The two previous incumbents in the job, Dr Brian Lang and Professor Struther Arnott, were both given honorary membership of the golf club which has more than 2,000 members from all over the world \u2014 every one of them male. Critics have argued this \"no women\" policy is an anachronism from another age and, because it is operated by an organisation that likes to style itself as the game's governing body, a serious stain on golf's efforts to shed its old-fashioned image. The R&amp;A has never taken much notice of such critics, although it might have more difficulty in ignoring this latest condemnation given that it has come from Scotland's most senior politician, Alex Salmond. \"The Royal and Ancient Golf Club should follow their long-standing practice of offering membership to the Principal of St Andrews University and I am sure that after due consideration they will continue with that honourable tradition,\" the first Minister said today. It is highly unusual for a politician of Salmond's seniority to become embroiled in the affairs of a sporting club but the politician is also a keen golfer who has long taken an interest in the health of the sport. He was joined in his criticism by Claire Baker, a Labour member of the Scottish parliament, who said Dr Richardson should be accorded the same courtesy and privileges as her male predecessors. \"It's more than 500 years since Mary Queen of Scots became the first woman to tee off at the home of golf but it seems that the Royal and Ancient is still stuck in the middle ages. It is high time the fuddy-duddies who run the club put their chauvinist attitudes to one side and joined the 21st century,\" she said tonight. The R&amp;A allowed competitors in the 2007 women's British Open at St Andrews to use the facilities in its clubhouse, which sits behind the first tee of the Old Course. But given its past record and the feelings of the majority of its members it is unlikely to be in a hurry to take the more significant step of having a woman member. A spokesman for the club said extending honorary membership to the principal of St Andrews was not a tradition or a right. \"It has only happened twice in the past. It's an invitation at the club's discretion,\" he said. \"I think it is important to point out it is only ever issued after the principal of the day has had the opportunity to become well-known locally.\" Tradition or otherwise, the R&amp;A has developed a habit of ignoring history, even its own, when it wants to. The club had a long tradition of giving membership to the president of its American counterpart, the US Golf Association \u2014 a policy which ended when the USGA appointed its first woman president, Judy Bell, in the mid-1990s. The R&amp;A did not grant Bell membership. It gave her a broach instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
