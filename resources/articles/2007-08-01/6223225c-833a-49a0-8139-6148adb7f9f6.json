Delicious, but, well, starchy. The recipe is based loosely on the masala dosa found in Indian street markets - but unless you feel like making your own dosa (pancakes made from a lentil and rice batter) then a naan makes a perfect substitute. And if you want something lighter, try using a chapatti or a pitta bread. This recipe can be made at any time in the week, but there's something nice about the taste of leftover potatoes from a Sunday roast, particularly if it saves them from being wasted. But be warned - this dish is extremely filling. It's not an advisable lunch option if you've got a hectic afternoon, as it tends to bring on an enjoyable stupor of digestion - which strangely seems to fit Monday afternoons especially well. Bombay Potatoes Naan 250g boiled or roast potatoes chopped to half cm dice 1 beef tomato deseeded and chopped 1 spring onion thinly sliced Fresh coriander and mint finely chopped (quantity depends on personal choice) Half a small onion, finely chopped One naan bread Curry powder 25ml chicken or vegetable stock Vegetable oil Butter Place the chopped onion in a frying pan with a little vegetable oil and cook on a medium heat without colouring until soft. Then add the diced tomatoes. When the tomatoes have started to loosen, add the curry powder, stock and butter and cook down until a loose paste consistency is formed. Then add your diced potatoes and cook for a few more minutes while stirring until all the ingredients come together. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and leave to cool. When cold add the chopped spring onion and herbs. Place naan bread on the counter and smear the mixture all over one side. Then roll the bread into a sausage to create a Swiss Roll effect. Wrap in greaseproof paper and transfer to a lunchbox. The sandwich is best served at room temperature or slightly warm.
