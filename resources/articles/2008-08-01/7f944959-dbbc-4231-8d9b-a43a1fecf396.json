Her first boyfriend at Cambridge requested she leave university to marry him and become a receptionist. She ditched him and, after a galvanising stint on Woman's Own, joined The Observer, where she dispensed her sparky satire on careers and having it all for 36 years. This lively autobiography is a joy to read, skipping along in Whitehorn's jolly-hockey-sticks tone, where things are either 'super' or 'grotty' and everyone is 'great buddies'. The usual journalism anecdotes abound, alongside tales of not-quite domestic bliss with late husband Gavin Lyall and sons Bernard and Jake. Now aged 80 and still writing, Whitehorn is as relevant and witty as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
