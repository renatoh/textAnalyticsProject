That is how Kyle Edmund views it before his first-round match on Tuesday against the Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who missed the Games in Brazil with a back injury. \u201cWhen I found out that I was in on my ranking after people pulled out, I was over the moon,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cI see the Olympics as really the pinnacle of sport. I really enjoyed it, being inside the village, meeting other athletes. We were across the hall from the golfers, who were staying [in the same apartment block]. We chatted to the boxing people, the rugby people. Throughout the year you\u2019re surrounded just by the tennis players, so it was nice to meet Justin Rose and Danny Willett, because they\u2019re two major champions. \u201cWhen you\u2019re away from the courts, at the village, that\u2019s where you really felt the Olympic atmosphere. And the opening ceremony was something I was pleased I did. I wasn\u2019t going to go to it but then I thought I\u2019d regret it.\u201d Andy Murray, who carried the flag for the Great Britain team, cashed in on the spirit there with a second gold and said later: \u201cI need to try and keep that [momentum] going and the US Open is always the next big goal.\u201d He will be as tired as anyone at the last major championship of the season, probably more so than many, given he has played in all three finals and reaches the concluding weekend of nearly every tournament in which he plays. They are all suffering a little, though, as Edmund pointed out: \u201cIt\u2019s the same for everybody. The tennis year is a long year. It feels longer because the back end of last year stretched out with the Davis Cup final.\u201d Heather Watson, who dipped out in the Olympic singles and doubles with Johanna Konta, had a last-minute reprieve in the mixed doubles with Murray, a memory that will stay with her. \u201cI had my bags packed [watching Murray in the singles] and was going to leave for the airport in 15 minutes, then a team dropped out. I had no idea until 30 minutes before we went on court. It was so close. It was a tough situation. I didn\u2019t even see Andy until we walked on court.\u201d The former British No1, who plays the Dutch qualifier Rich\u00e8l Hogenkamp on Tuesday, said: \u201cI loved it, glad I went to the opening ceremony.\u201d Konta became genuinely animated recalling her Olympic experience. \u201cJustin [Rose] said to me: \u2018You\u2019ve been having such a good year,\u2019 and I thought: \u201cMy God, he knows who I am!\u2019 I had a couple of those moments, surprised that people know the sport I play to begin with. I was definitely one of the more social ones. We were sitting with the boxers, the rugby players, with the hockey players. I\u2019m glad I did. I wanted to understand boxing better. We had the British School set up for us. Team GB were so well kitted, we looked so good. I thought we were the best put together. It made me very proud. I hadn\u2019t been in a uniform for a long time.\u201d For Murray and his brother Jamie, Dominic Inglot, Konta, Edmund and Watson there was never any question of joining the dissenters. For Dan Evans it was slightly different. He could have gone as a late replacement but chose not to, as he explained while preparing for his opener against Rajeev Ram on Tuesday. Did he regret not going? \u201cNot one bit,\u201d he said, without hesitation. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have won more than one match there, or two matches, so it was a pointless exercise for me. I like playing for my country but, if I\u2019d done the Olympics and then was around 140 in the rankings next year, I would have been kicking myself. That was the only reason. I just needed to play matches. \u201cI pulled out of Team Tennis in this country as well to play the tournaments. It was a good chance to make some points and I did in the end. The Olympics is obviously an amazing spectacle but it was one of them I just had to watch on TV. I watched some of Andy\u2019s matches, some of the other events, but not massively.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
