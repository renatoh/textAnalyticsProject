Aren't all presenters on TV, male or female, chosen at some level for their sex appeal? I have no idea if Anna Ford is retiring gracefully or has been pushed out by BBC bosses to make way for younger newsreading totty but a 28-year career seems a remarkably long one to me. And isn't the real story that Sophie Raworth has been kicked off the Six to make way for Natasha Kaplinsky? SteveDixonFan \u00b7 Of course TV is ageist against female presenters. Why else is Bruce Forsyth still on primetime TV, but instead of Rosemary Ford, his copresenter is the much younger Tess Daly? Kay \u00b7 The older woman is the TV face of the future! The older the better I say! The two greatest women on TV are Lindsey Hilsum, Channel 4 News' diplomatic editor, and Judy Finnigan. They just get better and better as each year goes by. I look forward to watching them when they are 90. Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4 head of news and current affairs \u00b7 I think the cult of youth and beauty on British TV news has peaked. When we launched Five News in 1997, Kirsty Young had just turned 30. It was a conscious decision to have a young female in a news culture dominated by middle-aged men. In the wake of her appointment I think there was a fashion for younger news presenters and reporters but that seems to have run its course. Actually the most loved and respected newsreaders are generally the ones who've been doing it for longest. Jon Snow's reputation is unassailable. On my own channel we recently brought John Suchet out of retirement while Kirsty was on maternity leave. It feels right for Five and the early audience response has been very positive I would say British TV is rather keen on veterans - Noel Edmonds, John Suchet, even Bruce Forsyth are back on the box and doing great stuff. Chris Shaw, senior programme controller, news and current affairs, Five \u00b7 You've just backed up Ruby's complaint - older men may be acceptable, but not older women. Duffer \u00b7 I don't think British TV does too badly. I live in Belgium and here almost all the women on TV are ex-Miss Belgiums and not an ounce of talent between them. Sara \u00b7 Your article talks about a return to the 50s in terms of attitudes. I seem to recall that the number of female news presenters on TV in the 50s was zero. Ditto the 60s and half the 70s, until along came Angela Rippon and, shortly afterwards ... Anna Ford. Ian Pring \u00b7 Erm - Anna Ford is two years past retirement age [she's 62]. It's not ageist to allow people to retire. Oli \u00b7 Sexist? Ageist? I say good. We pay a lot of money for our TV licences and so if we have to pay their inflated salaries we should at least expect the presenters to be easy on the eyes. I'm annoyed about this whole sexism/agesim/sizeism whinge - young, slim, attractive people should be on TV. After all, that is what most people want. Joe Bloggs \u00b7 I work in media and I can tell you now that attractiveness is definitely a factor for females. It's worrying to have to think that your career goes down the tubes when your looks do - esepcially if your looks have no bearing on your ability to do your job - 'cos there's nothing you can do about getting old. Folly Dolly \u00b7 And the government wants people to work until 70 or thereabouts! What are \"too old\" female presenters, producers, researchers etc. to do when they leave? Jane \u00b7 Does anyone remember Live TV? They had a midget on a trampoline reading the news. He was far superior to anything the BBC have managed. Then again, we live in a very sizeist culture. CatB \u00b7 It's TV, not radio. If you haven't got the most viewer-friendly look combined with hosting talent - it's quite right that you're shipped off! Why is the aesthetic regard treated as less important? tv blokey \u00b7 I don't think the BBC can be included in the attack. Every female journalist in the Beeb who gets on the screen deserves to be there on merit, experience and sheer hard work. Rebecca \u00b7 When people retire they are, by definition, replaced by someone younger. quarsan \u00b7 It's not the TV that's ageist and sexist, it's the audience. TV just gives them more of what they want. When TV execs decide to give the audience what they think is good for them instead, you end up with something like BBC4 and nobody watches.
