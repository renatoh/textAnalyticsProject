In a bid to stop irresponsible lending, a major package of proposals, set out by consumer minister Melanie Johnson, will muzzle loan sharks and magnify the small print. The proposals include: a review of the 30-year-old consumer credit act; and giving the courts and the office of fair trading (OFT) extra powers to clamp down on loan sharks who prey on vulnerable people. Increasing protection for some of the most vulnerable consumers, said to number about one million people, will mean the OFT can issue hefty fines against rogue consumer credit licence holders, as well as revoke their licences. It will be made easier for courts to examine unfair credit agreements and enable them to challenge cases brought by lenders for repossession of the borrower's home where the loan costs seem very high. Ms Johnson also unveiled a report by the debt taskforce which calls for clearer and more understandable credit agreements. It also suggests ways of achieving more responsible lending and borrowing. \"Our credit laws are 30 years' old and need a radical overhaul to protect people in today's credit market. This is a top priority for the government,\" Ms Johnson said. \"There has been a worrying increase in the numbers of people falling into the debt trap, getting loans at often extortionate rates which they clearly can't afford to repay. \"Consumers need to know what they are letting themselves in for when they sign up for credit. The expensive catch shouldn't be hidden in microscopic text. It should be explained up front by the lender. \"We will take action to protect vulnerable consumers who are preyed on by rogue lenders and make sure consumers get clear and understandable information so they know exactly what they are getting into before they sign on the dotted line,\" she added. Other proposals include putting a stop to irresponsible lending, with lenders looking at whether their prospective borrower is already over-committed. This will protect the most vulnerable consumers who are exploited by rogue lenders. Rules penalising people who want to settle their loans early will also be changed. Currently, people face tough penalties if they want to pay off their loan early. If someone wants to settle a 25-year \u00a325,000 loan after only 10 years they could be subject to more than \u00a311,000 penalty. But the government plans to change the so-called \"Rule of 78\" which it feels is biased towards the lender and make it easier for borrowers to switch to better loan deals. The financial limit of loans protected by the consumer credit act will also be increased, with most loans up to \u00a325,000 now being protected with cooling-off periods, default procedures and rights of withdrawal. And the interest-free credit deal sting will also be addressed to stop consumers being hit with crippling backdated interest and a high annual premium rate if they miss their final payment by one day after the interest-free period. In future, borrowers will have to be notified in advance of their final payment date and be given breathing space to settle the loan. Consumers will also get access to cheaper, more competitive loans with the introduction of online credit agreements. The transparency of loan information will be improved, with the government seeking to magnify the small print attached to agreements to prevent people from being misled, helping them find good deals with no hidden snags. David Harker, chief executive of the national association of citizens advice bureaux welcomed the proposals. \"CAB advisers have seen a huge increase in the number of consumer debt enquiries, which have gone up by 39% over the past four years. \"The consumer credit act is long overdue for reform. We want to see tougher powers to clamp down on loan sharks and measures to ensure that all lenders act responsibly and fairly towards consumers,\" he said. Citizens advice bureaux dealt with about one million enquiries about debts in 2000/01. More than 600,000 of those enquiries related to consumer debts - including loans, credit cards and overdrafts. The taskforce on over-indebtedness was set up in October 2000 and focused on practical ways of achieving more responsible lending and borrowing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
