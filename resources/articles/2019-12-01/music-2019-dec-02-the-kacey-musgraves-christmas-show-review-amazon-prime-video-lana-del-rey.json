Now, she\u2019s back to carve out more of the holiday pie with an Amazon Prime Video special and an accompanying soundtrack that makes Mariah Carey\u2019s Merriest Christmas on Netflix seem edgy by comparison. The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show revels in old-fashioned seasonal kitsch as familiar as the old woolly jumper that comes out of your wardrobe every December. (Savvy viewers will also question whether the doll\u2019s house-style setting was inspired by Taylor Swift\u2019s video for Lover.) The schmalz is very much intentional and the special zips along thanks to its tight running time \u2013 just under 45 minutes \u2013 and sardonic narration by Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2019s Dan Levy. It\u2019s the music that falls flat. Anyone tempted to spin the soundtrack on the strength of Musgraves\u2019s excellent 2018 album Golden Hour is in for disappointment. Her new takes on Christmas standards have zero fresh ideas bar occasional twangy guitars, as if added to assert her country bona fides. Other numbers are little more than skits \u2013 such as the Musgraves-James Cordon duet of Let It Snow \u2013 though the blockbuster Lana Del Rey team-up I\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas finds both singers in good voice as they whisper over acoustic plucks. Three of the four Musgraves compositions from A Very Kacey Christmas are performed with varying success: Ribbons and Bows features a similar drum and horn pattern as Swift\u2019s Shake It Off, but lacks the same oomph. The best track of the set is Musgraves\u2019s Christmas Makes Me Cry, a raw ballad and one of the few songs that acknowledges that the holiday season is often difficult for people. The star feels the void of missing loved ones and the pain of a heart still broken. \u201cAnd they always say, \u2018Have a happy holiday\u2019 / And every year, I sincerely try,\u201d she sings tenderly. The song is a brief shot of soul in a breezy special that will be fine as background TV on Christmas night. As for most of the soundtrack, Musgraves gives little reason to replace the classics on your Christmas playlist with her new versions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
