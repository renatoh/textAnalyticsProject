Today's vote was 61-36, one more than the 60 needed to advance the measure toward Senate passage tomorrow. That in turn, will set the stage for possibly contentious negotiations with the House of Representatives on a final compromise on legislation the president says is needed desperately to tackle the worst economic crisis in more than a generation. The Senate vote occurred as the Obama administration moved ahead on another major component of its economic recovery plan. Officials said US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner would outline rules tomorrow for $350bn in bail-out funds designed to help the financial industry as well as homeowners facing foreclosure. Today's vote was close but scarcely in doubt once the White House and Democratic leaders agreed to trim about $100bn on Friday. As a result, Republican senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of the north-eastern state of Maine, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania broke ranks to cast their votes to advance the bill. Democratic senator Edward M Kennedy, battling a brain tumour, made his first appearance in the Capitol since suffering a seizure on Obama's inauguration day, and he joined all other Democrats in support of the measure. \"There is no reason we can't do this by the end of the week,\" said Senator Harry Reid, the chamber's lead Democrat. He said he was prepared to hold the Senate in session into the Presidents Day bank holiday weekend if necessary and cautioned Republicans not to try and delay final progress. He said passage would mark \"the first step on the long road to recovery\". Moments before the vote, the Congressional Budget Office issued a new estimate that put the cost at $838bn, an increase from the $827bn figure from last week. \"This bill has the votes to pass. We know that,\" conceded Senator John Thune, a Republican who has spoken daily in the Senate against the legislation. As if to underscore its prospects for passage, the US Chamber of Commerce, a prominent and powerful business group that often supports the Republicans' conservative financial policies, issued a statement calling on the Senate to advance the bill. Even so, in the hours before today's vote, Republican opponents attacked it as too costly and unlikely to have the desired effect on the economy. \"This is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill,\" said Republican senator Lamar Alexander. All 36 votes in opposition were cast by Republicans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
