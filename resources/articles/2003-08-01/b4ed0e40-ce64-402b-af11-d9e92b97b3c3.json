The government's director of communications, cross examined for a further two and a quarter hours this afternoon, said the dead government scientist could then have been offered \"all proper support\". Instead, Mr Campbell said that - against his own initial opinion - the prime minister's advice was followed and the MoD was left to reveal his name as it saw fit. Among other revelations from this afternoon's session, the No 10 spin doctor said that the Labour MP Clive Soley had rung him up offering to get more \"active\" in criticising the BBC and its reporter Andrew Gilligan. He also attacked the BBC's reporting for \"moving the goalposts\" in not properly acknowledging that the foreign affairs select committee (FAC) had cleared him of inserting the 45-minute allegation. And he accused the FAC and the separate, closed intelligence and security committee of having a \"turf war\" over their investigations into the case for the Iraq war, and fingered Conservative MPs on the FAC for refusing to believe him, no matter what evidence he gave. But he declared himself pleased that he had \"opened up a flank\" on the BBC with his attack on them during his testimony to the committee. He admitted that he agreed to appear before the FAC, after initially refusing to do so, because it was clear that the committee was \"heading in a very, very bad way for the government\". Under sustained pressure from Lord Hutton, who suggested that either the government should have \"battened down the hatches\" and refused to comment on Dr Kelly's identity, or released his name so that the TV and radio could interview him, Mr Campbell defended the government's course of action. After a long pause, he said Dr Kelly's identity would have always emerged. He said: \"I think we could have done [what you suggested] but I think it would still have come out with all the media pressure and other pressures you referred to. Lord Hutton then intervened, asking: \"What was your view about the desirability of the name of the source [Dr Kelly] coming out into the public domain?\" Mr Campbell said: \"I felt at that stage it was inevitable and as I have said earlier, possibly the only way we were going to be able to establish in the public and parliamentary mind that the Today allegations were false. \"From my perspective, it will have been a good thing but I emphasise that I did not do anything to bring it about.\" Mr Campbell said the government would have been accused of a cover-up if they had not named the weapons inspector. However, he said that - against his initial advice - Mr Blair had wanted leave it to the MoD and its permanent secretary Sir Kevin Tebbit to deal with Dr Kelly's identity, even if that risked his name coming out through a leak, or the accusation of a cover-up. Mr Campbell said he disagreed with this policy at the time, but thought in retrospect it was correct. But he said of the strategy: \"I understand how strategies get drawn up in difficult and fast-moving situations but with hindsight it would have been better done differently.\" Mr Campbell also said it was Mr Blair's view at the time that the private ISC was a \"better committee to look into this.\" He also said the government were not entirely sure what Dr Kelly was going to say. \"That's why the government did not want to put him before public scrutiny,\" he said - although it finally did want him to appear before the FAC. Mr Campbell agreed with Lord Hutton's QC that he regarded the FAC as a \"referee\" between the government and the BBC over the Iraq dossiers row, but complained that - through his journalistic and Labour party sources - he discovered that \"Tory MPs say they won't endorse anything that exonerated me in relation to the 45 minutes\". He also complained that after the split-vote FAC report was issued, clearing him, the BBC \"moved the goalposts\" by concentrating their reporting on its criticisms of the February \"dodgy\" dossier, and the Labour-run nature of the FAC itself. Reading from his diary- which was not shown to the court - the Downing Street spin doctor also revealed that Clive Soley, the chair of the parliamentary Labour party, had rung him on June 26 saying he \"wanted to get more active in this\", and suggested he go public with a suggestion that the source - at this point unknown - be interviewed privately by FAC chair Donald Anderson, so that, if necessary, Andrew Gilligan could be recalled. This would appear to hint at concentrated party-political efforts to boost Mr Campbell's war with the BBC. There was another blow for the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, when Mr Campbell - again quoting from his diaries - revealed that Mr Hoon had rung him ahead of the FAC report's publication to discuss the \"source issue\", minded to be \"severe\" but offering the whistle blower \"some kind of plea bargain\". Mr Campbell said he had been reluctant to disclose the term \"plea bargain\" because it misrepresented Mr Hoon's position as offering to \"do a deal - and that was not the case\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
