Victory would give South Africa their first Tri-Nations title since 1998 and end a run of five successive third-place finishes. But if they lose, they will again finish bottom and Australia will be champions. At the start of the year the Boks were the basket case of world rugby; bad on the field and mad off it, judging by their moribund World Cup performance and pre-tournament nudist training camp. But the new coach Jake White has banished those memories. The Springboks' graph has been rising sharply and following last week's 40-26 victory over the All Blacks in Johannesburg, the home side go into this Tri-Nations decider as narrow favourites. White's achievement has been to bring the right players together in the right atmosphere. \"Jake has picked a great bunch of guys in terms of ability and character,\" said the captain John Smit. \"He basically gave the guys the ammunition to fight wars.\" Meanwhile the Wallabies have spent the week waiting for a predicted (but unrealised) \"hate the Wallabies\" campaign. \"You have thousands of people screaming for South Africa seven metres from the field,\" said their coach Eddie Jones. \"It's a big challenge for us.\" South Africa: Montgomery; Paulse, Joubert, Barry, De Villiers; Van der Westhuyzen, Conradie; Du Randt, Smit (capt), Andrews, Botha, Matfield, Burger, Venter, Van Niekerk. Australia: Latham; Rathbone, Mortlock, Matt Giteau, Tuqiri; Larkham, Gregan (capt); Young, Cannon, Baxter, Harrison, Sharpe, Smith, Waugh, Lyons.
