A slump in Newcastle's share price on Tuesday afternoon forced the club to act. Yesterday was act two, with Robson and Shepherd sat side by side. It amounted to a vote of confidence from Shepherd but if Robson saw the negative inherent in that he did not show it. \"I've never jumped ship in my life,\" said Robson, who first took a job in management in 1968 with Fulham. \"I've never wanted to not fight the good fight, ever, and I've been in football for well over 50 years as a player and manager. \"It's never been in my head, never been in my thoughts. When I heard about it yesterday afternoon I was absolutely flabbergasted, I was astounded. I just laughed. I thought it was outrageous, it was ridiculous. Where did it come from? The spin is tremendous. It goes all over the world in about one minute. It was just an horrendous accusation.\" The most obvious reason would be Newcastle's poor start to the domestic season and their qualifying round elimination from the Champions League by Partizan Belgrade. Newcastle are yet to win in the Premiership this season and are second bottom, one point above Wolves. The team are yet to display the coherence and confidence which lifted them to third last season and, since the start of April, Newcastle have won only two of 13 Premiership matches. One of those was against Sunderland. There is, moreover, the accusation that Robson, aged 70, has difficulty handling the group of young players at the club. Kieron Dyer, Craig Bellamy, Carl Cort and Andy Griffin have caused Robson headaches with some of their behaviour off the pitch and adding Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate to the squad caused consternation in some quarters on Tyneside. There is a young/old divide in the dressing room but its significance can be over-estimated. Robson, speaking on Sky Sports, said: \"People have just talked about Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate but they are fine boys. \"Before you sit an exam you do your homework and we did that on the two boys. They have lived up to all our expectations. They have been fantastic pros, they have never given us an ounce of trouble. Yes, we have a stack of young kids in the club but they're alive and alert and they keep my mind going. They are fine. There are no dressing room divisions at all. \"The morale in the club, the team spirit, is at a very high level and we have no problems. You could see that in our performance at Arsenal the other night.\" But Newcastle lost nevertheless and there can be little doubt that Robson is examining how the club captain, Alan Shearer, will be replaced eventually. It has been claimed that Robson had contemplated omitting Shearer recently while a Sunday newspaper story over a month ago that Robson was prepared to sell Shearer to Liverpool was denied vociferously. Most of all, however, it is results which prompted this week's minor eruption. Southampton and Kevin Phillips arrive at St James' Park on Saturday and Shepherd may find yesterday's proximity to Robson less beguiling should Newcastle lose and the supporters react badly. \"It's never been in question,\" Shepherd said of Robson's position yesterday. \"We've got to remember we've four ingredients that a lot of other clubs wished they had. We've got the support, which is the best, we've got the ground, which is the best in my opinion, and the training facilities are the best. \"That's not to forget the team, who have just finished third. They are still great players. We like every one of them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
