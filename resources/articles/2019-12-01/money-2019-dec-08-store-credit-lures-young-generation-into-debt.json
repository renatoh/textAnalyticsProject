But then came \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d credit, which meant families could buy in store and spread payments over a few years. These loans soon gained a bad reputation and shrank away, but did not vanish. Now they have re-emerged, rebranded and aimed at a technologically aware generation of shopper \u2013 while also being blamed in part for the mushrooming debt that UK consumers are drowning in. \u201cThe rise of \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 retailing is of great concern, as more people are being enticed into high-cost debt that they may struggle to repay,\u201d said Ros Altmann, the campaigner and former pensions minister. \u201cFinancial resilience across the population is weakening, debt levels are rising and if too many customers are unable to repay their debts in future, we could see a repeat of the financial crisis.\u201d Where did they come from? Previously known as shop credit or interest-free deals, this type of credit has been around for years, giving interest-free periods during which consumers could repay loans, but charging interest after that period. The idea was to make big-ticket items affordable. While most people would think they could pay off the money in the interest-free period, life frequently got in the way and they ended up paying interest. Now the loans are back, and they\u2019re far more widespread, both in stores and online. But they are rarely marketed under the buy now, pay later banner; consumers are more likely to be told that they can make \u201clifestyle\u201d choices and remain in control of how they pay. \u201cThey\u2019re high-interest loans in drag. Don\u2019t be fooled. Many loans don\u2019t even mention that they\u2019re a form of credit. It\u2019s \u2018different ways to pay\u2019,\u201d said Martyn James from complaints website Resolver. In October, Marks &amp; Spencer was the latest retailer to announce a buy now, pay later service on its website to attract customers and boost pre-Christmas trade. How does it work now? Previously, people would have many months or even years to pay back their loan. In some cases now, that can be 30 days and for much smaller amounts. So if someone takes out a series of little loans they can quickly lose track of how much they owe and when they have to repay it, risk running up interest payments. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced new rules earlier this year to deal with one of the most controversial elements of the credit \u2013 charging interest on the whole sum, which meant consumers could pay interest on the full amount borrowed even if they had paid off part of it. This meant that if there was \u00a3200 left on a deal where \u00a31,000 of goods were bought with a 40% rate, the person did not pay \u00a380 interest but \u00a3400. The new FCA rules mean firms can no longer charge on the whole amount borrowed, only the parts outstanding. The pitfalls Problems start are when people take out multiple loans and get confused about what to pay when. It is also, says James, easy to \u201csleepwalk\u201d into these types of credit as they don\u2019t feel like loans. This is especially the case online where a box can be ticked to say that terms have been read. The advance of technology has meant that consumers can be approved for loans much quicker than before, which results in them being able to get credit while they are in store. \u201cIn the weeks before Christmas, [using buy now, pay later] can be very seductive. But it stops feeling like \u2018real money\u2019, and you have to be very disciplined not to spend more than you really wanted to. It can be too easy to accumulate an amount of debt you can\u2019t pay in the few weeks and months allowed before interest is added,\u201d said Sara Williams of Debt Camel, a blog advising on money problems. A trap for the young Because of the speed with which this kind of credit has spread, concern has been raised at how younger generations are being affected, especially as many of the retailers selling \u201cfast fashion\u201d now offer credit options. Some shoppers have found themselves in debt as a result of not returning goods on time. Eileen Adamson, founder of financial coaching site Your Money Sorted, says it promotes poor financial decision making, which can lead on to problems in later life. \u201cMany of these transactions are for relatively small amounts, meaning that we don\u2019t give them much thought, before purchasing. Imagine delaying payment for five purchases of \u00a330, leaving you owing \u00a3150. These small purchases are easy to \u2018forget\u2019 and each time you look at your bank account, you could think you are \u00a3150 better off than you actually are,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can then lead to spending more money, because you feel flush. If this pattern is repeated regularly, then before long you will find yourself being unable to afford the repayments. It\u2019s just too easy to spend more than you can afford, especially when the companies actively encourage you to buy multiple items, and return them if they don\u2019t suit. We all know that this is just another way of encouraging us to buy more, and thereby increase their profits.\u201d A worsening problem Last week it emerged that UK household debt levels had risen again. Non-mortgage debt jumped by 11%, meaning that the average household owes \u00a39,400. One of the reasons for the rising debt problem was that people were being offered easy but expensive credit, Altmann said. \u201cI would like to see regulators insisting on cooling-off periods and checks before customers are allowed to take on debts. The risk of another economic crisis, caused by irresponsible lending, is rising and regulators should take this seriously.\u201d Ever-expanding credit The website Resolver has received almost 7,500 complaints about \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d-style deals in the past year. In one case, a woman from Scotland had opened an account with one of the major retailers and was offered ever-expanding credit limits. However, she became confused and did not grasp when she had to pay for the items she had bought, and her bill soon stood at more than \u00a32,000 even though she did not have a job and was struggling to make payments. With late-payment fees and interest, the amount she owed was soon much more than she had spent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
