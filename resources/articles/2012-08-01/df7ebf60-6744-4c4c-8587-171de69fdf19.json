Nine of the ten worst performing hospital trusts for cancer care are in the capital, according to a league table which rates the performance of 160 trusts across England and is drawn up by Macmillan Cancer Support. The rankings are based on the charity's assessment of detailed feedback provided to the Department of Health by 71,793 patients who were treated at 160 trusts in late 2011. They have raised new concern about how patients undergoing treatment at many London hospitals are looked after. When Macmillan conducted a similar exercise early last year the capital occupied eight of the bottom 10 positions on the tables but, despite pledges of action the situation has got worse. The league table reveals a north-south divide in cancer care in England with hospitals in Yorkshire, the North-East, Derbyshire and North-West occupying eight of the top ten rankings. \"London is a bit of a black hole in terms of patient experience of cancer care. It's a major worry. While in London there are some excellent clinicians and some of the best treatment in the NHS can be found there, London trusts consistently under-perform compared to the rest of the country,\" said Steve Richards, Macmillan's director for England. Richards rejected arguments made by some in the NHS in the capital that \"the London effect\" \u2013 hospitals' high turnover of staff, the ethnically diverse population and the state of some NHS facilities \u2013 explained the differences. Birmingham and Manchester faced similar challenges but still provided care that patients rated highly. \"London needs to work harder to improve the experience patients have of their care,\" he added. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs five hospitals in west London, is named by Macmillan as the worst performer of the 160 trusts in the second survey. This was based on what patients who completed the DH's Cancer Patient Experience Survey 2011-12 felt. It featured in the bottom 20% of the 160 trusts and in 56 of the 64 questions patients were asked. The trust, which is the largest in the NHS, admitted that it had let some cancer patients down and said it had initiated improvements. \"We acknowledge that the experience of some of our cancer patients was below the standard we strive to deliver, when this survey was completed between September and November last year,\" said a trust spokeswoman. She said staff working with cancer patients now receive customer service training, patients are offered devices on which to rate the quality of their care and specialist cancer nurses are spending more time with patients as part of the changes. David Stout, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said they should \"listen carefully\" to patient feedback when it proved negative. London hospitals' low rankings needed more exploration but could be due to the fact that \"financial problems faced by the NHS are biting particularly hard in London\", he added. Paul Burstow, care services minister, said: \"We want everyone to receive good quality care. That is why we expect all trusts to look at how they compare with others across all the different survey areas, and to target their efforts on bringing themselves up to the standards of the best. I would like to congratulate the best performing trusts on their success. \"However, there is always room for improvement, and they must now look to see how they can strive to do even better,\" he added.
