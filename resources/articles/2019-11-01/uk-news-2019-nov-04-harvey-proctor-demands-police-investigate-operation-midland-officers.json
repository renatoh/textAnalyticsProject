Proctor spoke out after a damning report last month laid bare a series of failings in the \u00a32.5m Metropolitan police investigation into the allegations. The report revealed officers unlawfully obtained warrants to search the homes of Proctor and other falsely accused men. The ex-politician has submitted a criminal complaint about five officers involved in the inquiry into the claims of Carl Beech \u2013 known as \u201cNick\u201d when he first came forward in 2014 \u2013 who was jailed for 18 years in July over the false allegations. Proctor wants the officers to be investigated and interviewed under caution. They include Steve Rodhouse, who was a deputy assistant commissioner and the gold commander of the investigation and is now the deputy director general of the National Crime Agency, Britain\u2019s version of the FBI. The other four, who have all retired from the Met, are Kenny McDonald, Eric Sword, Alison Hepworth and Diane Tudway. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog earlier cleared officers involved in Operation Midland of wrongdoing, but Proctor is accusing the five of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office. The 72-year-old told a press conference in Westminster that he had made a formal complaint about the five officers. \u201cIt is unprecedented that two senior and respected judges should publicly allege criminality in the conduct of a police investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI waited for the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] and the IOPC to take the necessary action to trigger a full police investigation into this alleged criminality. In the absence of such action and investigation, after the fullest and most careful consideration, having taken legal advice, and with the deepest regret, I am compelled, in the interest of justice, to report these matters as crimes to Northumbria police.\u201d The force, he said, should not limit its investigation to the five officers and should \u201cgo where the evidence takes them\u201d. Sir Richard Henriques, the retired high court judge who carried out a review of Operation Midland, last month called for a criminal investigation, saying: \u201cThe course of justice was perverted with shocking consequences.\u201d His report revealed that warrants to search the homes of wrongly accused suspects were obtained \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cshould not have taken place\u201d. It said police \u201cmisled\u201d the district judge who authorised the search by describing Beech\u2019s allegations as \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. The district judge Howard Riddle, who granted the search warrants, agreed with Henriques\u2019s finding. \u201cThe conclusion is that the search warrants were obtained unlawfully,\u201d Riddle said last month. Northumbria police confirmed they had received Proctor\u2019s complaint, which he delivered in person last month, and had referred it to the Metropolitan police. Scotland Yard said it was assessing the complaint, adding: \u201cWe can confirm that the MPS received a referral from Northumbria police on Thursday 31 October 2019 following a complaint comprising criminal allegations in relation to five former MPS officers involved in Operation Midland.\u201d Last month, the Met published an unredacted version of Henriques\u2019s scathing review of Operation Midland which listed a series of police failings and prompted calls for the commissioner, Cressida Dick, to consider her position. Henriques revealed that senior officers agreed to publicly say they believed Beech, leading a detective to infamously declare that his claims were \u201ccredible and true\u201d. The premeditated decision by officers to publicly say they believed Beech was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d, Henriques said. The unredacted report also shed light on the role of Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who, according to Henriques, pressurised investigating officers. Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among \u201cinvestigative priorities\u201d by a senior officer. Beech, a former nurse, alleged he was among the victims of an \u201cestablishment group\u201d \u2013 including politicians and military figures \u2013 who kidnapped, raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 1980s. He accused Proctor, the former prime minister Edward Heath, the ex-home secretary Leon Brittan and the D-day veteran Field Marshal Edwin Bramall of being abusers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
