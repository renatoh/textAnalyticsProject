An Old Bailey jury took three hours to find Thomas Hughes guilty of the murder of Krystal Hart, 22, on Good Friday last year. There were cheers from the public gallery as the verdict was delivered. The judge, Anthony Morris, said Hughes must serve a minimum term of 30 years. Hughes, 41, of Stonells Road, Battersea, south London, had denied the shooting, saying another man was responsible. But parts of the incident, including the sound of two shots and Hughes hurrying away, were caught on CCTV. Hart died instantly after being shot through the head. A second bullet was fired into her temple after she collapsed in her doorway. The prosecution said Hart was executed by the petty criminal and drug dealer in an act of revenge after her boyfriend, David Siveter, had written down Hughes's car registration earlier that day. Hart was two months pregnant and had recently given up her job as a temporary secretary in the parliamentary office of the then deputy prime minister, John Prescott. She had lived in an upstairs housing association flat in Belleville Road, Battersea, for a year. A few months after moving in with her mother Debbie Penfold, she clashed with her downstairs neighbour Angie Brewer, 53. The two women were involved in an ongoing county court action, and the CCTV was installed to provide evidence. Brewer was blamed for causing most of the trouble, and was due to be given an asbo. Hart's pregnancy was not known to Brewer or Hughes. Brewer, who was said to complain regularly to the authorities, was friendly with Hughes, a loner who lived nearby in a dilapidated house with his wheelchair-bound 81-year-old mother. The prosecution said he was infatuated with Brewer, but he told the court he thought of her as a big sister. Hughes had kept out of the dispute until witnessing a confrontation between Brewer and Hart's boyfriend in April, when Siveter wrote down his registration number. Brewer called the police and then telephoned Hughes, who returned with a gun looking for Siveter. He banged at Hart's door, demanding that she open it, calling out: \"Come out bitch.\" Brewer, who could be heard pleading \"No\", became hysterical as shots were fired, the court was told. Aftab Jafferjee, prosecuting, said: \"This defendant did what he did precisely because of the underlying animosity and him empathising with Angie Brewer.\" Hughes had been heard telling her: \"I will do anything for you, I will cut off my arm or leg if I had to.\" Jafferjee said Brewer would have \"a huge moral responsibility\". In 1997, Hughes was jailed for 18 months for stabbing another woman in the neck with a screwdriver. He admitted causing actual bodily harm to a former friend, Angela Murphy, after a row in her car. However, he told the jury at the Hart trial that \"it was only a scratch\". After today's verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, who led the investigation, said: \"Hughes was a bit of a Walter Mitty character. He wanted to impress Angie but grossly over-reacted.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
