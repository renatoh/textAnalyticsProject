Additionally, we are specifically concerned about the British Council's apparent wholesale replacement of art with the language and aspirations of the \"creative industries\". We are not convinced that the way in which to achieve positive cultural relations and economic prosperity is through the proposed emphasis on \"market intelligence, knowledge transfer and progressive facilitation\". Innovation is not achieved through these means, but through sustained and informed support of artists and creative practitioners. The design and architecture department of the British Council has over the past 10 years developed a world-leading programme of creative, innovative and socially responsive design and architecture projects, including two of the first major international exhibitions of contemporary design to tour India and China. These interventions have not only resulted in an increase in critical debate around the role of architecture and design in shaping our lives, but have immeasurably contributed to the success of British designers and architects internationally. Critical to the success of these initiatives has been the specialist perception and knowledge within the design and architecture department. We would urge the British Council to engage in a serious debate about how to retain the knowledge and expertise built up within their specialist teams prior to any structural changes.
