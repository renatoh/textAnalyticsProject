Make that eight ...", "bodyText": "'Of course, it's famously unstageable,' one audience member loudly confided as the curtain fell on Thursday's premiere of The Seven Deadly Sins, choreographer William Tuckett's new work for the Royal Ballet. In a sense he was right, because Kurt Weill's music and Bertolt Brecht's text simply do not combine to produce engaging drama. Weill's music is smokily appealing but Brecht's sledgehammer moralising puts paid to any emotional involvement we might feel - not for nothing is this work usually presented in concert form. George Balanchine, Maurice Bejart and Kenneth MacMillan all tried at different times to wring a living, breathing ballet out of it, and their attempts are all marked Not for Resuscitation. So Tuckett was brave to take the piece on. It looks terrific, with Lez Brotherston's set a chilly montage of grey steel picked out with neon points of light, and the Louisiana departure and homecoming symbolised by a glimmering moon. The costumes are sharp and glittery too, their spare cut cleverly tailored for Tuckett's taut, expressionistic choreography. The central character in the piece is portrayed by both a singer and a dancer. Anna 1, in the role made famous by Lotte Lenya, is performed by the American chanteuse Martha Wainwright. An appealing figure beneath a Sixties bob, like a brunette Dusty Springfield, Wainright delivers Brecht's text with tremulous acidity and an oblique half-smile. Her voice hasn't got Lenya's throaty rasp - 'one octave below laryngitis,' as one listener described it - but it's full of Southern character, and Tuckett has deftly integrated her into the action so that she's not just a static version of her dancing counterpart. Anna 2, also labouring beneath complex period hair, is Zenaida Yanowsky. The story tells of a small-town girl trying to make a living amid the corruption of the big city, and encountering the titular sins on the way, and Tuckett has her twisted in every direction by the men she encounters - including Gary Avis's serpentine Director, Thiago Soares's sneering Strip Club Owner, and Edward Watson's movie-camera-toting Fernando. Brecht gives us about five minutes per sin, and the plot, episodic but essentially eventless, swiftly becomes repetitive. For all the precision of their performances, the men are cut-outs: instruments of Brecht's theories of social exploitation rather than flesh-and-blood individuals. Yanowsky, by the same token, seems to exist only to be pushed and pulled, and to wear sparkly dresses emblematic of empty celebrity. These shortcomings are built into the piece. In his 1973 version for the Royal Ballet Kenneth MacMillan tried to work round its schematic nature and to illuminate the characters by dint of sheer inventiveness, but his efforts ultimately foundered. I was in a TV version of this production, and despite MacMillan's brilliance, the thing had a doomed feel about it from the first day of rehearsals. Whatever conceit he whipped up, you couldn't avoid the dead hand of Brecht himself, moving his people around like Marxist puppets. The most frustrating thing is that Tuckett is a real talent. The Seven Deadly Sins is beautifully crafted, and its choreography is dense, tight and clever throughout. Technically, like Brotherston's sets, it gleams. And it's great to have Martha Wainwright aboard; it occurred to me mid-piece that I'd like to see Amy Winehouse in the role. But the context! A tired pastiche of a cliche, three-quarters of a century old. The problem for choreographers who learn their craft as dancers, particularly in a company as hard-worked as the Royal Ballet, is that they simply don't get exposure to other artistic currents. This is not for want of looking - they just don't have the time. In consequence they take inspiration from the work they're already involved in. Christopher Wheeldon, who danced with the Royal and New York City Ballet, produces work which is visibly drawn from Ashton and Balanchine, and Alastair Marriott's debt to MacMillan is so obvious that you can tick off the sources as you watch. And to be brutal, neither has produced a work to date which begins to compare in originality and modernity to, say, MacMillan's Danses Concertantes, made in 1955 when the choreographer was 26. It's life that makes great choreographers, not workshops. Pretty much without exception, all the interesting choreographers working today - Wayne McGregor, William Forsythe, Mark Morris - have long and convoluted CVs. They've knocked around, travelled, made their own destinies. If the Royal Ballet want choreographers of this status within their ranks, they're going to have to find the nerve to send them out into the wider world, to navigate artistic currents far from Covent Garden. And hopefully, to encounter a few deadly sins of their own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
