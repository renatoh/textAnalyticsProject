Both underdogs had their day against the giants, with Luna Rossa beating BMW Oracle. Both wins went to the teams who started better and sailed better in the 11- to 13-knot breeze. The Spanish team's Karol Jablonski nailed a penalty on the Kiwis in the pre-start and claimed the right of the course to be 14 seconds up at the first mark. After a small gain by Team New Zealand, Jablonski guided Desafio Espanol home by 1min 14sec, the first success for them in nine races between the teams. For the third time in a row Luna Rossa's James Spithill beat BMW Oracle's Chris Dickson in the start and the Italians pulled away from the American boat, protecting the lead to win by 31 seconds. Luna Rossa and Team New Zealand each lead 2-1 in the best-of-nine series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
