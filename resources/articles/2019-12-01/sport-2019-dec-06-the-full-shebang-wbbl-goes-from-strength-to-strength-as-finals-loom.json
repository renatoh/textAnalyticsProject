I was worried there wasn\u2019t going to be the kind of effort going into creating a great atmosphere to generate the crowds for festival weekends. But the competition has delivered in every way possible and I couldn\u2019t be happier to be proven wrong. The way they\u2019ve organised and structured the weekends to have plenty of fun for families with jumping castles and food trucks has been great. They\u2019ve done the full shebang and it\u2019s exactly what was needed. I think everyone involved has done a fantastic job in showing the brand of cricket the WBBL represents. While I know we\u2019ve still got finals to go this weekend, I think it\u2019s fair to say the first standalone season of the WBBL has been a big success. We\u2019ve had the most 150-plus scores in the history of the competition. Batters are the hitting the ball further, bowlers are getting faster, everyone\u2019s getting more athletic in the field. Having our own space away from the men has helped. I think having both competitions run side by side was great at the start and having a \u2018one club\u2019 philosophy really helped us come into the competition with all these people already supporting us. But with the WBBL going from strength to strength; it has been a great time to stand on our own feet and especially to say goodbye to the double headers with the men\u2019s teams. We were always pushing to cut down the time between games because families don\u2019t want to spend nine hours at the cricket \u2013 that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming to a T20 in the first place! There\u2019s not as much energy and enthusiasm if people are waiting around all day. Having the focus all on us this season has been amazing, everyone is cheering and there\u2019s entertainment left, right and centre. When we were playing double headers, we\u2019d often get people who would come early to get a good seat for the men\u2019s game, but they weren\u2019t really interested in us. Now we have big, excited crowds who have come just to see us and it\u2019s a great atmosphere in which to play cricket. One thing I\u2019d really like to see for next season is more media exposure and advertising. I only saw a few ads for the WBBL before it started, and I feel that there could be a bit more done to get media coverage of games. It\u2019s not an easy ask \u2013 women\u2019s sport in general is lacking media exposure and that\u2019s not easy to change. But I think if we want our goal to be cementing cricket as Australia\u2019s favourite sport, we can be doing more to make it happen with the promotion of the game. Before the season I started I did worry a bit about the timing and whether it was too early to be expecting people to get excited about cricket. But it\u2019s actually been really good \u2013 with not a lot of other cricket happening in Australia for most of the WBBL season, people have flocked to watch us. We\u2019ve had great crowds and people watching on the live stream \u2013 so it shows that people want to watch cricket at this time of year and with a bit more promotion we can keep building on that. It\u2019s obviously been a big season for us at Adelaide Strikers and I\u2019m really looking forward to playing in the finals this weekend. To be honest, I\u2019m not mad that we\u2019re not hosting it in Adelaide because Brisbane is probably my second favourite place to play. We always get great crowds at Allan Border Field; it\u2019s a really nice place to play cricket, so we\u2019re feeling relaxed and confident going in. We\u2019re very lucky to have such a great culture in our group. We have a laugh and genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company and I think that\u2019s really hard to achieve. The WBBL is a short tournament, but it\u2019s so intense and we spend almost every day together, so the love is really important and I think we\u2019ve got that. Our focus for the weekend is just going to be on staying calm. The only time we\u2019ve been in a semi-final before, we got thrashed, so this time we want make sure we go in calm and knowing that we deserve to be there. We\u2019ve pretty much played in every scenario possible this season. We\u2019ve had super overs, we\u2019ve thrashed teams and we\u2019ve been thrashed. We don\u2019t know what the finals will bring, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be some great, exciting cricket that will really live up to the festival atmosphere of our first standalone season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
