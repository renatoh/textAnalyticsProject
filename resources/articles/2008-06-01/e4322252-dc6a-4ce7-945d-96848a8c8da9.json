The reasons for voting no are as complex as the disparate forces opposing the Lisbon treaty. Pro-free market groups like Libertas and individual Irish senators claim the deal will lead to tax harmonisation and take away the republic's advantage as a low capital tax haven that has attracted foreign, mainly US multinational investment and fed the Celtic Tiger. Traditional nationalists led by Sinn F\u00e9in argue that ratifying the treaty severely dilutes Ireland's sovereignty. Along with the far left, they also claim that the treaty will commit Irish troops to future EU defence plans and thus end the state's neutrality. Ireland has never been a member of Nato. The Catholic right also opposes the Lisbon treaty, claiming that a strengthened European court of justice will overrule Irish laws such as the republic's outright ban on abortion. What are the implications for Europe's 490 million citizens of Ireland's no vote? It means one of two things. Either the EU will exempt Ireland from the treaty for now and then invite to join at a later date (this would mean the republic having to hold a second referendum as they did with the Nice treaty) or all the EU states would be obliged to renegotiate a new deal with its inevitable endless round of bartering between the member states. Either way, Ireland's failure to ratify the treaty is a severe setback to the whole process of reforming EU structures. What will be the impact of the no vote? Defeat in the referendum is a major setback for the new Irish taoiseach, Brian Cowen, coming just weeks after he succeeded Bertie Ahern as prime minister. Conversely, the victory for the no campaign is a boost for Sinn F\u00e9in, which suffered significant losses in last year's general election. Sinn F\u00e9in is the only party represented in the Dail, or Irish parliament, which is opposed to the Lisbon treaty. How will Ireland be perceived in Europe now its electorate has rejected the deal? France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, has warned that there would be \"gigantic incomprehension\" across the EU if Ireland votes no. Privately, senior Irish government strategists have admitted that failure to ratify the treaty is deeply embarrassing and a body blow to the credibility of Ireland in Europe. They argue that slowing up the process of EU reform would fatally weaken Ireland's influence. Does the no vote mean the Irish have become a nation of Eurosceptics? Not necessarily. Even some of opponents of the treaty are keen to stress that they do not advocate pulling out of the EU entirely. Only a fringe element of Irish politics, both on the far right and extreme left, are in favour of withdrawing from the union. The Irish government had been hoping it did not have to return to the negotiating table and explain to its European partners why their electorate derailed the Lisbon initiative. Turnout appears to have been low and it may turn out that the government's greatest \"enemy\" was the apathy of what commentators call \"middle Ireland\" (which is generally pro-European) and their failure to turn out to vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
