It is a landowner's right to decide who is and who is not allowed to park on their property. It is their prerogative to set the conditions of use of their car park. These terms may include the issue of a parking charge notice (PCN) and/or the threat of clamping, which is used by many parking management companies to manage persistent offenders. Without this deterrent, there would be chaos. Imagine your house is near a station, town centre or stadium. Under the new guidelines, there will be no way of dealing with someone parking on your drive or blocking you in. The only way to handle this would be to cite trespass and obtain a court order for the keeper to remove the vehicle. This could take months. If you touch the car, you could be liable for damaging private property. The government has suggested that ticketing on private land will remain lawful when wheel clamping is banned. Thus if a driver does not abide by a car park's terms and conditions, a PCN can be issued. Currently, the only method of enforcing such regulations is by way of citing contract law. When a driver enters the site, the signs form the basis of the contract. As long as the signage is clear, a driver understands the risks of contravening the conditions of parking. However, contract law is surrounded by complexity and ambiguity, and PCNs are regularly ignored. Before clamping and towing on private land is banned, legislation should be changed to make PCNs in private car parks enforceable.
