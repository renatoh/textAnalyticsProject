And not one of those feel-good Mighty Ducks-style scripts where plucky underdogs defy the odds either: the rich bullies won, the dogs stayed under, and the odds were right on the money. It had the feel of a bonus round in a video game, with premiership contenders doing their best to pump up percentages against tail-end teams. Words like 'pluck' and 'respectability' got bandied around; at least no-one called North Melbourne 'brave' \u2013 they weren't playing. This wasn't about who won, but how much they won by, and the only club that really managed to capitalise was a surprise \u2013 Port Adelaide. They gave GWS the kind of whipping that must make Kevin Sheedy want to pack up his parkas and head south. In recent rounds the young Port team looked like they had run out of puff, but now they're hungry and hateful enough to be back in kissing distance of the eight. Are Carlton the new Richmond? A proud history, a long losing streak and the kind of mishaps and missed chances that leave scars and the sense of bad juju at work. Are Carlton becoming the new Richmond? They took this opportunity to cement their bunny status against Hawthorn, losing 10 in a row. They haven't beaten the Hawks since Crazy Frog was in the charts. But it was the nature of the loss this time that hurt \u2013 flaking out in the final quarter to lose by 14 points. It's not much, but shows the stark difference between clubs that take their chances, and those that miss them just to the outside of the goalpost. Every game Carlton have lost this year has been by 17 points or less. This time it was a tale of two Jarrad/Jarryds. Jarrad Waite came from 7 goals last game to just 7 possessions, while Jarryd Roughead kicked four critical major scores to bring the Hawks back. It's that kind of player who can take games by the scruff of the neck that Carlton lacks, and they will be lacking one more with Marc Murphy out for a month with a fractured jaw. Are Richmond the new Richmond? There should be a German word for the feeling of nervousness football fans get seeing Richmond in the top eight half-way through the season. There is an English word for where they end up though \u2013 in poker tournaments they call it 'the bubble', the first position to miss out on the prize money. In football we call it 'ninth'. The Tigers are looking good, with plenty of run, some talented midfielders, and a couple of forwards who can set a game on fire. But that sentence could have been written plenty of times in the last 25 years, and the run, talent and fires always somehow died out. This time though, they have started to defeat the other teams contending for ninth. They've beat the Blues, they beat the Eagles, and now they've beaten the Crows, who are also psychologically scarred, just in a fresher way. These are exactly the kind of make or break games the Tigers have spent a generation breaking, and they've made them this time. But then, building up false hope would be a very Tigers thing to do. So would losing games against the likes of the Bulldogs, Saints, Roos and Suns. Which are, in fact, their next four games. Steady or risk the Collywobbles This should have been the kind of victory where Collingwood defeated the Bulldogs, sacked their training ground, and drove their kinfolk into slavery. Instead, it was a relatively modest 34 point win, and the barbarian hordes in the stands spent the second half screaming with frustration, not bloodlust. It's true that young teams often fall away after quick starts, and the Pies were fielding 10 players with fewer than 50 games a head. But on this measure of rookies the Bulldogs had 12, and that didn't stop them niggling and wheedling their way back onto the scoreboard. Pressure is still what Collingwood do best, but their tendency to get complacent can turn the full-press into a stop-press after half-time. That won't hurt too badly against a team not kicking straight, but take the foot off against squads with more polish and they'll take the game away. Just ask Carlton. Suddenly Freo are fifth The dark horse of the finals race didn't exactly win this at a gallop, more of a trot. It was at times more like a boxing match than a football game, and Fremantle are clearly still missing firepower in their forward line, but the defensive stranglehold is still holding. Crowley bullied Simon Black so much with his tagging he was sent off tired, and while they were missing Jonathan Brown, the Lions' paltry 46 points weren't just because the Doctor was blowing the wrong way. Aaron Sandilands and Mathew Pavlich coming back in won't solve all their problems, but let's face it, they're not going to make the Dockers any worse. And the hard part is over \u2013 Fremantle face just one top four side (Geelong) between now and September. They're still a little green on finals football, but Zac Dawson might emerge as an unlikely source of stability."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
