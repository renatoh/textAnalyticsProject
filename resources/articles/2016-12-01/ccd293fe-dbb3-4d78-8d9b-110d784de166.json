In contrast to Trump\u2019s declaration, a statement from German president Joachim Gauck did not attempt to reach conclusions, but stressed solidarity among religious and ethnic communities. \u201cThe hatred of the perpetrators will not seduce to hate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not drive a wedge through our coexistence. We will reach out to each other, we will talk to each other and we will care for each other.\u201d Trump\u2019s readiness to cast blame from afar and to emphasize sectarian division \u2013 and the absence of an equivalent statement from his office about an attack on Muslims the same day in Switzerland \u2013 has added urgency to concerns that his gut reactions to world events will act as an amplifier and accelerator of global conflict. His first response to Monday\u2019s wave of violence was a tweet that lumped the Berlin and Swiss attacks together with the killing of the Russian ambassador to Ankara before details of any of the incidents had become clear. Inevitably, given a 140-character limit, there was little detail or explanation. It was unclear whether the president-elect was even aware that the Swiss incident was directed at Muslims, what he meant by \u201cthe civilized world\u201d, or what its new mode of thinking should look like. \u201cIt goes without saying that it\u2019s not good to fire off the cuff,\u201d said Elizabeth Saunders, an assistant political science professor at George Washington University and author of Leaders at War: How Presidents Shape Military Interventions. \u201cWe go through these elections to vet presidents and hopefully hire someone who is calm and level-headed and [will] look at all the information. \u201cWe know that wars start for lots of reasons, but one reason is the problem of information. Countries sometimes misrepresent their policies and intentions and there can be misperceptions even if policy signals are sent sincerely.\u201d Saunders, who is currently a visiting fellow at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations, went on: \u201cSo there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty in foreign policy crises and that\u2019s in the best case. If you add to that Trump saying things that may be independent of the state department and defence department, you are introducing a tremendous amount of uncertainty into a situation that may already be dangerous.\u201d The question of what sources of information Trump uses as the basis for his tweets has become one of the most controversial issues of the transition period, as he has publicly denigrated the intelligence services and questioned the need to receive a daily brief. His closest adviser on foreign policy, his future national security adviser, Michael Flynn, echoes his tendency to focus on the threat of Islamic terrorism to the exclusion of nearly everything else. A leaked Pentagon memo, published by Foreign Policy on Tuesday, outlined the incoming Trump administration\u2019s top \u201cdefence priorities\u201d as the defeat of the Isis, removing ceilings on defence spending, developing a cyber-strategy and cutting costs. There was no mention of Russia, characterised by the nation\u2019s most senior military officer, Gen Joseph Dunford, as \u201can existential threat to the US\u201d. The omission only underlined the unanswered questions about the extent of Moscow\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s election victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
