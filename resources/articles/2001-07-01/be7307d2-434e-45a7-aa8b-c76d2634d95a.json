Just get me home...", "bodyText": "Ozzer and the Aussies. It seems we don't get on. It all began on Friday. That stuff about the Aussie male and their newspapers and my mate Justin Harrison. It was a bit cheeky, I'll admit. But what do you want? Thursday: went out and hit 250 tackle bags. No87 was a real beaut. Friday: went out and hit 250 tackle bags. Left shoulder drive not quite right. I know that's what we've been doing all tour, but is that what you want? By the way, I was lying about the left shoulder. The Aussies whacked back my comments on their males, their country and my mate Justin and here I am. In the bunker, the doghouse, bad books, all in one go in this country that may have uranium and opals but hasn't found the irony mine yet. Why can't they find their own Ozzer? Could I charge them for using all my Guardian stuff? If I put a bill into the Sydney Morning Herald for . . . what's that word? Plagiarism, is it? Would they pay? I think I may need it. I feel a fine coming on. The thing is that when Matt Dawson wrote his Bridget Jones on the Bounty, we won. I suppose I could say I was doing my bit for the cause. Up yours, I said. Now we've lost, it's bound to be used as the reason. Austin's column cost us the tour. Up mine, I suppose. I don't think I'm to blame for the defeat, or third-world debt or the Olympics going to Beijing, but it's been a weird time and anything is possible. So, here I am, lying low. Pass the valium. I mean it. I'm on the hard stuff. I've got a bulging disc in my back. Facet joints T6 and 7, so they say. It started as a stitch on Wednesday but had moved round to my back on Friday. Sorry about the details. I know it sounds a bit like tackle bags and a No87 cruncher. But when it's your own back you tend to get a bit more interested in the boring details. Anyway, they gave it a scan and the physio gave it a click on Saturday morning. That helped a bit but I was in no shape to go 12 rounds . . . sorry, play 80 minutes against Justin. So, here I am in the bunker. Bad back, hangover, the lot. What's left to do? The good bits? The win against ACT. I loved that game, even if I picked up the injury that made me miss the second Test. To score in injury-time and for Matt to be the one to kick the conversion was just brilliant. And watching the first Test was pretty good. Just the way the lads forgot about game plan, game plan and let their heads do the guiding. They went with their instincts. I know that can get you into trouble, but you've got to gamble sometimes. Well, you've got to gamble a lot, I always say. I've had a good tour playing cards, by the way. The bad bits? Losing the series. I could start again on the Aussies here. But now is probably not the best time. In fact, I could probably start on our approach to the Tests. But that might make the fine worse. I just feel that we went for a rigid approach. Set piece followed by drives. That's what the homework showed would work, apparently. Well, the Aussies did their own homework. They stopped our lineout and even did well at the scrum. And that left us with . . . well, it left us losing. Sour grapes? Possibly. But I tell you this. My mate Justin had a bit of a game, didn't he? Of course, he had the freedom of the park without me there to irritate him. Well played, Justin. Wow, that didn't hurt too much. Not like this back, this head. So, what now? Please take me away from anything to do with rugby. I know there'll be an element of cold turkey. No tackle bags, no cones - we'll be shaking and screaming in the night. But I think we may have earned ourselves a break. And Australia? Funnily enough, I can't wait to be back. In an England shirt. I know Iain Balshaw can't wait either. There, you knew I wouldn't be down for long. Round one to the Aussies, but there's a long way to go yet. I don't know about doing a newspaper column again. Mind you, I seem to appear all over the place here. Perhaps the Sydney Morning Ferret might sign me up. God, what am I saying? It really is time to go home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
