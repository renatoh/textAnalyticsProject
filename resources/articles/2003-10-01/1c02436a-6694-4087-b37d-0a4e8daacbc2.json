Four minutes later he finally stopped - much to the relief of seismologists across Europe, who had been bewildered by massive tremors measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale. Meanwhile, the 10 nations gathered for the Euro 2004 play-off draw awaited their fate. But Lennart had other ideas. First he launched into a rambling eyes-down mumble a la Pope John Paul II. Then, to nervous coughs in the hall, he started eyeing the 10 orange-coloured draw balls as if they were succulent, super-crumbly Scotch eggs. Fortunately, before Lennart could gulp them down whole, Uefa media bigwig Mike Lee appeared off-stage holding a piping-hot plate of bratwurst - which steamed up Lennart's glasses. His concentration temporarily diverted, an official was able to start a draw which proved to have more drama than BBC2's entire autumn schedule. First out, Latvia, drawn against Turkey. Then, to audible gasps, Berti Vogts' Mighty Scottish Army, paired with over-rated underachievers Holland. Shortly afterwards Croatia were matched with Slovenia, Spain with Norway and - most intriguingly of all - Russia with Wales. In the hall, the doomsayers put on their gore-tex anoraks and mumbled about Scotland not beating the Dutch since 1982. But Berti was not for flinching. \"It is a tough one. We're underdogs and they're the favourites - but it is still just two games,\" he wisely philosophised. \"Anything can happen and we have a chance.\" Indeed they do. As do Wales, whose pairing with Russia had Mark Hughes in bullish mood. \"We have got to be reasonably happy with the draw,\" he crocodile-smiled. \"We are playing the second leg at home and I think everyone's view is that is an advantage.\" But what of Lennart, you ask? Well, as usual, he's not giving anything away. \"I will not be the person predicting winners and losers - we will see what happens,\" he told the Fiver, before licking the lenses of his specs. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"This is no publicity stunt\" - The 196pt text on Darlo chairman George Reynolds's sandwich board referring to his plan to offer Paul Gascoigne a playing contract. TALKING TURKEY Later, after a hearty lunch at McUefa, Lennart Johansson was looking forward to settling down with a good video and a large pile of cream-based cakes. So imagine the big man's face when Mike Lee announced there'd been a change to the schedule, and instead of watching the Die Hard trilogy and devouring Krispy Kreams, poor Lennart would have to sit through another of Lee's Dirty Discipline videos. And not the dusty variety our Weird Uncle swears by, but a re-run of England's game in Turkey! \"We've started proceedings against the Turkish FA for a lack of order and discipline in the stadium,\" explained Lee, as Lennart's sugar-encrusted lower lip began to quiver. \"This will lead to a disciplinary charge to be heard at the control and disciplinary body meeting on October 30.\" Sensing Lee's rap could run and run, Lennart made a bolt for the door, ripping it from its hinges en route to the canteen. \"As a result of Pierluigi Collina's report into that marvellous half-time free-for-all on Saturday,\" Lee reminded himself, \"we have to make sure that he did not miss anything before deciding whether or not to take disciplinary action.\" Though he stopped short of admitting it, Mr Lee was probably referring specifically to Alpay, who after an evening of incitement has gone on the defensive. \"I've heard what has been written in the English newspapers,\" sniffed the Turk, either referring to the Enin' Stanah's claim that Villa will offload him on the cheap in January, or the Shane Richie seven-in-a-bed sex-romp revelations. \"It was just a small incident in a football match,\" moped Alpay, confirming the former. \"I am being crucified because of the recent history of trouble between the two countries, and for being rude about the wrong Mrs Beckham.\" Better get in another box of cr\u00e8me puffs, Len old son; this could be a long film. THE RUMOUR MILL Mark Viduka might be leaving Leeds for either European champions AC Milan or Blackburn Rovers. Which one, eh? Which one? Southampton's systematic humiliation of Spurs continues apace, with news that the promising Rohan Ricketts will leave White Hart Lane for St Mary's. NEWS IN BRIEF Brian Little has been named as Tranmere's new manager. The 49-year-old, who returns to management after a year out of the game following his sacking by Hull, takes over from Ray Mathias who was dismissed two weeks ago. \"I am hopeful of turning things around quickly,\" he announced, as if he would say anything else. Scotland U-21s have been paired with Croatia in the Euro 2004 play-offs. The first leg will be played in Croatia on November 15 or 16, with the return in Scotland on November 18 or 19. The Scottish FA are hoping to stage the finals of the tournament next year. A nightclub boss apologised today for a promotion campaign which offered prizes to revellers who guessed the names of footballers allegedly involved in the rape of a 17-year-old girl. Clubbers were contacted by text message and offered free tickets and drinks at Tyneside's Tuxedo Princess floating nightclub if they emailed the names of Premiership players who were at the centre of the allegations. In case anybody wants to go, Tuxedo Princess is \"very near the Tex-Mex place the Celtic boys got nicked in last Christmas\", according to regular patron Weird Uncle Fiver.
