But, as of next season, this could become a spat between equals. Amid the pounding tension at Gay Meadow, Shropshire could lose its only league club this evening. Shrewsbury, four points adrift at the foot of the Football League, host Carlisle with their slender chances of survival dependent on plucking wins from their final two games. Yet only 16 weeks ago they humbled Everton, a side on the verge of European qualification, in the FA Cup. \"These are the same players that played out of their skin that day,\" sighed the Shrews manager Kevin Ratcliffe. \"They're the same lads who proved they were good enough last season, but when you go into a tailspin confidence sinks. These days they're coming up against teams who are nowhere near as good as Everton and they're getting drubbed.\" Ratcliffe has hauled Shrewsbury, who have been a league club for 53 years, from the brink once before, edging them to a 2-1 win at Exeter on the final day three years ago to condemn Chester to the Conference. But this time they must overcome Carlisle and Scunthorpe, their first and potentially last opponents in the league, to stand any chance. Given that it is 14 games since they last won a match, the omens are not promising. On Saturday at Hartlepool grumbling discontent at the manager's selections escalated into bitter and vocal criticism as their 374 supporters saw them suffer a sixth successive defeat. Pete Wilding, outstanding at centre-half against Everton, is labouring in an unfamiliar midfield berth while confidence-sapped defenders sink without trace behind him to the tune of 87 goals conceded. Of the level-headed veterans, Ian Woan was dismissed for an elbow and Nigel Jemson has conjured only three league goals since sinking David Moyes's side. To complete a miserable picture their leading goalscorer Luke Rodgers was yesterday ordered to pay \u00a35,000 compensation and complete 100 hours community service for causing actual bodily harm to a teenage girl with a firework. \"We're afraid of Conference football,\" said the former Sunderland winger Sam Aiston, one of 11 players whose contracts expire in June. \"But it's no fluke we are where we are. After 40-odd games it's no good pretending otherwise: we're the worst team in the league.\" There have been messages of support from the Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and Moyes, a former Shrews captain, but even kind words are starting to ring hollow. Relegation would not ruin Shrewsbury financially; the revenue generated by their FA Cup run - they earned \u00a3100,000 from their win over Everton and a further \u00a3265,000 from their televised fourth-round exit to Chelsea - secured the immediate future. But the toils of their local rivals Chester and Hereford in trying to regain league status have not gone unnoticed. The club's chairman Roland Wycherley would retain a professional playing staff, though whether his manager, with two years to run on his contract, would remain is doubtful. \"My situation will have to be addressed at some point but the most important thing is to keep Shrewsbury in the league,\" said Ratcliffe. \"I was a good manager when we beat Everton and I know I'm still a good manager.\" They will find empathy, if little sympathy, from tonight's visitors. Carlisle have had their own traumatic season, unrest surfacing again last week when the manager Roddy Collins forcibly expelled his on-loan midfielder Stuart Green from the team bus en route to Torquay, where they won 3-2, after discovering he had been attempting to engineer a return to Hull City. A win tonight would secure safety and spare Carlisle the excruciating finales from which they somehow emerged unscathed in 1999, thanks to a goal from their loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass, and 2000, when they lost at Brighton but still survived at Chester's expense on goals scored. \"Now it's about doing it one more time,\" said Collins. Should they succeed, and with Telford cackling in anticipation down the road, Salop will drop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
