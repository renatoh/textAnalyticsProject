This week, Bachelet said she was \u201cdeeply disturbed and saddened to see violence, destruction, deaths and injuries in Chile\u201d. Since the unrest erupted on 19 October, the military and Carabineros police forces have made 2,410 arrests throughout the country \u2013 200 of which involved minors \u2013 and 535 people have been injured, according to Chile\u2019s human rights commission, INDH. At least 18 people have died in the violence. The INDH confirmed that it was compiling 55 legal cases related to five homicides and eight instances of sexual violence involving both police and military agents, which will be investigated by Chile\u2019s public prosecution service. A special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate alleged human rights violations in 13 districts of Santiago. Since a student protest over subway prices swelled into a nationwide movement against the government, vast peaceful demonstrations have taken place throughout the country. But the government\u2019s response has largely focused on efforts to contain outbreaks of violence and looting. Chile\u2019s centre-right president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, has come under intense criticism for his response to the unrest, after he appeared on television \u2013 flanked by military commanders \u2013 and announced that Chile was \u201cat war with a violent enemy\u201d. Pi\u00f1era declared a state of emergency in much of the country, declaring night-time curfews and deploying tanks and troops to quell the worst unrest Chile has faced since the end of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship. The president later changed tack, scrapping subway charge increases and deferring a 9.2% increase in electricity tariffs. But the moves have failed to appease protesters, who have continued to pour on to the streets demanding profound change to how the country functions and is governed. Fresh clashes broke out on Thursday as stone-throwing protesters did battle with police firing teargas and water cannons in Santiago, and the port city of Valparaiso, as hundreds of demonstrators gathered in city squares around the country. The human rights arm of the Organization of American States, a pan-regional forum, has also announced that it will convene in Ecuador on 11 November to discuss the alleged violations and has asked both the public and Chilean government to provide evidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
