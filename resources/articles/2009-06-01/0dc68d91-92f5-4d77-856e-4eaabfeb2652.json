Cecil had not sent out a winner here for seven years, but Father Time showed the sort of authority that was a trademark of his runners in his glory years, powering away in the final furlong to win by four lengths from Your Old Pal. Black Bear Island, a disappointment in the Derby, was third, with the Queen's Free Agent fourth. The victory was so comprehensive that Cecil will now give serious consideration to the St Leger at Doncaster in September, when a victory would bring him his 25th British Classic. \"I thought that both horses [the winner and Native Ruler] had good chances and that this was my best chance of the week,\" Cecil said. \"I hadn't really thought about the St Leger, but I can think about it now. \"He's a bit of a baby and he's taken time to come to himself, but he's very athletic. \"He's a funny little horse, an own-brother to Passage Of Time, who didn't really get a mile and a half, but he looks like he gets it really well. He's got a lot of potential and hopefully he'll go on from here.\" Cecil, who has been receiving treatment for stomach cancer since 2006, added that he still has plenty of ambitions in racing. \"I want to get to 100 [Royal meeting winners],\" Cecil said, \"but I've had a few flat years and it takes a bit of catching up, so I've still got quite a lot to do. \"It's always good to win here, [but] you have to have the best. You don't win here with second-best and, even if you give your best, it may not be good enough. \"Healthwise, I'm not tip-top, but I'm still alive, aren't I?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
