If the ground came up soft or even heavy, then he could be supplemented.\u201d Native River, who was third in the King George last year, returned this season with victory at Aintree last weekend and would have to be supplemented for Kempton. He has been introduced at 16-1 for the King George by the sponsors Ladbrokes. Lostintranslation is joint-favourite with Cyrname for the Kempton highlight after his defeat of Bristol De Mai in the Betfair Chase at Haydock last month, and his trainer enthused about his chances on Tuesday. \u201cLostintranslation has come out of Haydock beautifully. He is a big, strong horse in the peak of his powers at the moment and I couldn\u2019t be happier with him,\u201d said Tizzard. \u201cThere is no doubt he has got the pace for Kempton and he showed at Haydock he has got more stamina than Bristol De Mai, which is another feather in his cap. \u201dHe is a beautiful horse, but it is going to be a really tough race. Cyrname looks fantastic, Altior is a fantastic horse, Clan Des Obeaux won it last year and I don\u2019t know what the Irish are going to send over.\u201d Tizzard has also not yet ruled out running Thistlecrack in the race for the fourth time though is presently in favour of running last year\u2019s King George runner-up in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot on 21 December. Tizzard said: \u201cThistlecrack has come out of the race at Newbury fine. The question for ourselves is, is the staying hurdle division easier than the King George/Gold Cup division? Yes it is. There is a very good chance he will stay over hurdles. If one or two in the King George dropped out that might change, but at the moment I would say we are leaning towards the hurdles route. \u201cIt was a lovely run at Newbury. He is 11 going on 12, so we have got to mind him because he has been delicate. He might only want three runs this year and if we don\u2019t think he is right [for Ascot] we might wait until the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham at the end of January.\u201d Tony Paley"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
