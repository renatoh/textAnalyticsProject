Unfortunately, his suggestion that the British government has ignored Bolivia is sadly untrue. Instead of ignoring Bolivia, as a series of papers I obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show, the last Labour government systematically tried to pressure Evo Morales, following his nationalisation of Bolivian oil and gas. Briefing papers for Kim Howells and Mike O'Brien's meeting with Bolivian representatives talk about BP, BG and Shell much more than Morales's anti-poverty measures. They talk about the dangers of Morales's \"wholly new philosophy of increasing state control over the whole oil and gas chain\". They threaten the Bolivians with legal action and a freeze on investment, if Morales sticks by nationalisation. In heavily redacted documents, officials talk about the dangers \"if Bolivia goes the wrong way\" and sticks with nationalisation. A joint visit to Bolivia by Labour and Conservative lords took a similar stance. The biggest block to better relations with Bolivia comes from British governments that act as the political arm of oil and gas companies. Solomon Hughes Southampton \u2022 Julian Glover is right to remind us of past British links to South America. While studying British involvement in one country, Peru, between 1815 and 1915, I found British soldiers recruited for Peru's wars of independence from Spain; a flood of British exports to the new republic; British establishment of the first regular steamships to South America, the PSNC; and Britons shipping guano for our fields and alpaca to our mills. Britain took a major part in developing Peru's railways. A British company, the Peruvian Corporation, took over Peru's national debt in the 1890s. And a major scandal, a British company responsible for the mistreatment of Amazon rubber workers in the 1900s, was denounced in Westminster Abbey and investigated by parliament. When I lived in Peru in the 1970s, there were still British families who had worked there for generations. Our children went to Anglo-Peruvian schools, where Peruvian staff taught children of both nationalities in Spanish, and British staff taught the same children in English. Some of their parents were involved in British-sponsored aid projects to develop local fisheries or industries. Britain was one of four nations in the Majes project, a major irrigation scheme channelling water from the Andes to give new life to a desert region. Today, in the UK, an Anglo-Peruvian Society fosters good relations between our countries, and institutions like Canning House offer information and expertise to those looking for opportunities in Peru. No doubt other South American countries provide similar stories. Arthur Robinson York"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
