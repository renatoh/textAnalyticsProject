Hill, who filled the same position at Gloucester before leaving four years ago, is looking for a job after being a victim of the shake-up in Wales, where he had been assistant coach at Newport. He had two years left on his contract there but was paid off last month. The Scotland prop David Hilton, Hill's team-mate at Bath, has taken over as forwards' coach and even though Bristol have lost more than 20 players since being relegated last May, a squad of 18 turned up for training this week. Pearce announced his intention to sell the club in December, but he has struggled to find a buyer. A six-man consortium, led by the former Bristol players Alan Morley and Nigel Pomphrey, has been negotiating for the past two months and a source at the club last night said a deal was expected within a week. Peter Richards, the England A scrum-half, became the latest player to leave Bristol yesterday when he joined Wasps, along with the former Leeds back rower Ian Clarke. The New Zealand centre Paul Steinmetz has joined Ulster and the former All Blacks captain Taine Randell will sign for Saracens if he is left out of the World Cup squad. The Wales A No8 Andrew Powell has left Gwent Dragons for B\u00e9ziers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
