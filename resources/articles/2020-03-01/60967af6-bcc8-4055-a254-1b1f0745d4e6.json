It wasn\u2019t an epic match - but it was an epic occasion, and we\u2019ll be talking about that first period of extra-time forever. In the end, just as at Italia 90, it ended in the cruellest possible way. For the last two and a half weeks, England\u2019s euphoric Euro 96 campaign has been our entire world. And like that, it\u2019s gone. Terry Venables runs straight over to Gareth Southgate, whose life has just taken the most horrible turn. Jurgen Klinsmann also limps over to console him - and then Tony Adams drags him over to start a lap of honour before beckoning the rest of the England team to join them. There are no tears, as far as I can tell, but a few of the players are close. A lot of them look in shock. It\u2019s over. Moller smashes his penalty down the middle and then mimicks Gascoigne\u2019s peacock celebration. England are out in the most heartbreaking circumstances, again. KOPKE SAVES FROM SOUTHGATE! Germany 5-5 England It was a tame penalty, and Kopke pushed it away as he dived to his right. Now Germany are one kick away from putting England out of Euro 96. It\u2019s Gareth Southgate in fact... KUNTZ SCORES! Germany 5-5 England An unbelievable penalty from Kuntz, who clips it high into the net. Now it\u2019s sudden death. Who\u2019s next for England? It can\u2019t be Ince, surely. You\u2019d have to think it\u2019ll be McManaman or Anderton. SHERINGHAM SCORES! Germany 4-5 England Sheringham curls it into the top corner as well! If Stefan Kuntz doesn\u2019t score, Germany are out. ZIEGE SCORES! Germany 4-4 England Yet another great penalty. Seaman went the right way but it was right in the corner. The standard is stratospheric. GASCOIGNE SCORES! Germany 3-4 England A majestic penalty from Gascoigne, steered into the top corner. He celebrates with a peacock pose and tries to whip the crowd up even more. REUTER SCORES! Germany 3-3 England Seaman got hands on that! He\u2019s furious with himself for not saving it. PEARCE SCORES! Germany 2-3 England Pearce completes the exorcism of 1990, sending Kopke the wrong way. This time he celebrates with a modest thumbs up rather than the full Psycho of Saturday. And now it\u2019s Stuart Pearce... STRUNZ SCORES! Germany 2-2 England Strunz, who came on right at the end of extra-time, places a brilliant penalty into the top-left corner. PLATT SCORES! Germany 1-2 England I was worried about Platt but he has tucked his penalty away, just as he did in Turin six years ago. Kopke went the right way, diving to his left, but the ball had too much height for him to reach. Good penalty. HASSLER SCORES! Germany 1-1 England A terrific penalty, dragged right into the bottom corner. Seaman went the right way but had no chance. SHEARER SCORES! Germany 0-1 England Nerveless stuff from Shearer, who curls it high to the right. Paul Ince, by the way, can\u2019t watch. He is sitting down in the centre circle, looking away from goal. He looks like he\u2019s about to vomit. England will go first, as they did on Saturday. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Ruth Purdue. \u201cHope you\u2019re well. What is England\u2019s record with penalty shoot-outs?\u201d They\u2019ve won one and lost one. Germany/West Germany have won three and lost one. Of course, those records include the Italia 90 semi-final, when Pearce and Chris Waddle missed and England were beaten. Some England players look more relaxed than others. Shearer looks fine, Gascoigne is chatting away with Venables. It looks like he\u2019s demonstrating what happened with that agonising near miss in the first period of extra time. Jamie Redknapp, most of the back-up players in fact, look relieved that they won\u2019t be facing the firing squad. We know four of the England penalty takers: Shearer, Platt, Pearce and Gascoigne, in that order, all scored against Spain. Robbie Fowler was down for the other one on Saturday. I suppose the man he replaced, Teddy Sheringham, will take the fifth tonight. For the second time in five days, England\u2019s hopes and dreams depend on a penalty shoot-out. It\u2019s a great way to win a game, let\u2019s just say that. 120 min Dieter Eilts, who has had an amazing game defensively, makes one last intervention. A bouncing ball from the right kicked up towards Platt, who improvised a neat, speculative header over the defence. Anderton was just about to reach it in the area when Eilts came across to thigh the ball away and run it to safety. The whistle had gone for offside against Anderton, but nobody knew that at the time. 119 min It\u2019s a poor corner, cleared at the near post. 119 min England get a very generous corner on the right. Platt was already apologising to his team-mates for cocking things up when the decision went in England\u2019s favour. Matthias Sammer asks the referee what the feck is going on. We\u2019ll never hear the end of it if England score from this. Before the corner is taken, Thomas Strunz replaces the injured Freund. 118 min Both teams are still trying to win this. Kuntz\u2019s reverse pass from the right just runs away from the unmarked Bode in the area. 116 min Another German injury! It\u2019s Freund who is struggling now, after a challenge from Anderton. He\u2019s stretchered off, so Germany will be down to 10 men until they can sort a replacement. 115 min: CHANCE FOR McMANAMAN! Sammer, deep inside the England half, gave the ball away for one of the few times tonight and England charged forward on the counter-attack. Gascoigne, McManaman and Shearer combined before Shearer guided a through pass down the inside-right channel. McManaman got to it first on the edge of the area, just ahead of Eilts, but his first touch took him slightly away from goal. The angle was tight and he could only hit a weary low shot that was easily held by the tumbling Kopke. The break was so fast that McManaman had no support, so he had to go for goal. 114 min: INCE HEADS OFF THE LINE! I think Seaman had it covered, but Ince didn\u2019t take any chances. Moller\u2019s deep corner from the left was pulled down on the thigh by the substitute Bode, who hooked it back towards goal on the turn. Ince, standing in front of Seaman in the six-yard box, used his loaf to get the ball clear. 113 min Compared to the first half, the second period of extra-time has been an oasis of calm. I wouldn\u2019t say either side has settled for penalties, but they look like they have accepted it\u2019s the likeliest scenario. 110 min Another Germany substitution: the limping Thomas Helmer is replaced by the utility player Marco Bode. Germany have had such bad luck with injuries throughout this tournament, and now they have two players - Reuter and Moller - suspended from the final should they get there. 107 min Southgate plays a nervous, underhit pass across the face of the England area. For a split-second it looks like Kuntz is going to get there first and move through on goal - but then Adams throws himself at the ball to boot it clear. 107 min: ZIEGE MISSES AN EXCELLENT CHANCE! Dear lord, make it stop. This is too much to bear. Ziege, this strutting left-back from Bayern, zips infield and finds Moller in the D. He controls the ball and plays a return pass to Ziege, who gets on the inside of Southgate but pokes the ball wide of the far post from 10 yards. That was another great chance. 106 min England begin the second period of extra time. This is it: 15 minutes to score a Golden Goal or it will be penalties, just as it was at Italia 90. Still no sign of any England substitutions. I\u2019d be really tempted to introduce the youthful dynamism of Robbie Fowler or maybe Steve Stone. It would give the crowd a lift as well. Half time in extra time: Germany 1-1 England That was one of the great periods of extra time. 105 min Shearer runs Babbel down the right \u2013 it\u2019s been a brilliant contest between those two - and crosses low. Sammer\u2019s clearance comes to Anderton, who drags a volley well wide from 25 yards. 104 min Another fine interception from Adams, who has been immense. England race down the other end, where McManaman\u2019s curling cross is again just in front of the stretching Gascoigne in the six-yard box. That was nowhere near as close as the earlier chance. Gascoigne\u2019s fitness was criticised earlier in the tournament but he looks England\u2019s liveliest player at the moment. 102 min A couple of uneventful minutes. It\u2019s as if both teams are having an unspoken timeout after that astonishing start to extra-time. 101 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says George Wright. \u201cI\u2019m only 12 and yet to get any sense of perspective, which I\u2019m sure will come any day now. It\u2019s so tense that I\u2019ve already cried once and I spent the break before extra-time playing an aggressive game of wall-ie in my friend\u2019s back yard to let off some steam.\u201d 100 min I\u2019ve never seen anything like these last few minutes, never in all ma puff. Replays show what happened with Gascoigne\u2019s chance. He was in front of Sammer and Freund \u2013 but then he half stopped, because he thought Kopke was going to get a touch on the ball. Had he kept going he would have run the bal into the net, and he\u2019d probably still be celebrating in the dentist\u2019s chair come the new millennium. 99 min: HOW DID GASCOIGNE NOT SCORE THERE?! Gascoigne is a stud\u2019s length away from winning the match! He started the move by winning the ball off Hassler on the England left. Anderton then gave it to Sheringham, who drove a crossfield pass towards Shearer on the right of the area. He pulled away from Babbel, watched the ball onto his right foot and belted a volley back across goal. It bobbled past the diving Kopke in the six-yard box, leaving Gascoigne in front of an open goal \u2013 but somehow he missed the ball as he lunged with his left foot. I have no idea what happened. It was an open goal, and he seemed certain to score. Gascoigne ended up in the net, face down. If only the ball was with him. Nobody scripts this stuff, nobody. 97 min Germany burst forward again. Hassler finds Moller, whose cross is brilliantly headed away by \u2026 McManaman. This is incredible. A chess match has suddenly morphed into basketball. 97 min Having seen a replay, I think that probably was a foul by Kuntz, who dragged Southgate out of the way as the corner came in. It was still a brave decision from Sandor Puhl, because I don\u2019t think anyone spotted it at the time. Kuntz\u2019s lack of complaint probably tells a story. 97 min: KUNTZ HAS A GOAL DISALLOWED! I thought England were out of Euro 96. Moller\u2019s inswinging corner from the left was headed into the top corner by Kuntz, despite Gascoigne attempting to punch it clear on the line. Time stood still \u2026 until everyone realised the referee had blown for a foul by Kuntz on Southgate. That looks really soft to me - I don\u2019t think Luntz did anything wrong. \u201cThe country\u2019s pulse rate,\u201d says Barry Davies, \u201cmust be beyond natural science.\u201d 96 min: GOOD SAVE BY SEAMAN! This is heart-stopping stuff. Moller gets a lucky ricochet off Ince in his own half and surges into a very big gap. It\u2019s a three-on-three break, with the central player Adams trying to hold things up for as long as possible. Eventually Moller gets to within 25 yards of goal and hammers a rising drive that Seaman tips acrobatically over the bar. 95 min And now Anderton\u2019s snapshot is blocked by Babbel. So much for the Golden Goal promoting caution. Both teams are swinging haymakers all over the place. 94 min Now Germany threaten to win it! Eilts, on the left wing, stabs a pass inside to the marauding Helmer. He looks up and absolutely leathers a cross that flashes across the six-yard box, just in front of Kuntz. 93 min: ANDERTON HITS THE POST!!!! England were this close to winning the match after just 80 seconds of extra time. Platt played an excellent pass infield to find McManaman in space on the right of the area. His pull-back was missed by the diving Kopke and reached the unmarked Anderton, who screwed it off the near post and back into the arms of Kopke! That is unbelievable. The ball from McManaman was slightly behind Anderton, which is why he hit it onto the post rather than into the net. But had he put it in front of Anderton, Kopke would have got to it. Sammer punches the air in the direction of the linesman \u2013 he was busy appealing for offside against McManaman, which is why Anderton had so much space in the middle. 92 min During the break before extra-time, the BBC panel suggested bringing on Les Ferdinand for Sheringham, who hasn\u2019t had a great night. I\u2019d go for Robbie Fowler, who would love an opportunity for glory like this. 91 min Germany begin the first period of extra-time. Still no substitutions from Terry Venables. The players of both sides take a quick break on the field. Paul Ince and David Platt are having a pretty lively exchange of views; not sure what that\u2019s about, but Ian Walker seems to find it amusing enough. Extra time, the Golden Goal, maybe penalties. It was always going to come to this, wasn\u2019t it. 90+1 min Platt\u2019s snapshot from 20 yards is deflected behind for a corner. I\u2019d like to see the line of the ball before it hit the German defender, because it looked like he caught it sweetly. 90 min Ince gives a nation of 48 million people a collective coronary by losing the ball to Moller on the halfway line. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay: Germany break two on three but Kuntz overhits his return pass to Moller. 89 min Oh lord, they\u2019re singing Rule Britannia. 88 min \u201cOn the odd occasion you see Gazza in full flight don\u2019t you wonder what might have been?\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cAs the most talented English player I\u2019ve ever seen (admittedly I am only 19) I can\u2019t help but feel that, apart from a purple patch at Lazio, his has been a tale of unfulfilled potential.\u201d He might fulfil it in the next five days. I know what you mean, though: although there have been regular moments of genius, he\u2019s never been quite the same player since that cruciate injury in 1991. 87 min The pace is still frantic \u2013 the second half has flown by \u2013 but both teams look like they are starting to get their heads round the idea of extra-time. 85 min \u201cIf it does go to penalties,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI hope for England\u2019s sake Uri Geller hasn\u2019t used up all his mind- and ball-bending powers on Gary McAllister.\u201d He\u2019s still claiming that, is he? Mind you, it was utterly weird. 84 min There are audible groans from the England fans as Sheringham, who has struggled tonight, plays the ball all the way back to Pearce. That\u2019s the first bit of dissent all night, I think. 82 min Ince, who is really on one now, takes the ball off Gascoigne and finds his Sheringham on the left. He cuts infield and plays a give-and-go with Gascoigne before being dispossessed in the area by Eilts \u201cyet again\u201d, as Barry Davies puts it. Eilts\u2019 engine and positional awareness are quite something. 81 min It\u2019s been a good second half, much better than the first. Yet it\u2019s still been a game of few clear chances. Kopke has had only one fairly difficult save to make, Seaman none. 79 min: MOLLER IS OUT OF THE FINAL! At this rate, Germany will need to play a back-up goalkeeper outfield if they get to the final. I feel a bit sorry for Moller on this occasion. He was caught by the studs of Ince a split-second after he hit a chest/volley over the bar from 25 yards, and was on the floor holding his foot when Pearce tried to drag him up by the arm. Moller lashed out with a closed fist in Pearce\u2019s general direction, and although he didn\u2019t really make contact, Sandor Puhl decided to book him. Sammer and Pearce then had a full and frank exchange of wagged fingers. I\u2019m pretty sure Pearce\u2019s gesture was well-intentioned, but those block tackles can bloody hurt so you can understand why Moller didn\u2019t appreciate it. 77 min The first substitution: Thomas Hassler, one of the survivors of 1990, replaces Mehmet Scholl. 76 min There\u2019s an exquisite tension around Wembley. The Golden Goal doesn\u2019t come into play until extra-time, but we\u2019re getting to the stage where one false move could be fatal for either side. 75 min \u201cWatching this while on a \u2018team-building week away with colleagues,\u201d says Bernard. \u201cMostly down caves by day, but finished early today but ate dinner quickly to nab the best seats in front of the TV in the hotel, which is ironically very German for an Englishman, an Irishman and an Italian In good spirits and loving the English fan\u2019s humour. Surprised that no one has mentioned the large banner displayed by a group of women in the crowd, proclaiming \u2018English girls prefer Seaman to Flowers\u2019! The BBC cut away from it as soon as it was legible.\u201d I blame the Girlie Show. And yes, I do watch it religiously. 73 min Gascoigne is booked \u2013 but don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not on a yellow card this time. It was an naive lunge at Kuntz on the left-wing, and the referee had no real choice. 72 min England try the Spurs corner again; this time Sheringham\u2019s shot is blocked by the sliding Moller. For a split-second it looked like Sheringham had the run on him. 72 min \u201cHello Rob!\u201d says Phil West. \u201cI\u2019m a 35-year-old on holiday in Blighty from Istanbul with his wife and young child - and we\u2019re staying with a friend in Sunderland. All of the blokes, and a couple of the ladies, are glued to the box. We remember 1970 and 1990 and after the Holland game we were pretty hopeful, but the longer this game goes on we know it\u2019s going to penalties isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve started a wager on who\u2019s going to miss the final penalty. I\u2019ve got Gascoigne based on the logic that he\u2019s been so good all tournament. What do you think?\u201d Not sure why but I\u2019ve never trusted Platt on penalties. If it does go to penalties, and he\u2019s still on the pitch, I\u2019d be worried about him. The tournament is due a Golden Goal, though - we haven\u2019t had one in three games so far. 71 min Gascoigne is flying now. He harasses Scholl into an error just inside the German half and surges into space. Sammer makes a good tackle from behind, but Gascoigne keeps going as the ball runs to Anderton. He plays a through pass towards Gascoigne, and Helmer stretches desperately to divert the ball behind for a corner. Gascoigne was this close to being through on Kopke. He smiles broadly anyway, looking for Eilts or anyone else to make eye contact and share his sheer enjoyment of association football. There\u2019s a break in play while Helmer receives treatment; he might have pulled something in stretching to make that clearance. 69 min Gascoigne, in the centre circle, drives a pass towards Shearer on the edge of the box. The last man Babbel gets there first, cocks up his attempted clearance but recovers calmly to make a vital tackle. Shearer would have been through on goal. 68 min This is another good spell for England, with Germany struggling to get out of their own half. 67 min The camera cuts to Pele in the crowd. His face is obscured by a bloke in front, who yawns for the entire duration of his unexpected television appearance. 66 min Shearer cuts inside Babbel on the left and curls a dangerous cross that is brilliantly headed away by the flying Eilts, appearing in between Platt and Sheringham. England, as Barry Davies observes on the BBC, are asking more of the questions at the moment. 64 min Gascoigne uses his strength and skill to wriggle away from Moller and Fruend on the edge of the area. Then he stabs the ball one side of Ziege, runs round the other and strains every sinew to stand up a fine cross. Helmer heads it clear. After an iffy start, Gascoigne has played really well in the second half. The same could be said of the whole team. 62 min Sammer, boxed in by the left edge of the German area, drives a long pass right across the penalty box to Scholl on the other side of the field. His confidence and calmness are unreal. 60 min McManaman has moved to the right, swapping wings with Anderton. England have slowed down a little after that flying start to the second half. 59 min: HELMER MISSES AN EXCELLENT CHANCE! Bloody hell, England dodged a bullet there. Germany kept the ball for 30 seconds or so before opening England up with a quick, zig-zag passing move: Ziege infield to Scholl, who moved it back outside to Eilts on the left wing. A smart first touch took him away from Platt, who committed himself, and with his second he pulled the ball back into a dangerous area. Kuntz ignored the ball at the near post so that it could run on to Helmer, who swept a first-time shot over the bar from 12 yards. That was a really good move. Helmer is the left-sided centre-back but he has been getting forward all night in open play. 55 min Sheringham is dropping deeper and deeper in an attempt to get in the game. Now he appears in the right-back position, flicking a pass into Ince on the halfway line. Ziege slips, which allows Ince to move within 25 yards of goal before cracking a shot over the bar. Ince is starting to dominate the midfield. 53 min Now it\u2019s Germany\u2019s turn. Moller breaks dangerously into space from the halfway line, but Adams holds him up long enough for Ince to make a good recovery tackle. This is a cracking game now. 52 min Germany are being pinned back for the first time in the match. McManaman goes on a nice run down the left, his best of the match so far, before crossing too close to Kopke. 50 min England have been a lot better on the ball since half-time \u2013 quicker, more precise and with much greater purpose. Their aggression without the ball has been much more controlled as well, as Ince demonstrates by appearing from nowhere to pick Scholl\u2019s pocket and start another counter-attack. 48 min A fine sliding tackle by Sammer on McManaman sparks a German break. An even better sliding tackle at the other end of the pitch, from Adams on Moller, ends it. Adams points theatrically at the ball as it goes out for a throw-in. He\u2019s having a brilliant game. 47 min \u201cI think people are getting swept up in the emotion of this too much, of football coming home,\u201d says Neil Connolly. \u201cEngland were poor in two group games, lucky against Spain and they haven\u2019t been great tonight. They\u2019re not a patch on the teams from \u201890 or \u201886.\u201d Those teams had a few iffy performances as well, don\u2019t forget \u2013 Portugal, Morocco, Ireland, Cameroon. 46 min: REUTER IS OUT OF THE FINAL! He\u2019s been booked for pulling back McManaman, who was breaking down the left. It was his second yellow card of the tournament, and a simple decision for the referee Sandor Puhl. 46 min The players are back on, and England begin the second half. A couple of excellent points from the BBC1 panel. Ruud Gullit says England scored too early, while jimmy Hill says they\u2019ve been too hyper. Half time: Germany 1-1 England There\u2019s nothing it in terms of goals or clear chances \u2013 one apiece on both counts \u2013 but Germany have been much the more relaxed, confident side. It really is just another game to these people. They\u2019re animals. 45 min Saying which: Scholl slithers through the midfield, away from Platt and Ince before hitting a shot that is blocked on the edge of the area by Adams. 44 min Out of nothing, England have upped the tempo and are ending the half really strongly. Ince is starting to win more loose balls in midfield. 43 min: JUST WIDE FROM SHEARER! England almost go back in front with an immense header from Shearer. Platt combines well on the right with Anderton, who controls the ball deftly on the run and floats a cross back towards the penalty spot. Shearer, arriving late in the box, leaps imperiously to thump a header that swerves just wide of the far post. Kopke was scrambling across his line, though I\u2019m not certain he\u2019d have got there. As the ball flew wide, Shearer shouted \u201cBAAAA-STARD!\u201d, a bit like Francis Begbie as he set about a hotel room in his white socks at the end of Trainspotting. For extra clarification, Shearer then screamed \u201cFuck off!\u201d to everyone and no one. He put the same feeling into the header. 42 min Now Shearer is penalised for elbowing Babbel. 41 min Seaman makes a routine catch from Ziege\u2019s looping header. 40 min Reuter is flattened again, this time by an aerial challenge from Pearce. That was overzealous at best, and a number of German players run over to ask the referee what the flip is going on. As in almost every game at this tournament, England really need the half-time whistle. They\u2019re in danger of losing the head. 39 min Gascoigne tries to get England going with a hyper-aggressive tackle that sends Reuter up in the air. A bit like Gary Charles in 1991, except this time he took the ball cleanly. But all England have at the moment is physical aggression. They can\u2019t get their passing game going at all. If Jamie Redknapp was fit he would surely come on for David Platt at half-time. 38 min Shearer fouls Kopke, then tells him to get up. As with Freund, Kopke did make the most of it, but it was a foul. England are getting a bit frustrated with the German players - and, I suspect, with themselves. 37 min \u201cIf there was technology to correct offside decisions,\u201d says Niall Mullen, \u201cthen England might already be out after Julio Salinas\u2019 goal was disallowed on Saturday.\u201d Good point. That was a much worse decision. 36 min Sammer swaggers away from Gascoigne in the centre circle to start another Germany move. Eventually Kuntz wafts high over the bar from 25 yards. But that was another lovely piece of play from Sammer, who is running the game. 35 min \u201cHave you mentioned Mcmanaman yet?\u201d says David Gilbert. \u201cIs he even playing?\u201d He hasn\u2019t done much, although the same could be said of all England\u2019s attacking players apart from Shearer and to a lesser extent Anderton. 34 min Sheringham gingerly feels his teeth after wearing the arm of Helmer in his face. It wasn\u2019t deliberate. For a second it looked like Sheringham was going to do some impromptu dentristry, but he seems to be fine. 33 min Scholl drags a shot well wide from 20 yards after a good run through the midfield. Gascoigne has words with him afterwards, though I\u2019ve no idea why. Scholl walks away like he hasn\u2019t heard him. England\u2019s sporadic attempts to bully Germany have generally been ignored. 33 min Ince fouls Freund, who makes the most of it with an elaborate fall. It was a foul, though, and Ince was a bit churlish to ignore Freund\u2019s offer of a handshake. 31 min: OFF THE LINE BY REUTER! Having scored from the old Arsenal near-post corner, England almost do so again from the Spurs near-post corner. This time the same personnel were involved. Anderton curled it towards the edge of the area, where Sheringham twisted his body to crack a shot towards goal. Reuter, who was just starting to come off his position at the near post, booted it clear. I don\u2019t think Kopke would have saved that. Sheringham did really well to get that on the target as the ball was slightly behind him. 30 min Southgate, on the right, lofts an excellent pass into the area for Anderton. His cross is put behind for a corner by Eilts, who has already made a number of important interceptions. 27 min Oof. Adams, the last man, gives the ball straight to Moller on the halfway line - but he redeems his error with a fine lunging tackle. Had he not made that, Moller would probably have been through. I don\u2019t think Pearce or Southgate would have been able to get round. England\u2019s tactics are fascinating, because Adams is the only real centre-half. Although they are tucking in at times, Pearce and Southgate are playing much wider than I expected. 25 min That\u2019s a bit better from England. Platt plays a crisp return pass to Anderton, who dumps a cross into the area from the right. Shearer, running from centre to left, heads over on the stretch from 12 yards. It was an extremely difficult chance, even for a demented goalhungry monster like Shearer. 24 min \u201cDo you think it might be worth thinking about looking into some form of technology for those offside decisions?\u201d says Chris Drew. I can\u2019t see that ever happening to be honest. And actually, nobody in the England team complained about the goal; it was a really tight decision. 23 min The crowd try to rouse the team with a chorus of Football\u2019s Coming Home. Although they have been solid defensively (apart from Pearce\u2019s loss of concentration for the goal), England look so flustered in possession. Can we not knock it? 22 min Sammer, who is nominally a sweeper, is dictating the game. The problem for England is that he appears in so many different positions \u2013 behind the midfield one minute, in front of them the next, then on the right wing. He\u2019s single-handedly reviving the sweeper role. 21 min I thought the goal might spark England\u2019s attack into life. It hasn\u2019t yet; Germany are comfortably the better side at the moment. It\u2019s far too early to panic, so that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. 18 min England have been scruffy in possession so far, and the goal ultimately came from Platt, under no pressure, overrunning the ball near the halfway line. 17 min Hang on, replays show that Helmer was offside when he made the goal! It was a tough one for the linesman, because Helmer was moving away from goal at the time, but he was definitely beyond the defence when Moller played that return pass to him. Pearce was leading the appeals for offside, in fact, which might be why he defended a little dopily when the cross came in. No, it can\u2019t be this straightforward: Germany have equalised with their first chance! It was a very well-worked goal. Reuter, just past the halfway line, moseyed infield from the right and played a square pass to Helmer. He surged into the space, clipped a pass infield to Moller on the edge of the D and kept running. Moller held off Adams and then Gascoigne before playing a nice reverse pass to Helmer \u2013 that\u2019s the centre-back, by the way - on the left side of the area. He turned and hit a speculative low cross that was slid into the net from close range by Kuntz. He came on the blindside of Pearce, who was running in the wrong direction when Kuntz appeared from nowhere to score. Seaman had no chance. 14 min \u201cDid 2Pac have this match in mind when he penned \u2018How Do U Want It\u2019?\u201d cheers Ian Copestake. \u201cLike this, 2 mate, like this!\u201d 13 min It\u2019s an odd thing to say about a team that\u2019s 1-0 up, but England haven\u2019t really settled. They\u2019ve been passive since going ahead. That\u2019s human nature, I suppose, but it means they haven\u2019t yet got their passing game going. 11 min Scholl is late on Pearce, who turns round with gritted-teeth intent before deciding better of it. 10 min That\u2019s a bit more penetrative from Germany. A classy one-touch move, from right to left, ends with Southgate clearing Ziege\u2019s cross. 9 min Germany have dominated possession since the goal, with Sammer involved in everything, but so far all their work has been done in deeper positions. 8 min A thumping man-and-ball challenge from Gascoigne on Reuter. There\u2019s a whiff of 1991 about his frantic start, although his tackles have been more controlled. He hasn\u2019t yet maimed anyone, or himself. 6 min Gazza \u2013 come on, we\u2019re all friends here \u2013 beats Helmer and Sammer on the right edge of the area with some lovely footwork, but his cross to Platt is overhit. 5 min Gascoigne takes a blundering shortcut through the back of Sammer, an overzealous rather than malicious tackle. Sammer accepts the apology. 4 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Luke Richardson. \u201cI am 19, high on 4-1 and I think we\u2019ll remember these barmy nights for a long time. It seems odd to think of an epic occasion in such a compact tournament. It already seems like it\u2019s been on longer than it has and I think that sense of it being the summer of Euro 96 rather than a few short weeks will linger. They couldn\u2019t. Could they?\u201d Of course they bloody could! Whether they will\u2026 4 min It can\u2019t be this straightforward. Can it? England take the lead from the corner! It was the simplest goal, the old Arsenal near-post routine, but with Tony Adams playing the role of Steve Bould. Gascoigne\u2019s flighted corner skimmed off his head at the near post, and the unmarked Shearer \u2013 the unmarked Shearer! - headed it through the legs of Kopke. It\u2019s his fifth goal of the tournament. There was nothing Kopke could do about that \u2013 but he was still at fault for the goal, as it was his typically ostentatious punch that led to the corner. Who cares: England are ahead! 2 min: Kopke saves from Ince! Pearce\u2019s deep cross from the left is headed out by Ziege and bounces up towards Ince, 35 yards from goal. He chests the ball up in the air, runs onto it and pings a dipping volley that is punched over the bar by the flying Kopke. It was a fairly straightforward save \u2013 most keepers would have caught it \u2013 but a cracking effort nonetheless. And it\u2019s got the crowd going again, which is just what England wanted. 1 min Germany kick off, from left to right as we watch on the office TV. Whatever happens in the next couple of hours will live with us until we\u2019re old and doddery. \u201cAs regards schoolboy humour evinced from a German surname,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cthe English should take a hard look at their goalkeeper before casting nasturtiums.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s hope there is now respect for the German anthem,\u201d says Barry Davies, who hasn\u2019t even finished his sentence when the boos start. It\u2019s not as bad as I feared - a few whistles rather than a wall of wewonthewar noise - but it\u2019s still a bit depressing. \u201cThose who felt it necessary to whistle,\u201d says Davies, \u201cwe can leave to their own ignorance.\u201d The players stroll onto the field, ready for the anthems. England\u2019s is to be sung by 80s crooner Paul Young... whose microphone isn\u2019t working. Not that it matters: most of the studio are belting it out, Tony Adams with particular gusto. England have four players on a yellow card: Adams, Southgate, Shearer and Sheringham. Germany have five: Moller, Sammer, Reuter, Ziege, Kuntz. \u201cBefore your anglophone readers get too carried away with Kuntz,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cThe pronunciation of the German forward\u2019s name is actually more like that of American thriller novelist Dean Koontz than the ubiquitous British insult. Sorry to ruin it for everyone. By the way, Koontz launched a new book last year (1995) called Intensity. No, it is not about Stuart Pearce trying to get in his German opponents\u2019 heads.\u201d Des Lynam handed over to Barry Davies for the build-up about 10 minutes. Davies has said almost nothing. He\u2019s just letting the atmosphere sing for itself: first Three Lions, then You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone and now, erm, We Will Rock You. There really is an exultant atmosphere at Wembley. The Beeb have a heavyweight punditry panel. Jimmy Hill, who has his England bowtie on, Ruud Gullit and Alan Hansen. \u201cI think it\u2019s 50/50,\u201d says Hill, and on balance I\u2019d agree. Two minutes ago I was 100 per cent sure England would lose. Now I\u2019m 100 per cent sure they\u2019ll win. It\u2019s coming home! Possibly. The BBC coverage, pushed back because of extra time in the Czech Republic, is underway. \u201cHello again, glad you\u2019ve tuned in,\u201d says Des. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously heard there\u2019s a football match on tonight.\u201d \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cSmall point but I wonder if England will miss Redknapp. He looked really calm &amp; composed (not to mention preternaturally handsome) when he came on against Scotland. I\u2019m not sure if England have anyone else with that sort of control in midfield. Anyway what a glorious evening for football and come on Germany (unless Fowler gets a run).\u201d Yeah, had he been fit I think he\u2019d have started ahead of Platt tonight, and against Spain as well. He\u2019s another one, like Phil Neville, whose time will come. Germany are technically the home side, so England will be playing in their change strip tonight: it\u2019s indigo blue, according to Umbro, but it looks grey to everyone else. I\u2019m not even going to attempt to describe David Seaman\u2019s goalkeeping top. First things first: it wasn\u2019t a bluff, there\u2019s no Jurgen Klinsmann for Germany. That\u2019s an almighty boost to England. Right, Terry Venables makes one change from the win over Spain. Paul Ince, who was missed so badly on Saturday, returns from suspension to replace the newly suspended Gary Neville. The only slight surprise is the inclusion of David Platt ahead of Phil Neville, who most expected to be chosen to replace his brother. That means England will play with three rather than four at the back. Venables has obviously decided that this game is too big for a 19-year-old, even one as precocious as Neville. But his time will come; on the evidence of the last six months, he\u2019s going to be a superstar. The word from Wembley is that Klinsmann has bugger all chance of coming off the bench, even though he will sit among the German substitutes. His replacement is the 33-year-old Stefan Kuntz, who plays for Besiktas in Turkey \u2013 not, as some of you have suggested, for Nominative Determinism FC. Kuntz will play up front of his own. Fredi Bobic, the other striker who started on Sunday, is also injured. The midfielder Steffen Freund comes in for him. Germany have been ravaged by injuries, and two of their seven available substitutes are reserve goalkeepers. Germany (3-4-2-1) Kopke; Babbel, Sammer, Helmer; Reuter, Freund, Eilts, Ziege; Scholl, Moller; Kuntz. Substitutes: Bode, Hassler, Kahn, Schneider, Strunz, Bierhoff, Reck. England (3-1-4-2) Seaman; Southgate, Adams, Pearce; Ince; Anderton, Platt, Gascoigne, McManaman; Shearer, Sheringham. Substitutes: Flowers, Barmby, Campbell, Ferdinand, P Neville, Stone, Fowler, Walker. The Czech Republic are in the Euro 96 final! Their fairytale will continue at Wembley on Sunday! They\u2019ve just beaten France 6-5 on penalties at Old Trafford after a forgettable 0-0 draw. Miroslav Kadlec roofed the winning penalty after Reynald Pedros\u2019s tame penalty was saved. Poor bloke. The Czech Republic are one game away from an astonishing success. But you can\u2019t escape the fact that England would be happy to play them in the final. It was always going to come to this. Come on, did you really think football would be allowed to come home without first getting past the Germans? They\u2019re the Keyser Soze of world football: nine of the last 12 major tournaments involving European teams have been won by the Germans or the team that put them out. And it\u2019ll probably be 10 out of 13 come Sunday evening. Whoever wins at Wembley will go into the final as decent favourites against either France or the Czech Republic. That game is heading for a penalty shoot-out: it\u2019s 0-0 at Old Trafford with a few minutes of extra-time remaining. I was going to say it\u2019s been a stinker, but that would be overly generous. As in 1990, when a bereft Argentina waited in the final for the winners of England and West Germany, this feels like more than a semi-final. England and Germany have been the two best teams in the tournament, even allowing for England\u2019s occasionally obscene good fortune against Spain on Saturday. That win added to an already overwhelming sense of destiny \u2013 and, if we\u2019re being honest, slightly dangerous giddiness - up and down the country. There are two ways of looking at this Germany side. The first is that they are Germany, and Euro 96 was fun while it lasted. The second is that, as German sides go, they aren\u2019t that scary. Their captain Jurgen Klinsmann is a big doubt after limping off with a calf injury against Croatia \u2013 we\u2019ll have team news shortly \u2013 and, for all the brilliance of Andreas Moller and especially the sweeper Matthias Sammer, they aren\u2019t a patch on the awesome power team that won Italia 90. You could have a good pub braw- sorry, debate about whether England\u2019s class of 96 are better than the boys of 1990. This team has one undeniable edge: home advantage. The world has changed a lot since 1966, and upper lips are nowhere near as stiff as they once were. The atmosphere at Wembley tonight will be like nothing we\u2019ve heard before. The euphoria of the last 10 days is such that nobody seems to have considered the possibility England might not win tonight. Nobody is ready for the party to end. Nobody wants to stop fakkin shoutin\u2019 lager, lager, lager. This country is certainly going to have an almighty hangover tomorrow. But let\u2019s be clear about this: there are hangovers, and hangovers. What kind is this to be? Kick off is at 7.30pm on 26 June 1996 (and 24 March 2020)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
