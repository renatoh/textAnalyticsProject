J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side were the victors on that occasion, 2-1 courtesy of an 84th-minute Virgil van Dijk goal on his debut for the club, while Everton won a fourth-round replay 1-0 in 2009 after a 1-1 draw at Anfield. Michael Owen, who scored Liverpool\u2019s two goals in the 2001 FA Cup final win over Arsenal, tweeted: \u201cNo question what the tie of the round is in.\u201d Manchester City, the holders, are at home to Port Vale, while Manchester United travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers, who knocked them out in the sixth round last season. John Rudge, a former Vale manager and now the club\u2019s president, said: \u201cWhat a challenge. It\u2019s fantastic for the players and the crowd to come to Manchester City and play in the third round of the FA Cup. We might have to park the bus a few times. It will help the new owners, who have done well. We will all be looking forward to it.\u201d Leeds are at Arsenal, who have won the cup a record 13 times, in a repeat of the 1972 final won by Leeds. The last two meetings between the clubs were also in the third round. In 2012 Arsenal won 1-0 and they also eliminated Leeds 3-1 in a replay after a 1-1 draw the previous year. AFC Fylde of the National League are at Sheffield United of the Premier League, while Chelsea will face the Championship\u2019s Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge. Boston, who play in the National League North, the sixth tier, will host Premier League Newcastle if they can beat Rochdale in a second-round replay on Tuesday week. Hartlepool of the National League still need to see off Exeter at home to secure a tie at Oxford, while Eastleigh, also from the National League, must win a replay at Crewe to set up a visit from Barnsley. Solihull Moors were beaten 4-3 by Rotherham last night despite leading 3-0 with 28 minutes remaining. The Millers\u2019 reward is a home tie with Hull. Leicester will host Wigan, while Spurs have been drawn away to Middlesbrough of the Championship who are managed by their former defender Jonathan Woodgate. The third-round ties will be played between 3-6 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
