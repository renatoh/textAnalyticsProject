Canada said in April it would remove the families of staff posted to Havana, where Canadian and US diplomats have complained of dizziness, headaches and nausea. The US pulled more than half its embassy staff from Cuba and warned its citizens not to travel to the island, after what it described as \u201csonic attacks\u201d. The diplomats complained that the foreign ministry \u2013 unlike the US state department \u2013 had said very little about the matter in public and did not appear to be making their case a priority. Getting specialized medical care has been difficult, they added. \u201cWe did not expect to be abandoned, or more precisely, sacrificed \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019re feeling now,\u201d the paper quoted one of them as saying. Several of those affected believe Ottawa has said little in public because it wants to maintain friendly relations with Cuba, the Globe added. An official at the Canadian foreign ministry did not respond directly when asked about the diplomats\u2019 complaints that they had been abandoned, but said the situation was very difficult. \u201cIt is really an unprecedented type of incident, which has a lot of uncertainty. Our response to it has evolved since we first became aware of it,\u201d said the official, adding that Ottawa had done its best to make medical care available. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. US and Cuban officials met at the state department in September to discuss the mysterious health problems. The United States has reduced embassy staffing in Cuba from more than 50 to a maximum 18. US officials reportedly believe the health problems may have been caused by sophisticated electromagnetic weapons, but some doctors and scientists have expressed skepticism at the allegation. The Professional Association of Foreign Service Officers (Pafso) \u2013 the union representing rank-and-file diplomats \u2013 said the initial government reaction had been inadequate, in part because no one had experience of such a problem. \u201cEveryone is worried because if you don\u2019t know what something is, and it\u2019s unpredictable, nobody can say for sure that [it] isn\u2019t going to happen again,\u201d the Pafso president, Pamela Isfeld, said in a phone interview. \u201cI totally do not blame them for being very unhappy with this.\u201c Adam Austen, a spokesman for the Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said she was deeply troubled by the health problems the diplomats were experiencing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
