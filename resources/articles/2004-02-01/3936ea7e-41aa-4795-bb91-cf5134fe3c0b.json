Phone: 01792 484848. Website: morganshotels.com. First impressions: Swansea may not be blessed with a trove of architectural treasures but the former Harbour Trust building is one of them. The Victorian grandeur has been modernised with care. It's like Swansea meets LA - and one of the hotel's biggest fans is Catherine Zeta Jones. What are the rooms like? The 20 rooms are named after ships built or registered in the port. In mine - Digby Grande - the high ceiling, wooden floors and original mouldings speak of Victorian prosperity while the leather chairs, suede curtains and plasma screen TV couldn't be more hip. The bed test: I almost needed a chair to get into it. Once there, I could not be moved. The bathroom: Twin sinks, twin showers and a bath large enough for at least two. Scented candles and Molton Brown ginseng gels. The restaurant: The old boardroom has been converted into a fine, airy dining room. I ate scallop and squid nero risotto followed by a fillet of Welsh black beef with a foie gras reduction. Dinner for two costs around \u00a375 including wine. The bar: Large, bright, ringed with leather sofas and full of smart locals. What is there to see within walking distance? Wind Street is a sign of the times: smart bars and restaurants rub walls with the Swansea Labour Club. The Dylan Thomas Centre is a minute away. What is there to see within driving distance? The Gower peninsula was the first place in Britain to be designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the early 1950s. It is all caravans and surf dudes in summer, but quiet in winter. How much a night? From \u00a3100 per room, including a full Welsh breakfast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
