The resulting first-rate documentary, Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains, is a fascinating portrait of a man of true probity; articulate, honest, modest, intelligent and often very funny. The hostility he runs into from some Jewish audiences (most notably in Phoenix where he was the target of crude demonstrations and of abusive rabbis who refused to go on the record) is truly disturbing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
