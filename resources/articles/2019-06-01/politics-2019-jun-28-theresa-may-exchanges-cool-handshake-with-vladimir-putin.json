After exchanging a handshake, during which May appeared stern, the pair held the first half of their 80-minute meeting alone, with only translators in the room. A senior government official confirmed that before the meeting, the prime minister had read a defiant interview with the Russian president in the Financial Times, in which he declared liberalism to be \u201cobsolete\u201d. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, she told Putin: \u201cThe use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour and was a truly despicable act that led to the death of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess.\u201d And she confronted Putin with the fact that the UK had gathered \u201cirrefutable evidence that Russia was behind the attack \u2013 based on painstaking investigations and cooperation with our allies\u201d. \u201cShe said that this behaviour could never be repeated and that the UK wants to see the two individuals responsible brought to justice,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cThe prime minister underlined that we remain open to a different relationship, but for that to happen the Russian government must choose a different path. The prime minister said the UK would continue to unequivocally defend liberal democracy and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people.\u201d The prime minister had insisted before the pair met that Britain\u2019s relationship with Russia could not return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d while the suspects from the Salisbury poisoning remained at large and Moscow continued to carry out disinformation and cyber-attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s not business as usual and it can\u2019t be business as usual with Russia until they stop the sort of acts we have seen them doing around the world,\u201d she told ITV. \u201cWe in the UK have seen the use of a nerve agent, a chemical weapon, on the streets of Salisbury. \u201cBut we see other Russian activity around the world \u2013 we see the use of disinformation, cyber-attacks \u2013 and we need to see Russia desisting from that activity.\u201d The two leaders met after Putin\u2019s FT interview in which he attacked liberalism and made light of the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year. He said: \u201cListen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This [Skripal] spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopeks. Or even \u00a35, for that matter.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Putin said \u201cthe so-called liberal idea\u201d had \u201coutlived its purpose\u201d, and criticised open borders and multiculturalism. He said Russia was taking action against unfettered migration, \u201cwhereas the liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. The migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants must be protected. What rights are these? Every crime must have its punishment.\u201d May also told Putin the UK would \u201ccontinue to unequivocally defend liberal democracy and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people\u201d, in what appeared to be a response to Putin\u2019s uncompromising remarks in the FT interview. Reporters were admitted to the early moments of the meeting between the pair, before leaving the room to allow them to speak \u201cleader to leader\u201d, as the prime minister called it. She looked serious throughout. The widow of Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in London in 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea, said she was disappointed May had agreed to meet Putin. Marina Litvinenko said the prime minster had failed to mention Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun \u2013 the two Russian assassins who had poisoned her husband. Putin has refused to extradite the pair. A UK public inquiry in 2016 found them responsible for Litvinenko\u2019s murder. It said Russia\u2019s president had \u201cprobably\u201d approved the assassination. \u201cMrs May has said nothing about what happened to my husband. He was a British citizen when he died. The two suspects for his murder should be brought to justice.\u201d Earlier, Putin appeared at a press briefing alongside Donald Trump. When asked by a reporter whether he would challenge Putin over interfering in elections, the US president turned to his counterpart, wagged his finger and said: \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election, president.\u201d The pair laughed. May is also meeting the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the two-day summit in Japan. It is one of May\u2019s final outings on the world stage, before she hands over the keys to 10 Downing Street to either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
