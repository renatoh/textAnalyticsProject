But these progressive rock doyens, influenced by blues, prone to instrumental jams and plugged into Britain's folk tradition, are rarely namechecked in interviews. Frontman Ian Anderson might have been a joke after punk for his salmon-farming activities, but here the pie-eyed singer cuts a fairly cool figure, with his black beanie, black jeans and matching boots, white T-shirt and black waistcoat. He's droll, too. \"There's a misconception that we play elaborate, lengthy pieces that bore the shit out of you,\" he says, introducing Nursie. \"Here's a short one that will bore the shit out of you.\" The reference, before the intermission, to the incontinence pants on sale at the merchandise stall gets the lapsed hippies roaring. \"Don't laugh,\" he chides. \"I'm wearing mine now.\" Images of the once-ubiquitous furry freaks circa their 1968-72 heyday appear on the screen behind the stage, and it is shocking to see these wild old men of rock resembling members of Kings of Leon. So Much Trouble, by bluesman Sonny Terry, is dedicated to early Tull champion John Peel. \"He [Terry] was a great harmonica player,\" says Anderson, mouth harp in hand. \"I'm not.\" Lucky Man features the once-cherubic, now plain chubby Greg Lake of prog gods ELP on guitar, while 99 Lives sees guest number two, violinist Anna Phoebe, waft onstage. She arches her back and darts about like a, well, young, female Anderson. The violinist and the flute-parping rou\u00e9 duel on early Tull favourite Bouree like an old fox and his prey, the highlight of a surprisingly entertaining set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
