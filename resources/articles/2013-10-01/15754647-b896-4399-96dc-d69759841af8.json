All credit to Tennant that it is not. He is too good an actor to be a dominating star. He is elusive, as this self-regarding, self-defeating king should be. He is sardonic, light-footed, unpleasant, alluring, completely free of ingratiation and, by the way, not Scots. He is a primary but not the only strand in the rousing triumph of Gregory Doran's staging, his first Shakespeare production since becoming the RSC's artistic director. Doran fires both barrels of Shakespeare's gun, the tragic and the historical. Tennant's mercurial clarity is vital to the play's slippery centre, the melancholy reflectiveness and evocation of royal uncertainty that makes it look like an early shot at Hamlet. He begins preening, skewed on the throne at an angle to everyone. In a court full of bristling near-baldies, he has unnerving long Jesus tresses that he flicks over his shoulders. He becomes skittish, teasing a favourite by placing the crown on his head. He glimmers with white-faced intensity in his dark cell. He is a will-o'-the-wisp. Yet this is also a robust dissection of a corrupt England, an examination of dynasty and decay. It bristles with lickspittles and asset-strippers, with placemen who are ripping off the state's assets. A fine, restrained Michael Pennington gives desperate dignity to John of Gaunt's lush \u2013 sceptred isle and silver sea \u2013 lament for England. The minute the old chap gives up the ghost, minions scamper to grab his coffers and lug them across the stage. The play's long reach and political urgency are projected forcefully in a production that draws on Stratford's traditional strengths. It should be able to pass without comment that Shakespeare is delivered at the RSC with ease, lucidity and rhythm. Well, it has not always been so. Here, though, there are no dud speakers. Emma Hamilton brings a lovely grace to the small, beguiling part of Richard's wife. As the Duke of York, Oliver Ford Davies is radiantly authentic. He delivers many speeches as if he were quietly arguing with himself and the audience were eavesdropping. When he erupts into violent confrontation he is shattering. The erosion of the difference between soliloquy and speech is surely one mark of a great Shakespearean actor. The bustle and business of a court is enjoyably present in a production that features wimples, trumpets and armour, some fairly camp singing and a few ranty bits round the edges: would Nigel Lindsay's terrifyingly brusque Bolingbroke really win hearts to become the people's king? Yet just when you think it is wholly traditional an extraordinary twist appears. The text has been tweaked to accommodate an unexpected homosexual kiss, and an unexpected (that's to say, rewritten) murderer of the king. Both are provocative and both make sense. As does Stephen Brimson Lewis's design. It swims from one semi-abstract CGI grey sketch to another, suggesting that the gaudy business of royalty, the difficulty of a man trying to work out who he is, takes place in a world of indifference. The production will be broadcast live to cinemas around the world on 13 November. The RSC and the National are not the only theatres that are changing artistic directors. Peter Glanville is leaving the Little Angel in north London, where he has been in charge for eight years. This enchanting puppet theatre, set in the Islington equivalent of a glade, has been perfect for shows for children. Glanville has expanded it to take in adult shows, and now that it's boom time for puppets, nasty and appealing, there is surely room to expand the potential of the Little Angel. Meanwhile Glanville's last production is a marvel. It takes a few minutes to get used to it. To see Macbeth as a fighting cock, reddish gold with a cruel, curved beak and a ruffled crest, and Duncan as a mighty swan, his wings stretched out as if to shelter the stage, with a chain of honour around his neck. To see the witches as scrawny vultures. Drawing on the bountiful avian imagery in Macbeth, Glanville has reimagined the play with bird puppets. Moving behind them like magicians \u2013 or witches \u2013 puppeteers Claire Harvey, Lori Hopkins and Lowri James give the characters wing. Glanville's radically cut adaptation goes decisively to the roots of the action: you don't hear the news of the slaughter of the Macduff family but see Macduff's reaction, \"all my pretty chickens\". Those little Macduffs really are chicks, beaks agape, bobbing and chirping in the nest. Until they are covered with a bloodied cloth. Nathaniel Parker's voice makes a rather muffled Macbeth. The vocal star is Helen McCrory who gives Lady Macbeth a powerful whisper that vibrates with menace. In the sleepwalking scene, disease is wrung out of every syllable and she sounds as if she is vomiting the speech. Meanwhile, Lyndie Wright's fiercely sculptural somnambulist puppet bends and sways as if she is being eaten from inside. Other extraordinary moments show a bird slowly drawing its wing across its eyes, and murdered birds being upended, held by their legs to become butcher's poultry. What an exceptional occasion in which fowl is fair.
