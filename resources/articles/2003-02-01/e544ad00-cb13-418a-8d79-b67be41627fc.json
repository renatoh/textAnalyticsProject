Biologists are clear that children are imperiled more by step-parents than blood relatives. What, then, happened to children when the average age of death for the working classes was 22, as it was in the middle of the 19th century? In Jeannie Duckworth's fascinating but flawed new book on child criminals, it is all too clear: in a group of 192 girls, 47 had no parents, 14 had a stepmother, nine a stepfather, 53 had no father, 14 no mother, four didn't know if their parents were alive, while three had parents who were insane. Only one came from a \"respectable\" family. It is not, therefore, surprising to learn that these girls were all in prison. In the 19th century, thousands upon thousands of children, some as young as five or six, foraged for themselves or grouped together in small bands for protection and to prey on the unwary. Lodging houses hired out beds by the night, in rooms with between six and 14 beds down each side. If the 6d a night was beyond reach, two to four children shared a bed, paying a farthing apiece. The rooms had no ventilation, the bed-linen was changed once every six months, whatever the condition of the previous occupant. The children were literally lousy, covered with scabies. On their own from the very youngest ages, they had no sense of right and wrong. They owned nothing, and understood nothing of property: taking things from others was not a daring crime, it was simply a necessity. The \"fortunate\" ones were taken in by thief trainers, who fed and clothed them while they were taught to steal. This might well be the first time these children knew what it was to have enough to eat and a permanent roof over their heads. A lot of them saw jail as preferable to the streets. They were fed, they had beds, they were even taught to read and write: for the first time in their lives, they were looked after. Many were imprisoned for crimes that had clearly been committed in order to be arrested: throwing stones, breaking windows. The main weakness of Fagin's Children is that Duckworth has trouble accepting that life in the 19th century could have been as harsh as it was. She itemises prison meals in a tone of horror and is appalled by this \"meagre fare\". But they were meals that the regularly employed working classes would have been pleased to see. Similarly, she compares the discipline in prisons to today's standards, rather than those prevalent at the time, and does the same with living conditions: Tothill Fields prison, in mid-century, had no water, light or, bathetically, \"anything for summoning the warder\". Prison timetables are expected to shock, but in fact closely resemble those of many public schools. The only difference was that the \"work\" the children performed was picking oakum, sewing bags or other heavy trades. Even in this, reality does not match Duckworth's expectations. One child noted that in the Chelsea workhouse he was expected to pick four pounds of oakum a day, while in prison it was only two - and the food was more plentiful. In general, the historical background that explains the rising crime levels is left unexplored. There is no mention of the epidemics of typhoid and cholera that left children orphaned and destitute; no mention of the famine in Ireland, and successive agricultural depressions that led to rapid urbanisation and the consequent breakdown of family structures. She ignores the Evangelical movement, which did so much to spur on social reform, and one must read half the book before prison reformers are discussed - there is only one mention of Elizabeth Fry. The reform movement, one of the greatest forces for good in the industrial world, is denigrated by the shabby suggestion that it was \"the general fear of the underclass [that] led to an increase in benevolence\". The research is interesting, but without setting it in a larger social context, Duckworth's conclusions cannot hold. \u00b7 Judith Flanders's biography of the Macdonald siblings, A Circle of Sisters, is published by Penguin"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
