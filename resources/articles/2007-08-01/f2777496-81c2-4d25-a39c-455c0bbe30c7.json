The undefeated Manchester light-welterweight will step up to welterweight for the contest for only the second time in his career and will be paid his highest purse, believed to be about $10m (\u00a35m), with the American, who is also unbeaten, understood to be receiving $15m. No venue has been announced but the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino is favourite to get the fight. Oscar De La Hoya's company, Golden Boy Promotions, has put together the deal and Ray Hatton said: \"The contract provided what we wanted and we are officially signed up. Our lawyers have told us the Mayweather camp have also signed. We are just waiting for the date and venue to be made official.\" Hatton's last fight, a fourth-round knockout of the Mexican Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo in Las Vegas in June, received unprecedented support from British fans. Some 8,000-10,000 were estimated to have made the trip and it seems likely more will travel to support Hatton in December. Despite his brilliance, Mayweather cannot match Hatton's ticket-selling prowess but he is a master of the pre-fight hype game. \"He [Hatton] has talked and disrespected me so much in the past months that I can't wait to get him in the ring and show him he is not even on my level,\" he said. \"He's definitely getting knocked out.\" Hatton said: \"To win the world title is one thing but to be known as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet in any weight division would be something else and I just can't wait.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
