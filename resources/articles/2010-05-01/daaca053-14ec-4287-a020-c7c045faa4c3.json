QPR fans have used message boards and forums to discuss staging a repeat of the disturbance that led to their club's players being forced to leave their hotel rooms when the fire alarm went off just before 3am on the day of their Division Two play-off final against Cardiff at the Millennium Stadium in 2003. Neil MacNamara, a Cardiff City supporter and former security guard at the club, later pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage and giving a false alarm of fire at the Celtic Manor hotel in Newport, where he booked in to stay the night before the match. MacNamara was banned from attending football matches for five years after magistrates decided his actions were intended to disrupt QPR's preparations for the game, which Cardiff won 1-0 after extra-time to gain promotion to what is now the Championship. Dave Jones, the Cardiff manager, said yesterday he was aware of the rumours that QPR fans were plotting to cause chaos at the team's hotel in London tonight but he believes there are plans in place to minimise the risk of any revenge attack. \"I wasn't even here [when the incident happened with QPR],\" said Jones, who was Wolverhampton Wanderers' manager at the time. \"I am getting blamed for something else. I don't know why they are setting my alarms off because I wasn't here when it happened. \"But we have security. Would you want to mess around with Don behind you?\" continued the Cardiff manager, pointing to one of the club's security staff, who will be on duty at the team's hotel this evening. \"The hotel we are going to have their own security anyway. \"We have looked into all that. If [the fire alarm] goes off, it goes off. We have taken as much precaution as we would do regardless of whether they said they were going to do it or not. Eventually they will find out where we are staying. \"We have tried to keep it under wraps, as we always do, but if they find out, they find out. I think there is enough security there, though.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
