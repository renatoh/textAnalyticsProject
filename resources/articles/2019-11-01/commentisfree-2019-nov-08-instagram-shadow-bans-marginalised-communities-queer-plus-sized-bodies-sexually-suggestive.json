Instagram has a confusing policy of hiding certain content from its users \u2013 and in the past few weeks, Pxssy Palace (a popular queer arts collective and London club night) has called out the photo-sharing platform for \u201cshadow banning\u201d some of their content. Shadow banning refers to when images aren\u2019t outright removed from the platform, but instead strategically hidden from users. This strategy prevents users from searching shadow-banned hashtags, and removes affected content from Instagram\u2019s Explore page. Despite having over 28,000 followers, Pxssy Palace claims it has recently seen sharp dips in likes, comments and engagement as a result of shadow banning. Bernice Mulenga, a member of the collective, told me that some users can\u2019t comment, like, or even search for their posts, while other posts of partygoers dancing in see-through bodysuits have been taken down altogether. This censorship of queer online communities taking pride in their bodies and sexuality is a huge step backwards: the implication is that people who fall outside traditional body and gender norms should be ashamed of who they are and what they look like. Although it implements these shadow bans quietly (Instagram has only vaguely addressed criticisms, saying it can deprioritise \u201csexually suggestive\u201d images), the practice has become an increasingly regular part of the app\u2019s broader crackdown on what it deems \u201csexual content\u201d. When it comes to nudity online, Instagram purports to have a seemingly straightforward policy. Its community guidelines state: \u201cPhotos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding\u201d are allowed, however, \u201cphotos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks\u201d are not. But what many users don\u2019t know is that beyond the straightforward banning of nude images, Instagram utilises this far murkier form of censorship for content that lies in a grey area it describes as being \u201csexually suggestive\u201d. Salty, an online newsletter and platform for women, trans and non-binary people, released new research last month that looked at the ways that algorithms affect marginalised groups, concluding that plus-sized profiles were often flagged for \u201cexcessive nudity\u201d and \u201csexual solicitation\u201d, and that queer people and women of colour are policed far more than their white, straight, cis counterparts. When images of fully-clothed plus-sized or black women are removed for being \u201cinappropriate\u201d, the platform\u2019s AI learns to adopt biases that reinforce misogyny and racism, creating barriers for certain groups in the digital realm. It is ironic to think that social media, which is frequently framed as an equalising force, serves to suppress communities who are most often discriminated against offline. Non-sexual pictures of queer people, women of colour and plus-sized women, even relatively mundane ones, have been shadow banned \u2013 implying these bodies, clothed or not, are inherently sexual, or something to be hidden from view. In a world that already intensely scrutinises marginalised people\u2019s bodies, pushing back against body-shaming and censorship is important. Shadow bans can also present practical problems for marginalised communities. In the run-up to a recent event, for example, Pxssy Palace noticed their posts were not receiving much engagement and people were unsure if they were even still putting on parties. The shadow ban meant people weren\u2019t seeing their event promotion and were unaware of future events. As someone involved in pole fitness, Instagram\u2019s shadow ban has also placed limits on the work of my own community by shadow-banning pole dance videos and images, or taking down posts altogether. Speaking with pole teachers themselves, I have been told how censorship hinders their ability to promote their work, and thus has a tangible impact on their earning potential. The vagueness of Instagram\u2019s shadow-banning policy is perhaps the most frustrating part. It leaves users confused as to what is and isn\u2019t appropriate, and punishes them in a way that seems indiscriminate, but is inevitably discriminatory. The reluctance to properly define what it means to be \u201csexually suggestive\u201d and a refusal to acknowledge the nuances around it, are unfair. Users who want to utilise their accounts to push cultural boundaries and provide safe, accepting online communities for marginalised groups are being punished without proper consideration. In the process, we give people the illusion of freedom of speech and expression, but only on terms set by predominantly white, straight, male tech guys. How we protect people online and distinguish between content that is pornographic rather than protest, is still up for debate. However, I do know that in the age of fake news floods and far-right forums, body-positive women on social media are not the greatest threat to our safety online. What is Instagram really protecting users from when it censors people\u2019s bodies and sexualities? I know that had women\u2019s bodies in all their glory, shape and size been normalised for me earlier on, I would not have spent so long being ashamed to live confidently in my own. \u2022 Chant\u00e9 Joseph is a social media creative, host and writer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
