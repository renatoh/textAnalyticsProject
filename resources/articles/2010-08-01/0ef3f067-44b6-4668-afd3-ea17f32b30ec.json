By 2031 there will be 1.3 million more Londoners and 750,000 new jobs in the capital. London desperately needs the transport boost that Crossrail delivers to get workers to jobs in the major employment centres of Canary Wharf, the City, the West End and Heathrow. Crossrail will put an additional 1.5 million people, including those in some of our most deprived communities, within one hour's journey of these key destinations. London is the powerhouse of the UK economy and a failure to invest in London is a failure to invest in the UK.
