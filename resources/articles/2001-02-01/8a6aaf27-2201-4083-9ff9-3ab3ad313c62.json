The resignation of their chairman Howard Culley followed. Jewell has been replaced by his highly experienced assistant Peter Shreeves, who will be in charge in a caretaker capacity for tonight's game with their fellow strugglers Tranmere at Hillsborough. Although Shreeves would undoubtedly welcome the chance to return to permanent front-line management, Wednesday will probably seek to install someone with a reputation for turning around seemingly lost causes. Two former managers of their bitter rivals Sheffield United - Dave Bassett and Howard Kendall - may feature on the directors' wish-list. Bassett, football's most celebrated firefighter, is unemployed after recently resigning his post at Barnsley, and Kendall has been out of management for more than two years. Jewell departed pointing an accusing finger at those who guard the Wednesday purse-strings. \"I'm disappointed because, in all honesty, I didn't see this coming,\" he said. \"I was preparing for the home game with Tranmere and working on bringing in a loan player from Southampton, Trond Egil Soltvedt.\" The Norwegian became Peter Shreeves' first signing yesterday on a month's loan. \"Look at the players I was forced to sell last summer,\" Jewell went on. \"In contrast I have barely been given a penny to spend; I have had to rely on kids. \"But I do not regret coming here because I have learned much over the past seven months or so. Obviously it is not nice getting sacked. But I don't think I have been given enough time.\" Culley's decision to stand down in the face of mounting public discontent about his handling of club affairs was not totally unexpected and he hands what must be regarded as a poisoned chalice to one of his directors, Geoff Hulley. \"Given the present position, and in view of the board's decision to terminate the contract of Paul Jewell, I have decided to step aside as chairman,\" he said. \"I did also offer to resign as a director but at the request of the other directors I have agreed to continue temporarily.\" Relegated from the Premiership only last May, Wednesday lie at the foot of the First Division table, two points adrift of safety and having played more games than other clubs in trouble. The final straw for Jewell and Culley came on Saturday when the team were humbled 4-1 away by Wimbledon. Yesterday's developments came 72 hours after Culley had indicated his determination to extend a tenure which began less than 12 months ago after his predecessor Dave Richards took up the post of chairman of the Premier League. Another director, the nightclub and casino owner Dave Allen, has agreed to buy a 36% stake in the club from the venture capital arm of the leading investment bank Charterhouse. Allen is believed to have paid about \u00a34m in a deal which values the club - who have estimated debts of \u00a316m - at \u00a311m . Newcastle are poised to complete a \u00a31m deal for the Sheffield United full-back Wayne Quinn after a month's loan at St James' Park. The move is expected to be rubberstamped in the next 24 hours. Leicester have announced a \u00a32.5m two-year sponsorship deal which could be worth up to \u00a37m with on-field incentives. The deal with the information technology electronics manufacturer LG Electronics will commence in June and the Foxes will kick off next season in shirts bearing the LG logo. \u0095 G\u00e9rard Houllier is resigned to facing Roma without Steven Gerrard and knows he may have to give up on several other Liverpool casualties for Thursday night's Uefa Cup tie. Gerrard, 20, is struggling with the groin injury sustained at Sunderland on Saturday, and his fellow midfielder Igor Biscan will be unavailable too. \"Steven is definitely out, and Igor Biscan is cup-tied after playing for Dinamo Zagreb in Europe,\" said Houllier. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
