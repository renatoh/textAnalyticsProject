Froome crashed into a wall at 37mph in the French town of Roanne last Wednesday, leaving him with multiple broken bones including a fractured neck, a fractured right femur, a broken hip and fractured ribs. Thomas, who will lead Team Ineos into the Tour de France in Froome\u2019s absence, said the accident \u201ccould have been a hell of a lot worse\u201d and admitted the absence of the 34-year-old will be a \u201cbig blow\u201d to the team. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s never nice to hear, especially when it\u2019s a close friend. It sounds horrific really,\u201d Thomas told the BBC. \u201cIt sounds like he was lucky to come away with the damage he\u2019s done. It could\u2019ve been a hell of a lot worse, which I guess is a positive in a bad scenario. \u201cHe\u2019s got the best care around him so hopefully he can get back on the bike soon. I\u2019ve sent him a couple of messages but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a few to get through. The whole team\u2019s behind him.\u201d Last year Thomas became the third Briton, after Bradley Wiggins and Froome, to win the Tour de France. The question of who would lead the new Team Ineos into this year\u2019s race was subsequently a hot topic \u2013 now rendered academic by Froome\u2019s injuries. Thomas said he is excited to be taking charge, though he accepts the team face challenges if they are to succeed. \u201cEvery interview I\u2019ve done this year, they\u2019ve asked about [team leadership]. That\u2019s one thing everyone can stop asking me now. Being the leader of the team, I\u2019ve led the team numerous times now and I\u2019ve got used to that role. We\u2019ve got Egan [Bernal] as well, who\u2019s going to be there by my side, so it\u2019s going to be exciting. \u201cWhen it comes to the actual race, [Froome] is one of the greatest Grand Tour riders ever, so not having him in the team is a big blow. It gives us one less option when it comes to the last few kilometres of the big mountain stages but that\u2019s sport and you\u2019ve got to deal with it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a strong squad anyway and whoever comes in, OK they\u2019re not Chris Froome but they\u2019ll still add to the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
