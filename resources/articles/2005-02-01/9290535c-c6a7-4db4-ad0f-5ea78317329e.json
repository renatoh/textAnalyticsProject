One has lost a leg, another has had a chunk bitten out of his neck, a third is merely a skeleton. But this is a whodunit with a difference because none of the characters are human. Animal Crime Scene is the BBC's latest wildlife venture - an animal documentary meets drama meets murder mystery. Welcome to the new face of Britain's wildlife programming. Set to come out in late summer, this forensic series of five programmes narrated by David Attenborough, is just one example of the BBC natural history unit's shift into more off-beat projects to help it adapt to future budget cuts. The programme makers in Bristol - the world's capital for wildlife television - even teamed up with Mal Young, when he was chief of the BBC's grittiest soap-operas including EastEnders. The idea is to inject drama into wildlife, giving animals characters and turning series into soap operas with running themes and cliff-hangers. 'We are being more experimental,' said Mike Gunton, Director of Development at the BBC's natural history unit. 'We are combining different genres such as science, natural history and culture to produce something fresh and exciting.' But some in the industry believe the shift may mark the end of the traditional, educational documentaries that saw Attenborough head into the depths of the jungle. They say such conventional shows will inevitably decline and be replaced with wackier alternatives, particularly as the corporation is set to make budget cuts and the industry as a whole is shrinking. One programme maker who recently left the BBC's natural history unit said: 'The department is going to face big cuts in the future. There are quite a lot of people still working there but because of the new quota of programmes they have to commission from outside the department that will change. The unit is trying to secure its own future and so has to change direction. Although [the staple documentaries] have loyal viewers they still have relatively small audiences.' He added that although Planet Earth, the sequel to Blue Planet is set to air next year, in future documentaries in the traditional format may be threatened. 'It is quite ironic,' he said, 'because those programmes are always held up as the perfect piece of public programming.' But Gunton said the shift would not mark the end for such programmes: 'It is not a move away from those shows, it is a broadening of the palette. Planet Earth will allow us to really push the boundaries in terms of technologies and techniques and these new style shows are simply another way we can push the boundaries of story-telling.' Planet Earth has reportedly cost the BBC \u00a31.3m per hour, and \u00a313m in all. 'The BBC will probably spend a fortune on promotion and I am sure it will be successful,' said Brian Leith, head of Granada Wild, another wildlife production unit in Bristol. 'But the question that will be asked of it will be whether for that total cost, it is going to get that many more viewers that another drama series that cost the same would - it is an awful lot of money.' Leith added that Granada Wild was also shifting towards more innovative forms of programming with a new series called Deep Jungle with novel techniques that see scientists make new discoveries on air. 'We are getting away from the traditional blue chip format,' said Leith. 'What is clear is that even if a series like Planet Earth is extremely successful, if you come down a notch in expense these traditional style documentaries are not cutting the mustard - so everyone is having to go out in fresh directions.' He said the fact that David Attenborough, the doyen of traditionally formatted documentaries, would be narrating Animal Crime Scene, was a sign that the BBC was also moving on. Animal Crime Scene will see five programmes each with a different victim including a green turtle, a kangaroo and a young reindeer. It will cut between scenes in a forensics laboratory, footage in the wild and archive film. 'It is a like a wildlife CSI - what would happen if you treat an animal's death like a human's,' said series producer, Hilary Jeffkins. It will attract new people who may otherwise find natural history a bit boring.' The BBC will also increase the number of 'diary' programmes, such as the extremely successful Big Cat Diary, that follow the lives of characters over a set period. To some independent companies that have always faced lower budgets, quirky programme styles are essential. 'The BBC have always made brilliant films about animals,' said Andrew Jackson, managing director of Tigress Productions, a Bristol based specialist factual independent. 'We like to think we make brilliant films that just happen to have animals in them. We hire filmmaker's not natural history experts. If a broadcaster does not have much wildlife then we need to find something that will satisfy them and we do that by making shows more about entertainment than education.' Jackson said the industry had been shrinking and new imaginative formats were necessary to maintain audience numbers. But like others he still considered Bristol to be the centre of the world for such programming. He added that even with cuts, the BBC budgets would remain strong: 'They are cutting from such an enormous high. What they consider low budget, we consider well funded. The BBC produces wonderful world-renowned wildlife. I hope it is not inevitable that the staple documentaries will disappear - one fantastic thing about the BBC is that it is still held up in world as benchmark and it would be a shame if they pulled the benchmark down.' Neil Nightingale, the head of the BBC natural history unit said this would not happen: 'We have a huge commitment to natural history programmes and audiences will continue to see them in the same volume.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
