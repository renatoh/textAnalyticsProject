Protests are expected today in the capital Baku, the opposition claiming it would muster 30,000 people. The Azadlyg opposition bloc, which got six seats, has demanded that the government overturn the results. The ruling YAP party said it had a \"convincing victory\", which gave the government at least 100 loyal MPs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
