British troops left Iraq in April and were seen rarely for two years before that. To most Iraqis their legacy is far less significant than that of the US troops who continue to occupy the country almost seven years after the 2003 invasion. A straw poll in Baghdad revealed all to be puzzled as to why Britain would want to comb through the minutiae of its involvement in the invasion. \"I don't care about their inquiry, and nor do any of us,\" said Jabar Hilal, 32, a Basra local now working in a Baghdad bread shop. \"Have they been asleep for six years after the invasion? Why are they holding this now \u2013 clearly for domestic political reasons. They have elections coming up and the Conservatives want to pressure Labour.\" A Baghdad designer, Qusay Awi, 24, also believed the inquiry was needlessly stirring the ghosts of an infamous past, which he claimed had brought Iraq little: an outcome that would not be changed by the hearing's eventual findings. \"They dealt with us differently to the Americans,\" he said. \"They knew our tribes and they knew our history and in some ways they stayed for Iraq's benefit and then left. But whatever the outcome, why bring it up again? We've all moved on.\" Amar Ghanem, 33, a civil servant from the Jadriyah district of Baghdad, was more critical. \"We regard them as invaders,\" he said. \"They came here on false and empty promises and they took Iraq, especially the south, from bad to worse. We thought they might bring investment here when they leave, but so far nothing.\" Britain did leave behind some supporters, one of them Muhammad Falhi, 30, an Iraqi army officer, who received weapons training from British units in the south. He said: \"We have a long history with them and they show us a lot more respect than the other invaders. We're happy to be diplomatic partners now. But as for the inquiry, it's their business. It's going to do nothing to help us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
