Gary Stevens, the American Hall of Fame jockey, winner of three Kentucky Derbies, youngest rider in history to reach the $100m (\u00a365m) mark in prize-money, is over here for one last crack at Royal Ascot before kissing the saddle goodbye and seeking to develop his fledgling movie career. The Americans may not have as much racing history as the British but their jockeys certainly have good manners. Just as the much missed Steve Cauthen came over to charm us two decades ago, the stylish Stevens - who in a previous spell here rode 42 winners as first jockey to Sir Michael Stoute and had three Royal Ascot triumphs in the late 1990s - is a PR man's dream. \"This meeting is the ultimate,\" said Stevens yesterday. \"There is no quarter asked or given by your jockeys - I know all of the top ones - though I am well able to look after myself.\" The 40-year-old Idaho-born \"Cat from Caldwell\" will be flying home at the weekend to prepare for the launch of the film he stars in based on Laura Hillenbrand's award-winning book about the great Seabiscuit, another all-time racing hero from across the Atlantic. But first Stevens hopes to make a dramatic exit by giving a couple of master classes in how to ride Ascot, something he showed with victories for Godolphin on Predappio in the Hardwicke Stakes and Cape Cross in the Queen Anne Stakes. There is another Royal Ascot memory which he particularly cherishes. \"The recollection of winning the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes in the Queen's colours on Blueprint, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, in 1999 will stay with me forever,\" Stevens said. \"Not many American jocks can beat that one. My advice to any young rider has always been 'Never stop dreaming' and there can't be many more dreams to top that.\" Stevens has always had something of a love affair with England, even flying the flag on behalf of the Californian-based British trainer Michael Dickinson, an old friend whose Da Hoss he rode to win the Breeders' Cup Mile seven years ago. His first ride today should give him ample scope to show off his horsemanship when he partners Elusive City, who has shown himself to be a bit of a monkey in the past, for Gerard Butler in the five-furlongs King's Stand Stakes. This colt clearly has the ability to win today but has had a chequered career, having two races taken away from him following dope test failures as a juvenile before winning the Prix Morny at Deauville and finishing third in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket. Back down in trip now after two failures over seven furlongs and a mile, Elusive City has proved troublesome before his races and recently had a stalls test at Lingfield. But Stevens knows all the tricks a racehorse can get up to and should bring the best out of this one. Tomorrow Stevens is set to ride America America for the Florida-based French trainer Franck Mourier (in the Queen Mary Stakes), Paolini, the German runner in the Prince of Wales' Stakes, and Kristensen for Don Eddy in the long-distance Ascot Stakes. Thursday sees Stevens on Dust Cover for Peter Makin in the Hampton Court Stakes, and his agent Terry Norman was still fielding calls about other prospective mounts yesterday. Whatever happens, the world's most stylish race meeting is about to see its last of a very winning Yank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
