The Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in \u2019t Veld, who is leading the European parliament\u2019s emergency fact-finding mission to Malta, said she was \u201cnot reassured\u201d after meeting Joseph Muscat and his justice minister, Owen Bonnici. \u201cI think everybody recognises, including the prime minister himself, that he has made some serious errors of judgment and I would say that staying on longer than necessary is another error of judgment,\u201d she told reporters in Valleta. She said trust between the EU and Malta had been seriously damaged, and that Muscat had done little to allay concerns. The main opposition party said on Monday it would boycott parliament until Muscat left office. A small crowd of protesters threw eggs and insults at both Muscat and Bonnici as they arrived at government headquarters for Tuesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThe EU must put pressure on him to go,\u201d said Caruana Galizia\u2019s sister, Mandy Mallia, who took part in the demonstration. \u201c[Yorgen] Fenech wasn\u2019t acting alone.\u201d Separately, Matthew Caruana Galizia, one of the journalist\u2019s three sons, described the EU\u2019s response to the scandal as \u201ca huge letdown\u201d, although he focused his criticism at the European commission, which is responsible for upholding European law, rather than MEPs. \u201cThere has been pressure from the European parliament, but the response from the European Union has been hopeless, it has just been a huge let down,\u201d he told the Guardian. At a valedictory press conference on his last day in office as European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker declined to comment on the situation in Malta, claiming he didn\u2019t have the details. Juncker said he was \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the rule of law in more than one EU country without going into specifics. Matthew Caruana Galizia cited this as an example of the commission\u2019s \u201cabysmal\u201d approach to Malta, adding he expected more from Juncker\u2019s successor, Ursula von der Leyen, who took office on Sunday. \u201cI expect them to come down like a tonne of bricks, especially after Juncker\u2019s failures. He was abysmal.\u201d The Maltese political crisis is an early test for Von der Leyen, who is under pressure to show that she will not allow EU member states to undermine the rule of law. The commission has called on Malta to establish an independent public prosecutor, after experts at the Council of Europe raised a red flag about the separation of powers. That issue was discussed in a phone call between European commission vice president V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Bonnici on Monday, while Jourov\u00e1 told an FT conference that failure to implement judicial reforms could trigger an EU sanctions procedure, known as article 7. During the call Jourov\u00e1 also said that the Caruana Galizia murder investigation had \u201cto be brought to a conclusion without any political interference\u201d a commission spokesman said on Tuesday. Muscat has promised to stand down in mid-January to allow the Labour party time to pick a new leader. The Caruana Galizia family have called for an investigation into Muscat\u2019s role after investigators alleged there were links between his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the man accused of organising the murder. Schembri resigned last week and was then arrested and later released from police custody without charge. He is alleged to have links with Fenech, Malta\u2019s richest man, who has been charged with complicity in the murder. Konrad Mizzi, who had been accused by Caruana Galizia of corruption, also quit his post as Malta\u2019s tourism minister last week. Muscat, Schembri, Fenech and Mizzi all deny wrongdoing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
