Well, partly it\u2019s because he makes so much of it. Last year, Andrew Vicari sold \u00a317m worth of paintings to a Saudi prince. This year, he sold the last of his series of paintings of the Gulf war to a Riyadh-based firm for \u00a320m. According to last week\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List, that makes Vicari the 18th-richest living Briton - one place behind Paul McCartney and one place above actor Anthony Hopkins. In the spring, the Sunday Express\u2019s Real Rich List had him at number five, between the Duke of Westminster (owner of great swathes of prime British real estate) at four and Ringo Starr (Beatles\u2019 drummer and latterly the lucrative voice of Thomas the Tank Engine) at six. Unlike these rivals in wealth, though, Vicari is practically unknown in his homeland. No matter for us insular Britons that in China they hold loving retrospectives of his work. Or that there are three museums devoted to his oeuvre in Saudi Arabia. Or that Iranian mullahs were so furious about his Gulf war paintings that they wanted to pay Vicari \u00a35m to destroy them. Or that Vicari is the official painter for Interpol and the CRS, France\u2019s much-hated elite police force. Or that he numbers former subjects as varied as Vladimir Putin and Jonathan Aitken as close friends. No matter at all. In Britain, if you get out the cuttings file on this French-based Welshman the vast majority of stories begin \u201cBritain\u2019s least-known but highest-paid painter Andrew Vicari...\u201d He doesn\u2019t get a mention in Who\u2019s Who. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they say I\u2019m unknown. I\u2019m very gregarious. I know everybody. When I was a student at the Slade [the school of fine art in London], Francis Bacon was my mentor. He would try to seduce me because I was very handsome in those days. Every time I used to see him he couldn\u2019t resist a little touch on the knee. I used to laugh him off. I knew Stephen Spender and David Sylvester. I knew Sartre. Truman Capote lived next door to me in Rome. I went round to borrow some milk from him. He came to the door in a baby-doll nightie. He said: \u2018I\u2019ll see.\u2019 Jean Genet was behind him with an Irish setter. I knew Orson Welles. Jonathan Aitken I\u2019ve known since we were members of the squash club at the MCC decades ago. You couldn\u2019t meet a more honest man. I\u2019ve known everybody and everybody knows me.\u201d Vicari, unattached and 63, takes another well-earned sip. We\u2019re sitting in the panelled bar of the Connaught Hotel in Mayfair. It\u2019s a place where fawning waiters meticulously monitor the impressive range of nibbles at each table and bring the bill for your drinks in a leather-bound folder. \u201cI may well be the world\u2019s most highly paid artist, you know,\u201d says Vicari, not boastfully but with an ironic grin. \u201cI love being rich, but it hasn\u2019t changed me at all.\u201d This is not strictly true. He was born in obscurity in the steel town of Port Talbot to Italian parents. His father was a restaurateur, his grandfather a clown. Now Vicari has a luxury apartment in Riyadh, a penthouse near Monte Carlo and a one-acre studio near Nice, where he paints as many as 150 canvases at a time. Forget about Tom Jones, Ryan Giggs, Catherine Zeta-Jones or Shirley Bassey: Vicari is the richest living Welsh person. He is just about to buy a villa near Cannes once owned by a great 20th-century artist whose name he would prefer me not to disclose. Suffice to say the place used to belong to a small Spanish man who had several periods during his career. First name might have been Pablo. He is, by his own admission, \u201cthe last oil painter in the line of Goya, Rubens, Velazquez and Raphael\u201d. One of his favourite stories is about a letter that was simply addressed \u201cThe King of Painters, Monaco\u201d. It reached him. \u201cI am the king of painters,\u201d says Vicari playfully. \u201cAnd, ever since 1974, when I became the official painter to the Saudi court, I have been the painter of kings.\u201d Vicari first came to public notice aged 12, when the Neath grammar-school boy won the gold medal at the Welsh national eisteddfod for painting. \u201cI had wonderful art teachers from whom I learned a great deal. But I had a lot of talent - I was the youngest pupil at the Slade for 50 years, you know.\u201d It was at the Slade where Vicari says he was discovered by his mentor Francis Bacon. Lucian Freud and Sir William Coldstream taught and encouraged him as a painter. \u201cThey were great days and that was a great period for the Slade,\u201d says Vicari. His contemporaries included Euan Uglow, Michael Andrews and Craigie Aitcheson. \u201cThere are no artists of that calibre now,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s that dotty young British artist called?\u201d \u201cDamien Hirst?\u201d \u201cExactly. I wish him well, but what we really need now is a very young person to point out that all this is emperor\u2019s new clothes. It\u2019s the bearded lady approach. All these Brit Art folk are like voyeurs contemplating a copulating couple and not quite understanding what it means. There are only two British painters I care about - Stanley Spencer and Lowry, and Lowry was really an arthritic painter. There is no craftsmanship any more. \u201cThe two devils who are responsible for this are Nicholas Serota [director of the Tate] and Charles Saatchi. They should be executed for what they have done to British art. The Turner prize? Every year our greatest painter\u2019s name is sullied by that award.\u201d As a Slade student and Soho boho in the late 50s and early 60s, Vicari established himself as a portraitist. He painted celebrities as varied as Augustus John and Norman Wisdom. In his later career, his subjects have included French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Mao Tse-Tung, Sophia Loren and Prince Rainier of Monaco. As his reputation grew, so did his bank balance. But his earnings really took off when he started working in Saudi Arabia. How did you become the official painter to the Saudi court? \u201cIt was 1974. I got on a plane for a long flight and all they had to drink was orange juice. I said, \u2018I\u2019m not bloody drinking orange juice all the way to Rio.\u2019 And this guy pipes up, \u2018We\u2019re not going to Rio. We\u2019re going to Riyadh.\u2019 I arrived by mistake.\u201d It is, to be sure, a raconteur\u2019s story and one that, even if true, does not have the ring of truth to it. None the less, Vicari has flourished artistically and financially during his decades of painting in the Saudi capital. \u201cAs Toledo was to El Greco, as Arles was to Van Gogh, Riyadh is to me. In my first paintings, you could see the sun struggling to get through. It glows in my Saudi paintings. I make the oil paint shine.\u201d Vicari, whatever one may think of his work, undeniably revolutionised painting in one part of the Arab world. \u201cFor 14 centuries portrait painting was prohibited in official Islamic art. I changed all that. I was encouraged to paint portraits of leading figures in the court. Initially, I was told that in Islam, if you paint a man\u2019s portrait, you take his soul. And that is still what a lot of Shi\u2019ite Muslims believe. They say they are following the teachings of the Koran. But the Saudis told me, \u2018We will change that popular misconception.\u2019 And, for the first time since the era of the prophet Mohammed, there was figurative art being made officially in Arabia. By me.\u201d Over five years he painted 60 works for a series called the Triumph of the Bedouin, commissioned by the king and government of Saudi Arabia and which is now hung in the King Faisal conference centre in Riyadh. His long relationship with the Saudi state came to a head in 1991, when he was commissioned to work as a war artist. \u201cI left Paris for Riyadh on January 15 1991, the day before the ultimatum given to Iraq. Then I went to the battlefront. It was an amazing experience. What artist would not want to paint a war? \u201cDuring the Gulf war we had a fabulous time. I met Norman Schwarzkopf and Peter de la Billiere [the British general], who became friends. The war brought out the best in people. When I was in Riyadh we used to watch the Scuds come flying. My relations back in Wales received the uncensored version of CNN that we couldn\u2019t receive in Riyadh, so they would call me up and say, \u2018Look out, there\u2019s a Scud heading your way.\u2019 We had no idea. But we had a great time - I remember getting very drunk on tequila one night with the Mexican ambassador as the missiles came in.\u201d Vicari called the 225 resulting oil paintings that depict war scenes, Stealth bombers, surface-to-air missiles as well as portraits of allied leaders, From War to Peace in the Gulf: The Liberation of Kuwait. Many of them are 35ft high. General Schwarzkopf liked his portrait so much that he gave Vicari his camouflage baseball cap, which the artist often wears when he is painting. Would you like to do more war painting? \u201cI\u2019ve done my War and Peace. Now I just do my Anna Kareninas and Kreutzer Sonatas.\u201d What if President Bush gave you the call and asked you to be a war painter in Afghanistan. \u201cI\u2019d have to tell him to get stuffed.\u201d What about Bin Laden? \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I have painted many things for money, but I am not ashamed of anything I have done as a painter.\u201d Instead, Vicari is now painting a series called the Genesis of the Arabian Horse. \u201cHorses always figure in my work as the life force. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s the same with Marianne. I keep painting the figure of Marianne, that beautiful enigmatic woman who symbolises France. I can\u2019t explain why.\u201d He did one of Marianne in 1981, in which her patriotic blue sash cleaves her ample bosom and sweeps behind her in a curl that feeds into a glowering red sun. Vicari\u2019s Gulf war paintings, though, dominated his past decade. They were a lucrative, but stressful business. \u201cThe paint alone cost \u00a3150,000 and the brushes cost a fortune. I was painting 150 canvases at the same time. All great painters have worked like this. Rubens did but I, like an idiot, didn\u2019t have the assistants he did. All my paintings, which are huge, I do myself. The paintings were on panels specially designed in Marseilles made of marine wood with steel supports. They were very expensive to build.\u201d But Prince Khaled bin Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz, Saudi commander of the joint forces during the Gulf war, who had asked Vicari to record the oil conflict in oils, lost interest in the project as costs spiralled. In 1992, the prince took seven portraits of his family, told Vicari he didn\u2019t want the others and compensated the artist with a payment of several million dollars. Worse was to come for Vicari. He had to hire bodyguards to protect himself from Iraqi sympathisers who wanted to kill him for his allegedly pro-Allied depiction of the war. In 1997, he was contacted by some Japanese businessmen who relayed to him an offer from Tehran to buy the entire collection for \u00a35m. What happened? \u201cI can\u2019t talk about that time. Not now. It was too painful.\u201d It turns out that Iran\u2019s mullahs, angered that Vicari had painted pictures of leading Saudi royals as part of the Gulf war sequence in contravention of the teachings of the Koran, wanted to buy the collection to destroy it. When he found out why the Iranians wanted the collection, Vicari turned them down. \u201cBurning the paintings would, for me, be the same as someone having an image of me and then sticking pins in it.\u201d For years afterwards he kept the collection at huge expense in a derelict factory in the hills above Monaco, with around-the-clock security. Last year, though, Prince Khaled changed his mind and paid Vicari \u00a317m for 125 pictures from the collection, which have been housed in a special gallery in Riyadh that serves as a memorial to the Gulf war. Vicari finishes his champagne and insists that we go clubbing together. A 30-second cab ride later and we are in the East India Club on St James Square. Founded by Clive of India , it has a smoking room that is bigger than an out-of-town Tesco\u2019s and a restaurant for women, who are not yet allowed to be members. \u201cI stay at this club when I\u2019m in London. You know why? Because it\u2019s guarded. It\u2019s not guarded by guards but by the fact that you have to put a tie on, and any sort of assassin isn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d Even the scruff from the Guardian has to obey this code: with a blazer from reception and a matching tie and shirt courtesy of the generous Vicari, I am ready to adorn the bar\u2019s sofas and await the arrival of Mr and Mrs Tony Lewis, Welsh friends to the painter. By the time they arrive, more champagne has been drunk. There then follows a scene of Taff reminiscing, which, by rights, should have figured in Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Old Devils . The delightful Mrs Lewis relates how, in the late 40s, Neath schoolgirls would drive the likes of Vicari and her husband wild with their three-quarter-length socks, gym slips and cunning deployment of Max Factor powder puffs. A shudder of desire, half a century old, passes through the assembled Welshmen. After the Lewis party leave, we go to Vicari\u2019s room at the East India Club. In a corner, there is an easel holding Vicari\u2019s latest work in progress, an oil painting of a sad horse\u2019s head. He signs a book for me called Les Motards de la Police, which contains sumptuous reproductions of his paintings commemorating the hitherto unsung work of the French motorcycle police. Do you enjoy your work? \u201cAll I can say is that when I am painting and the life force is coming out of my finger tips, it is better than any orgasm. But my life is an agony, an agony that I will never be able to do it again. The best paintings are in my head.\u201d Do you enjoy the money? \u201cOf course I do. I am not very British in that I am not ashamed of being rich.\u201d What do you do when you aren\u2019t painting? \u201cI drink.\u201d When are we going to see a retrospective of Britain\u2019s richest artist in Britain? \u201cWho knows? Do you know I was the fourth occidental artist to be exhibited in China? After Rodin, Miro and Chagall, there was Vicari. I am one of the great figurative artists, one of the best draughtsmen. Why should I give a toss about what they think of me in this insular country?\u201d \u00b7 Reproductions of Vicari\u2019s work can be seen on his newly launched website: www.andrewvicari.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
