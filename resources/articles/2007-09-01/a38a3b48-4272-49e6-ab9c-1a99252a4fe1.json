Thames Water said the fines were \"totally disproportionate\" and would have a detrimental effect on customers. \"We can see no justification for the level of the fines proposed,\" said Thames Water's chief executive, David Owens. \"This large sum of money could be spent directly on improving services.\" Graeme Wearden AstraZeneca announces successor to Symonds The drugmaker AstraZeneca named Simon Lowth, a former Scottish Power executive, as its new chief financial officer yesterday.

AstraZeneca's chairman, Louis Schweitzer, said Mr Lowth had contributed to \"significant improvements in business and financial performance\" at Scottish Power. Associated Press Postal union calls two 48-hour strikes Postal workers' leaders yesterday announced two 48-hour strikes which will cripple deliveries. The Communication Workers Union said its members will walk out at noon next Thursday and again from 3am the following Monday. The action means there will be no collections or delivery of post for at least five days. The union has already staged a series of strikes this summer in protest at the Royal Mail's pay offer of a 2.5% increase, as well as the organisation's modernisation plans, which the union says would lead to 40,000 job losses. Talks are expected to be held over the weekend. Press Association"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
