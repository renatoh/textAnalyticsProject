From Caen Airport, take a taxi direct to Bayeux (40 to 50 euros). This takes under 15 minutes and is far simpler than getting the slow and infrequent shuttle bus in the opposite direction to the centre of Caen, then catching an even less frequent train to go all the way back. Taxis have to be called via the Air France/information desk in the tiny airport, but you can easily do this while waiting for your luggage to be unloaded. In Bayeux, the Reine Mathilde is a delightful two-star hotel within a few minutes walk from the Tapestry. C. Hicks \u00b7 The obvious way to visit Bayeux without a car is on a bicycle. 20 years ago I arrived in Bayeux with my family, on bikes. We had had such a glorious time cycling through Normandy that we went home and formed a cycling holiday company, Cycling for Softies. Our holidaymakers can still visit Bayeux by booking an Adventurer holiday. We provide the bikes, the maps, and backup. The at the start and finish of the holiday you are booked into the three-star Hotel du Commerce at Vaiges. Prices are from \u00a3270. Tel 0161 248 8282 Susi Madron \u00b7 The best way to travel to Bayeux without using a car is to travel by bicycle. You can catch the ferry from Portsmouth to Ouistreham and then pedal along the coast reaching Bayeux via Arromanches. To make a great holiday for a couple of days I would recommend staying in Bayeux and then Caen returning to the ferry via the very level and easy canal which connects Caen with the coast. A special recommendation is the Hotel Normandie in Ouistreham for lunch before the ferry. It is a great experience with a wonderful menu at moderate prices. Michael Fuller \u00b7 Marion Reynolds asked how she could go to Bayeux without taking a car. She could come with me next May. I shall be running a day-course on the tapestry in Bristol on March 16 2002, and a trip by ferry and with a coach on May 6-10 2002. I will put her on the mailing list if she would like to send her address. Michael Costen \u00b7 Why travel to France when you can see a faithful replica of the 70m tapestry made by 35 skilled Victorian embroiderers in 1885 in Reading museum (0118 939 9800)? Or, if you must, travel to Caen by ferry from Portsmouth and catch the train a few stops to Bayeux from there. Dave Bell \u00b7 Take a Brittany ferry from Portsmouth to Caen (Ouistreham). Catch bus No 1 to Caen. Catch a train from Caen to Bayeux or, alternatively, catch bus No 30. I would advise either travelling overnight on the ferry or getting a day cabin. Their lounge seats, although large, are much more uncomfortable than any airline seat! The Rough Guide to Brittany and Normandy is helpful. Peter Brown \u00b7 Take your car as far as the channel, leave it in secure parking near the docks, and cross as a foot passenger with bike (either Poole-Cherbourg, or Potsmouth-Ouistreham (Caen)). France has an excellent network of small lanes for cycling and the traffic is much more aware and tolerant of cyclists than here. Bayeux, and much more of Normandy, is within easy reach. Jon Gambles \u00b7 The Portsmoth - Caen ferry actually docks at the seaside town of Ouistreham. From here you can get a bus into Caen and then onwards to Bayeux. On the trip into Caen you pass the cafe which was the 'first building on mainland Europe liberated in by the allies in 1944'. Caen Office de Tourisme is on 00 (33) 02 31 27 14 14. Alastair Clark \u00b7 The Bayeux tapestry is housed in the town centre at Bayeux. The town is served by trains between Paris and Cherbourg via Caen. Paris to Bayeux takes about two hours and service is shown in Thomas Cook's European timetable. (The best site for train times throughout Europe is the German railways site TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.bahn.de, which can plan a journey from your home station in the UK via Paris, but knowledge of basic German is necessary). One could travel to Bayeux from Britain by means of ferry to Cherbourg or Caen (Ouistreham) or by Eurostar to Paris. Note that the Eurostar arrives at Gare du Nord and trains to Bayeux depart from St Lazare. It is unlikely that it is possible to buy a through ticket to Bayeux from anywhere in Britain and it will probably be easiest to get this in France. It won't be expensive and you can pay by credit card at the station. Gregory Beecroft \u00b7 Take the ferry to Cherbourg then hitchhike down the N13, or take the ferry to Caen/Ouistreham then hitchhike up the N13.
