Clearly a vicious and sudden wind had blown my ball off course and into the densest undergrowth on the course. All was not lost, peering through the congregating (though excellently maintained) triffids I caught sight of something white. Daring to lean in with my club, I collected the ball, but alas it was not mine and the origin of it rather astonished me. Here was a lost golf ball with the logo UK Trade and Investment stamped on it. This was curious, why was there the name of a government funded organisation stamped all over a golf ball in Woking? It was an expensive Titleist golf ball, the type one might normally receive in a smart box for Christmas. This got me wondering how much money the government was spending on golf balls. I decided to table a written parliamentary question to the Secretary of State for the department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform: How much UK Trade and Investment had spent on branded golf balls in the past three years? The answer came on Tuesday November 11, and it was astonishing, \"In the last 3 years UKTI has spent \u00a312,030.50 on branded golf balls.\" This is a remarkable figure. Although these golf balls are expensive, it suggests that they have got rid of many thousands of golf balls, so they're either playing corporate golf far too often, or giving away far too many. I am speculating but if you were to give away a hundred golf balls at a corporate event \u2013 and that's a few each \u2013 then we are talking a quite serious amount of golf games in the past three years. And what else have they been giving out, footballs, rugby balls, tennis balls? I don't know, but it does seem possible that someone somewhere has been having a lovely time at the expense of the taxpayer. I appreciate that some companies advertise their service with branded golf balls but for the UK government to spend over \u00a312,000 on these luxury items during times of extreme economic crises strikes me as a waste of money. After all, look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves. I hope Lord Mandelson is suitably embarrassed and will firstly reduce the amount of corporate golf his department plays, and secondly will stop giving away golf balls at the taxpayers' expense. And this is the point, we've all got to be that much tighter, that much more careful in today's climate and we can start this by cutting the balls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
