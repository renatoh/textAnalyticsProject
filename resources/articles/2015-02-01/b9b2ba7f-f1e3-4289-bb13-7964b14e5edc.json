Forget his degree in political science or fluency in four languages, Mignolet has set himself apart by requesting this interview. A highly unusual move. He wants to discuss the flaws that prompted Brendan Rodgers to drop him and Bruce Grobbelaar to ridicule him. He wants to credit his fiancee with the recovery that has followed. Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper does not need a Ferrari to stand outfrom the crowd. This season has necessitated self-analysis by the Belgium international. In December he was dropped for \u201can indefinite period\u201d by the Liverpool manager after a run of form that spread anxiety through an already uncertain defence. Rodgers highlighted Mignolet\u2019s kicking as a particular concern, and Crystal Palace can testify to that. Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup fifth-round opponents scored after the 26-year-old conceded a throw-in from a routine free-kick in November. Ludogorets prospered from another error three days later. \u201cA hard road back\u201d was Tim Howard\u2019s assessment of his Merseyside rival\u2019s predicament, the Everton keeper adding: \u201cWhen you get taken out of the team, sometimes there\u2019s no way back.\u201d But Mignolet is back, producing vital saves from Seamus Coleman and Erik Lamela to maintain Liverpool\u2019s push for Champions League qualification in his last two outings and preserving as many clean sheets in his last five Premier League matches \u2013 four \u2013 as in 21 appearances from the start of the campaign. Boxing Day proved the turning point \u2013 but not when he reclaimed the jersey against Burnley from the injured Brad Jones. It arrived later that night when Mignolet\u2019s fiancee, Jasmien, broached the subject of a back pass he had allowed to run out of play when attempting to clear his lines at Turf Moor. The Liverpool keeper explains: \u201cI played half-decent, came for some crosses, but what happened in that game changed a lot of what\u2019s happened since. It was in the first half when I got closed down on a back pass. It was Boxing Day, my family were over here, and my missus and everyone were having dinner when she said: \u2018Simon, are you sometimes over-thinking stuff?\u2019 \u201cThose were her words. I didn\u2019t really give a response at the time. She knows when to speak to me about football and when to leave me alone. The next day I went into training and as we were analysing the game the coaching staff gave me the same words. \u201cThat was the trigger in my mind that we had to say \u2018Look, we have to sort this out\u2019. Jasmien comes to every single game and follows it. We\u2019ve been together since before I was a footballer and she knows me better than anyone, my character, that\u2019s why she said it. \u201cShe knows in my private life I am not the sort of person who will wake up and go and buy myself a Ferrari, which some people might do. I am maybe over the top in that sense. It comes from my education, how I have been brought up by my parents. I have always tended to over-think things and that had come into my game. That\u2019s good in certain moments but not when you have to make a quick decision. \u201cI was basically thinking too much over what was best to do and losing time rather than playing my natural game. I was always looking to find the best possible solution in situations, the right player to pass to, thinking \u2018you could do this, you could do that,\u2019 and was forgetting what was the worst solution, like giving away the corner at Burnley. So I made the decision that rather than thinking too much I would be more decisive and commanding and ever since then it has gone very well.\u201d Mignolet consulted John Achterberg, Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeping coach, the head of performance, Glen Driscoll, and the sports psychologist Dr Steve Peters over the tweaks needed to rediscover the form that prompted Rodgers to pay Sunderland \u00a39m for him in 2013. \u201cHe came into the picture to help me do certain things before a game,\u201d says the keeper of Peters\u2019 involvement. \u201cIt has helped me especially on high balls coming into the box, on crosses, making a split decision coming out of the box, clearing balls and back passes. There are some things that are going better than before.\u201d When it was bad, and the 3-1 league defeat at Selhurst Park marked the nadir for Rodgers\u2019 team this season, the goalkeepers\u2019 union did not show much solidarity. While Howard criticised Mignolet\u2019s demotion, Grobbelaar dipped into the book of crap 1980s football jokes to compare the Liverpool goalkeeper\u2019s problem with crosses to Dracula. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher faulted Mignolet for Phil Jagielka\u2019s stupendous equaliser in September\u2019s Merseyside derby at Anfield. Liverpool\u2019s No1 will always stop to answer questions after a game regardless of the criticism that might be coming his way but he refused to bite back. It is not in his nature. \u201cI did not want to speak up too early because I am not one who likes to speak,\u201d he explains. \u201cI wanted to wait for a few performances to talk about it and I think this moment is right to speak up. I am my own biggest critic. After every game I analyse my performance with the goalkeeping coach in a very critical manner. There is certain criticism you will take on board and other things that do not affect you. You cannot look too far into that because it can destruct you in a certain way.\u201d Grobbelaar\u2019s criticism was personal, vindictive even, but Mignolet harbours no resentment towards his Anfield predecessor. \u201cI would shake his hand if I met him,\u201d he insists. \u201cI appreciate him for what he has done for this club and I respect him for the major trophies he won for Liverpool.\u201d Whatever strides Mignolet has made recently, he knows he will be judged only on Saturday\u2019s performance at Palace and must constantly prove himself at Liverpool. Rodgers is sure to sign a new goalkeeper this summer. \u201cI relish being under that pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember playing in front of 500 people in the second division in Belgium and I prefer to play under the pressure of a Champions League game against Real Madrid at Anfield.\u201d As for Jasmien, will her Boxing Day advice result in a special gift this Valentine\u2019s Day? \u201cYou can put this as the headline,\u201d jokes Mignolet: \u201cShe gets a Valentine every day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
