Chiming with reports that real wages have tumbled by an unprecedented amount in recent years, it finds that incomes took another knock this month. Overall, three times as many households said their finances worsened in June against those who saw an improvement. But that was a less downbeat picture than in previous months and left the headline balance on the Markit Household Finance Index at 40.8 in June \u2013 the strongest reading since February 2010. It was the joint-highest since the survey began in 2009. \"Improving household finance trends are an early indication that the UK economy has continued to strengthen in June. Households' perceptions of financial stability are now at a level unsurpassed over the past 4\u00bd years,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. \"Better labour market conditions helped reinforce the upturn in households' financial expectations during June, as rising levels of workplace activity translated into diminishing job insecurities.\" But as workers accept lower pay and shorter hours to hang on to their jobs, more households reported a fall in income \u2013 the sharpest drop in wages since January. Markit said workers in the construction and retail sectors faced the biggest drops this month. The report follows research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies last week that said workers have suffered more financial pain since 2008 than in any five-year period of the modern age. Describing this downturn as the longest and deepest slump in a century, the IFS said workers have suffered pay cuts of 6% in real terms over the last five years. Workers report accepting pay cuts to keep their jobs, leaving them stretched by rising household bills and soaring food prices. The TUC claimed last week that the UK's annual pay packet had shrunk by \u00a352bn since the start of the financial crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
