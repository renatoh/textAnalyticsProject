But health workers on the frontline of the outbreak fear authorities are overestimating hospitals\u2019 capacity to care for critically ill patients. The country\u2019s health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, has praised Chile\u2019s health system as \u201cone of the best on the planet\u201d and insisted that enough beds have been available for critical patients. So far, Chile\u2019s Covid-19 mortality rate is 0.95% \u2013 well below the global average of 4.7% \u2013 but medics warn that this figure is giving authorities a false sense of security. \u201cIt\u2019s far too soon to say whether Chile is tackling this successfully,\u201d warned Dr Claudia Cort\u00e9s, an infectious disease specialist in the capital, Santiago. Despite increases in the numbers of Covid cases in Chile\u2019s capital, the majority of the city is not under quarantine. Several districts have been on lockdown for the past two weeks, but these measures will be lifted next week in six affected neighbourhoods. Early Covid-19 cases were concentrated in Santiago\u2019s rich neighbourhoods, imported by wealthy families returning from their summer holidays in Europe. Most of those cases were treated in private hospitals. But Cort\u00e9s works between private and public hospitals attending Covid-19 patients \u2013 and she fears death rates will rocket as the virus spreads to poorer areas. \u201cPeople in public hospitals get sick differently from ones in private hospitals \u2014 they are like two different worlds,\u201d she said. Dr Gabriel de la Fuente Tessler, who works with critically ill Covid-19 patients in a Santiago public hospital, also believes the statistics are misleading. He identified the lack of ventilators as a key problem: his hospital has only 18 machines, 14 of which are already in use. Each day, more patients are coming in, and no one is leaving. \u201cThe bus is filling up, and soon there won\u2019t be any seats,\u201d Fuente said. Temuco, 845km south of the capital, has seen Chile\u2019s highest coronavirus death rates. Located in Chile\u2019s poorest region, Araucania, the city is plagued by high pollution levels, contributing to respiratory sickness in locals. Temuco\u2019s central hospital has dedicated three floors to critical Covid-19 patients. Videos from the overrun hospital have circulated on social media, with staff resorting to wearing bin bags and adhesive tape as forms of protection. Family of deceased coronavirus patients told local media the hospital was turning away critical patients due to lack of resources. Dr Carolina Chahin, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, predicted the upcoming winter months would hit Chile\u2019s colder, southern regions hard. \u201cWe do not feel prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cThe public health system in Chile is impoverished,\u201d she said, adding that Temuco\u2019s hospital was the only one in the region with equipment to care for critical Covid-19 cases. Last week, all of its ventilators were at capacity. The health ministry immediately shipped six new machines to the hospital but Chahin said they did not have the staff to operate them. Doctors suspect the virus will quickly spread, exacerbated by the Easter holiday weekend. Although authorities are restricting travel, city-dwellers in Santiago have been attempting to get to their second homes on the coast. \u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for a big wave to break,\u201d said Dr \u00c1lvaro Piffaut, who runs the intensive care unit in Valpara\u00edso, a popular weekend and holiday destination. \u201cWe need a nationwide lockdown, now.\u201d Piffaut said his staff were worried and afraid. He believes Ma\u00f1alich is \u201cout of touch\u201d with the reality of public hospitals. \u201cWe are going to do everything we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are successful, it\u2019s credit to healthcare workers, not the government.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
