That's what Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen always tell us. However when it came to Southend and the return of David Webb to Roots Hall, I rashly cast their words aside amid the europhia. Southend were 'different' and therefore things would be OK. After two successive relegations and having to witness at first-hand Alvin Martin slowly spreading the evil West Ham empire to Roots Hall, Southend fans were surely allowed to get excited about the news that Webby was returning to the club he had taken to the top of the First Division at the beginning of the 1990s. Unfortunately, just over a year into the job, Webb resigned earlier this month. Perhaps Southend's pier was designed not to be the longest in the world but instead as a suicide tool for desperate Southend fans. In his parting speech Webb cited ill health and, amongst other reasons, being unable to meet expectations of fans. I think this was the crucial bit and is why the words of Hansen et al ring true. Webb's successful spell at the club came at a time when fans had only just discovered the First Division, let alone dreamt of being there; this time, however, many on the terraces believe we have a god-given right to be there and this has been our undoing. The increased expectation makes fans think a home draw with Torquay is the end of the world (well thinking about it....) and in the process puts too much pressure on the players. Ultimately they don't perform, the manager gets sacked and the process starts all over again. It's the reason why even money can't buy Wolves out of the First Division - they think just because of they've got a nice stadium they have an automatic right to play Manchester United every week. With that logic, I'm going to have an early bet on Southend to join the conference in time for the 2003/04 season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
