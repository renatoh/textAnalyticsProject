Manchester United's guest of honour turned up with a pirate's beard and a jacket that was more cat basket than catwalk. He still oozed French chic, of course, and his sense of timing was impeccable, as always. This was United's most vibrant attacking performance of the season, scoring five at home in the league for the first time in more than two years. They have certainly played better in that time and Crystal Palace's generosity in defence contributed much to the margin of victory. But in an attacking sense, the news of Ruud van Nistelrooy's injury plight should not engulf Old Trafford in too deep a sense of foreboding. The Dutchman's absence, possibly until early February, need not be a decisive blow in the championship race judging by the exhilarating form of some of Sir Alex Ferguson's most penetrative players. Cantona could have been excused for leaving Old Trafford confused by reports that Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane are past their sell-by date. Scholes has six goals in as many Premiership games, having taken 31 previously to score that many. Giggs evoked memories of those days when opposition defenders were described as suffering \"twisted blood\". Meanwhile Keane is flourishing in a slightly adapted role as a defence-minded, holding midfielder. One of the great readers of the game, he is back to looking what he is - a champion - rather than a clapped-out boxer after one fight too many. They will need to sustain these standards if United are to make light of Van Nistelrooy's absence. Tests have shown the striker's recurrent calf injury has led to his Achilles problems and Ferguson, estimating how long he would be without his leading striker, spoke of \"hopefully four weeks but maybe six\". Though the striker could miss the trips to Arsenal and Liverpool, Ferguson ought not to be too disheartened. He has the most expensive striker in England in Wayne Rooney, and Alan Smith, Van Nistelrooy's replacement, would probably edge out Rio Ferdinand for United's player-of-the-season award were it voted for at Christmas. This was not Rooney's most distinguished performance, beginning with Gabor Kiraly saving his ninth-minute penalty, but he still shimmered with menace. Smith's twisting header to make the score 2-1 demonstrated the rapid improvement in his finishing skills since his switch from Leeds. Kiraly's early heroics made way later on for routine errors in keeping with a Palace display that ranged from commendable stoicism to abject naivety. Scholes's two goals were skilfully manoeuvred but Iain Dowie, Palace's manager, is entitled to be aggrieved that on both occasions a visiting player allowed him to wriggle clear, first Ben Watson and then Aki Riihilahti. Danny Granville, capitalising on generous marking at a corner, rammed home an equaliser after Scholes's opener and Palace, with some audacity, drew level again after Smith's headed goal. Joonas Kolkka's header rounded off a piercing move at the start of the second half but United's response was brilliant and sustained. Within a minute Kiraly's feeble attempt to reach Gary Neville's cross contributed to Emmerson Boyce heading into his own net and, with the inquest still going on in the Palace defence, Scholes established a 4-2 lead with a clever finish two minutes later. Thereafter United indulged in target practice and, even with Cristiano Ronaldo on an extended Christmas break, Old Trafford was treated to more showboating than at any other time this season. Cantona had ghosted off into the night by the time John O'Shea, a first-half replacement for the injured Quinton Fortune, turned in Giggs's cross. The visiting contingent from Milan had also slunk away. The Rossoneri will not defend like Dowie's men but United's Champions League opponents left with plenty to ponder.
