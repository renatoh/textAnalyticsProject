Smoking will not be permitted on the grounds of any NSW correctional centre, including outdoor areas, car parks and visitor processing areas. Cigarettes, tobacco and smoking-related items such as matches, lighters and e-cigarettes will also be banned. Prison staff will be on standby in case there is any repeat of the rioting when Victoria introduced a similar ban. \u201cIf things do go wrong, we need to be prepared for that as well because we certainly don\u2019t want to have a repeat of what happened in Victoria,\u201d Corrective Services NSW commissioner Peter Severin told ABC Radio on Monday. Prisoners in Melbourne\u2019s Metropolitan remand centre in Ravenhall smashed doors, walls and fences, and ruined the fire alarm and heating systems after a smoking ban was introduced at the beginning of July. Damages were estimated at $12m. \u201cThis is the modern world \u2013 this is just one of many, many policies which prisoners may find unpalatable, but the fact of the matter is if you want freedom of choice, don\u2019t go to jail,\u201d NSW corrective services minister David Elliott told 2GB Radio. Severin said prison officers would not be lighting up in front of inmates. He said some staff lived on prison compounds, but well away from the actual prison, in homes they rented. \u201cThese staff will be able to smoke outdoors when they are off duty \u2013 well out of sight of any inmates,\u201d he said. Last month the former federal Liberal senator Chris Puplick, now chairman of NSW Justice Health, said he expected a \u201csmooth transition\u201d in NSW prisons. \u201cIn places like the Northern Territory and New Zealand when they introduced smoke-free prisons there was no significant problem,\u201d he said. NSW Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network, along with Corrective Services NSW, has been planning for the ban since 2013. Its 2009 Inmate Health Survey found more than three-quarters of participants were smokers, five times higher than the state average, and 85% of those smokers indicated they would like to quit. \u201cInmates have been provided with a range of outdoor and indoor activities as alternatives to smoking, including sports equipment, competitions and playing cards,\u201d Corrective Services said in a statement. Severin said prisoners would receive appropriate support as the policy was introduced. \u201cWe are fortunate in NSW because we do have immediate-action teams in our maximum security facilities. They are not there to throw their weight around; they are there to provide a very finely tuned blanket of security and support the staff. \u201cIt is sometimes a different job, particularly in situations where we introduced major, major policy change,\u201d he said. The transition to the ban has already led to an attempt at a black market trade; a stash of tobacco and other items were uncovered in a Sydney prison last week. The items were thought to have been purchased legally but their black market value after the ban could be more than $12,000, Corrective Services said in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
