Here, The Observer's resident seer provides a primer about zodiacal endeavours and their history, from Babylonian times up to the present. Spencer explains how the horoscopes which feature so heavily in print are the most basic part of a complex and evolving discipline which is upset whenever a new planet or large asteroid is discovered. If you don't take astrology seriously, you should, simply because lots of influential people do. Spencer looks at its use by financiers, and by celebs including the Reagans, Princess Diana and Hitler. Also incorporated is material about modern movements partial to readings, notably the Theosophists and the shadowy Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which numbered Yeats and Aleister Crowley among its members. Throughout, Spencer is intelligently sceptical: clear, like many practitioners, about his calling's fallibility. It's not hard to predict success for this paperback. The Bonesetter's Daughter Amy Tan Flamingo \u00a36.99, pp339 Another tale of trans-cultural family confusion that's set to be a bestseller. Ruth is a fortysomething West Coast Chinese-American with an enviable lifestyle. She has a stimulating job in publishing; her boyfriend Art is kind and empathetic to the point of new-man-ness; and her best friend Wendy constantly regales her with outrageous gossip. Then she finds out that her mother, LuLing, is developing Alzheimer's. The discovery disturbs memories of Ruth's troubled adolescence and motivates her to translate her family's secret history, set down in beautiful calligraphy by her mother. This is a compelling tale of austerity, civil war, cruelty and superstition back in the old country. If the privileged nature of Ruth's life has made her overly wholesome, the vicissitudes of LuLing's history are at the root of her skewed and cranky ways. Thus the book's twin narratives complement each other in appropriately - yes - yin-yang fashion. Wagner and Philosophy Bryan Magee Penguin \u00a38.99, pp 382 Wagner: composer of anti-Semitic bombast or musical genius immersed in the intellectual currents of his age? In this book Bryan Magee explains why he inclines to the latter view. The teutonic maestro's anarchist leanings led to participation in the 1849 Dresden uprising, but gave way to political disillusionment and an obsession with Schopenhauer and his notions of worldly suffering. Wagner was also familiar with many other philosophers' writings and Magee explores his use of the ideas of Kant, Hegel, Feuerbachand Marx, in the process setting out masterly summaries of these diverse philosophies. Late in Wagner's life, Nietzsche became his intimate, and Magee ably analyses the rise and fall of their friendship. In a lengthy appendix Magee deals with the vexed issue of Wagner's racism. He argues for our freedom to enjoy the music despite its creator's repugnant views, essentially because these are not reflected in the works themselves.
