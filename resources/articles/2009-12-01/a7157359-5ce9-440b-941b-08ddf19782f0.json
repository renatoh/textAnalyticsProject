A 21-man Donnybrook preceded Den\u00edlson's opener on the stroke of half-time and the second half proved something of a procession after Geovanni missed a penalty. Phil Brown lamented three points dropped as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger declared this to be the most open Premier League season since he joined Arsenal 13 years ago. He must have relished United's defeat at Fulham, but he had not forgotten about his spat with the Wolves manager, Mick McCarthy, which he dismissed as a difference of political ideologies. \"If a guy is a dictator and a guy has a different opinion he becomes an enemy,\" he said. \"I'm a democrat, when someone has a different opinion I try to understand why. Mick McCarthy is not an enemy and I respect his decision.\" Hull showed Arsenal a lot of respect in the first half and their obdurate defensive display frustrated a Gunners side that were visibly missing their captain, Cesc F\u00e1bregas. He also missed last season's fractious FA Cup tie, which is best remembered for the injured Spaniard, dressed in civvies, being wrongly accused of spitting at Brown's assistant, Brian Horton. The Spaniard once again made it on to the Emirates pitch in casual wear, this time to collect the club's player of the month award for November. These two clubs are developing a serious dislike for each other, which simmered in a largely uneventful opening half-hour. Craig Fagan shot wide for Hull before Abou Diaby and Eduardo both went close for Arsenal, the latter curling a left-foot shot from the corner of the area tantalisingly wide in the 23rd minute. The standard-issue clever touches of the Croatian and Samir Nasri were holding little truck with a side determined to keep a clean sheet and it was the tireless Stephen Hunt who tracked back to snuff out the danger when the pair combined in the penalty area. The enmity finally raised its ugly head just before half-time. A 21-man melee broke out in the Hull half when Nasri stamped on Richard Garcia after Arsenal had been awarded a free-kick. Only William Gallas resisted the call to arms and when it all calmed down Nasri and Hunt were cautioned by Steve Bennett. The additional time added after the shemozzle came in handy as Den\u00edlson guided a 25-yard free-kick over the wall and into Boaz Myhill's bottom right-hand corner in the 49th minute after George Boateng brought down Diaby. The goal merely served as a quick truce in a dispute that continued as the teams left the field at the break, with Nick Barmby and Nasri close to blows as they entered the tunnel. \"I think we need to leave those canopies open so you can all see what is going on,\" said Brown. Wenger, unsurprisingly, saw nothing. Eduardo stabbed wide unopposed from nine yards on the resumption of hostilities after the Croatian had, upon receiving a pass from Andrey Arshavin, left his marker floundering with the most delightful combination of back-heel and pirouette. In the 55th minute Bennett awarded Hull a penalty after harshly adjudging Mika\u00ebl Silvestre to have been holding Craig Fagan. Manuel Almunia saved Geovanni's spot-kick low to his right and an over-eager Hunt headed the rebound wide when the Brazilian may have had a better chance. The pain was sharpened when Arsenal doubled their lead four minutes later, Eduardo tapping home his fifth goal of the season from a yard after Diaby and Song unlocked the Hull defence with an excellent one-two. Diaby and Silvestre missed good opportunities before the former capped a fine performance with a fine goal. Again the Hull defence was undone by a one-two and when the France international received the ball back from Arshavin he rattled a shot past Myhill. Theo Walcott, twice, and Ramsey both went close late on as Arsenal enjoyed the calm after the storm. \"You could class it as three points dropped,\" said Brown, who admitted smaller clubs are getting some big results. \"I don't think it will be like that all season. I still think the top four will be the top four.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
