Mr Malone declared himself a \"supporter\" of the Murdoch family two months after becoming the second largest shareholder in News Corp's media empire, which spans Fox TV in the US as well as BSkyB and the Sun newspaper in the UK. The boss of Liberty Media hinted at a future collaboration between himself and News Corp boss Mr Murdoch, after years of alternating alliance and rivalry. \"Well, the first we gained was Rupert's attention,\" he told analysts after announcing plans to spin off Liberty's international assets, including its 20% stake in cable group Telewest. \"You know, we think Rupert can certainly count on us as a strong supporter of himself and his family,\" he said. In January, Mr Malone - a notoriously shrewd dealmaker who owns the QVC shopping channel and half of the Discovery network - increased his voting stake in News Corp to 9%. This marked a major change for the company, as Mr Murdoch had never before had a shareholder with almost one third as many votes as him. Mr Malone did not warn Mr Murdoch of his plans, and at least one source close to the family has suggested he did so simply to acquire voting stocks that could add a premium to the value of his shares should he wish to bundle up his assets for a sale later. Nonetheless, the deal raised questions at the time about Mr Malone's intentions - with some analysts speculating over a possible takeover bid and questioning whether the move could scupper Mr Murdoch's succession plans involving his sons, James and Lachlan. Today, however, Mr Malone suggested the move could herald a new and formidable alliance between the two moguls - with Liberty's cable-based pay-TV operations complementing News Corp's satellite pay-TV network, in which it has a 35.4% stake. \"In any kind of transaction involving News Corp, we think that voting equity will have a greater value, greater psychic value than the non-voting stock,\" Mr Malone said. \"Any acquisition by News Corp of any asset that Liberty has, or any acquisition by Liberty of any asset that News Corp has, could be contemplated using that [News Corp voting shares] as currency,\" Mr Malone said. \"There are assets that News Corp has that Liberty finds very attractive and wouldn't mind owning directly. And perhaps there are assets that Liberty has that News Corp would find quite attractive over time. There is nothing contemplated right now.\" His remarks, made to analysts in the US, come as Liberty Media, is to spin off its international arm to create a $9bn operation. The new company, LMI, will take over Liberty's 55% stake in UnitedGlobalCom, a European cable operator, 45% of Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese cable company and some cable interests in Puerto Rico. In terms of pure equity, Liberty Media now holds 17% of News Corp - exceeding the Murdoch family's 14% - and if it chose to swap more of its stock for voting shares, it could get to a point where it could outvote the Murdochs, who have 30.6% of the voting rights. Mr Malone's comments come three months after Mr Murdoch sealed the acquisition of DirecTV, the US's largest satellite TV company. The Colorado-based tycoon is notoriously secretive and at one point looked as if he was going to mount a rival bid for the US satellite TV company. Ultimately, however, he stepped aside from the bidding - paving the way for Mr Murdoch to land a \u00a34bn deal that realised his dream of creating a worldwide satellite TV empire. Mr Malone bought more than \u00a3300m of additional News Corp shares in March 2003, which helped Mr Murdoch finance the DirecTV transaction. He gained a substantial share in Mr Murdoch's company as part of News Corp's 2001 investment in US publishing and interactive TV company Gemstar, but it was all non-voting stock. The Murdoch family has remained unchallenged as by far the leading shareholder in News Corp, which has its origins in the Australian newspaper business founded by Mr Murdoch's father. Mr Murdoch has made it clear he intends to keep the firm in the family, with his sons lined up to inherit his crown. But if the family were seriously challenged or even outvoted, the path of succession might become less clear. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
