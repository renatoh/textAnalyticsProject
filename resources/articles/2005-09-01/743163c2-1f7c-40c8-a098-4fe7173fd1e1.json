The man responsible is Secondary School Teacher of the Year 2004, Philip Beadle, who has forged his reputation on engaging 'challenging' inner-city pupils. 'It was fun,' says Beadle. 'Yet strangely it had some kind of educational benefit. You'd get a boy who was able to read to a bunch of cows whereas he couldn't to a bunch of his contemporaries.' In another scene, Beadle can be seen, in a field again, smartly dressed in a suit and coat, teaching grammar like you've never seen it taught before: joining his charges in bouncing about, yelling out punctuation points, making corresponding swipes, jabs and slashes with their limbs, and grunting in unison ('Question mark, huh! Semi-colon, huh!'). The whole thing looks extraordinary, a cross between the Maori chant of the New Zealand All Blacks and a grammar-themed Lord of the Flies. At the same time it's strangely brilliant. Depending on where you're coming from, by the end of the first episode you've probably made up your mind; Beadle is either totally insane, or some kind of inspired prophet, selflessly leading us all out of the education wilderness. An emerging national hero even: what Jamie Oliver was to school dinners, Beadle could become to inner-city education. We talk in Beadle's garden at his home in Catford, south London, where he is performing 'domestic Daddy' duties, with his small sons, Lenny, Louis, and Sebastian. Intense, articulate, crackling with nervous energy, you can still see in Beadle, 40, the 'failed' rock musician, who gave up music for teaching English at the relatively late of 32 because he thought it was time for a 'proper' job. 'I'd always thought it was something I could go into,' he says, lolling back on the grass. 'But not until such time as I could give it my full attention.' Mischievous, sarcastic, Beadle is also as left-leaning as you might imagine. Certainly the teacher of the year does not hold back from passing comment on subjects ranging from single-sex schools ('unnatural'), private education ('fear of the poor'), and what he classes as 'government interference' in teaching. 'I've got a message for Ruth Kelly - sod off and leave us alone.' However, we're here to discuss The Unteachables, for which, together with other education experts, including Professor Ted Wragg and award-winning 'zero-tolerance' head teacher William Atkinson, Beadle had to try to turn around a group of 'challenging' 14-year-olds in two weeks. Handpicked for their catastrophic school records, altogether the pupils had notched up 56 exclusions by the time they arrived at the Suffolk study camp. And it shows. The introductory weekend swiftly turns into a kind of teenage Village of the Damned, with casual vandalism, smoking, gum-chewing and texting. The low point is when one rather sweet-faced boy flicks a lighter on and off and announces he's going to set fire to the barn. (Beadle tells me that, on the same weekend, they gang-attacked the director, forcing him to resign.) Elsewhere it's all 'fakking' this and 'fakking' that. It gets to the point where, alarmingly, you find yourself succumbing to the first sign of pompous middle age, muttering under your breath about the 'yoof of today'. If, like me, you happen to have a 13-year-old lying around, making the place look untidy, you might even start feeling slightly smug. As in: 'For all her faults, she hasn't threatened arson. Yet.' The worst thing - the saddest thing - is how indistinguishable they all are. The girls all come across like Catherine Tate's 'Bovvered' character; the boys, Asbos waiting to happen. When you first see them, they don't just look unteachable. They look uneverything-able. Indeed for many of them this is their last chance, which is where teachers such as Philip Beadle come in. When I meet him, he says firmly: 'There is no such thing as an unteachable child', and in the programme he sets out to prove it. However, eyebrows may be raised at some of his methods. One of the first things he does with his pupils is play a pointing game called 'Dickhead'. You can almost hear Middle England erupting in horror. Beadle patiently explains that this establishes him as a 'naughty teacher' giving him instant rapport with his students, but some people might wonder whether there's dumbing-down and dumbing-dow-wwn? Beadle smiles: 'You need to relate to kids,' he says. 'Get inside their heads and make a connection. So I speak the same language. Why not?' But he also says he speaks a much higher order of their language. 'So I never really dumb down.' Beadle's results speak for themselves. He has been hailed as 'uniquely gifted' by everyone from educational award boards to grateful parents and pupils and even John Humphrys (whose teaching 'skills' Beadle assessed for a Teachers TV documentary). At the once-struggling Eastlea School in Canning Town, east London, he produced their best-ever GCSE English results (in 2003, half his class achieved grades A* and A, while the other half got Bs). When he became Schoolteacher of the Year, colleagues and peers got in touch to say they were delighted a 'real' teacher had won. Crucially, Beadle seems genuinely passionate about the children he works with, who tend to come from severely disadvantaged backgrounds, insisting: 'These are just nice normal kids, who, for whatever reason haven't been able to engage.' Indeed, Beadle's teaching style could best be described as tough-empathy. On The Unteachables, he puts himself on the same level as his pupils, becoming almost teen-like himself, a bit like Dian Fossey with the apes. Elsewhere, he listens to them; gets them to lie down on the floor doing stretching exercises. He deals with children with 'bodily intelligence' (who find it impossible to sit still in class) by getting them to move about (hence the 'Exclamation mark, huh' stuff and the reading to cows). 'Why not?' he says. 'What's the point of putting people like that into straitjackets which they're instinctively programmed not to fit. Let's get them running around, moving. Good teaching isn't about being the old bore at the front of the class with a textbook.' In fact, says Beadle, his methods, far from being 'zany', are accepted educational theory. 'There are two prevailing theories in education at the moment. There is the notion of the seven different intelligences and there is the notion of the three different learning styles. Every teacher knows about this but it doesn't feed into their practice. I actively teach to the seven different intelligences in each lesson.' That said, Beadle doesn't think The Unteachables had a realistic time scale. 'A year might have been interesting. You cannot effect wholescale educational change in 14 days.' These days, Beadle divides his time between teaching at his new school, Crofton School in Lewisham, writing his column for Guardian Education and advising other teachers. While he was delighted to become Schoolteacher of the Year ('You only have to look at my failed rock career to realise I have a hole in my personality that craves recognition'), he isn't about to dictate that everyone start following his methods. 'I have this transient title, but for me to say that there's no other good teachers in this country would be ludicrous,' he says. 'There are brilliant teachers everywhere using radically different methods. The fundamental principles of a decent lesson are the same. There's really nothing revolutionary about being bloody interesting and having a good time.' Well, that's what Beadle might think. But with education fast replacing food as the new middle-class porn, The Unteachables might just divide the nation. There will be those who think the project is a waste of time. Others, like me, might consider that the former rock musician from Catford might be on to something: that he truly is inner-city education's answer to Jamie Oliver. Crucially, the 'unteachables' themselves respond very positively to Beadle. (We're not talking Dead Poets Society, but there's a begrudging consensus that he's 'all right'.) In the end, one supposes it all rather depends on what you make of the 'Exclamation mark, huh' stuff. For the record, Beadle thought he looked like a 'dickhead'. \u00b7 The Unteachables starts on Channel 4 on Tuesday at 9pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
