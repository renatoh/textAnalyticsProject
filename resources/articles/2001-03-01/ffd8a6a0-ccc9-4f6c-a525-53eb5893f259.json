Conservative peers said the international criminal court bill, which sets up a permanent tribunal to deal with war crime charges where national courts are \"unwilling or unable\" to prosecute them, would assume the power to decide issues such as the rules of engagement or the definition of a legitimate military objective. Lord Howell, the Tory foreign affairs spokesman, argued that the new court would have the last word in a case where the British authorities had decided there was no case to prosecute. He wanted to follow the French example and insert a seven year opt-out ex empting British servicemen from prosecution by the court. The Labour peer, Lord Shore, a former cabinet minister, warned: \"We are putting ourselves unnecessarily in the dock by accepting a number of these foolishly agreed clauses in this convention. I am not having our people dragged before some court simply because we have used depleted uranium.\" But the Foreign Office minister, Lady Scotland, said the ICC was \"full of safeguards\": in particular, national judicial systems would have \"first claim\" to deal with any case which concerned them. The ICC would be a complementary, not a superior court. She specifically ruled out reports that, for example, pilots who flew bombing missions over Belgrade could be taken to court because they caused indiscriminate civilian casualties. The Conservative amendment was defeated by 122 votes to 69. Afterwards, the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, in an intervention likely to be echoed in the election campaign, accused the government of denying British armed forces the protection that other states would give to theirs. \"How can soldiers be expected to carry out their duties on active service when they know that their own government will expose them to vexatious prosectuion from rogue states?\" The legislation is unlikely to reach the Commons before the end of the month, and may fall if there is a May election. So far only 29 states have ratified the treaty: it needs the support of at least 60 before it comes into force. France has inisted on the seven year opt- out sought by Conservatives. In the US, although President Clinton signed the treaty as he left office, the new administration's secretary of state, Colin Powell, has indicated it will not be put before the senate for formal ratification."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
