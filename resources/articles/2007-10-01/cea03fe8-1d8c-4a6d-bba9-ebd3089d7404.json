The announcement comes 24 hours after the oil company announced a 45% fall in third-quarter profits and follows an earlier warning from the new chief executive, Tony Hayward, that the BP needed to slim its organisational structure. The group declined to comment on a report that it had reached a deal with American regulators under which it would pay $303m (\u00a3149m) to settle charges that it illegally manipulated US propane prices. It also refused to comment on a report in yesterday's New York Times, citing government officials, that it is close to settling charges that it was criminally indifferent to worker safety, contributing to an explosion at its Texas City refinery in which 15 people died. BP said the job cuts at its North Sea operation were intended to simplify the organisation and increase efficiency. The changes were needed as output from the maturing fields in the UK North Sea declined. The company said that in 2004 it had employed 1,800 onshore staff and contractors at a time when production was running at 550,000 barrels a day. Output had now fallen to 350,000 barrels but the onshore workforce had increased to 2,100 people. Most of the job losses will be in Aberdeen, but operations at the Sullom Voe terminal in Shetland, the Kinneil terminal near Grangemouth, the CATS terminal in Teesside, the Dimlington terminal on Humberside and the Wytch Farm field in Dorset will also be affected. BP said the changes were essential to safeguard the future of its North Sea operations, on which it said it spends up to $4bn a year, at a time when not only was output falling but prices were rising. The main focus of BP's exploration, however, is in places such as the Gulf of Mexico and Angola. Andy Inglis, BP's chief executive for exploration and production, said: \"These plans are an important step in delivering BP's agenda of simplifying how the company is run and ensuring resources are focused on frontline delivery. Furthermore, they will help to secure our continuing presence in the North Sea.\" Trade union leaders were shocked by the news. Graham Tran, regional officer for Amicus, said: \"We did expect job losses but clearly nothing on this scale. \"This is a massive and devastating blow to the employees of BP and a surprise to the industry in general.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
