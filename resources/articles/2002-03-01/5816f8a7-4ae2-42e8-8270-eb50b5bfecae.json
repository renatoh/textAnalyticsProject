Having taken a barely deserved lead through the otherwise execrable Marc Libbra, the Canaries sat back while Coventry huffed, puffed and eventually blew their house down. Seconds from half-time Norwich went in front thanks to Libbra's fifth goal in 30 games since August. His understanding of the offside law appeared basic at best; the linesman given the onerous task of tracking his runs retired from the game in the 37th minute, presumably with repetitive strain injury. But his goal was the best of the match. Steen Nedergaard's cross was knocked into his path by Clint Easton for a neat finish. It was imperative in the circumstances that Norwich remained resolute at the start of the second half but they conceded from Coventry's very first attack. As the outstanding Youssef Chippo ran on to a Hughes knock-down and sped into the area Adam Drury had to choose between a tackle, a tug of the shirt, a shoulder barge or even \"a give up and hope for the best\". His choice left Nilsson as baffled as anyone. \"I think if you boot somebody in the head there's always a chance that you'll concede a penalty,\" said Nilsson. Despite the wind blowing the ball off its spot during his run-up, Hughes converted the resulting spot-kick neatly. The only surprise then was that it took until deep into injury-time for him to find a winner, his 14th goal of a season badly interrupted by injury and suspension. Their place in the play-off positions is becoming increasingly secure, though the Sky Blues must still face five other challengers. Hughes at least will refuse to be blown off Coventry's course. \"Everyone's aim is to play in the Premiership. That's where I'd like to be and I think everyone at Coventry would,\" he said. \"But I'm happy here and, even if we don't go up, I'd like to stay.\" Man of the match: Youssef Chippo (Coventry City)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
