ENGLAND: 306 and 132 for two. England won the match by eight wickets, and the Ashes. In sunshine which might have come to us from an August at Kennington Oval more than a quarter of a century ago, a victory for England over Australia was vociferously celebrated today. The result on paper suggests that after all the prize came to us fairly comfortably, but as a fact every run to the end needed hard work and determination to get. The Australians fought vehemently until a boundary hit or two would settle the issue. Then Hassett bowled like a gallant captain and opponent who chivalrously chose to be the first to present the laurel wreath. Had the gentlest wind of chance blown Australia's way the finish would have unsettled the nerves and, possibly, unseated judgment. W. A. Johnston, Australia's only spin bowler, missed taking important wickets by inches, for several mis-hits from him eluded a field which on the whole, appeared as omnipresent as avid and brilliantly safe. But though no patriotic spectator dared take events for granted, the die was cast against Australia. Ably and manfully though Johnston worked away, the wicket called for spin at the other end of the pitch as well. England needed too few runs with no need for hurry. No single bowler not a genius in his class could have won the match by dint of his arm in the circumstances, [even] Johnston, as splendid and sterling-hearted a cricketer as Australia ever sent to us. At a quarter to three Hassett missed Edrich's leg stump, much to his amusement. Compton made the winning hit, a pull from Morris, at five minutes to three, Davidson having flung himself bodies length and stopped a four the previous ball. Then the crowd ran over the field and congealed in a mass in front of the Pavilion, where the heroes were severally hailed, in vocally resonant, if not musical, numbers. Hassett, in a humorous speech to the crowd, paid his generous tribute to England. He has the philosophy to ask himself, now the battle is done, if he did not make a mistake in going into action at the Oval in so crucial an engagement with inadequate reserves of spin. One lesson of the rubber should already find the Australian at least receptive. So long as wickets are covered in Australia so long will England win matches against Australia in this country whenever rain and sun or wearing turf call for batsmen experienced against spin. It was England's turn, as they say, and every cricketer will be mightily pleased that all's well that end's well for Hutton's sake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
