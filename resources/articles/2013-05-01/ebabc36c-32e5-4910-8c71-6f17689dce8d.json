Barry Tootell, the boss of the Co-operative Bank, had been braced for a downgrade of the bank's credit rating after it had plunged to a \u00a3600m loss and pulled out of the bidding for 632 Lloyds Banking Group branches. But Tootell could not have expected the devastating scale of the revision to the all-important rating. Moody's told the Manchester-based bank that in 12 hours' time it would be announcing a six-notch drop, plunging the Co-op to \"junk\" status \u2013 a move that would have a severe impact on any attempts to raise money in the financial markets and raise serious questions about its long-term future in banking. While Tootell had already resigned following the collapse of the deal with Lloyds, his decision was known to only a handful of colleagues and was yet to be announced publicly. With a decision made to bring forward news of his departure, senior officials began to prepare public statements expressing \"disappointment\" about the downgrade but reassuring customers that the bank was functioning normally and could sell off businesses to plug any shortfall in its capital levels. When Moody's published the news just before 10pm on Thursday, it was largely overlooked by the City. It was not until Friday that the impact was felt. Co-op does not have exchange-listed shares because its ultimate parent is a mutual, but it has publicly traded bonds, the price of which plunged by at least 20% on Friday, illustrating the impact of the downgrade on the once-fast growing bank. Reading the analysis, it is clear that the problems stem from the breakneck speed of expansion and the ground-breaking deal in 2009 when Co-operative Financial Services merged with the Britannia building society. The deal was struck during one of the toughest periods of the financial crisis; bank shares were plunging and yet the Co-op and the Britannia appeared to have sailed through unscathed. The boss of the Britannia, Neville Richardson, became the boss of the enlarged financial services group, working under the Co-operative Group's ambitious chief executive Peter Marks, who had just engineered the \u00a31.6bn purchase of the Somerfield food chain before embarking upon the now-abandoned takeover of the Lloyds branches, known as Project Verde. What Moody's analysis clearly revealed was that the Britannia lending portfolio \u2013 overseen by Richardson, who suddenly left the Co-op in 2011 with a \u00a34.6m payoff \u2013 could cause more big losses. It also made clear that, four years after the deal, the two businesses have never been fully integrated. It also became obvious that part of the problem was that the Verde deal had put a stop to existing integration programmes and complex IT upgrades. When it was first struck last year, Marks had high hopes that the Co-op was heading into banking's premier league. The Verde deal would be the crowning achievement of a career with the organisation that had started at the age of 17 as a shelf-stacker. The merger with the Britannia had combined the Co-op's 109 branches with the building society's 245. The Lloyds deal would triple the size of the network to close to 1,000 and Marks was keen to champion his operation's credentials and the terms he had struck. \"Look at our record as a bank,\" he said in March last year. \"We have gone through the worst financial crisis in living memory, where most of the big banks that had bankers running them came a cropper, and we didn't.\" Even in August, when cracks were showing in the Co-op's half-year figures, he was boasting about outflanking Lloyds chief Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, saying he had \"got the shirt off his back\". At face value, that was correct: the purchase price had been negotiated down to \u00a3350m, compared with Lloyds's original hopes of receiving \u00a31bn-plus. Lloyds was even going to supply some of the debt to fund the transaction, and the government was trumpeting the Co-op as a much-needed \"challenger\" that would inject competition into retail banking. The deal appeared opportunistic, just as the earlier swoop on Somerfield \u2013 where the Co-op was the only bidder for an 880-strong estate \u2013 had been. When Marks had started work at the Co-op back in 1967, the group had a 25% share of the grocery market. While he could not turn back the clock, the Somerfield deal would cement fifth place in the food retail sector. Both the Somerfield takeover and Verde were part of a belief that the Co-op needed to be bigger in its two core businesses in order to compete harder. But when Marks presented the last set of results in March, the food division reported a 9.5% slump in profits and the bank was plunged to that painful \u00a3600m loss. At the bank, the all-important \"tier one\" core capital ratio had fallen from 9.6% to 8.8% \u2013 a level that, Moody's noted, was low relative to its peers. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"For whatever reason, regulators have allowed the Co-op to run with weaker capital ratios than listed rivals, notwithstanding it's a more narrowly defined business.\" It does not have the ability to generate profits at the speed of its competitors, hence the importance of the bank to be able to tap its parents \u2013 the financial services group and then the wider Co-operative organisation. Selling out of insurance \u2013 the life business is already gone and the general, motor and home insurance arm is on the block \u2013 is the key to plugging any capital shortfall. The hope is that this will avoid a raid on the funeral homes, the supermarket or the pharmacies \u2013 or even tapping taxpayers for a bailout. The Co-op is determined it will not come to that. A solution seems unlikely to be found before next Saturday's annual meeting, when Marks bows out after a 45-year career. He leaves his successor \u2013 another retailer, the former B&amp;Q and Superdrug boss Euan Sutherland \u2013 with a decision about whether to remain in banking. At a time when the reputation of bankers is being battered, the Co-op, with its ethical stance and attention to customer service, should be thriving. A government determined to foster competition, and the Co-op's loyal savers, will be hoping that Sutherland can find a way through the mess."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
