It came as jockey Kerrin McEvoy, who finished second aboard Tiger Moth, was hit with one of the biggest fines in Australian racing history for breaching whipping rules. Anthony Van Dyck, the five-year-old Irish stallion ridden by Hugh Bowman, suffered a fractured fetlock on the final bend and pulled up. The Aidan O\u2019Brien-owned horse was taken from the track by ambulance and later put down. \u201cIt is with sadness that we confirm that Anthony Van Dyck had to be humanely euthanised after sustaining a fractured fetlock during the running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington,\u201d Racing Victoria\u2019s Jamie Stier said. \u201cThe horse received immediate veterinary care, however he was unable to be saved due to the nature of the injury sustained. \u201cOur sympathies are extended to the owners of Anthony Van Dyck, trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien and all his staff who cared for the horse and are greatly saddened by their loss.\u201d The horse is the seventh to die after contesting the Melbourne Cup since 2013. Rostropovich suffered a fractured pelvis in the 2019 race and recovered. The death is the second this year at Flemington, which averages two fatal racing accidents a year in flat racing. Peta, the animal rights activists, claim 116 horses have died on Australian racecourses this year. The RSPCA said in a statement there were inherent animal welfare issues involved with horse racing and called for a review into industry practices. \u201cWhenever there is an adverse outcome for an animal, our expectation is that the industry will do a comprehensive review to identify ways to improve in an effort to avoid unnecessary injury or trauma in the future,\u201d said RSPCA Victoria\u2019s CEO, Dr Liz Walker. \u201cRacing presents numerous risks for horses and this very unfortunate incident illustrates the need for the industry to work toward better welfare for animals used in sport.\u201d Animal Justice Party MP Andy Meddick said \u201cMelbourne Cup is beginning to feel like Groundhog Day\u201d. \u201cNo animal deserves to die or be injured for gambling profits,\u201d Meddick said. \u201cRacing isn\u2019t the sport of kings \u2013 it is a pastime of animal abuse. No amount of industry spin, glitz and glamour or celebrities can hide the truth.\u201d Rallies against animal cruelty are held annually around Melbourne Cup day. This year they included protesters wearing horse-head masks gathered outside the Victoria Racing Club holding signs reading \u201cNup to the Cup\u201d and \u201cYou bet, they die\u201d. Concerns that Anthony Van Dyck, who weighed in at 58.5kg, could not win the race were dismissed the day before the race. The Caulfield Cup runner-up and last year\u2019s English Derby winner arrived in Melbourne with high hopes of giving O\u2019Brien his first Melbourne Cup victory. O\u2019Brien also lost a horse in 2018 when the Cliffsofmoher was put down after suffering a fractured shoulder. Horses are usually put down after sustaining injuries that would not normally pose a threat to a human life. There are a number of reasons for this, chiefly because they are unable to recover. Horses have lighter bone mass and, when a break occurs, the bone shatters, making it difficult to repair. Even if the bone does mend, there is a risk the bone will be deformed and will be unable to bear weight, and the horse is likely to suffer severe pain. A fatality report will now be prepared by the Racing Victoria Integrity Services team. \u201cThe fatality report gives consideration to the circumstances of the incident and any potential learnings to assist in the prevention of similar injuries in the future,\u201d Stier said. \u201cThe report will include the findings of a post-mortem which will now be conducted by the University of Melbourne Veterinary Clinic and we expect it will be several weeks before we have a completed report for consideration.\u201d Later in the day, McEvoy was fined $50,000 after race stewards found him to have whipped Tiger Moth 13 times before reaching the 100m mark of the race, and 21 overall, before finishing behind winner Twilight Payment. McEvoy was also handed a 13-meeting suspension for far exceeding the allowed amount of times a jockey is allowed to whip \u2013 no more than five times before reaching the 100m mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
