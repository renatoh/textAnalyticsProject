But as this Premier League season heads towards its climax Queens Park Rangers supporters can only hope the drama that is to unfold in front of them proves to be even more gripping and glorious in its conclusion than The Four Year Plan, Matt Hodgson's gasp-inducing documentary that aired on British television this month and charts how the club survived the chaotic ownership of, among others, Flavio Briatore, to rise to the Premier League. For QPR it is now about the 10-match mission, the opening scene of which plays out on Wednesday evening when they take on Liverpool at Loftus Road. The visitors pose a stern challenge but for Mark Hughes's side defeat is almost unthinkable given they sit 18th, a point from safety but facing a run-in from hell between now and the end of the season. After Wednesday night come trips to Sunderland, Manchester United, West Bromwich Albion, Chelsea and Manchester City alongside playing Arsenal, Swansea, Tottenham and Stoke at Loftus Road. Hughes is refusing, however, to be pessimistic. \"We've got to make sure we get a run of form and a little bit of luck. If we get that we'll be fine,\" he said. \"It won't be easy because of the position we face. But we're ready for the challenge and I feel sure we have the players to stay in this division.\" For all his confidence, the Welshman could not have envisaged becoming engrossed in such a fraught fight for survival when he replaced Neil Warnock as QPR's manager two months ago. The signs were there \u2013 the team were in 17th place having gone eight games without a win when Warnock, who had got them promoted the previous season as Championship champions, was dismissed \u2013 but Hughes knew he would be allowed to add to a squad hardly lacking in quality. Tony Fernandes, the Malaysian tycoon who became QPR chairman last August after buying out Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone's 66% stake in the club, duly gave him the funds to sign Nedum Onuoha, Bobby Zamora and Djibril Ciss\u00e9. Hardened in Premier League experience, they were expected to steer QPR into calmer waters. Instead the club has continued to sink, winning once in eight league games under Hughes and exiting the FA Cup at the hands of Chelsea. The 48-year-old can point to mitigating circumstances, most notably the long-term injuries suffered by key performers such as Alejandro Faurl\u00edn and Heidar Helguson, as well as the potentially season-defining bad luck endured in the recent 2-1 defeat by fellow strugglers Bolton when Clint Hill's clear goal was missed by the officials. But, overall, QPR's malaise reflects badly on a manager who walked out on Fulham last June because he felt they could not match his ambitions. Hughes continues to look at the bigger picture, however, insisting that through its plans to build a new training ground and stadium, as well as a commitment to invest in new players, QPR have the potential to become a domestic and European force if they avoid relegation and the huge financial losses and erosion in status that come with that. \"We're trying to build a new professionalism in terms of our thinking,\" he said. \"That was the attraction of coming here and I know that if we can get through this tough period we'll be a hell of a lot stronger next year. For now, though, we're in a scrap, there's no complacency in terms of what we have to do to stay in this league. We're focused and everyone has to step up.\" Hughes has been here before, having rescued Blackburn from relegation after taking over there in 2004. He has drawn on his experiences at Ewood Park to guide him through this battle and believes no club will have to reach the traditional 40-point mark to guarantee their safety this season. \"Fewer [points] will almost certainly be enough,\" Hughes said, before admitting he has worked out how many points he reckons all the main relegation contenders will get from their remaining fixtures. Asked if QPR, who currently have 22 points, escape relegation through his calculations, he replied: \"Absolutely, by a million miles.\" Liverpool await, then, and the chance for Ciss\u00e9 to score his third goal in four appearances for QPR against the team he signed for almost eight years ago. \"I've been impressed with his technical abilities, it's of a higher standard than I expected,\" said Hughes of the Frenchman who is flamboyant enough not to look out of place in Hollywood and is required now to help provide his latest club with another blockbuster ending."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
