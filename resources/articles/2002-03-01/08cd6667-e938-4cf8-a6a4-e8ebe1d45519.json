As the chairman Peter Ridsdale was apologising to Merseyside police for confronting Leeds's supporters after Sunday's scoreless draw at Everton, a delegation of Rio Ferdinand, Nigel Martyn and Alan Smith represented David O'Leary's first-team squad at a news conference to voice their support for the head coach. The players approached O'Leary for permission to show their support publicly after Kidd was targeted by the travelling fans at Goodison Park. \"I can understand they want to blame someone and if I was sitting in the stands I would probably want to find a scapegoat as well,\" said Ferdinand. \"But there's no point picking out an individual, especially not Brian. \"He's a tremendous coach and he's done a great job here. If he's driven away, it would have a big effect on the squad. All the players are behind him and if he went a lot of us would be thinking: 'Where do the club really want to go if this is happening?' It would leave the players wondering which direction the club is heading in. \"The fans are generally great but we have some who have their faults. The sooner they get behind us the better it will be for everyone.\" \"I asked Brian after the Everton game if he had heard the fans and he told me how upset he was,\" said Martyn. \"It's not fair to make him the scapegoat but that is what's happening. I just think it is up to the players to speak up on his behalf. We want him to stay and that's why we are here. Smith added: \"The fans are picking on him just because he is from Manchester and that's not right. He wants to win for Leeds United as badly as anyone else here. If he had to leave there would be a number of clubs queuing up to take him - that's how highly he's regarded in football.\" Kidd has assured O'Leary that he will not resign, but he would reassess his situation if there is another voluble show of dissent when Leeds host Ipswich at Elland Road tomorrow. Ridsdale was criticised by the police for leaving the directors' box at the end of Sunday's game to try to placate Leeds fans at pitchside. A police statement yesterday said it was accepted \"he had the best intentions\" but that \"his actions did cause concern\". No official action will be taken, although the police intend to write to the Football Association and both clubs. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
