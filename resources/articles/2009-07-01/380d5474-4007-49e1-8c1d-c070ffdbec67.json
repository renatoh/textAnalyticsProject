Directors' annual bonuses, when expressed as a proportion of basic salaries, have fallen by a quarter in the 12 months to April, down from 40% of basic to 30%. Over the same period, the FTSE 100 fell 38%. The survey does not take into account that in some cases board directors are successfully negotiating an increase in their basic salaries, mitigating the net impact on their take-home pay of falling performance bonuses. Revised deals are being secured despite unprecedented shareholder efforts to curb what they see as unacceptable revisions to boardroom pay deals. Last week saw significant shareholder protest votes against remuneration arrangements for board directors at three FTSE 100 companies. BT Group saw a 17% protest vote, including votes against and \"active abstentions\". Inter-deal broker Icap and credit data firm Experian saw similar protest votes of 12% and 19%. Some 40% of investors at Cable and Wireless either voted against directors' pay packages or abstained last Friday. Such votes are only advisory and appear to have been largely brushed aside by the low-profile non-executive remuneration committee members, whose job it is to set each company's directors' pay. Typically three-strong committees prefer to focus on survey data from private pay consultancies in order to ensure complex deals under consideration \u2013 including bonuses, options, restricted share awards and pension contributions \u2013 are benchmarked against those awarded at rival companies. Those managers immediately below board level saw the steepest decline in their bonus, according to the IDS survey. This group had enjoyed bonus awards for the year to April 2008 worth 20% of their basic salary; that has fallen to 13%. Meanwhile, middle and junior management saw their bonuses pared back from 10% of basic salary to 7.8% on average. Technical and professional staff experienced a lesser reduction in bonus, dropping from 8% to 5.5%. Elsewhere some board directors are enjoying substantially more than others. Tom Glocer, chief executive of IDS's parent company Thomson Reuters, enjoyed an annual bonus payout of $3.03m (\u00a31.85m), or 212% of his basic salary, for 2008. The payout for the American lawyer, who sold London-based Reuters to Canadian rival Thomson in April last year, comes on top of a $757,397 payment to cover the personal cost of relocating from London to New York and a \u00a327m takeover windfall. Thomson Reuters remains a FTSE 100 company through a dual listing. Steve Tatton of IDS said: \"Although bonuses have come under fire, with criticism linking incentive schemes to the use of high-risk, short-termist business strategies, employers continue to view performance-related pay as a valuable reward tool. \"As the economy has continued to decline, or at best stagnate, and with the majority of bonus payments linked to company performance, many employers may have to delay or further reduce bonus payments this year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
