So it\u2019s not surprising that along with Peru and Chile, which also run many thousands of miles north to south, it has one of the most varied climates. The area around the capital, Buenos Aires, has fairly equable weather conditions: mild in winter and warm to hot in summer, with plenty of sunshine, and rain falling fairly evenly throughout the year. Farther inland, the regions of the north-east and west are quite variable: to the north the climate is tropical, with hot, humid summers and cooler, sunnier winters. The area around the Andes \u2013 which includes South America\u2019s highest peak, Aconcagua, at 7,000 metres \u2013 is generally dry and sunny, with annual rainfall less than 250mm. The southern part of Argentina \u2013 known as Patagonia (a name shared with neighbouring Chile) \u2013 is mostly very dry, especially the further east you go. The north of the region enjoys warm summers but the south has generally very cool conditions, where Tierra del Fuego boasts many features of a sub-Antarctic climate, fauna and flora."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
