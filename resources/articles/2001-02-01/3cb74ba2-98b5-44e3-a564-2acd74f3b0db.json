Chelsea's defender Celestine Babayaro may also be in hot water as two incidents involving him but missed by the game's officials will also be considered. \"The referee Graham Barber has sent in his match report and has asked us to look at an incident which could be alleged to be a mass confrontation,\" said the FA's spokesman Adrian Bevington. \"He has confirmed that he did not see a couple of incidents involving Celestine Babayaro. The FA will take a look at these incidents and consider whether to send a tape of them to the video advisory panel for their views.\" Arsenal, who have had their fair share of disciplinary trouble, and Chelsea face fines of up to \u00a3250,000 if found guilty and individuals, not least Babayaro, may also be cited for misconduct once there has been an official review. Babayaro could be banned for three matches if found guilty of violent conduct in either incident. The Nigerian has been accused of deliberately treading on Fredrik Ljungberg's ankle and also appeared to flick out a boot, tripping up Dennis Bergkamp. The FA has also asked to look at the video of a mass brawl during Saturday's 1-1 draw between Crystal Palace and Norwich. Both clubs have already been found guilty of similar charges this season. Dave Bassett has withdrawn from the race for the QPR manager's job after talks with the club. The winner from a shortlist of Steve Bruce, Iain Dowie, Steve Coppell, Ian Holloway and Graham Rix should be announced tomorrow. Charlton's Shaun Newton, with more than 200 games for the club, has been transfer-listed at his own request due to a lack of first-team football. \"I understand his position and have reluctantly agreed to his request,\" said the manager Alan Curbishley. Blackburn Rovers have been in talks with Benfica's Ukraine midfielder Sergei Kandaurov. Brighton have rejected a club-record offer of \u00a31.5m from Wigan Athletic for their striker Bobby Zamora. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
