In a new paper, Donaldson, who led the fight against the flu pandemic in 2009 but stepped down when the coalition took power in May 2010, says the change of government response was the key difference between the two years and criticises the \"laissez-faire\" attitude of Andrew Lansley's Department of Health. Public health experts lined up to agree with the analysis. In a GP magazine article, the Faculty of Public Health president, Prof Lindsey Davies, said: \"It is a source of great concern that lives may have been lost because people were not reminded of the risks of flu and how to avoid getting it.\" Dr George Kassianos, immunisation lead at the Royal College of GPs, said: \"A striking difference between the two years was the fact that the usual national advertising campaign to promote the seasonal influenza vaccine was not run in the year after the epidemic. [That} reinforced the message of a 'mild flu' in that year. Influenza has never been 'mild'. It makes people ill, can cause severe complications and ultimately it can kill.\" Dr Paul Rutter of Imperial College London, one of the authors of the paper, said: \"We had [awareness campaigns] for 15 years as a core public health message. A lot of the public health community were baffled to see it dropped.\" The paper, published in the journal Eurosurveillance, says that, in the flu season during the winter of 2009-10, there were approximately 10% more hospital admissions, 30% more deaths and 30% more critical care admissions than in the two waves of summer and autumn 2009, the year in which the flu pandemic was declared. One-third fewer people \u2013 35% \u2013 consulted their GP with flu symptoms in 2010. \"The most notable difference between the two years was the government response,\" say Donaldson and colleagues. \"The public health response in the pandemic year was highly assertive. Strong public awareness and education campaigns were run. Extensive and rolling media coverage throughout the duration of the emergency is likely to have enhanced public understanding. Antiviral drugs were widely used for symptomatic individuals and, in the early phase, their contacts. Schools were closed, with antiviral treatment of cases and contacts. Unlike previous influenza pandemics, a vaccine was made available and used before the end of the pandemic year. \"In contrast, in the influenza season that followed the pandemic year, the approach was laissez-faire. The traditional influenza public awareness campaign was cancelled. There was no attempt to warn about the likelihood that the pandemic virus would be circulating (thus affecting younger age groups). There was no drive to vaccinate children, although it is unclear to what extent this was influenced by emerging concerns about pandemic vaccine safety in children and adolescents. The National Pandemic Flu Service was not activated and antivirals were not used extensively.\" Sources from the health department claimed that more people were vaccinated against flu in the second year than when Donaldson was in charge. Director of immunisation, Prof David Salisbury, said: \"We disagree with some of the conclusions, which are based on inappropriate comparisons. For example, the authors have compared periods of high levels of flu that happened in completely different circumstances. The first two waves were in the summer and autumn while the third was in a particularly cold winter so it was not surprising there were more hospital admissions and unfortunately more deaths in 2010-11. \"But we know flu is an unpredictable virus that can kill so we take it seriously every year. As soon as the seriousness of the 2010 flu season became apparent the chief medical officer advised GPs to consider prescribing antivirals to patients not in identified at-risk groups but who they felt were at serious risk of developing complications from influenza \u2013 and the national stockpile was made available to ensure access to supplies.\" Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said patients \"paid the highest price\" for the government's decision to abandon the flu awareness campaign. \"Expert warnings do not come any more high-level and serious than this review from a former chief medical officer,\" he said. \"Labour and public health experts repeatedly warned Andrew Lansley that axing the annual flu awareness campaign would have severe consequences.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
