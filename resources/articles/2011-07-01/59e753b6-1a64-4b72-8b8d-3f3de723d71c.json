More media eyes than normal are likely to be turning to the Daily Telegraph's racing pages on Monday. The paper's racing columnist is the former amateur rider and trainer Charlie Brooks, now better known as husband of News International supremo Rebekah Brooks. At least the Old Etonian has some sympathy from former colleagues. \"Mornings like these, Charlie Brooks must wish he was still training a string of jumpers,\" tweeted Derby-winning handler Roger Charlton on Friday. The closure of the News of the World has led to casualties among its staff, but the paper's racing writer Alastair Down was already on his way \u2013 executives at the paper having reportedly decided to end coverage of the sport before the decision was taken to pull the plug altogether. All change for Kauto Star If Kauto Star continues racing next season, the 11-year-old will have a new groom to look after him. Nick Child, who oversaw the dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner at Paul Nicholls' yard, has joined Stroud handler Tom George as assistant. The multi-talented Child, whose partner Kate Nutt has also moved yards to join George, has successfully trained Arab horses and point-to-pointers as well as commentated on the amateur sport. Codemaster on the move Young Qatari royal Sheikh Fahad al-Thani enjoyed big-race success at Newmarket on Thursday, with Frederick Engels in the July Stakes, but one of his other flagbearers is on his travels. Codemaster, who was saddled by Henry Candy to finish second in the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot, is believed to have been sold for a huge sum to race in Hong Kong. Strangers finally meet So notoriously reluctant is Sir Michael Stoute to talk to the press that the genial Teddy Grimthorpe, the racing manager for Prince Khalid Abdullah, took a novel approach following the victory of Eagles Peak in a maiden at Newmarket on Friday. \"Michael, let me introduce you,\" he said, turning to the media. \"I expect you won't know many of them.\" What's in a name? Rachel Hood, the Racehorse Owners Association president, has turned to the history books to name her three-year-old gelding Dick Doughtywylie, who finished a highly promising third on his debut at Newmarket on Friday. Trained by her husband, John Gosden, Dick Doughtywylie is a half-brother of Gertrude Bell, who won the Lancashire Oaks last weekend. The horse is named after Lt-Col Charles 'Dick' Doughty-Wylie VC, a married man with whom the writer Gertrude Bell exchanged love letters until his death at Gallipoli in 1915."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
