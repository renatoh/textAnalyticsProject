The West Indies head coach looked on as Holder removed his fellow all-rounder Ben Stokes for the second time in the match, the first of five English wickets to fall for 30 runs in 12.2 overs during the evening as the hosts closed on 284 for eight. Holder\u2019s side now need two quick wickets in the morning before England\u2019s lead swells much beyond its current 170 on the fifth-day pitch but Simmons, whose side stuck 318 on the board first time around, is confident their eventual target will be manageable. Asked about Holder\u2019s key strike, Simmons replied: \u201cIt\u2019s what he does. He comes back and puts in the big spells for the team. That\u2019s how he leads. I didn\u2019t expect anything different. He was bowling for a while and I thought he might make a change. But he wanted to get that breakthrough. That\u2019s the quality he brings. \u201cIt\u2019s been a special day for the bowlers. It was difficult in the morning, and also between lunch and tea, but in the evening they came up trumps because they persisted. \u201cAll you can do is get the two remaining wickets and bat normally. Whatever is put in front of us, we have a day to bat. The confidence from the way we batted in the first innings \u2013 the attitude \u2013 is going to be a huge plus.\u201d Zak Crawley, fresh from his second Test half-century with a career-best 76, said his battle with Joe Denly to play at Old Trafford was \u201cfor the powers that be to decide\u201d, and shared some regret at not stopping the collapse after his stand of 98 with Stokes was broken. Asked about the surface, the right-hander said: \u201cThe pitch is definitely drying out. It\u2019s a shame they don\u2019t have a few more left-handers because on that side of the pitch, where the bowlers have been running through, it\u2019s extremely dry. Hopefully it offers a bit for the spinners.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
