Products and talks from the schedules of Design Indaba and Stockholm, San Francisco and Vienna Design Weeks will appear alongside performances and exhibitions from the Serpentine Gallery, the London Festival of Architecture and New York architecture conference The World Around. All have been closed or cancelled due to Covid-19. The Virtual Design Festival (VDF) \u2013 which runs from 15 April to 30 June \u2013 was conceived by the team at interiors and architecture digital magazine Dezeen. \u201cThe architecture and design world has been affected by the pandemic, with key trade events and festivals cancelled and practitioners having to find new ways to sustain their business,\u201d says Marcus Fairs, editor-in-chief of Dezeen. \u201cIt felt natural to come up with an online platform to showcase projects and connect architects, designers, and creatives across the globe.\u201d Planned events include gigs by award-winning experimental singer-songwriter Beatie Wolfe and pianist and sound designer Rosey Chan, a programme of interviews organised by New York\u2019s The Metropolitan Museum of Arts architecture and design curator Beatrice Galilee for Earth Day (22 April) and a digital exhibition of work created by architect and artist Ron Arad, who calls the VDF \u201ca great initiative to bring us together at this extraordinary time\u201d. Arad\u2019s pieces are from his DFWTM series of artworks (a set of 20 fibreglass seat-like structures). \u201cThere\u2019s a piece I made on 31 January \u2013 the day we left the EU. I bought the newspapers of the day \u2013 all screaming Brexit \u2013 on the way to the studio. They were cut, torn and embedded in unset polyester. We thought we were \u2018freezing\u2019 the most life-changing day in the UK. Little did we know.\u201d \u2022 The Virtual Design Festival runs from 15 April to 30 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
