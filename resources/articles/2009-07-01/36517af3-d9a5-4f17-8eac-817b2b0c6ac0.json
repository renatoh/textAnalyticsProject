But more than that we salute our friends at Google ads for seizing an opportunity. \"Listen-in on cell calls. Read text messages \u2013 Cell phone spyundetectable! \u2013 Works with all phones,\" says one accompanying the story on Times Online. There's always someone cashing in. \ue136And there's admirable detachment from the News of the World online. \"Police probe Murdoch paper hacking claims\" it says. Further down the page, an ad. \"We'll buy your old mobile phone for cash.\" Just don't erase the messages. \ue136Les Hinton, erstwhile chairman of News International will probably be called back from the US to give fresh evidence to the culture select committee. What did he know, they will ask, and when did he know it. The committee, chaired by John Whittingdale MP, asked the same of Hinton in 2007 but, since then, it is said, the pair have met again, a dinner during a trip by MPs to New York. No record exists of their conversation, not least because only Clive Goodman, the convicted Murdoch evesdropper, and his friend Glenn Mulcaire ever did that sort of thing. So it is said. \ue136Trust Gordon to draw the line with trademark decisiveness. There will be no dodgy claims, no questionable donations, he said. And we know he meant it. But the message hasn't spread quite as far as it should, for what we also know is that on Wednesday, party officials summoned MPs to a meeting in the prime minister's room at the Commons to discuss the Political Parties and Elections Bill. In the House of Lords it was subject to an amendment put down by Labour peer Lord Campbell-Savours which would bar tax exiles from making donations to political parties. But when it comes back to the Commons, the MPs were told, you all better vote against it. We're skint. Who knows where we have to go to get a bit of cash. So that is probably what they will do when the bill returns on Monday. Not all of those so instructed were happy about it. Some were not happy at all. But wherever he was at the time, Lord Ashcroft \u2013 bankroller- in-chief of the Tories, whose tax status has never been quite clear \u2013 would have allowed himself a smile. \ue136Much soul-searching here after Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi (pictured) fires a broadside at the very heart of the Guardian. Our report detailing criticism of his arrangements for the G8 summit amounted to a \"colossal blunder by a small newspaper\", he says. The foreign minister, Franco Frattini, goes further: \"I hope that the Guardian is expelled from the great newspapers of the world. What the Guardian says is a joke \u2013 nonsense.\" Of course, our report wasn't anything of the kind but that's us consigned to Silvio's great big naughty step, alongside his usual foes at the Economist. And Bono, who accuses Italy of failing to honour its aid commitments. And the FT, which yesterday said that the Italians had planned to install secret audio links to relay top-level and private discussions to its entire delegation. It's all wrong; all of it, and we're in trouble. No privileges. No invites to his private parties. It's harsh but we have to learn. \ue136Finally, if only we could have been there to see Thomas Voeckler make his move 5km from the finish to win the fifth stage of the Tour De France in Perpignan on Wednesday. High excitement, gripping drama. Those who know say there is nothing like it. Still, all is not lost, for yesterday morning \u2013 interviewed on BBC London 94.9 \u2013 Lord Mandelson, who runs the government these days, spoke of his love for life on two wheels, and furthermore he challenged his fellow aficionado Boris Johnson to match him in a bike race. If it happens, it could be in August when the BBC stages a bike week special. And the hot money, we assume, would be on Mandelson. A cycler and not a quitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
