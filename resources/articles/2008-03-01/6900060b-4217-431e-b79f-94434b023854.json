McCain, who repeatedly claims to want to fight a clean campaign, suspended the aide, Soren Dayton. The video mixes clips of Obama with those of: his controverial pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who in a sermon called on those in the congregation to sing 'God Damn America' rather than 'God Bless America'; the black radical leader Malcolm X; and the Black Power salutes by US athletes at the Olympics in 1968. The video was put together by a conservative activist and picked up by Dayton, who today circulated a YouTube link. A McCain spokeswoman, Jill Hazelbaker, said he had been suspended and reprimanded. \"We have been very clear on the type of campaign we intend to run and this staffer acted in violation of our policy,\" she said. Dayton worked in McCain's political department. He had been an independent blogger who attracted McCain's attention with his attacks on his then Republican rival, Mitt Romney, and was invited to join the team. The Wright controversy has dogged Obama for the last week and forced him on the defensive. Hillary Clinton opened an opinion poll lead over Obama for the first time in weeks today. It was conducted while Wright's fiery sermons were shown on the internet and on television but before Obama gave his reply in a speech on Tuesday. In a nationwide Gallup poll of Democrats, Clinton established a significant lead - 49% to 42% - after trailing Obama since early last month. Other polls showed her increasing her previously slim leads in key states, including Pennsylvania that holds its primary next month. But those polls were conducted before Obama's speech on Tuesday in which he dealt at length with the controversy. His campaign team was today awaiting the first polls that will show whether the speech has helped undo some of the damage. A Franklin and Marshall poll in Pennsylvania, taken after Wright's comments were shown on the internet and television, put Clinton on 51% and Obama on 35%. Mark Penn, Clinton's strategy chief, said today: \"There are some pretty big changes happening out there with the voters. Barack Obama recently declared himself the frontrunner in the race \u2026 but a look at the polls show that Senator Obama's lead nationally with Democrats has been evaporating.\" Clinton was on the campaign trail today in Indiana, which holds its primary on May 6, and Obama was in West Virginia, which holds its on May 13. There are only 10 contests left. In spite of the setback for Obama, the arithmetic still favours him securing the Democratic nomination. He remains ahead in the tally of delegates who will decide the nomination with 1,617 to her 1,498 and it will be extremely difficult for her to catch up. Her hopes were not helped today by the passing of a deadline for Michigan to decide on re-running its primary. Legislators in Michigan broke up for a two-week break without finding a solution. Clinton has been banking on Michigan and Florida rerunning their primaries in expectation of wins in both. But the chances of reruns are fast fading. Her best hope is that the Wright row will continue to damage Obama and she wins strongly enough in Pennsylvania on April 22 to make Democrats rethink whether he is capable of taking the White House. The row could be given further life next week when Wright is due to speak at an annual meeting of a Fellowship Church in Tampa Bay, Florida. Members of the congregation in Tampa Bay, as do their counterparts in Chicago, say the snippets of his sermons on the internet and television misrepresent his overall, moderate beliefs. Even if Wright was to deliver a temperate speech, a media presence will keep the row alive. Obama's team tried to divert attention today by going on the offensive. He made a speech on the economy while his team claimed Clinton had been misleading the public about the North American Free Trade Agreeement (Nafta) with Mexico and Canada, which many Americans blame for job losses. Bill Clinton signed the agreement but Hillary has since tried to distance herself from it. David Axelrod, Obama's strategy chief, described her stance on Nafta as \"a question of political character\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
