As the Lionesses\u2019 manager finalised plans for Tuesday night\u2019s semi-final against the USA he acknowledged that a chastening defeat against Sweden in Rotherham last November \u201cruined Christmas\u201d for him. That 2-0 reverse left Neville ripping up and redrafting his blueprint for a January training camp in Qatar, with on-pitch workouts swapped for soul-baring evenings in Doha and the surrounding desert. The five-star hotels lining the Qatari capital\u2019s Gulf shoreline are well known for hosting high-stakes political negotiations but Neville opted to remove his players temporarily from England\u2019s luxury beachside base as politeness and pleasantries were briefly replaced by somewhat harsher home truths. \u201cWe had a real big moment when we got beaten by Sweden,\u201d Neville said. \u201cMy whole Christmas was ruined by that game. It wasn\u2019t losing, it was the manner of the defeat. So we took the players to Qatar and we literally transported them into the desert for a meal. \u201cWe put everything on the table. If we didn\u2019t like each other, if there were friendship groups, or whatever, we stripped it bare and laid it on the table. It was a throwback to one of those old-fashioned days when you just sit down, have an honest conversation and move on. \u201cThere were a lot of honest conversations in Qatar and we came out of that camp and won the SheBelieves tournament in America. From then on we\u2019ve been like a steam train.\u201d If the bonding process began under a vast star-spangled Arabian desert sky, it was properly cemented during a more conventional evening gathering in Doha. \u201cThe players took me for a night out for my birthday,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThat was the particular moment I turned to my assistant [Bev Priestman] and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got it now\u2019, because we really came together. \u201cSweden was the best thing that happened to us; it was the kick up the backside we needed.\u201d England returned from Doha with everyone apparently buying into a clearly defined plan. \u201cThe common goal, the common vision, is winning a World Cup,\u201d Neville said. \u201cOur common agreement is that we want to create a legacy; we know that, if we win the World Cup, then everything else falls into place. \u201cThat common goal means egos have now been put to one side. It\u2019s not about individual egos and Golden Boots. It\u2019s just about winning. I\u2019ve got 23 players who don\u2019t care who is on the pitch, they just care about victory. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality we\u2019ve brought in. Losing a semi-final would mean nothing to me; they only take pictures of the winning team.\u201d With temperatures set to be around 27C by Tuesday\u2019s 9pm local time kick-off, England must cope with the unforgiving heat making Lyon feel more like part of the Middle East than western Europe but Neville remains undeterred. England\u2019s manager believes sheer desire will transcend physical discomfort and remains confident that lifting the SheBelieves trophy in March proved a transformational moment, providing his players with a necessary craving for glory and its highly addictive properties. \u201cSheBelieves was my big moment, my big breakthrough,\u201d Neville said. \u201cYou had to get on that platform, hold that trophy and have the medal round your neck. After that\u2019s happened, you want it again and again. \u201cWhen I first won the league title with Manchester United I wore my medal for the next two or three days because I thought, \u2018I need more of this.\u2019 The best players want that feeling again and again. We have to stop being a semi-final team, make the next step and become serial winners like the USA.\u201d If Neville\u2019s admiration for Jill Ellis\u2019s side was diminished by the revelation that the USA had sent two \u201cundercover operatives\u201d, aka plain-clothed members of their administration team, to snoop around the Lionesses\u2019 team hotel, he laughed off a supposed sequel to \u201cSpygate\u201d. TV camera crews filming England\u2019s semi-final training session spotted FA security staff apprehending a figure seemingly lurking in the hillside bushes but the excitement evaporated when the \u201cintruder\u201d turned out to be an extremely puzzled and \u201cinnocent\u201d local taking his daily walk. It provided something to laugh about during the night-time tableau which unfolds when England\u2019s squad finish their evening meal. \u201cThe players don\u2019t leave each other\u2019s sides after dinner,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI\u2019ve played in successful sides and you smell it. In unsuccessful sides players go to their rooms when dinner finishes at 7.45pm. But my players sit around the eating room, playing music, laughing, joking. They\u2019ve got that look in their eyes; they\u2019ve got ice in their veins. I think to myself, \u2018We\u2019ve got something here\u2019, but tomorrow night we\u2019ve got to prove it.\u201d Should the Lionesses fail, it will not be for any lack of inspiration on their coach\u2019s part. \u201cI\u2019ve told the players you\u2019ve got to grasp it with both feet,\u201d Neville said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to grasp it with both hands, with all your body. This is the moment that I believe I got this job for; and I believe my philosophy, my values, will get us this victory.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
