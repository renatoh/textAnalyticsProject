Overall pitch Berry: Only the Greens will put the climate and biodiversity crises at the very top of the government\u2019s priorities, and other parties are only taking these issues seriously now because the Greens have won the argument. Corbyn: Unlike the Tories, Labour has a climate plan and it will create huge numbers of jobs in a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d encompassing offshore wind farms, housing upgrades, nationalised railways and energy, and a lot of new trees. Price: The Plaid Cymru leader made a strong pitch that Wales has been neglected by Westminster governments handing out infrastructure investment, which is vital to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon: Scotland is already a leader in onshore and offshore wind, and could go much further in renewable energy generation, as well as tree-planting and nature conservation. Swinson: The Liberal Democrats have traditionally been the strongest on green issues among the three main parties but have struggled to regain lost ground after taking part in the coalition, which failed to fulfil its promise to be \u201cthe greenest government ever\u201d. Swinson\u2019s commitments, for instance on achieving net zero only five years before the Tories, looked less impressive when compared with other parties. Best line Berry: The Greens have had the climate at the top of their agenda for years while the others are just catching up, Berry pointed out: \u201cDo you trust them to get this done without more Greens in parliament?\u201d Corbyn: \u201cThis election is the last chance to tackle our climate emergency.\u201d Corbyn did a good job of showing that he knows the issues, even if he didn\u2019t have answers for all of them. Price: \u201cAfter Scotland, Wales has the best resources [for renewable energy]. Wales was the cradle of the industrial revolution \u2013 and can be of the next one.\u201d The country famous for coal can generate renewable energy and green jobs. Sturgeon: \u201cCOP26 will be in Glasgow \u2013 Scotland will be leading the way.\u201d Next year, a international conference called COP26, where governments from every country will gather to determine the fate of the Paris climate agreement, will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. Sturgeon made it clear she will make the most of that international stage, and the Tories may regret their decision to award host status to the city. Swinson: Pointed out that small contributions by individuals are not enough \u2013 we need systemic change, and only politicians can achieve that. \u201cMaking it easier and cheaper to make the right thing, so it becomes the obvious decision to make.\u201d Strategy Berry: This debate was one for the Greens to shine, so in response to any commitment made by other parties \u2013 on how soon to reach net-zero carbon, on how much money to invest, on how to protect nature \u2013 Berry\u2019s trump card was that the Greens would go further and faster. Corbyn: Labour put the \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d at the top of its manifesto, and Corbyn has a personal image for green living, from his allotment to his self-professed \u201cmiserable-ness\u201d in refusing to turn on the heating. Corbyn would also seek international cooperation on the global problem of the climate. Price: Stressed Wales\u2019s potential contribution and future growth from renewable energy. Sturgeon: Scotland has a strong story on renewable energy. Just don\u2019t mention North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: Frequent flyer levy on anyone taking more than three international return flights a year. Worst moment Berry: Failed to explain why scrapping HS2 was a good idea, when calling for less flying. Corbyn: Defending nationalisation of the electricity grid, which Price suggested would divert investment from renewables, by claiming it would be easier to sell biogas back into the grid. Price: A rather feeble brag of claiming green credentials for changing his reusable nappies for his newborn son. Sturgeon: Refusing to directly address the question of North Sea oil and gas, preferring vague references to a \u201cjust transition\u201d to low-carbon jobs. Swinson: Floundering while trying to explain why the Lib Dems\u2019 target of net zero by 2045 was so much better than the Tories\u2019 2050 target. Unanswered questions Berry: Is it realistic to borrow \u00a31tn over the next decade? Corbyn: Does the party back Heathrow expansion, which half of Labour MPs voted for, and nuclear power? Price: Can Wales make the transition from a former coal-based economy to low-carbon industry? Sturgeon: North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: The Lib Dem record in the coalition. Verdict Berry: Berry showed a depth of familiarity with the issues that is her party\u2019s key selling point. Corbyn: Believable on these issues, and with a strong manifesto on the green industrial revolution. Price: Hammered home the point that Wales\u2019s potential has been overlooked and undermined by Westminster. Sturgeon: SNP are comfortable on renewables and the natural environment, less so on the North Sea. Swinson: Struggling to reclaim what used to be an easy win for the Lib Dems in being one of the greenest parties \u2013 now looking outflanked by Labour. Loser Boris Johnson, represented by a melting ice block. The Tories\u2019 decision not to engage on this vital issue shows they are just not interested in pitching to younger voters, who rate the environment as a leading concern. They have decided that the leave voters they are after won\u2019t be basing their votes on this, and their climate plans don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
