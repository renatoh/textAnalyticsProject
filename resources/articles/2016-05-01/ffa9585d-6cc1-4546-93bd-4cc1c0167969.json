Rising from the rough grass on this clifftop is a white Victorian lighthouse, the landmark that lends this golf course its most enduring characteristic. Built in 1873, it stands as a memorial to the remains of the 13th-century castle of Robert the Bruce, Scotland\u2019s greatest king. But for how much longer? On Wednesday, the course will reopen, reborn as the Trump Turnberry after its purchase in 2014 by American billionaire and presidential candidate Donald Trump. The five-star hotel and spa that sits opposite the course has had a \u00a3200m refit, but more than a few of golf\u2019s aristocracy will be hoping that Trump has chosen not to tinker too much with what is universally regarded as one of the world\u2019s most naturally beautiful sporting arenas. The Irish golfer P\u00e1draig Harrington, a double winner of the British Open championship, describes the ninth as \u201can iconic hole, a special place\u201d. For the great US golfer Tom Watson, the course has become a sacred place. Here, in the hot summer of 1977, Watson participated in one of the most enduring rounds of major championship golf ever seen when he duelled with Jack Nicklaus for the Open crown. Watson famously won at the last hole as the lighthouse and Bruce\u2019s stones bore witness. Ever since the purchase, Trump\u2019s most trusted senior lieutenants have insisted that their boss, the loudest man in the world, would do nothing to alter the character of this place. Yet there are others who fear the newly installed Republican champion for the White House will be unable to resist making Turnberry\u2019s white house a permanent memorial to his greatness. \u201cIf Trump wins the presidency,\u201d a seasoned observer said this weekend, \u201cpassing ships may have to get used to seeing a statue of Trump guiding them along the coast, instead of the lighthouse.\u201d Graham Spiers, one of Scotland\u2019s top sportswriters and a resident of this part of Ayrshire, says he would be surprised, however, if Trump made any attempt at turning this place into a Donald shrine. \u201cI\u2019ve reported on two Opens held at Turnberry and have been privileged to play here myself, and reports of its beauty and ethereal atmosphere are not overstated. Trump, despite all his grandstanding and playing to the gallery, is no fool. When he decided to build his course in Aberdeenshire, he hired Martin Hawtree, one of the most respected golf-course architects in the world, to confer some magnificence on it, which he duly did.\u201d Though the course opens later this week, the grand ceremony will not be until 24 June, when there is a suggestion \u2013 made by Trump himself \u2013 that the billionaire may fly in to cut the ribbon. The purchase and redevelopment of Turnberry has been low-key compared with the slew of bitterness and controversy that characterised the construction of the Trump International in Aberdeenshire. Like its south Ayrshire cousin, this course was also built on a beautiful stretch of Scotland\u2019s coastline, but it also involved the bulldozing of several environmentally important sand dunes and alleged intimidation by Trump of local homeowners who stubbornly refused to sell. Trump promised thousands of jobs and an accompanying property development on the grand scale. Neither of these has yet materialised. He says he halted his development when the Scottish government refused to move some offshore wind turbines he considered to be a blot on the sightline of his pride and joy. This was the least of it, though. Trump\u2019s promise, during his campaign for the Republican nomination, to have a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States\u201d led to threats by the Scottish government to refuse to allow him into the country. Plans to host the Scottish Open golf championship at the Trump International course were scrapped, a move that bore the imprint of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government, a part sponsor of the tournament. Turnberry has been the venue for the Open championship on four occasions, and will not host it again until 2022 at the earliest. By then Trump could be leader of the free world, but if he hasn\u2019t modified those comments about Muslims \u2013 and others about Mexican immigrants \u2013 Holyrood will do all it can to ensure he misses out on that one, too. This leaves Jeane Freeman, the newly elected SNP MSP for this part of Ayrshire, in something of a dilemma. It\u2019s not often you get the chance to welcome the world\u2019s most famous billionaire with his retinue and his dollars to your manor, but is the political baggage worth it? \u201cI doubt if there are any views I share with Donald Trump,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my first responsibility is to my constituents, and when someone comes here promising to invest \u00a3100m in the area and create almost 200 jobs, I will facilitate that as much as I can. \u201cThere\u2019s a caveat, though. These jobs need to be sustainable, properly paid and come with reasonable contracts of employment. If so, if I were to be invited, I\u2019d have no hesitation in meeting him to talk about investment in the local economy.\u201d A few miles further down the coast sits the town of Girvan, considered the most attractive of Ayrshire\u2019s seaside resorts in its 1960s and 1970s heyday, attracting thousands of families from Glasgow. Those days, though, are now a distant memory and, despite the prospect of the next US president occasionally jetting in and out, local people don\u2019t expect that to change. Faye Wilkie, the owner of Girvan\u2019s Queen\u2019s hotel, the oldest tavern in the town, said: \u201cI\u2019m not expecting Mr Trump\u2019s presence up the road to make a significant difference. The Turnberry hotel has always been a high-end establishment and we see very little of it. But good luck to him. I don\u2019t have any problem with him being here at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
