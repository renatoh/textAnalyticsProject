Not only do 13 million Britons admit having taken an illegal drug at some time in their life - as our Drugs Uncovered magazine reveals today - but our assessment of the health risks has become more mature. Our poll respondents were more likely to judge tobacco high-risk than ecstasy. They also think alcohol more dangerous than cannabis. These are remarkable findings. They reflect a collective judgment of risk that in turn reflects the nation's collective experience. The possession of largely non-addictive drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy may still be punishable by a prison sentence of up to five years, allegedly reflecting the risk they pose to society and the individual. However, the population at large no longer believes those risks to be severe. Five million Britons admit smoking cannabis. Medical research now confirms what they believe; cannabis is safe unless used extravagantly and addictively. Even then it is less harmful than cigarettes or alcohol. At the other end of the scale, medical evidence and experience alike are united in the view that heroin and crack cocaine have powerful addictive qualities and are physically and mentally destructive. You stay away from them; and most drug users do. In between cannabis and heroin lies a range of soft, broadly non-addictive, drugs where once again people's judgment of risk is more level-headed than the law - although here social mores run well ahead of the medical evidence. Up to a million young people regularly use ecstasy - and deaths are astonishingly rare. The same is true of cocaine. The risk for the future is that we may discover that such drugs accelerate physical complaints, notably heart conditions, and cause mental problems in later life. So far the jury is out. What we do know, however, tends to support the view that these drugs, as long as they are pure, are largely non-addictive and relatively harmless if used sensibly. The old belief that there is a predictable and linear relationship between using so-called soft drugs and progressing inevitably to hard drugs has proved unfounded. Crime cartels In every Western country drug use has grown exponentially over the past 30 years. Western populations simply do not accept the legitimacy of the war on all drugs - just as the American public did not accept the legitimacy of prohibition in the 1920s and '30s. As demand steadily grows, this indiscriminate war serves only to entrench international crime cartels and create a vast offshore network of money laundering now used effectively by international terrorists and tax avoiders. Meanwhile, drugs available on the street are of varying quality and sometimes dangerous for the user. The wide varieties of toxicity of drugs that our own reporter was able to buy highlights the way this underground business abuses its consumers - sometimes with deadly results. And because drug use is overwhelmingly the preserve of the young - more than half of Britons between 16 and 24 report drug use in our poll - it is children that are most at risk. Equally serious, millions of young Britons now grow to adulthood holding the law in contempt. Good law reflects our social preferences; the current law does not. That so many continue to use drugs while risking such high penalties is testimony to the needs they satisfy; it is also evidence of how inadequate a deterrent the current law is. Britain needs a comprehensive overhaul of its drug laws. In a free society, responsible adults should be permitted to exercise their liberty but this still needs to be balanced with the risks to them and the society around them. Over drug use this poses uniquely difficult trade-offs and judgments - not least because so many who make choices about drugs are the young approaching adulthood. For them, society's obligation to educate about risks, to prohibit life-threatening temptation and to offer assistance out of addiction is even more acute. Young people at risk The Government is moving; officials and Ministers with experience of cannabis in their youth are already considering its decriminalisation while taking a more intelligent approach to heroin addiction, as we also reveal today. We believe they should go further. The moment has come for legalisation of the distribution and consumption of cannabis. We would not extend this legalisation across the gamut of non-addictive drugs yet because we are not confident that the medical risks are fully understood - and because young people with their lives ahead of them are most at risk as the heaviest users . We propose instead that possession of drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine be decriminalised. That is a halfway house, with supply still unlawful. But it is an appropriate one, which might be revised in 10 or 20 years' time. We do not believe ecstasy and cocaine use to be so menacing that it merits punitive prison sentences and a criminal record. However, we should retain the current legal penalties against drugs whose addictive powers and impact remain a threat to life. The war against heroin should remain a war. With proper focus and public support, it has a chance of being won because it is seen as legitimate. This is far from a blanket endorsement of drug use. Cannabis should only be distributed under licence; it should not be advertised; it should be taxed; its intensity should be strictly monitored and displayed. The framework would be a tougher variant of the regime for alcohol and tobacco use. For the range of drugs only decriminalised the penalties against trafficking would remain - but decriminalisation would permit much closer regulation of content to ensure it was not harmful. This should still be accompanied by a significant education programme about potential risks. The focus on prohibition should be on heroin and crack cocaine. However, we should also adopt a more enlightened - and much more adequately financed - approach to managing the problem. Recovery from heroin addiction should be nationally managed and supervised in a network of recuperation centres. We believe that these recommendations reflect the centre of gravity of national opinion. Moreover, they would bring the law into line with the way we actually behave and they offer a much more exact calculus of the true risks of drugs. This prospectus would free police time, raise revenue, make drugs less unsafely impure, and continue to ban those that are truly dangerous. Above all, it would make Britain a more mature country in which to live. Now we need politicians brave enough to act."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
