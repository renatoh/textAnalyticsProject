The 34-year-old striker, who was Albion's top scorer last season, rejected the offer of a 12-month contract at The Hawthorns and decided to return to the Championship because Birmingham offered a two-year deal. \"I'd love to have another crack at the Premier League,\" said Phillips. \"Yes, I had the opportunity to do that at West Brom and people may criticise me for that. But another factor is that if I'd stayed at West Brom I felt I'd probably spend all the time on the bench and not on the field.\" Birmingham, meanwhile, have failed in an attempt to prise another striker, Dave Kitson, from Reading. It is understood that Birmingham inquired about the 28-year-old, who scored 10 Premier League goals last season, but were told there was no chance he would be sold to another Championship club. Fulham have also been linked with Kitson, who was reported to be close to an England call-up last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
