Tweet of the week \u2018Could be worse\u2026\u2019 Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls has his say over whether \u201cHancock Out\u201d is an appropriate headline for the end of Matt Hancock\u2019s leadership bid. Endorsement of the week Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly both backed Boris Johnson. The pair had been so impressed with his skills during their time working with him as London mayor that they both initially ran against him for the leadership. It\u2019s still unclear what had made them nervous about a man who commissioned buses without windows and a cable car that has fewer users than Johnson\u2019s estuary airport, which was never actually built. Before any crucial EU talks, it was surely his negotiating skills that convinced them. Who could deny his credentials, having bought three water cannon from Germany, refurbished them, and sold them for scrap at a \u00a3300,000 loss? That should put Angela Merkel on notice. Theme of the week No deal. The Tory leadership race has often resembled a battle to replace the captain of the Titanic halfway through its maiden voyage. Yet this spectacle now has another unlikely twist, with contenders openly cheering on the iceberg. Yes, a willingness to embrace a no-deal Brexit has become an essential part of any candidate\u2019s armoury \u2013 in this case, in the form of a gun pointing straight at the country\u2019s temples. Dom Raab and Johnson have their revolvers primed. Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Michael Gove just want it lying casually on the desk at EU talks. That just leaves Rory Stewart, the only contender sane enough to rule out no deal. But in this catch-22 contest, if you\u2019re sane, you\u2019ll never be leader. Gaffe of the week Asked about her past misdemeanours, Leadsom admitted: \u201cI may have occasionally cycled on a pavement as a child.\u201d Her pathetic rap sheet made her bid for Downing St look laughable. Taking class A drugs is the bare minimum for any serious contender. Frontrunners really need to have discussed beating up a journalist and, ideally, imperilled a British citizen held captive abroad. Come back when you\u2019ve robbed a bank or two, Andrea. Campaign of the week Mark Harper No one could have failed to be captivated by Mark Harper\u2019s bid for No 10, but just in case, let\u2019s recap. Spontaneity wasn\u2019t a strong suit. At his launch, Harper insisted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be that scripted.\u201d Unfortunately, that was one of several lines pre-released to the media. His Twitter game seemed strong, asking social media users to \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d. Several people used the opportunity to ask an urgent query: \u201cWho are you?\u201d Then there was his launch event, which featured the slogan: \u201cPromising, Delivering, Brexit.\u201d Except, there was a pink line through \u201cpromising\u201d. Was it highlighted? Was it crossed out? Was he having the decency to renege on his Brexit pledge immediately, saving us the bother of the inevitable implosion? It still isn\u2019t clear. At the end of all this, Harper\u2019s bid ended in inexplicable failure. Good week Purveyors of canned goods Stock up the larder. Ready the tins of fruit cocktail. The leadership race is making no-deal Brexit more likely. Lorraine Kelly Having made her dislike of former colleague Esther McVey clear, the daytime TV queen spoke for the nation, saying she was \u201csick to the back teeth of the whole toxic political atmosphere\u201d. Next week, Anthea Turner on the housing crisis. Bad week Transparency Several hustings have been held in private, meaning the success or otherwise of the candidates has been mediated to the press via their supporters (\u201cJeremy was amazing, better than Churchill. People were weeping! You had to be there\u2026\u201d). Never one to let sunshine in on magic, Johnson continues to lie low, having been Sellotaped to a chair in Lynton Crosby\u2019s basement. The candidate markets UP: Michael Gove, Rory Stewart After his cocaine admission, his team have managed to draw a line under the issue. Stewart\u2019s walking tour of Britain saw the outsider secure enough support to carry on rambling. DOWN (and out): Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper, Esther McVey So long. See you for the next contest later this year? Just so you don\u2019t forget him, that\u2019s Matt Hancock pictured left."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
