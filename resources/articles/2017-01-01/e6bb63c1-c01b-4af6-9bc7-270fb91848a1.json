The idea of full employment as a desirable political goal is so taken for granted that we barely think about it. But what if work \u2013 in the form of paid employment \u2013 isn\u2019t the unalloyed good we routinely presume it to be? What if, in fact, more work is the problem? This is the challenging idea at the heart of a report released by the Green Institute, a progressive thinktank headed by Tim Hollo. The institute was founded in 2008 to provide policy advice to the Australian Greens but Hollo says his goal since being appointed executive director in early 2016 has been to make the organisation more outward-facing. The report, Can Less Work Be More Fair?, comes at a time when concerns about jobs being displaced by robots and other forms of technology are heightened. \u201cIf we fail to analyse these trends and look to the future right now, we\u2019re missing a huge issue,\u201d Hollo says. He argues that we need to reexamine attitudes to work and see it as less central to defining who we are. \u201cOur culture has increasingly told us that paid work is where we find our dignity and our place in society and if we aren\u2019t able to find paid work, we are less worthy.\u201d But, he says: \u201cThere is so much more to life, to contributing to society, than paid work.\u201d In the report itself, that view is expressed this way: \u201cWhat if, instead of trying to recreate an old world of abundant paid work, we \u2026 built systems, institutions and cultures in which less paid work could lead to greater equity, reinvigorated democracy and civil society, better environmental outcomes, and a more caring, creative, connected community?\u201d If that is the philosophical underpinning of the report, then its practical aspects rest on a discussion of two key policy positions: shorter working hours and a universal basic income. The policies are presented as the pillars of a new approach to economic management, one that would see Australia move towards what report contributor Prof Greg Marston, a sociologist at the University of Queensland, calls a \u201csteady-state economy\u201d. \u201cThis is an old idea in economics, which simply means an economy of steady or mildly fluctuating size,\u201d Marston explains. \u201cSo if the pie isn\u2019t going to get any bigger,\u201d Marston argues, \u201cwe need to focus on a fairer distribution of wealth, which is a critical component of sustainability and the steady state economy.\u201d This is where a UBI comes in. This suddenly popular policy \u2013 the idea of paying everyone a basic wage, whether they are working or not \u2013 is being tested in jurisdictions around the world as governments realise that the traditional labour market, predicated on everyone having a full-time job, is increasingly failing to provide the security it once did. Marston and other contributors to the report see UBI and shorter working hours as the way to address these problems, problems likely to be exacerbated as technology threatens more and more jobs. \u201cI think the two policies reinforce each other,\u201d Marston says. \u201cThey send a message that a healthy society is one where we don\u2019t have a simultaneous problem of overemployment and underemployment, as we currently do in Australia.\u201d He makes the important point that a UBI is a floor on earnings, not a ceiling, and that therefore, \u201cthere is nothing about UBI that is incompatible with paid work\u201d. Despite the report basically championing UBI, Hollo himself worries that the concept is being oversold by its proponents. \u201cUBI is often posited as a silver bullet, and I am deeply sceptical of that view. It will need to be one small part of a broad suite of policies, addressing universal health and education, affordable housing, job sharing and much more. \u201cSo it\u2019s my belief that working less should be a central aim of a prosperous and fair society. But what policy settings we use to get there, I am not sure.\u201d This open-mindedness about the best way forward is a welcome attribute in a political landscape now dominated by ideologues and authoritarians. It means the report he has overseen is more about opening up a discussion of our future than closing it down with ready-made answers. Hollo thinks the argument the report is making can win people over, even those in politics and business who might be inclined at first to dismiss it. Mark Carnegie, a venture capitalist based in Sydney, is indicative of business leaders at the cutting edge of the economic change discussed in the report. He is just as concerned that business and government simply aren\u2019t prepared for the change that is coming. \u201cThe software robots are coming to eat all the jobs, of that there is no doubt,\u201d he says. But most of us are \u201cfloating down the big river in Egypt called Denial\u201d. He worries that a \u201ccouple of generations could easily be flushed down the loo as society adjusts,\u201d and although, historically Australia has been at the forefront of developing innovative social policy, he believes that isn\u2019t the case at the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re doing nothing about thinking about the bigger issues. We\u2019re just trying to trim our existing system,\u201d he says, adding that will not be good enough. Carnegie thinks a UBI is the one of the few substantial new policy ideas that has any hope of coping with the changes being wrought by technology. He relates it to previous periods of technological change where it took \u201chundreds of years\u201d for a countervailing powerto restore equity back into the system. Ultimately Hollo believes there\u2019s a potential win-win available if everyone can see past their entrenched positions. \u201cPeople actually work far better when they are treated better, when they work less hard, when they feel respected and valued,\u201d he says. \u201cMany companies are coming to understand that, and I believe those ideas will spread, more than anything, because they are so obviously true.\u201d With his history of taking part in public debates about climate change, Hollo knows that what is \u201cobviously true\u201d doesn\u2019t always prevail. At least the report offers a stepping-off point for the serious and very necessary discussion."}, "isHosted": false}}}
