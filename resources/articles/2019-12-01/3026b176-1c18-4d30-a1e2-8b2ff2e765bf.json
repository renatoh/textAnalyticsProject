Kaja Sokola had previously been known as \u201cJane Doe\u201d in an earlier class action lawsuit. She is now removing herself from that suit and going public, motivated in part by news that Weinstein and his former film studio\u2019s board have reached a wide-ranging settlement that includes a total of $25m for more than two dozen actresses and former employees who claim Weinstein sexually harassed them. \u201cI cannot accept the proposed \u2018global settlement\u2019 as fair or just. There is no accountability for the perpetrators, insufficient compensation for all of the victims, and millions of dollars going to people that I believe enabled Weinstein,\u201d Sokola said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cTherefore, today I am filing my own case, in my own name, under New York\u2019s Child Victims Act,\u201d she added. Scores of women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He faces a 6 January criminal trial in New York on rape and sexual assault charges in state court, where he has pleaded not guilty. Weinstein has vociferously denied any non-consensual sex allegations by his accusers. In the new lawsuit Sokola recounts an incident in 2002 where she alleges Weinstein had promised to take her to lunch in New York to discuss her career but instead took her to his apartment. When there she alleges Weinstein \u201caggressively and threateningly demanded sex\u201d and \u201cinstructed her to take off her clothes\u201d, and forced her to touch his penis while he \u201cgrabbed at her breasts\u201d despite her protestations. Sokola said her experience caused her to leave acting. \u201cI have long since moved on from modeling and, because of Harvey Weinstein, gave up on my dreams of acting,\u201d she said. \u201cI have learned that some wounds never fully heal. Memories of sexual abuse are like a scar after a burn, but because the injury is to the psyche, it is invisible to everyone except the victim. By revealing my own scar, I hope to encourage others to speak up about their own experiences.\u201d Her lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said: \u201cWhile others may have decided to settle, albeit under some of the most offensive and one-sided terms, we hope that the filing of this complaint encourages other victims and the New York attorney general to join us as we continue our efforts at holding Harvey Weinstein and his enablers accountable.\u201d Weinstein, 67, recently had spinal surgery and has used a walker when seen in public in recent court appearances. He also appears to have embarked on a campaign to win public sympathy by giving a rare newspaper interview in which he told the New York Post his \u201cpioneering\u201d work on \u201cmovies directed by women and about women\u201d was being forgotten. That prompted 23 women to sign an open letter saying Weinstein was \u201ctrying to gaslight society\u201d. The letter added: \u201cHe will be remembered as a sexual predator and an unrepentant abuser who took everything and deserves nothing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
