Lasting about 40 minutes, it consists of three movements, each shorter than its predecessor, so that the first movement is as long as the other two put together. Most of the musical variety comes from that opening movement too; it's a carefully constructed patchwork made up from no less than eight distinct themes, which Glass develops and superimposes in an impressively contrapuntal way that's a reminder he studied in Paris in the early 1960s with Nadia Boulanger. After that a passacaglia provides the cool centre, while the finale is far more concentrated and concise. Glass may not be breaking significant new ground with his Eighth Symphony, but its music does have a consistency and coherence lacking in some of his other recent orchestral pieces and the performance under Dennis Russell Davies is as expert as usual."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
