For the adults in attendance, it was probably the other way around. \"Every year, Mum and Dad would have a big party at the stable [in Southport] on the Friday,\" he says. \"Everyone would be there, and jockeys too, which probably wouldn't happen these days. It was a very special night and we'd all build up to it for a few days before. The whole weekend was a big part of the family, and if there was a National when we didn't have a runner, it didn't feel the same.\" The Grand National has been bound up with the lives of the McCains almost from the day that Donald Jr was born in May 1970. Red Rum arrived at the Southport yard of his father, Ginger, around the same time, and by the time young Donald was seven, the greatest horse in the race's history had completed his unprecedented three victories. Anything that Ginger sent to the National from that day forward always attracted huge attention, no matter how slim its chance, though no one really expected him to win the race again. But then he did, with Amberleigh House six years ago, and now Donald Jr, who took over his father's licence in 2006, has a chance to saddle yet another McCain-trained winner when he sends out Cloudy Lane this afternoon. It would, he stresses, be a family triumph. There is no generation gap here, no friction or competition between father and son. Donald's four years in charge have seen him train winners on National Hunt's grandest stage, the Cheltenham Festival, a significant improvement on his father's record there. Yet he acknowledges that he has been blessed with much better horses than Ginger. \"Dad never really had a chance until Red Rum came along, and he made a great job of him,\" he says, \"but after that things were a bit thin, and the only time we got the opportunity to get what might be a good horse was when it was one that might be an Aintree horse. There were one or two owners that used to ask him to go and look for one, and that's what he did. Everything was geared around going to Aintree. \"We just muck in as a family and everyone's involved. Mum, Dad, my wife, my sister, lots of staff who've been there a number of years. There's no me and you, we just get on with it as a family and a team and it works.\" The Cheltenham Gold Cup is the pinnacle of the sport, the race that goes to the best chaser in training, but McCain does not hesitate when asked if he would rather train the winner of the Gold Cup or the National. \"I'd rather have a National winner,\" he says. \"I feel like I've been involved in one, as I used to ride Amberleigh House every day, so it's not the be-all-and-end-all for me if I don't. But the Grand National is very special to our family, so though I feel like I've had one already, I wouldn't complain about one or two more either.\" Cloudy Lane was joint favourite for the National two years ago and finished sixth without ever threatening to win. Last year, he unseated Jason Maguire at The Chair, and perhaps as a result, can be backed this time at 50-1. Like any McCain horse running in the National, though, he has been prepared with the race as the sole objective. \"I wouldn't swap him for the favourite,\" Donald says. \"He's run a couple of good trials and this has been the aim all year. He unseated last year, but he was travelling very sweetly at the time. You need a bit of luck, obviously, but we've got a good racing weight and we're going to be very competitive. \"In the old days back in Southport, we were so local that people would always come up to stay for the meeting, and the whole town felt like it was involved. Now we're a bit more out of the way [nestled between Nantwich and Wrexham in Cholmondeley, Cheshire], and I think our horse has slipped under the radar a bit, but he's a good horse with a very solid chance.\" He may have runners with better chances in the years to come. He is not quite 40, after all but for McCain the National has seemed almost like an extra family member for as long as he can remember, and he knows better than anyone that it offers no guarantees. \"It's the one race of the year where we just want to be involved,\" he says. \"There's a bit less pressure on us now, as we've got quite a few nice horses, whereas once the National was the only chance we had all year to have a good winner. \"As a family, we've never been into fancy cars or holiday homes. All we've ever wanted is to be around nice horses, and that's what we've got now. As long as it stays that way, the job's not so bad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
