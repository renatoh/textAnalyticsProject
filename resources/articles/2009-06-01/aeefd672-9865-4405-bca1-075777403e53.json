A survey of public-sector pensions published today puts the cost at more than \u00a31tn, or 85% of GDP. The report by the British-North American Committee, a group of business, unions and academics, examines government commitments to public-sector pensions in the UK, US and Canada. It accuses all three governments of underestimating the costs of providing pensions by using exaggerated projections of investment returns over the next 40 years. It said the UK government, which has the largest proportion of unfunded schemes of the three countries, has the biggest problem. The public-sector pension cost in the US and Canada is a little more than a quarter of GDP. The report chimes with warnings from the rich nations' thinktank, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, that governments risked social unrest unless they tackled the widening gap between workers in cheaper private schemes and those with generous guaranteed pensions, especially in the public sector. The OECD voiced concerns that preoccupied governments might neglect pension reform as they navigate a route through the financial crisis. Tory and Liberal MPs have already called for a review of public-sector pensions. Business leaders joined the chorus earlier this year following a clutch of reports highlighting the escalating costs of providing gold-plated pensions to Britain's 5.8 million public-sector workers. According to the latest figures, the bill to taxpayers will rise to \u00a33.8bn a year this year, almost \u00a31bn more than a year earlier. While some arrangements, including the local government pension scheme, are invested in assets that will fund at least a portion of workers' pensions, most schemes are unfunded and paid directly from the Treasury. The annual cost is expected to rise dramatically over the next decade as the bulk of the baby boomer generation retires. A rise in the number of workers in the public sector who enjoy guaranteed pensions will also add to the burden. The last published figures showed that between 2006 and 2007, the number of private sector workers getting a \"defined benefit'\" pension plunged 300,000 to 2.7 million. The number in the public sector continues to boom, up 100,000 to 5.2 million. Unions have defended the pensions, arguing that public-sector workers are mainly low paid compared to the private sector. The average pension income provided by the local government funds is about \u00a34,000. They also point out that most attacks on workers' pensions come from organisations with a wider agenda to curtail costs in the public sector. Neil Record, who chaired the BNAC's working group that drafted the study, said: \"Governments, when challenged on the huge forward liabilities involved with public-sector pensions, are all too keen to respond that these can be 'comfortably met from future income from taxpayers'. \"The reality, however, is that the true costs of these large financial commitments are being hidden from present taxpayers and, even more worrying, are destined to predetermine the use of monies raised from future taxpayers as yet unborn. \"Inevitably, this will reduce the amounts available for the running of public services in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
