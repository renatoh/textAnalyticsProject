He was like  a zombie'", "bodyText": "The following apology was printed in the Observer\u2019s For the record column, Sunday October 28 2007 In the article below we wrote about Paul Clarke, who committed suicide in 1998. He was living and working at the Life Foundation Centre in Snowdonia, Wales, at the time. The Life Foundation disputes the contents of this article. It is concerned that readers may have been given the impression that Mr Clarke\u2019s medical needs were neglected when, in fact, it says that those needs were met. It has asked us to point out that members of the Life Foundation referred Mr Clarke to a qualified psychiatrist (as mentioned in the article). He was also observed by a GP with a special interest in the mental health of young people. He was seeing his own GP at the suggestion of the Life Foundation. We are happy to make this clear and apologise for any distress this may have caused. ******************** Paul Clarke is glueing together a small, porcelain statue of St Francis of Assisi, smashed into a hundred pieces. It is painstaking work and Paul, 35, is absorbed in the delicate operation. It is likely Paul, who has gentle, green eyes and a thinning mop of fair hair, smashed the figurine in a moment of frustration, something that has become a common occurrence. This is almost the last thing Paul will do with his life. In the next few hours he will write letters, including one to his parents, one to the foundation and one to his nine-year-old son. Then he will take the cord down from a Velux blind and, some time on the evening of the 14 October 1998, hang himself. In the ensuing hours, Paul\u2019s body will be found, the police will be called and his parents informed. Paul\u2019s valedictory letters, in parts rambling and inchoate, will be dissected by those who loved him as they try to piece together the fragments of his life: a futile attempt to understand his disturbed mental state. Eight years on, one phrase, in the letter to his son, will continue to echo in the void: \u2018Find a man who can teach you.\u2019 Paul, like scores of other dreamers, idealists and drop-outs, found such a man. Bethesda, a small, isolated town on the edge of the Snowdonia national park in northwest Wales is the sort of place you drive through rather than to. To the west, beyond the town on the A5, lies Bangor and beyond that Anglesey and the ferry to Ireland. Nestling in a sepulchral valley, Bethesda\u2019s rows of grey, stone-clad houses hugging the hillside have seen better days. Several of the shops lie empty, a visual testimony to the area\u2019s struggling economy. Many passing through might not pay Bethesda a second thought if it wasn\u2019t for the burning flame standing 8ft tall outside a motel on the outskirts of the town. Surrounded by a pool of water and enveloped in a glass box etched with declarations of peace in a multitude of languages, the flame seems incongruous, its ultra-modern casing clashing with the forbidding backdrop of Snowdonia. A sign tells the curious that if they want further information about the flame they should ask at the motel which adjoins the main retreat of an obscure organisation called the Life Foundation. Here, they will learn about the benefits of Dru Yoga, the foundation\u2019s physical activities programme. There is little mention of the foundation itself, for these days the pacifist organisation, based around Hindu teaching, tends not to trade on its name. Some of the locals have taken against it. Graffiti warning \u2018sex cult ahead\u2019 is daubed on the road outside. Colin Douglas, 59, a small man with an appealing face and a shock of white hair, spent 10 years with the Life Foundation, one of thousands who has passed through its doors since it emerged in the mid-Seventies. A musician, Colin lost his ability to perform in the winter of 1988 when he suffered a nervous breakdown. Suicidal and on antidepressants, Colin stumbled across the Life Foundation during a conference at one of its centres in the West Midlands. Instantly he was mesmerised by the foundation\u2019s charismatic leader, Mansukh \u2018Manny\u2019 Patel, who was trying to raise funds to build an alternative cancer care centre. \u2018I was hooked, I shook my wife Anne awake and said \u201cThis is it, this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for all my life,\u201d\u2019 says Colin. Within days he had signed up to a meditation weekend at the foundation\u2019s retreat in Wales. \u2018At the retreat someone came up to me and said, \u201cDo you want to talk to Manny?\u201d and I said, \u201cYes please.\u201d He said, \u201cTell me all about it,\u201d and so I did. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t do much about your trumpet playing, but I can do a bit about the other.\u201d He looked me in the eyes and I saw the whole of creation flash before my eyes. He said, \u201cGo away and be happy,\u201d and that was it. I was in a magnificent space. I went home to Anne and my kids and said, \u201cI\u2019m cured.\u201d I threw my pills away.\u2019 Colin\u2019s story is typical of those drawn to the Life Foundation. Many are teachers or nurses; clever, caring people who want to make a difference by supporting its campaigns for world peace. They are often emotional people, some suffering depression or recovering from breakdowns, searching for something to complete themselves. They are intrigued by the claims made for Dru Yoga and the weekend retreats in Snowdonia with their promises of inner peace. After a few courses many look to spend more time at the foundation\u2019s retreats. A number opt to stay and work for the Life Foundation. In Patel, a tall, handsome 51-year-old, they see a way forward. With his numerous self-help books and belief in providing \u2018a safe and nurturing environment for each and every individual to express their natural joy and creativity\u2019, he holds out the hope of earthly salvation. Once inside the foundation, followers enter a world of ceremonies devoted to the Hindu god, Krishna. \u2018You just get pulled in,\u2019 says Anne. \u2018The spiritual part is really strong. It\u2019s really attactive if you\u2019re searching for something.\u2019 The diet is vegetarian and ex-members claim Patel advocates followers should choose celibacy while living in the foundation\u2019s headquarters. For this reason Patel recommends husbands and wives should not live together when they join the foundation. Instead they are taught to focus on Patel, their guru. \u2018Patel urges his followers to fall headlong in love with him so they could receive the unobstructed flow of his transcendental love and blessings,\u2019 recalls Bridget Ancel, a former follower. The foundation maintains Patel has never claimed to be celibate, merely that he says periods of sexual abstinence are part of the yogic tradition. For many years the foundation has enjoyed a favourable image, with Patel often referred to as the \u2018young Gandhi\u2019 in the local press. The Life Foundation has presented miniature peace flames to Pope John Paul II and Tony Blair. It has made well-publicised attempts to raise money for war victims. In his publicity brochures, Patel preaches emancipation. \u2018Each one of us is born to be free. So walk towards freedom; keep heading in that direction; and may that smile that knows all things finally appear across your heart, across your face and in your beautiful eyes...\u2019 The cynical may wonder how people could be drawn to such platitudes. But Colin and Anne, like many others, were hooked. They sold their house in the West Midlands and moved to Bethesda so they could devote their lives to the foundation. Colin did odd jobs at the centre and composed much of the background music for Patel\u2019s audio tapes, self-help guides which promise inner peace. Anne helped clean the headquarters and prepared meals. The day they graduated to wearing white robes - a sign that they had risen within the foundation\u2019s hierarchy - was a proud one. The last time Margaret, 69, and Richard Clarke, 70, saw their son alive was the spring of 1998, six months before he died. They took their son and grandson to Anglesey. On a bitterly cold day, father and son skimmed stones across a lake, trying to find a connection as Margaret and Richard watched from afar, hoping the reunion might drag Paul out of his torpor. But something was very wrong. Paul was displaying signs of acute agrophobia. He had ripped his eyebrows out in frustration. \u2018He was little more than a shell, like a zombie,\u2019 Margaret says. Paul had suffered panic attacks before joining the foundation but his parents had never seen him as bad as this. Four years previously, Paul had briefly left the foundation and returned home for a few months\u2019 respite. He would march up and down ranting, clutching his head and screaming, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with me? I don\u2019t want to feel like this,\u2019 Margaret says. Part of Paul didn\u2019t want to return to the foundation in Bethesda; part of him felt compelled to go back. It was an ambivalence he had felt from the outset. In his diaries, Paul talks about his doubts about the foundation. In one entry, he writes: \u2018Strange feelings have begun to arise about the Life Foundation. I am not sure about it at all inside.\u2019 But like many, Paul had seen enough to find something to hold on to. A bright, gregarious teenager who went to a good school, gained a degree and travelled the world, Paul grew up to become a disaffected twentysomething, profoundly troubled by the times he was living in. \u2018He was always concerned for others,\u2019 Margaret says. \u2018That\u2019s what attracted him to the Life Foundation; they appeared to care for others.\u2019 Soon Paul was dividing his time between his girlfriend and son and the foundation. Paul tried to persuade Lucy to join him, but she was wary of Patel. \u2018The first time I was invited to speak with him he kissed me full on the lips. I thought, \u201cYou\u2019re no guru,\u201d\u2019 Lucy says. The tensions triggered by the competing attentions of his family and the foundation were palpable. Within months, Paul\u2019s parents say he went from being a leader to a submissive follower. \u2018He would make arrangements to see someone outside the foundation and then obstacles would be put in his way,\u2019 Margaret recalls. \u2018He was torn between the duties to his son and family and the foundation, and it tore him apart.\u2019 Over a four-year period, Paul gradually broke the links with his son and Lucy, opting to devote himself to the foundation. \u2018He would keep wanting to come out,\u2019 Lucy says. \u2018But they were told they had to stay in or else their energy would be diluted.\u2019 For a while there would be the odd, rambling letter to Lucy in which Paul tried to explain how the foundation was helping him \u2018find\u2019 himself. And then nothing: Paul was subsumed within the foundation. This is not surprising. Those with him in the foundation say Paul - like many others - was given no time for a private life; there was simply no space for it. The foundation maintains its followers are free to come and go when they want. But those who have left paint a different picture. They tell how Patel urges his followers to produce mountains of books, audio cassettes, teaching guides and yoga manuals, most of which are credited to him and sold in new age stores across the UK. Followers organise conferences, sponsored marches and charity fundraising events. Sleep deprivation is a common complaint; ex-followers claim they were expected to perform tasks at all hours of the day. Many grab a few hours\u2019 rest on floors, several to a room, wherever they can find space. Paul\u2019s home in the weeks before he died was often a caravan next to the foundation\u2019s capacious lodge in Yr Ocar, a couple of miles down the valley from its headquarters. The foundation denies its followers have a punishing workload. But it is clear from those who have left that they felt under pressure to meet Patel\u2019s high expectations. Jenny Clapham, who joined the foundation when she was 17, struggled to find the courage to leave for many months. According to her diaries, which she has shared with The Observer, the foundation made it clear to Jenny that leaving would jeopardise her relationship with Patel and, ultimately, her hopes of finding herself. \u2018According to Life doctrine, leaving the path of yoga would undo many lifetimes of hard spiritual work and there would never again be such a good opportunity with a guru,\u2019 Jenny writes. \u2018It was expected that the path would not be easy and to be a good devotee meant being strong enough to get through the \u201cchallenges\u201d and hard times. To leave would be to admit you were weak and not committed, even though you might be nearly at enlightenment.\u2019 A Life Foundation follower, Dr Allan Forsyth, who was with him shortly before he died, maintains Paul was treated as \u2018off sick\u2019. \u2018He felt that the Life Foundation was a refuge that provided fellowship support and a roof over his head,\u2019 Forsyth says. \u2018He had all the symptoms of serious depression and was receiving sympathetic support and encouragement from his friends and colleagues.\u2019 Paul\u2019s parents question why the foundation didn\u2019t try to contact them as his mental health deteriorated. Those who saw Paul tell of his increasingly disturbed state. One of the foundation\u2019s elders, Rita Goswami, would hold Paul in her arms and try to rock him to sleep. \u2018He would get to the point where he desperately needed to talk to somebody but he couldn\u2019t get the words out,\u2019 one person who was with him recalls. \u2018He was very isolated. He was living virtually on his own. He had become a very vulnerable character.\u2019 Goswami says Paul was encouraged to seek outside professional help, and that the foundation put him in touch with a range of therapists including an acupuncturist and a psychiatrist. A letter written by a foundation member, shortly before Paul killed himself, suggests many within the foundation knew he was in deep distress. \u2018My observation is that his condition is deteriorating... and it will continue to do so unless something dramatically changes,\u2019 the female follower writes. \u2018Can we really sit by and just let him rot? I will not be able to handle it myself (helping Paul) as I am on silence and trying to conserve energy in an attempt to heal my own body.\u2019 By the end, Paul\u2019s beliefs had become so confused he could not see how to resolve his increasingly corrosive relationship with the foundation. In a suicide note to his fellow followers he talked about his anguish at taking food that could go to them. \u2018Love is the way I know,\u2019 Paul writes. \u2018Gurudev [the guru] is the way I know. I feel tortured because I am unable to serve with the ability I know I can. Gurudev please free my mind.\u2019 After Paul\u2019s death, Patel told his followers that the Clarkes were grateful to the foundation for looking after their son for so long. \u2018Paul\u2019s life was extended many years longer than he should have been on earth,\u2019 Patel told his followers in a recorded speech. \u2018On my part I have nothing to grieve about, I have already given him an extended stay on earth, and already an extended opportunity. On my part, it\u2019s not a problem... I invite you to say that yes, it\u2019s an incredible blessing and joy. Paul himself is surrounded by light, you don\u2019t need to worry about that, that\u2019s not your job, that\u2019s my job because he\u2019s been ordained by me.\u2019 Whatever the truth, many of those who have left the foundation say Mansukh Patel is not the salvation they were led to believe. They claim he is in fact a sexual predator. Far from observing celibacy within the confines of the foundation, ex-followers claim Patel has his own harem of women often comprising the wives and girlfriends of his male followers. \u2018My guru and I were alone in a room, I had total trust in him,\u2019 recalls Jenny Underhill, now a Franciscan sister who left the foundation in 1987 after two years as Patel\u2019s PA. \u2018He asked me to give him a massage and he stripped naked. He then suggested I become more comfortable by taking off my clothes as well. He told me that I could do anything I wished to him... so I massaged and caressed his face. \u2018His next move was to suggest that if I wanted to be his \u2018Radha\u2019 I would have to complete the sexual act. At this point I gave in, believing he was doing it for my spiritual progress - after all, he was my guru.\u2019 \u2018I woke up one night to find him climbing into my sleeping bag,\u2019 another former female follower says. \u2018We had sex, I was half asleep. I was confused, I saw him as my guru. I thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d He just said, \u201cTrust me.\u201d\u2019 She felt this was his stock answer to every-thing. To refuse Patel\u2019s demands risked isolation, a withdrawal of the love and attention which his followers craved. Sue Turner left in 2003 after learning of Patel\u2019s sexual relationship with other female devotees. Only recently has her daughter, Heather, now a grown woman, confided to her mother that Patel started kissing her when she was around six or seven years old. Heather says. \u2018One time I slept in his bed. He told me he was going to take me to Disney World.\u2019 Although Patel did not have sex with Heather she became angry at the way her parents devoted themselves to him. \u2018Dad wouldn\u2019t stop smoking, but as soon as Patel asked him to he did. Then he asked him to become a vegetarian and he did. Whatever he said, they jumped. It was very frustrating as a child because they seemed to think more of this guy than me.\u2019 Goswami says the sexual allegations levelled against Patel are \u2018simply not true\u2019 and are \u2018distasteful\u2019. But many of Patel\u2019s followers have left as a result of the lurid claims. They say others want to break away, too, but have, like Paul, found it impossible. \u2018Some people want to quit but they can\u2019t because they don\u2019t know how to survive in the outside world,\u2019 one former follower recalls. \u2018It\u2019s so sad. We were swept away by love and a thirst for his attention.\u2019 Other former followers, however, defend the guru. Peter Legge, a devotee, wrote to The Observer saying,\u2019In my 64 years I have encountered no better living example of noble behaviour and conduct than Mansukh Patel... In my experience his selfless commitment to the welfare of other people is unfailing.\u2019 Ian Haworth of the Cult Information Centre sees things differently. \u2018We have been concerned about the activities of the Life Foundation for many years,\u2019 he says. \u2018I have received lots of calls from people concerned about the group, many of whom are ex-members. The concerns I have regarding this group are the same as those I have about much larger groups, such as the Moonies.\u2019 Margaret Clarke\u2019s face tells her own story. There is a sadness in her eyes that speaks of a mother\u2019s loss. And there is an anger as well, at the way the foundation treated her son, someone who was searching for answers, but instead received what she feels was only a relentless diet of gimcrack mysticism when he really needed urgent psychiatric help. It is only now, eight years since Paul\u2019s death, and now that his own son has become an adult, that Margaret and her husband have decided to break their silence. They hope that by telling Paul\u2019s story they can highlight how vulnerable people continue to be drawn to an organisation whose promises of inner peace are often at odds with the experiences of its followers. \u2018If we can just make one person aware of what happened then telling Paul\u2019s story will have been worthwhile,\u2019 Margaret says. Last month, as the Clarkes packed up their belongings to move to a new home away from so many bad memories, remnants of Paul\u2019s life emerged from the attic: the packet of seeds he sent his mother when he couldn\u2019t afford flowers; a letter to his father on his 60th birthday. Among the glossy brochures for the Life Foundation there are Paul\u2019s diaries and notebooks and tapes - lots of tapes - of his music. And there is one object the Clarkes packed more carefully than most. A porcelain statue of a saint, its shattered pieces glued back together with reverential care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
