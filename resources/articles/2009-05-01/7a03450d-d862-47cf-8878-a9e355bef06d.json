Curiously, Ishikawa has chosen to tell his \"true story\" in the form of a bad novel: names of people and institutions have been made up, and there is a lot of ineptly written detail, meant (one imagines) to be titillating, about the strippers and prostitutes with whom bankers and their clients apparently spent most of their leisure time, as well as hotels, champagne, Ferraris, yachts et cetera. The educational aspect of the book proceeds just a little better, with loving facsimiles of back-of-the-envelope diagrams illustrating the structures of the deals being invented and traded, though the acronyms tend to blur into one another after a while. The book's final message is contradictory: yes, the author admits, he and his colleagues \"caused\" the credit crunch; but they were only doing what anyone would do in their situation, and it was really the \"system\" that was at fault. As the crisis hots up in 2007, the hero applies a pungent Brazilian proverb (supplied by the pneumatic \"Tequila\") to events: \"What is a fart may as well be a shit.\" This seems to be the aesthetic principle behind the book as a whole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
