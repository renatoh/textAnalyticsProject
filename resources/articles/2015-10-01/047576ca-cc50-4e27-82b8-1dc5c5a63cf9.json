Took a lead role again, a day after he pledged to starve the press of \u201cgood and funny headlines\u201d. EMBLEM OF THE DAY Nemanja Matic, still embodying Chelsea\u2019s \u201cweak and naive\u201d start. A subbed sub against Southampton, he bounced back with two game-changing yellow cards. TOP PERFORMERS Jamie Vardy \u2013 the new Alan Shearer, say the stats; and Mesut \u00d6zil \u2013 who has the best games/assist rate since the Premier League began \u2013 one every 2.71 matches. PERK OF THE DAY Claudio Ranieri tried to coax a clean sheet out of his Leicester squad by offering to buy them pizza \u2013 and it worked. \u201cMaybe Vardy gets a bigger piece. One and a half.\u201d CHAIRMAN OF THE DAY Swindon\u2019s Lee Power: put himself in charge and earned a point against Joe Cole\u2019s Coventry. Stayed modest, too. \u201cThis is the day our season really started.\u201d SADDEST HOMECOMING Darren Ferguson played down the hype before heading back to old club Peterborough with new club Doncaster. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s just a case of going there, getting a result, wishing them all the best and moving on.\u201d They lost 4-0. REVIVAL OF THE DAY 2-0 down at home to Reading, it looked like mutual consent time for under-pressure manager Kit Symons. They ended up winning 4-2, via three goals in six minutes. AND FRESH FACE OF THE DAY Shola Ameobi, 34, joined Bolton\u2019s stable of former greats last week, and scored against Leeds. It was his first goal for 17 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
