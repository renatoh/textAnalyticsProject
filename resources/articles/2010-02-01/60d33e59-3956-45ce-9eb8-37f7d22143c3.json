After all, he is an England manager and as such, is prey to inevitable distress in a World Cup year. Capello is fitting into the same pattern as his predecessors, despite vain hope that he was radically different and would compel the universe to bow to his wishes. Certain elements have started to take on a statutory appearance. A player of high quality must go to the World Cup enveloped in doubts as to whether he is in any condition to meet its standards. David Beckham and Wayne Rooney were in that position when convalescing from metatarsal injuries in 2002 and 2006 respectively. In the interests of variety it is a broken ankle this year that has entered an outstanding footballer in that dreary event, the race against time. Capello will eventually have to rule on the extent of Ashley Cole's recovery and is unlikely to be as easily persuaded as Sven-Goran Eriksson was in the cases of Beckham and Rooney. The Italian, however, is not trapped merely in that cliche. The variety of trouble is unusually broad at this stage in the build-up. Capello will have been expecting much of the disruption. It cannot have shocked him to hear of the latest twinge in Rio Ferdinand's back and the suggestion that he may limit his international appearances in order to prolong his career. Ferdinand was expected to captain England against Egypt next Wednesday but has had only 11 outings for Manchester United in this campaign and will be absent from both that fixture and Sunday's Carling Cup final. It is never simple to contemplate the loss of a defender of such calibre, but the concern is keener still at a moment when England have such limited means. The Fifa rankings feel accurate in listing Capello's side ninth in the world. It is hardly a disgrace yet neither does it imply that England have the means to take the tournament by storm this summer. The anxiety now is that a lack of depth will be exposed. Capello has been loth to turn to the \u00a324m Joleon Lescott when one of the usual centre-backs has been absent, but it would not be ideal, either, if he had to count on Matthew Upson this summer. John Terry will be filling one of those positions at the World Cup, but there has been a disturbance to his season. Reports about his private life do not appear to have been shrugged aside as swiftly as might have been anticipated. By Terry's own admission, his errors at Everton cost Chelsea the match. Nor was he entirely assured in the recent win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Terry, of course, is very likely to regain the old reliability, but the defender has been shaken by the verdict of the England manager. Capello opted to take the captaincy from him, but it is a decision that is not wearing particularly well. Some managers might have ruled that a player's relationship with the former partner of an England team-mate was none of their business, even though Wayne Bridge seemed to believe that Terry's actions were relevant to him. It may be that, from Capello's perspective, the furore was one piece of disruption too many from his captain. There was nothing far-sighted about handing the armband straight over to Ferdinand. His back issue was well-known and now it will be Steven Gerrard who leads out England in next week's friendly. Just as well the Liverpool midfielder was found not guilty when people he had been with were convicted of affray over an incident in a bar. The present disquiet concerning Gerrard is associated only with indifferent club form that can be seen in the steep drop in his goals tally. All of that can come right before the World Cup and, when Capello ponders Liverpool, the primary interest may be in the anticipated comeback of Glen Johnson from serious knee damage. While the England manager could prefer a more conservative right-back in Wes Brown, it is still essential that he have as as many alternatives as is feasible. Capello, despite being well-versed in the vagaries of football, may feel jinxed in some regards. Theo Walcott still has the speed he showed in Zagreb, but not the precision or calm that devastated Croatia. That might have been met with a tolerant shrug if the manager could look to Aaron Lennon, but the Tottenham winger is yet to take the field in 2010 and has now had a setback in his effort to get over a groin problem. When he finally puts down a thick medical dossier, the England manager can start to reflect on more general topics such as the goalkeeper issue, with Joe Hart, on loan to Birmingham City from Manchester City, likely to be under consideration for next week's international. Capello is as beset by difficulties as any who preceded him, but there is a difference. The FA regarded him, with some cause, as the supreme manager and paid him accordingly. He is allowed everything, everything except even the most rational of excuses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
