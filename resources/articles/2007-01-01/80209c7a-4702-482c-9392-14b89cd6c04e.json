Gazprom had said it would cut off supplies to Belarus, also threatening fuel supplies to European countries served by the Belarus pipeline, if a deal was not reached by midnight last night. The five-year contract will require Belarus to pay $100 per 1,000 cubic metres, a steep rise on the previous tariff of $45, but a reduction from the $105 that Gazprom had demanded. The agreement requires Belarus to pay gradually increasing prices after the current contract until world market levels are reached by 2011. \"A mid-term agreement was reached on gas prices to Belarus and on transit shipments to Europe,\" Gazprom boss Alexei Miller told a press briefing at the Russian gas monopoly's headquarters. Gazprom will also be required to buy 50% of the shares in Beltransgaz, the Belarusian pipeline network. Gazprom had stipulated that Belarus pay $30 of the new price in Beltransgaz shares, but under the new contract Belarus will pay for the gas in cash and Gazprom will buy the pipeline shares in cash. On Friday, Belarus's president, Alexander Lukashenko, vowed that Minsk would not pay more than Russian consumers, saying that the two countries were members of a customs union. If no agreement had been reached, Gazprom said it would stop gas supplies to Belarus at 10am today. Minsk had threatened to freeze the transit of Russian gas to Europe through Belarus on the same day. Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov and Alexander Timoshenko, spokesman for the Belarus prime minister, had both committed to continue talks right to the deadline in order to resolve the crisis. Gazprom is trying to end heavy discounts to former Soviet republics and bring gas prices closer to world levels of about $230 per 1,000 cubic metres. Georgia recently agreed to raise the price it pays, but Azerbaijan is looking to buy Iranian gas instead. Mr Kupriyanov also stressed that the Yamal-Europe transit gas pipeline which runs across Belarus was the property of Gazprom, and that Minsk was obliged to allow unhindered transit of gas to western Europe. Two-thirds of the 45bn cubic metres of gas that Gazprom sold to Europe last year was pumped via Belarus through the Yamal-Europe pipeline. Some 20% of Russian gas exports to Europe - mainly to Poland, Lithuania and Germany - passes through Belarus. The other 80% flows through Ukraine. About one-quarter of natural gas consumed in Europe comes from Russia. Last year, in a similar dispute, Russia briefly shut off gas supplies to Ukraine, which led to supply disruptions to Italy, Austria and Hungary - for the first time since the 1980s when the Soviet Union first signed major contracts with European governments. That episode undermined Russia's reputation as a reliable supplier. In November, Richard Lugar, head of the US Senate's foreign relations committee, described Russia's energy policies regarding former Soviet republics and eastern European countries as \"geo-strategic blackmail\". Meanwhile, Belarus has reportedly been stockpiling oil and coal in recent weeks, which would have allowed its power plants to run without Russian gas for a while. \"We will live in dug-outs but we will not surrender to blackmail,\" Mr Lukashenko said on Friday. Although the price demanded by Gazprom is well below world market prices for natural gas, it still is likely to be a tough blow to Belarus. The country retains a mostly centralised, Soviet-style economy, and its industries depend on cheap Russian gas to be competitive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
