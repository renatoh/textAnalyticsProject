Last month, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, confirmed a Labour government would pilot UBI if it won a general election, identifying Liverpool and Sheffield as potential areas for pilot schemes. The plan would do away with the need for welfare as every citizen would be given a fixed sum to cover the basics, whether they are rich or poor, in work or unemployed. On Wednesday, senior city councillors agreed to work to ensure a UBI \u201ccan be implemented successfully in Sheffield\u201d. The politicians were persuaded by a detailed proposal put forward by UBI Lab Sheffield, a grassroots group of researchers and activists. They estimate a pilot involving 4,000 people would cost between \u00a318m and \u00a360m, depending on the extent of the scheme. Julie Dore, the leader of the Labour-controlled council, said she recognised the transformative effect UBI could have on the residents of Sheffield, particularly given increasing automation in the workplace. \u201cUBI has the potential to be a bold, radical change to how our economy and society works with benefits for people\u2019s wellbeing and how we support people in need,\u201d she said. \u201cIn order to face up to these realities, I think it is completely right that radical solutions are considered. \u201cAs a council, we are getting behind this and committing to looking at this further and working with a Labour government in trialling this.\u201d Sam Walby, a co-founder of UBI Lab Sheffield, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an idea whose time has come. It seems to have been included in a lot of new visions, whether that\u2019s for politicians or political writers. \u201cThere seems to be a common theme that\u2019s running through, which is, \u2018how do we reimagine the welfare state for the 21st century?\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re not saying this is a silver bullet that could solve everything, but we need to be exploring it. Some of its results might be completely surprising and unexpected.\u201d The cost of any future Sheffield pilot would be met entirely by an external funder, likely a national government, and not Sheffield city council, UBI Lab Sheffield said. McDonnell confirmed earlier this year that such funding could come from a future Labour government. \u201cI would like Liverpool \u2013 of course I would, I\u2019m a Scouser \u2013 but Sheffield have really worked hard. I\u2019ve been involved in their anti-poverty campaign and they\u2019ve done a lot round the real living wage,\u201d he said. Olivia Blake, the deputy leader of Sheffield city council, said she had invited McDonnell up to the city to \u201cdiscuss these radical proposals further\u201d. Jason Leman, the chair of UBI Lab Sheffield, said the city was uniquely predisposed to hold a pilot due to its geography. \u201cIt\u2019s like a collection of towns, it isn\u2019t a monolithic city. Every city has its neighbourhoods but Sheffield is particularly divided. There\u2019s a real disparity between the north-east and the south-west in terms of wealth, life expectancy and life experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin Sheffield\u2019s districts, you have communities that are almost self-supporting.\u201d UBI Lab will attempt to gather the support of organisations across the city, including both universities, the local NHS branch and small businesses, encouraging them to sign a pledge of support for the pilot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
