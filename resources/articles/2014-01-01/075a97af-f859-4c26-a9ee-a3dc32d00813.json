The former PE teacher turned local celebrity has already been intercepted inside by another stranger seeking a quick snap on his mobile phone. Next up is the female head teacher of a secondary school, keen for him to give a motivational talk. Everyone wants a piece of the Cumbrian farmer's son who, as recently as 2011, could have caught the match-day train to Twickenham unnoticed. By next year's Rugby World Cup he may struggle to leave his front door without a voice whispering: \"Are you going to win it, Stuart?\" from the shrubbery. All this is part of the unique pressure of coaching England in a high-profile team sport. The 44-year-old Lancaster is the first to admit it has not been easy at times since he took the role, initially on an interim basis, two years ago. \"The biggest reservation I had about myself was that I hadn't coached against any of the opposition teams. \"Because I hadn't played international rugby I hadn't even been to places like South Africa. I'd been to one or two Test grounds but I'd visited the bars more than the dressing rooms. I'd never been to many international games full stop. Suddenly you're looking at a map going: 'Where's Durban?' I feel a lot more comfortable now.\" That is just as well. By the time the 2015 World Cup comes around, the levels of interest in him and his players will have hit stratospheric levels. His childhood village of Culgaith in Cumbria, where he used to help milk his father's cows, will feel like a different galaxy. Can he rise above it all and produce not just a champion side at the 2015 Rugby World Cup but one capable of inspiring a nation? Tick both boxes and he will be confirmed as the most striking force for good in British professional sport in ages. It could be argued Lancaster already deserves that accolade. The cultural revolution within his squad has been startling. Every top team in the world have been beaten, with the exception of South Africa against whom England drew in Port Elizabeth in 2012. Now he is after a Six Nations title. \"I wouldn't go shouting about our internal objectives publicly but we want to go out and win a trophy. That's got to be our motivation.\" Win or lose, furthermore, he is the only home-grown international head coach in the UK and Ireland, with Wales, Ireland and Scotland now under southern hemisphere management. An irrelevant, parochial detail before the Six Nations? The precise opposite, according to Lancaster. For months he has been seeking ways to strengthen the 'emotional glue' between his players and the shirt they represent. England, for example, now have a heritage group charged with making the modern generation more aware of the forgotten heroes of yesteryear. Their top defensive performer also gains an award named after Arthur Harrison, the only England rugby international to have received the Victoria Cross. It is a fascinating development. The average Celt needs no excuse to dislike the English, let alone when they start declaring their love for Elgar, Churchill and bulldog spirit on the eve of a Six Nations championship. Lancaster, regardless, no longer expects his side to be 'out-passioned' by the Welsh or Irish. By 2015, ideally, he wants the mood on the streets of Albion to be akin to the heady days of Euro 96. \"It's probably a bit more challenging because of the nature of England as a country. But when I think of England at its best in sport \u2013 during Euro 96 or when they're doing well in the cricket \u2013 there is no better feeling. I remember Euro 96 vividly, particularly the sense of identity. We want to try to replicate that emotion and intensity.\" For years opponents have pondered what might happen if England did maximise their greater playing numbers and display the consistent purpose of, say, the All Blacks. While things did come together briefly between 2000 and 2003, Lancaster is laying foundations which are intended to sustain English rugby beyond 2019, never mind 2015. A voracious reader of sport-based motivational literature, he has a new keynote phrase: \"The more you have to play for, the better you play.\" Selection, discipline, fitness, teamwork and character all count but to him culture and identity are fundamental. Last year's heavy defeat by Wales in the Millennium Stadium heightened that belief. \"That sense of national pride in the Wales team was a force we didn't quite overcome. If players have a real commitment to the shirt and a desire not to let it down, it creates a higher level of determination to win.\" The supreme irony, of course, is that Lancaster represented Scotland at youth and student level through his Dumfries-born mother, Ann. It may help explain why new England squad members, regardless of birthplace, are now given an induction on arrival in camp. They also have to reveal three things others may not know about them. \"We're not talking about innermost secrets but just something to start conversations. The more you know each other, the more likely you are to play hard for each other.\" What three facts did Lancaster share? \"The majority of players probably wouldn't appreciate I was brought up on a farm, have an older brother and a younger sister and have another brother, 10 years younger than me, who's a barrister.\" He is also the most patient, organised, unflappable and hard-working of men. Even those sceptics who initially dismissed him as an inexperienced nonentity without the experience to coach internationally are changing their jaundiced tune. Belatedly they now realise what he is not: egotistical, financially motivated, power-crazed or weak. The bag Lancaster leaves behind when he goes to fetch two glasses of tap water would provide Sherlock with a clue or two. It is already fraying at the top of the straps, suggesting a frantically busy man unbothered by material things. Lancaster's mind palace is certainly full. Meetings, analysis, phoning club coaches, checking on injured players, media briefings \u2026 barely a minute is unaccounted for in his battered, magenta, A4-sized diary, held together with grey gaffer tape. He frequently rises at five and likes to complete a gym session before breakfast, not merely for his own personal benefit. \"I don't want to end up in two years' time breaking down through illness or whatever else because I haven't looked after myself. That wouldn't be much use to anyone.\" His wife, Nina, runs fitness boot-camps; last Wednesday evening he headed out to coach West Park Leeds U13s. Is this a family who ever lounge around together on the sofa? For the only time in an hour-long conversation Lancaster shuffles uneasily in his seat. \"I've got two kids who are 12 and 13. The reality is that during the Six Nations period, starting now, I'll be away until March 16. \"I'll come back home for the occasional day but, even then, your mind never stops. You're constantly thinking about different scenarios. My wife is used to me being away\u2026she usually goes on holiday with her friends during the Six Nations. We're not complaining because it was our choice; we went in with our eyes open. But I'm not sure how you can really prepare for it. And what we can't possibly appreciate is what it's going to be like over the next 18 months. The attention and scrutiny is going to magnify by 10.\" At least Lancaster knows how he wants his players to react. Display any sign of selfishness and they will be out quicker than you can throw a dwarf off a ferry. Perceived mavericks like Danny Cipriani will have to knuckle down like everyone else. \"I honestly don't think you can be a top-flight club player now and not be a team player.\" He does not foresee an English cricket-style meltdown \u2013 \"The best teams make changes before change is forced upon them\" \u2013 or any complacency. He is also determined to galvanise the grassroots game and leave opponents wondering what hit them. \"If you don't create a team with strong self-belief, you'll never be a strong, winning team. \"We just need to be careful that self-belief doesn't come across as arrogance because it's too easy a label to put against us. But equally we should have the strength of character that great English teams have had in the past. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio\u2026they weren't arrogant, they were just very good.\" Paris, though, has to be conquered first. Beat France away on Saturday week and a title could materialise if England defeat Wales at home. Stumble at the Stade de France and World Cup anxiety will rise. \"I'm sensible enough to understand that international coaching is a results-based business,\" says Lancaster. \"People will forget about the age and experience of the side if we lose. You can't go into a Six Nations game not caring if you win or lose. The priority has to be to win. On the other hand, I'd rather find out about players now than be sat here next January wondering if Anthony Watson is good enough.\" That constant nagging voice in his ear \u2013 'Are you going to pick the right side, Stuart?' \u2013 is not going to be hushed just yet.
