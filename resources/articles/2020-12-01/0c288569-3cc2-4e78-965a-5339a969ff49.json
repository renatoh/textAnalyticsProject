Fudge was first elected to Congress in 2008 to represent a district that includes Cleveland, and is a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Vilsack spent eight years as head of the US Department of Agriculture during the Obama administration and served two terms as Iowa governor. Their intended nominations were confirmed to the Associated Press on Tuesday by five people familiar with one or both of the decisions who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid preempting the president-elect\u2019s announcement. As other news outlets started reporting Fudge\u2019s selection as Hud secretary on Tuesday, Fudge said on Capitol Hill that it would be \u201can honor and a privilege\u201d to be asked to join Biden\u2019s cabinet, though she did not confirm she had been picked. \u201cIt is something in probably my wildest dreams I would have never thought about. So if I can help this president in any way possible, I am more than happy to do it,\u201d she said. A longtime member of the House agriculture committee and a fierce advocate for food stamps, Fudge was originally discussed to become agriculture secretary. But her name was later floated for Hud as Biden\u2019s team focused on other candidates for USDA, including Vilsack and the former North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp. Biden has said he wants a diverse cabinet, and some Black leaders have said he needs to do more to achieve that. He announced on Tuesday that he had selected the retired army general Lloyd Austin as defense secretary, who would be the first Black leader of the Pentagon. Fudge enjoys the strong backing of South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, the No 3 House Democrat who gave Biden a key nod of support in the primaries. Clyburn has aggressively pushed Fudge for USDA but seemed to back away from that post earlier on Tuesday. \u201cMarcia Fudge is a tremendous candidate. I was pitching her for the Department of Agriculture,\u201d Clyburn noted on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s where she will end up, but I feel certain that Marcia Fudge is the kind of person that should be in this cabinet and I will continue to advocate for her.\u201d Beyond Clyburn, she also had the backing of progressive groups for the USDA position. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in business from the Ohio State University and a law degree from the Cleveland-Marshall School of Law at Cleveland State University. Politico first reported the news of Fudge\u2019s selection. Biden\u2019s relationship with Vilsack goes back decades. He was an early supporter of Biden\u2019s first campaign for president in 1988 while Vilsack was the mayor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. He endorsed Biden a year before the 2020 election and campaigned tirelessly for him in Iowa, the nation\u2019s first caucus state. Biden has adopted aspects of Vilsack\u2019s rural policy agenda as Democrats look to make up ground they have lost to Republicans in rural areas over the past decade. There is little mystery to Vilsack\u2019s expertise after running the department for eight years under Obama and sitting at the table with Biden. Their 34-year friendship and longtime professional connection make the choice one offering little risk. Vilsack ran a 10-week campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination before withdrawing and throwing his support to Hillary Clinton. Vilsack was a finalist for Clinton\u2019s running mate that year. Politico first reported the news of Fudge\u2019s selection, while Axios was first to report Vilsack as agriculture secretary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
