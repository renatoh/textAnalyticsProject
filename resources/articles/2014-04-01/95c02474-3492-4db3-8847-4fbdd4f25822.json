Don't read on if you haven't seen episode one. \u2022 A (very) quick beginner's guide to Mad Men Here's how the opener to the seventh (and final season) of Mad Men went for me. Oh there's a fat man talking to camera about a watch \u2026 Swoon. I can't remember his name but I've definitely seen him before \u2026 Swoon. Peggy's telling him he's incredible, even though what he just said sounded to me like the kind of thing they can generate through a machine in a Patek \"you don't own it, you merely hold it for the next generation\" watch factory (swoon anyway). \"You really put the free into freelancer,\" Peggy says, as Fred (ah, that's his name \u2026) beds in for another coffee. She tilts her head as she says it, and I half-expect her to cluck, like a sexy older hen. But things aren't great for Peggy. She's hiding her sorrow under a crochet hat, which also alerts us to the arrival of the 70s. She's not hiding it very well. What she really needs is a balaclava. It reminds me a little of The Cat in the Hat. Specifically, the part where the Cat has picked up all the objects in the house but reckons he can still carry a fishbowl. Mad Men has made these characters so exquisite, so densely packed with feeling, so alert to the world, however pained by it, so difficult on top of all that, it wouldn't have been worth doing another series if not to add another dimension. The new dimension is: Let's take this person already loaded with baggage and see if it can carry a fish in a bowl. Meanwhile, Don's new thing is vanity. He is so unfeelingly good-looking that he is almost sadistic in the carelessness with which he wears his attractiveness. He has become one of those people who worry about chin wattle and still shag around. Can this possibly work? I only hope I can stay conscious long enough to find out (see \"swoon\"). Joan's new thing is the miniskirt. And so everything in her is conflicted\u2013 her powerful belief that she has always to be the first person to embody any new cultural direction at war with a noli me tangere body-as-power-struggle determination not to show her knees. Pete is now unbearable. Always on the cusp, it turned out that all it needed to push him over was the addition of plaid and the use of the word \"divine\". Ken Cosgrove \u2013 just one of those people who will always travel with their surname, probably even within their own families \u2013 has started to yell at people. A sort of nasty, imposing impatience that claims to be about a lack of time, but really is about a lack of status; it speaks of great disappointment, but then everybody is so disappointed in this show. If they all shouted, it would turn into a modern opera, which is perhaps an idea for a spin-off. Roger has fetched up in a threesome, or fivesome, or some unorthodox sexual arrangement to which the word \"some\" is typically suffixed. He keeps waking up in a roomful of naked people, tumbled sleeping on the floor, like socks. Did people really do this in the 70s? I know that's what they all say. I just don't completely buy it. Peggy, still racked over Ted, also has a vile new boss, Lou, from whom insults rain down with the nonchalance of bad weather: \"Oh it's nothing personal\"; \"I just seem to be immune to your charms.\" I will be sad if he turns out to be another pantomime sexist villain, to distract our attention when the rest of it becomes too complex. But I'm sure they will find some horrible death for him before that happens. What do you think to the new 70s-era Mad Man? What are your hopes for this final series?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
