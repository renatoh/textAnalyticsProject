We at SS Mary and John Church in Oxford conducted a pilot project of presence ministry in our churchyard over the summer of 2013. In a team including Rev Sabina Alkire, Ruth Conway and Rev Adam Romanis, my job was to conduct maintenance tasks in the churchyard, while positively engaging with churchyard users. This experience taught me that behind the rowdiness, such vulnerable groups are typically warm-hearted, friendly, wise and in desperate need of love. Boundaries and professional involvement are vital, and antisocial behaviour should be challenged, but as Christians we must cultivate the utmost love for all who come to our door, because \"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me\". Matthew 25:40. Daniel Emlyn-Jones Oxford"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
