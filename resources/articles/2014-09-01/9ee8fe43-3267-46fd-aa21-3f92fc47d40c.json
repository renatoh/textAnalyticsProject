In a blunt report published on Friday, the international development committee urged Britain\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) to place greater emphasis on building up weak health systems and to draw on the medical and managerial expertise of the NHS in doing so. \u201cThe devastating ongoing Ebola epidemic in west Africa has served to emphasise the importance of establishing strong health systems,\u201d it said. \u201cThe apparent hesitancy and lack of coordination in the international response suggest that the global health system and emergency plans have failed.\u201d While the committee described DfID as a \u201cworld leader\u201d in strengthening health systems, it said it feared the department\u2019s \u201ctarget-driven mentality\u201d. It added that work with large international partnerships whose focus is on getting rapid results by concentrating on specific, high-profile diseases had come at the expense of shoring up health infrastructures in poorer countries. According to the report, DfID spent \u00a3360m on supporting health systems and \u00a310m on health systems research in 2013-14. Over the same period, it provided \u00a3387m to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi); \u00a3543m to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and \u00a353m to Unitaid, the international organisation created to increase the supply of affordable medicines to the developing world. \u201cDfID has a good record on health but relies on international partners such as the Global Fund and the vaccine alliance to spend an ever greater proportion of the UK aid budget,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chairman, Sir Malcolm Bruce. \u201cTo date, these organisations have successfully delivered significant \u2018quick wins\u2019 by targeting Aids, malaria and TB.\u201d Bruce said the department needed to review its funding arrangements to ensure that aid money was being used to build stronger health systems, adding: \u201cIt must also be prepared to withhold funds from organisations unwilling to take this approach.\u201d The committee recommended that DfID become a \u201cmore vocal champion of health system strengthening on the world stage\u201d. This could be achieved by publishing more figures about its spending and performance \u2013 and by encouraging others to follow suit, it said. Another of the report\u2019s key suggestions was that the department make proper use of the skills and knowledge on its own doorstep. \u201cFor all the domestic criticism it gets, the NHS is internationally recognised as one of the best health systems in the world,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cYet DfID only makes modest use of the considerable expertise that resides within the NHS.\u201d The committee said the NHS had much to offer in both human and institutional expertise. Not only would encouraging more UK medical staff to volunteer overseas help share knowledge and skills, it would also benefit the NHS by building global contacts. Similarly, argued the committee, NHS administrative staff could offer advice on finance and management while also learning \u201cto tackle familiar problems in unfamiliar settings\u201d. Bruce said lessons had to be learnt from the Ebola epidemic, which has spread to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. It was, he said, \u201can avoidable tragedy that has served as a devastating reminder for what happens when health systems are weak\u201d. A DfID spokesperson said: \u201cDfID is a world leader in supporting developing countries to strengthen their health systems, improving facilities, management, staffing and access to supplies. The Ebola crisis demonstrates the vital importance of a fully functioning health system and the UK will continue to help affected countries to respond to the outbreak. \u201cMore than \u00a325m of British funding is supporting the global effort to contain Ebola, which also includes providing medical supplies, funding vaccine trials. In addition, British military and humanitarian experts will set up a medical treatment facility in Sierra Leone.\u201d International health agencies have been accused of responding far too slowly to Ebola. A month ago, Joanne Liu, international president of the medical charity M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, criticised the World Health Organisation for not declaring the outbreak an international public health emergency until 8 August, adding: \u201cI think the wake-up call was too late.\u201d On Wednesday, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it would spend $50m (\u00a331m) to support the emergency response to the outbreak."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
