Waving Czech and EU flags, demonstrators filled Wenceslas Square, the scene of euphoric rallies 30 years ago that ushered in the velvet revolution and ended communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia. Television footage showed crowds stretching the length of the square, a distance of nearly half a mile, bringing the city centre to a halt and fulfilling organisers\u2019 hopes of an impressive show of opposition strength. Holding banners saying \u201cResign\u201d, protesters \u2013 including some who had travelled from distant locations \u2013 voiced anger over Babi\u0161\u2019s continuation in office despite mounting scandals over the misuse of EU funds. The mixed social makeup suggested anger had reached beyond liberal, relatively cosmopolitan areas around Prague, where opposition to the prime minister has always been strong. \u201cHe\u2019s like a mafia boss and he\u2019s the worst politician in the Czech Republic \u2013 he reminds us of communism,\u201d said Dagmar Kmochova, a shop owner from Kutna Hora, a town 50 miles east of Prague. Feelings at Tuesday\u2019s rally \u2013 the latest in a series of anti-Babi\u0161 events \u2013 were running high after the leaked disclosure of a preliminary European commission auditors\u2019 report accusing the Czech leader of conflicts of interest over his ties to an industrial conglomerate, Agrofert, that receives large EU subsidies. Hours before the demonstration, Babi\u0161, the Czech Republic\u2019s second-richest man, launched a blistering counterattack, using a parliamentary debate to describe the report as an \u201cattack on the Czech Republic\u201d aimed at destabilising the country. That explanation cut little ice at Tuesday\u2019s demonstration, which followed four earlier rallies in the Czech capital in the past six weeks. \u201cBabi\u0161 is an oligarch. He is like [Silvio] Berlusconi but worse,\u201d said Vaclav Bozdech, a retired clerk, who was wearing a mask of the prime minister\u2019s face with the letters StB stamped on the forehead in reference to the prime minister\u2019s alleged role as a secret agent for the communist-era secret police. \u201cHe thinks he owns the Czech Republic and he isn\u2019t even Czech. He is a Slovak gangster and they were glad to get rid of him. He is like the hijacker of a plane and we are his hostages.\u201d A rally in Wenceslas Square two weeks ago attracted at least 50,000 people. Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Min\u00e1\u0159, a spokesman for A Million Moments for Democracy, the group organising the protests, told Tuesday\u2019s gathering it had doubled the previous attendance. He pledged to ratchet the pressure up further by announcing plans for an even bigger rally on 23 June in Prague\u2019s Letn\u00e1 Park \u2013 the venue of a rally in 1989 credited with presaging the final end of the communist regime \u2013 saying Wenceslas Square was no longer large enough to accommodate the growing protests. Babi\u0161, 64, who became prime minister in 2017, has repeatedly said he will never resign. After police recommended in April that he face fraud charges over alleged misuse of EU funds, he responded by sacking the justice minister in his coalition government and installing a close ally, Marie Bene\u0161ov\u00e1. Babi\u0161\u2019s opponents say the EC audit appears to uphold a complaint by Transparency International that the prime minister is breaking conflict of interest rules by retaining effective control of Agrofert despite supposedly putting it into a trust. \u201cMr Babi\u0161 is the beneficial owner of the Agrofert group companies and, since February 2017, of the two trust funds, which he fully controls, and therefore has a direct economic interest in the success of the Agrofert group,\u201d the commission report said. It said his government functions were \u201ccompromised\u201d by his involvement in budget decisions affecting Agrofert, and the Czech Republic could be forced to repay millions of euros in subsidies. David Ondr\u00e1\u010dka, the director of Transparency International in the Czech Republic, predicted Tuesday\u2019s protest would be a \u201cnail in Babi\u0161\u2019s political coffin\u201d. He said: \u201cHe cannot survive this public pressure and these EU reports. He knows that the EU budget and the Czech budget will no longer serve as an ATM where he can pick up whatever he needs. He will never surrender easily but with mounting public anger, smart opposition moves and proper institutional pressure I believe he will no longer be prime minister.\u201d Babi\u0161, who has dismissed the accusations as an \u201corganised plot\u201d, called the commission audit \u201cvery dubious\u201d and pledged the Czech Republic would not repay any subsidies. \u201cEuropean bureaucrats despise Czech laws. Brussels is interfering in our laws,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
