The five-year-old returned to Ascot to lift the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes but subsequently lost his form. Without a penalty in next Friday's Hardwicke he would be something to bet on if back to his best, but Doyen evidently has something to prove on that score. \"He has taken a long time to come to hand,\" said Simon Crisford, racing manager to Godolphin, after watching Doyen complete a gentle canter yesterday. \"It is all the more puzzling, as we deliberately gave him a long time off after he disappointed in the Champion Stakes. He's pretty fit, but he is a hard horse to weigh up at home and hopefully we'll find out more at the weekend.\" Dubawi, Shamardal and Subpoena all stood their ground for Godolphin at yesterday's five-day declaration stage for the St James's Palace Stakes. But the prospect of fast ground has put Dubawi's participation in doubt next Tuesday. \"It looks like being a bit quick for him,\" said Crisford. Aidan O'Brien, who rattled off a hat-trick in the St James's Palace with Giant's Causeway, Black Minnaloushe and Rock Of Gibraltar in 2000-02, can choose from Ad Valorem, Grand Central and Oratorio. Sundrop, so impressive at Epsom last week, was reported to be on target for Wednesday's Windsor Forest Stakes by Crisford. But it looks significant that she is one of four Godolphin acceptors for Tues day's Queen Anne Stakes. Rakti faces a possible 17 rivals for that Group One feature, but was yesterday installed the 11-8 on favourite by the Tote. Martillo and Valixir were both supplemented at a cost of \u00a320,000. At 10-1 with a run, Sundrop is worth a close look in the Tote's early prices. The same firm make The Tatling 5-1 favourite to follow up his victory last year in the King's Stand Stakes, in which Benbaun was a \u00a312,000 supplementary entry. It was announced yesterday that the Australian sprinter Fastnet Rock, forced to miss this meeting because of travel sickness, has been retired. \"The horse is looking and feeling great but hasn't recovered 100% from the bout of travel sickness he picked up on the journey here,\" said trainer Paul Perry's son, Shannon. \"Unfortunately we've lost the race against time to have him ready for Ascot and the July Cup at Newmarket so he'll retire straight to Coolmore Australia. As everyone there knows, he's a truly brilliant sprinter so it's a great pity he wasn't able to prove it up here.\" Following a hearing by the disciplinary committee of the Jockey Club yesterday, Michael Harris, former assistant to trainer John O'Reilly, was warned off for a year over the disappearance of My Bayard at Wolverhampton last November. The six-year-old, previously trained by O'Reilly, was taken from the Dunstall Park stable complex by Harris, following a dispute over ownership, an hour before what would have been his first race for the trainer John Balding. Harris was found to have breached the rules by gaining unauthorised access to the course stables with the deliberate intention of removing the horse. My Bayard, having been missing for almost four weeks, had to be put down due to colitis within days of his return to Balding's stable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
