That game was the first time Wolves had played in the Premier League for six years and, in the eyes of the manager, it showed in the mentality of his players. \u201cYou could see as a team we were nervous,\u201d Conor Coady, the Wolves captain, says. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, you always get butterflies before a game, but it was a little bit more than that and you could see it because it was our first game in the Premier League. Everybody was thinking about it, everybody was over-thinking their jobs and focusing on what they needed to do. You could see a little bit of anxiety.\u201d Nuno recognised the need to take away some of that tension and inject a shot of self-belief into his Championship winners. \u201cThe manager spoke to us and said: \u2018What are you like? Relax, they\u2019re not superheroes. It\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s 11 men against 11 men and we go and play how we play. And if we play well, we will win. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u2019 Since then, nothing has changed. There\u2019s not been one game where we\u2019re thinking: \u2018We\u2019re not going to win today.\u2019 We always believe.\u201d The fact Wolves have gone on to take points off Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal is evidence that any sort of inferiority complex has long disappeared, and judging by the loud cheers coming from another part of the training ground while Coady is talking, the mood among the players is about as relaxed as it could be. \u201cThat\u2019ll be head tennis,\u201d Coady says, smiling. It makes a change from cricket, which is played regularly in the gymnasium and has done wonders for team spirit but not a lot for the state of the ceiling. \u201cThe holes are bad, aren\u2019t they,\u201d says Coady, sounding like a naughty schoolboy. \u201cBig John Ruddy has a hard hit \u2013 he smashes it. The staff went mad when it first happened. But there are loads of holes now.\u201d Asked who explains the rules of cricket to Wolves\u2019 sizeable Portuguese contingent, Coady gives an answer that makes sense on one level but would probably go down badly with Geoffrey Boycott. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard, is it? You throw a ball and someone whacks it!\u201d Coady says, laughing. R\u00faben Neves, by all accounts, is the rising star among his countrymen. \u201cHe\u2019s good at everything,\u201d Coady adds. \u201cParticularly head tennis. Him and [Jo\u00e3o] Moutinho are at a different level to anyone else.\u201d While Neves and Moutinho are at the vanguard of the new hugely ambitious Wolves, Coady is part of the Old Gold and one of the few survivors from the pre-Nuno era. Signed three years ago from Huddersfield, who are Wolves\u2019 opponents at Molineux on Sunday, Coady arrived as a midfielder and even filled in as a right-back before Nuno made the inspired decision to convert the Liverpudlian into the central figure in a three-man defence. Coady, who had never played in that position before, has been a revelation ever since. \u201cWhen [Nuno] came in, he didn\u2019t have a conversation with me about [changing position] \u2013 he just put me there,\u201d Coady says. \u201cIt was in the first session and I thought to myself: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to get better and listen and learn.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t really matter to me where I played. When I saw a manager of his calibre coming in \u2013 what he had done at Porto and at Valencia \u2013 I wanted to be part of it.\u201d The 25-year-old had some useful experiences to draw on when it came to adjusting to the task of facing Premier League strikers, with memories of the days when Luis Su\u00e1rez tormented him in training at Liverpool still fresh in the mind. \u201cHe used to twist me inside out,\u201d says Coady, who made two first-team appearances for Liverpool. \u201cHe\u2019s a sensational footballer and it was never the happiest times coming in from training because he showed me up a few times. But I\u2019ve had a lot of years between then and now to improve as a footballer.\u201d The fact Gareth Southgate has spoken so positively about Coady, who captained England Under-20s at a time when Harry Kane and John Stones were in the team, has led many to believe a senior call-up may not be too far away. \u201cI love watching England and what they are doing,\u201d Coady says. \u201cBut I can promise you I\u2019ve not thought about anything that high. If it does come, it would mean I\u2019m doing OK at Wolves, so it\u2019s important I keep improving and listening to the manager here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
