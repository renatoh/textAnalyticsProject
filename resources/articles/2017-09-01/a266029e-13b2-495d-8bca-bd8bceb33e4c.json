In response to concerns from the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, about direct rule from London being reimposed on the province, the government emphasised there would be no joint authority as an alternative to devolution. The statement from the government suggests a possible rift between London and Dublin over what to do if the negotiations between the parties in Northern Ireland \u2013 principally the Democratic Unionists and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 fail to produce a compromise. Without a deal between parties represented in the Northern Ireland assembly that would bring back power-sharing, the government said: \u201cWe will never countenance any arrangement, such as joint authority, inconsistent with the principle of consent in the [Good Friday/Belfast] agreement.\u201d The government said it was for the UK administration alone \u201cto provide the certainty over delivery of public services and good governance in Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom. This is consistent with our obligations under the Belfast agreement\u201d. The statement on Tuesday appeared to be a robust riposte to Coveney\u2019s statement earlier in the evening that \u201cthere can be no British-only direct rule. That is the Irish government\u2019s position\u201d. The British government statement said that its objective was still to ensure the return of devolved, local power-sharing government in Belfast. Earlier on Tuesday, Gerry Adams revealed that he is putting plans in place to eventually stand down as leader of Sinn F\u00e9in. Adams, who has been Sinn F\u00e9in president since the early 1980s, said he will give further details about retirement after the party\u2019s annual conference \u2013 Ard Fheis \u2013 in November. Power-sharing government has been suspended since the beginning of 2017, after the late Martin McGuinness withdrew from the post as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland. McGuinness resigned after Arlene Foster refused to temporarily stand down from office while an inquiry was held over a controversial and costly renewable energy scheme which the DUP championed in government. Under the rules of devolved power-sharing, if the leading representative of one section of the community resigns from office the entire administration falls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
