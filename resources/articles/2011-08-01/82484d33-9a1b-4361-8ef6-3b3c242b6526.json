After 11 injury\u2011free years he has suffered a run of severe bad luck, although he has continued to win more medals. His Olympic tally stands at 11 golds, including four in Beijing, as well as four silvers and a bronze. Most of that haul of precious medal was achieved in freestyle events. The Welshman, diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 11, has endured a frustrating period of rehabilitation over the past year. Shortly after winning gold while only at 75% fitness at last year's world championships, he fractured his elbow and severed a nerve in a freak training accident after clashing arms with another swimmer. He has only been back in training a month: \"Everything was going so well. It was devastating. It's almost like learning to swim again. But I suppose I would rather be injured this year than next, that's the only way to look at it.\" Regaining full fitness will be a long process and he and his coaches are targeting December to be \"firing on all cylinders\" ahead of the Olympic trials in March. \"If you live with your demons, they'll eat you alive. I have to roll with the punches and carry on. If it wasn't a home Games, maybe we'd have walked away. But London is too big a beast to walk away from.\" Roberts admits the prospect of breaking Grey-Thompson's record is a \"huge thing\". Struggling to be heard over the occasional roar of the National Lottery hot air balloon moored behind him, which is about to embark on a national tour to promote the part that lottery income has played in funding Olympic and Paralympic sport, Roberts is aware of his role as one of the most experienced members of the squad. He believes that momentum has been maintained since the high watermark of Beijing in terms of promoting awareness and recognition for Paralympic sport in Britain. \"You only have to look at the number of adverts on television featuring Paralympic athletes. A lot of the bigger sponsors are looking at Paralympic athletes as a real viable option,\" he says. \"People are getting an opportunity not only to see the sports but to get to know the athletes, and I think that is a big thing.\" For all the talk of the Paralympics being a huge opportunity, Roberts says it's also important to remember how far things have come. He has seen huge changes in the professionalism, investment and support surrounding Paralympic athletes since his first Games in Sydney. Most strikingly, he says, the average age of the swimming squad has plummeted as young talent has thrived. \"We're the envy of the world, really. If you look at how far ahead we are, other countries are copying what we do. It's not often you can say that in British sport.\" As with their Olympic counterparts, homegrown Paralympians will be under the spotlight as never before in 12 months time \u2013 none more so than multiple medallists such as Roberts, David Weir and Lee Pearson. The British Paralympic Association is drawing up programmes to help them deal with the pressure \u2013 and to support their friends and family. But Roberts insists that high expectations will not be a problem for him. \"Pressure is what I live for. It's a great thing. I could have sloped off after Beijing, but that's not me. I want 12, that's why I carried on. As it gets closer, the pressure will get more intense. I knew that was going to be the case. I enjoy it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
