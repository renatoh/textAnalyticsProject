No one will tempt me off his horses'", "bodyText": "When he contemplates the form figures resulting from his 13 attempts on the Grand National, Tony McCoy could, if so minded, take a perverse pride in having racked up almost the full set of letters. There is F for fell \u2013 five of those \u2013 U for unseated, P for pulled up and, a collector's item, C for carried out. Almost the only thing missing is R for refused. Any horse combining cowardice with a little wisdom would presumably rather face the fence than a wrathful McCoy. With this year's race a fortnight away, the champion jockey is in irresistible form. Having pulled off what was, by common consent, the best ride at the Cheltenham Festival when driving Wichita Lineman to a narrow victory, he achieved a still less likely success at Chepstow on Wednesday after his mount traded at 999-1 on Betfair in mid-race. The next day, he won at Ludlow despite the bit having slipped through his horse's mouth, leaving him with minimal steering. But his famous determination does not, apparently, extend to securing himself the best mount in the Aintree race. When Frankie Dettori finally bagged himself a Derby at the 15th attempt, it was because his principal employer allowed him to get on a fancied horse for another owner. McCoy's loyalty to JP McManus prevents him from doing something similar. \"There's lots of times when I've got off horses of JP's, when he's kindly let me off, but I would much rather ride a 50-1 shot of his than ride the 6-4 favourite,\" he says, quietly, but with total authority. \"So it won't ever happen, as far as I'm concerned. Because I know what the Grand National means to him and no one will ever tempt me off one of his horses, no matter how good a horse they think they have.\" That may mean that McCoy, who will be 35 in May, will never get the moment of Aintree glory he surely craves. McManus has had a handful of top-quality runners but there have been plenty of slow ones as well and his relationship with McCoy has not been nearly so fruitful as, say, Ruby Walsh's tie-up with Paul Nicholls. If he had not pushed Wichita Lineman's head in front with inches to go, McCoy would have endured a blank Festival, while Walsh rode a record-breaking seven winners. And McCoy's National record may be poor but McManus's is worse, with 22 losers in the past seven years. \"From a public perspective, the Grand National is the biggest race of all and not to have won it yet is definitely a failure,\" the jockey reflects. \"But there's been a lot of jockeys every bit as good and better than me that haven't won it \u2013 John Francome, Peter Scudamore, Jonjo O'Neill, Charlie Swan, to name a few. And what I have for a little while yet that they haven't got is another chance.\" Walsh has two National winners to his name and McCoy does not mind admitting he would like to be in that position. \"Of course you get jealous,\" he concedes. \"But you've got to admire how good a jockey he is as well and at the moment he's very lucky that he's riding two of the best horses [Kauto Star and Master Minded] that we've seen for a long time. \"I was lucky enough to ride Master Minded earlier in the season and you can only dream about having horses like that. We all have our different jobs and I love the job that I'm doing because I'm working for a great man \u2013 while he's happy with me riding his horses, I'll always be happy.\" McManus has six horses still entered in this year's National and a decision as to which will carry McCoy will be left until nearer the time. Many feel the decision is a foregone conclusion, as Butler's Cabin is by far the shortest in the betting at 12-1, but the jockey has an open mind. \"I haven't spoken to JP about it yet and you have to look at all the pros and cons. King Johns Castle was second last year, and you'd have to think about L'Ami as well.\" In last year's National, an early fall from L'Ami ended the career of Mick Fitzgerald, who suffered spinal injuries. McCoy, however, seems impervious to such an ill omen. \"Fitzy's one of my best friends, but what happened last year doesn't make me think, I'm not riding L'Ami. If L'Ami's the one, then L'Ami's the one.\" As to tactics, McCoy appears a little baffled. Asked what he has learned from the National over the years, he replies: \"Absolutely nothing, because I've tried everything. I went down the inside, thinking it was the place to go, and the horse fell. I think both years I rode Blowing Wind, I went down the outside. \"You start off thinking, I'll try and get a clear run ahead for five or six fences until it thins out a little bit because there's a few fallers, then you can make your way to the inside or the outside. But I'm probably not the right person to ask about it because I haven't won it.\" As if there were not already enough pressure on him, Racing UK, a satellite TV channel, is offering new customers a bonus in the event that McCoy can land this year's National. Anyone who signs up between now and 3 April, the day before the race, will have their year's subscription refunded. \"They're only doing it because they know they won't have to pay out,\" McCoy mocked yesterday, posing with a list of names that reached halfway up the Newbury grandstand \u2013 the horses on which he has been beaten in the race. The form figure for his 2009 mount was left as a question-mark. \"You couldn't make that a one?\" he said, and then made his own sign for \"one\" when his request was turned down. \"Everyone else is laughing, I might as well.\" McCoy's Grand National record 2008 Butler's Cabin fell 10-1 2007 L'Ami 10th 14-1 2006 Clan Royal 3rd 5-1 2005 Clan Royal carried out 9-1 2004 Jurancon fell 10-1 2003 Iris Bleu pulled up 8-1 2002 Blowing Wind 3rd 8-1 2001 Blowing Wind 3rd 16-1 2000 Dark Stranger unseated 9-1 1999 Eudipe fell 10-1 1998 Challenger Du Luc fell 12-1 1997 no ride 1996 Deep Bramble pulled up 12-1 1995 Chatam fell 25-1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
