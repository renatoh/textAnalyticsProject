But the Yorkshire city insists it already has a contract to host the event. \"I personally find Edinburgh's claim puzzling, not only because Sheffield is considered by the snooker world to be the spiritual home of the sport but also because we have just begun a new five-year contract to stage the event,\" said David Fletcher, director at Sheffield First for Investment. Sir Rodney Walker, the chairman of World Snooker, was also nonplussed by Edinburgh's claim but did admit that the city could feature on the sport's calendar. \"World Snooker would like to think that our long and successful association with Sheffield will continue well into the future,\" he said. \"However, we are pleased to hear of Edinburgh's interest in snooker and we would be happy to talk to the venue about other tournaments.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
