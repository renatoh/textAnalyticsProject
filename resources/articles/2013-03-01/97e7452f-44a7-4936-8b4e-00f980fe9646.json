A campaign studded with high-profile errors has turned the happy-go-lucky personality whose ebullience radiated from pitch to press conference into a more wary character. Hart now faces questions about being the victim of his own high standards and feels forced to state he does not need to reinvigorate himself. The sense is that consistency has dipped and Hart is in the serious business of having to prove himself for club and country. At Manchester City a view grows that he requires sterner competition than Costel Pantilimon, who has not started a league game in two seasons at the club. For England Hart has witnessed Roy Hodgson actively pursue Ben Foster to persuade the West Bromwich Albion keeper to end a three-year international retirement and join Fraser Forster as a rival for his No1 jersey. Asked if Foster's addition will provide healthy competition, Hart offers a prickly response: \"I'd imagine so. Whether it's just me here or 10 goalkeepers or whatever, I'll always train the same, try the same and give what I've got. I don't need reinvigorating. I train hard, I work hard, I want to play well. I try and play well no matter who is doing what. \"But Ben adds to the squad and that can only be a positive thing. He's a good goalkeeper, simple as that. Most managers would rate him. I rate him. I get on with him on a personal basis. Fraser's been doing well at Celtic and people forget about him. We're all pushing each other and we all want that No1 spot.\" As England prepare for two crucial World Cup qualifiers \u2013 against San Marino on Friday and Montenegro on Tuesday \u2013 Hart says of his naysayers: \"People are free to criticise or praise. I'm never going to tell anyone what to say or do about me but at the same time I don't have to listen. I'm pretty strong with how I feel about what I should and shouldn't have done.\" Surprisingly Roberto Mancini has emerged as a chief critic. Their relationship is strained due to the City manager's penchant for publicly voicing dismay at Hart's errors. These include howlers that allowed Sunderland's winner in the 1-0 defeat on Boxing Day and last month's 3-1 defeat at Southampton, when Hart was culpable for the second goal. At international level there have been squeaky moments too. Before England's qualifier with Poland on 17 October Roy Keane branded him \"cocky\" and, in a prescient critique, suggested: \"He needs a bit more competition.\" Following the match Hart was forced to apologise after his misjudgment at a corner allowed Kamil Glik to equalise as England dropped two points. The following month Hart was again shaky, at fault for at least two of the goals, as Sweden scored four. This caused Hodgson to defend him. \"We'll have a lot of success with him in the goal, even if this wasn't one of his best nights,\" the manager said. Asked if he is a better goalkeeper than last season, Hart says: \"I'd like to think so. I don't know whether I'm better but I'm working on addressing certain situations. I'm working with the same appetite, the same hunger, the same love for the game, the same will to win.\" Is Hart the victim of his own standards? \"Victim? I'm definitely not a victim. I have to accept when I'm playing that there's going to be another side and you have to take that sometimes.\" Ashley Cole and Steven Gerrard have each recently reached 100 caps. At only 25, and with 28 appearances, is Hart set on joining them? \"Not really, I'm still focusing on getting 29 and 30,\" he says. \"I'm only thinking about staying in the side for England and City, trying to be the best I can. I'm in that privileged spot at the moment. I didn't dream of this spot because I didn't think it would happen. That No1 spot is one I want to keep.\" A truism runs that any mistake from a goalkeeper is highlighted as these often lead to goals. Yet moments of brilliance are also illuminated as they can win matches. For England one has to flick back only to the last game, when Hart's impressive double save from Ronaldinho's penalty ensured Brazil were beaten 2-1. And he was the hero of City's 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund last autumn in the Champions League, of which Hart says: \"That was probably one of my better games.\" England are two points behind Montenegro, so wins in Serravalle and Podgorica to take six points would place them back in charge of Group H with only four matches left. Brazil 2014 would be in touching distance. \"It does sound good, a World Cup in Brazil,\" Hart says. \"I like the ring of it, the colours and the place, the football side of it. But if you go there thinking that, then it's half the battle lost because you have to concentrate on what we're doing. \"Honestly, if the World Cup was in Greenland, the North Pole, it would be the same desire. It's a World Cup for England, the desire just burns. But you can't get carried away until you've got that Q [qualified] next to your name and you're going.\" And to arrive there still as England's incumbent No1 is Hart's desire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
