Today he is a Denmark international with 44 caps. He has played in the World Cup and European Championship and he has won three Dutch championships. Dispensing with the text books was a wise decision for the winger who joined Charlton from PSV Eindhoven in a \u00a32m transfer this summer. \"Until I was 17 I just played football with my friends,\" he says in perfect English. Only after a fellow student urged Rommedahl to join him at Lyngby's youth team did football replace business as the Dane's chosen profession. \"One day the first-team trainer said I could train with them. I did well and so he said: 'You can come back tomorrow and train again.' After that I signed my first youth contract and nine months later PSV came in for me. In Denmark they call it the fairy-tale story - from nothing to the biggest talent in nine months.\" It is easy to understand why the Dutch found Rommedahl's fairy tale difficult to believe. In the Netherlands young players receive intense technical coaching well before their teenage years, yet here was a teenager who had been more interested in exchange rates than mastering the Cruyff turn. Initially Rommedahl found PSV a little overwhelming. \"It was difficult,\" he says. \"I was young and they had all the great names there: Jaap Stam, Arthur Numan, Luc Nilis.\" But he soon became an integral part of the team as Eindhoven broke Ajax's stranglehold on the Dutch league with three titles in four seasons. All of which begs the question, why leave? \"I want to try another way of playing football. In Holland it's all the same. In England it's all the same but it's different and that's why I wanted to come here, to try to develop my game with a new style of football.\" Rommedahl's experience of English football has been restricted to pre-season friendlies but he already knows what the \"new style\" entails. \"In Holland it's a much more patient game. Here it's all right to kick it long to the striker. If you do that in Holland three times the coach will say: 'Come on, play football.'\" Nevertheless the Dane is comfortable in his new surroundings, even if his decision to join Charlton was slightly surprising. \"I followed English football in Holland and I know Claus [Jensen] and, when Charlton came in, I talked to Claus about the club and he told me some good things and this was one of the main reasons that I chose Charlton.\" Jensen has since joined Fulham - something Rommedahl says he was aware of before he signed. However, the Dane has no reason to feel lonely. The Denmark international Stephan Andersen is Charlton's reserve goalkeeper, and his former PSV team-mates Arjen Robben and Mateja Kezman joined Chelsea in the summer. Rommedahl could have been forgiven for thinking that he might have attracted a similarly high-profile suitor. \"If you go to a top-three club maybe you will never play there,\" says Rommedahl. \"I'm 26 and I don't need that any more. I could do that when I was 20 like Robben is doing right now. If he's not playing in the first year he can develop his game and maybe next year he can play. I'm at that age when I just need to play every week.\" Rommedahl smiles at the contrast between PSV's state-of-the-art training facility and Charlton's equivalent. \"Here it is old but I like it. I think it's really English,\" he says. Having played under Bobby Robson at PSV he is well qualified to understand \"really English\". Mention of the Newcastle manager prompts laughter. \"He is a real gentlemen, a funny guy and he always had a story or two,\" says Rommedahl, smiling. At PSV he gained a reputation for being dedicated, often staying on the training field after his team-mates had finished. \"It takes just 10 minutes to go and cross 50 balls,\" says Rommedahl. \"If you do that every day, then in a year or two you will get better for sure.\" A mention of London's traffic brings a frown to his face for the first time. \"I have to get used to it\" -much like Premiership defenders have to get used to his pace. Rommedahl is widely quoted as having a time of 10.2sec for the 100 metres. \"That's not true because I think the fastest time for a Danish 100 metres runner is 10.36, so if I ran 10.2 I would be in Athens.\" It did not take long for the smile to return."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
