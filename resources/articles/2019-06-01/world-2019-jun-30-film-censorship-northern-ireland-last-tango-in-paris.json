Conservative religious and political leaders from both sides rallied to block Last Tango in Paris and other \u201cevil\u201d films in the 1970s that were deemed threats to morality, according to new research. Protestant churches in particular sought to create a de facto cultural border along the Irish sea to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, said Sian Barber, a film studies lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \u201cIt\u2019s the classic have your cake and eat it: \u2018we want to be part of things but we\u2019re different and you need to understand that,\u2019\u201d she said. Drawing on archives at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland, Barber uncovered an energetic censorship campaign by local authorities that overrode decisions by the London-based British Board of Film Classification. The board passed Last Tango in Paris, Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s erotically charged 1972 arthouse film, which starred Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, with an X certificate. Critics called it an important work. \u201cToo important not to be shown,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s reviewer, Richard Roud. It was screened in England, Scotland and Wales but banned in Northern Ireland after opposition by local councils. Belfast city council \u2013 making time for cultural gatekeeping amid a virulent IRA bombing campaign \u2013 went further and proposed banning all X-rated films in the city. Catholic and Protestant clerics cheered the plan. \u201cWe congratulate you for having the courage to act in the face of the opposition [of] the forces of evil that would corrupt the morals of our youth under the guise of sophisticated art,\u201d said the Eastside Church of Christ. \u201cMany of the X films being shown in our city constitute a danger to the moral life of our community,\u201d said the Cregagh Methodist church. The Festival of Light, a grassroots Christian campaign led by Mary Whitehouse and other activists in England, fuelled the censorship drive by distributing purportedly obscene extracts from the Last Tango script. Its tactics flopped in places such as Oxford but gained traction in Northern Ireland, said Barber, who investigated archive material for a pending book about UK-wide film censorship. \u201cThere was this huge backlash against the film based on word of mouth. It was much more extreme than other cases.\u201d Not everyone in Northern Ireland supported censorship. The Ulster Defence Association, a loyalist paramilitary group, objected in the mistaken belief that Belfast city council\u2019s police committee, which classified films, was bowing to Catholic pressure. The misapprehension turned the UDA into a menacing advocate for cultural liberalism. \u201cIf these pictures are banned in Belfast, we will burn out every member of the police committee,\u201d it said in an unsigned letter. \u201cWe know all their names and homes, we fought for Ulster\u2019s freedom.\u201d Belfast\u2019s cultural guardians must not follow the example of \u201cPope-heads\u201d in Derry who banned X-rated films, it warned. \u201cWatch your step, it will not be long till the dark nights.\u201d Belfast city council dropped the idea of banning all X-rated films but did deny an exhibition licence to Last Tango in Paris. Queen\u2019s film theatre circumvented the ban by temporarily licensing itself as a cinema club, enabling it to host a screening. Brexit has put renewed scrutiny on Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. The Democratic Unionist party rejects any deal that would treat Northern Ireland differently lest this weaken the union with Britain. However the party defends an abortion ban that sets Northern Ireland apart from the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland\u2019s history of film censorship \u2013 dating from the 1920s through to the 1980s \u2013 reflects the strength of religion and social conservatism, with churches, town councils and newspapers all playing a role, said Barber. \u201cThey argued \u2018we are different, we need additional levels of protection.\u2019\u201d Sometimes local authorities bucked the trend. Derry granted a licence for Life of Brian, the 1979 Monty Python comedy about a man mistaken for the messiah. The decision aligned Derry with liberal opinion elsewhere in the UK but, according to Barber, it may have been an expression of intra-city rivalry. \u201cIt was seen as a poke in the eye to Belfast.\u201d Different councils were bothered by different things. Authorities in the border town of Newry were so aghast at the sexualisation of Jane Russell in the 1943 western The Outlaw, they made a pre-emptive ban before any attempt to distribute it. And the seaside town of Bangor waged a vigilant campaign against nudist films, including the 1954 Garden of Eden. Hostility to films perceived as highly sexual or blasphemous often mirrored censorship in the Republic of Ireland, where the state watchdog banned The Outlaw, Brief Encounter, Life of Brian and the 1932 Marx Brothers comedy Monkey Business, the latter for fear it could encourage \u201canarchic tendencies\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
