The Canadians Jamie Sal\u00e9 and David Pelletier were edged out of the gold on Monday by the Russians Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze to loud boos from the crowd in what many neutral observers saw as a judging scandal. After a routine judges' meeting to look back at the voting the ISU said yesterday: \"Following the reaction of the public and the media to the results of the pairs event, and to respect public opinion, the ISU is doing an internal assessment to monitor if the ISU rules and procedures have been respected. Any further comment will be given when appropriate.\" Skating is no stranger to controversy. Four years ago in Nagano it was alleged that some judges predetermined the outcome, and in the 1999 world championships two judges were suspended for signalling to each other during the pairs event. But this is its biggest row since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, ice dance champions in 1984, returned to competition 10 years later and were denied the gold. \"I'm embarrassed for our sport right now,\" said Sandra Bezic, NBC TV's skating commentator. And Dick Pound, the former International Olympic Committee vice-president, said the sport might lose its Olympic status if the judging issues were not addressed. The capacity crowd of 10,700 in the Salt Lake Ice Centre were in no doubt that the Canadian world champions had won after a flawless routine to music from the film Love Story. But Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, Olympic silver medallists in 1998, were ranked first by five of the nine judges to become the 11th pair running from the Soviet Union or Russia to claim the title. The verdict led to a storm of booing and Sal\u00e9 breaking down in tears. \"It was like a punch in the stomach,\" said Pelletier. \"The Olympic dream can sometimes turn into an Olympic nightmare. What we can't control, we can't control. Our silver is worth a gold to us.\" This was the first time at an Olympics that fans at the rink did not know whom they were directing their displeasure at after a decision by the ISU not to display judges' nationalities on scoreboards at rinkside. The score sheets showed that the scoring, currently reckoned in placing rather than points, had split mostly down the lines of old cold war allegiances. The Russians were placed first by the judges from Russia, China, Poland and Ukraine, with the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan preferring the Canadians. In effect, contrarily, the French judge swung the decision in favour of the Russians. \"It's always perceived that, when the Russians win, it's the eastern bloc,\" said their coach Tamara Moskvina, who has now trained four Olympic pairs champions. \"Well, the Canadians' win at the world championships in Vancouver was also a controversial one, so there is always going to be controversy. Yelena and Anton have more speed than the Canadian pair, they have better steps, more variations and their lifts are stronger.\" Earlier Sikharulidze and Sal\u00e9 had collided during warm-ups, sending both sprawling to the ice on their hands and knees. Berezhnaya rushed to her partner's aid. In 1996 she was temporarily paralysed when, practising a camel spin, she lost control and her former partner's skate sliced through her skull. The injury required emergency brain surgery but she recovered to win silver in Nagano with Sikharulidze. Gold here completed a long and difficult journey, which included a three-month drug ban in 2000 for ingesting a banned substance in an over-the-counter cold cure. \"It was a gold-medal performance,\" insisted Sikharulidze, who had a minor slip on landing his double axel. \"We tried to skate with emotions, with everything. There was no fall, no big mistake. If something was wrong with my jump, it was a minor thing.\" The Canadians' programme was brilliantly athletic and magnetically romantic. The couple looked like a young Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neal as they covered the ice in perfect harmony. At the end of the 4-minute routine Pelletier sank to his knees and kissed the ice in celebration of what he believed was a gold medal. Sal\u00e9 turned to the thousands of Canadian fans in the arena and pumped her arms. \"Six, six, six,\" the crowd roared. Jubilation turned to anger, though, as they watched the marks flash up in the \"kiss and cry\" area and it became clear the Canadians had not won. But then Love Story did have a sad ending. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
