It gets the look and feel of the Super Nintendo and Game Boy eras of Zelda exactly right: a tiled, bird\u2019s-eye-view world of chunky sprites and squat, little adventurers. Delving into it with Link, Zelda and NecroDancer star Cadence is a delight. In combining an old-school Zelda adventure with rhythm-driven monster-bashing, Brace Yourself Games enlivens both. Through banging remixes of thrillingly familiar tunes from Zelda history, Cadence of Hyrule turns the series\u2019 simple sword-fighting into fast-paced musical chess. Each screen is festooned with little pixellated enemies who move to the music: Moblins wind their little clubs up for a hit every other beat; skeletal warriors and mummified zombies plod ominously towards you; spider-like Tektites move diagonally. Each beat, you can move, attack or defend. When the tempo is high and the enemies plentiful, you have to absorb and react to the position of everything on the screen in a fraction of a second, which made me feel like a rave-powered tactical genius. If that sounds too hectic, there is an option to turn off the rhythm-based element, letting you move and plan at your own pace. At the beginning, when Hyrule is unmapped and full of secrets, it feels dangerous and difficult, unexpectedly capturing the danger and mystery of the original Legend of Zelda, in which you were given a sword and told to head off in any direction you wanted. Death comes often, but as you explore the map, stuffing your pockets with charms, bows, bombs and heart pieces that make the journey easier, you\u2019ll stay alive for longer, discovering dungeons that are slightly different each time and boss monsters who challenge your confidence. Instead of wearing thin, the rhythm-based gimmick enhances everything it touches. Cadence of Hyrule is a potent combination of nostalgic looks, creative takes on emotionally charged Zelda music and unusual, rhythm-powered moment-to-moment play. Stylish and excellent fun, this tribute captures the excitement and sense of discovery that makes Zelda what it is: a real adventure. Cadence of Hyrule is out now; \u00a319.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
