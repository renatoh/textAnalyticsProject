Peter Trego's six for Somerset at Taunton that smashed the commentary box window and clouted BBC Wales's Edward Bevan on the back had already provided a salutary lesson that taking cover early is a better course of action than adopting a General Custer view of duty. But a four\u2011month\u2011old baby did not have that choice last week, when he was struck in his home near Barnsley after a six soared out of the ground during a match between Darfield and Brodsworth Main, bounced over the wall and road, through an open door, and hit him on the forehead while in the supposed sanctuary of his mother's arms. Fortunately the baby was unharmed, but it does go to show that you are never really safe when stationed within range of a flashing bat. I have bitter experience of this, having twice been clobbered in the face during school games. The first was my own fault for adopting a Jimmy Anderson-style head jerk to extra cover during my follow through. I didn't even hear the ball as the half-volley was smacked straight back at me and found a near-perfect receptacle flush in my right eye socket. A couple of years later I was fielding at short-leg to a left\u2011arm seamer with a weakness for bowling leg-stump, long hops. That time I didn't smell the leather so much as taste it as it scudded off the meat of the bat and shredded my bottom lip. It has left me with a Mick Jagger-esque pout and an unshakeable antipathy for left-arm medium\u2011pacers, but at least I had the consolation of saving three runs and was offered sympathy and a pint by a striking miner that night, who took some convincing that the mutilation wasn't the result of a truncheon blow on the picket line. Being hit while batting, though, remains the most conventional way to suffer injury in the game and those who withstood West Indies' attack, and Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson during the 70s and 80s, deserve most praise. Chief among them was India's happy hooker Mohinder Amarnath, recalled after a long exile in the Lancashire leagues with Lowerhouse and Crompton, who took them on with, initially, only a solar topee to protect himself. Richard Hadlee fractured his skull, Imran Khan knocked him unconscious, Malcolm Marshall dislodged his teeth, Thomson cracked his jaw and Michael Holding sent him to hospital to have stitches put in his head. Yet he still managed to score three centuries against Pakistan during the 1982-83 series and warmed up for his starring role in India's 1983 World Cup victory by hitting two more and four fifties in a brutal five-Test tour of the Caribbean. At Old Trafford in 1976 Brian Close and John Edrich, as the wonderful new film Fire in Babylon evocatively shows, were subjected to an 80-minute laceration on the Saturday evening by Holding, Andy Roberts and Wayne Daniel, and most batsmen of the era faced similar tribulations. No one, though, prospered through reckless courage and obduracy quite like Amarnath. In the age before helmets, however, not only the head was imperilled. On the 1974-75 Ashes tour David Lloyd received such a fearsome violation of his pink Litesome, the laughably flimsy abdominal protector, from Thomson that the object Richie Benaud demurely called his \"appendage\" ended up strangled by the holes. Despite that onslaught the only player who came close to a fatal blow on that tour was New Zealand's Ewen Chatfield from Peter Lever after England had retreated from their frontline ordeal across the Tasman Sea. The England physio Bernard Thomas saved his life by administering CPR after the tailender swallowed his tongue when felled by a bouncer. He recovered and three years later had the brass neck to \"Mankad\" Derek Randall, the bowler running the England batsman out at the non-striker's end without warning. It led to Ian Botham's unimprovable, if possibly apocryphal, quip: \"Remember, mate, you've already died once on the cricket field. Anything can happen.\" With a cricket ball as the missile, anything can happen, and that's what makes it such a compelling and potentially dangerous game. Some spectators wince when a batsman is hit; most others, such as those at Lord's in 2005 who yelped in delight when Steve Harmison's bouncer cut Ricky Ponting's face, enjoy it. But if, as Edward Bevan showed, you're not safe in a garden shed commentary box on top of Taunton's pavilion, those who do cheer may have to reap what they sow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
