Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, was greeted with thunderous applause by delegates as he arrived at a meeting of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), at which his country's deepening crisis tops the agenda. But the cheers could not hide the concerns of some leaders at the flood of Zimbabweans across their borders, mostly heading for South Africa, Zambia and Botswana to escape mass unemployment, hyperinflation and food shortages. Tomaz Salomao, the SADC's executive secretary, said several options were under consideration in dealing with Mr Mugabe, including adopting a \"hard line\", \"quiet diplomacy\" and a \"different\" method. But few diplomats expect much change in policy as long as other leaders are largely unwilling or unable to act. South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, was to report on his mediation between the Zimbabwean government and opposition, which appears to have made little progress. But Zimbabwe's justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, ridiculed the need for change or talks. \"Political reform is not necessary in my country because we are a democracy like any other democracy,\" he said. \"They [the opposition] are only interested in getting into power through unconstitutional means.\" Zambia's president, Levy Mwanawasa, who in March described Zimbabwe as a \"sinking Titanic\", pointedly praised Africa's liberation leaders, who include Mr Mugabe, and urged all Zimbabweans to \"maintain peace and stability\". Mike Mulongoti, Zambia's information minister, told the Associated Press: \"Zambia cannot impose its will on Zimbabwe, just as Zimbabwe cannot impose its will on Zambia. But we can quietly whisper to each other our concerns.\" But Sakwiba Sikota, a Zambian opposition MP, said: \"All this talk of 'We shouldn't interfere in neighbouring countries' ... is a concept that should be thrown out.\" The crisis in Zimbabwe can be seen in empty shop shelves and near-riots when goods are delivered. A boy of 15 and a security guard were crushed to death yesterday in a stampede to buy sugar in Bulawayo. But for now neither the internal crisis nor other countries are about to break Mr Mugabe's grip on power. Christopher Dell, the outgoing US ambassador, said in June that the ruling Zanu-PF was committing regime change on itself and Mr Mugabe would be out of office this year. But others see Mr Mugabe as still firmly in control, with a weak, divided opposition unable to challenge him, and about 4 million people - a third of Zimbabweans - leaving in search of work. That has acted as a safety valve for Mr Mugabe, relieving him of the pressure of those most likely to rebel and of many opposition voters. He has also retained the loyalty of the security forces chiefs, who do well through black market currency and trading. They can also buy dollars through the central bank at a fraction of the cost on the street."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
