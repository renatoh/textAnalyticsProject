The alarm was raised about noon today when helicopters were scrambled to Buachaille Etive Mor in Glencoe. Police confirmed at 3pm that casualties had been airlifted to hospital. It is believed the three climbers, part of a group of seven, succumbed to their injuries after being taken to the Belford Hospital in Fort William. A fourth climber, who managed to stagger off the mountain and call for help, was being treated for a shoulder injury. The drama unfolded as western Europe was battered by hurricane-force winds that killed 11 people, including four children, and cut a swath of destruction through France and Spain. Inspector Pamela Ross of Northern Constabulary, who was co-ordinating the mountain rescue, told Sky News: \"As a result of an avalanche on the mountain, three people have died. There were four people originally injured, three of whom have since died.\" Nine climbers were rescued in total. Ross added: \"We're making inquiries as to who the people are, where they are from, how they came to be walking in Glencoe today, and be in touch with next of kin to let them know what happened. We understand the three people who died were in a party of seven. There were a number of parties hill-walking today.\" First on the scene was a RAF rescue helicopter which had been diverted from an exercise in the area. A second helicopter was scrambled from the Royal Navy station at HMS Gannet near Prestwick. The Avalanche Information Service website warned that the hazard for Saturday would be \"considerable\". It stated: \"Snowpack stability will remain poor on all steep north-north-west through north to east aspects above 850m where avalanches are likely. Weak cornices will continue to grow over these locations and be prone to collapse.\" Buachaille Etive Mor's iconic pyramid shape features on many postcards of the area, making it a magnet for visitors from around the world. A local resident experienced in climbing the mountains around Glencoe said: \"It's the easiest way up the mountain. Most walkers will go up it and most climbers will come down it. However, the area is notorious for avalanches. We've had a massive amount of snow over the past five days with big winds. A man and his daughter were caught in one about five years ago in the same area and weren't found for three months because they were buried under 30ft of snow.\" On a day of extreme weather, high winds in northern Spain brought down the roof of a sports hall near Barcelona, killing four children. Seven people died in other incidents in Spain and south-western France as the fiercest storm in a decade blew in from the Atlantic. Traffic had to be halted in several French towns and thousands of people were stranded as airports and stations were closed as winds of up to 110mph hurled trees across tracks and runways. At least a million homes in France were thought to be without electricity tonight, with a \"red weather alert\" declared across much of the south and west. In Sant Boi de Llobregat, near Barcelona, a local government spokeswoman said: \"Part of the local sports hall collapsed, there were between 20 and 30 youngsters inside who were there for a baseball match.\" A policeman was killed by a falling tree as he directed traffic in Burela, Galicia, and a woman died when a wall collapsed, reportedly in Barcelona. Winds of 99mph were recorded at Biscarrosse, near the coast south of Bordeaux, where a motorist was killed when a tree was blown over. His passenger was seriously injured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
