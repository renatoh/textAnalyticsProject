Ducking stools don\u2019t actually work all that well. Children have nimble little fingers and fit easily up chimneys but they\u2019ve been more or less successfully rebranded: we generally try not to kill or maim them these days \u2013 unless they\u2019re foreign, of course. And we have given up inflicting our imperialist ambitions on unwitting nations. The days of waltzing into some country and saddling its mountains and lakes with the names of faceless bureaucrats \u2013 or surveyors from Crickhowell, in the case of George Everest \u2013 have gone. Now, it turns out, we waltz into countries and saddle them with the names of luxury watches. Or so it was recently announced. A team of British climbers had \u201cconquered\u201d a previously unclimbed peak in Kyrgyzstan in an \u201cexhilarating expedition\u201d. And they had named it after their sponsor. Welcome, world, to \u201cMount Trident\u201d \u2013 so-called \u201cafter British watch brand Christopher Ward\u2019s hero watch collection\u201d. The fact that there is already a Mount Trident \u2013 in Antarctica \u2013 and that the last notable naming of a mountain in Kyrgyzstan was Vladimir Putin Peak appears to be neither here nor there. And let us not even start on what a \u201chero watch collection\u201d may or may not be. It\u2019s not even the first mountain that the company has slapped its corporate logo on. The same team went to Tajikistan in 2013 and achieved a first ascent of what is now \u201cMount Christopher Ward\u201d. But maybe the surprising thing is not that there is nothing in the world left that a company won\u2019t try and commercialise, it\u2019s that others haven\u2019t yet jumped on the same bandwagon. Kyrgyzstan alone has dozens of unclimbed peaks all just sitting there waiting for their corporate branding. Where is Mount Sports Direct? Peak Primark? When oh when will we have Mount Poundworld? Good luck to the climbers. A nice bunch of intrepid young men, by all accounts, who just want to climb mountains. But at what cost? These are some of the most remote and beautiful places left on Earth. A true wilderness where few people have ever been, named now and for ever more as an advert for a \u00a3730 watch. It\u2019s one things to name your mountains after surveyors and strongman presidents, but to turn them into commercials for overpriced consumer goods is surely in another category. Mountains have always reflected our own world back at us: our imperial ambitions, our national pride, our xenophobic tendencies. The \u201cconquering\u201d of Everest by a British expedition is widely seen as the crowning moment of the age of empire: the news reached England on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation. But now it\u2019s just money. Our mountains are us: venal, commercial, exploited for profit. The natural world is there for the picking, to be commercialised and commodified and then sold back to us. Adventures have to be Instagramable, experiences must look good on Facebook. Wilderness is there to be \u201cconquered\u201d. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m just upset because Theresa May has taken my favourite pastime \u2013 walking up hills \u2013 and turned it Tory. It was bad enough when Boris and Cameron made a Conservative landgrab for cycling. But you can go outdoors without a pair of telescopic walking poles, a sensible polo shirt and a desire to exit the European Union, you really can. Let Mount Trident inspire you to not buy a \u00a3730 watch. To not buy anything \u2013 even telescopic walking poles. It\u2019s perfectly possible to go for a hike without dressing like a German lady trucker \u2013 though I generally do \u2013 but it\u2019s a wonderful world out there, whatever. Now say sorry like you mean it, Ryan And so, congratulations, Ryan Lochte for this year\u2019s masterclass in How to Apologise Like a Dick. Hot on the heels of Donald Trump\u2019s announcement last week of an unprecedented, heartfelt and entirely non-specific \u201cregret\u201d comes the American gold medal-winning swimmer\u2019s incursion into the burgeoning field of the celebrity non-apology. Previous practitioners of the genre include Gary Barlow, who prefaced news of a new Take That album with an apology to \u201canyone who was offended by the tax stories earlier this year\u201d. Because, yes, it was the stories that offended one so, not the \u00a320m band members paid back to HMRC this year. And now: \u201cThe Lochte\u201d, aka an apology so unapologetic that it slips in an entirely new accusation, in this case against the host city of the games at which you\u2019ve just won gold. The 12-time Olympic medallist had earlier told the world he\u2019d been robbed at gunpoint, a story that had the unfortunate qualities of being a) untrue and b) a cover story for the fact that he was pissed. For which Lochte apologised. Or, more specifically, he apologised for \u201cnot being more careful and candid in how I described the events\u201d. And also for the \u201ctraumatic\u201d experience of having \u201ca stranger point a gun and demand money\u201d. Or as an eyewitness, Fernando Deluz, told the New York Times, when a security guard stopped him after he tried to escape. No word as yet from his sponsors \u2013 Speedo, Airweave and Ralph Lauren. A word of advice, Ryan: you may want to hold off on the use of the word \u201ctraumatic\u201d just a little while longer. The Olympics are just for youngsters? I don\u2019t think so Thank you, Olympic showjumper Nick Skelton for giving hope to middle-aged wearers of Lycra everywhere. It\u2019s still possible, people! Skelton\u2019s blond hair may be turning a touch silvery, and in 2011, he had a hip-replacement operation, but last week he showed us what\u2019s possible when, at the age of 58, he became Britain\u2019s oldest gold medal winner since 61-year-old Joshua Milner triumphed at shooting in 1908. Because, yes, you too can dare to dream. Consider Oscar Swahn, a Swede, who competed up to the age of 72 complete with tweed jacket and a Father Christmas beard. And then there\u2019s Santiago Lange, a 54-year-old Argentinian who won a gold in the sailing this year - minus part of his left lung, removed after treatment for cancer. All you need is grit, determination, a big horse and perhaps 40 years of experience: Skelton entered his first competition in 1975.
