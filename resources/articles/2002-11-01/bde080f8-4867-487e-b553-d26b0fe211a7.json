He refused to be drawn on whether legislation on a referendum on the single currency would be specifically mentioned but said the \"euro will be there\". Asked whether the government would feature the euro in the speech, Mr Cook said: \"You would not expect me to talk about what is in it, that is capital treason. \"Sure, the euro will be there and I think you will be interested in it, but you will have to wait and see.\" Asked if a referendum in the next parliament would have to be stated in the Queen's speech, Mr Cook said: \"We are quite clear about the convention in which we operate here, which is that anything we put in the Queen's speech, we have to seek to implement in the subsequent session. \"But we do not exclude from doing other things. The fact that something is not specifically mentioned in the Queen's speech doesn't mean that we cannot then subsequently introduce it.\" Mr Cook said the final draft of the Queen's speech had been written today \"because that is the time that it takes to inscribe the goatskin\". Pressed on whether there would be \"paving legislation\" in the speech, he told women journalists at a lunch in Westminster: \"I have to be very very clear that I am not saying anything about the Queen's speech, and I am not saying that the paving legislation is not there, nor am I saying it is there. \"Thank you very much, but it is a secret between me and the goat.\" Tony Blair and his ministers have remained tight-lipped about the timetable for the single currency, sticking only to the mantra that the government will recommend the UK enter the euro if and when the five economic tests have been met. Mr Cook himself acknowledged the sensitivity of the issue when he said that if he were to \"move a comma\" on the euro then it would be interpreted by the media as a \"gaffe\". Downing Street played down the significance of Mr Cook's remarks that the Queen's speech would contain \"interesting\" details on the euro. Mr Blair's official spokesman said: \"I would hope you would be very interested in every aspect of the Queen's speech. \"My strong advice is not to get too excited. I don't think that anybody would think that we are in a different place after the Queen's speech than before on the euro.\" Whether paving legislation would be in the speech was \"a hypothetical question\" and \"it is not a hypothetical question that I recognise\". He added: \"Robin Cook has said what Robin Cook has said.\" Referring to remarks made in May by the then transport secretary, Stephen Byers, again to women journalists, that the Queen's speech would include legislation on the euro, the spokesman said: \"I think we have been down this road before. \"The policy is precisely the same the last time the euro was mentioned at a women's lobby lunch as it is now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
