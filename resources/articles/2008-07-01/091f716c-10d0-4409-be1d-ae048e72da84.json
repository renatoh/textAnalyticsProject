It's two hours of interviews with former Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, commander of US military police in Iraq, and various male and female soldiers (none above the rank of sergeant) working at the jail, interspersed with the infamous photographs and some dubious, arty re-enactments involving actors. It makes its points firmly enough but has neither the breadth nor depth of Alex Gibney's Oscar-winning Taxi to the Dark Side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
