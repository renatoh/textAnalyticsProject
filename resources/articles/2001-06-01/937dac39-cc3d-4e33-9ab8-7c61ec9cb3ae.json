Members of the mutual life insurer voted overwhelmingly in favour of demutualisation at its annual general meeting last week. It is anticipated the float will take place on July 9 and is expected to raise around \u00a31.4billion pounds for the insurer. This will also mean the insurer will have a slot in the FTSE100 index of blue-chip companies. Most members are looking at average windfalls of between \u00a3450 and \u00a3540 each, while some policyholders could be looking at an average \u00a32,000 payout. Higher payouts are determined by the age of the investor as well as how long they have held their policy. Some City bookmakers are predicting that shares will close at more than 285p, meaning even those who buy at the higher price could make a profit. Further windfalls could be on the way this summer, as members of Edinburgh based insurer Scottish Provident will be asked to vote for or against its sale to Abbey National this Thursday. Typical payouts are expected to be around \u00a34,500 but could be up to as much as \u00a3100,000 in some cases. But around 350,000 Scottish Provident policyholders will get nothing. They have no membership rights, although it is doubtful if this was ever pointed out to them by the independent financial advisers (IFAs) who sell all Scottish Provident plans. The great majority of these - some 300,000 - have bought protection policies such as life, income replacement, critical illness and medical cover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
