The knitting community \u2013 traditionally viewed as a wholesome, screen-free, apolitical hobby \u2013 is entangled in a broader debate about racism and social justice. Ravelry, a prominent online knitting and crocheting platform,banned pro-Trump messaging on its site on Sunday, following a controversy over one user\u2019s craft projects sporting pro-Trump rhetoric including \u201cbuild the wall\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. But the change on Ravelry is just the latest development in an ongoing conversation about diversity in the knitting community, which came to a head this year with the hashtag #WeKnitToo. Following a culturally insensitive post by one knitting devotee, some people of color created a campaign to showcase their work and increase visibility. Tian Connaughton, a black crochet and knitwear designer who has been on Ravelry since February 2008, said the lack of diversity in the crafting community has long been an issue and is only recently being made more public through these campaigns. Fellow non-white knitters shared stories of facing racism in yarn stores and at fiber festivals and events. \u201cThere were stories being shared of the hateful patterns and comments in groups we\u2019re subjected to when all we want to do is take part in and enjoy our knitting and crocheting, the same as white crafters,\u201d Connaughton said. Jamie, a user who asked her last name be withheld to avoid further abuse from people on the site, said she was one of the users who pushed Ravelry to address the problem. \u201cHistorically, knitting, like any art, has always been political,\u201d she said. \u201cThese problems are not new, but I cannot deny that this presidency and the era we are in now has emboldened people to share hateful views.\u201d Leesa Renee Hall, a writer whose work centers on unpacking unconscious biases, said she has followed the ongoing discussion in the knitting world in recent months, which she called a \u201cracial awakening\u201d not limited to the Ravelry platform. Major companies such as Reddit, YouTube and Facebook have been struggling to police outright racist and racially biased language on platforms in recent years. \u201cThe problem with this kind of response is that the issue will undoubtedly pop up again,\u201d she said. \u201cIn its attempt to do the right thing, Ravelry is going to create more chaos. In their attempt to jump into action immediately, they don\u2019t work on the underlying biases at hand.\u201d Some knitters opposed to Sunday\u2019s ban have started the hashtag \u201c#MakeKnittingFunAgain\u201d in response to what they see as an overpoliticization of the fibers space. Andy, a Mexican and Venezuelan member of the knitting community, who asked to be identified by first name only due to fear of backlash from the community, said that the change is a welcome one but only a small step in the larger battle of addressing hate speech online. \u201cThe phrase \u2018I just want to go back to knitting\u2019 is very common, but a lot of us don\u2019t have the luxury of separating what some people call politics from their identity,\u201d Andy said. \u201cA lot of us would like to just enjoy our hobbies without thinking about these things, but that isn\u2019t the world we live in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
