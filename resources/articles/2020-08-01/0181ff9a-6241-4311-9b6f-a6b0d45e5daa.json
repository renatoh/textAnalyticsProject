The report, An Unequal Crisis, found that one in four disabled people who are in work are currently facing redundancy. This rose to 37% of those who said their disability had a large impact on their day-to-day life. The study of 6,000 workers by Citizens Advice also found that half of those shielding because of extreme vulnerability to the coronavirus were at risk of redundancy. Two in five parents or carers also face losing their jobs. \u201cAlthough the new research shows the risk of redundancy is widespread, with one in six (17%) of the working-age population facing redundancy, it indicated that those in more vulnerable circumstances are likely to bear the brunt,\u201d said Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. Demand for help from Citizens Advice on redundancy selection has increased almost sevenfold since February. The charity\u2019s frontline advisers are currently dealing with a redundancy issue every two minutes. \u201cEmployers face difficult choices but there are worrying signs that disabled workers, people who shielded, parents and carers are being pushed to the front of the queue when it comes to redundancy,\u201d said Guy. \u201cAs tough as these times are, they cannot be used as an excuse to break the rules,\u201d she added. \u201cIf someone is facing an unfair redundancy, the odds of getting redress under the current system are stacked against them. Workers need a watchdog that will be a one-stop shop to protect their employment rights.\u201d The charity also warned it was seeing troubling signs that workers\u2019 rights were being ignored during the redundancy process. \u201cA large wave of redundancies is coming,\u201d said Guy. \u201cBut while workers have the right to a fair redundancy process, we are seeing troubling evidence that this is being ignored.\u201d The charity, which said the findings could be the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d, is retraining advisers on workers\u2019 rights in preparation for a wave of redundancies. Last week the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned that closing the government furlough scheme could push unemployment to 10% this year. Before the pandemic, retail worker Natalie had always been given shifts around her childcare. She was told she would be made redundant after returning from furlough because she was unable to work more flexible hours. She told her employer this was unfair and was then asked to take a test along with other employees, after which she was made redundant. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried that I could lose my house as I don\u2019t know how long it will be until I find another job. I\u2019ve always worked and never been unemployed. This is quite a scary scenario. The thought of losing my home scares me. It would destroy me.\u201d Jamie McGlynn, a contact centre anager at Citizens Advice Manchester, said: \u201cPeople are absolutely racked with worry. One lady with underlying health conditions told her employer she felt unsafe about returning to work as another worker had Covid symptoms but wasn\u2019t isolating. The next week she had her redundancy notice through.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cRedundancies which are based on unlawful discrimination are completely unacceptable. Legislation is in place to ensure processes are fair and reasonable, as well as being informed by appropriate equalities considerations. \u201cWe urge employers to avoid cutting jobs where they can during this difficult period and to continue to access the job retention scheme where possible. \u201cEmployees who believe their redundancy was unfair may be able to complain to an employment tribunal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
