When did get a sniff, he tossed the ball straight into touch. Sean Lamont wing \u2013 4 Bumped off Hartley as though he was made of gutta-percha, but for all his strength he showed all the penetration of a blunt butter knife. Nick De Luca centre \u2013 6 Brought in for his tackling, added considerable incisiveness and power to the Scotland midfield in attack. Robinson finally got his midfield selection right. Graeme Morrison centre \u20137 Made a glorious dump tackle on Monye, and showed a lot more crash, bang and wallop going forward than he had in previous championship outings. Max Evans wing \u2013 6 Saw a lot of the ball, but never made more than a half-break. So small and slight that he spent a lot of time being tossed around like a rag doll. Dan Parks scrum-half \u2013 5 Made two of the most embarrassingly wayward drop-goal attempts you'll ever see. The control shown against Wales a distant memory. Chris Cusiter (capt) fly-half \u2013 6 Bossed, cajoled and harried his team as a captain, standing up to Borthwick. Snappy around the fringes and quick in delivery, he outshone Care. Allan Jacobsen prop \u2013 4 Quick hands to put De Luca through a gap, but had a torrid time at the scrum, consistently failing properly to bind, which led to a series of collapses. Ross Ford hooker \u2013 5 Seemed to get mixed up with some of the calls at the lineout, but had a fair afternoon despite that. Got up Hartley's nose. Not that that's too hard to do. Euan Murray prop \u2013 4 Should be cornerstone for the entire Scotland scrum, but he seems a little way off his best. As it was, he kept parity with the men opposite him, but no more. Jim Hamilton lock \u2013 4 Gave away a moronic penalty at the start of the second half, gifting England three points. A big man, but fails to make enough of an impression in the loose. Alastair Kellock lock \u2013 5 Steady in the lineout, which has been the best in the championship, but spent too much time hidden in the mess of bodies around the breakdown. Kelly Brown flanker \u2013 7 Made an absolute nuisance of himself all match long, wrecking England's possession and scything down their runners at close quarters. John Barclay Flanker \u2013 6 England must have been tipped off by his barnstorming brilliance in the past three matches. They kept a tight rein on him, so not as dominant as he can be. Johnnie Beattie No8 \u2013 8 England kept Barclay quiet, but that only made more room for Beattie. Put his head down to thump his way down the centre time and again. Man of the match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
