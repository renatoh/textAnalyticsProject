He is expected to announce plans for a 'hard' cooling-off period for credit and store cards, meaning applicants would have to wait seven to 10 days before they could use their credit. This could spell the end for store cards, which often attract new customers by offering discounts and instant credit as they shop. The policies are also likely to include compulsory financial education for 11- to 18-year-olds, with lessons on personal finance introduced to the national curriculum, and a more prominent and simpler explanation of annual percentage rate in adverts and monthly statements. Osborne, who will be speaking at the Conservatives' 'Debt Summit', has been highly critical of the government's failure to tackle the UK's growing debt problems. When personal insolvency figures hit a new high two weeks ago, he said: 'There is a personal tragedy behind each of these insolvencies and this shows that many families are feeling the pressure of rising interest rates and fuel bills.' His interest in debt took on a personal note when his mother was forced to close her Kensington delicatessen last summer after incurring huge losses. According to official records, \u00a3372,000 of Osborne family money was invested in the venture, but only \u00a38,000 was left by the time it closed, with a \u00a357,000 loan still outstanding last year. Osborne added that banks needed to be more disciplined and responsible in the way they lent money. 'The government can't just step back and pretend this is nothing to do with it ... An economy built on borrowed money is built on borrowed time.' The Finance &amp; Leasing Association, a trade body for the consumer credit industry, said it regarded the idea of a cooling-off period as 'regulatory overkill'. Spokeswoman Helen Saxon said: 'The government has just spent several years looking at the consumer credit industry and didn't think this move necessary. If someone is determined to use a credit or store card irresponsibly, doing it 10 days later isn't going to make much difference.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
