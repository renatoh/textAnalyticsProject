Mr Reid has proposed splitting up the Home Office so that a ministry of interior takes charge of police, immigration, MI6, community cohesion and anti-terrorism activities. Some of the security functions now with the Cabinet Office, and not subject to direct political accountability, would also go to the interior ministry, or a department of national security A ministry of justice would take charge of administration of the courts, probation service, prisons and penal policy. A preliminary discussion was slated at one point for the cabinet today, but there was no confirmation of this last night. The idea has met resistance from civil servants, especially senior security figures in the Cabinet Office. It may not match plans being drawn up by Gordon Brown but some ministers believe the resistance is coming from civil servants, and not from senior Labour politicians. It is being argued that MI6 should remain under the political purview of the Foreign Office since the foreign secretary is best placed to sanction security operations in the knowledge of the potential diplomatic damage if the operation goes wrong or is exposed. Some observers had interpreted Mr Reid's demand for an integrated government response to the terrorist threat as a call to merge MI5 and MI6. It is also likely the review will reject the Tory-backed proposal for telephone taps to be admissible as evidence in court. The proposal has been supported by the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith. Mr Reid has said he will not support extending the 28 days maximum detention without charge, unless a detailed case is presented by the police or intelligence services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
