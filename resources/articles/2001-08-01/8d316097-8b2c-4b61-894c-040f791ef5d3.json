Five years later on the same stage, Jay Kaye is having his own pop moment. Strapped into a mirrored native American headdress, Jamiroquai's funk emir addresses his public at his first major show in two years. \"We played a secret gig to 100 people the other night and I thought I'd lost the plot, but seeing you, I know I haven't,\" he says, and a field full of airhorns beeps tumultuously back. Kaye is realising the ambition encoded in every teenage pop wannabe's DNA: facing an adoring crowd so big that it extends to the horizon. At a guess, that disappointing secret gig was probably full of industry bods who deem Kaye to be as uncool as they did when he emerged in 1992 with his notions of dance music that incorporated new agey mysticism and the melodic values of 1970s funk. Not to worry, because the audience at what is officially titled Knebworth 01 is far more welcoming - and it's not even there just for him. Jamiroquai are just one of 160 acts at this Ministry of Sound-sponsored festival, which aims to bring Ibiza to Hertfordshire, by way of uniquely Brit touches such as Pot Noodle stalls. But despite competition from the cream of UK dance culture (no, I haven't heard of most of them either), when Kaye arrives, working it like Miss America down a flight of steps as fireworks go off, Knebworth drops what it's doing and rushes to the main stage. Any assumption that it is because he offers a respite from Cockney gonks fumbling with record decks is quashed by evidence that Kaye has more elan in his unfashionable toenails than 159 hipper acts have in their entire bodies. He glissades through Cosmic Girl and Space Cowboy, strutting and preening as if groomed since birth for the role of blue-eyed soul kid. The new single, Little L, and Love Foolosophy, inspired by former girlfriend Denise Van Outen (\"I'm single and available,\" he hoots), sound familiar already by virtue of keyboard squelches and blips, and shivery house-inspired strings. A caffeinated run-through of Donna Summer's Bad Girls - unfortunately not on the new album, A Funk Odyssey - induces more airhorn frenzy. In this context, familiarity, complemented by that eternally sleek voice and a damn-fool hat, breeds content. Knebworth House"}, "isHosted": false}}}
