Word had spread that the Olympic torch was coming this way sometime soon, only no one knew exactly when. Its progress had been delayed on both of the previous two days, by one lot of protesters in Niter\u00f3i on the other side of Guanabara Bay, and then another soon after it had arrived in the city itself. The organisers had been rearranging the route at the last minute to steer clear of any more trouble. So for two hours the spectators had been milling around, making small talk. Every so often a police motorcyclist came shooting down the street, siren wailing, and everyone rushed into the road. But these were false alarms and the crowd dropped back again as soon as it was clear that nothing else was coming. A true story: the last time and only other time I was in Rio I met a man who had never seen the sea. He was in his 20s and had lived all his life in Brazil\u2019s interior. This was his first time in the city. So we made the short walk to the shore. I was unsure whether he would be overcome with awe. When we arrived he wrinkled his nose and said simply: \u201cIt stinks!\u201d These Cariocas had not been waiting for the Olympic torch quite so long but the atmosphere here carried a similar sort of uncertainty to the one I felt then, watching my new friend, wondering how he was going to react to what he saw. At half past midnight another police motorcycle arrived. Behind it came a convoy of police cars travelling two abreast and way beyond them more bright flashing red lights. These last were not police cars but two Coca-Cola floats, carrying dancers who spun and twirled to the funk pumping from the speakers. Behind them there was a lorry carrying a large TV screen, showing an advert for a new Nissan. The organisers had contrived to insert a commercial break into a live parade. Then came another float, this one branded by Bradesco, one of the country\u2019s largest banking companies. And at last the torch itself, the flame only just visible above the helmets and shields of the dozen riot police surrounding it. On social media the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been inviting people to retweet a picture of a dove. \u201cJoin us,\u201d it says, \u201cand share a dove to celebrate peace.\u201d Here in Copacabana the Olympics arrived accompanied by lorry-loads of men carrying automatic weapons. As the convoy passed there was a bang close by. A plastic bottle full of water hurled from a tower block had shattered with a great splat. As those closest looked up, a middle-aged woman ran out from the crowd into the road. Five security officers in brown shirts knocked her down, then carried her to a police car. Her friends ran with them, protesting as she was handcuffed and bundled into the back. They were still shouting as the car disappeared at high speed down a side street. When the IOC picked Rio for these Olympics, the then president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, cried with joy. \u201cToday I have felt prouder of being a Brazilian than on any other day,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is the day to celebrate because Brazil has left behind the level of second-class countries and entered the ranks of first-class countries. Today we earned respect.\u201d Lula left office in 2011. But these Olympics were supposed to be one of the crowning achievements of a presidency that had lifted 36 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty and led the country to become, in 2011, the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. \u201cAll those people who thought we had no ability to govern this country,\u201d Lula said, \u201cwill now know we can host the Olympics.\u201d Rio was chosen as the host city in October 2009, at the IOC congress in Copenhagen. The day of the decision was a public holiday and they say around 50,000 people gathered on the beach here to watch the announcement live on big TV screens. Seven years later the mood is very different. Lula was then midway through the second term of a presidency that had begun in 2002 when he was elected with 52.7 million votes, one of the largest mandates in the history of democratic politics. Right now Brazil is in the depths of its worst recession in at least a generation and Lula has just been ordered to stand trial on charges of obstructing justice during the investigation into the corruption at Petrobras, the state-owned oil company. Neither he nor his successor, Dilma Rousseff, who is facing an impeachment trial, was due to be in the VIP box at the opening ceremony, because neither could be sure they would be welcome. Even without them, the interim president, Michel Temer, said he was fully expecting to be booed by the crowd in the Maracan\u00e3 stadium. The Maracan\u00e3 itself, one of the world\u2019s great arenas, has become emblematic of what has gone wrong. In 1999 it had a capacity of at least 175,000, and often held more still when the fans were jammed standing in the open seating on the top tier for one of the city\u2019s Fla-Flu (Flamengo v Fluminense) football derbies. These days, after changes made for the World Cup and Olympics, that has been cut to 75,000. That same top tier has been largely given over to VIP boxes, which are due to be sold to private business after the Olympics. Among the people on the street there is a strong sense that these Games, like the new subway line that is restricted to Olympic ticket-holders, is not for them but for the tourists, the VIPs and the people watching back home on TV. The next morning the torch was gone but there was now another procession nearby. Thousands of anti-government protesters had gathered outside the famous Copacabana Palace Hotel. They were carrying homemade flags and banners and some were beating drums and shouting into megaphones. It was an anti-government protest \u2013 Fora Temer! (Temer Out!) \u2013 but there were anti-Olympic sentiments mixed in with it. At the front of the parade two men carried a large banner with the hashtag #CalamidadeOlimpica. Lula always intended the Games to be a political statement and that is what they have become. The anger people here feel towards their government has been inextricably bound to the broader, worldwide movement against the Olympics themselves. In recent years Boston, Hamburg, Davos, Munich, Krakow, Oslo and Stockholm have all pulled out of planned bids for the winter or summer Games because of a lack of popular support. The reasons were always broadly the same. The Games cost too much money \u2013 money that could be better spent elsewhere. People are tired of the multibillion-dollar budget overruns and broken promises about the lasting economic benefits of being the host city. Add to that the damage done to the credibility of many of the Olympic sports by doping scandals and maladministration. So far in Rio only three sports have sold out: tennis, triathlon and marathon swimming. Anyone who wants tickets to what they call the greatest show on earth can still get them. The Fora Temer! protesters had chosen their spot well. The Copacabana Palace is one of the city\u2019s most expensive hotels, so is home to many of those same visiting VIPs who would occupy prime seats at the stadium. On the first floor balcony a line of IOC officials were looking down on the scene below. To one side there was the new beach volleyball arena, backdropped by Sugar Loaf mountain, and to the other the broad expanse of Copacabana, teeming with people \u2013 just as they must have imagined it when they awarded Rio the Games. And just in front, the organisers have erected a huge statue of the Olympic rings over the road, lost from view, at this particular moment, among the thousands of furious protesters. On the balcony, the IOC family looked on, as unsure as the rest of us about how this next fortnight is going to play out. These are uncertain times for the city, and the Games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
