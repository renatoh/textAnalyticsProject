The Arsenal manager is upset that Jack Wilshere looks set to be named in Pearce's 23-man squad for the finals in Denmark, which take place between 11 and 25 June, despite his having graduated to Capello's senior team. Wilshere, who has made 54 appearances for club and country at all levels this season, is expected to play for Capello's side in the Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland on 4 June. Wenger has warned of the dangers of burnout but his ire would deepen if Liverpool succeeded in withdrawing Carroll from the squad, on the basis that the knee problem that has held him back in recent weeks would benefit from a summer of rest. Carroll, the \u00a335m January signing from Newcastle United, who is also a full international, has made 31 appearances this season. Liverpool are lobbying for Carroll to be excused from the tournament in Denmark and, amid the toing and froing, the Football Association was forced to say Pearce's final squad announcement would not be until next Monday, after the final round of Premier League fixtures. The governing body had hoped to publish the list of names on Thursday. \"Pearce will be concerned to leave Carroll behind,\" Wenger said, \"and I don't think he will do it because that is opening the doors for any other complaints behind that. Players react like: 'If he doesn't go, why do I go?' That could be a dangerous game to leave Carroll behind. It could create many other problems. I would not be the first on the phone but there would be no logic in the attitude of the selection. \"I could understand if Carroll doesn't go for injury problems but for fatigue problems ... it would be more difficult to convince people in England that he is more tired than Jack Wilshere.\" Wenger announced on Thursday morning that he knew that Wilshere was in Pearce's squad and, although he continues to hope that there could be a change of heart, prompted by his pressure, he intends to plan for the beginning of next season without the 19-year-old. In an attempt to guard against burnout, he will give Wilshere four weeks of complete rest, calculated from the day that the Under-21s exit the Championship, and he said the midfielder would then need at least three weeks of pre-season work before he could consider selecting him. The semi-finals in Denmark are scheduled for 22 June; the final for 25 June and the new Premier League season will kick-off on 13 August. Wenger said the senior England team \"know Jack will not be available for the friendly\" on 10 August against Holland at Wembley. \"Jack will be very unlikely to start the season for us,\" said Wenger, who feels that the decision to take Wilshere to Denmark is a \"risk for Jack's health\". Wenger, meanwhile, has told Cesc F\u00e1bregas that Arsenal's trophy-free season does not offer him the excuse to leave for Barcelona, the midfielder's former club and perennial suitors. \"What guarantees you that if you go somewhere else, you win trophies?\" Wenger said. \"I believe that the biggest pride for a captain is to be committed to his club and deliver trophies with his team. \"A player who changes clubs every time when he is frustrated or when he does not win a trophy goes nowhere. I believe that the quality of a sports life is to be committed to your club and not just move out when it doesn't go as well as expected. \"I expect Cesc to be here. We will fight very hard to keep him here. You have always to fight when you have a player of that quality. You have always to fight to keep the players, of course.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
