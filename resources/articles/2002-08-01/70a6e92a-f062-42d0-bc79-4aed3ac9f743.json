Frighteningly few of these magnificent creatures remain, and getting anywhere near one requires the gods to look upon the seeker with unimaginable favour. Or so I thought. By the time I'd finished my expedition into some of the most far-flung reaches of India, I'd been closely eyeballed, in no uncertain terms, by that most venerated predator. Arriving at the airport of Raipur - capital of the new state of Chhattisgarh in central India - my tiger safari began with a drive deep into the heart of one of country's remotest regions. After a hot, dusty and bumpy journey, pleasingly offset by a drink-filled cool box and raucous Bollywood classics blaring from the tinny stereo, I arrived in the capital of an ancient principality, Kwardhar. Bed and board for the night was at the local maharaja's palace - a museum-like place of authentic, though faded, grandeur. The maharaja and maharani still reside here, join all guests for dinner, and are incredibly hospitable. \"There used to be so many wild animals in the vicinity,\" the seventy-something maharani told me. \"Tigers, leopards, wild hogs. We would go on regular hunting parties.\" After dinner, we headed for the great durbar, or court, where trophies of various kills adorn the walls. My first tiger sighting was here: a large, very dead, stuffed beast - \"Uncle shot it,\" I was informed. The maharaja retrieved a photo album from a dusty corner of the room. \"We killed only the ageing trophy animals.\" Pictures of a youthful, beautiful maharani armed with a rifle, standing on the body of dead leopard, stared out. That night, to get myself in the mood for intrepid tiger searching, I read The Man-eaters of Kumaon, tales of ferocious tigers hunting down humans in rural India by the legendary Anglo-Indian tiger hunter Jim Corbett. I felt grateful to wake up intact, and began my three-hour bone-jarring drive to Kanha National Park. Bumping my way along the remote, twisting rural roads, I peered into the thick foliage for signs of tigers. Nothing appeared except for the odd, emaciated squirrel. These days, tigers exist largely in a number of national parks, all under the safeguard of Project Tiger, established by Indira Gandhi back in the 1970s to increase the dwindling population. Partially successful, the number of tigers in India has stabilised at around 4,000. Kanha Park is part of Project Tiger and is enclosed by gates and high fences. Security is tight and it is forbidden to take so much as a leaf out of the area. Accommodation inside Kanha is provided by a number of safari lodges - I stayed at the Royal Tiger Resort. Each lodge is attended by its own fleet of Gypsies - a tiny Indian version of a Jeep - to whisk you around. After a quick shower and glass of spicy garam chai (milky, sweet tea), I jumped into a Gypsy with the lodge's owner, Raj, and a holidaying BT engineer from Enfield who quickly informed me that I had \"no chance of seeing a tiger this evening\". We drove deep into the park, stopping to view antelopes and monkeys along the way. The ancient forests and grass-filled plains shimmered in the gentle breeze, creating a dreamy calmness. As we drove, Raj explained the various hooting alarm calls of the resident chittals (spotted deer) and langurs (long-limbed monkeys). These alarm calls provide an excellent device by which to track a tiger as it moves around the bush. While we were sitting in our Gypsy by a small lake, watching a large male sambar (antelope), a langur's alarm call rang out across the quiet evening. We headed off in pursuit. Turning the engine off, we rolled gently down a dusty incline. \"I think it's in there,\" Raj whispered, the dense foliage rustling at some indeterminable spot among the trees. The Gypsy came to a stop and we sat still for 10 minutes. Suddenly, a beast appeared... a small jackal about five metres behind us. It stood, looked at us disdainfully, sniffed the air and then trotted off. We went in search of the warden's office. The tiny, ramshackle warden's hut was set beside a ring of trees and, with the sun setting, Raj hopped out of the Gypsy and reappeared with the warden. \"A female tiger often brings her cubs to play under these trees,\" the warden said. I asked if he'd had any close calls lately. \"The other day a friend and I were walking in the forest when we came face to face with a large, angry tigress. You should never run from a tiger. So we stood our ground, waved our arms and made as much noise as possible. She ran off. At that moment, I felt like weeping.\" All vehicles must be out of the park by sunset and so, after scanning the tigerless horizon for 20 minutes, we started for home. As we turned a corner deep in the forest, a flash of colour crossed in front of us. \"There! There!\" shouted Raj. About 50 metres in front of us a large tigress had leapt from one side of the road to the other and was now standing languidly by the roadside peering back at us, tongue lolling. Raj rolled the open Gypsy to within five metres of the animal, which stood its ground, staring at us as if we were the most insignificant creatures she'd ever seen. Fear coursed through me as we nudged closer. Suddenly, the tigress sprang back into the forest. Raj released the handbrake and we slowly slid down the gradient, parallel to her. We reached a clearing and watched transfixed as she leapt nonchalantly over a small stream. Without a care in the world, she walked into the middle of our track. The Gypsy was almost on top of her when she gave one final look back, and bounded into the dark forest. The next morning, I jumped into a taxi for the journey to another park within Project Tiger - Bandhavgarh, a four-hour drive north of Kanha, which is reputedly the most tiger-rich area in the world. Facilities are a bit more basic here, due mainly to its remote location on the north-eastern fringes of the state of Madhya Pradesh. There are few of the open spaces of Kanha; rather, the thick jungle of Bandhavgarh has a claustrophobic, sticky feel. It also contains a warren of abandoned, primeval monks' caves and a 1,000-year-old statue of a reclining Hindu god, Vishnu. Owner of the Nature Heritage Lodge Raj Sharma and resident naturalist Deepak are tiger experts and know the park intimately. Their knowledge became evident 15 minutes into our drive through the park, where we thankfully broke away from a flotilla of tourist-filled Gypsies. We immediately picked up the pugmarks of a tiger pressed into the middle of one of the dusty tracks. Deepak recognised the mark - as individual as a fingerprint - as that of \"a large female who's just had cubs; she's very close.\" Raj pulled up beside a dense thicket; Deepak hissed and pointed and there, deep in the bush, the tigress walked stealthily away. Just behind trotted one of her cubs and, before we knew it, they'd been absorbed back into the forest. We circled around in the Gypsy, in the hope of another sighting, following langur alarm calls and visiting waterholes, but the tigress had vanished. Finally, we met up with another Gypsy. Raj and Deepak were deep in conversation with the driver when suddenly, the by-now familiar alarm call rang through the air. The other Gypsy moved off and, after a brief lull, another loud \"hoot\" rang out. The driver of the second Gypsy then began hissing frantically, beckoning us over. Raj slowly guided our vehicle to the spot and there, about 10 metres into the forest, sat a large male. He was washing his face with his paw. Then he looked up and spotted us. Gracefully, he got to his feet, stretched his body, yawned and walked straight towards our car. The tiger's mouth was hanging open and he was growling. With razor sharp claws, huge paws and muscles rippling, he was absolutely terrifying. He got to within two metres of the Gypsy, stopped for a brief second and then dismissively turned his back on us and sauntered along the track before vanishing into the forest. Around the after-dinner campfire, Raj and Deepak stressed that nobody has ever been harmed in such encounters. \"The vehicle confuses them; they think it's an animal,\" Deepak said. In the following days, I often fell sleep in my cabin feeling reassured, only to be awoken in the dead of night, wide-eyed and scared. I would switch on the light and look outside the door to make sure I was alone. After sitting for a calming few minutes, I would realise that no danger was present and fall into a deep, tiger-free sleep.
