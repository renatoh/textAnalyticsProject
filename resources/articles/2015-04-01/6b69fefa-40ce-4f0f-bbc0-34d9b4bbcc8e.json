The US president added: \u201cThere is no formula, there is no option, to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon that will be more effective than the diplomatic initiative and framework that we put forward \u2013 and that\u2019s demonstrable.\u201d Two days after the announcement of the deal between Iran and the major world powers \u2013 achieved in Switzerland after 18 months of talks and which must be finalised by the end of June \u2013 Obama spoke to the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman at the White House for an interview that was published online on Sunday. Earlier in the day the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has consistently warned against international accommodation with Iran over its nuclear ambitions, appeared on three US news shows to say the agreement was \u201ca very bad deal\u201d. \u201cA better deal would roll back Iran\u2019s vast nuclear infrastructure, and require Iran to stop its aggression in the region, its terror worldwide and its calls and actions to annihilate the state of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said on CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s a better deal. It\u2019s achievable.\u201d Obama, however, said the Iran deal was part of a broader strategy of engagement, as pursued by his administration with regards to Burma and Cuba. \u201cIf it turns out that it doesn\u2019t lead to better outcomes,\u201d Obama said, \u201cwe can adjust our policies. The same is true with respect to Iran, a larger country, a dangerous country, one that has engaged in activities that resulted in the death of US citizens, but the truth of the matter is: Iran\u2019s defence budget is $30bn. Our defence budget is closer to $600bn. \u201cIran understands that they cannot fight us \u2026 You asked about an Obama doctrine. The doctrine is: We will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities.\u201d On CNN, Netanyahu said the deal should have included a provision to curtail Iranian efforts to develop an international ballistic missile. \u201cThose missiles are only used for you,\u201d he said, referring to the US. \u201cNo one is asking Iran in this deal to stop its aggression in the region.\u201d In his long and wide-ranging conversation with Friedman, which also touched on other foreign policy concerns such as the rise of Islamic State, Obama repeated that the US remained committed to defending Israel. \u201cNow, what you might hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu, which I respect, is the notion, \u2018Look, Israel is more vulnerable. We don\u2019t have the luxury of testing these propositions the way you do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut what I would say to [Israel] is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure that they maintain their qualitative military edge \u2026 but what I\u2019m willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighbourhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them.\u201d Obama repeated the analysis of US options over Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions that he had given in the Rose Garden of the White House on Thursday and in his weekly address to the nation on Saturday: that military action or doing nothing would not have worked as well as a diplomatic solution. \u201cWe know that a military strike or a series of military strikes can set back Iran\u2019s nuclear programme for a period of time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut almost certainly will prompt Iran to rush towards a bomb, will provide an excuse for hardliners inside of Iran to say, \u2018This is what happens when you don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon: America attacks.\u2019 \u201cWe know that if we do nothing, other than just maintain sanctions, that they will continue with the building of their nuclear infrastructure and we\u2019ll have less insight into what exactly is happening.\u201d The president also discussed the impact of the Iran deal on domestic US politics, an arena in which Netanyahu made an impact with a controversial speech to Congress last month and in which Republicans are pursuing an extremely hard line. \u201cThere has to be the ability for me to disagree with a policy on settlements, for example, without being viewed as ... opposing Israel,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere has to be a way for Prime Minister Netanyahu to disagree with me on policy without being viewed as anti-Democrat.\u201d Asked about Republican attempts to secure congressional approval of the framework agreement with Iran, and thus potentially to sabotage it, Obama said he was intent on preserving the presidential prerogative to negotiate with foreign powers unfettered by Congress. But he was conciliatory towards Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the intelligence committee who has sponsored legislation on the issue. Also on Sunday, talking to Fox News Sunday, Corker \u2013 who was not among the 47 Republican senators who signed a controversial open letter to Iran last month \u2013 said the deal with Iran simply needed to be scrutinised. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could ascertain at this point whether this is good or bad for the American citizenry,\u201d he said. \u201cOn behalf of the American people, Congress needs to be playing a role.\u201d Obama told the New York Times his hope was \u201cthat we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
