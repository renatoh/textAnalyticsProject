Berry would like there to be a renters union to help strengthen the hand of tenants coping with poor conditions, insecurity and unreasonable rents. A private renter herself, she says she\u2019s lived in half a dozen different flats and houses since moving to the city, coughing up half her income in the process. Her present landlord seems to lack a decent plumber. Sadiq Khan became London mayor in May pledging to improve London\u2019s burgeoning private rented sector (PRS). His manifesto says he\u2019ll set up a London-wide, not-for-profit lettings agency for the benefit of good landlords and tenants alike, make it easier for boroughs to bring in landlord licensing schemes and name and shame bad landlords online. It also promises he\u2019ll \u201cfight for the mayor and London councils to have a greater say in strengthening renters\u2019 rights over tenancy lengths, rent rises and the quality of accommodation\u201d. How is he getting on so far? At mayor\u2019s question time on Wednesday, Khan said he\u2019d been making his case to government to be given the greater powers he requires, beginning with helping boroughs with licensing. Labour AM Tom Copley, another private renter, drew Khan\u2019s attention to an increase in the number of London children living in temporary accommodation and said that \u201c40% of Londoners who enter temporary accommodation do so because of the end of an assured, short term tenancy\u201d. This, he said, underlined a need for \u201cmore stability\u201d for tenants within the PRS, especially in light of the general economic uncertainty resulting from Brexit. He asked: \u201cIs control over tenancy now on the table in terms of devolution?\u201d Khan said, reasonably enough: \u201cWho knows?\u201d He revealed that it hadn\u2019t been on the table of the previous communities secretary, Greg Clark, with whom progress on housing issues in general had been good. Now someone else, Sajid Javid, is in the job. My guess is it won\u2019t be on his table either. Copley then asked Khan about progress with his London Living Rent policy, which would see a new PRS tenure introduced in the capital for some new homes, with rents pegged to one third of average local earnings - a lot lower than the current norm. \u201cA lot of that boils down to the deal we can make with DCLG [Department for Communities and Local Government],\u201d Khan replied. \u201cI\u2019m due to speak to new secretary of state later this week. I hope to meet him shortly.\u201d Copley asked if the London Living Rent policy could be implemented without government co-operation. \u201cGood question,\u201d replied Khan. His answer, in short, was that it could be realised through borough planning agreements right away. Housing market experts have not demurred, telling the Financial Times that incorporating such rent-indexed dwellings within \u201caffordable\u201d obligations wouldn\u2019t be hard. But more such homes could be supplied in London if that deal Khan is seeking to strike with the government is a good one. We\u2019re talking money, we\u2019re talking subsidy. Surprise, surprise. Khan also underlined his wish to \u201chelp renters by rooting out the minority of bad landlords who let the whole sector down\u201d. This recognition that most landlords aren\u2019t crooked or inept has not gone unnoticed by the Residential Landlords Association (RLA), whose members have backed his \u201cname and shame\u201d plan. The RLA opposes landlord licensing, arguing that it doesn\u2019t tackle the criminal element and takes up borough time that would be better spent making more effective use of enforcement muscle they already have. The RLA won\u2019t be alone in spotting that new housing minister Gavin Barwell has been a firm critic of licensing. The fact that Barwell, who is the MP for Croydon Central, has also been made minister for London may seem to bode ill for Khan. That said, a commitment to nobbling out-and-out villain landlords is common ground and in line with the more positive provisions of the Housing and Planning Act. RLA policy director David Smith argues that borough officers sometimes don\u2019t fully understand the existing powers at their command, which are quite complex. And, as ever, there\u2019s a shortage of resources. He thinks the mayor could address this by, for example, \u201cseed funding a programme for enhanced enforcement in a couple of boroughs as part of his drive to improve standards\u201d. Smith feels his early interactions with the new City Hall regime have been useful. Si\u00e2n Berry, meanwhile, says her Big Renters Survey has already collected \u201csome genuine horror stories\u201d. Both could contribute to Khan\u2019s attempts to improve London\u2019s PRS. Building broad alliances is one of the ways London mayors get things done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
