A belief in whether government has the power, let alone the policies, to restore living standards also appears to be one of the issues that most determines which party voters will back. Only 22% of current Conservative voters and 27% of Liberal Democrats think that with the right policies living standards would rise to 2008 levels in the next two or three years. By contrast, nearly 55% of Labour supporters believe the right policy could improve the economy. The findings in a YouGov poll for the Resolution Foundation thinktank underline why the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, says his biggest opponent at the next election will be voters' fatalism and lack of faith in politics. The disillusionment will also worry the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, a passionate advocate of government-led demand policies to boost growth. The poll finds 65% of Conservative voters agree with the statement: \"lLooking to the 2015 election and beyond, the most we can expect of government is to secure a stable economic and business environment with sound public finances.\" But 70% of Labour supporters agree: \"It is possible for government with the right policies to ensure that overall growth in the economy results in steadily rising living standards.\" Only 27% of Conservative supporters agree with this statement. The polling also seeks sought to probe voters' attitudes as to what is likely to be a central battleground at the next election: whether the first priority should be cutting the deficit or restoring growth. Nearly four-fifths (78%) agree with the statement: \"The most important thing British governments, whichever party is in control, will have to do in the next few years is to manage the public finances prudently.\" But voters also agree, by by the exactly the same margin, with the statement: \"For me to trust a party on the economy, I need to know that it will make growth its No 1 priority.\" Pressed to say whether growth or prudent public finances come first, voters by 49% to 38% opt for growth, a result that will be a relief to Balls and the shadow treasury team. Conservative Tory supporters prioritise prudent financial management over the promotion of growth by 62% to 30%; Labour supporters think growth promotion should come first (21% versus 69%), while Liberal Democrats are evenly split (45% versus 49%). Such is the pessimism among poorer voters that one in three earning less than \u00a320,000 a year do not believe a recovery would help their living standards, although that figure falls to a fifth among only a fifth of richer voters. Asked which two or three measures would do most to ease the pressure on living standards, 65% cite reducing the cost of essentials such as food and fuel, 47% a petrol duty cut and 35% a VAT cut. Younger voters favour action on housing costs. Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Despite the stagnation of recent years, including in the period prior to the recession, the majority of people still think that with the right policies growth will translate into steadily rising living standards. \"They want their share of the future gains from growth. However, a large minority appear to have lost faith in this belief, which is concerning, given that the legitimacy of our economy rests on it.\" Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, said: \"Politicians who look for a clear lead from the public will look in vain. Voters know that over time Britain needs to cut the deficit and create more jobs, but they are divided on which should come first. \"The larger truth is that pessimism abounds. The dominant mood is that things will continue to get worse. The challenge of political leadership is not just to decide the best policies but to frame a plausible narrative that can dispel the gloom. I cannot recall a time when so many voters had so little faith in the ability of politicians to secure prosperity.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
