The justice and security bill proposes that ministers can order judges to hear sensitive evidence, such as that provided by security services, in \"closed material proceedings\" (CMPs) \u2013 the most controversial practical measure of the bill beyond the principle of using secret courts at all. However, David Cameron said on Tuesday he believed judges rather than ministers should make the final decision \u2013 something the House of Lords has voted for in an amendment but which has not yet been accepted by ministers. \"It will always be a judge who decides \u2026 not ministers,\" the prime minister told the liaison committee, comprising all the MPs who chair Commons committees. Pressed by Sir Alan Beith, the committee's chairman, as to whether he had accepted the Lords amendment, Cameron retreated, saying he did not want to make commitments on behalf of Kenneth Clarke, the cabinet minister without portfolio who is overseeing the bill. Afterwards, a government source said the official position had not changed since Clarke put out a statement last month saying he would consider the Lords' amendments and \"test them against the objectives of the bill\". He said at the time: \"I will look carefully at these amendments which do not immediately seem to me disastrous, but may well need to be modified.\" Reflecting the confusion that the committee was left in, Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative member who pressed Cameron on the issue, later put out a statement suggesting that if the prime minister was not announcing a concession, his evidence suggested he was not well briefed on the issue. \"It was clear from the prime minister's evidence today that he has not yet had an opportunity to hear all the arguments on this,\" said Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee. \"The government must now accept the amendments proposed by the Lords and allow the judge to have the final say on whether CMPs should be used in a case and to ensure that CMPs are used only as a last resort.\" Even if government does accept the amendment, there will still be strong opposition from some critics. \"Co-opting the judiciary into secret courts is as cynical as it is counterproductive,\" said Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty. \"Current law already protects national security and the government can't point to a single case of judges forcing the exposure of state secrets.\" In wide-ranging questioning, Cameron defended the planning minister, Nick Boles, who recently said the UK would have to cover another 2-3% of its land to meet the need to build 100,000 more homes a year. \"We all want to see fewer empty homes; we all want to see more homes on brownfield sites; we all want to see effective conversion of buildings, but that isn't enough,\" said Cameron. \"[Boles] was making an honest and inevitable point \u2026 we will on occasion have to build on some greenfield sites and we will have to see planning permits ... and we have to be honest about it.\" Cameron risked angering environmental groups with a strong defence of the recently announced policy to expand the number of gas-fired power stations and extend fracking for gas from reserves in shale. Campaigners say that without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is not yet commercially working, the gas rush would lead to the UK breaching its internationally agreed and legally binding targets to cut carbon dioxide emissions linked to climate change. \"It may be this gas revolution is really quite transformative: it may be there will be quite a lot of gas and the price will not be as [high],\" he said. \"This might be a revolution we should be involved in and, if we ignored it completely, we could be giving your economy much higher energy policies than are necessary.\" Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"By appearing to bet the farm on carbon capture and storage as the way Britain can burn more fossil fuels and simultaneously cut carbon emissions, the prime minister indicated he's willing to take a big and unnecessary risk with energy bills and the environment, given gas prices are rising and CCS remains an expensive and unproven technology.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
