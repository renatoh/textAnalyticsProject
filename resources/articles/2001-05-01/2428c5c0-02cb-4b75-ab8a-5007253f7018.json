The commitment, which will appear on a special \"pledge card\", is on the face of it marginally more ambitious than the staff recruitment targets outlined in its NHS plan published last year. It appears to add 500 doctors to its NHS plan commitment. The plan promises 20,000 extra nurses and 9,500 extra doctors - comprising 7,500 more consultants and 2,000 GPs. The pledge succeeds the controversial commitment made at the last general election to cut inpatient waiting lists by 100,000 over the course of a parliament. Although Labour has met the waiting list pledge, it did so after much struggle and, critics argue, only by skewing waiting list priorities by pushing simple routine cases through as the expense of more complex urgent operations. The health pledge reads: \"20,000 extra nurses and 10,000 extra doctors in a reformed NHS. As we improve NHS care for all not push patients into paying for operations.\" The five pledges are: \u0095 Mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances \u0095 10,000 extra teachers and higher standards in secondary schools \u0095 20,000 extra nurses and 10,000 extra doctors in a reformed NHS \u0095 6,000 extra recruits to raise police numbers to their highest level yet \u0095 Pensioners' winter fuel payment retained, minimum wage rising to \u00a34.20."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
