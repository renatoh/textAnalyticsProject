Mr Straw saw the prime minister in Downing Street this morning, and received the best wishes of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesmen as he delivered an address on the summit, which was aimed at reaching further agreement on the proposed EU constitution. That debate then divided along usual party political lines, with the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, demanding a UK referendum on the treaty, and Mr Straw urging MPs to \"take the time to read the actual constitution, and not the transcripts provided by Conservative central office\". And he dismissed as \"wonderful and wacky - but simply not true\" press stories last week that any constitution would reduce the Queen to merely \"a citizen of the EU\". Mr Straw told the house that on defence it made sense for Europe to be able to act in circumstances where Nato does not want to. However, he said it would be unacceptable \"for the EU unrealistically to aspire to provide a territorial defence commitment\" - something which should remain a matter for Nato. Turning to Iraq the foreign secretary acknowledged that the security situation, especially in Baghdad, \"is not satisfactory\". The foreign secretary is to fly to Tehran tonight with the foreign ministers of France and Germany to try to persuade Iran to step back from moves towards any nuclear capability. But it was over Europe that Mr Straw and Mr Ancram clashed most of all. \"The draft constitutional treaty is designed to improve the way the EU works after enlargement by reform, clarification and consolidation,\" Mr Straw insisted. \"The claims made by the opposition and others that the treaty would undermine Britain's independence are frankly absurd. \"These are, in truth, arguments not against the draft treaty - but against British membership of the EU. \"The logic of the Conservative front bench ... would be to take Britain out of the EU altogether and the British people need to know that.\" But Mr Ancram accused ministers of trying to treat the British people as if they were \"stupid\" and again demanded a referendum. \"Why are the government so frightened of the British people?\" he demanded. \"You should promise them a referendum today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
