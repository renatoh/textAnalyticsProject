Gomez has been out since fracturing his lower left leg at Burnley on 5 December. The 21-year-old was expected to be absent for six weeks but, almost 10 weeks later, his manager has conceded the Champions League first leg against Bayern Munich on 19 February is not \u201ca realistic target\u201d. Liverpool also fear Dejan Lovren has suffered a recurrence of a hamstring injury, with the central defender almost certain to miss Monday\u2019s visit to West Ham. The unfortunate Gomez, who missed last season\u2019s Champions League final and World Cup following ankle surgery, has been seeing a specialist during his latest rehabilitation. He is expected to visit a specialist again to assess whether more surgery is needed. \u201cIt is not exactly going how we want \u2013 that\u2019s how it is,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe needs more time. We will see exactly how we do it. There were different moments we thought we could do this or that but it will take time. We can not say more.\u201d Asked whether Gomez required another operation, the manager replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. We will see. It is possible, probably.\u201d With Trent Alexander-Arnold ruled out of Monday\u2019s game as he recovers from a knee ligament injury, and Jordan Henderson deputising for the suspended James Milner at right-back against Leicester in midweek, Klopp admitted loaning Nathaniel Clyne to Bournemouth was not ideal. \u201cI can imagine people think that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it. In the moment we did it there were different reasons. Then an hour later people could say: \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 Milly got suspended and Trent injured \u2013 or the other way around. Is that perfect? I don\u2019t think so. You make the decision in the moment you have to and then people judge it later. Hendo did well. We all know how good Clyney is, but would he have had more offensive influence in the game? I don\u2019t know. Defensively I did not see a mistake from Hendo.\u201d Klopp has responded to Kyle Walker trolling Liverpool on Twitter by insisting it is unacceptable to mock fellow professionals for dropping points. The Manchester City defender tweeted, then deleted, a meme of Harry Maguire along with the caption: \u201cSo basically they thought they were gonna go 7 points ahead ...\u201d after Leicester\u2019s 1-1 draw at Anfield. Klopp said: \u201cI never celebrated another team dropping points or losing a game. For me that\u2019s not allowed \u2026 For supporters it\u2019s a bit different. For people involved I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
