Harrison, 23, has been told by the promoter Frank Warren that he is close to a shot at the WBO version of the world featherweight title, long the preserve of Naseem Hamed but now held by the Argentine Julio Pablo Chacon. Chacon defends his title at York Hall on Saturday week against Colombia's Victor Polo, with the winner to face the American Johnny Tapia, the former four-times world champion at junior-bantamweight and bantamweight, who also fights on the London bill. \"Provided Scott keeps winning he can go all the way,\" said Warren. \"He looked sensational when he stopped Steve Robinson [a former WBO champion] in his last fight. Chacon has this one, then he or Polo gets Tapia, and Scott will be there after that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
