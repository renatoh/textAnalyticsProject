Reduced to 10 men from eight minutes before the interval, Smith's team may have conceded an equaliser to Lee Miller but they demonstrated exactly the level of spirit in the remaining 53 minutes that will be required to halt Celtic's quest for a third title in succession. Strachan's side lead the Premier League by two points, but Rangers have two eminently winnable matches in hand, against Gretna and St Mirren. Celtic's recent indifferent run - they have taken six league points from a possible 15 - may yet cost them. Charlie Adam had prodded the visitors in front here by the time five minutes of madness culminated in a red card for Lee McCulloch. The Rangers full-back Alan Hutton, a player being tracked by Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United but not averse to moments of lunacy, displayed the less endearing features of his character with a reckless lunge on Chris Clark as the ball was rolling out of play. What followed involved Clark seeking retribution with a rash challenge on Hutton before McCulloch crashed into Scott Severin amid the melee. Barry Ferguson was fortunate to escape punishment for his part in proceedings. Smith was miffed by the fact McCulloch was dismissed on the say-so of the assistant referee, although his ire would have been better directed at the former Wigan Athletic midfielder who should have acted more calmly with his team in control. The Aberdeen manager, Jimmy Calderwood, said Rangers had been \"cruising\" up to that point. \"It's funny how a linesman will run 70 yards to get a player sent off but won't run to get the ball,\" was Smith's comment on events. \"If he wants to be a referee, let him be a referee, not a linesman.\" Adam had rounded off a fine move, involving Hutton and McCulloch, to emphasise Rangers' early momentum after half an hour. Smith's team actually had nine men on the field - Kevin Thomson had been receiving treatment - when Miller headed home from close range in first-half stoppage time. Despite their numerical disadvantage, Rangers created the more meaningful second-half openings, with Steven Naismith the outstanding performer. Daniel Cousin tripped over the ball when clean through on Jamie Langfield, Aberdeen's goalkeeper. Zander Diamond came within inches of slicing one of several Naismith crosses into his own net. \"Our passing was sluggish and defensively we were poor so I am happy with the point,\" said Calderwood, who conceded his players never threatened to reach the heights of Thursday's epic 4-0 Uefa Cup victory over Copenhagen.
