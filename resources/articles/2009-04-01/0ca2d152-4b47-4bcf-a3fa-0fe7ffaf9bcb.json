The Arsenal manager had just seen Lukasz Fabianski's reckless bolt from his line contribute heavily to the team's FA Cup semi-final defeat and the question of when the first-choice goalkeeper, Manuel Almunia, would return from injury was upon him. \"We don't know,\" Wenger replied solemnly. Would it be in time for the first leg of the Champions League semi-final at Manchester United on Wednesday week? \"I don't know, I don't know, personally.\" The good news for Fabianski is that he stands to have one of the club's biggest ever matches in which to make amends for what can fairly be described as his horror show against Chelsea at Wembley. There are also the Premier League fixtures against Liverpool and Middlesbrough before the trip to Old Trafford. The bad news, though, is that the Poland international is at his lowest ebb and there have to be doubts over his capacity to bounce back. Opponents will be licking their lips in anticipation of targeting him. It was Fabianski's 24th birthday on Saturday but this was no way to celebrate. His costly error had been signposted. In the fourth minute he charged from his penalty area to find himself, somewhat ludicrously, going up for a header with Didier Drogba. There was only one winner in that duel and Fabianski needed Kieran Gibbs, the 19-year-old left-back who emerged with credit, to race back and scramble the ball from going into the goal. Fabianski was also slow to get down to a Florent Malouda drive that fizzed across him and past the far post before he was beaten inside his near post by the same player for the equaliser. Drogba's winning goal prompted him to sink to his knees and clutch his head in his hands. Fabianski never looked like reaching the ball first and Drogba rounded him comfortably before applying the dagger to his heart. At full-time Fabianski was a snap-shot in desolation. None of his team-mates went within yards of him as he left the pitch and it was only Chelsea's Petr Cech who gave him a consoling embrace. Every member of the goalkeeping union has been there himself, Cech particularly so of late, and only they can fully appreciate the pain. Wenger's project to build his fourth great Arsenal team from a youthful base remains on track but individual lapses are an inevitable pitfall en route and he was forced to admit that Chelsea's greater maturity had played its part. That, together with other similarly practical qualities which clearly do not appeal overly to him. \"It's all based on power and efficiency,\" said Wenger, who felt his team was \"a bit jaded physically\". \"I didn't feel Chelsea were dominating the game but they played to be efficient. When you get closer to the trophies, that has a part to play. They know where to stand on the pitch and you feel that if one team will take advantage of a mistake made, it will be them.\" John Terry, the Chelsea captain, was asked whether he felt Arsenal's inexperience showed. \"At times,\" he replied. \"They have got some very good and intelligent young players and in another year or two, they will be dominating for Arsenal for years to come. ''With experienced players like William Gallas out [on Saturday] ... when you mix that youth and experience, it's key. So when the experienced players are out, you miss them.\" Almunia has been out since he limped from the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at Villarreal two weeks ago. In the middle of last month he had been caught on the foot by a studs-up lunge by Blackburn's El Hadji Diouf, that caused no little anger at Arsenal, and when Almunia left his penalty area to challenge Villarreal's Giuseppe Rossi, he suffered a knock on the same spot. As the club's medics work to patch him up, the psychological repairs have started on Fabianski. \"I firmly believe that he will be one of the greatest keepers in the world,\" said Wenger. \"He has the talent, he's intelligent, he's brave and is very good technically. He was not at his best against Chelsea and you have to accept that can happen to anyone. It happened to Cech last Tuesday against Liverpool in the Champions League.\" Although Gallas is out for the season with knee ligament damage, Bacary Sagna ought to return from illness at Liverpool tomorrow night while Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Wenger's remaining first-choice defender, hopes to have recovered from a back injury in time for the first leg against United. \"It will be difficult to lift them for Liverpool,\" said Wenger, \"but these guys are winners and they have gone through more difficult times than this.\" Fabianski will be under the most intense of spotlights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
