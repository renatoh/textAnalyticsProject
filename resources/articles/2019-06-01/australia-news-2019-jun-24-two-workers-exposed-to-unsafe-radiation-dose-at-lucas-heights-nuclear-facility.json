Just two weeks after it was granted a licence to enter into full domestic production, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) has confirmed production at its new $168m nuclear medicine facility has been halted after \u201ca safety incident\u201d on Friday morning. Ansto said three of its workers were \u201cattended to by radiation protection personnel\u201d after the incident, in which contamination was detected on the outside of a container holding 42 millilitres of the radioisotope molybdenum-99 (Mo-99). Two of those workers received a radiation dose above the legal limit roughly equivalent to a conventional cancer radiation therapy treatment, an Ansto spokesman said. \u201cAnsto has launched an urgent investigation after three employees were involved in a safety incident at our brand new nuclear medicine facility,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cAn investigation commenced on Friday, and both the nuclear regulator, Arpansa, and Comcare have been informed. An estimate of the radiation dose will be confirmed in coming weeks. \u201cEarly calculations indicate that the radiation dose received by two of the workers involved in medicine processing was equivalent to that of a conventional radiation therapy treatment. \u201cAn occupational physician will continue to provide ongoing observation. All three workers involved are receiving ongoing support from Ansto.\u201d Located at the Lucas Heights nuclear facility in Sydney\u2019s south, the $168m nuclear medicine facility was announced by the federal government in 2012 with the goal of tripling Australian production of Mo-99, the parent isotope of Technetium-99m. The isotope is used in hospitals and nuclear medicine centres to diagnose a variety of heart, lung, organ and musculoskeletal conditions. The facility only received approval to enter into full domestic production on 13 June this year. At the time, the Ansto chief executive, Dr Adi Paterson, called it \u201cthe most advanced and safest manufacturing facility for nuclear medicine on the planet today\u201d. \u201cThis is a highly sophisticated manufacturing facility that will see the shire contributing strongly to health outcomes for patients across Australia, and the wait has been worth it,\u201d Paterson said. However, in a statement on Monday, Ansto said it would now conduct an investigation into the \u201cdesign, manufacture, operations, protocols and procedures as well as training\u201d at the facility. \u201cVital supplies of molybdenum-99 nuclear medicine are currently being provided through alternative facilities at Ansto, while the investigation is under way,\u201d the spokesman said. It is the second contamination scare at the Lucas Heights facility in only a few months. In March three staff at the Lucas Heights nuclear facility were taken to hospital after they were exposed to sodium hydroxide when a cap came off a pipe in the nuclear medicine manufacturing building."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
