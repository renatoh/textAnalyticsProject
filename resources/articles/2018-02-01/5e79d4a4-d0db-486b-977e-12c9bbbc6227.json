The Italian\u2019s relationship with the Chelsea hierarchy has always been strained over recruitment policy, echoing similar disagreements through his three-year stint in charge at Juventus, and he has conceded publicly in recent weeks that Chelsea cannot compete financially with the Manchester clubs. That much was clear last month when having hoped the champions might spend lavishly on Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Alex Sandro and Virgil van Dijk they eventually secured Emerson Palmieri, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud for a combined \u00a350m. The France forward should make his first start for the visit of West Bromwich Albion to Stamford Bridge on Monday, when Conte will hope victory eases some of the pressure that has built over a run of two wins in 10 games in all competitions. The Italian went into the weekend with the joint highest win percentage \u2013 70.3%, alongside Pep Guardiola \u2013 of any manager in Premier League history and, while he is convinced he improves players through his coaching, he acknowledges there are other aspects of the role he has yet to master. Asked if he thought anyone could do a better job with the players now at his disposal, Conte said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Usually? Usually in my experience, I reached the best results possible with the players I have to work with. I think that I\u2019m the type of coach who if I have a player who is 6/10, I bring him to an 8/10. If I have a player who is 8/10, I take him to 10/10. I\u2019m this type of coach. \u201cMy task is to try and improve every single player, in every aspect. In terms of their mentality also. And their desire, their will to fight, and all the tactical aspects. My task is this and, for this, I\u2019m very good. But I think I\u2019m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players. I think in this aspect I can improve a lot. \u201cI have to learn a lot from the other coaches, the other managers, in that aspect. I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players. One way might be to stop improving the players I have ... yes, you are not the first person to tell me this.\u201d While there is an acceptance that the Italian will move on in the summer despite having another year to run on his contract, Chelsea have been reluctant to make a change in the dugout mid-season. Reports in Spain have suggested Luis Enrique, the former Barcelona manager who is believed to be keen to work in England, has verbally agreed personal terms with the Premier League champions, though the Stamford Bridge club insist they have not made contact with any potential successor. Conte knows Enrique from the latter\u2019s spell in charge of Roma, and has a lot of respect for the 47-year-old who is favourite to succeed him. \u201cI have spoken with him, and he\u2019s a really good person,\u201d said Conte. \u201cI have great admiration for Luis Enrique and he is a fantastic coach.,He reached his targets with Barcelona, and also with Roma. You could see a well-organised team. I can speak about him very well, as a person and a coach. \u201cWe do this job, and our job is not \u2018difficult\u2019, but you must be open and understand the situation can change. A club can take different decisions. It\u2019s the same for me. But, I repeat, I\u2019m not jealous or envious of other managers. Everyone knows his job, his work. I have, usually, a great respect [for fellow managers].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
