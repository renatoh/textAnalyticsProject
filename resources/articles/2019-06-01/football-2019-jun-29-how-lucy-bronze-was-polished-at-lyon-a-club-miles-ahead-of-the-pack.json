Now, two days on from that wonder strike against Norway, she is back on terra firma in Lyon, the French city that has long been the ultimate finishing school for her and other world-class players, preparing for England\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final against the USA on Tuesday. When Bronze moved to France from Manchester City in 2017 she was already an excellent player. Now she is an elite one. And she knows why. \u201cThe standard across Europe is set by Lyon,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re so far ahead of so many teams. In training every day it\u2019s 11 internationals v 11 internationals, so I\u2019m having to defend against the world\u2019s best strikers every day. \u201cAt the start it was hard, and for the first month I couldn\u2019t get near the ball in training. Then I got up to speed. It\u2019s definitely been the right move.\u201d The bald statistics are striking. Lyon have steamrollered their way to the last 13 titles in France\u2019s Division 1 F\u00e9minine, as well as the last four Champions Leagues, making them without any doubt, the greatest club team in women\u2019s football history. For good measure they also have 16 players at this Women\u2019s World Cup, including England\u2019s Nikita Parris, who recently joined from City, as well as the Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Ada Hegerberg, who declined to play because she did not think Norway\u2019s setup was professional enough. Hegerberg\u2019s tone is very different when it comes to talking about Lyon, calling them \u201cthe perfect model of how you should run a modern club\u201d. You can see why. While many other clubs pay lip service to women\u2019s football, Lyon push it at the front and centre. The women\u2019s teams from the academy upwards, for instance, share facilities with the men \u2013 including training pitches, medical staff and a cryotherapy chamber. There is also \u201cthe mental cell\u201d which helps with the psychological pressures of performing. And as Dahbia Hattabi, the Lyon correspondent for Foot Mercato in France explains, ideas are exchanged and fermented between staff too. \u201cThere is a lot of interaction between coaches of both teams, and the players know each other well too,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is together for both teams to think only football. The only difference is that the men play at Groupama Stadium, while the women only play there for big matches, usually in the Champions League.\u201d Lyon\u2019s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, who started the women\u2019s team in 2004, also regularly comes to watch and provides charter jets for the players. Recently he also recruited a new coach, Jean-Luc Vasseur, who has managed in Ligue 1 with Reims. It is difficult to imagine an English Women\u2019s Super League club attracting \u2013 or being able to pay \u2013 someone with such experience. \u201cBut you notice the little things at Lyon too,\u201d says Laetitia B\u00e9raud, a women\u2019s football writer at Le Monde. \u201cFor instance they will often weigh each player before and after training and matches to track hydration levels in order to make sure each player is at their best level. That shows how professional the club is.\u201d But B\u00e9raud insists there is something else as well: an understanding that both sexes are treated the same way from the top level down to the kids. \u201cI am 26 now, but even when I was growing up in Lyon we knew the club was scouting girls as well as boys to join their academy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seemed normal to us. Only later did I realise how radical that was. It allowed girls to dream they could make it as a professional too. \u201cI\u2019d also highlight the attitude of the men\u2019s team too. At training it is not unusual to see them happily watching and waiting for the women to finish. In many clubs the women would be not be allowed to use those same facilities \u2013 they would be for the men\u2019s teams only.\u201d Crucially, they pay well, too. When L\u2019\u00c9quipe published the salaries of the top French players at the World Cup they were led by Lyon\u2019s Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry on \u20ac29,000 (\u00a326,000) a month, with several other Lyon players on between \u20ac10,000-\u20ac18,000. Meanwhile Hegerberg is reportedly on somewhere around \u20ac34,000 a month. True, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will earn about 70 times that much. But for the women\u2019s game these are extraordinary figures, especially for a team that does not regularly attract more than a few thousand supporters each week. It is also telling that Lyon recently sold their TV rights to Canal+ for \u20ac1.2m a year. In 2017 that same deal was for \u20ac200,000 leading you to wonder what it might be in another two years\u2019 time. So how have Lyon been so successful? It helps that they established a women\u2019s team early. They were not quite the first movers \u2013 Montpellier established their women\u2019s team before them \u2013 but they were up and running in 2004, while most English clubs only started to merge their operations when the women\u2019s domestic league turned professional in 2010. Incredibly, two of the biggest clubs in Europe, Manchester United and Real Madrid, have only launched women\u2019s teams in the past year. Lyon\u2019s men dominated French football in the early 2000s but a sharp dip in their performances coincided with the national women\u2019s team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2011. \u201cThat was a revelation,\u201d says B\u00e9raud. \u201cWe had never seen women\u2019s football on public TV and when the semi-final happened a lot of people got interested, they saw a lot of players were from Lyon. That definitely sparked a massive interest in the women\u2019s team. Now they are very popular.\u201d Aulas increased his investment in Lyon\u2019s women\u2019s team. As Anthony Hernandez of Le Monde explains, he was motivated by a mixture of idealism and pragmatism. \u201cI think Aulas understood earlier than most this was the right thing to do but also that he didn\u2019t have to put [in] too much money to dominate the women\u2019s game.\u201d Hernandez also cites the smart recruitment policy \u2013 which has included bringing in the captains of Germany and Japan, Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n and Saki Kumagai, as well as players such as Bronze and Parris \u2013 as important factors. However, he insists it is not just about money. \u201cPSG and Manchester City could spend more money on the women\u2019s game than Lyon, and maybe one day they will. But can they replicate the culture?\u201d he asks. \u201cThat is the big thing here. The women\u2019s players really feel like they are part of the club. Other teams might let them wear the shirt but otherwise they make them feel like second-class citizens.\u201d And Hattabi, who follows Lyon more closely than most, does not see their superiority ending any time soon. \u201cThey always want to win and they plan to dominate France and Europe for several more years,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like they are resting on their laurels. There are young players like Selma Bacha and England\u2019s Nikita Parris arriving so the next generation is ready \u2013 and waiting to fire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
