They are about to spend the week on their hands and knees scrabbling over the Utah desert. Their goal is simple: they are seeking intact fragments of cargo from the $150-million Genesis spacecraft that plunged out of the sky last week and buried itself in a large sandy crater outside Salt Lake City. It was an ignominious end to a mission that had promised so much. For two years, Genesis - carrying suntraps made of wafers of gold, diamond and sapphire - had been hovering a million miles from Earth, gathering billions of atoms of primordial material as they streamed from the sun. This payload was to be used by scientists to gain key insights into the formation of the sun and the planets - our own world included. It was not to be. A parachute failed and Genesis, filled with its precious particles, hit the Utah desert, as dismayed scientists looked on. 'There was a big pit in my stomach. This just wasn't supposed to happen,' Roger Wiens, Genesis's flight payload chief, said yesterday. 'On the other hand, we are still hopeful. We can see that some of the solar wind wafers still look intact.' It remains to be seen if these fragments are too contaminated to provide useful data. Most scientists remain gloomy. Indeed, it was noticeable that before the Utah sands had even settled over Genesis's wreckage, scientists were calling for a replacement mission. Such hopes may be naive, but they also reveal an intensity of commitment, not just for space science in general, but for solar research in particular. And this is a crucial point: Genesis was no one-off probe to the sun, but was one of a flotilla of spacecraft and ground-based missions that have recently transformed our knowledge of our nearest star. 'This is the golden age of solar science,' said Professor Eric Priest, of St Andrews University. 'Losing Genesis was a blow, but there is so much more we are learning about the sun - and it is going to have a profound impact on all our lives.' In mines deep below the ground, scientists have created lakes of detergents which they use to trap phantom-like particles called neutrinos emitted by the sun; in orbit, satellites like Soho (the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) monitor magnetic sun storms big enough to swallow the Earth; and on mountain peaks in Hawaii and Chile, astronomers are studying the sun in unprecedented detail. And after all, no other object in the universe, outside our own planet, is more important to our well-being. The sun's emissions drive our weather and climate. It is our closest connection to the basic forces that control the universe. And of course, without the sun's warming rays, life would be impossible. Virtually every source of energy we possess - with the exception of nuclear power - is derived from solar radiation. Coal and oil are by-products of plants and animals that once thrived in ancient sunlight. Yet we now know the light that provided this precious sustenance has taken a very long time to reach us. The sunbeams that shine on us today began their journey before the last ice age and needed hundreds of thousands of years to push their way through the maelstrom of activity below the sun's surface. 'It is incredibly hot and dense down there,' said Professor Richard Harrison, of the Rutherford Laboratory. 'Light is generated by particles and is then absorbed and re-emitted by other particles. The process goes on for aeons before light can reach the surface.' After that, it is a mere eight-minute skip across the 93-million mile gap to the Earth. 'The sun is not a simple ball of incandescent gas in which hydrogen is quietly being transformed by nuclear fusion into helium,' he added. 'It seethes with activity. Satellites images make it look more like a great plate of writhing spaghetti. Great loops of energy shimmer and twist and occasionally break, hurling huge globs of matter, made up of millions of cubic kilometres of plasma, into space.' And when these coronal mass ejections, as they are known, strike Earth, we feel the impact. Powerful aurora displays appear over the poles, the electronics on satellites are fried, and entire power grids are disrupted. In 1989 a solar storm plunged Quebec into darkness, leaving seven million people without electricity. 'Basically, when the sun sneezes we all catch a cold,' said Cambridge astronomer Paul Murdin. In an attempt to understand this solar influenza, a flotilla of four European satellites called Cluster is now swooping around the sun, analysing the streams of particles that pour from its surface. The aim is to predict storms that could otherwise devastate our modern electronically dependant world. But the sun does more than merely disrupt communications and power. Scientists have found that during the 17th and 18th century, sunspots completely disappeared. At the same time, the world plunged into a period called the Little Ice Age. Inuit paddled kayaks from Greenland to tour Scotland's icy coastline, snow fell in summertime, while crops failed and famines killed millions. Scientists believe the two phenomena - cold and lack of sunspots - are closely connected. 'We still do not exactly understand the correlation, but it is clear that the sun does not behave in a static, unchanging manner and these alterations have a major impact on our climate,' Priest said. 'Given humanity's role in triggering global warming, it is vital we discover if the sun is going to mitigate or enhance man-made global warming.' Such interest explains the armada being sent, or about to be sent, to study the sun. As well as Soho and Cluster, new missions include Stereo - in which one spaceship will fly ahead of and another behind Earth as it orbits, creating 3-D images of the sun - and Solar Orbiter, which will swoop close to the sun's surface to gain a detailed view of its surface. The lessons learned will be of critical importance not just to understanding our own planet but in providing a key to the rest of the universe. 'The sun gives us our only chance to study another star,' said the Open University's Professor Colin Pillinger, one of the scientists who had been hoping to study particles returned by Genesis. 'The planets were all created from debris left over from the sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. We also know that the moon and Earth are isotopically very similar and must have a common origin. Mars is different, however. So we want to know which - Earth or Mars - is more like the sun. If Earth is different, we will then want to know why. Perhaps we are made of material left over from an earlier part of the universe's history.' It is a fairly dramatic prospect, and explains why astronomers are so fascinated by the sun. It also explains why scientists will be spending all that time and effort, scrabbling on their knees looking for fragments of Genesis's cargo on the Utah desert floor this week. A little bit of sunshine could tell us an awful lot. Light of our lives \u00b7 The sun is 70 per cent hydrogen and 28 per cent helium. The rest mainly carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. \u00b7 It is 6,000C at its surface; 15,000,000C at its core. \u00b7 Its diameter is 870,000 miles, 109 times larger than the Earth's. Over a million Earths can fit in its volume. \u00b7 Average distance from the Earth is 93 million miles. The next nearest star is 24 billion billion miles away. \u00b7 The Wayuu people of South America believe the sun and moon are procreating during eclipses and so avert their eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
