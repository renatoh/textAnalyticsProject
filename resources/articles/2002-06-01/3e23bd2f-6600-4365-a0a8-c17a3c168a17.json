He was also filled with anxiety. His hometown of Urawa had one of the 10 teams in the new J.League, and he hoped for a local version of what he had seen from Europe on television - thousands of noisy fans singing their support for the Urawa Reds. When he first went to watch the team, however, it was all too quiet. Worse still, the Reds turned out to be useless, easily the weakest club in the league. So Yoshizawa took things into his own hands. He stood at the front of the crowd and, through a megaphone, told them what to do. Eventually, supporters got the message. They draped their stands in red banners and chanted 'U-ra-wa Re-zzu!' Soon he was the leader of the noisiest and most passionate supporters in Japan. When he arrived on the terrace, the crowd would part to let him through to the front, where he stood, bare-chested, to bellow the cues. 'I was the boss,' he remembers. 'I thought that even if the team was no good, if we had fun in the stands we could make Reds games exciting. Talking through the megaphone was a kind of enlightenment movement.' People such as Yoshizawa are one of the main reasons why Japanese football has survived and, in some parts of the country, flourished - even if the Japanese crowd at England-Cameroon last weekend created an atmosphere like that at Lord's. When professional football arrived in 1993, the J.League founders planned everything impeccably. They travelled to Europe to study club management, and to the United States, where NFL marketing experts gave them tips on commercialisation. The new clubs signed star players from around the world - including Zico, Dunga and Jorginho from Brazil, Ramon Diaz from Argentina, Toto Schillaci from Italy and Gary Lineker from England - to raise standards and bring in the fans, while dozens of foreign coaches were hired to pass on their knowledge. But just as the crowds did not spontaneously provide an atmosphere, the lack of an indigenous football culture left players struggling with leadership, initiative and the desire to win. 'The younger Japanese players are maybe better than Europeans in technical areas,' says Japan's World Cup coach Philippe Troussier, a Frenchman. This is not the case in terms of mental attitude, though. 'My challenge is to prepare the players to play against aggressive foreign sides,' says Troussier. Ten years ago, that was an even harder task. Zico went to Japan to play for Kashima Antlers and loved Japanese players because they were so keen to learn. Sometimes, though, this went too far. When he first gave post-match talks, some players wrote down every word he said. A few minutes before the next match, they would take out these notes and start revising, as if for a test. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger faced a similar problem when he went to coach Nagoya Grampus Eight in 1995. After a poor run of results, he realised that the problem was not skill or tactics, but the players' desire for Wenger, the master-coach, to give them more instructions: they wanted to be told what to do every time they had the ball. 'Football is not American football, where the coach can give instructions for each play over headphones,' Wenger wrote afterwards. So, instead of giving them orders, he gave them choices. 'I did not tell them, \"When you're in this situation, pass to this player\". I knew it would take a long time to produce results, but there was no other way.' It worked. Grampus came second in the league and won the Emperor's Cup, their first trophy. Japanese instinct is to focus on details and technique. Japanese sports tabloids write little about the mood of a game, and instead print reams of statistics and reproduce goals using diagrams with straight, squiggly and dotted lines to show dribbles, off-the-ball runs and through-passes. A television commentator in one recent international noticed that a lot of passes were falling short 'even though the length of the grass has been reduced from 25 millimetres to 22'. Concentrating on the details can mean forgetting the object of a match. According to Gert Engels, a German who has coached in Japan for more than a decade and manages Kyoto Purple Sanga: 'The Japanese don't just want to win; they want to win smoothly, using the right method, with intelligence, technique and tactics. One thing all foreign coaches notice is that when a group of players are playing a mini-game, they don't know the score.' These instincts only get in the way when pursuing what has become the Holy Grail of Japanese sport: making it abroad. Many have tried, but few so far have succeeded. Three Japanese players joined English clubs last season: Akinori Nishizawa (Bolton Wanderers), Junichi Inamoto (Arsenal) and Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi (Portsmouth). Of the three, only Kawaguchi played any league games - and Portsmouth quickly drafted a replacement after he let in too many goals. Two have been a success, both attacking midfielders. One is Shinji Ono, who gained a regular place at Uefa Cup winners Feyenoord in Holland this season. The most famous is Hidetoshi Nakata, of Parma in Italy, and the biggest reason for his success is, surprisingly, mental toughness. In Japan he became famous for refusing to add the polite ' san' to the names of older players. Such niceties were, he thought, a distraction from the task of winning. While most Japanese spend a good part of their lives doing what they are told and worrying what other people think of them, Nakata once said: 'Regardless of what other people say, if you think you are right, you should do as you think best. The important thing is to have a strong sense of self.' Japan's emphasis on international success threatens to drown out the local game. Young Japanese who might support their local clubs often prefer instead to watch European football on satellite TV and debate the merits of the English, German and Italian games. Kick-around games feature an array of international replica shirts, but almost never one of a J.League team. None of this matters at the Reds. Noisy, enthusiastic crowds of between 20,000 and 30,000 regularly assemble at their new home ground, Saitama Stadium - venue for England's game against Sweden today. A few others have well-established support bases too, such as Kashima Antlers, the Zico-inspired team who have won the championship four times. But even in J1, the first division, some clubs are failing to pull in crowds. In April, fewer than 6,000 turned up to see Inamoto's old club, Gamba Osaka, play JEF Ichihara. Japan's overseas football bug is great for its role as a World Cup host. The Japanese are dying to see a top foreign star - just look at the welcome for David Beckham and Michael Owen - and their national team's matches will likely break TV viewing records. But if Japan screw up, it could spell doom for their domestic game. J.League attendances plum meted after Japan lost all three games in France, their first World Cup, leading to financial crisis at many clubs. This time, Japan's minimum requirement is to get through to the knockout stage. The players know the destiny of the game in Japan probably hinges on the results of their next three matches, starting with Belgium on Tuesday. If that doesn't create a desire to win, nothing will. \u00b7 Sebastian Moffett is the author of Japanese Rules: Why the Japanese needed football and how they got it (Yellow Jersey, \u00a310)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
