A fine individual display from Bevan French laid the platform for Wigan to emerge victorious from what started out as a tight game, but for Toronto the three new injuries they suffered will be most concerning. The new season is not even a month old but the pre-season predictions from many experts that Toronto\u2019s wafer-thin squad would cause them problems are already proving well-founded. They arrived here with only 18 fit players and by the end were devoid of Jon Wilkin, James Cunningham and Gadwin Springer. Toronto are certainly getting better game by game, but there are bigger issues for them to contend with in the near future: the club are still in dispute with Super League over salary cap dispensation in order to add to their 23-man squad. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for each other and we\u2019re improving,\u201d McDermott said after this tough defeat. With the hour-mark approaching, Toronto had battled to level the game at 10-10, and were good value for that, thanks to tries in each half from Matty Russell and Bodene Thompson. But Wigan \u2013 and particularly French \u2013 are a joy to watch when they click. They had their erratic moments here, but when they hit full-speed they were too hot for Toronto to handle. The four tries they scored in the final quarter underlined that. French\u2019s second, and a long-range try by Joe Burgess at the end of a move started by Wigan\u2019s flying Australian full-back, took the game away from Toronto before a late double for Liam Farrell added an unfair slant to the scoreline. \u201cHe\u2019s exciting, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Wigan\u2019s coach, Adrian Lam, said of French afterwards. \u201cWe had some conversations during the week and he\u2019s got some work to do, but when he works that out he\u2019s going to be even better.\u201d After Russell\u2019s early score put Toronto ahead, Wigan soon warmed to the task. A fine individual try from the teenage half-back Harry Smith was followed by French\u2019s first of the night, putting Wigan 10-4 ahead at half-time. Much to their credit, Toronto responded well after the break and looked capable of an upset when Thompson crossed to level the scores. However, their injury issues, pre-game and during it, would eventually catch up with them and Wigan took full advantage. French sparked a move that led to Burgess putting the Warriors ahead again, and from there they wouldn\u2019t hold back. French\u2019s second try and Farrell\u2019s double-salvo deepened Toronto\u2019s pain.
