Even so Phillip Hughes' first innings for Australia in an Ashes contest was compulsive viewing. Now that the series has started, the scrutiny becomes ever more intense, the head-shaking ever more vigorous. No one could remember a Test opening batsman playing like this. The ridiculous thing is that Hughes gets into positions that bear comparison with those adopted by Jimmy Anderson in the morning session. He stays inside the line of the ball so that he can biff it through the off-side. There are some differences. Anderson may never have been dismissed for a duck in Test cricket (Hughes was in his first innings) but he props up the tail and averages 13 with the bat. Hughes faces the new ball for a living and averages 69 in his brief Test career. \"He's backing away\", noted one or two startled and vastly experienced observers (when Hughes rather than Anderson was on strike). True, he was backing away, but this description is an emotive phrase in cricketing circles. The implication in any dressing room is that \"backing away\" implies timidity, a reluctance to be hit, a touch of cowardice. But this certainly does not apply to Hughes. So we had better replace \"backing away\" with the less charged description, \"giving himself room\". Hughes disobeys most of the openers' rules. They are supposed to minimise risk at the start of an innings. The most common way to be dismissed against a new, hard ball is from an outside edge. So the received wisdom is to be wary outside the off stump, to make the bowlers come to you and then to clip them away on the leg-side. An inside edge usually goes nowhere; the outside edge is perilous. But Hughes does it the other way round. His back foot stays on leg stump and his eye is so good that he can hit anything slightly wide of off stump in an arc between extra cover and third man. It is tough for fielding captains to defend those areas square of the wicket. Nervelessly, Hughes came out after the mayhem of the morning and launched Australia's reply. By lunch he had 28 from 30 balls with four boundaries (no prizes for guessing where they went). But after the break we had a duel, the first serious one of the series. Andrew Flintoff started with a bouncer. And he had a word. Next ball, another bouncer and Hughes ducked, but as he regained his balance he held his pose, theatrically staring back down at the bowler. Here were shades of Derek Randall being bounced by Dennis Lillee in the Centenary Test \u2013 though Randall doffed his cap at an aghast bowler; it's hard to doff a helmet. More bouncers from around the wicket. Hughes was uncomfortable and a little frenetic. He managed one scythed boundary through the slip cordon after lunch but Flintoff was up around 94 mph. Then Flintoff tried bowling over the wicket. Hughes could not decide whether to play with a vertical bat or a horizontal one (the sages say he has to be made to play vertically \u2013 a different way of saying that he must be given no width) and he ended up with a flustered attempt that was somewhere between the two. An inside edge was clasped by the wicketkeeper. Round one to Flintoff and England and the debate began. Can Hughes get away with playing like he does at the highest level? Should he adjust his method? We have to wait for the answer to the first question; the answer to the second is surely \"No\". Hughes has made his way to the top, staying on leg stump and exploring the off-side. It looks cumbersome on occasions; it offends the purists. There will be some ugly dismissals. But in the recent past against a quality attack in South Africa there was a stream of boundaries as well. England would be winning the duel if they spied Hughes moving back and across the next time he comes to the crease. Such a change to Hughes's technique would also remove an intriguing contrast in the Australian opening pair. Bowl the identical delivery to Hughes and Simon Katich and the ball will probably end up on different sides of the pitch. A straight delivery to Hughes is liable to end up at cover point, to Katich and it usually goes towards square leg. Hughes plays from leg stump. Katich, who was serene throughout yesterday, delivering the traditional opener's innings, steps to the off-side as the bowler delivers the ball and plays from off stump. No flirtations to excite the slip cordon for him until he has been batting for a couple of hours. Come over to my side, the leg-side. Katich was wonderfully methodical and risk-free. England and all their pundits have expended much energy and attention on how to dismiss Hughes and many theories abound. Maybe now they should turn their minds to the unspectacular Katich, twice the player we saw in 2005."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
