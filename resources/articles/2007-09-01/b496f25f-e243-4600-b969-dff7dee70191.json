Beat the All Blacks in the Tri-Nations, but rely on a number of players whose best days are on video. Betamax, in George Gregan's case. How they see it Being Australian, they are talking about having won every European World Cup. Meaning two. The coach John Connolly took over 18 months ago and brought about improvement while cooking up an entertaining spat with his predecessor, Eddie Jones, who is now with South Africa.
