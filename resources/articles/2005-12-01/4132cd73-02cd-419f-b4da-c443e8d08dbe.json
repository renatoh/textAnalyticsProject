Shane Warne thinks they will need him; and, if the last fortnight of talk is anything to go by, he may well be right. Not for some time have the airwaves around a touring team in Australia crackled with so much propaganda. Smith has publicly targeted the Australian top three, Herschelle Gibbs and Andre Nel have professed relish for the four-letter game, and their erstwhile comrade Pat Symcox has prophesied \"payback time\" for South Africans at Warne's expense. For the press conferences during the first Test beginning in Perth today, however, Smith may have to consider wearing a helmet, so utterly has his team been written off after suffering an innings defeat at the hands of Western Australia. The International Cricket Council's chief executive Malcolm Speed has taken the quaint step of urging players to desist from their \"war of words\", perhaps foreshadowing an official ICC code of clich\u00e9. If Muhammad Ali was reincarnated as a cricketer, he'd scarcely get out the gate; \"This might shock and amaze ya/But I'm going to re-tire Joe Frazier\" alone would be worth a six-match suspension at least. Something is certainly needed to spice up summer, after three abjectly dull Tests against West Indies in which Cricket Australia scarcely had to think about dusting the Frank Worrell Trophy let alone removing it from its glass case. Already, in fact, there is a lot about this summer to remind one of previous seasons. Ricky Ponting's team has extended Australia's record on home soil since its last series defeat here to 53 Tests interspersed by only eight defeats, and ensured there would be no shortage of tacky metal objects vaguely resembling stumps by retaining the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy in New Zealand last week. All of which has made the part of their trophy cabinet occupied until September by the Ashes crystalware the more puzzling, even embarrassing. Since traipsing off at Trent Bridge to the sound of his own feet, for instance, Matthew Hayden has bludgeoned 771 runs at 96.37. It is like a sequel to Jack and the Beanstalk in which the giant picks himself up, dusts himself off and says: \"Lucky I landed on this voluminous goosedown quilt draped over a mountain of mattresses. Now, where's that sodding treasure?\" England's unexpected confiscation of the trophy has truncated a few careers, notably those of Michael Clarke and Simon Katich, and kicked along a few others, like Brad Hodge, Andrew Symonds and Michael Hussey. The 30-year-old Hussey has been the revelation this summer. First as stand-in opener, then as middle-order counter-puncher, he has accumulated an average of 120.33 in his first half-dozen Test innings. The depth of Australian feeling about the Ashes and omens for the rematch in 2006-7 has also, however, been this summer's back story; a back story more interesting for most of the time, in fact, than what has been out front. Far-sighted English tourists thinking ahead to the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne next Christmas, for example, seem to have booked out even the mangers. Last week in Canberra, on a less congenial note, the Australian Institute of Sport announced that it would be withdrawing the welcome mat traditionally lain before foreign athletes and officials. The director Peter Fricker pinned the blame somewhere countrymen could understand it: on those pesky foreign countries now disinclined to simply roll over. \"We have lost the Ashes in England, we have been beaten by New Zealand in rugby and rowing and netball,\" he complained. \"The rest of the world is now doing really well what we have been doing for the past 25 years. In the 1990s, countries started to take an interest in what we were doing and came to see us and we gave everything away. We gave them in 20 minutes what we had spent 20 years developing.\" But another side story in the same vein last week was that of the imminent repatriation of Troy Cooley, the Tasmanian who put the punch into England's pace attack last summer. He joins John Buchanan's coaching staff in May, now also augmented by a performance analyst, the former academy coach Richard McInnes. More changes can be expected in the Australian set-up as time ticks away to the Ashes of 2006-7. And while a lot of talk surrounds Australia's confrontation with South Africa, murmurs about next summer are already well and truly audible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
