Austin James Wilkerson, a 22-year-old former University of Colorado student, was convicted of sexually assaulting a \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201chalf-conscious\u201d first-year student after he told friends he would take care of her. Prosecutors say Wilkerson repeatedly tried to cover up the crime and lied under oath about the full extent of the assault against the vulnerable woman. Despite the guilty verdict by a jury, Judge Patrick Butler decided not to send Wilkerson to prison this week with a ruling that closely resembles the lenient sentencing of former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner. In a statement to the Guardian on Thursday, the victim said that she was motivated to share her story and impact statement after seeing other survivors of sexual assault come forward: \u201cAlthough I did have to re-live the trauma multiple times, I would go through this process all over again. Our goal has been to have the rapist not perpetrate again, which hopefully won\u2019t happen even with the light sentence. We get to put a face to the 1-in-4 statistics. Surprisingly, this whole ordeal has been therapeutic. I get to tell my story and not keep it bottled up.\u201d She continued, \u201cOther brave survivors\u2019 eerily familiar stories have inspired me to share my story that rape isn\u2019t always a stranger in the bushes.\u201d Here is the 21-year-old woman\u2019s full statement to the court: \u201cHis life is ruined.\u201d Oh yeah, and it\u2019s not like my life isn\u2019t ruined or anything. It\u2019s always been about the rapist since the assault. As the victim of this sexual assault, my life has been ruined socially, psychologically, academically, and financially. To begin with, this sexual assault has ruined me socially. I don\u2019t go to CU football games anymore. I don\u2019t drink at parties anymore. I don\u2019t even go out anymore. This is partially because I\u2019m too scared to be in situations that remind me of the sexual assault. But it\u2019s also in part because of all the victim-blaming that I have internalized. Instead of having the typical fun 21st birthday celebration, I was saying that I couldn\u2019t go to the bars with everyone because I had too much homework. In reality, I was too scared of my friends\u2019 friends because the rapist was a friend of a friend. Another instance of being afraid of my friends\u2019 friends was my living situation for the 2015-2016 school year. My friend and I were going to live with our group of friends. However, during the contract negotiation, my supposed friends sprung a new roommate on us. I was fine with this for the most part, until my \u201cfriends\u201d had the new roommate share a bathroom and floor with us girls. These were not the terms I consented to. Everyone thought I was being irrational for not wanting to share a bathroom and be on the same floor level as their friend, who was a guy I had met only twice. I feel like those dogs who become afraid or don\u2019t like being around certain people. In my case, I\u2019m afraid of acquaintances, since this sexual assault was an acquaintance rape. Safety is my #1 priority, even if it means jeopardizing relationships. \u201cOh boo hoo,\u201d you might say. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to go out and party and have fun. Big deal.\u201d But it\u2019s not just socially, it\u2019s psychologically. It\u2019s the anxiety. When I started filing this sexual assault case with CU back in the fall of 2014, I had a horrible nightmare that the rapist was going to retaliate against me. He was going to kill me with a bomb. I tried to tell the authorities, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. I woke up from this nightmare crying. I immediately called my mom and told her I couldn\u2019t go to class because the rapist was on campus. She reassured me that he wouldn\u2019t retaliate against me because there would be consequences. I reluctantly agreed to go to class, but in the back of my mind I thought about how the rapist had committed this horrific crime knowing that there would be consequences. So what would stop him from retaliating? On campus I was on high alert, constantly checking over my shoulder. Keep in mind that CU didn\u2019t have a Criminal Protection Order. All CU said was that if we crossed paths, he would have to turn and go the other way. However, this didn\u2019t happen. After the trial conviction, the rapist was in the waiting area. Instead of him turning around and going the other way \u2013 like everyone had reassured me he would do \u2013 the rapist stayed there. I was the one who was going the other way. The flight part of my fight-or-flight instincts kicked into overdrive. I practically ran the other way so I wouldn\u2019t have to be anywhere near him. Even with the Criminal Protection Order and the court not allowing weapons, I did not feel safe around the rapist. And I never will. When I\u2019m not having nightmares of rape, retaliation, or retrial that goes awry, I\u2019m having panic attacks. Like the nightmares, these started after the sexual assault. Prior to the assault, I never had a panic attack in my life. At first, I thought these panic attacks were random, but the more of them I had, the more a pattern emerged that aligned with the sexual assault: I would be peacefully sleeping when all of the sudden I would be jolted awake by this horrible thing happening to me. There wasn\u2019t much I could do except try to breathe through it \u2013 just try to survive \u2013 and wait for the horrible thing to be over with. Just. Like. The assault. One of the most vivid panic attacks I remember was again when I was filing this sexual assault case with CU in the fall of 2014. I was peacefully sleeping. Then I woke up to the horrible feeling that I was dying. I was so scared and confused that it felt like I was going crazy; it didn\u2019t feel real. When I could actually sit up and move \u2013 not frozen lying down \u2013 I asked my roommate to take me to the hospital. Of course once I got to the hospital they told me everything was fine. After going to the hospital another time, my parents told me that I had to stop going to the hospital. If something was wrong, I was to call my mom because she is a medical doctor and would be able to help. In the spring of 2015 I had yet another panic attack. I was peacefully sleeping when I was jolted awake. This time it felt like I was having a heart attack. It was a sharp, jabbing attack on my heart. About half an hour later it passed but I was still shaken. Instead of going to the hospital, I called my mom at four or five in the morning crying. Between uncontrollable sobs I told her that I had just had a heart attack. I told her my symptoms and she told me that the symptoms were not that of a heart attack. Even after her reassurance, I couldn\u2019t fall back asleep; I was too afraid to wake up to the horrible thing again. It\u2019s the depression. About a month after the assault, I tried to kill myself because of the impact of the sexual assault. Some days I can\u2019t even get out of bed, let alone do four readings, projects, and study for tests. And no wonder. The rapist made pleasurable things of sex, sleep, and going out traumatic. So it\u2019s no surprise that less pleasurable things like studying are 100 times more difficult. It really was a snowball effect: the rape affected me socially and psychologically, which in turn affected me academically. Every time I would try to put this trauma out of my mind, I would be reminded of it again and again with new updates, hearing dates, and trial dates. Like, \u201cHey, remember that traumatic thing that happened to you? Yeah you\u2019re gonna have to relive that in your retelling to CU-Boulder investigators; the DA\u2019s office; a detective; your therapist; your psychologist; your psychiatrist; your Office of Victim Assistance counselor; a judge; a jury; the rapist\u2019s family, affiliates, and legal team; your loved ones; and many others! Hope that doesn\u2019t put a damper on your school thing!\u201d Everything is a reminder. I can\u2019t escape the rapist figuratively or literally. For example, earlier this year my team and I went to New Mexico for a tournament. Back in Colorado, I returned to the unsettling news that the rapist was going to New Mexico the weekend after I went. What if he was there when I was? Would he supposedly turn around and go the other way? We\u2019ve seen how well that has worked\u2026 Finally, financially. $250,000. $127,582 lost of future wages because I\u2019ll still be in school instead of working. Lower starting income because I\u2019ll only have an undergraduate degree instead of a master\u2019s degree: $14,698. Hospital bills from panic attacks: $5,000. Bills for antidepressants: $100. MESA trauma class: $90. Money spent on textbooks and material for failed and withdrawn classes: $10,000. Money lost on failed and withdrawn classes: $15,000. Money lost on having to do extra undergraduate years (which includes housing and living expenses): $20,000. Bills from suicide attempt resulting in MIP, hospitalization, and BASICS classes: $4,000. $52,900 for my parents\u2019 time, my time, and gas spent for meetings and trial. The $250,000 doesn\u2019t even include a lifetime of future expenses of therapy, antidepressants, etc. as a result of this sexual assault. But it\u2019s only the rapist\u2019s life that has been ruined, right? It\u2019s not like I had hopes and dreams or academic and career goals. But worst of all is the victim-blaming. Freshman year, one of my roommates, who you met at trial, was victim-blaming. At the end of April 2014, our floor was talking about how we saw this girl throwing up outside of our Williams Village dorm, Darley North. A few days after that, we received an email saying that a girl had reported a rape to the police. The rape was perpetrated after a party in a WillVill dorm by someone she knew. Some people on our floor speculated that maybe the girl we saw throwing up outside our dorm was the one who was raped. My roommate chimed in, \u201cWell, if she was that drunk, then she deserved to get raped.\u201d I was livid and vehemently defended the victim, and this was before I had even processed the sexual assault perpetrated against me. But my roommate wasn\u2019t the only one who was victim-blaming; it was a person (or persons) in the jury. Following my breaking down and crying and getting ridiculed about the sexual assault, someone in the jury had the audacity to ask me why I didn\u2019t say, \u201cNo.\u201d The real question is, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the rapist get my consent?!\u201d It would be like if someone robbed you and they said, \u201cWell you didn\u2019t say no!\u201d Does a lack of a \u201cno\u201d make the robbery okay? Of course not! Even my own mother was victim-blaming. She told me that if I hadn\u2019t been drunk, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. Yet, it was excusable for him to rape me because he was drunk. After all I\u2019ve endured emotionally, physically, psychologically, and financially, the burden of the blame still crashes down on my shoulders. Therefore, it\u2019s my contention that the maximum sentence would be the most suitable. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about running into the rapist at CU football games or on campus or even in New Mexico. The best reassurance \u2013 not CU\u2019s, \u201cOh he\u2019ll just go the other way!\u201d \u2013 would be to know that the rapist cannot physically get to me. Please don\u2019t be like CU\u2019s director of student conduct, who had total disregard for my safety and the safety of others by allowing the rapist to go to an on-campus comedy show after he was found guilty of multiple counts of sexual assault. Please don\u2019t be like CU\u2019s director of student conduct, who suspended the rapist from CU for just over a year, meaning that he would be allowed back on campus while I was still attending. Basically, please don\u2019t be like CU\u2019s director of student conduct, who sacrificed the safety of the community in favor of the rapist\u2019s pleasure. Knowing that the rapist cannot physically get to anyone would give the community and me a peace of mind \u2013 well, at least for a little while out of my lifelong suffering. Have as much mercy for the rapist as he did for me the night of the sexual assault, which was none. In conclusion, the rapist CHOSE to ruin his life. But like the sexual assault itself, my life has been ruined without my consent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
