The Ibrox club were reported to Uefa by delegates after a window was broken on Villarreal's team bus in Spain as it made its way to the second-leg match, and Rangers' fans were accused of sectarian chanting during both fixtures. Rangers will not be represented at the lunchtime hearing in Nyon, but have submitted a dossier to Uefa which is understood to include evidence of their anti-sectarian initiatives. If found guilty, the Glasgow club are likely to be fined but Uefa has already warned that recidivism - counted as repeated offending within five years of an original offence - counts as an aggravating circumstance and Rangers would then risk having part or all of Ibrox closed for European matches if the offence occurs again. Today's events will also be closely scrutinised by Celtic and Hearts, who will be in Europe next season. The clubs realise that if elements of their support engage in sectarian chants at matches they might fall foul of Uefa clampdown on racism and bigotry. \"We accept we have our own issues, particularly with a section of our away support, and we will continue to tackle this,\" said Celtic's chief executive Peter Lawwell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
