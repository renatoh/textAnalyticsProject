The raging hormones, the mood swings, the sullenness, the illicit sex and the furtive phone calls that fall silent when you're within earshot. And that's just Dad. Of course, in past generations, the void between youth and middle age was clearly defined. Fathers spent Saturdays waxing the car or mowing the lawn, and mothers wore aprons and took tranquillisers. Meanwhile, kids took illegal substances, were obnoxious and had spots. But now Dad (who would rather be called by his Christian name), has done rehab, lost his licence and expects his teenager to drive him around. Mum, on her third lover, goes clubbing and is obsessed with her skin. Teenagers are being squeezed out of their territory. Adolescence was designed to separate the men from the boys, but given that parents act like kids with more money, the only thing left for the adolescent to do is stop speaking and nick your stuff. So no matter how cool a parent you think you are, your child will not speak except to ask for money or to tell you to fuck off. The phone will be engaged. Your drink, drugs and deodorant will vanish and your new shoes and designer shirt will be borrowed, trashed and left on a heap on the floor. And they will have better sex than you - more often. \u00b7 A is also for abortion, acne, alcohol, amphetamine, angst, attitude, awkward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
