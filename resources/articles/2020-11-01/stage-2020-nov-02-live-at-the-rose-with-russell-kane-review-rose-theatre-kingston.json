On Saturday, the government said it had to close again. Such is the grim reality of UK theatre life in 2020. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting this to be our last night out for a while,\u201d says host Angela Barnes at this first edition of standup night Live at the Rose. And so the evening takes on an elegiac air, a bittersweet last laugh before the hatches of gloom are battened down once more. Not that there\u2019s anything elegiac about headliner Russell Kane\u2019s turn, a barnstorming 40 minutes entirely about Covid. You spend your days reeling at what we\u2019ve lost to the pandemic, and at the magnitude of the government\u2019s incompetence in the face of it \u2013 and Kane\u2019s is the first comic response to honour the extremity of that on stage. Maybe it\u2019s that, in this fatal global virus, his hyperactive, raw-nerve style has finally met its match. He\u2019s buzzing around like a mosquito from the off, miming the handshakes he\u2019s exchanged with people who\u2019re \u201ctoo cool for the pandemic\u201d, then the furious surreptitious sanitising straight after. The new behaviours Covid has ushered in supply much of Kane\u2019s material here. But it\u2019s a political as well as observational set, cathartically deploring our hopeless PM and the endless contradictions that pass for his Covid policy. The latter are drolly sent up as cartoonish Kane hymns the rigorous science behind, say, reducing two-metre distancing to \u201cone metre plus\u201d. There\u2019s also a tragicomic cri de coeur about the pride before a fall Kane once felt as a prosperous freelance artist, and a fine routine about dating under tier-four restrictions. It\u2019s blistering stuff, fuelled not only by dismay at what we\u2019re living through but by love for what we\u2019ve lost and a fierce refusal to normalise this \u201cnew normal\u201d. There\u2019s little that Barnes or Nathan Caton in the support slots can do to measure up. The latter delivers reliable relationship comedy about his girlfriend\u2019s domestic habits, and I liked Barnes\u2019s riposte to those who advance Theresa May\u2019s feminist credentials. But this is Kane\u2019s evening, with the best set I\u2019ve seen yet on Covid-19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
