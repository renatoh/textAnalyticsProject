Fabregas, who was criticised heavily by Ipswich and Huddersfield Town players for his behaviour during and after recent cup ties, and his team-mates reacted furiously to Louis Saha's 24th minute reward with the Frenchman appearing to be offside when Seamus Coleman clipped his pass over Arsenal's back-line. Laurent Koscielny's deliberate touch played the ball into the striker's path, with the goal allowed to stand after Mason consulted his linesman, Stephen Child. \"Fabregas' comments to the referee and the fourth official at half-time coming down the tunnel warranted a sending off,\" said Moyes. \"I'm not going to repeat them, but they were disappointing comments from such a talented footballer. They weren't about our players, but they were deserving of a sending off, 100%. If he'd said them on the pitch he would have been off like that. Why should it be any different in the tunnel? \"He's a big player for them. I think it changed the flow of the game, but I'm not going to repeat what he said. I'll let them tell you what he said. But the decision for the goal seemed to change a lot of things in the game.\" Arsene Wenger denied his captain had confronted the officials as the players exited for half-time. \"I talked to the referee and that was in a polite and calm way, you can ask the referee,\" he said. \"He didn't speak to the referee, Cesc Fabregas, at half-time; I spoke to the referee. If you have the film, you can check. I spoke to the referee.\" Both managers did agree that Saha's goal should have been ruled out for offside - the modern interpretation of offside actually suggests the linesman's decision was correct - though Arsene Wenger drew huge encouragement from his side's second half recovery, which has maintained their title challenge. His only concerns were injuries picked up by Theo Walcott (ankle) and Alex Song (leg), with both players to be assessed today. \"This was a victory for a team with fantastic spirit and a never say die attitude rather than a team playing our usual game, but that is needed in this championship,\" added Wenger, who expects to be without Samir Nasri for 21 days with a hamstring strain. \"I'm very happy because the spirit is maybe the aspect of this team that's been questioned the most, and that's where we've been the most convincing recently.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
