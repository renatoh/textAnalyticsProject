Two dads who have known each other since they were 11 \u2013 they\u2019re now 39 \u2013 are having lunch without the kids. One is a smiling, broad-shouldered bear in a pink T-shirt. The other is smaller and bespectacled, hiding under a baseball cap. They look slightly hipsterish, but blend into the background seamlessly. A huge yellow bag and rucksack under the table contain their rather different outfits for later that day. Five hours later, Alexis Taylor is in front of thousands at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park, Hackney, his cap removed to reveal rainbow-coloured hair, a DayGlo lifejacket with holes around the nipples swaddling his body. Joe Goddard, meanwhile, is rocking back and forth behind a bank of synthesisers, wearing a colourful jacket with a pattern by artist Jeremy Deller (also unfolded from the dad bags). Joining them are the rest of their crazily dressed band: guitarist Al Doyle in a linen tunic and trousers like a latterday apostle, brightly clothed multi-instrumentalist Owen Clarke, and synthesiser player Felix Martin smiling under his mop of madcap curls. Rob Smoughton (bass, congas, silvery beard, straw boater) and Leo Taylor (drums, lime-green top with pagan symbols) complete the live line-up. Behold Hot Chip, the greatest British pop group of their generation. They look like cartoon characters, and for their devoted fanbase, that\u2019s where their appeal begins. The band\u2019s music and image suggests a poppier, ravier version of Talking Heads. Gloriously ordinary weirdos, essentially, projecting their most extravagant selves on stage and video. Their fashion is the 21st-century equivalent of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Japanese jackets and Boy caps, and they have an art-school archness that is easy to appreciate, as their songs are never too serious, their live sets infused with humour. Their best songs, from 2006\u2019s Boy from School to 2010\u2019s One Life Stand to their stunning new single, Melody of Love, undercut playfulness with a heart-tugging melancholy. Taylor\u2019s voice \u2013 a high, pure peal in the tradition of Paul Heaton, Neil Tennant and Belle and Sebastian\u2019s Stuart Murdoch \u2013 is the heart, while Goddard\u2019s electronic wizardry provides their guts and pulse. Hot Chip are a strange modern success story: they\u2019ve become festival headliners while only ever having three top 40 hits. Since 2006\u2019s The Warning, their breakthrough second album, tracks such as Over and Over (with its earwormy refrain: \u201clike a monkey with a miniature cymbal\u201d) have become ingrained in our pop consciousness, boosted by regular TV and soundtrack deals. Hot Chip\u2019s reputation as a brilliant live band has also helped, their music uniting old ravers and young (their top billing slot at 2015\u2019s Green Man was glorious; this year they headline Glastonbury\u2019s Park stage and the electronic Bluedot festival). And they only get better. On 21 June, they will release their best, most commercial album yet: the provocatively titled A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The summer solstice release date is no coincidence: the typographic design and psychedelic colours of the cover art by Jeremy Deller and graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge (adapted into the band\u2019s stagewear by Cardiff designer Demi Amber) suggests pagan rituals and the early days of rave. It\u2019s all a long way from the south London schoolyard where Taylor and Goddard first met in 1991... \u201cThe first pop culture we bonded over? Honestly? Football and WWF wrestling!\u201d Joe Goddard is great company: funny, interested, polite. Taylor is much quieter, but curiosity and warmth bubble through his conversation. The boys met at the now famous \u201cpop comp\u201d, Putney\u2019s Elliott school, whose other notable alumni include Burial, the xx and Four Tet\u2019s Kieran Hebden, one of their early mentors (Goddard once got Hebden\u2019s university email disabled after sending him \u201cenormous sound files\u201d). The friends\u2019 first musical bonding moment was Beastie Boys, whom they watched on The Word (\u201cthey were incredibly charismatic and silly and fantastical, and that\u2019s what we wanted to be\u201d). Later, they got into alternative American singer-songwriters such as Smog\u2019s Bill Callahan, Jim O\u2019Rourke and Will Oldham, who remains a big influence on Taylor. \u201cHe\u2019s so interesting and contrary, a great lyricist, and so prolific. It\u2019s funny: the music industry these days almost trains people to offer less stuff. I like challenging that.\u201d Their interest in pop culture was helped by their parents being arty, curious types. Taylor\u2019s father was a university English professor, his Greek mum a psychoanalyst (they divorced when he was young). Goddard\u2019s father was a film editor in Soho, which fascinated Joe, and Hot Chip\u2019s adventurous videos, such as the recent eight-minute short film for Hungry Child in which a couple get possessed by the song, suggest a continuing interest. Goddard\u2019s parents would throw open their basement to their son\u2019s friends, including Clarke, on weekends, and after playing football on nearby fields, they\u2019d convene to learn songs, play guitars and use \u201creally rubbish, rudimentary\u201d computer programs to take loops off CDs. Then, in 1999, the pair went to university \u2013 Taylor to Cambridge to study English, Goddard to Oxford to study history \u2013 but their resolve to make music together set in. \u201cEverything was changing quite quickly at that point,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cJoe was getting into house and UK garage, I was listening constantly to Destiny\u2019s Child, but we still travelled to be together often and started trying to do our own weird take on the music that we liked.\u201d Hot Chip\u2019s first EP, Mexico, was released in 2001, \u201coutselling Eric Clapton\u2019s new release in Cambridge\u2019s Parrot Records on the day it came out,\u201d Taylor says, proudly. Another EP, Sanfrandisco, followed in October 2002, after the friends had graduated. By this point, Goddard was a marketing assistant at Island Records (\u201cI worked on the first Keane album!\u201d), and soon after heard the EP playing in the office of A&amp;R Stephen Bass, who also ran indie label Moshi Moshi. In 2004, Bass released their first album, Coming on Strong. By the time of its follow-up, The Warning, Hot Chip had signed to EMI and were everywhere: popping up on TV background tracks, getting a Mercury nomination and being sent on huge tours. \u201cWe were a sales priority! Not that that lasted,\u201d says Goddard. \u201cWe went on this semi-amazing, semi-crazy trip across Spain and Portugal, being shipped from festival to festival in this coach in boiling heat \u2013 but the air conditioning was broken. We were all, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re the new music business thing, guys!\u201d 2008\u2019s Ready for the Floor remains their only Top 10 single (No 6). \u201cI loved that moment,\u201d Taylor says. Does he mind not having had any more? \u201cIt\u2019d be nice, but it\u2019s not that I\u2019m studying the charts, desperate to get in.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about this without sounding ancient and miserable but the best pop, in my mind, is imaginative, immediate and accessible \u2013 but also challenging. I hate the amount of bland pop music around now. In our early days, Timbaland and Neptunes were producing big hits in really interesting ways. There\u2019s hardly anybody doing that now.\u201d After EMI collapsed in 2012, Hot Chip left the majors to sign to Domino, a label where Taylor had worked in his university holidays, doing admin. \u201cThey let us be who we want to be, and do what we want to do,\u201d he says. This has included them doing lots of extracurricular music in the last decade: Taylor\u2019s jazz improv four-piece, About Group, and his and Goddard\u2019s solo albums have come out on the label too. Taylor was also one of the first signatories on the letter to save Radio 3\u2019s experimental programme Late Junction earlier this year. \u201cAn institution like that having platforms for interesting, diverse music is really important,\u201d he continues, \u201cwhether it\u2019s Late Junction, Later With Jools Holland, or the Maida Vale sessions. It underlines that creativity is worth paying attention to.\u201d The spirit of collaboration with others has changed them, they say \u2013 and it\u2019s the same for Al Doyle, who joined LCD Soundsystem live in 2007, before co-writing seven tracks on their 2017 album, American Dream (\u201cAl\u2019s in James Murphy\u2019s classy world now,\u201d Goddard smiles). Taylor\u2019s 2017 Listen With(out) Piano project also saw him giving songs over completely to other people to finish, among them Green Gartside and Royal Trux\u2019s Jennifer Herrema. When Hot Chip came back together, he knew a similar approach would enliven them. So instead of producing themselves, as they always did, they got in Philippe Zdar, of French dance duo Cassius, who went wild on the psychedelic effects (\u201cHe\u2019s got a bottle of acid in his fridge, actually,\u201d Goddard says). Xx producer Rodaidh McDonald was harsher. He pushed them to rewrite lyrics and edit song ideas drastically. \u201cWe signed up for it, though, so that\u2019s OK,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s thanks to him that Melody of Love is a big pop single rather than a 12-minute instrumental.\u201d He loved that idea of \u201cconnecting to people\u201d, he says. Live is equally meaningful for the band. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that we come to life on stage: being upbeat, not too subtle, and I love to see people\u2019s reactions if that\u2019s possible,\u201d adds Taylor. But other things have changed Hot Chip\u2019s approach to making music in recent years. One was having kids, which they did relatively young (Taylor was married in his early 20s and his daughter, Prudence, is 10; Goddard\u2019s daughter, Edie, is eight, his son, Albert, seven). \u201cParenthood teaches you a lot about your ego,\u201d says Goddard. \u201cHaving a sense of self-importance is crucial if you\u2019re in a band \u2013 that your ideas are important and need to be sung to people. Having kids battles that, makes you focus, and also makes time much more precious, which is a really wonderful thing. You can\u2019t have this wonderful spontaneous lifestyle of just being able to read the newspaper in a cafe for three hours on a Saturday morning any more. Instead, you\u2019re rocking your daughter because she will cry if she\u2019s put down, and you\u2019re thinking of the bassline and the beat you\u2019re going to work on. And when you do it, you make it special.\u201d But tragic events have affected them too, several around the release of 2015\u2019s Why Make Sense?. Schoolfriend and longtime collaborator Vincent Sipprell, a violinist, killed himself in January 2015; Taylor has said that the loss deeply influenced that record. Then, on 18 November, the band were due to play in Paris. Five days before, 90 people were killed at the Bataclan. The band had played there previously; they knew people directly affected by friends dying. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t want to do our gig if it seemed like the wrong message,\u201d Goddard says. But they played, and Al Doyle read a statement at the start of the gig that he had written in French. \u201cHe said that it\u2019s incredible how just playing a show becomes a political act after something like that happens. People thanked us for helping them to be able to be together as a group of people, enjoying something that they wanted to enjoy.\u201d He sits quietly for a moment. \u201cYou could see from the stage people who were dancing but also in tears. It was an incredibly moving experience, to be honest.\u201d With that in mind, A Bath Full of Ecstasy feels like a record for our terrifying times. It takes the communal spirit of house and splices it with the DNA of pop: music as a conduit of hope. The band\u2019s image in 2019 \u2013 all sugary pastels and pure joy \u2013 is wrapped up in that feeling. We\u2019ve moved to a photo studio next door by this point, where the Observer pictures are done and dusted in half an hour, Taylor and Goddard changing in and out of their candy boilersuits like pros. \u201cI wrote the [new] songs for people to bathe in, or be lost in an active way,\u201d Taylor explains, as we order an Uber afterwards. \u201cTo have a deep listening experience with it, without any distractions, if they can.\u201d Both have railed before about how they dislike mindless escapism in pop. \u201cAnd escapism is the opposite of what we should be doing in our lives, for political and ecological reasons.\u201d They find the world around them frightening: Goddard regularly retweets anti-Trump and climate change messages. But Taylor would never write direct protest songs. \u201cRather than just saying, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Brexit and there\u2019s Trump in power\u2019, instead we\u2019ll write songs like Positive, which is about looking for positivity \u2013 asking people to support those around them suffering from mental health problems or facing difficulty with poverty or homelessness. I\u2019m thinking in songs instead, to try and figure out an answer.\u201d Mindful escapism, perhaps? In a way, A Bath Full of Ecstasy began life as a Katy Perry project. She had asked for Taylor and Goddard\u2019s services while making her 2017 album, Witness, and they spent four days in Air Studios together. \u201cIt was incredibly exciting,\u201d says Goddard, giddily. \u201cI loved writing for somebody else. She was great, very funny and easygoing, unlike the people around her. They\u2019d text: \u2018Katy\u2019s coming in 20 minutes\u2019, \u2018Katy\u2019s walking through the door\u2019, \u2018Katy\u2019s standing in front of you.\u2019\u201d One of these songs, Into Me You See, made it on to Perry\u2019s album; two others, Spell and Echo, have been reworked by Hot Chip for theirs. Then came their own sessions \u2013 and that eyebrow-raising title. Surely it\u2019s not a midlife crisis drug-taking record? Goddard admits that he\u2019s been \u201cmicrodosing on mushrooms a bit, which is a bit zeitgeisty\u201d. Taylor revealed earlier this year in a Q interview that he has never taken ecstasy. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t meant to be a forceful thing. It wasn\u2019t an anti-drugs message. I mean, I haven\u2019t taken it.\u201d He looks at Goddard. \u201cBut everybody else in the band has.\u201d They both laugh. The title came from a line from a song they wrote early on, \u201cand it was just the most evocative and interesting and fun that endured, and just a bit of a break from too serious a title. And I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem to have a title that could be fun or playful or light-hearted in some ways. Ecstasy is just a nice thing to be talking about these days, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He stops. \u201cI mean, the actual feeling of ecstasy.\u201d \u201cAnd trying to present a kind of positivity in this world also feels like a valid contribution,\u201d Goddard says. \u201cIt\u2019s a worthwhile thing to do.\u201d It\u2019s now 3.15pm and we\u2019re standing outside a corner shop. Our Uber keeps getting cancelled. We hail a black cab in a hurry, piling in with the boys\u2019 costume bags on our knees (this doesn\u2019t happen to Katy Perry, I suggest). Goddard talks about the last time Hot Chip played Victoria Park in 2007. He had been DJing after a gig the previous night, finally falling asleep at 9am. He woke up at 5pm, just as the band were coming off stage. (Clarke had been with him too, although he made the last 20 minutes of the gig.) \u201cI can still remember the dread,\u201d Goddard shudders. Things are slightly different these days. Now he\u2019s planning family camping trips across Europe around the band\u2019s summer festivals. A few hours later, we\u2019re backstage ahead of the gig. Primal Scream, Little Simz and Kate Tempest are Hot Chip\u2019s neighbours. Among them is Hot Chip percussionist Rob Smoughton, who talks about the time Elton John invited all of Hot Chip backstage at a festival in California in 2015. \u201cHe was so knowledgeable about the band \u2013 he knew everything! \u2013 and was so bloody nice.\u201d Then comes Owen Clarke, recoiling when I mention Goddard\u2019s missed gig recollections (\u201coh God\u201d), Felix Martin and the cheerful Al Doyle, who confirms his position as the \u201cclassiest\u201d band member (Goddard\u2019s description) by telling me about a party he went to at former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger\u2019s house and by making me a G&amp;T from their rider. An hour later, he\u2019s dressed in that tunic and wide trousers, joining his strange parade of bandmates to raise hell on the All Points East stage. The opening notes of Huarache Lights shimmer, and we\u2019re off. The set is fantastic, old and young singing along like total converts. Taylor drags a Leffe bottle over his guitar strings and bursts into laughter during Ready for the Floor when a refreshed teenager wearing a silver bumbag shouts its chorus line back to him (\u201cYou\u2019re my number one guy\u201d). And then comes something absurd and completely brilliant: Hot Chip cover Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage. Taylor shouts into two microphones, Goddard nearly rocks himself off the stage, everyone else going berserk. Twenty-seven years of friendship distilled into six minutes of euphoria and the spirit of a teenage basement transported to the open air. Hot Chip make us bathe in that feeling. And it\u2019s worthwhile. A Bath Full of Ecstasy is released by Domino on 21 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
