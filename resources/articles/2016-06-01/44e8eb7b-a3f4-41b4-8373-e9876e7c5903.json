So when we picked Portugal we were not only thinking about their technical qualities, and the fact they are a very good football side, but also the fact they have a special individual.\u201d Unfortunately for England, the plan fell through and the head coach was explaining all this at roughly the same time as paparazzi shots were being sent around the world of Ronaldo sunbathing aboard a yacht in Ibiza wearing nothing but a tiny pair of shorts, sunglasses and a baseball cap turned the wrong way round. Yet it does speak volumes about how seriously England are taking the danger of Bale and it is also worth noting the Football Association also tried to arrange a friendly against Argentina so that Chris Smalling, John Stones et al could experience what it is like when Lionel Messi gets the ball and starts picking up speed. Instead England\u2019s latest assignment has a different look now Ronaldo has been given time off after Real Madrid\u2019s triumph in the Champions League. Portugal never seem so daunting without the three-times Ballon d\u2019Or winner and Hodgson will use the occasion to fine-tune his team for the game against Russia in Marseille a week on Saturday. Bale? He can wait for now. England have other matters to deal with first. If Hodgson is serious about the prospect of shoehorning Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy into the same attack, the Portugal game, one imagines, will be the time to examine if it can work. Hodgson has to decide whether the 4-3-3 system will suit his players best in France or whether they work better in a midfield diamond. Most of all, he has to get the right balance when, by his own admission, England have a \u201csurfeit of attacking players, in midfield and up front, which is why I\u2019ve chosen a squad that\u2019s tipped towards attacking rather than defending\u201d. Hodgson acknowledges it is a calculated gamble but, if nothing else, he is at least giving the public what it wants \u2013 boldness \u2013 by selecting five strikers and it has also become apparent Marcus Rashford has already made a favourable impression, even discounting the goal against Australia last Friday that made him the youngest England player to score on his debut. \u201cI strongly believe he deserves his place in the squad,\u201d Rooney said of his Manchester United team-mate. \u201cHis attitude is fantastic. He can be a dangerous player for us. He had a fantastic debut, scoring after two minutes. We can appreciate how tough the decision was for Roy to make but Marcus deserves to be here because of the way he\u2019s played. He\u2019s a strong-minded lad for an 18-year-old and he can certainly bring a lot of fear to defences.\u201d Rooney has set out to chaperone Rashford in the same way he remembers Steven Gerrard helping him during his own early England experiences. These are often unseen touches behind the scenes but their importance cannot be under-estimated in Hodgson\u2019s eyes. Rooney was the only player the England manager would confirm starts against Portugal and it was also noteworthy Hodgson invited his captain to address the entire squad during a meeting at the team hotel on Tuesday evening. \u201cWayne stood up and gave them the benefit of his experience, telling them what to expect,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cI\u2019d given my introductory bit and I asked if he\u2019d mind saying a few words. I knew the message would be powerful coming from him and he agreed straight away.\u201d Although it is not something they want to say publicly, for fear of being accused of falling into the same trap as previous tournaments, Hodgson and Rooney have both been talking to the players about going with the mentality to win the championship. Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist who has worked with Liverpool , will also be with the squad in France, just as he was for the World Cup, and he was also invited to speak to the players. \u201cWe don\u2019t regard him as peripheral,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe\u2019s there to help the players when they feel they need help and to make certain that on the occasions we\u2019re discussing the philosophy of our tournament he can play a role.\u201d England\u2019s warm-up programme has generally gone well \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve liked a lot more than I\u2019ve not liked,\u201d Hodgson said \u2013 and it reflects the times, perhaps, that maybe the hardest question was about Kane taking corners. \u201cI don\u2019t need to apologise,\u201d Hodgson batted back. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a player with his quality striking a ball and no one else in the team who comes up to that level, we\u2019ll use him.\u201d Kane will carry on taking corners and Hodgson will continue thinking his team should opt for an attack-first policy. Don\u2019t expect a goalless draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
