Souness, who enjoyed a year in charge of Galatasaray, said: \"I think some of my players approached this thinking that it was going to be an easy game and that was never going to be the case. Maybe we should have had a couple of penalties, when Ciccio [Corrado Grabbi] was pulled down and Steven Reid maybe should have had one too. But this tie isn't over and we can still get through.\" Though Blackburn's major concern before the game was to end their winless run away run from home in Europe, the shadow of England's trip to Istanbul on October 11 loomed large over this fixture. However, the 200 travelling Rovers fans won friends by taking part in a seven-a-side game against Genclerbirligi supporters yesterday morning. The Blackburn fans may have lost that game 4-2 but there were no \"Welcome to Hell\" banners on display inside the 19 Mayis Stadium as the hosts went out of their way to do their bit for Anglo-Turkish relations. One banner said \"Welcome our Guests\". In front of Turkey's coach Senol Gunes the home side made the brighter start and Blackburn could have been out of the tie by half-time had Genclerbirligi taken a stream of clear scoring chances. The absence of their ball-winning captain Garry Flitcroft in midfield left Blackburn exposed and Genclerbirligi poured forward at every opportunity. The veteran midfielder Dino Baggio, making his first start since his arrival from Lazio last month, looked way off the pace. Josip Skoko opened the scoring with a stunning lob from 30 yards. Brad Friedel's decision to race out to challenge Mustafa Ozkan for the ball backfired when his clearing header fell to Skoko's feet. The Australian international sent the ball straight back over Friedel and just under the crossbar. A minute later Souleymane Youla received the ball on the edge of the area from Deniz Baris and the striker sent a low right-foot shot past Friedel to double his side's lead. Brett Emerton's close-range strike after 56 minutes following a fine turn by Andy Cole should have given Blackburn the platform for a respectable result. But Youla's second goal, and his side's third, a 20-yard shot after escaping from Lorenzo Amoruso, leaves Blackburn with a mighty challenge at Ewood Park. Genclerbirligi (3-1-4-2): Gokhan (Botonjic, 45); Saka, Umit Bozkurt, Mercimek; Deniz; Tandogan (Mbayo, 79), Serkan, Skoko, Daems; Youla, Ozkan (Akin Bulent, 88). Blackburn Rovers (4-4-2): Friedel; Neill, Amoruso, Babbel, Gresko; Thompson, Tugay, Baggio (Reid, 68), Emerton; Yorke (Grabbi, 68), Jansen (Cole, 46).
