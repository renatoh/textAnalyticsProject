The teacher, who is also the deputy principal at the Stevincollege, was shot in the head and taken by helicopter to hospital. There were no other injuries, said police spokeswoman Dianna Wezenberg. No additional details of the victim's condition were available, but one of his pupils said he had a likeable and gentle manner. Students and bystanders said that the 17-year-old gunman is of Turkish descent and that the school, located in a bland suburb in the southwest of the Hague, has regular police visits. Student Mohammed Ouledle said: \"Fights are normal here, but nothing like this.\" Another student, who asked not to be named, was in the room when the shooting took place during lunch hour and described the boy as an \"aggressive\" type. She said he walked into the crowded cafeteria and shot the teacher in the forehead with a single bullet. \"I thought it was fireworks. I heard people scream and thought it was a joke.\" The school, with several hundred students of mostly Moroccan and Turkish origin, was cleared and the neighbourhood closed to the public as police investigators moved in with sniffer dogs to search for the suspect and a weapon. The shooter, whose identity was not released, apparently carried out the attack after being suspended for misbehaviour a few days earlier. It was unclear why he had been punished. The incident immediately triggered public debate about violence against teachers and the possible need for security measures at schools. Education minister Maria van der Hoeven was briefed about the shooting while on a working visit to China and dismissed the act as \"incomprehensible and horrible\". The national trade union for teachers called the shooting shocking and said it was the \"first of its kind in the Netherlands\". \"It shows that the violence in our society doesn't exclude schools and education personnel,\" it said. \"But even tight security could not have prevented the awful events of today.\" School shootings are virtually unheard of in the Netherlands, where tight gun laws strictly limit the availability of firearms. In 1999, a student, also of Turkish descent and 17, opened fire on other students in the southern Dutch town of Veghel, wounding five people. The gunman in the country's first recorded school shooting was sentenced to five years in prison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
