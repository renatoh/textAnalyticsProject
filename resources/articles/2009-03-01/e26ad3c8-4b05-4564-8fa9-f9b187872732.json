The 28-year-old, who was bailed for eight weeks following a hearing in January, will appear before the same court for formal pleas and for the case to be committed to crown court for a criminal trial. Gerrard, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and address on his previous visit to court, will appear alongside six other men who have also been charged in relation to the disturbance at the Lounge Club, where a 34-year-old man required hospital treatment after suffering facial injuries. While the court appearance is likely to interfere with Gerrard's training at Liverpool, the captain seems sure to start against Aston Villa at Anfield on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
