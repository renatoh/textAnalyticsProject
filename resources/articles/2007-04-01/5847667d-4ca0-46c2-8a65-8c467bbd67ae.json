You may need a sat-nav system to find it, but the \"consultation paper on policy for service areas and other roadside facilities\" will help determine how many service stations British motorways get in the future. What it shows is that much of the public would rather the powers-that-be did not allow the proliferation of Motos, Welcome Breaks and the rest - and instead encouraged the development of picnic areas. At the moment, drivers who want to take a break from the six lanes of monotony have two choices: either park at a service station; or get off the motorway altogether. French motorists, however, can pull into aires de repose, with picnic tables on patches of grass, toilets and (often) children's play areas -and none of the unnecessary retail opportunities offered to anyone crawling up the M6. True, the food in motorway cafes is no longer so retrograde; even the Little Chef has swapped the nuclear-fried egg and chips for ciabatta sandwiches ... with chips. But how much more pleasant to take your own snacks. A picnic on the M4 is undoubtedly a strange concept but it would alleviate the tedium - it might even turn the traditional slog into that most un-British of journeys, a road trip. It will not, however, solve the problem of that chap in the Saab who keeps cutting you up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
