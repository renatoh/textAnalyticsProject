The proposed changing of annual donations to a system of longer-term funding was supposed to be agreed over the next few days and put into effect by the summer. The change would be manna from heaven for the Labour party, who are currently \u00a36m in debt and have moved out of their infamous Millbank headquarters as a cost-saving measure. Although Bill Morris earlier this week expressed hope the deal would soon be completed, Paul Kenny, a leading official at the GMB, said today that it was \"premature and dangerous\" to talk about a guaranteed level of funding over the next five years. Representatives of the party's big union affiliates are angry that the government is insisting on full Fire Brigades Union compliance with the Bain report, which its leader, Andy Gilchrist, estimates will cost 4,500 jobs. Today's Independent quotes a \"senior GMB source\" as saying: \"The deal has virtually been done but the reality is that the only obstacle at the moment is Downing Street's intransigence in relation to the firefighters dispute. \"Politically we cannot give a commitment to sign off \u00a340m of trade unionists money at a time when the government are trying to rub Andy Gilchrist's nose in the dirt.\" Talks on millions of pounds of union funding have been continuing since last September in a bid to put Labour's finances on a more stable footing. In return, the unions are likely to demand the dropping of the idea of state funding of political parties, which would see their importance and influence diminished. Discussions are continuing, and Mr Kenny, a candidate in the race to become the next GMB general secretary, said a number of problems had to be tackled. He said: \"Unions will face a difficult summer at their conferences over maintaining current levels of financial support, given the outstanding industrial and welfare problems, such as the two-tier workforce, low pay in public services and lack of action on corporate killing. \"The Labour government needs to win back the support of millions of trade union members with legislation that addresses their problems.\" A Labour party spokesperson said: \"The unions are important funders of the Labour party but there cannot and will not be any connection between government policy decisions and funding from the trade unions, or any other source, and this is understood by the unions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
