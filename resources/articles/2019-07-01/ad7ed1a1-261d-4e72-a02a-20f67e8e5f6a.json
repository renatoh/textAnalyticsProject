The spacecraft will take two months to cruise to the moon. Following its arrival, it will manoeuvre into a circular orbit just 62 miles (100km) above the lunar surface. It will then deploy the Vikram lander early in September. This will be India\u2019s first attempt at a soft landing on the moon. If successful, it will make the country the fourth to achieve such a feat, after Russia, the US and China. The chosen landing site is near the lunar south pole, where water ice has been detected in some permanently shadowed craters. Once safely down, the Vikram lander will release a small, six-wheeled rover named Pragyan. The three components of the mission carry a full complement of scientific instruments. Among other things, they will study the moon\u2019s mineral and chemical composition and its topology and seismology. India\u2019s first moon mission, Chandrayaan 1, launched in October 2008 and operated successfully for almost a year. As part of the mission, an impact probe struck the moon\u2019s south pole in a controlled manner. Chandrayaan 2 will launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India\u2019s south-east coast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
