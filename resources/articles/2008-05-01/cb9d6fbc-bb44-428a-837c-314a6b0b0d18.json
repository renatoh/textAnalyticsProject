With a non-chronological narrative that moves in spirals, constantly catching up with itself then returning to the past, the film covers several years in Arkwright's life as pretentious cineaste, embarrassing boozer, chain-smoking alcoholic, substance abuser and compulsive womaniser. Along the way, Arkwright comments wryly on his life (he views himself with contempt and seemingly hopes to win respect for his honesty), indulges in fantasies that include igniting a provocative woman's pubic hair with a flame-thrower and eventually finds salvation in the arms of a good woman. She's a cellist (Saffron Burrows) and he tries to keep on the straight and narrow until bowel cancer intervenes and he's faced with going gentle into that good night. An uncomfortable, unrewarding experience based on a posthumously published autobiographical novel by Stuart Browne and formally inspired, one guesses, by Bob Fosse's All That Jazz"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
