And the TV star \u2013 whose speech at the Golden Globes led to fevered speculation she would run for president \u2013 would be beaten by both Biden and Bernie Sanders in a four-way Democratic primary that also included Elizabeth Warren, the RABA Research survey says. In the poll of 345 registered Democrats about the 2020 election, the former vice-president was better liked than any of his most prominent potential competitors. RABA interviewed the Democratic voters between 10 and 11 January via an online survey. The margin of error was five points. Some 76% of Democratic voters had a somewhat favorable or very favorable opinion of the former vice-president. In contrast, only 67% of Democratic voters felt the same about Winfrey, leaving her even with the leftwing former Democratic hopeful Sanders and ahead of Massachusetts senator Warren, whom only 58% of Democratic voters had a very favorable or somewhat favorable opinion of. When the four were polled against each other, Biden was the most popular, winning 26% of the vote in a four-way race. Sanders was at 21%, Winfrey at 20% and Warren at 18%. The poll is one of the first measurements of Winfrey\u2019s political standing after her much-praised speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday about sexual harassment and abuse against women. The speech immediately prompted speculation about the talkshow host\u2019s political prospects as well as a response from Donald Trump, who insisted that he could best Winfrey in an election. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll beat Oprah. Oprah would be a lot of fun,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. Although at least one poll has measured Winfrey\u2019s prospects in a general election against Trump \u2013 finding her more popular than the president by 10 points \u2013 this is the first time her standing in a Democratic primary was been surveyed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
