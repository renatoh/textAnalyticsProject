Clarke is 65, but Winston Churchill was older when he became prime minister. General de Gaulle was 68 when he became president of France and Konrad Adenauer was still chancellor of West Germany at 87. It could, perhaps, have been his fatness (Catherine Bennett thought it ruled him out as Tory leader), but I doubt that, too - while everyone pays lip service to the idea that fatness is a very bad thing, and nobody chooses to be fat, people are generally reassured, as Julius Caesar was, by fatness in others. Clarke's smoking may not have helped, and there are those who regard him as a peddler of death because of his involvement with British American Tobacco. But even today cigars are viewed with an indulgence not granted to cigarettes and have a fairly benign Churchillian image. Better by far to smoke cigars than to be suspected of having snorted cocaine. Clarke is clever, energetic, eloquent, amusing, hugely experienced and widely popular, so what was it about him that persuaded his fellow MPs to eject him from the leadership race at the first ballot? Was it his refusal to renounce his long-held attachment to Europe? Even that seems unlikely. Only fools and bigots want Britain to pull out of the EU: among sensible people, the European argument turns only on the degree of integration. And as Clarke has pointed out, that's hardly an issue at the moment. No, it was something else that did him in. Not his opposition to the invasion of Iraq: that was shared by a majority of people in this country. Not his love of motor sports, cricket, football and jazz: these are some of the things that have made him so popular. No, it was simply his rejection of the idea that the Conservative party has to be reborn in order to return to power. According to David Cameron, the party has to \"look, feel, think and behave like a completely new organisation\" if it is to get anywhere. I doubt if Clarke has any idea what Cameron is talking about. As a former \"moderniser\" who helped promote equal opportunity within the party, he may even be astonished that its latest modernisation prospectus involves restoring Eton and White's club to their ancient supremacy. He would be as sceptical about \"New Conservative\" as he is about \"New Labour\", which he associates with \"an obsession with style over substance and a scorn for parliamentary government\". He doesn't want to be \"new\" anything; he just wants to be an old-style British parliamentarian. I like Ken Clarke. I like him for the reasons he wants to be liked - for, as he puts it, his \"refusal to bow before the strictures of political correctness\" and for \"what the political witch-doctors call 'authenticity'\". If the Conservative party does not cherish such a man, it deserves to remain in the wilderness, however much it may seek to portray itself as \"a completely new organisation\". The moment that Clarke emerged defeated and crestfallen from the House of Commons to face the TV cameras was one of the saddest I have experienced for a long time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
