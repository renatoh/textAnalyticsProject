What a team and what a game. It was really tough. They did so many smart things ... it was really good ... But we had really big chances. They did a lot of things but we were ready to defend it. It was a just a very intense game. Then we scored two wonderful goals, and we could have scored six or seven ... We had to put a shift in. But when we had the ball, we had to play calm and then we were immediately in front of their goal and missed sitters, pretty much.\u201d On Salah, he says \u201cI have no clue how he scored,\u201d and adds that nor does he have a clue how he missed some of the fist-half chances. \u201cIt looked like it\u2019s not his night so to stay on track and then score like that is great.\u201d Andy Robertson: \u201cWe knew chances would keep coming and if we could be more clinical, we could [win]. Mo had a couple of great chances. We were jut saying to him \u2018the next, the next one, the next one\u2019 ... and then he scored a ridiculous goal. \u201cPeople say we\u2019ve maybe struggled through [to the knockout phases] but we got four points more than we did last year.\u201d Sadio Man\u00e9 (formerly of RB Salzburg]: \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to come back because it\u2019s where everything started for me. I\u2019m grateful to everyone. Sorry, guys, but this is football. The European champions are safely into this season\u2019s knockout stages as group winners. This was highly impressive performance against a dangerous team. Nady Ke\u00efta and Mohamed Salah scored beautiful goals, and Liverpool could have had several more, though they also needed Alisson and Van Dijk to be in top form. 90+1 min: Wijnaldum intercepts a pass on half-way and then launches into a raid down the left. Once he reaches the box he feeds Salah, who takes a touch and then drags his shot wide. His finishing has been mostly diabolical today ... which makes that goal he scored even more outrageous. 89 min: Liverpool miss another chance to make it 3-0, Man\u00e9 skying his shot from 10 yards after Salah got out of the way of Henderson\u2019s pass to avoid being penalised for offside. Liverpool substitution: Origi on, Ke\u00efta off. 85 min: Another Liverpool wave crashes in on the Salzburg box. If Robertson\u2019s pass to Man\u00e9 had not been slightly overhit at the end, it would probably have been 3-0. 82 min: Henderson pops the ball over the top for Man\u00e9 to chase. He and Salah then takes turns setting each other up for shots. Salzburg scramble back in numbers to avoid conceding a third. But Liverpool have shown them who\u2019s boss in this half. 80 min: Liverpool pressurise Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 into conceding a corner. Alexander-Arnold pegs it low to Keita in front of the near post. He lays it back for Salah, who wraps his foot around it and aims for the far post from 18 yards. It\u2019s blocked. 77 min: Salah waits for Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 to challenge him, then rolls his way around him and aim a curling shot towarsd the far corner. But he didn\u2019t get his angle quite right this time, so Stankovic makes the save. Salzburg substitution: Okugawa on, Haaland off. The 19-year-old did not live up to his star billing today. Think its fair to say he\u2019s peaked. Liverpool substitution: Milner on, Firmino off. 73 min: Firmino tries to poke a shot in from an acute angle on the left. He hits the sidenetting. And that\u2019s hist last contribution ... 72 min: Hwang\u2019s shot deflected out for a corner. When it\u2019s delivered, Alisson collects with ease. 70 min: Liverpool are managing this relatively well now. They don\u2019t quite have Salzburg in a headlock but they\u2019re keeping them at arm\u2019s length, and the hosts\u2019 vim is slowly dwindling. Meanwhile, in reference to Eric Schwab\u2019s suggestion on 46 minutes, Grant Tennille quips: \u201cI\u2019ve always considered AOC to be more of a squad player.\u201d Salzburg substitution: Daka on, Jununzovic off 68 min: Another unpretentious save by Alisson, who clasps a long-range effort by Hwang like a man collecting his parcel from his mailbox. 67 min: Alexander-Arnold tries to curl a cheeky freekick from wide on the left into the near post. The keeper doesn\u2019t see it coming, but he\u2019s in the clear because the shot isn\u2019t on target. 65 min: I (read: somebody else) have counted how long there was between the Liverpool goals, and the answer is a nice round 100 seconds. Thought you\u2019d like to know. 62 min: Salzburg try to fight on in the name of the seemingly impossible. But there\u2019s not as much conviction about them now, and Liverpool, remembering what happened at Anfield, don\u2019t seem in the mood to relent. That\u2019s a ridiculous goal, especially bearing in mind Salah\u2019s previous misses today! He ran on to a pass by Henderson, took it away from the keeper and then - from way out on the right and a preposterous angle - he clipped it into the net! It was a little like Mark Hughes\u2019 goal for Manchester United against Barcelona in the Cup Winners\u2019 up final way back when. Suddenly Liverpool are on Easy Street! Liverpool have the breakthrough at last, thanks to a header by Ke\u00efta against his former club! It was a splendid goal. Alexander-Arnold began the move by spanking a long diagonal pass to Robertson, who helped it on to Man\u00e9. The Senegal international ran into the left-hand side of the box. The keep came to close him down but he chipped a dainty cross into the middle, where Ke\u00efta rose to nod into the net from 10 yards. 56 min: Superb, sweeping move by Liverpool. It started with Alexander-Arnold, featured a nice touch by Salah and looked set to finish with Mane, but Kristensen defended brilliantly. 55 min: This is a match where Liverpool could really have done with Fabinho. Liverpool substitution: Gomez on, Lovren off. The Croatian has suffered an injury and limps off. This is not an easy match to come into off the bench. Gomez is going to have to get up to speed mighty fast. 52 min: Haaland roars into the left-hand side of the box and cracks a ferocious low shot into the sidenetting. 50 min: Firmino nips a lovely pass through to Salah, who tries to take the ball around the advancing keeper at the edge of the area. His timing is perfect, as he beats the keeper to the ball, but he only nudges it a little to the side, allowing the keeper to stretch out to poke it away! If Salah had put just a little more on that, he would have had a free shot into an empty goal from 18 yards! 48 min: Gorgeous pass by Man\u00e9 right into the path of the on-rushing Salah ... who lifts it over the keeper and the bar from 10 yards! That wasn\u2019t as bad as his earlier miss - because he had little time - but it was far from good. 46 min: 16 seconds into the second period, Alisson has to lope out of his box to kick into touch before Hwang can collect a pass into the right-hand channel. 46 min: Here come the teams. Incidentally, according to BT, this is the most shots there have been without a goal in a half in the Champions League for 15 years. \u201cWhen does this officially become a Salah slump?\u201d parps Eric Schwab. For my money I would prefer to see Origi or AOC (!) in the game.\u201d I see what you did there. In fairness, though, Salah has produced some canny touches and passes so far. But his finishing has been awful. \u201cPlease explain the permutations for scores in the second half,\u201d pleads Ashley Cotter-Cairns. Assuming Napoli go on to win their match - they\u2019re 3-0 up at the moment - then Liverpool will go through with a win or a draw. If they lose, then Salzburg go through instead .... UNLESS Liverpool scores four goals or more and lose by only a one-goal deficit (so 5-4, 6-5, 22-21, etc.). Liverpool have expressed their support for an investigation into those deaths. On a more distressing note, consider this: Amazingly, there were no goals in that half despite the huge number of chances created by both sides. You can attribute that to good goalkeeping and slightly shoddy finishing. It\u2019s been a marvellously entertaining game, playing at a blistering tempo and with a lot of nimble skills and audacity. Expect all that gain in the second half - and even more drama, with both sides\u2019 fates still very much in the balance. 45 min: Liverpool attack. Firmino feeds Salah, who plays a lovely pass through to the overlapping Keita, who tries to flip it past the keeper with the outside of his right foot. But Stankovic spreads himself well to make a vital save. 44 min: Freekick to Liverpool 10 yards inside the opposing half. Alexander-Arnold sends a diagonal one towards the far side of the box. Haaland, back defending, wellies it away. 41 min: Mwepu unleashes a fierce, crisp shot from 25 yards. If it had been towards either of the corner, Alisson would have been in trouble. As it was, the keeper just has to stand his ground, keep his eye on the ball and make the save in that unfussy way of his. 39 min: Haaland has been pretty well contained by Liverpool so far. Minamino and Hwang, on the other hand, look very sharp and they threaten nearly every time they get the ball. They\u2019re bringing the best out of Van Dijk, in particular. 36 min: A defensive mistakes by Salzburg presents the ball to Firmino. For a moment Liverpool look like profiting but Salzburg regroup as quickly as they press at the other end, and the threat fades. 34 min: Salah takes the freekick ... and wafts it miles wide. His finishing has been quite spectacularly bad so far today. 33 min: W\u00f6ber grabs Salah to concede a foul right on the edge of the box, to the right... 31 min: In this group\u2019s other game, Napoli are beating Genk 2-0. That makes it all the more important for Liverpool to avoid defeat here ... 28 min: Keita tees up Salah for a simple finish from 10 yards. But he drags it wide, and not by a little! By the standards of this game he had an age to decide what to weigh up his options, but he totally bungled his shot. What Liverpool don\u2019t want to happen now is for him to try to atone by shooting from everywhere as soon as he gets the ball. He\u2019s been known to do that. 26 min: Forget what I said about control. It was an illusion. This is a frantic , exhilarating game. No one can relax for a moment out there. Robetson has just had to make a super sliding tackle to foil Hwang. 23 min: Minomino, who has been scheming beautifully \u2018in the hole\u2019 for Salzburg, picks out a pass to Haaland, charging into the left-hand side of the box. He drills a low shot goalward. It\u2019s another comfortable save for Alisson, but another another warning of the danger Salzburg carry even though Liverpool have had slightly more control in the last few minutes. 21 min: Minamino slips a pass through to Hwang, who tries to shoot while running into the left-hand side of the Lvierpool box. But he doesn\u2019t catch it cleanly, so it\u2019s a straightforward save for Alisson. 21 min: Mane darts on to a cute pass by Wijnaldum and tries to curl a shot from the right-hand side of the box into the far corner. The keeper makes a meal of pushing it away. Keita retrieves and unloads a shot from 18 yards. It\u2019s blocked. Alexander-Arnold pounces on the follow-up but blasts over the bar. 19 min: Robertson\u2019s corner from the left is cleared. Suddenly Haaland is racing on to a big hoof downfield. Alisson rushes out of his box to tidy up. 17 min: The pace has dipped a little, as Liverpool try to exert some authority with steady possession play. \u201cIs it just me or are all-dark red kits very similar to all-black kits?\u201d wonders Bob Moore. \u201cCouldn\u2019t the Liverpool kit man have packed one of the multitude of \u2018alternate\u2019 kits?\u201d The contrast between the kits could certainly be clearer. There\u2019s a good case for home teams having the right to pick the outfit that visitors must wear. Polka dots, hats, nurse\u2019s uniform, all options should be open. 14 min: Most teams struggle to cope with Liverpool\u2019s speed and intensity. but Salzburg are matching it, maybe even exceeding it, at the moment. 12 min: Nice exchange between Man\u00e9 and Robertson. The Scot bangs a low ball across the face of goal, but it\u2019s cleared for a throw-in. 10 min: A wonderful shoulder challenge by Van Dijk on Hwang, who\u2019s sent sideways like a skateboarder trying to ditch a bus off the road. 8 min: Man\u00e9 tries to guide a curler into the bottom corner from just outside the box. He misses by a yard. 7 min: Lovely interplay by Salzburg! Hwang played a foxy backheel to Minamino in the box and then dashed in to retrieve the return pass. From eight yards he tries to stab the ball over the out-rushing Alisson, who stands up and makes a sharp one-handed save. 6 min: Liverpool apply more pressure on the home box. A chipped cross from Mane narrowly misses the far post. The ball pingpongs around the area before Salzburg eventually scramble it away. 5 min: Lovren flights a well-aimed ball from deep over the top of the home defence. Salah takes it down and fires off a shot from 16 yards. Stankovic bats it behind for a corner. The early indications are there is no chance of this ending 0-0! 3 min: Frantic pressing by the hosts forces Alisson into a sloppy kick. Salzburg regain possession in the Liverpool half and quickly work the ball to Mwepu, who has a pop from 25 yards. It swirls a bit but Alisson holds it safely. 2 min: Van Dijk has to make another crucial intervention, a sliding tackle on the edge of the area to stop Hwang\u2019s burst. 1 min: Salzburg-Liverpool is go! The visitors get the game going ... but within 15 seconds, Haaland is racing on to a through-ball delivered from deep. It looked for a moment like he would reach shooting range before Van Dijk caught him. But the Dutchman shifted into top gear and made a critical challenge. The teams enter the arena, which contains just over 30,000 very excited people. They\u2019re making a heck of din and, not so intimidatingly, waving colourful tinfoil. The home side are wearing all black, the visitors all red. It\u2019s on! The teams are in the tunnel .... Salzburg fans (or, come to think of it, maybe their potty-mouthed manager) have have erected a giant banner running across the top tier of one of the stands in the stadium. It reads, in English, \u201cWe are not Bar\u00e7a or Real, but we are ready for our fucking dream.\u201d Good night, Vienna. \u201cMr Erich Linemayr was the ref at that Forest-Liverpool game (and also later at the final),\u201d announces Tom Reichart. \u201cHe was from Linz, which isn\u2019t too far from Salzburg. The German Wikipedia tells me he also refereed the Water Battle between Poland and Germany in 1974 and the \u201cmatch\u201d between Chile and the Soviet Union in 1973. Enjoy!\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that, after getting knocked out at the group stages in 2012, Chelsea went on to win Europa League, thus holding both Champions League and the Europa League simultaneously,\u201d protests Krish. \u201cTempting to Liverpool, I would say.\u201d I would say not. If they were to lose today, the most tempting would be to win the world club title later this month (becoming simultaneously European and world champions) and sack off the Europa League to concentrate on winning the Premier League, which they haven\u2019t won since .... when was it again? Having said that, maybe they\u2019ll have the domestic title in the bag by the time European competition resumes next year. Speaking just now on BT, Liverpool\u2019s manager isn\u2019t attempting to downplay the importance of this rumble: \u201cOur Champions League trip has been like this since we started it. We always have these kinds of situations so it\u2019s no surprise. That\u2019s how it is and we have to be ready for it. No good just talking about it, we have to show it.\u201d As for his explanation for the inclusion of Ke\u00efta, he says: \u201cIt makes absolute sense for this game for the way we need to play. ... And he knows the stadium, but that was not the reason for it.\u201d Any Liverpool fans think this year has a 1979 feel to it? Back then, like now, Liverpool were aiming to reach the final of Europe\u2019s top club competition for the third year in a row (having won it the previous two) and they only went and got knocked out in their very first tie. That was before group stage gerrymandering, of course. Their conquerors? Nottingham Forest. And the referee when Forest scored their decisive goals was from Salzburg! Well, he might have been. He was definitely from Austria, I know that much. On the plus side, Liverpool went on to win the domestic title that season... No messing from Klopp. And a powerful vote of confidence for Naby Ke\u00efta, whose improved recent form earns him a start at his former club ahead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Salzburg: Stankovic; Nissen, Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9, W\u00f6ber, Ulmer; Szoboszlai, Junozovic, Minamino, Mwepu; Hwang, Haaland Subs: Carlos, Daka, Ashimeru, Okugawa, Prevljak, Ramalho, VAllci Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Ke\u00efta, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Man\u00e9, Firmino, Salah Subs: Adrian, Jones, Gomez, Milner, Shaqiri, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Origi Referee: D Makkelie (Ned) Hello. Welcome to a match that Liverpool never wanted to matter. The European champions were expected to have wrapped up qualification for the knockout stages by now. Instead they travel to Austria at risk of becoming only the second holders in the Champions League era \u2013 after Chelsea in 2012 - to be eliminated in the group phase. Nobody wants to be like Chelsea. The risk is real. Salzburg are free-scoring buccaneers with boundless energy and a genuine prodigy up front: 19-year-old Erling Braut Haalann, scorer of 28 goals in 21 matches so far this season, including eight in his five group games so far. That includes the one he hit when these sides met at Anfield, when Liverpool cantered into a 3-0 lead before being slapped repeatedly across the chops and waking up in time to prevail 4-3. That lesson should serve Liverpool well today. There\u2019s unlikely to be any complacency from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team and the manager, surely, will deploy his full-strength side after giving key players time off in their last two Premier League matches. So Liverpool will be going full gun. And so, too, will Salzburg, who are aiming to claim a famous scalp and make history by reaching the knockout stages. Roll up, roll up, we have ourselves a proper showdown! Kick-off: 5.55pm GMT, 6.55pm local"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
