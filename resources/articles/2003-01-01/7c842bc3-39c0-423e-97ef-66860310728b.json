There's no doubt about it - heads will roll.\" In two-and-a-half years as editor of the biggest-selling Sunday paper, Wade set the pace among Sunday tabloids with a string of scoops including the Prince Harry drugs scandal, Angus Deayton's romp with a prostitute and Sophie Rhys Jones' infamous sting at the hands of Mahzer Mahmood. Most infamously of all there was her controversial \"naming and shaming\" of paedophiles, which her opponents claim led to vigilante attacks. During her tenure the circulation of the Sunday paper increased by around 5%. Wade, already the youngest editor on Fleet Street at 34, now becomes the first ever woman editor of the country's biggest selling national. \"Everybody expected it was going to happen,\" said one source. \"It wasn't a case of 'if' she was going to replace David as the editor of the Sun, but 'when'. \"Everyone knew David would go upstairs and Rebekah would come over. She was exceedingly ambitious and a big favourite of the management at News International. \"She made no secret that she wanted to become the first woman editor of a daily paper, and what better place to do that than the Sun?\" Those at the Sun who have worked under her recall the tensions between her and Yelland after he arrived in mid-1998. He was interested in American politics and business - two subjects far from the agenda under previous editors Stuart Higgins and the legendary Kelvin MacKenzie. Wade on the other hand was interested in TV and showbiz - two subjects that have been downgraded under Yelland. She was also uncomfortable with page three - a sentiment shared by proprietor Rupert Murdoch. But while neither thought they could get rid of what had become an institution since the page was introduced 30 years ago, Wade succeeded in getting rid of the saucy captions and introduced a degree of modesty to the photo shoots in a bid to make them look a little more upmarket. Staff on the paper expect immediate executive changes - there was speculation today that she will bring over her favourites - Andy Coulson (deputy editor of News of the World) and columnist Ally Ross. However, some believe that Coulson could get the News of the World editorship. \"Wade is one of the most nakedly ambitious people I have ever come across. The fact she holidayed on Lachlan Murdoch's yacht off Barbados speaks volumes. She is an inveterate networker - she is best mates with Elisabeth Murdoch and now with Lachlan and if there was anyone else that would draw her closer to Rupert she would be their best mates too,\" said one journalist. While some staff were anxious about the future, others welcomed her return. \"Is it a good or bad thing for the Sun? It will certainly be even more showbiz now that she is in charge. She made a lot of changes at the Screws and I've no doubt there will be lots to come at the Sun,\" said one staffer. \"She is totally across both news and features, so no one will be left alone. A lot of people at the Sun will be quaking in their boots - she expects a lot and upsets a lot of people - but the News of the World office will be breathing a sigh of relief.\" Wade clashed last year with the editor of the Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore, who said she was too close to Mark Bolland, Prince Charles's former deputy private secretary, and Guy Black, the director of the press complaints commission. The Telegraph implied the three had colluded on the Prince Harry drug-taking story, and Moore called the PCC a \"stitch-up\". Wade retaliated by printing \"10 Things You Never Knew About Charles Moore,\" and branded him \"the hypocrite of Fleet Street\". It doesn't always go Wade's way. She flounced out of the Press Awards this year and staged her own rival ceremony at a nearby hotel after the News of the World was overlooked for any of the honours. The paper's table was occupied by a single \"fake sheikh\" - in deference to Mazir Mahmood's infamous disguise - who had originally been booked to pick up an award. There was also a bizarre claim by one of the paper's former journalists that she had ordered him to dress up as Harry Potter on September 11. Charles Begley changed his name by deed poll to Harry Potter when he became the paper's official Harry Potter correspondent. He alleged he was ordered into Wade's office on the afternoon of the attacks dressed as the fictional schoolboy wizard, a claim vehemently denied by News International executives. Wade, who last year married former EastEnder Ross Kemp, was appointed editor of the News of the World in May 2000, succeeding Phil Hall. She made her mark with the controversial \"name and shame\" campaign within six months of taking control. She threatened last year to reinstate the campaign if the paper's demands for \"Sarah's law\" were not met. After the publication of the Sophie tapes, the Queen in a statement spoke of \"entrapment, subterfuge, innuendo and untruths\". But Wade argued there was a strong public interest defence for publishing the material, saying it had generated a massive debate. Wade was not slow in bringing her own people to the News of the World, including Coulson, Ross and Rav Singh, who all joined the paper from the Sun. She is expected to do the same thing now she has succeeded Yelland. A hands-on operator, Wade has a reputation for \"mental sharpness, untempered dedication and almost psychotic ambition\". Staffers at the Sun will find out for themselves tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
