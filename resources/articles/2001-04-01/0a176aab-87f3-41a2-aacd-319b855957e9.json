Anglo-Dutch information technology services group CMG put an immediate damper on Wednesday's US interest rate cut-induced stock market euphoria with a warning that a squeeze on spending by mobile phone companies would push its telecoms products business into the red in the first half of the year. There was, however, more optimistic news from SAP, Europe's biggest software group. It turned in better than expected first quarter results, backed by an upbeat assessment of the immediate outlook and raising hopes that the slowdown in spending on software in the US might not be so dramatic in Europe. CMG said its wireless data solutions business, which specialises in producing the software for text messaging, would post an operating loss of \u00a330m for the first half of the year - after spending a similar amount on research and development. The group said that after doubling sales last year WDS had got off to a slow start this year as telecoms operators put upgrades of short message services on hold. CMG said it expected a pick up in WDS's business as operators were forced to upgrade but said it was difficult to be precise over timing. \"WDS's performance through the remainder of 2001 will be dependent on a sustained increase in message volumes and consequent licence and systems upgrades,\" the company said. The news gave the market a fright with CMG shares falling 83p to 360p in London, after touching a two year low of 337p at one stage. \"It may only be 20% of the business, but it is much more profitable. It is very worrying. The shares have already fallen sharply this year, possibly too much, but it has a rich rating.\" said one analyst. Finance director David Robbie said he expected the WDS operation to be profitable in the second half of the year though profitability over the full year would be a \"significant challenge\". There was no such caution from SAP. \"Despite the difficult market environment, SAP is optimistic about the first three quarters of 2001,\" the group said in a statement. Net profits in the first quarter more than doubled to \u20ac117m (\u00a372m) on sales up almost 30%, with the group predicting that turnover for the first nine months would be 23% ahead of the same period in 2000. \"It was a very strong set of results, pretty much across the board,\" according to Daud Khan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. SAP's upbeat assessment follows warnings from rivals in the online business to business sector, such as Oracle and Ariba, which revealed that results were being affected by slowing US economic growth, causing a slowdown in software spending. The worries from the United States had turned SAP's performance into a closely watched indicator. \"All [SAP's] important competitors have revised their outlook for the year while SAP has more or less continued theirs and said things will continue as they have been before,\" said Sal Oppenheim analyst Alla Gorelova. SAP underlined its confidence by revealing that unlike some of its competitors which had laid off staff it had increased its head count by about 1,000 since the beginning of the year. Shares in SAP rose \u20ac13.4 to \u20ac167.4 in Frankfurt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
