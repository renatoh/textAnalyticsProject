Their motivation may be transparent, the enthusiasm hardly likely to sway the manager's thinking but Houllier still has plenty to ponder. Only late last week the Frenchman was bemoaning the fact that his profligate strikers had contributed only one of his side's 10 goals this season and that from the penalty spot. Now, in the wake of Saturday's rumbustious display at the Reebok, he appears spoiled for choice. \"You can't expect me to play all four,\" smiled Houllier. With Michael Owen and El Hadji Diouf fidgeting awkwardly on the bench this was an opportunity for Milan Baros and Emile Heskey to shine. The latter was given only five minutes away from uncomfortable duties on the left flank and duly capitalised to slam in the winner, his first goal since England swept past Denmark in Niigata. Bolton, excellent throughout but giddy after Ivan Campo's equaliser had pegged the visitors back to 2-2 for a fourth consecutive match, did not touch the ball between restart and concession. Yet the main attraction was Baros. The youngster, signed from Banik Ostrava for \u00a33.2m while Houllier was recuperating after heart surgery, played 16 punchless minutes for the first team last season, albeit at the Camp Nou. After six goals in his previous two appearances - for club reserves and country - the 20-year-old struck the post when he should have scored 39 minutes into his Premiership debut but was irrepressible thereafter. It is incon- ceivable that Owen will not feature in Liverpool's European opener tomorrow but, while the Czech may be similar in stature and style, this evidence suggest they would be a logical pairing. Dietmar Hamann's pass and Bruno Cheyrou's stepover allowed Baros to by-pass Mike Whitlow and turn inside Simon Charlton before crunching a shot beyond Jussi Jaaskelainen to earn Liverpool the lead. His second, a volley steered beyond the Finn from Steven Gerrard's cross, re-established that advantage. \"He's the reason we let Jari Litmanen leave,\" said Houllier, who first spotted Baros playing for the Czech under-18s in Ireland only to be advised against signing him by his first-team coach Jacques Crevoisier. The former France under-20s coach's disapproval was sparked by the memory of Baros's theatricals during a junior international. \"He told me he didn't like the boy from what he'd seen in that match but I back my own judgment,\" said Houllier. \"Then it took Milan six months to settle in and, while my staff didn't come up to me and tell me I'd bought a duff, that's what they were thinking. \"Milan realised that, if he wanted to improve, he'd have to pull it together and came back for pre-season having lost about four kilos. Sammy Lee and Phil Thompson admit now that I'd seen something in him they hadn't. It just proves we've got the cover to sustain a challenge this season.\" That challenge should be all the more credible once Liverpool have their first-choice defence available. The makeshift rearguard laboured again against Bolton, who can draw much encouragement even in defeat and should have led before the break.
