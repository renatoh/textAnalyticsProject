The chart shows how some councils have speeded up their assessment of children with special educational needs; in the jargon, a \"statement\" gets a kid on the track where, in theory, they and their parents get extra help. It is a measure admittedly relevant only to a smallish section of the population, limited too, since a statement does not guarantee resources or administrative competence. A third of English councils still do not manage to prepare the statement inside 18 weeks. If your council is one of them, your councillors and MP should be prodded. Still, it is a start. Thanks to the audit commission we know how long it takes councils to repair their housing, and how long it takes the police to get to the scene of an accident. Such measurements are not always self-evident. Zipping through city traffic is hazardous so maybe minimising police response time is not an unalloyed good thing. People form their impressions of government competence subjectively, so such rational performance measures have limited political worth. They are fashionable, however. Margaret Thatcher's 1982 financial management initiative set the ball rolling, and Labour has kicked it hard. Measures have proliferated, and last week the Treasury put out a new \"framework for performance information\" to bring together the mass of statistical and qualitative assessments of what the various bits of the state accomplish.* Labour is mighty fond of targets. To its manifesto commitments have been added ad hoc promises, including the prime minister's gargantuan commitment to abolish child poverty. Councils operate the \"best value\" regime, meant to ensure that they are efficient and effective; but they are now also being given \"public service agreements\" (PSAs) specifying their outputs in detail. The inverted commas are necessary because the public at large remains in blissful ignorance of much of this, preferring to rely on excited media reports and the evidence of its own eyes and ears as it contemplates local libraries or applies for parking permits. The Treasury's PSAs were meant to drive the amounts of money departments were given in the 2000 spending review, but Labour's panic over health put paid to that - Tony Blair announced a huge increase for the NHS regardless of performance measures. Critics do not like the PSAs' false precision. Specifying the state's outputs is tricky. The Department of Trade and Industry rejected a PSA which said it should try to minimise the rate of failure among small businesses on the grounds that a high \"churn rate\" - lots of bankruptcy and lots of start-ups - is actually a sign of economic health. Labour used to be keen on \"sustainable development\" and promised to cut road traffic. The commitment is supposed to join up with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' PSA for increasing rail use by 50% from 2000 to 2010. Everyone would drink to that, but then came Hatfield and the horrible problem of what to do with a failing private company, Railtrack. That is Labour's delivery problem. Ministers can speechify, and civil servants and policy advisers can wonk, but it is somebody else (council, agency, private company) which produces the service on which the public depends. The national audit office found that 82% of Whitehall departments said that they thought it very difficult to encourage service providers to meet targets. \"Obtaining leverage was a particular challenge where services were delivered by bodies outside central government.\" In other words, government is a much disarticulated thing in which the centre's capacity to secure local outcomes is strictly limited. But woe betide ministers who cannot guarantee that people get equal treatment wherever they live. The Blair government is often accused of control-freakery and centralisation, so the latest report from Geoff Mulgan and colleagues in the performance and innovation unit is especially telling.** How far, they ask, can you leave crime, child support, cancer treatment and so on to local managers and politicians? They do not provide a neat answer to the question of how much to control from the centre. Some central initiatives work. Their key example is the literacy hour, introduced in primary schools in September 1998, insisting that whole classes worked on the same books, together with guided reading and writing in small groups. It was linked with the target that by 2002, 80% of all 11-year-olds would achieve the expected standard for their age. Achievement in 1996 was 57%. A lot of planning went into the scheme and extra support was given to schools in the shape of 300 \"literacy consultants\" to deliver training; the Department for Education and Employment prepared prescriptive teaching material. The annual national results and Ofsted's evaluations show that the literacy hour is working. Standards are up and the government is on track to achieve its 2002 target. The biggest impact so far has been on standards of reading. There are those who say that ultimately what mattered was that the primary schools got more money, but no one denies that without the initiative progress would have been slower. Government can and should be more rationally organised, and performance measurement can give public servants incentives and discipline. Yet there is something missing from the analysis, and that is politics. Look at those Tory election posters telling the public that they have paid taxes but not got the services. Success in delivering Labour's vaunted increases in spending is going to define a second Blair term. Unless public perceptions change, and soon, all the performance data in the world will not change its political fate. *www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/performance_info **Better policy delivery and design, a discussion paper: www.cabinet-office.gov.uk david.walker@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
