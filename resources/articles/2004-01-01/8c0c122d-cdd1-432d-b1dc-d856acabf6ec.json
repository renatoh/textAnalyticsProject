At the Sydney launch of this weekend's world sevens, the federation's Australian chairman, Colin Love, hinted at a 10-team tournament alongside a secondary competition for the emerging nations. His deputy, the Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay, said the tournament \"could be the biggest event in rugby league history\". A decision is expected at Monday's federation meeting in Sydney to award the tournament to Australia to coincide with rugby league's centenary there. The federation will also discuss a New Zealand proposal to host at least one of this autumn's Tri-series matches. \"The New Zealanders feel pretty strongly about it,\" said the RFL's executive chairman and British representative, Richard Lewis. \"I am prepared to listen when I go over there.\" Hull KR could be refused admission to the Super League even if they win this year's National League One grand final. Monday's academy management meeting has the power to ban them from all junior competition for two years after a late withdrawal from this season's under-21 competition. As Super League demands each team field at least one junior side, an RFL spokesman admitted it could theoretically mean Rovers' exclusion. But Hull KR's director of rugby, Phil Lowe, said it \"had been blown up out of all proportion\". Rovers must put their case to the RFL this week. St Helens will play a testimonial friendly with Widnes on February 12 for the long-serving Chris Joynt, who has stood down as captain. His replacement will be named today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
