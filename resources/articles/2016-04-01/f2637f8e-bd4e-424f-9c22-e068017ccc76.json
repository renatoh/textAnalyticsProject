Not a great week", "bodyText": "The report published by the Guardian on Blairmore Holdings Inc landed on Monday afternoon: David Cameron\u2019s father had run an offshore fund that for three decades avoided paying tax in Britain by hiring a small army of Bahamas residents \u2013 including a part-time bishop \u2013 to sign its paperwork. In Downing Street, the initial response was lofty and dismissive. A spokeswoman for the prime minister lazily swatted questions away, referring to a story four years ago that revealed the existence of the investment fund. \u201cMost of you seem to be aware that that story was written in 2012 and we responded at the time. I don\u2019t have anything to add to that,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Asked whether the Cameron family still had any money invested in the fund, she responded: \u201cThat is a private matter.\u201d Not any more, it isn\u2019t. The world now knows all about the Blairmore shares held, quite legally, by Cameron and his wife Samantha, which were finally sold in January 2010. But the wider fallout from a week that began with stonewalling and worked its way to full disclosure via prevarication and partial explanation remains to be seen. Right now, the starring role of Blairmore in the Panama Papers appears to have dented the credibility of a prime minister who now faces the battle of his political career to ensure the continued membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union. Yesterday, speaking to the Conservative spring forum, Cameron wryly observed that it was \u201cnot a good week\u201d. It was, as he knew, an understatement. Rarely has the \u201cestablishment\u201d looked more, well, establishment-like. As thousands of employees at the Port Talbot steel works pleaded for their livelihoods after being left to the mercies of global competition, the Panama Papers revealed the squalid manoeuvres of a monied class devoted to stashing away their cash in sunny places well away from the taxman\u2019s reach. And yet it is the British establishment \u2013 most particularly the prime minister \u2013 that is asking the country to put their faith in their judgment and stay in the EU. \u201cThis walks straight into every Eurosceptic\u2019s dream,\u201d Matthew Parris, the former Tory MP, wrote in the Times, \u201cEvery swivel-eyed populist loon, every crazy Corbynite, every \u2018they\u2019re all in it together\u2019 pub bore, will be hugging themselves this weekend. This tax story may be minor, it may be overblown, it may be unfair on David Cameron. But it is very, very dangerous.\u201d Downing Street\u2019s refusal to discuss Blairmore was never likely to hold in the febrile atmosphere created by the disclosure of the Panama Papers \u2013 an unprecedented leak of 11.5 million files from the database of the world\u2019s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca, to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). It was on Friday morning \u2013 five days after questions first began to be raised about whether the prime minister had ever benefited, or would in future benefit, from the trust set up by his late father Ian \u2013 that Cameron and his aides decided he had no option but to give the kind of detail the media was after. Insiders claim that it was on seeing his father\u2019s picture featuring again and again on the television evening news channels that the prime minister felt he had to try to bring the saga to an end through a frank interview. Some believe that as attention was also falling on the financial affairs of his chancellor, and favoured successor, it was considered wise to cause a distraction. Whatever the truth, Cameron belatedly thought strategically and decided to take action. An interview had already been arranged with Robert Peston, the political editor of ITV News, for Friday afternoon, during which the prime minister had planned to talk about the importance to young people of Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU. That theme was pushed aside to deal with the questions about Blairmore Holdings Inc, (a shift of emphasis that felt ominous to many Remain campaigners). \u201cOf course I did own stocks and shares in the past \u2013 quite naturally, because my father was a stockbroker,\u201d Cameron told Peston. \u201cI sold them all in 2010, because if I was going to become prime minister I didn\u2019t want anyone to say you have other agendas, vested interests. Samantha and I have a joint account. We owned 5,000 units in Blairmore Investment Trust, which we sold in January 2010. That was worth something like \u00a330,000\u2026 I paid income tax on the dividends.\u201d But if the prime minister thought that the interview would, or could, put an end to the matter, he was wrong. Cameron must account for himself in parliament, insisted Labour. The Labour MP John Mann even called for Cameron\u2019s resignation. Jeremy Corbyn demanded he give a \u201cfull account of all his private financial dealings\u201d. Newspapers pored over the finances of the wider Cameron clan, showing to the world just how very different he was from the rest of us. The images of David and Samantha enjoying a beer during an Easter break in Lanzarote were swiftly overshadowed in the public consciousness by screaming headlines such as at that published in yesterday\u2019s Daily Mail: \u201cCameron Inc \u2013 The father with the \u00a320m property empire, the step-father with a 20,000-acre estate and the mother who founded a \u00a330m company... You thought Dave and Sam were super-rich, now meet the rest of the family!\u201d Yet more damage limitation was required from a chastened PM. A precedent had to be set. \u201cI know I should have handled this better,\u201d the prime minister told yesterday\u2019s spring forum. \u201cI could have handled this better. I know there are lessons to learn and I will learn them. And don\u2019t blame No 10 Downing Street, or nameless advisers \u2013 blame me. And I will learn the lessons.\u201d Cameron added he had been \u201cvery angry about what people were saying about my dad\u201d. \u201cI love my dad. I miss him every day,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a wonderful father and I\u2019m very proud of everything he did. \u201cBut I mustn\u2019t let that cloud the picture. And the facts are these. The facts are I bought shares in a unit trust, shares that are like any other sorts of shares, and paid tax on them in exactly the same way. I sold those shares \u2013 in fact, I sold all the shares that I owned on becoming prime minister. \u201cAnd later on I\u2019ll be publishing the information that goes into my tax return, not just for this year but for years gone past because I want to be completely transparent and open about these things. I\u2019ll be the first prime minister, the first leader of a major political party, to do that. But I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d The published tax figures may finally put this chapter to bed. Many fear, though, that it may be too little, too late. The Tory MP Mark Pritchard recognises the tactics being deployed by campaigners for the UK to leave the EU. \u201cSome Brexit campaigners do think if you damage Cameron you will also damage the Remain campaign,\u201d he admitted. \u201c[But] it is a rather binary and polarised view of politics, which is thankfully both an inaccurate assessment and one of their strategic weaknesses.\u201d Maybe. Cameron\u2019s worst critics will admit that his great strength as prime minister has always been that the public finds him convincing, decent, trustworthy, competent. He has consistently polled better than his party and, indeed, anyone in it. In making the case for EU membership those are precisely the qualities he needs to exude in the weeks ahead, pollsters suggest. Yet he suddenly looks weakened, and, for a time at least, somewhat diminished; which is a problem not just for Conservatives but for all those who want the UK to remain in the European Union. \u201cThis has profound effects on domestic politics in that it is very good news for Jeremy,\u201d one senior Labour MP said last week. \u201cBut for those of us who want to stay in the EU and are relying on Cameron to carry the torch, it could be completely bloody fatal.\u201d At no point was the damage to the prime minister more apparent, perhaps, than on Thursday, during a visit to Exeter University to try to talk young people round to backing EU membership. Refusing to take questions from the assembled media, who had one thing on their mind, Cameron opened the discussion for questions and a student threw back at him the question of his tax affairs. \u201cI am very interested in what the collective EU states could do to combat tax avoidance \u2013 something you have personal experience of,\u201d the student said with a twinkle in his eye. The comedian Jimmy Carr, whom Cameron had condemned as \u201cmorally wrong\u201d in 2012 for his use of aggressive tax avoidance schemes, tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep it classy. It would be \u2018morally wrong\u2019 and \u2018hypocrytical\u2019 [sic] to comment on another individual\u2019s tax affairs.\u201d Harsh words, and personal attacks, politicians can take. When the public starts to laugh and mock, the rot on a political career may well have set in. Soon after the publication of the Panama Papers, a YouGov poll published last week suggested an extraordinary turnaround in sentiment among the general public: Cameron\u2019s approval rating had fallen below Corbyn\u2019s for the first time. Just 34% cent of voters had responded that the prime minister was doing a good job, while 58% felt he was not. Only 30% approved of the job Corbyn was doing, but 52% disapproved. On net scores, Corbyn had nudged ahead by one of his whiskers. Tomorrow, Labour will call for a series of actions to rebuild trust, including a public inquiry into the revelations in the Panama Papers, a change in the register of MPs\u2019 interests to include details that the prime minister had been able to leave out of his records, and a set of minimum standards for crown dependencies and overseas territories. Next month, Cameron will host an international anti-corruption summit which gives him a much-needed opportunity to take back some high moral ground. The global fallout from the Panama Papers will rumble on for a long time yet. But no other country has quite such a pressing date with destiny as Britain. Former Labour MP Ian Davidson, who is the party\u2019s coordinator for the Vote Leave campaign, believes the most significant impact of last week\u2019s drama could be witnessed on 23 June. \u201cThis is a referendum on Dave\u2019s deal on the EU,\u201d said Davidson, who was MP for Glasgow South West until the general election in 2015. \u201cCameron came back saying he had achieved something and it all fell apart. It is very much a vote about him and if he loses this referendum he will have to resign. \u201cIt will be the end for Osborne too,\u201d Davidson added. \u201cThis is a vote on the future of both of them. Why would you trust a man about the European Union if you can\u2019t trust him on his own tax affairs?\u201d How the prime minister\u2019s position changed MONDAY So, is Cameron family money still invested in Blairmore Holdings, the offshore fund set up by the prime minister\u2019s father, which appears in the Panama Papers? \u201cThat is a private matter\u201d says a spokeswoman for David Cameron TUESDAY The media persist. Pressed by Sky News\u2019s Faisal IslamCameron begins to open up. \u201cI have no shares, no offshore trusts, no offshore funds, nothing like that. And so that, I think, is a very clear description\u201d Not quite clear enough, though. Downing Street issues a statement later that day: \u201cTo be clear, the prime minister, his wife and their children do not benefit from any offshore funds. The prime minister owns no shares. As has been previously reported, Mrs Cameron owns a small number of shares connected to her father\u2019s land, which she declares on her tax return\u201d WEDNESDAY Cameron\u2019s spokesman issues a further clarification which raises an obvious question. \u201cThere are no offshore funds/trusts which the prime minister, Mrs Cameron or their children will benefit from in the future\u201d Did they benefit in the past, though? THURSDAY Cameron tells the full story to Robert Peston of ITV News: \u201cWe owned 5,000 units in Blairmore Investment Trust, which we sold in January 2010\u201d The shares were sold for \u00a331,500. SATURDAY Addressing the Tories\u2019 spring forum, the prime minister admits it has \u201cnot been a great week\u201d He goes on to take full responsibility for a week of botched answers and explanations: \u201cI know that I should have handled this better, I could have handled this better. \u201cI know there are lessons to learn and I will learn them. \u201cAnd don\u2019t blame No 10 Downing Street or nameless advisers, blame me. And I will learn the lessons\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
