The play Cue Deadly, opening tonight at London's Riverside Studios and starring Daniela Nardini, aims to bring them together by translating film noir into theatre. Nicholas Blincoe has written a contemporary thriller screenplay that is translated into live performance, jump cuts and all. Even the lighting is by cinematographer Brian Tufano, who worked on Trainspotting and Shallow Grave. On paper, it sounds a bit like the noirish 1980s Broadway musical, City of Angels. But the symbiotic relationship between cinema and theatre is something that dates back nearly a century - at least to 1911, when a Berlin revue was introduced by a light-hearted film sequence. It has been a long and somewhat tempestuous love affair between the two media. Now it looks likely to turn into a full-scale and busily productive marriage. The interaction between film and theatre, which we now take for granted, was pioneered in Germany in the heady days of the Weimar Republic. The great director Erwin Piscator used film in 1927 in Ernst Toller's Hoppla, Wir Leben!, claiming it would depict the relation between the individual and society. And Bertolt Brecht was not slow to pick up on Piscator's ideas: \"Film,\" he wrote in a 1936 essay on German drama, \"was a new gigantic actor that helped to narrate events.\" He went on to point out that \"documents, figures, statistics\" could be part of the scenic background - exactly the technique used by Joan Littlewood in Oh, What a Lovely War! and Nicholas Kent in the current Justifying War. Brecht added that \"simultaneous events in different places could be shown together\", a device used in countless modern operas and plays from Zimmermann's Die Soldaten to the recent adaptation of Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, with its filmic vision of the subcontinent's post-independence riots, shootings and coups. But film is not just part of the visual texture of theatre. It has also had a huge influence on the structure of modern drama. Brecht, in defining epic theatre, uses the cinematic term \"montage.\" And modern writers are far more likely to be influenced by the filmic juxtaposition of images and ideas than the old Aristotelian principles of unity. You could argue that this dates back to Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, which anticipates modern cinema by rapidly cross-cutting between a drily authoritarian Rome and a gaudily hedonistic Egypt. Yet modern drama, too, is littered with examples of plays that owe more to cinematic montage than to organic development of a single situation: David Hare and Howard Brenton's Pravda, Caryl Churchill's Serious Money, David Edgar's Destiny. Owen McCafferty's outstanding play about a day in the life of Belfast was even called Scenes from the Big Picture. Purists may regret this interaction between film and theatre, and argue nostalgically for the integrity of form. In the end, though, it is pointless to erect artificial, impenetrable barriers between the two. Writers, directors and actors work in both mediums. And the young audience that theatre is desperate to recapture is highly cinema-literate. I can easily envisage a future where the two media intermingle: not only where theatre relies heavily on video and film, but where a night at the cinema incorporates live entertainment. It certainly used to happen at New York's Radio City Music Hall, where the movie was prefaced by the high-kicking Rockettes. You don't even have to look too far into the future. Already theatre is haunted by the themes and techniques of cinema, often with intriguing results. In 1996 David Farr wrote and co-directed a fascinating piece called Max Klapper: A Life in Pictures, staged at the Electric Cinema in Portobello Road. Described as \"a play with film\", it told the story of a reclusive failed movie director sought out by a journalist. What made it special was that it re-created Klapper's final film, The Beautiful People, on the Electric Cinema screen. Film offered a psychological clue rather than being used as historical background. The idea was later developed by Matthew Warchus in an RSC Hamlet that began with home-movie footage of the young prince romping in the snow with his revered father. For sheer technical wizardry and outrageous fun, however, I've seen nothing to beat a Catalan show, Blinded by Love, which came to the Edinburgh festival in 1997. It blurred the boundaries between film and theatre to the point of erasing them. On screen we watched a ludicrous, sub-Almod\u00f3var movie. Mayhem then erupted in the auditorium with, among other things, a Mrs Merton lookalike claiming she was being touched up in the rear stalls. The most astonishing coup came when the film's characters burst through the screen and swept up the \"live\" protesters into their own drama. Illusion and reality, art and life hilariously and breathtakingly became one. The good and bad sides of the theatre-film symbiosis are nowhere better seen than in the work of playwright and director Terry Johnson. His stage adaptation of The Graduate, although making pots of money, struck me as a totally needless piece of theatre, an earthbound version of a mythic movie. In contrast, his Hitchcock Blonde showed how theatre could imaginatively re-create the tone and texture of movies. The key confrontation between William Hootkins's sexually inhibited Hitch and Rosamund Pike's sensuous Blonde depended on the peculiar electricity of live performance, yet the play itself faithfully captured the ghoulish, eerie romanticism of a Hitchcock movie. I'm not suggesting that all drama has to feed off cinema parasitically. We too often forget that theatre is a vast rambling mansion containing a multitude of rooms and possibilities, that there is scope for the textual and the physical - Ibsen as well as Frantic Assembly. But our lives are shaped and echoed by what we see on the screen - a point brilliantly made in Paul Auster's novel The Book of Illusions, where the writer-hero finds shards of his own experience in the lost oeuvre of a silent-movie director. Given the prevalence of film culture and the technical sophistication of modern video and cinema's capacity to embody our dreams, it would be folly for theatre to turn its back on the movies. For much of the past century the two media have been fractious bedfellows. In the future, whether we like it or not, I suspect they will not only marry but noisily procreate. \u00b7 Cue Deadly is at the Riverside Studios, London W6, until December 6.
