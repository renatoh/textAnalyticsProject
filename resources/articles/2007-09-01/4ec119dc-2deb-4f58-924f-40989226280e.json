Five games into their post-relegation campaign, Aidy Boothroyd's men sit top of the Championship and, although only eight points separate them from the relegation zone, they will take some shifting. Results at such an early stage may appear trivial - victory for Southampton would have seen them jump 14 places to fifth - but the manner of this win will do little to dim Boothroyd's belief that his side are well equipped for an instant return to the top division. \"Absolutely nothing,\" was the manager's response when asked what it meant to have hit the summit, but his self-depreciation served merely to highlight Watford's resolve. That was tested to the limit by a Southampton team who were leading with 10 minutes to go at a ground where they have only ever won once in the league, 19 years ago. Goals from Grzegorz Rasiak and Nathan Dyer had put them on the verge of a famous victory but Darius Henderson, on as a substitute, scored twice late on to steal away the points. \"I was lost for words at the end because I wanted to go and tear a strip off of them for getting us in that position,\" said Boothroyd, who introduced Henderson midway through the second half. \"Darius said to me, 'Gaffer, you never learn, do you. When I play we win.' I can't argue with him now.\" Henderson came close to leaving Vicarage Road in the summer but eventually signed a three-year contract extension on improved terms. That Watford were able to offer the striker a bumper new deal is largely down to the Premier League's parachute payments; a luxury that no longer benefits Southampton, relegated in 2005. \"Watford will be one of the favourites for promotion,\" said Southampton's manager, George Burley. \"You look at the squad and how they've been able to strengthen - \u00a33.25m for Nathan Ellington - and they will be there or thereabouts. That's what gives me optimism: coming here, no fears and deserving something out of the game. I've had to build a squad without the parachute money but on today's performance I don't think we've got anything to fear.\" Since taking over in December 2005 Burley has sold - either by choice or financial necessity - \u00a325m worth of talent. Coincidentally, his first match in charge was away at Watford on Boxing Day and from the 16-man squad he selected that day only Dyer has survived. Antti Niemi, Nigel Quashie, Theo Walcott, Gareth Bale, Chris Baird and Kenwyne Jones have departed, yet arguably Burley's most prized asset remains at St Mary's. \"Nathan had an outstanding game, he was a threat all afternoon,\" he said of Dyer, who was part of the academy intake that included Walcott and Bale, but the 19-year-old winger has yet to be lured away from the south coast. His performance here, though, suggested it is only a matter of time. After switching flanks with Andrew Surman early on, Dyer gave Watford's right-back Lloyd Doyley a torrid afternoon. On the stroke of half-time his pinpoint through ball sliced open the home defence, allowing Rasiak to poke past Mart Poom and equalise Danny Shittu's 42nd-minute opening goal. By this point Watford would have been out of sight were it not for Kelvin Davis in the visiting goal, but Southampton carried their momentum into the second half and took the lead when Dyer received Bradley Wright-Phillips' pass, opened his body and curled a sumptuous effort beyond Poom. If Southampton harbour any hopes of joining the elite come May, though, Burley must shore up his porous defence. On 81 minutes, the ease with which Tommy Smith supplied Lloyd Doyley, who centred for Henderson to crash home, was alarming. Two minutes into stoppage-time Jhon Viafara could only clear Adam Johnson's free-kick as far as Gavin Mahon and, when Wayne Thomas failed to deal with the resultant shot, Henderson pounced for the winner and his fifth goal in three games against Southampton. It was harsh on Southampton but so was last season on Watford, and they have set about bouncing back immediately.
