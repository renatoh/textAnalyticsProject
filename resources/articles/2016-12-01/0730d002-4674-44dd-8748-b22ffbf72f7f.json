Gove was sacked from the cabinet by the newly elevated Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, after a week which saw him mount his own stalled bid to be Tory leader, having previously pledged his support for Johnson. He was beaten into third place by May and Andrea Leadsom. In a BBC interview with Fern Britton, Gove said he knew the phrase \u201cdoing a Gove\u201d had become synonymous with backstabbing, and that May had been right to sack him. He and his wife, the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, had been close to the Camerons but had not had a \u201cproper conversation\u201d since the vote for Brexit, which he had decided to back on a point of principle, he said. \u201cIt was better to say to David that I couldn\u2019t support him and to go with my heart than to suppress my feelings on the matter \u2026 he thought I would either keep schtum or say, \u2018I am going to support the prime minister\u2019.\u201d Gove declined to reveal what Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support for the former London mayor\u2019s leadership bid. However, he denied reports that he had not spoken to Johnson\u2019s team before issuing a statement announcing his own bid. On the morning of that announcement, he said: \u201cI wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future. But I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. I have, therefore, decided to put my name forward for the leadership.\u201d Gove told Britton he had \u201ctried to speak to Boris but the phone rang dead when I called him, so I then spoke to his lieutenant in order to explain what we were going to do. So, no, I did definitely did try to ring Boris at the time.\u201d He said he regretted how the announcement came about. \u201cThe way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn\u2019t have done it in that way. I know that I made mistakes so there\u2019s no point in me complaining. I\u2019ve got to bear the consequences of my own actions.\u201d Gove said in his speech announcing his leadership bid that he did not want to be prime minister. \u201cI did almost everything not be a candidate for the leadership of this party,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so very reluctant because I know my limitations. Whatever charisma is, I don\u2019t have it, whatever glamour may be I don\u2019t think anyone could ever associate me with it.\u201d His own analysis of his flaws proved to be correct, Gove told Britton. \u201cI also think that, my initial instinct, that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well, most of my colleagues agreed.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen Theresa became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I\u2019d been in her shoes I would have sacked me too. So I entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. \u201cI had six years when I was a government minister, I had a chance to make a difference \u2013 I hope that I did. But nothing is forever in politics and having had the chance to serve, having had the chance to make a difference, I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes, and having made mistakes, you have to take the consequences.\u201d Gove said he was now focusing on his work on the commons committee on exiting the EU, and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect. \u201cI had a chance to argue for things that I believed in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will also have the chance, I hope, in the future to be able to argue for other things in which I believe, to make a contribution.\u201d Meanwhile, Cameron, who stepped down as MP for Witney after the referendum result, said at DePauw University in Indiana on Thursday night that the rise of populism \u201ccost me my job\u201d. Europe was \u201cpoisoning politics in my own party\u201d, he said, defending his decision to hold the referendum, though he also joked: \u201cI sleep like a baby \u2013 I wake up every hour calling for my mother\u201d. The former prime minister said many saw the vote for both Brexit and Donald Trump as a \u201cmovement of unhappiness and concern about the state of the world\u201d. \u201cI see more trouble ahead. It is not working as it was intended. Some countries have seen decades of lost growth.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
