Speaking to Spike magazine, Abramovi\u0107 said that she wasn\u2019t surprised when Jay Z said he wanted to adapt her work, but after the rapper came in to shoot the video at Pace gallery in New York, three years after The Artist is Present had been staged at MoMA, she felt the experience only benefited him. \u201cThe day before, he came to my office and I gave him an entire PowerPoint presentation and said: OK, you can help me, because I really need help to build this thing,\u201d she said, referring to the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute for the study of performance art she hopes to build to in New York. \u201cThen he just completely used me. And that wasn\u2019t fair. This is very different from Lady Gaga, for example, who has done great work for me. Just by having 45 million followers, she brought all these young kids into my public.\u201d After the video was released, some in the art world declared it \u201cthe day that performance art died\u201d, while others pointed to the history of contemporary artists working with musicians including Ai Weiwei\u2019s version of Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style and Richard Hamilton\u2019s work with the Beatles. For his video, Jay Z riffed on Abramovi\u0107\u2019s work \u2013 sitting opposite a string of celebrities including Jim Jarmusch and Adam Driver. Abramovi\u0107 said that she didn\u2019t regret the decision to work with the rapper but she said the experience would make her think again about similar projects in the future. \u201cIn the end it was only a one-way transaction. I will never do it again, that I can say. Never,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really naive in this kind of world. It was really new to me, and I had no idea that this would happen. It\u2019s so cruel, it\u2019s incredible. I will stay away from it for sure.\u201d Abramovi\u0107 is soon to arrive for two major shows in Australia where she\u2019s been described as being \u201clike the Beatles\u201d because of the reaction from her fans. This piece was amended on 20 May; the video for Picasso Baby was filmed at Pace gallery, not MoMA, and the spelling of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s name has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
