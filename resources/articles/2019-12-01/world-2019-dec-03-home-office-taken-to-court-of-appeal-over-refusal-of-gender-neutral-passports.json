Opening a challenge to the Home Office\u2019s refusal to provide gender-neutral, or \u201cX\u201d, passports to UK citizens, Kate Gallafent QC said it was a breach of their human rights. \u201cThe current passport system says [that applicants] must accept that they are either male or female,\u201d she said. The legal challenge has been brought by Christie Elan-Cane, a non-gendered activist who has campaigned on the issue for more than 25 years and given evidence to parliament about transgender equality. Elan-Cane applied for a passport in 2010. \u201cAt that point the response was that the computer would not accept it,\u201d Gallafent said. Up to 1% of the population, about 630,000 people, may not identify as male or female, Gallafent told the court. No evidence had been produced to show the refusal was based on security considerations, the court was told. Ten countries offer citizens gender-neutral travel documents. Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India, Ireland and Nepal have a third category besides male and female. A number of US states, including California, New Jersey and Oregon, issue gender-neutral driving licences and birth certificates. Standards for machine-readable passports set by the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) allow for individual states to enter M, F or X in the category indicating an individual\u2019s sex, with X standing for unspecified. More than 80 MPs signed the most recent Commons early day motion calling on the HM Passport Office and the government to make available X passports \u201cto people who do not identify with a particular gender\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is among those who have signed earlier motions of parliamentary support. Elan-Cane, 62, who was born female but began transitioning after surgery, believes individuals should be given more than the binary choice of being a man or a woman. Human Rights Watch is intervening in support of the claim. The high court rejected the claim last year but permission to appeal was granted. Critics say denying X passports to individuals whose identities are neither male nor female subjects them to a discriminatory policy, which forces them to declare an inappropriate gender. Lawyers for Elan-Cane will also argue the policy is inconsistent, as border control officers allow holders of foreign X passports to enter the country at airports and ports. Solicitors from law firm Clifford Chance as well as Kate Gallafent QC and Tom Mountford of Blackstone Chambers are working pro bono on the claim. They will argue that Elan-Cane\u2019s human rights under articles 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to private and family life and absence of discrimination \u2013 are being breached by the Home Office\u2019s passport policy. The court will be told that the Passport Office\u2019s policy is \u201dforcing a [group] already marginalised within gendered society to collude in their own oppression/invisibility through a forced and unwilling self-denial of their identity in return for issuance of a UK passport\u201d. Speaking before the hearing, Elan-Cane said: \u201cLegitimate identity is a fundamental human right but non-gendered people are treated as though we have no rights. It is unacceptable that someone who defines as neither male nor female is forced to declare an inappropriate gender in order to obtain a passport. \u201cThe UK government has consistently and consciously shown a determined unwillingness to accommodate non-gendered people\u2019s legitimate needs. We are socially invisible and we are \u2018inconvenient\u2019 in a society where so much \u2013 even the legislative system \u2013 is bound and classified in accordance to gender. The government prefers to respond to our situation as though we do not exist rather than work towards enabling our assimilation into gendered society.\u201d The Home Office has argued that issuing passports with an X marker would have widespread implications and lead to additional costs across the whole of government. It would be a disproportionate burden, it maintains, since only a few people would benefit from the change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
