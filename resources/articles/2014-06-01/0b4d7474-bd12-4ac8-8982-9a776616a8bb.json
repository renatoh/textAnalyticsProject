Having arrived in Brazil with hopes of reaching the quarter-finals \u2013 progress from the group stage was almost taken for granted \u2013 Japan have departed with only two goals and one point to show for their efforts. The fact that their elimination was confirmed at the hands of effectively Colombia\u2019s reserves, and in such emphatic fashion, rubbed salt into the wound. For Colombia, the serious business is about to start. They face Uruguay in the Maracan\u00e3 on Saturday in another mouth-watering all-South American tie and, on this evidence, Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman\u2019s side will take some stopping. P\u00e9kerman made eight changes to his line-up and Colombia still had far too much class for a toothless Japan side. It was some statement. The star of the show, though, was a man who is guaranteed to start against Uruguay and is fast emerging as one of the most talented players at this World Cup. James Rodr\u00edguez came off the bench at half-time, set up two goals for Jackson Mart\u00ednez, who was starting for the first time in Brazil, and scored a sublime late fourth, deliciously dinking the ball over Eiji Kawashima. Moments earlier Colombia had created a little history when P\u00e9kerman brought Faryd Mondrag\u00f3n on with five minutes remaining. Mondrag\u00f3n, Colombia\u2019s second-choice keeper, turned 43 on Saturday and became the oldest player ever to feature in a World Cup, breaking Roger Milla\u2019s record. There is hope for us all. P\u00e9kerman, in his typically understated way, was delighted with the outcome. The Colombia manager refused to say whether he expects Luis Su\u00e1rez to be suspended on Saturday after his biting incident against Italy, but he talked up the threat that Uruguay will pose. \u201cI know we\u2019re going to face one of the biggest most important team in South America and the world. They have a rich history, many experienced players. We know they never give up, never relax. They\u2019re a very coherent team.\u201d P\u00e9kerman also went on to describe Colombia as \u201cdifficult opponents\u201d, which feels like a huge understatement. Los Cafeteros are an absolute pleasure to watch and, it can only be imagined, a nightmare to play against. They are content to sit deep and let the opposition have the ball, lulling them into a false sense of security before breaking with alacrity. Juan Cuadrado got them up and running here with a penalty, after Yasuyuki Konno had brought down Adri\u00e1n Ramos. Japan were enjoying more possession but there was a lack of penetration to their play and they were fortunate not to concede a second when Mart\u00ednez failed to convert Ramos\u2019s cut-back. It was a bad miss and was punished three minutes later when Shinji Okazaki\u2019s twisting header, from Keisuke Honda\u2019s cross, beat David Ospina. Colombia, however, were soon back in front. Rodr\u00edguez, on for Juan Fernando Quintero, showed superb awareness to flick the ball with the outside of his boot into the path of Mart\u00ednez, who drilled home. The same two players combined for Colombia\u2019s third goal, when an exquisite reverse pass from Rodr\u00edguez released Mart\u00ednez. Showing impressive composure, Mart\u00ednez curled the ball into the far corner of the net. Rodr\u00edguez then applied the coup de grace, turning Maya Yoshida one way and then the other before delightfully lifting the ball over Kawashima By that point Japan\u2019s fate had long been sealed, leaving Zaccheroni to reflect on a miserable tournament and the possibility that his four-year reign will soon end. \u201cI know this team could have done a lot more. We fell short and as the coach I take responsibility,\u201d the Japan manager said. \u201cNow we will go back to Japan and after that I\u2019ll speak with the management and let you know whether or not I will stay.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
