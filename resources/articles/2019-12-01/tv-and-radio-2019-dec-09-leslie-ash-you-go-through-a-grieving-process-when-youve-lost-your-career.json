We are standing at the window of her central London penthouse. \u201cThat\u2019s Charing Cross hospital. Now, see that bit sticking out on the left? That was my room, on the top floor.\u201d In 2004, Ash spent nearly three months there, recovering from the superbug methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), a variant of MRSA, perhaps watching her old life out of the window and wondering if she would ever get it back. She had contracted the infection from a different hospital, the Chelsea and Westminster \u2013 she believes from an epidural needle \u2013 after being admitted with cracked ribs, and for weeks it was unclear whether she would walk again. Her husband, the former footballer Lee Chapman, and her two sons, were warned that she might die. It must be strange to have her near-death experience perpetually hovering out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYes,\u201d she says mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shadow in the background there.\u201d \u201cShadow\u201d is an understatement, because although Ash walks well, darting around the living room in trainers or sitting as upright as a dancer on one of her enormous sofas, her ordeal, and her recovery, are never out of sight. She was 44 when she was admitted to hospital, still best recognised as the perkily luscious Debs in the BBC sitcom Men Behaving Badly. At 59, she still looks perky, but with the slightly skittish movements of a creature emerging from an unscheduled hibernation. \u201cI really feel like I\u2019ve lost 10 years out of my life,\u201d she tells me as we sit down. In the years that followed her illness, Ash underwent endless physiotherapy, pilates and workouts, and swore off alcohol, but the doctors \u201ckept upping the doses of painkillers until I actually felt like a bit of a zombie,\u201d she says. It was her son Max who told her: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re slurring!\u2019... I thought: \u2018God, this is terrible! What can I do?\u2019 When you\u2019re on those pills, they are antidepressants, you don\u2019t feel any emotion at all.\u201d So two years ago she came off all medication. With her brain firing again, she has \u201cwoken up, like a film, like a dream\u201d. The duration of the dream appears to be as hazy as the outline of Charing Cross hospital, because sometimes Ash says it lasted eight years, sometimes 10. This feeling of having been dormant seems to have embedded itself in Ash\u2019s mind as a reality rather than a metaphor, because next time she refers to the experience, she says simply: \u201cAfter I woke up \u2026\u201d And what happened after she awoke was that Ash found herself locked out of an unrecognisable industry. She had spent years broadening her range of movement, regaining her balance, waking her nerves \u2013 they grow 1mm a month, she says, giving the impression that she watched them daily. She devoted herself to her physical recovery, and wrote monologues she hoped to perform but would struggle to remember. But when she tried to find work, she was hit with a fresh and unexpected disorientation. \u201cAll doors were shut. All doors were shut.\u201d She says it twice as if they are rebounding in her face. \u201cWhen I was doing Men Behaving Badly, people were asking: \u2018Can you endorse this? Would you like this job?\u2019 I was inundated,\u201d she says. In those days, she says, if someone broke a leg during filming, the director would say: \u201cLet\u2019s shoot around it!\u201d So while she recovered, she thought, \u201cquite pretentiously, I suppose, that my career would carry on. They would just \u2018shoot around it\u2019. But in fact, I was quite amazed at how I got dropped. Completely. It was just ... it was quite suffocating,\u201d she says with a small gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rug being brought up from beneath your feet. No one wants to know you ... I thought, I have to start again.\u201d It was in this spirit of a personal reset that Ash was browsing Spotlight, the casting platform, when she noticed an ad for a trailer for a pilot for a possible show. The person who posted the advert, Elaine Sturgess, is the writer of Gin and It, a short film that Ash liked the sound of, and which the two women have now made. They got on so well, they have launched a new venture, BooksOffice, a website that allows users to vote on which unpublished or self-published books Ash and Sturgess should try to bring to the screen. They have meetups for authors and actors at the bar Ash and Chapman own in Clapham, south London \u2013 once her parents\u2019 painting and decorating shop; Michelle Collins is among those to have come along. \u201cEveryone wants content,\u201d Ash says, and of course she herself wants work, and BooksOffice can provide her with parts, and the chance to move into production or direction. All of this makes sense, but has it really been so hard to find work that she has had to devise a way to make it for herself? Did industry friends not check up on her, to make sure that she was OK? She gives a small laugh. \u201cErm. No. Not really. I can count on one hand how many people checked in. No. I was quite remote. I think a lot of people thought: \u2018Give her space to sort herself out.\u2019 And then years turned into a decade.\u201d \u201cI think it comes from me as well,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just couldn\u2019t find a way of doing it.\u201d She would phone people up and say: \u201cHi, what are you doing? Let\u2019s meet for lunch!\u201d But when she got there, she couldn\u2019t push past the pleasantries. They would say: \u201cIt was lovely to see you. You\u2019re looking really well,\u201d she says sadly. \u201cYou go through a grieving process when you\u2019ve lost your career. You know. And it can catch you at moments where you just feel like shit.\u201d Ash has recently played a small part in To Be Someone, a film inspired by the Who classic Quadrophenia, in which she starred at 18, back in the days when she was buzzing around town in her little white Mini, smoking Consulates and imagining the life that lay ahead. So why can\u2019t she get it back? During the course of the afternoon she offers at least half a dozen explanations. She still attends auditions, but is \u201ccrap at doing self-tapes\u201d, a requirement for many roles. Being older means there are fewer parts for her, while having a disability places her in two overlapping categories of discrimination. You would think that the experience of swerving death and adapting to a hugely altered body must have added to her emotional range as an actor. \u201cThat was my thought,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is a very difficult business. If you\u2019re not the whole package, they just choose someone else. It\u2019s as brutal as that.\u201d Social media may also have contributed to her exclusion, and to combat this she has joined Instagram \u201cat the grand age of 59\u201d. She has only been on it a week and already got 70 followers, she says, sounding chuffed. \u201cI\u2019m actually very proud of that.\u201d She has a vague sense that during all those dormant years no one wanted to interrupt her. Which is funny since she was so desperate for someone or something to break the spell. I can\u2019t work out whether Ash thinks people didn\u2019t know how tough her recovery was, and that\u2019s why they left her alone, or if she thinks they did know, and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t approach her. \u201cYou know what, no one likes to speak to people when they\u2019re not doing well,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re not in the limelight any more, it\u2019s true. People don\u2019t particularly care.\u201d In 2006, Ash was awarded \u00a35m compensation from the NHS for loss of earnings following her MSSA ordeal. The lawyers came up with the figure, she says, and if anything her loss has probably been greater. For years, her accountancy bill exceeded her salary. But the payout outraged parts of the media. The Daily Mail headlined with \u201cThe \u00a35m trout pout\u201d, a reference to the swelling of Ash\u2019s lips caused by fillers she had in 2002. (The News of the World coined the phrase \u201ctrout pout\u201d in her honour, but the subject is off-limits for Ash, who will only say: \u201cIt is very much in the past.\u201d) \u201cI was quite amazed \u2013 they made me feel like I\u2019d won the lottery,\u201d Ash says. \u201cI felt that was probably the reason why I wasn\u2019t working. Because I think people thought I was putting it on.\u201d There is a pause. The sun has set while we\u2019ve been chatting, and her face is harder to read in the dark. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. While Ash has made a remarkable physical recovery, there is one issue that she has never been able to fully resolve. When she contracted MSSA, she was in hospital with two broken ribs, having fallen out of bed during \u201cenergetic lovemaking\u201d with Chapman. (This was at 7am after an all-night bender.) Chapman was later arrested on suspicion of assault, but never charged. Ash\u2019s sister subsequently claimed that Ash was a victim of domestic abuse. Ash and Chapman have always denied this claim. The sisters remain estranged. Chapman, who is downstairs in the apartment while Ash and I talk, had previously been arrested in 1997, when he pursued Ash, after an argument, to the home of her Men Behaving Badly co-star Caroline Quentin. He was arrested after trying to kick down Quentin\u2019s door. Ash took out an injunction against him but they quickly reconciled, and the injunction was dropped. At the time of those incidents, Ash and Chapman\u2019s marriage was routinely described as \u201ctempestuous\u201d or \u201cturbulent\u201d. Ash doesn\u2019t like these words. She prefers passionate. \u201cPassion, passion \u2026 Absolute passion!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a person who walks out and slams the door. Always have been, always will be.\u201d She has spoken in the past about the time she chipped Chapman\u2019s teeth, when she threw a phone at him during one row. Indeed, some reviewers of her 2007 autobiography, My Life Behaving Badly, objected to the degree of responsibility she took for problems within their relationship. But Ash says now that she did so because \u201cI didn\u2019t want everyone to think about Lee being a bad person. Because, no, it takes two to argue.\u201d I can\u2019t help thinking that some people\u2019s suspicion that Ash was the victim of assault added an additional dimension to her recovery. She was suspected of suffering in silence, when silence is seen as weak or disobliging, and she was denigrated for it, her denials distrusted. And all this despite the fact that there has never been proof that an assault took place. \u201cNo!\u201d she says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing there!\u201d She and Chapman have been married for nearly 32 years. \u201cWe\u2019re growing old together,\u201d Ash says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. We\u2019re just like the same person sometimes. I know what he\u2019s thinking. I can finish his sentences. I can be somewhere, walking the dog, and suddenly he\u2019ll come running past. I\u2019ve got this sense that he\u2019s always there.\u201d I wonder how Ash feels about the #MeToo movement, which draws its strength from women speaking out and the tendency sometimes now to see a person who chooses silence as irresponsible. \u201cThat\u2019s what worries me about social media,\u201d Ash says. \u201cEveryone is in this frame of mind that they have to tell everything. With #MeToo I can understand completely about horrible things that women have gone through ... But I just don\u2019t want women to lose their empowerment.\u201d She seems to be saying that talking frankly about a violent experience can be a double-edged sword. \u201cBecause it can make women look terribly weak. And at the moment we are trying to be strong. But at the same time you don\u2019t want to let people get away with it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo therefore I do agree with the #MeToo movement. But ... people have to be careful, and make sure that stories are told the right way.\u201d She herself, she says, feels stronger now than at any point in her life. \u201cI\u2019ve found my voice the older I\u2019ve got.\u201d In the 90s, when she was filming Men Behaving Badly, she mostly sat and listened on set. \u201cI was terrified that if I said anything, they wouldn\u2019t find it funny at all.\u201d And although in her 40s, in the aftermath of the MSSA, she dreaded ageing, now that her 60s are looming, the number doesn\u2019t seem so bad. In any case, she works out four times a week, \u201cand I know I can keep my face toned\u201d. She runs her fingers down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going in certain areas. But I think you\u2019ve just got to take a deep breath,\u201d she says, exhaling heavily, \u201cand just go with it.\u201d So she isn\u2019t scared of the big number? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and immediately adds, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Because my mum died at 68. So I\u2019ve got that feeling of: \u2018Oh God, have I only got eight years? So that\u2019s a thing.\u201d Maybe her mum is on her mind, because when she goes to the bar in Clapham, which was her parents\u2019 old shop, Ash can picture her there, sitting on her stool, with a photo of Ash by the counter. \u201cI\u2019d like to live,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou know. I just don\u2019t know whether I will.\u201d Ash believes she is a better actor now \u2013 all she needs is the chance. \u201cBut I am going to do it again,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if I have to make the shows myself.\u201d For more information, visit booksoffice.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
