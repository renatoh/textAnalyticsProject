Five hours later we stumbled off Europe's longest scheduled flight to find ourselves one suitcase short at the Larnaca carousel. That meant another hour, and then another couple in the hire car, watching in bleary silence as the EU's first sunrise gradually illuminated the scrubby, undulating and disconcertingly vast Cypriot landscape. No family journey across unfamiliar territory would be complete without a furious navigational disagreement, and it was only after three of these that the receptionist at the Ayios Elias holiday village in Protaras opened the door to villa 51, ordered us not to drink the water, and left. We'd been travelling for 12 hours, bellowing for two, and some baggage handler was mincing around in my paisley beachwear for the jeering amusement of his colleagues. 'This is the best holiday ever!' announced our eldest daughter. Her verdict was based on in-villa promotional literature that promised donkey rides, face painting and nightly discos at the village's Santolino kids club, all in the company of Brits whose gilt-crested rights to travel had clogged the receptionist's passport drawer. And whose hefty, crop-haired elders - several, we later learnt enjoying a break from duty at the island's two British Forces enclaves - clogged the palm-fringed pool, pints on the go at 10.30am when our recuperative nap was interrupted by an argument over a game of Uno in villa 52. Feeble sociological trepidation dissipated with an early poolside lunch and two pints of my own. This was the last half-term of the year, and whatever awfulness our more energetic compatriots might be wreaking just up the coast in Ayia Napa, the inmates here wanted nothing more than some quiet, late-season family fun and a hire car with the wheel on the right side. Ayios Elias might be Butlins in all but name, but it came with bougainvillea, winsome tortoiseshell strays and a sun that even in the fag end of October was still fierce enough to punish the gloveless at any unshaded cashpoint. It's 14 years since I was last in Cyprus, visiting my wife Birna's late grandfather in his Limassol holiday flat. I think I enjoyed that trip more than her. Partners in economic crime, the old man and I trawled the old town for obscure bargains, returning late to alarm Birna with a 10-kilo bell-jar of capers, dried mint in a burlap sack, or idiotic centre-parted mullet haircuts. Seeking respite, she allowed me to indulge my rival passion for bullet holes and barbed wire, to the extent that one afternoon we somehow piloted our hired Daihatsu into the green line no-man's-land. Bumping through an abandoned village, we were desperately flagged down by an appalled Danish peacekeeper. 'Around the next corner is a Turkish checkpoint,' he quavered, squeezing an imaginary trigger. Cyprus joined the EU in May, comfortably the wealthiest of the new members, but also the most controversial. In April the 640,000 Greek Cypriots compre hensively rejected a Kofi Annan-sponsored peace plan, while their 88,000 Turkish counterparts across the wire endorsed it. A month later, in a small but significant act of rapprochement, the Turks kept their tellies on when Kent-dwelling Greek Cypriot Lisa Andreas stepped out on to the Eurovision stage, and awarded 'Stronger Every Minute' the first point ever exchanged between the two nations. Improbably, the pariah non-state, known internationally as the 'so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus', bolt-hole for outlaws from Kenneth Noye to Asil Nadir, had seized the moral high ground. The exit from Larnaca airport is dominated by lest-we-forget propaganda billboards, and it's generally a mistake to engage any local on the topic. For such a gracious and welcoming people, perhaps the bile-steeped enmity offers an outlet. That and their driving: a Cypriot cossets his no-claims-bonus like a taverna owner cossets his crockery. 'He has right of way,' called out our taxi driver as we barrelled towards a busy Limassol junction 14 years ago, 'but I deny him!' No need to drive, though, once we'd settled into our holiday-village routine. Poolside crosswords for the parents, crazy-golf and cat-whispering for our son, and for our two daughters the challenge of subverting the jolly Santolino Club into a hothouse of lurid, premature adolescence. We left them there at breakfast and didn't see either again until after dinner, one cackling ribald abuse at the hapless Ukrainian given charge of the Euromix Black Lace clap-alongs, the other hovering a laser-pointer across poor Yuri's groin. Cringeing down into my seat, I wondered how best to placate the glowering, tattooed fathers who would inevitably seek vengeance for their children's corruption. When a holiday last caused our children to miss a day of school, the deputy head lashed my ankles to the highest wallbar and left me hanging overnight. So this time, it seemed strategically advisable to bolt an educational component on to the trip. The resultant itinerary was an appealing surf 'n' turf combo, incorporating a three-day cruise to nearby Egypt, cradle of the Year 4 history project. As suggested by the razored Royal Yacht Britannia bows soaring above Limassol's dockside, the Serenade first tasted brine in the Fifties. Launched as the Jean Mermoz, she ferried French colonial administrators and commercial travellers from Marseilles to West Africa via Casablanca. In 1970 her public areas were boldly refitted in a style whose time has happily come again, but our adjoining cabins retained their dimly-lit post-war charisma, the panelling dark with the rich patina of half a century's handling by moist Europeans. The diminutive bunks were clearly designed for the tiny Frenchmen still so popular today, but otherwise the cabins were laid out with more intelligence than our conspicuously larger villa. For the first time we were able to pack away all our possessions, and in a space not big enough - thump, thump, howl - to swing a sister. The tiny, sloshing deck pools were bordered by broiled Big Rons with a pint or a Puzzler, but with a sizeable Swedish contingent and the inevitable Filipino stewards, the Serenade was refreshingly cosmopolitan. Out on deck that evening, with the bulbs strung from funnel to forecastle swinging gently in a warm African breeze, our voyage seemed the encapsulation of maritime romance. Shingled with moonlight, the benign sea was a happy prospect for a man whose sea legs were cruelly amputated at birth: this would be my first out-of-Channel nautical experience not endured as a porridge-faced, mumbling hermit, unhinged by malnourishment and a hallucinogenic overdose of seasickness remedies. Egypt has good reason to protect its lucrative foreign visitors, and a conscript army huge enough to do so overbearingly. We stepped down the gangplank at Port Said and into a first-world bubble, heavily guarded against any attempt to burst it. Our five-coach convoy was bookended by open trucks full of nervous squaddies, clasping AK47s with the desperate paranoia of Private Pike. The children had insisted on bringing along the balloons won during an onboard treasure hunt, and when one popped, the suited gent I'd taken to be our relief driver wheeled round, giving those of us near the front a flash of shoulder-holster and dark metal. The road to Cairo followed the Suez Canal, through Pepsi-sponsored roadblocks, past an enormity of scrubby desert scavenged by thousands of hunched, shrouded figures. 'It is only some poor peoples here,' droned our preening, Gucci-shaded guide. 'In Egypt we have more Mercedes than Germany.' We crawled into the outskirts of Cairo past fetid canals where boys were washing horses, past flobbing, one-toothed street vendors. Lunch was taken on the Nile aboard a majestically tasteless gilded gin palace, though being Ramadan there wasn't any gin, and the gyrating dancer by the buffet kept her belly to herself. To step off the coach was to run the baksheesh gauntlet. 'It's what David Beckham does to photographers,' said my son, imperiously palming away a proffered statuette, and thus rationalised, the experience became an adventure rather than a stifling infuriation. At least until we disembarked at the pyramids, where the harassment rose to a frenzy. 'English?' inquired our chief persecutor, and when our daughters betrayed us with a nod we were treated to a memorable compendium of apparently definitive catchphrases. 'Hip hip hooray!' he cried, chasing us along the Great Pyramid's eastern flank. 'Tally ho! Lovely jubbly!' At length a camel-mounted policeman trotted up to liberate us, and having done so shiftily scanned the area before stooping down with an open palm and a beseeching whisper: 'Mister, please.' For 43 centuries the Great Pyramid reigned as the world's tallest structure, surpassed only when a bold steeplejack stuck the weathervane atop Cologne cathedral's spire in 1880. Though now engulfed by urban sprawl, it remains a genuinely humbling spectacle, so much more than a sightseeing box to tick, and to march us back into the buses after only half an hour of awed craning was almost cruel. With the children still struggling to grasp the incomprehensible indulgence of Egypt's ancient rulers, it was back into the coach to confront the equally alien deprivations of their donkey-thrashing, shack-dwelling plebeian descendants. As our coach threaded through the aftermath of an appalling seven-vehicle pile-up, I pondered that if this had been the most bewildering and exhausting day of their young lives, it may also have been the most memorable. And before we could take off our shoes and tip pyramid sand wearily into the cabin sink, our cultural compasses were given a final whirl by the Serenade's farewell floorshow, wherein spangled Estonian girls touched shins to noses as they performed the limb-shaking British party anthem known to them as the hockey-croquet. Back on European soil, we explored the amphitheatres and Templar castles that clutter the south-west Cypriot coast, then hared back across to Dherenia for a twilight glimpse of Famagusta, once the island's ancient capital but since 1974 a ghost city just inside the Turkish north. (These days tourists are allowed to cross the green line at certain points, but do so in a hire car and your insurance is invalid.) To the naked eye Famagusta's high-rise skyline seems unremarkable, but peer through binoculars provided at the official visitors centre and an unsettling reality comes into focus: a tree sprouts through a window, tatters of 30-year-old laundry flutter across a street. Every barman and restaurateur we'd talked with had bemoaned a lost house, car or cousin, and scanning the glassless hulks of Famagusta's beachfront hotels it was a lot easier to understand their ranting grievance. We arrived back to find the village oddly subdued: with every responsible parent now back home doing the school run, there were just a dozen of us left for Yuri's bingo-calling swansong. The unedifying scenes that unfolded thereafter did nothing to repair the damage wrought by other family members over the week. Well, what can I say? Ouzo is a very moreish drink, and bingo is a very competitive game. Show me the man who claims he'd keep both hands unclenched and unraised when calling house, and I'll show you a liar. Although this probably wasn't the place to say so to his face.
