The man dubbed \"Comical Ali\" has been snapped up by Abu Dhabi TV as an expert commentator on his former boss Saddam Hussein, who was captured by US troops at the end of last year. In his latest appearance, al-Sahaf said he hoped Saddam's impending trial \"shall be fair, not a matter of revenge\", adding: \"The expected trial needs evidence to be submitted. Everybody talks about war crimes and the like. But the court considers facts and evidence only.\" Al-Sahaf became legendary for the outrageous lies he told during Gulf war briefings, memorably declaring to western journalists that the \"infidels\" were facing \"slaughter\" even as US tanks rolled into Baghdad. Standing on the roof of Baghdad's Palestine Hotel, and ignoring the sight of Iraqi troops running for cover on the other side of the Tigris river, al-Sahaf declared: \"Baghdad is safe. The battle is still going on. Their infidels are committing suicide by the hundreds on the gates of Baghdad. Don't believe those liars.\" But his most famous and incredible spin was his claim to reporters that the Americans would find their \"tombs\" in Baghdad, when US tanks were visible to camera crews filming his impromptu briefing. A website dedicated to some of his more fanciful claims has been inundated and nearly 1,000 T-shirts emblazoned with his face have already been sold. Al-Sahaf disappeared after the Iraqi capital fell to the US and later reports suggested he had committed suicide. He later surrendered to American troops but was released after being deemed insignificant. He settled in the United Arab Emirates and was offered a job by Abu Dhabi TV, a satellite news channel seen by millions in the Persian Gulf and abroad. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
