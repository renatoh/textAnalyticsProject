It is enough for a new entrant to the British banking scene to start advertising its wares and take custom away from the traditional players. A new entrant could be British, but that is unlikely because the only banks that could afford it, such as Barclays and HSBC, will be barred from the auction on competition grounds. So a new entrant is likely to be foreign-owned, adding to the sense that the once solid and venerable British banking industry is going the way of many other industries \u2013 out of our control. Even if Sir Richard Branson's Virgin makes a bid, his money will come from abroad. Branson is famous for offering a marketing image for other people's investments. His banking operation is unlikely to be any different. Tesco plans to use its muscle to add current accounts and mortgages to its existing mix of savings, loans and credit cards. It may revolutionise the way we bank. It has a presence on the high street, but is unlikely to offer the billions of pounds in lending the economy needs, especially to small and medium-sized businesses. This is still the preserve of the Big Four \u2013 Lloyds/Halifax, Barclays, RBS/NatWest and HSBC. City folk will ask why there is a problem with a foreign buyer \u2013 Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley are now owned by Santander of Spain, along with stablemate Abbey. A new entrant will need funds of its own and plenty of them. That kind of firepower can only be found abroad these days, from banks less exposed to the credit crunch. The UK has private equity businesses capable of bidding, but they are smaller than the US predators hovering over broken American banks. They also have little experience of banking. It could be another case of \"UK for Sale\" with all the problems that brings when industry is no longer beholden to our government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
