As a recap: Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte is running for governor in Montana After talks with Mexico this week did not result in a deal, the White House plans to move forward with tariffs against the country due to the border crisis. The tariffs would start on June 10 at a rate of 5% and increase if migration numbers do not drop \u201cdrastically.\u201d Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte filed paperwork on Thursday to run for governor of Montana in 2020, according to local news station KTVH. The campaign will be announced officially late next week in conjunction with the Republican state party convention in Helena. \u201cAfter many conversations and encouragement from Montanans across the state, Greg has filed paperwork to launch a campaign for governor,\u201d a spokesman told KTVH. The Congressman joins a field of several other Republicans vying for the seat left empty by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock whose term limit is up in 2020. Republicans running include Attorney General Tim Fox, state Sen. Al Olszewski of Kalispell and Secretary of State Corey Stapleton. No Democrats have announced a candidacy though Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney and House Minority Leader Casey Schreiner of Great Falls are rumored to be considering a run. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returned to the Supreme Court bench after surgery for cancer this year and is leaning on her colleagues for support. From the Associated Press: Since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s return in late winter from cancer surgery and broken ribs , she has regularly accepted Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 extended hand to help her down the three steps behind the Supreme Court bench when the gavel falls and court ends for the day. There\u2019s something touching about seeing the 86-year-old liberal icon and the 70-year-old conservative stalwart briefly join hands to exit the courtroom. Most people in the courtroom can\u2019t see the justices once they leave the bench, but the seats reserved for reporters offer a good view. Troops deployed to California are being tasked with painting the border wall between the US and Mexico, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said on Wednesday, in a tweet that called it \u201ca disgraceful use of government spending.\u201d Some 5,000 National Guard and active duty troops will update the wall, according to CBS, including improving its \u201caesthetic appearance\u201d by painting it and hanging concertina wire across existing barriers to prevent crossing. Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he is \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by his experience in prison, according to CNN. Three House Democrats are asking Donald Trump to reconsider his plans to speak at a Washington DC Fourth of July celebration. They said the speech \u201ccould create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense\u201d and waste taxpayer money. Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s production company has struck a multi-year deal with Spotify to produce podcasts, according to CNN. The Obamas previously struck a similar deal with Netflix. Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee is asking his Democratic rivals to join him in urging the Democratic National Committee to reconsider its refusal to hold a debate focused on climate. Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke said Wednesday that there should be a climate debate. Vice President Mike Pence said in a visit to Pennsylvania on Thursday that tariffs against Mexico will be imposed starting Monday. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on Mexico until the country does more \u201cto address the urgent humanitarian crisis at our southern border.\u201d The tariffs would start on June 10 at a rate of 5% and increase if migration numbers do not drop \u201cdrastically.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also said in a statement on Thursday tariffs will be enacted as planned. \u201cPosition has not changed, and we are still moving forward with tariffs at this time,\u201d she said. The White House is sticking to its plan despite negotiations with Mexico that have been taking place this week. Talks between the US and Mexico continued Thursday evening starting at 5:30 pm ET. Hello readers, this is Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the blog for the afternoon. Stay tuned for more updates. Donald Trump spent most of Thursday commemorating D-Day in Normandy, France \u2013 a solemn occasion to honor Americans who fought in World War II. On this staid occasion, Trump also decided to bash two of his fellow Americans, including veteran Robert Mueller, who oversaw the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Mueller was deployed to Vietnam with the Marines in 1968 and suffered a gunshot wound there. Trump received a deferment from Vietnam for bone spurs. In an interview with Fox News near the Normandy American Cemetery, where 9,000 American veterans are buried, Trump said Mueller had \u201cmade a fool out of himself\u201d last time he testified before Congress. In just 26 seconds, Trump managed to also criticized House majority leader, Nancy Pelosi, who was in Normandy with a congressional delegation commemorating the D-Day anniversary. \u201cNancy Pelosi \u2014 I call her \u2018Nervous Nancy\u2019 \u2014 Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s a disaster. She\u2019s a disaster. Let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d When asked about the president\u2019s comments, Pelosi upheld an unwritten rule about not smearing political opponents in public while abroad. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about the president while I\u2019m out of the country,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat\u2019s my principle.\u201d CNN has unearthed interviews from 2015 in which Trump\u2019s current chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, criticized policies and positions Trump touted while running for president. Kudlow told CNN in a phone interview that he supports the adminstration\u2019s current policies and said the past criticism was hypothetical. Some excerpts of what Kudlow said before taking a senior position in the Trump adminstration. This anti-immigration thing has gone way too far. For example, Donald Trump is blaming the government of Mexico several times for sending us these terrible people. First of all, the government of Mexico has nothing to do with sending us anybody. He [Trump] will destroy the dollar. Lower tariffs equals lower taxes equals growth. In the 1930s high tariffs, Smoot-Hawley tariffs, equals high taxes, equals depression. It\u2019s that simple. Too many Republicans on the campaign trail are flirting with protectionism. Trump is the worst, but he\u2019s not the only one. For further reading, the CNN audio and transcripts of the Kudlow interviews. Stacey Abrams might have lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race in November, but she has remained on the national stage in a competitive 2020 election cycle. For the Guardian, Lucia Graves spoke to Abrams about where she fits in the presidential race and what comes next for the progressive star. Until recently, she says her every waking thought revolved around the Georgia governor\u2019s race; and reconsidering her options in the wake of a loss, for her, means careful deliberation. \u201cI\u2019m shifting gears in a way that is consequential for more than just me \u2013 it\u2019s consequential for anyone I ask to support me, for anyone who gives up another job to come and work with me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to make decisions that aren\u2019t driven by satisfying one person\u2019s notion of what you should be, but by fully understanding who you will be when you decide to move forward.\u201d Michael Cohen has become something of a prison celebrity, CNN reports. He\u2019s \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by his experience at the Otisville Federal Correctional Institute in New York state, a source close to him told the network. Inmates have been asking the longtime Donald Trump lawyer for legal advice and his family has visited frequently. \u201cHe\u2019s pleasantly surprised that everyone has been very cordial and have actually been coming up offering him advice about prison life and offering him to come eat lunch with them,\u201d the source said. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer calls Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Puerto Rican disaster aid would not have happened without him - when in fact Trump resisted giving money to Puerto Rico - a \u201clie.\u201d Bernie Sanders sends his support to unionized Vox Media staffers who are on a one-day walkout today to demand a contract. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has a lot of kind words for Stacey Abrams at the DNC\u2019s African American Leadership Summit, per CNN. A potential deal to avoid tariffs would dramatically increase Mexico\u2019s immigration enforcement efforts and give the United States far more latitude to deport Central Americans seeking asylum, the Washington Post reports. All the caveats apply: The deal is not final, and there\u2019s no telling whether Donald Trump will accept it. He has threatened 5% tariffs which will take effect Monday unless Mexico acts to his satisfaction to rein in immigration. Under the agreement being discussed, Mexico would deploy up to 6,000 National Guard troops to its southern border to prevent people from entering from Guatemala. Central Americans would be required to seek asylum in the first foreign country they enter. So Guatemalan asylum seekers who make it to the US could be quickly deported to Mexico. Hondurans and Salvadorans, meanwhile, would be sent to Guatemala, itself a desperately poor country that people are fleeing. Stephen Moore, who dropped his bid for a Federal Reserve seat, says he\u2019s still angling for a job with Donald Trump. \u201cI may do something at the White House or in the campaign, but look, I already went through the Senate confirmation hassle. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that again,\u201d Moore told Fox Business Network Thursday. Moore bowed out after a series of reports by the Guardian on Moore\u2019s financial and legal issues, and a controversy over past remarks about women made by Moore in speeches and published articles. He appeared to lack support for Senate confirmation. Moore said in the Fox interview he is not looking to replace Kevin Hassett, the departing chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a job that also requires Senate confirmation. The US is considering delaying Donald Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on Mexican goods to allow talks to continue, Bloomberg News reports. Trump has said the 5% tariff will go into effect Monday unless Mexico reins in immigration. But Mexico is pushing for more time to negotiate an agreement, according to Bloomberg. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to criticize Donald Trump at Normandy earlier today, per CNN, saying she will not discuss the president while on foreign soil. Later, against a backdrop of the graves of dead American soldiers, Trump called Pelosi a \u201cdisaster\u201d and special counsel Robert Mueller a \u201cfool\u201d in a Fox News interview. Donald Trump has signed a disaster aid bill. In a tweet, he falsely claimed, \u201cPuerto Rico should love President Trump. Without me, they would have been shut out!\u201d Trump actually balked at giving Puerto Rico more money for recovery from Hurricane Maria, delaying passage of the disaster bill. The Trump administration is opening a new facility in Texas to house immigrant youth, CNN reports. The temporary shelter in Carrizo Springs, Texas, will be operated by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement. The administration said Wednesday it was cutting English classes, soccer and other recreation, and legal aid for immigrant kids held in shelters. House Democrats officially introduced a resolution Thursday to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress, the Hill reports. The pair defied subpoenas and refused to testify and turn over documents to the House Judiciary Committee. The resolution would allow committee chairman Jerry Nadler to go to court and ask a judge to enforce the subpoena for Barr to turn over special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s full unredacted report, and for McGahn to hand over documents and appear to testify. A full House vote on the resolution is expected next Tuesday. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has fired the lawyers who arranged his guilty plea, CNN reports. Attorneys Rob Kelner and Steve Anthony, said in a court filing Thursday morning that Flynn was was \u201cterminating\u201d them. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI and agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. He has not yet been sentenced after repeated delays. Rep. Richard Neal says he will introduce a resolution of disapproval to block Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico if the president goes through with his threat, the Wall Street Journal reports. Presidential hopeful Rep. Seth Moulton is proposing a review of the service records of gay and lesbian troops kicked out of the military, allowing the Pentagon to change them to honorable discharges. Before gay service members were allowed in the military, those whose sexual orientation was uncovered were given a dishonorable discharge. That makes them ineligible for some veterans\u2019 benefits. \u201cIf you were kicked out of the service because you\u2019re gay or you engaged in homosexual activity, then we are going to right that wrong. We\u2019re going to restore your discharge, upgrading it to honorable discharge if you received an other-than-honorable discharge or dishonorable discharge because of just who you are,\u201d Moulton, a combat veteran, told CNN\u2019s New Day. Department of Homeland Security officials alleged at a lunch with Senators this week that migrants are \u201crenting babies\u201d to get across the US border. Senator Chuck Grassley said DHS officials made the claim Wednesday, Politico reported. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,\u201d Grassley said. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler told Democratic leaders he may subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller in the next two weeks, Politico reports. Nadler said at the Tuesday meeting that he may issue the subpoena if Mueller does not agree to testify voluntarily. Nadler has said publicly he\u2019ll subpoena Mueller \u201cif we have to.\u201d Three House Democrats are asking Donald Trump to reconsider his plans to speak at National Mall Fourth of July celebrations. House majority leader Steny Hoyer, Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Betty McCollum sent a letter to Trump Thursday urging him to call it off, Politico reported. They said the speech \u201ccould create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense\u201d and waste taxpayer money. \u201cFor decades, the Fourth of July on the National Mall has been non-partisan and apolitical,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe respectfully call on you to look for ways to complement, not conflict with, the Fourth of July celebration, such as considering an earlier time or alternative location for your remarks.\u201d Under pressure from Donald Trump to curb immigration, Mexico has arrested two prominent organizers of migrant caravans, the LA Times reports. They arrested Ireneo Mujica, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the activist group that organized several caravans, and Cristobal Sanchez, another member of the group. They are accused of human trafficking. Pueblo Sin Fronteras called the detentions part of a \u201ccampaign of criminalization and harassment by the authorities, both Mexican and American,\u201d according to the LA Times. Donald Trump has threatened 5% tariffs on Mexican goods starting next week if the country does not take unspecified action to stop people from crossing the border into the US. Elizabeth Warren announces her campaign workers have officially unionized. The visual of Donald Trump\u2019s Fox News interview calling special counsel Robert Mueller a \u201cfool\u201d and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201cdisaster,\u201d as he speaks from Normandy with the graves of fallen soldiers as the backdrop. Ohio\u2019s House of Representatives has approved a bill that would require workers to declare their legal immigration before filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim if they\u2019re injured on the job, Ohio News Service reports. Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s production company has struck a multi-year deal with Spotify to produce podcasts, CNN reports. The former first couple are expected to appear at time on certain podcasts, though their role will be primarily in development an production. The Obamas previously struck a similar deal with Netflix. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has railed against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, will make his first Fox News appearance as a candidate for president this evening. He\u2019s set to appear on Fox News\u2019 Special Report with Bret Baier at 6pm, according to an advisory from his campaign. De Blasio has also been angling for a Fox News town hall. A new detail on how the Democratic National Committee will decide who gets into the primary debates, via Politico: they are excluding polls that ask respondents to name their favored candidate in an open-ended question, as opposed to listing the candidates\u2019 names. That seemingly obscure detail could mean Montana Gov. Steve Bullock gets shut out of the debates. Bullock appeared to have hit the threshold of earning 1% in three eligible polls. But one of them was an ABC News/Washington Post poll which was open-ended. The DNC told Politico Thursday that that poll won\u2019t count. Bullock\u2019s campaign blasted the decision. \u201cWhile Gov. Bullock was expanding Medicaid to one in ten Montanans despite a two-thirds Republican legislature, the DNC was making arbitrary rules behind closed doors,\u201d campaign manager Jenn Ridder told Politico. \u201cThe DNC\u2019s unmasking of this rule singles out the only Democratic candidate who won a Trump state \u2014 and penalizes him for doing his job.\u201d The DNC also confirmed that they will in fact count a Reuters poll that had been in question, where New York Mayor Bill de Blasio hit 1% among a sampling of all Americans, but not among registered voters. That means de Blasio has definitely qualified by getting 1% in three polls. The deadline to qualify is June 12. If more than 20 candidates make the cut, the DNC will apply tighter rules to decide who gets in. They\u2019ve set a max of 20 participating candidates. Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee is asking his Democratic rivals to join him in urging the Democratic National Committee to reconsider its refusal to hold a debate focused on climate. \u201cThe grassroots of the Democratic Party have clearly spoken in favor of a climate debate. I remain deeply disappointed that the DNC has chosen not to listen to these Democrats, and has threatened to punish candidates who would participate in an outside climate debate,\u201d Inslee said Thursday. \u201cToday, I am calling on my fellow presidential candidates to urge the DNC to reconsider its position on a climate debate. Together, we can speak to the DNC with a loud voice: We need a full-length debate on the climate crisis.\u201d The DNC said Wednesday that it would not be holding a climate debate, and Inslee said the party also threatened to exclude him from future debates if he participates in a climate debate hosted by an outside organization. Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke said Wednesday that there should be a climate debate. House Democrats are planning to vote next week to empower committees to go to court to enforce their subpoenas, CNN reports. If the measure passes, committees will be allowed to hold officials in contempt of Congress without a vote on the full House floor. The new rule will be part of a resolution to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn in contempt for their refusal to testify. Virginia\u2019s 2017 elections were an early warning signal that an anti-Trump blue wave was headed for the 2018 U.S. midterms. This year\u2019s legislative elections could offer strong clues about national trends in 2020, the Associated Press reports: Primary elections are a few weeks away and both Republicans and Democrats are in the midst of ugly battles over their respective party\u2019s identities and values. The Virginia Senate\u2019s top Democrat said his opponent is telling voters \u201cwe need to get all of these old white men out of office\u201d as an unusually high number of Democratic incumbents are being challenged by newcomers in the mold of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On the Republican side, lingering resentment over last year\u2019s vote to expand Medicaid is helping fuel unusually divisive primary contests. A wealthy Iraqi sheikh, Nahro al-Kasnazan, who promotes a hardline approach to Iran, spent 26 nights in a suite at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the Washington Post reports. The stay is estimated to have cost tens of thousands of dollars. It\u2019s an unusually long stay for a VIP guest, the longest on a list of \u201cVIP Arrivals\u201d obtained by the Post. The report explains: His long visit is an example of how Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, a popular gathering place for Republican politicians and people with government business, has become a favorite stopover for influential foreigners who have an agenda to pursue with the Trump administration. A gallery of would-be foreign leaders \u2014 including exiles and upstarts who cannot always rely on a state-to-state channel to reach Trump\u2019s government \u2014 have been gliding through the polished lobby of the Trump International Hotel since it opened in 2016. A few weeks before Kasnazan checked in, a pair of exiled Thai prime ministers spent the night. A few weeks after, a Post reporter saw a Nigerian presidential candidate holding court in the lobby. None stayed as long as Kasnazan, the leader of an order of Sufi Muslims who said he served as a paid CIA informant in the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. These visits offer proximity to Trump\u2019s political orbit \u2014 as family members, advisers and fans regularly pass through the hotel and snap selfies at the bar \u2014 while putting money into a hotel the president still owns. Donald Trump said special counsel Robert Mueller \u201csuch a fool out of himself\u201d with his public statement last week about his Russia investigation. \u201cLet me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself ... because what people don\u2019t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in an interview set to air Thursday night. Trump was referring to Mueller\u2019s suggestion that Trump was not charged with a crime because of the Justice Department\u2019s policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president, according to excerpts released by Fox. After Mueller\u2019s public statement, the Justice Department and special counsel\u2019s office issued a joint statement saying there was no conflict between Mueller\u2019s comments and Attorney General William Barr\u2019s prior remarks on the issue. In the interview taped in France ahead of a D-Day commemoration ceremony, Trump also blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cNancy Pelosi, I call her Nervous Nancy, Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Trump said, referring to the joint statement. \u201cNancy Pelosi is a disaster, ok? She\u2019s a disaster. Let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d Trump also called his threatened tariffs against Mexico a \u201cbeautiful thing.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re the piggy bank that everybody steals from and robs from, they deceive you like they\u2019ve been doing from 25 years, tariffs are a beautiful thing, it\u2019s a beautiful word if you know how to use them properly,\u201d he told Fox. The full interview is set to air Thursday night at 10pm. The Los Angeles Times tallied some votes and found that House Democrats do not have a majority supportive of impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. About one-quarter of House Democrats publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry against Trump. The paper did a full tally of the largest in the nation California delegation, which has 46 Democrats in the House. 12 support starting an impeachment inquiry. Several others are on the fence or moving closer to supporting impeachment. More than 30 California members do not currently support an impeachment inquiry. But many Democrats are leaving the door open to supporting impeachment at some point in the future, depending on how the case develops or how the political winds shift. Presidential candidate and Montana governor Steve Bullock released a plan to keep foreign money out of US elections. The proposal would add a check box to IRS and Federal Election Commission forms filled out by Super PACs, requiring them to certify under penalty of perjury that they are not using foreign money on electioneering activity. The Defense Department has contradicted Donald Trump\u2019s claim yesterday that transgender troops can\u2019t serve in the military because service members are not allowed to take drugs. \u201cThe Military Health System covers all approved medically necessary treatments and prescription medications,\u201d DOD spokeswoman Jessica Maxwell told the Washington Post. \u201cIf a service member has a hormone deficiency for any reason (such as hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, menopause, etc.), he or she would be prescribed hormones.\u201d Rev. Al Sharpton is joining the push to allow undocumented immigrants to get drivers licenses in New York, the New York Daily News reports. He said it\u2019s not \u201cjust a public safety issue \u2013 it\u2019s a civil rights concern.\u201d The bill is pending in the final weeks of the state legislative session. When asked what candidate they\u2019ll \u201cconsider\u201d voting for - meaning they can pick more than one - 53% of Democratic voters say they\u2019ll consider Joe Biden, followed by Elizabeth Warren with 40% in a new Economist/YouGov poll. Law professor Laurence Tribe is suggesting impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump regardless of whether the House will ultimately vote to impeach him or the Senate to convict and remove him from office. The House at the end of its inquiry could choose to send impeachment articles to the Senate - even if there\u2019s virtually no chance of conviction in the Republican-controlled body - or to skip impeachment and pass a sense of the House resolution condemning the president, he writes in a Washington Post op-ed: \u201cBy resolving now to pursue such a path, always keeping open the possibility that its inquiry would unexpectedly lead to the president\u2019s exoneration, the House would be doing the right thing as a constitutional matter. It would be acting consistent with its overriding obligation to establish that no president is above the law, all the while keeping an eye on the balance of political considerations without setting the dangerous precedent that there are no limits to what a corrupt president can get away with as long as he has a compliant Senate to back him. And pursuing this course would preserve for all time the tale of this uniquely troubled presidency.\u201d Lawyer George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, likes the idea. Michigan Republican John James has announced a second run for US Senate. James, an Iraq war veteran and businessman, will run against Sen. Gary Peters, the Detroit News reports. He ran last year and lost against Michigan\u2019s other Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow. Rep. Seth Moulton, a presidential candidate and combat veteran, said Donald Trump has \u201cfailed\u201d to maintain the \u201cunbreakable bonds\u201d with US allies he talked about in his D-Day speech Thursday. \u201cHe actually was fairly presidential for a change. But he talked about unbreakable bonds. It\u2019s important to remember that bonds are breakable,\u201d Moulton said on CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cKeeping up the bonds that we have built over the decades matters. And this president has failed to do that.\u201d Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron downplayed their differences over Iran at a meeting Thursday in Caen. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have differences over Iran. I don\u2019t think that the President wants to see nuclear weapons, and neither do I. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe do share the same objectives on Iran,\u201d Macron added. Trump has pulled out of a nuclear deal with Iran and tensions have ramped up with the country in recent weeks. Donald Trump said Brexit will \u201call work out,\u201d speaking to reporters alongside French president Emmanuel Macron in Caen, France. \u201cThat\u2019s really going to be between the UK and the European Union. And they\u2019re working very hard. I know they\u2019re working very hard together, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working out. But at some point, something will happen one way or the other, it\u2019ll all work out,\u201d Trump said. He said it would be \u201cvery interesting\u201d to see who will become the UK\u2019s next prime minister and called his visit there an \u201camazing period of time.\u201d Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to the veterans of D-Day at a Normandy ceremony Thursday marking the 75th anniversary of the invasion. Follow live updates from the proceedings here. Since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s return in late winter from cancer surgery and broken ribs , she has regularly accepted Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 extended hand to help her down the three steps behind the Supreme Court bench when the gavel falls and court ends for the day. The Associated Press reports: There\u2019s something touching about seeing the 86-year-old liberal icon and the 70-year-old conservative stalwart briefly join hands to exit the courtroom. Most people in the courtroom can\u2019t see the justices once they leave the bench, but the seats reserved for reporters offer a good view. Now Ginsburg and Thomas have been on the same side of the last two 5-4 decisions issued by the high court. Is this the start of something new? Actually, no. Thomas and Ginsburg have been together in 42 cases in the court\u2019s closest outcomes during Ginsburg\u2019s nearly 26 years as a justice. Those include some favoring criminal defendants, such as a 2009 case limiting the warrantless search of a vehicle following the arrest of its occupant, and last year\u2019s ruling enhancing states\u2019 ability to collect sales tax from online merchants . The two cases this term are a bit above the average of 1.6 times per term they have agreed in decisions in which there was a bare majority of five justices. The numbers are courtesy of Adam Feldman, whose Empirical Scotus website runs all kinds of interesting numbers about the court. The Ginsburg-Thomas pairing actually is more common than some of the other court odd couples. Ginsburg and Justice Samuel Alito have been part of five-justice majorities in 17 cases, or about 1.3 times a term since Alito became a justice in 2006. In the same kinds of cases, Justice Sonia Sotomayor has paired with Thomas 13 times and with Alito, just 6. It is safe to say that Ginsburg and Thomas, the longest-serving justice with nearly 28 years on the bench, are not on the verge of becoming the court\u2019s new power duo. Just last week , they sniped at each other in footnotes to opinions involving an Indiana law backed by abortion opponents that regulates the disposal of fetal remains following an abortion. Thomas said Ginsburg\u2019s opinion \u201cmakes little sense.\u201d Ginsburg wrote that Thomas\u2019 footnote \u201cdisplays more heat than light\u201d and \u201coverlooks many things.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar\u2019s mental health plan has inspired her first Iowa endorsement, the Associated Press reports: State Rep. Ruth Ann Gaines, one of Iowa\u2019s four black legislators, is the mother of a son with developmental and mental disorders. She said Klobuchar made a personal impression on her when the two exchanged ideas to improve mental health services during a one-on-one breakfast. \u201cI really like her, sincerely. She\u2019s down to earth and approachable. She\u2019s not proud or cocky,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cI could see this is a person who, if elected president, will do a great job, not only in the mental health area but primarily in listening to people and understanding their needs and then getting to work on trying to help them.\u201d And that\u2019s what Klobuchar did: Following their breakfast meeting, the Minnesota senator connected Gaines with an organization that helps parents of mentally ill children. It was a relief to Gaines, who has struggled to get her son the medical help he needs. That personal touch made the difference: Now, Gaines plans to promote Klobuchar within her northeastern Des Moines area by hosting her at one of her fundraisers and working to bring other endorsements onboard to the campaign. Klobuchar announced her campaign in February and was one of the first 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to unveil a mental health proposal, which includes an expansion in treatment facilities and local behavioral health centers as well as a national mental health awareness campaign and investments in federal research into behavioral health and addiction issues. The endorsement comes just ahead of this weekend\u2019s Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame fundraiser, the first major cattle call of the 2020 Iowa caucus season. Nineteen Democratic White House hopefuls will speak Sunday at the event, which Iowa political observers see as an opportunity to evaluate the candidates\u2019 organizational strength. Fox News host Tucker Carlson\u2019s nascent love affair with economic progressivism continues. On his show last night, Carlson quoted at length - and approvingly - from senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s new plan for \u201ceconomic patriotism.\u201d \u201cWhat if the Republican leadership here in Washington had bothered to learn the lessons of the 2016 election? What if they\u2019d cared enough to do that?\u201d he said. \u201cFor starters, Republicans in Congress would regularly be saying things like this.\u201d Without revealing its source, he then read for three minutes directly from Warren\u2019s plan - which condemns big American corporations for holding no loyalty to the US, instead shipping jobs overseas to enrich shareholders. \u201cLet\u2019s say you regularly vote Republican. Ask yourself, what part of the statement you just heard did you disagree with? Was there a single word there that seemed wrong to you? Probably not. Here\u2019s the depressing part: Nobody you voted for said that, or would ever say it,\u201d Carlson said. The latest monologue continued a trend Carlson began in January with a searing attack on unfettered market capitalism and its effects on American society. \u201cShe sounds like Donald Trump at his best,\u201d he said of Warren in the economic plan, allowing that not only was she saying the right things, but many of her \u201cpolicy prescriptions make obvious sense.\u201d The controversial host is not flipping to the liberal side, however. His argument is for a kind of right wing populism, mixing left-leaning economic policy with conservative social views. Warren, he lamented, remains a \u201crace hustling gun grabbing extremist.\u201d \u201cIn Washington, almost nobody speaks for the majority of voters. You\u2019re either a libertarian zealot controlled by the banks,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cOr worse, you\u2019re some decadent trust fund socialist who wants to ban passenger cars and give Medicaid to illegal aliens.\u201d \u201cEgregious\u201d conditions including mold and rotten food were found at four immigrant detention facilities by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general. CNN obtained the inspector general\u2019s report, based on surprise inspections last year. One facility\u2019s kitchen had open packages of raw chicken leaking blood over refrigeration units. There was also spoiled lunch meat and moldy bread in the kitchen at the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey. At Essex and at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, bathrooms had mold and peeling paint on the walls, floors and showers and \u201cunusable\u201d toilets. The news comes after figures released Wednesday showed a record surge of migrants at the border, with more than 144,000 people taken into custody in May. A separate report released last week found dangerous overcrowding and unsanitary conditions at an El Paso Border Patrol processing facility. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she doesn\u2019t want Donald Trump impeached because she\u2019d rather see him \u201cin prison,\u201d Politico reported. Pelosi, who has been resisting Democratic calls for impeachment, made the comments Tuesday night during a contentious meeting with House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,\u201d she said, Democratic sources told Politico. Nadler was pushing Pelosi to allow his committee to launch an impeachment inquiry, the second time he\u2019s made that request in recent weeks, according to the report. An increasing number of Democrats have called for impeachment, but Pelosi has steadfastly resisted. Pelosi reportedly argued at the meeting with Nadler and other Democrats that she would prefer to see Trump defeated in the 2020 election and then prosecuted for his crimes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
