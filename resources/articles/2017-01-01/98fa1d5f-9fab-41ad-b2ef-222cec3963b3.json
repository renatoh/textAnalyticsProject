The world No1 goes into the second round of the Australian Open after a nervous three-set victory against the world No93 Illya Marchenko and will be confronted on Wednesday by a combative Russian teenager with a track record of belligerence and a history of boxing, Andrey Rublev. Murray, a keen fight fan, was unaware that the 19-year-old Rublev is the son of a former amateur pugilist of the same name and, even though he is a similarly keen student of his own sport, he might not know that junior has stirred a little controversy in his short career. Two years ago at a Challenger event in Moscow, the Argentinian Renzo Olivo complained that young Rublev had been \u201cintimidating\u201d, without levelling specific allegations. He was upset that no action was taken against him. Fernando Verdasco was also upset with Rublev\u2019s behaviour when he lost against him in Barcelona earlier that year. \u201cI am surprised how rude he is for a 17-year-old,\u201d the Spaniard said at the time. \u201cHe shows little respect for his opponent.\u201d Rublev, who is mystified by the criticism, says of his boxing background: \u201cMy dad was a boxer \u2013 I was even doing boxing as well. He never pushed me but we practised sometimes also. He boxed a long, long time ago when it was not Russia but the USSR.\u201d He might reasonably be afforded the benefit of the doubt given his age, and he said in his defence: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything bad about [Verdasco], but sometimes you show your emotion.\u201d So, it could all get quite tasty in Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday. Murray said he knows \u201ca little bit\u201d about Rublev, who goes through on the back of a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-0), 6-3 win against Lu Yen-hsun. \u201cI\u2019ve never hit with him or played against him, but I\u2019ve seen him play before and he goes for it. He doesn\u2019t hold back. He hits a big ball,\u201d Murray said. He does \u2013 but not accurately enough to get him past 152 in the world yet. Still, he is only 19 and clearly has talent. Murray recalled his own teenage years and what it was like taking on the big names in his sport. \u201cI played Rafa [Nadal] here when I was 19. He was only one year older than me at the time, but he was right up at the top of the game. I played a five-set match with him on the centre court. It was one of the first times I played the top players in one of the big events, the slams. \u201cI did pretty good, played well. It gave me a lot of confidence. I remember those matches, [David] Nalbandian at Wimbledon, as well. I played a few of them when I was a teenager.\u201d Rublev says of Murray: \u201cI have watched many of his matches since I was a kid, but my favourites were Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer. Now he is the best player for the moment. If you take history, it is Federer. I cannot say what to expect because I have never played one of the top guys. It is a different level. I am not even on the ATP Tour yet.\u201d Many incidents and episodes have driven Murray to great heights in his 12 years on the circuit but, at the peak of his powers, a curious element has been added to the equation: the inspiration of failure. The world No1 might finally win this title because, in five previous finals, he has fallen short. Nobody in the modern era has lost six finals at the same slam, and Murray does not want it to be him. It might seem a strange engine for motivation, and at odds with outside perceptions, but losing four times in Australian Open finals against Djokovic \u2013 his oldest rival and the player he deposed as world No1 late last year \u2013 and once against Federer seems to have breathed life into his tennis at a venue he genuinely likes. Murray said of his 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 win against Marchenko: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was the best match, to be honest.\u201d He hit three double faults to drop serve inside the first four minutes and took a worryingly long time to find any rhythm, conceding: \u201cI didn\u2019t move that well. That\u2019s how it felt, anyway. But sometimes that can also be down to the conditions, as well. The ball\u2019s flying through the air a little bit quicker, coming on to you faster than what it was the last few days. Maybe I wasn\u2019t reacting as quickly as I would have liked.\u201d Murray explained that his tetchiness on court \u2013 several times he admonished himself for his \u201cshocking movement\u201d \u2013 did not reflect discontent, or concern about his preparation, which is invariably meticulous. \u201cI played some really good stuff in Doha, played Novak and [Tomas] Berdych, some of the best in the world, top 10 players. Sometimes in conditions like today you can feel a bit flat, energy-wise. \u201cBecause it\u2019s draining, you know you are trying to get through it, you need to encourage yourself to have more energy. The more energy you have the better you\u2019ll play and finish the match off quicker. Maybe I could have had more energy, started off more energetically. I\u2019ll try and do that the next match. \u201cToday was really hot. We practised this morning, 10.45 to 11.30, and it was really cool. I went out 20 minutes before my match and it was really hot. Then you have the temperature of the surface and you feel it for sure, especially the first time.\u201d It might be about to get a little hotter against young Rublev."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
