Set in Boyz N The Hood-era California, its three cities and substantial countryside are enormously larger than previous efforts, themselves having been overwhelmingly vast. Rich, detailed, violent and riddled with innumerable touches of humour, San Andreas gives you the impression of tooling round a living, breathing, American state circa 1992 as you play Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, drawn back to the 'hood he escaped following his mother's murder. From added character development to the absence of load times as you drive to the Chicano low-rider rhythm, this effortlessly exceeds past episodes. Nick Gillett The Getaway: Black Monday Playstation 2 The Getaway's major selling point was the swathe of digitised London you could drive and shoot your way through: Black Monday not only features slightly more of the capital, but also improved on-foot controls, less absurdly punitive car damage and yet more sinister voice acting. Courting movie-lovers with DVD-style menus, gripping plot and cinematic cut scenes, gamers may again feel a bit let down by long, less than engaging shooting missions and its overall glitchiness. Although this looks as though it might compete with GTA: San Andreas, the appearance is skin deep. NG Donkey Konga Gamecube In general, peripherals designed to make games more fun (Game Glove, Airpad, skateboard controllers, etc) just turn them into frustratingly meaningless wrestling matches with some cheap piece of plastic your gran bought you. However, in the case of Donkey Konga, the solid little barrels that pass for congas do a lot to enhance the frenetic beat-making of the game, in which you drum and clap (there's a microphone built into the drums) along to cover versions of party favourites. Though lacking the extraordinary level of polish and exhaustive detail that normally make Nintendo games stand out, this is fun and will make you look very, very silly playing the tiny plastic bongos.
