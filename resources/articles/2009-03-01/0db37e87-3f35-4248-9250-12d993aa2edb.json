It's one of those things that you can't really judge from pictures and videos, and that includes its physical presence, as well as the feeling on manipulating things using touch. Having tried it, I recommend you try it. There are not many around in the UK -- well, yesterday was the UK launch -- but if you get the chance, it is worth making an effort. Microsoft was using a shallow pool as the \"attract mode\", and the screen image looks and behaves like water, in a graphical way. Touch the surface with your finger, and it sends out realistic-looking ripples. But you can also put your whole arm across the surface, like a barrier, so there are ripples on one side and not on the other. Or you can use a book, or other object. It doesn't require skin. In fact, although the Surface is touch-driven, it doesn't actually use touch at all. It uses infra-red photography. It can \"see\" things that are still above the surface of the 30-inch screen, so if you touch it, it knows which side you're sitting. And although it does a brilliant impression of being pressure sensitive, it isn't: it just works on the fact that your finger contact area increases as you press harder. The Surface can also \"read\" small discs, like poker chips, that tell it to create particular effects. One example is a \"gravity\" disc, which makes things fall to the bottom of the screen. Turning the disc around makes \"gravity\" work in a different direction. Microsoft's Dave Brown also showed me a \"lighting\" disc, which lets you change the direction of the lighting on something. Because it uses cameras, the Surface can do a certain amount of image recognition, such as recognising pens and mobile phones. But this depends on it having a database of objects, which the Surface I tried did not have. Inside the somewhat blocky coffee table form factor, there's a 2GHz Core 2 Duo PC with 2GB of memory and an ATI X1650 graphics card running Windows Vista Business (PDF), so what you can do with the Surface depends entirely on what people write for it. There are obvious applications, such as Microsoft Virtual Earth: you start with a globe that you can rotate, and home in on your own back yard. There's a Grand Piano-type application, where you can play virtual keys. You can sort and edit photos, and use it as a media player. You can play games or gamble all your money away. Tens of millions of people already know how to write programs for the Surface, and I'm sure a few of those will come up with some brilliant applications. One thing you can't do, however, is touch-type on a virtual keyboard for email and web browsing. You have to adapt by holding your fingers just above the surface, because each touch produces a letter. If you want to do a lot of typing, it's better to use a Bluetooth keyboard. Microsoft sees potential sales in markets such as hotels, casinos, banks, mobile phone shops and other retailers, the health industries, and so on. Users include Harrah's and AT&amp;T, and Barclays has put one in its branch near Piccadilly Circus. The obvious drawbacks are finding somewhere to put it (42.5 x 27 inches, 180 or 198 pounds), and the \u00a38,500* or so price. Even at this price, a Surface would be a fabulous toy for the seriously rich, and I can imagine Premier League footballers lining up to buy them. And if the sales volume climbs, the price should come down, and one day, the rest of us might be able to afford one. And when you're not using it for computing, you can still put your coffee and biscuits on it. I know. * Price corrected from \u00a311,000, which might have meant dollars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
