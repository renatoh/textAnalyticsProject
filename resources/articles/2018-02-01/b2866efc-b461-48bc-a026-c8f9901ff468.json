When we came to Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross, the police turned it into a riot. We had no idea that so many of the marchers would suffer in various ways: job loss, forced comings-out, police bashings, family breakups. The parade has since lost its political and satirical strength. It is too commercial \u2013 large with a lot of glamour. There are very few individual entries now. A positive aspect, though, is that our community\u2019s diversity is really on display during the parade. The extraordinary number of events during the whole Mardi Gras festival are wonderful, inspirational, and such a bonus. Where to now? How are we going to mobilise our community to oppose the \u201creligious freedom\u201d issues that arose during the marriage equality debates? There are also pockets within western Sydney where our sisters and brothers are struggling with issues that we as a community encountered about 40 years ago. We need to reach out to them. I believe that transgender and intersex people experience a variety of issues to be dealt with. No doubt there are sisters and brothers among those who are held in detention like criminals at Manus Island and Nauru. \u2018The community can make a difference\u2019 Steve Warren Looking back at those momentous events on 24 June 1978 we never could have known where it would lead us. Thank goodness the actions all round on that night moved us forward to genuine law reform in our community\u2019s favour! Even though the climate has improved somewhat I can\u2019t help but think that some of those who recently stood up for marriage equality also did so under tough circumstances, when public opinion was initially against us. It shows that the community can make a difference. Sydney\u2019s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras has become a beacon for positive change! We now need to get back to those important grassroots community ties to consolidate this further. Where to now? Many things have changed for the better in Australia but we still have areas of discrimination to overcome, including transphobia and reducing suicide rates and depression and anxiety in our LGBTQI community. We mustn\u2019t forget how easy it is for rights to go backwards. This is reflected all around us internationally. Too many countries still have severe, harsh barriers to sexuality. We must stand up for them too. Our work is not over yet. The revolution continues! \u2018A celebration of our diversity, love and strength\u2019 Titi Chartay As a participant in the initial Mardi Gras in 1978 there are strong memories, powerful memories, sad memories and inspiring memories. The 1978 Mardi Gras, against so many odds and difficulties, with tenacity, humour and creativity, grew into the largest LGBTQI protest and celebration in the world. A celebration of our diversity, love and strength, a protest against ongoing injustice here in Australia and around the world. The legacy of the 78ers wasn\u2019t thwarted by violence nor the vindictive naming in the press of those arrested, leading to job loss, child custody threats, harassment etc. Where to now? I hope that young LGBTI people realise that they are not alone, that there is a community and a history that goes back to before 1978 waiting to embrace them. \u2018Mardi Gras has given hope to many young people\u2019 Robyn Plaister In 1978, we marched down Oxford Street, where all the gay bars were, and called out to those in the bars to join us: \u201cOut of the bars and into the streets!\u201d The march was in solidarity with our sisters and brothers overseas who were being discriminated against, and in particular, it was in memory of the raid made by police on Stonewall, in New York, where gay people fought back for the first time. We felt that more people, if educated about what we were protesting, and if it was done in a fun way, might join us in protest and swell our ranks. Today\u2019s Mardi Gras is not how I would have imagined it would become in terms of the politics. As a woman, I found the Mardi Gras became all about men and their sexual freedom rather than fighting the wider concerns we had originally of homophobia, sexism and racism. Many lesbians left the Mardi Gras in droves at that time and although some men tried to attract women into the organising committee, it took a while before women would be involved. The politics of educating people to think differently and not just accept heteronormativity faded. Now some of the floats take a political turn, however many are just advertising different lesbian and gay groups. The positive aspect of having Mardi Gras is that it increases our visibility and has given hope to many young or isolated lesbians and gay men who would not have seen or heard about all these groups. It has created an attitudinal change in the general public where they can see the fun side of being lesbian or gay and hopefully get educated about our concerns. Where to now? Marriage equality has been good for some people, and before that the recognition of de facto couples. For some of us who are not interested in getting married or being recognised as de facto, some of the same fights still exist, such as ensuring that there is not covert discrimination against lesbians and gay men in the workforce, in education, in health. We need to deliver appropriate services for older members of our community. There is still bullying of young gays and lesbians in schools which requires dedicated programs of education of teachers and students to stop discrimination. There needs to be more education about sexism and racism within the movement, too. \u2022 Riot premieres on ABC TV and iView on Sunday 25 February at 8:31pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
