The home of characters including Noddy, Paddington Bear and the Very Hungry Caterpillar said it was able to shrug off the recession thanks to consumers continuing to spend on children. \"The last thing you cut is what you spend on your kids,\" said Chorion's chairman, Waheed Alli. \"Noddy has been through the recession many times before. \"When things get tougher, people veer toward the things they know and love,\" he said. \"It's a lot like comfort eating.\" Chorion, which also has rights to Agatha Christie's Poirot and Miss Marple, lifted annual sales by more than a third to \u00a353.7m. Results published today show a 63% rise in earnings to \u00a314.6m. The company, taken off the stockmarket by the private equity group 3i and its managers in 2006, is optimistic about continued buoyant demand. The UK birth rate has been rising since 2001 and reached a 26-year high in 2008. That means more pester power from more pre-schoolers. \"We just have a bigger market,\" said Alli. Adults also form a growing part of the business. The Mr Men and Little Miss characters were one of the biggest drivers over the last year, thanks to exposure from TV shows in 70 countries. Rising book sales were mirrored by booming adult clothing sales. After taking the likes of Mr Messy and Little Miss Chatterbox to the US, Chorion is now selling 1m Mr Men T-shirts a month there.It took the range of adult tops into Gap first and is now expanding into more mass market stores, including Wal-mart. In the UK Chorion used a similar strategy, launching in specialist Urban Outfitters before taking the T-shirts into Tesco. \"Last year was just the mere beginning of a trend that will be played out in mass over the coming three to four years,\" says Alli. Chorion is also developing new brands, using a strategy of focusing on one a year. The latest was Olivia, a simultaneously adventurous but princess-like pig who originates from children's books. She has exceeded Chorion's expectations, enjoying DVD success in America, not least thanks to Michelle Obama being photographed reading an Olivia book to small children. After Olivia comes Octonauts, which Alli describes as \"Star-trek underwater for pre-schoolers.\" Whereas Olivia was aimed at girls, the new brand targets boys. \"We don't want to cannibalise our own market,\" says Alli."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
