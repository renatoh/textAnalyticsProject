Someone suggested a Mcdonalds and met no resistance. We found other groups in the hotel foyer displaying bottles of half finished champagne of unknown origin and joined them. Bed followed sweetly. We met for our regional debriefing at 3pm, and the meeting quickly turned to speeches. Our principal local fixer stood up and gave an eloquent unwritten speech expressing with barely contained emotion his gratitude for the presence of the observers and his hopes for the future of his country. His sentiments were echoed in speeches by our expert in Ukrainian election law, and then by a representative of the Orange party who took the floor. Peter, our regional coordinator and a local businessman, presented everyone with certificates. Bundled with these were materials given out by the Orange party representative, including ribbons and scarves. Several of the observers later criticised this hand out of Orange paraphenalia. Of course all observers will have their own political views and hopes for the result of the election, but we are required to tuck those feelings away until the mission is finished. We had completed our work at the polls but still had our reports to write up. Over our goodbye dinner in the evening I talked this through with Bohdan, my team leader. We reflected on how we had conducted ourselves throughout - how on approaching stations with our checklists we had approached the task with missionary zeal, but with care too; that we had always checked with both parties' local observers for issues and followed up any and all. More than anything we reflected on how what we had witnessed had moved us. That we had seen dozens of individuals across this fledgling democracy giving their time and complete commitment to getting the election right, learning from the past and by the book. Bohdan reflected on how the chairwoman of the last polling station - another safe Yanukovich precinct like most in this region - had hugged him following the congratulations we had expressed to her as we waited together in the cold outside the regional centre. And as we talked we realised that we had indeed been demonstrating bias. We had demonstrated repeatedly a profound tendency to side with those we met who shared our desire to see free and fair elections in Ukraine. And we found them everywhere that we visited, and they came from both sides of the political spectrum, Orange and Blue. In every station we shook hands and smiled and exchanged conspiratorial looks with the hard working chairs and committee members as we all expressed through words and deeds our common purpose. There are other regions where the struggle for democracy was more tortured, and you can no doubt read much about these in the press reports. But when we were standing outside our regional election administration centre in Odesa with a crowd of perhaps two hundred election officials amassed from numerous precincts, and news was filtering through that although Yanukovich had scored a resounding victory in this area, Yuschenko looked set to take the country, there was no air of despondency, no harsh words of splitting the country or of fears for the future. Instead, from these people of both camps, we heard talk of relief at a demoratic mission well done, and of hope for the future of Ukraine.
