The move is part of plans published tomorrow by Lord David Freud, the minister for welfare reform. Other initiatives will include a \"mobile regional task force\" to investigate every claim in high fraud areas, more asset seizures and data-matching techniques to spot patterns of fraud. There will also be \"one strike, two strike and three strike\" rules, which will see multiple offenders face a three-year benefit ban. \"Fraud and error is costing the government and the taxpayer \u00a35bn a year \u2013 this is unfair and unacceptable,\" Freud said. \"We are stepping up our efforts to catch the benefit and tax cheats who are stealing money meant for the most vulnerable in our society. \"When people are convicted we will get back the money we are owed by introducing tough punishments and stripping the assets of criminal gangs. My message to them is that benefit fraud is a crime that just doesn't pay.\" Other measures will include abolishing cautions as a penalty for fraud and introducing civil penalties of \u00a350 for minor offences. There will also be a drive to reduce error in the system. Of the \u00a35.2bn lost each year, fraud accounts for just \u00a31.5bn across benefits and tax credits. In addition, \u00a31.1bn of losses occurs from official error, and a further \u00a31.1bn from customer error. The Department for Work and Pensions is also planning to name and shame offenders in their local areas. Tomorrow it will start by releasing two examples of people found guilty of fraud. One is Sean Christopher Hill, who claimed \u00a310,000 in benefits by saying he was too sick to work. In fact, he had started working as a doorman and later became a nightclub bouncer. He was ordered to repay the money and carry out 200 hours community service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
