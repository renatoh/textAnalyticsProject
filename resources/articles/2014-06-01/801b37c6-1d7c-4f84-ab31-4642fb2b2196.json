We open with arresting images of teenagers fending for themselves on the streets of Guatemala City: feisty Juan striding through back streets, money sewn into his trousers; Sara cropping her hair and binding her breasts in a public toilet, hoping to hide her gender; Samuel scavenging for scraps on a vast rubbish heap, an emblematic snapshot of a derelict home life. Abandoned by adults, the trio embark upon a journey fraught with life-threatening danger, from jumping trains to being kidnapped, robbed and beaten by thugs and authorities alike. En route, they fall in with the Tzotzil Indian Chauk, who speaks no Spanish but is better able to understand their situation than most, his young eyes blending innocence with knowledge beyond his years. The terrifying tribulations the ramshackle group encounter are culled from the recollections of hundreds of migrants \u2013 a microcosm of a far wider human tragedy, made all the more alarming by its apparent mundanity. Yet it's the warmth and compassion of the storytelling that really strikes home. Quemada-D\u00edez meets his young charges on equal terms, viewing the world through their eyes, seeing its strange wonder even as they gaze unflinchingly at an unforgiving future. The result is at once urgent, defiant, and heartbreaking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
