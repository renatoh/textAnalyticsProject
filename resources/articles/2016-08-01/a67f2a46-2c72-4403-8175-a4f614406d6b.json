The Liberal MP Ken Wyatt, the independent senator Jacqui Lambie, and the Labor MP Linda Burney and senator Patrick Dodson will meet with the representatives and share their stories about why they support constitutional recognition. In a statement the Recognise organisation noted the 45th parliament boasted the highest number of Indigenous representatives in parliament in Australia\u2019s history, making this the moment to achieve constitutional recognition. A Recognise youth representative who is travelling to Canberra from Adelaide, Rebekka Rogers, said: \u201cI know that with constitutional recognition and the removal of racial discrimination from our constitution our country will be better and I am prepared to fight for that.\u201d Kayameshia Kells from Alice Springs said the record numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the parliament was \u201ca great source of hope and inspiration for young Indigenous people\u201d. Almost 50 years after the 1967 referendum removed two constitutional provisions discrimination against Indigenous Australians, Recognise is launching a campaign called Why I Recognise. The campaign will share 50 stories about why recognition is important, including personal messages from the Indigenous MPs. The campaign for constitutional recognition is entering a fragile period. Although support for recognition is high many delegates to the referendum council which is designing the proposal have called for recognition to be scrapped in favour of a treaty. The deadline for the constitutional recognition referendum has been pushed back until 2018 to allow for better consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Labor has said it would consider a treaty with Aboriginal Australians in addition to constitutional recognition, a proposal which led the government to accuse it of putting at risk \u201cmeaningful but modest\u201d change in the form of constitutional recognition. A Recognise spokeswoman told Guardian Australia preparations for the Why I Recognise campaign had shown that there is strong support for recognition across the Australian community, including bipartisan support for it. \u201cWhen this moves towards a referendum, multiparty support is critical,\u201d she said. A Recognise ambassador, Mark Yettica-Paulson, said the movement for constitutional change across the country was strong and almost 300,000 Australians had signed on to support the campaign. \u201cPeople from across Australia want to be part of fixing our constitution and to leave a legacy for future generations that we can all be proud of,\u201d Yettica-Paulson said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see parliamentarians from across the political spectrum come together to support the movement for constitutional change and maintain momentum. We can\u2019t leave this to the next generation. \u201cHaving tomorrow\u2019s leaders \u2013 our youth representatives \u2013 meet and share their aspirations with politicians who are making history in this new parliament is a big step forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
