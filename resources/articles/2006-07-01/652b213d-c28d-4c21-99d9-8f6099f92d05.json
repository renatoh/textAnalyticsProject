It was a pearling record, full of brio, swagger and the addictive little elements that kicked off with its first line - \"I'll tell you what I want/ what I really, really want\" - and peaked with the mysterious claim that what its authors were after was a \"zig-a-zig-ah\". Within six months, the inescapable Spice Girls were the subject of features in titles as diverse as NME and the Spectator, where they expounded the new theory of \"girl power\", summed up thus: \"It's about equality and fun and trying to rule your life.\" When more academic voices weighed in, however, the Girls were found wanting. In the view of the American feminist Jennifer Pozner, it was \"probably a fair assumption to say that a 'zig-a-zig-ah' is not Spice shorthand for 'subvert the dominant paradigm'.\" Here, it was alleged, was post-feminism revealed as a busted flush: five supposedly empowered starlets whose diminutive nicknames and push-up bras suggested patriarchal business as usual. Extending the logic of that argument, you might even charge them with responsibility for the wave of raunch culture, recently summed up in these pages as \"women's collusion in their own objectification\". You could, but you'd be wrong. The Spice Girls were shot through with absurdity and contradiction - but in context, their claim to be waging war on a testosterone-heavy consensus just about held up. Lest we forget, 1996 found pop-cultural machismo at something of a peak: the Gallagher brothers expressing the opinion that \"birds are rubbish\", the Euro 96 tournament cementing a specious relationship between football and music. And then came Wannabe, prompting the kind of talk that heralded their first appearance in the trade journal Music Week: \"Just when boys with guitars threatened to rule pop life, an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble.\" Compare them to the pop people who followed in their wake, and the sense of some almost accidental burst of joyous non-conformity gets even greater. If the non-guitar end of the pop market now seems to be dominated by vacuous drones, the Spices - not least when they fired their manager Simon Fuller in 1997, an act of quite splendid self-sabotage - looked like something close to anarchists. Back on the terrain of sexual politics, consider the absence of such contemporary promotional tics as regularly disrobing in your videos and turning in the obligatory faux-lesbian poses for the lads' magazines. In a modern context, they look almost chaste. So how did the post-Spice world go so awry? A small part of the answer is bound up with their own greed. More importantly, girl power proved to be as nothing compared to altogether stronger cultural currents, embodied by the contents of our newsstands and high-street shops. Still, for those who heard the opening bars of that song and sensed a new world, there may be a faint glimmer of hope. Writing this, I came across a copy of Germaine Greer's The Whole Woman, published in 1999, when Spice hegemony was fading fast. \"The Spice Girls did make a difference,\" she wrote, \"because their most passionate fans were eight-year-old girls.\" A study of children's oral culture had found, in the post-Spice climate, that \"whereas half the space in school playgrounds used to be taken up by a self-selecting group of boys playing football, girls' clapping and dancing games were taking over\". If those fans were eight then, they'll be coming up to 18 now. The great minds behind Zoo, Nuts and Love Island might want to take note: maybe - just maybe - something slightly more interesting might be around the corner. john.harris@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
