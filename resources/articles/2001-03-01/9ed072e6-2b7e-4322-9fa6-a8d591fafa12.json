Uefa is expected to confirm in June that the club finishing fourth in next season's Premiership will enter the Champions League qualifying round. The top two will continue to qualify automatically for the first group stage and the third-placed club will still have to play a preliminary match. Three countries are awarded four Champions League places and the likelihood is that England will replace Germany for 2002-3, joining Italy and Spain in recognition of the performances of Manchester United, Arsenal, Leeds and Liverpool in Europe this season. The decision is based on Uefa's coefficient table, which reflects the performances of a country's clubs in European competitions over the previous five seasons. Quotas are calculated a year in advance, so no matter what English clubs achieve in Europe this season only three teams will be allowed in the Champions League next term. The Football Association has launched an investigation into the crowd trouble that marred Oxford United's match against Swindon at the Manor Ground on Saturday. The Second Division derby was held up for three minutes and players shepherded to the dugouts after plastic bottles and coins were thrown, some aimed at the Swindon goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall. The referee Paul Rejer told Oxford officials he would have abandoned the match had the trouble persisted. The Romania midfielder Gheorghe Hagi has been banned for six games by the Turkish Football Federation for spitting at a referee and stamping on his feet after a disallowed Galatasaray goal in a league match last weekend. Finland's coach Antti Muurinen has named a squad including 10 British-based players for next week's World Cup qualifier against England. But Muurinen said only the Liverpool duo Jari Litmanen and Sami Hyypia were certain to start the match at Anfield tomorrow week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
