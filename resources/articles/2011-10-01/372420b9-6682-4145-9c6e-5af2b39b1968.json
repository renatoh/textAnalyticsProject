And watching Sean Holmes's powerful production, the first major revival in a quarter of a century, I was struck by the way violence threads its way through every scene. But, in the wise words of a former critic, this is \"violence as a social deformity crying for correction\" rather than the product of a cruel and absurd universe. What Bond suggests is that we have created a coarse, brutal world in which linguistic vacancy leads to moral indifference. You see that in the very first scene in which Pam brings a young man, Len, back to her south London home for no other purpose than a quick shag on the sofa. When Len asks \"Wass yer name?\" Pam's instant reply is a \"Yer ain' arf nosey.\" The logical extension of sex as a purely physical transaction is seen in the terrifying fourth scene in which Pam, by now a mother, stonily ignores her baby's cries of rage while doing her eye make-up in preparation for a new date. Everyone tends to define Bond's play by its notorious central scene in which Pam dumps her pram in the park only for a gang of youths to attack and stone the abandoned baby. It remains a horrifying scene that captures all too accurately the escalating rhythm of violence and the imaginative barrenness of youths who assume that babies are simply animals devoid of feeling. But, although that scene is still painful to watch, Bond's skill lies in showing how violence permeates domestic life: Pam and Len gradually turn into a scratchily abusive couple who seem destined to become like Pam's parents who use ostentatious silence as a form of marital revenge. You could argue that Bond underplays the element of personal responsibility. But what he pinned down so vividly in 1965 is something that seems even more true today: that if you create an unjust society, in which those at the bottom of the heap are condemned to a life of meaningless materialism, then you are simply laying up trouble for the future. What, however, gives Bond's play a tiny shred of hope is the extraordinary final scene in which Len, who for much of the action has been Pam's punchbag, meticulously mends a chair. As the title implies, this is ultimately a play about the possibility of redemption. As a piece of theatre, it also has an austere clarity that is beautifully realised in Holmes's production. Each of the 13 scenes makes its point without the underlining you sometimes get in the Brechtian model. Morgan Watkins as the gangling, tenacious Len, Lia Saville as the myopic, self-infatuated Pam and Michael Feast and Susan Brown as her parents, for whom even an evening meal is an extension of war by other means, are all impeccably right. And, among the parkside youths, Calum Callaghan stands out as the baby's presumed father whose violence only intensifies after a spell in prison. But that is part of Bond's larger point: that if we want to change humanity then we have to radically re-order the way we run society."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
