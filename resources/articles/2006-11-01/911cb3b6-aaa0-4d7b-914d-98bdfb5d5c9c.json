Do I make one, buy one, buy two or ask two children to share the opening ritual each day? Do I get one with chocolates or go for a religious theme? Is it appropriate to use an advent calendar as a bargaining tool? By the first day of Christmas all will have been resolved. I'm hoping I'll find a Victorian-style calendar to tie into our pre-Christmas curriculum. We're going to be making Victorian dioramas. When I first read that in the year 5 planning overview, I looked at a colleague: \"Dior-what?\" - and learned that it's a 3-D scene with lots of decorative painting and figures. The Victorians loved them and I'm hoping that getting the children to design advent calendars will be a step towards them loving their diorama projects. We're putting in an extra art order for a lot of pre-Christmas cardboard and glitter. In the meantime, we've been charging around the borough, averaging an hour's walk twice a week, studying Victorian architecture, visiting Victorian homes, researching old census data and competing against other schools in safely-home competitions. These would be better described as safely-swim, safely-online and safely-learn-to-drive competitions. Not only do we all learn a lot about key safety issues, we get fit in the process. One supermum who accompanies us regularly told us she only did so because it saved spending money on a gym."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
