Aggrieved parents were angry because the teacher had shattered all those childhood illusions of a jolly ho-ho-ho superhero who has apparently found a way, equipped with only a few reindeer and a flying sleigh, to bend the time-space continuum, and like a weird quantum particle, be in millions of places at once. For her transgression, the poor teacher got the sack \u2013 and not the one containing Santa's toys \u2013 which is unfair considering that she was only telling the truth. Besides, should seven or eight-year-olds continue to live in a never never land of infantile fantasy, and how many of them truly believe in Father Christmas anyway? Having grown up in a Muslim household, I never did, and many of my friends at that age either knew or suspected that it was an elaborate game of make believe. And childhood, after all is about make believe: suspending disbelief for the fun of it. An American friend says that, by the age of five, two glaring clues led him to deduce the non-existence of Santa: that it was physically impossible for him to visit every house in the world at midnight, and his workshop seemed to churn out branded toys he saw in the shops. At about the same age, an Australian friend decided Father Christmas was a hoax because he rode through suburbia on a tandem trailer and bore a striking, and sweaty, resemblance to a bloke who lived down the road. However, in a generous seasonal gesture of damage limitation, I have some good news for the kids at Blackshaw Lane primary school: Santa Claus is real and, in many ways, is far more interesting than the hyped-up, fairytale version we know today. Once upon a time (in the 3rd century), in a land far, far away (Byzantine Anatolia, to be precise), there lived a man called Nicholas (270-345) who was so saintly that the church canonised him within a century of his death \u2013 hence, \"Santa Claus\". As Bishop of Myra, his devoutness led him to use his significant inheritance to help the poor while leading a life of austerity himself. One story tells of how the goodly bishop anonymously helped an old man with the dowry for his three daughters by tossing bags of gold through their open window which landed in stockings hanging up to dry by the hearth (sound familiar?). But the man had a less pleasant and more militant side. He lived around the time when Christians, like so many other movements, were about to go from being the persecuted to becoming the persecutors. Bishop Nicholas is believed to have attended this First Ecumenical Council which stamped out competing views of the nature of Christ, such as Arianism, which held that Jesus was not of the same substance, i.e. \"consubstantial\", as God, undermining the Trinity. Like a present-day Talib destroying \"pagan\" statues of Buddha, Saint Nicholas is also attributed with razing numerous pre-Christian temples, including that of the Roman goddess Diana. Interestingly, Diana's birthday is on December 6, which later became the Saint's own day. Some historians believe this is no coincidence and was intended as a way of giving a Christian identity to an ancient festival that refused to die away \u2013 much like Christmas as a substitute for popular pagan mid-winter festivals. So, what caused Saint Nicholas to drift nearly three weeks down the calendar? Well, in Belgium and the Netherlands, \"Sinterklaas\", as it is known locally, is still celebrated on December 6, with a lot of fanfare, including the Saint's eagerly awaited arrival with his Moorish helpers from Spain, where he is believed to have lived. In England, the personification of Christmas as a jolly old man \u2013 known as Sir, Lord or Father Christmas \u2013 began in the 17th century to resist party-pooper Puritans. In fact, unlike the annual tabloid rumours of local councils prohibiting Christmas, Oliver Cromwell actually did ban the observance of the feast in 1644. The original personification of Christmas was not as a gift-bearer for children. This idea arrived in Victorian times from the United States, in whose melting pot, Saint Nicholas, brought by Dutch immigrants to New Amsterdam (now New York), was merged with the Anglo-Saxon Father Christmas. Interestingly, the Netherlands and Belgium recently reimported this tradition from the United States and now have a \"kerstman\" (the Christmas Man) on Christmas Eve, in addition to their Sinterklaas. Going even further back, Santa Claus seems to borrow heavily from pre-Christian Germanic beliefs, such as the chief Norse god Odin, who would ride at the head of a celestial hunting party. Moreover, Norse children would place their boots, filled with carrots, straw, or sugar, near the chimney for Odin's flying horse, Sleipnir, to eat. In return, they were rewarded with a gift. Santa as we know him may not be real, but the story of the man and the myth is more fascinating than a pot-bellied old man in a red suit crying out \"Ho, ho, ho\".
