A terrorist infiltrated London Marathon is the chilling opening; high-level lies, rendition to Poland and waterboarding follow. An elegant, unstoppable front runner of a spy thriller, which has been released as an audiobook a month ahead of the hardback. Carol Ann Duffy Reading From Her Poems (The Poetry Archive \u00a312.75, 1hr 9mins) Ardent love, celebration, vulnerability and agony are all here in these beautifully crafted, delicately rhyming poems. From the quiet melancholy of Duffy's voice, you know that her early glorious rapture, like the birds which \"stitch the dawn with their song \", will not last. Jane Eyre Charlotte Bront\u00eb; read by Emma Fielding (Naxos Young Adult Classics \u00a310.99, 4hrs abridged) What makes this special apart from Emma Fielding's deft narration is the bonus CD-Rom which contains the unabridged text and a study guide by Francis Gilbert. Although the guide targets \"young adults\", any intelligent reader will fi nd it stimulating. One of a series and amazingly good value."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
