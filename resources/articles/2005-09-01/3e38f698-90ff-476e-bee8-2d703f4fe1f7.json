The decision was taken by ministers of education, agriculture, fisheries and rural development at the end of a three-day conference in Ethiopia. Marcela Villarreal, who heads the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) gender and population division, said that enhancing education for people living in rural areas would help combat food shortages and poverty and was \"an important step towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\" Ministers and senior officials from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda attended the seminar, which began in Addis Ababa on Wednesday. They called on governments to promote education for rural residents as a top national priority and ensure that it was given increased budgetary allocations and investments. More than 70% of the total population in sub-Saharan Africa lives in rural areas. According to the FAO, for every 100 children living in urban areas who have access to primary education, only 68 do so in rural communities, and for every 100 children in urban areas who complete primary school, only 46 do so in rural regions. \"These inequities in education directly threaten the sustainable development of the sub-Saharan region,\" the ministers stated in their final communiqu\u00e9 from the conference. \"Food security and poverty reduction strategies are directly dependent on our capacity to foster rural children's access to quality primary education.\" They added that close collaboration was needed among the ministries of education and agriculture, the media and the public and private sectors to achieve the goals, and called on the donor community to provide additional resources for targeting education for rural people. The ministers admitted that much still needed to be done in rural areas to give girls and women access to education. In 2000, the UN agreed a set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved by 2015 to reduce poverty, improve health services and give all children access to a primary education - ensuring girls had the same rights as boys. A provisional date for gender parity was set for this year, but it is likely to be missed. Lavinia Gasperini, an education spokesman for the FAO, said: \"Because of its direct impact on all the MDGs, education for rural people will be one of the main challenges of the coming decade.\" She added: \"Some developing countries have made tremendous progress in rural poverty reduction by investing in human development and implementing relevant education programmes in rural schools and colleges.\" Next week, ministers from the UN will meet in New York to assess progress on achieving the MDGs. Earlier this week, the charity Save the Children called on world leaders to help countries abolish school fees by 2006. It said fees were a huge barrier to education in sub-Saharan countries. Abolishing them in just 13 African states would enable an extra 4.5 million children to go to school, the charity said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
