Bank, who began as a Radio 1 DJ, will be recognised at the ceremony on Monday for his success in curating Bestival \u2013 which attracts about 80,000 people \u2013 and the smaller Camp Bestival in Dorset, which he set up in 2008. In 2010, Bestival set the record for the biggest fancy dress event when 55,000 festival-goers donned fantasy-themed costumes. This year, it broke the record for creating the world\u2019s largest disco ball, rising to a challenge set by Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers. Bank said: \u201cI sort of feel like they\u2019ve chosen the wrong person. I really think the UK festival market is the best in the world. Great Britain leads the field in festivals, so to be associated with those guys is amazing. I\u2019m proud that Bestival and Camp Bestival and everything else we do is part of that.\u201d Despite the increasing success of Bestival as an independently run festival, Bank acknowledged that competing against the larger, commercially run festivals had its challenges and said the survival of the smaller boutique festival was crucial. \u201cAt the Association of Independent Festivals we have a lot of issues, not necessarily just with Live Nation or the big boys,\u201d said Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s more just a fight for our festivals to survive and competition is as much a problem as anything really. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a Live Nation festival or an independent festival, they\u2019re all up against each other. A lot of people find it frustrating and hard work but I think its just real life ... We\u2019re not getting crushed, we\u2019re just having a bit of a battle.\u201d He addressed complaints that the same musicians take up the headline slots across the festival circuit each year. It has already been announced that Metallica, who headlined Glastonbury last year, will take the main slots at this year\u2019s Reading and Leeds festivals. \u201cI think its one of the questions that always comes up and we debate it every single year,\u201d Banks said. \u201cIt is tricky because there are only so many headliners that could headline Reading ... at that top end they need to get bums on seats so I can see why you get the same headliners.\u201d Bestival\u2019s headliners in the past have included Elton John, Snoop Dogg and New Order but Bank said he had made a conscious effort to put newer musicians such as Florence and the Machine and Foals at the head of the bill in recent years. \u201cI put Foals on Saturday night at Bestival this year, because I wanted to put a younger headliner on and it went well,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were like \u2018are you sure they\u2019re big enough to headline Bestival?\u2019 But they smashed it and everyone loved it. \u201cYou know, the proof is in the pudding; if people don\u2019t turn up to the festival that will be the point at which we can\u2019t keep repeating the headliners.\u201d Bank said he had plans in the works to expand his festival operation further. \u201cWe are working on some more festivals next year and that\u2019s still the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very much about to get signed off. So yeah, watch this space. Its exciting.\u201d This year\u2019s UK Festival Awards also sees Bestival nominated for best major festival and best dance event, up against events such as Glastonbury, T in the Park and Wireless. The awards will take place on 1 December at London\u2019s Roundhouse. Bank was also honoured this year with the outstanding contribution award at the Association of Independent Festivals\u2019 event in October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
