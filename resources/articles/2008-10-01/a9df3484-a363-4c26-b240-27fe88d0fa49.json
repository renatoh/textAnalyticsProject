He is acquitted of murder. A mother drowns her daughter in the bath and is sentenced to life in prison, with a recommendation that she serve at least 15 years, despite a history of mental illness. Why the starkly different treatment of John Hogan and Joanne Hill (Joanne Hill case, September 27; No charges for Crete death father, September 30)? Could it be because a mother who kills offends our deepest instincts and is punished far more harshly than a father? Joanne Hill had suffered from serious mental health problems since she was 17. She twice attempted suicide in 2000 and was diagnosed with chronic anxiety just before the birth in 2003 of her daughter, Naomi, who suffered from cerebral palsy. After the difficult birth, she suffered severe postnatal depression. She relapsed in 2006 and went to live with her parents, still on medication. Then she started drinking heavily. Yet despite a history of mental illness for half her life, the jury at her trial rejected her defence of diminished responsibility and found her guilty of murder. Contrast this with the treatment of John Hogan, who will walk free when he returns from a psychiatric hospital in Athens, even though a UK inquest ruled that his six-year-old son Liam was unlawfully killed. A Greek court accepted he was suffering from \"an explosive psychotic episode\" in August 2006, after his wife told him she wanted a divorce. She was even blamed for choosing \"the wrong time and place\" to break up. Meanwhile, Joanne Hill, mentally ill and desperate, offended against our expectations of a mother and is locked away for life.
