The Wales winger became his country's youngest-ever international when he played against Germany in October 1991 at 17 years and 321 days. Since then, his appearances for Wales have been curtailed by periodic injury but he still has 35 caps to his name. Giggs was part of the Wales side that went down to a 2-1 defeat in their opening qualifier in Belarus before playing in successive draws against Norway and Poland. Giggs, who has scored seven goals for his country, missed the draw in Armenia before returning to the side when Wales again drew, this time against Ukraine. He then played in Wales' next four qualifiers but was unable to inspire them to any victories before missing the final game of the qualification process when Wales avenged their earlier defeat to Belarus with a 1-0 win to finish fifth in group five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
