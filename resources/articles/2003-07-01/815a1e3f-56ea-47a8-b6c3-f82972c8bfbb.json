But Wakefield is no total novice. He has played throughout Europe and South Africa, taking birdies at the final three holes for his maiden victory in the Tessali Open del Sud in Italy, and securing his European Tour card by finishing ninth in the ultra-competitive qualifying school last year. He stands 85th in the European order of merit with earnings of \u00a3110,000, and such illustrious names as Lee Westwood, Sergio Garcia, Sandy Lyle and Michael Campbell are below him. But for him this is the \"real McCoy\". \"It's so difficult to take in -the sheer size of the event,\" he said. \"I was at Muirfield last year and Royal Lytham the year before as a spectator and found the atmosphere electric. Being here as a player is something you hope for.\" Wakefield, who had completed his practice and was heading for his digs in Maidstone before the thunder and lighting arrived yesterday, said the last occasion he had a bout of \"first-tee\" nerves was at this year's Benson &amp; Hedges at the Belfry. \"It was really my first appearance in a big tournament and thankfully I had to tee off at the 10th hole,\" he said. \"It was an early start, there was no crowd and I smacked a six-iron down the fairway. But even then I was a bundle of nerves. I would have been shaking like a leaf had I started at the first. \"I just hope that I can keep my cool and hit the ball down the middle tomorrow. After that I will just do my best; try and maintain total concentration and not get too far ahead of myself if things start to go well.\" And what would he do to try and stay calm? \"I've just thought about that,\" he said with a smile. \"I'm an ardent fan of Port Vale; perhaps if I talk to my caddie about them when the excitement is mounting that will be beneficial. It will confuse him but maybe keep my feet on the ground.\" While Wakefield was the best known of those who came through qualifying, Charles Challen was the least. In the players' guide in the massive media centre there were scant details; little more than his age, height and place of birth. What it could have said was that, arguably, he had had the most nerve-racking ride to the Open, securing his place via the regional and then final qualifying after a play-off at Royal Cinque Ports. \"I was certainly nervous in the play-off bearing in mind that I was one step away from playing in the Open,\" said the 29-year-old from Burnham. \"Obviously I'll be very apprehensive and nervous when I arrive on the first tee. After all this is a moment all golfers dream about; playing in the biggest tournament in the world. I just hope that I can produce my very best.\" He will certainly have time to gather his thoughts. Challen must suffer the entire field to tee-off before his turn comes at 4.06pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
