Their contribution to the Fabric series opens with Yello's Bananas to the Beat, the kind of brilliant cheesy-listening move now expected of them, and proceeds along cocktail-smooth lines. From the delicate music box melody of Lucio Aquilina's My Cube to the cut-up, blissful vocals of DJ Yellow &amp; Astrid Suryanto's To the Top, there's an irrepressible cuteness to their selections. Fabric 38 is perhaps played a little straighter than, for example, their landmark 2006 At the Controls mix, and there are a few too many longueurs, but the closing stages - the ascending synths of Basic Soul Unit's Tunnels, the last dance disco melancholy of Lopazz's 2 Fast 4 U - are pure bliss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
