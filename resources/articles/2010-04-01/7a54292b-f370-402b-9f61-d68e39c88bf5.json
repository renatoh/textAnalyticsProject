Hard on the heels of Saracens attracting more fans to Wembley than attended last weekend's derby between Manchester City and Manchester United, Wasps confirmed yesterday that they are expecting a crowd in excess of 60,000 for their St George's Day celebratory game against Bath at Twickenham on Saturday. With the weather set fair and tickets still available, it is even possible the final figure will be close to 70,000, a number eclipsed for a regular league fixture only by Harlequins' record-breaking gate of 76,716 for last December's Big Game. The difference between now and then is that the paying public can expect a more free-flowing spectacle following the change in refereeing interpretation which has re-energised the Guinness Premiership season. It is less than a month since the emphasis at the breakdown was tweaked in favour of the attacking side, but the Wasps coach Shaun Edwards hailed the initiative yesterday as the best thing to happen to the sport in ages. \"I think they were very brave to say, 'We've got a problem,' \" said Edwards. \"We needed the game to open up again and it's now being refereed as it was two to three years ago. I really admire the people at the top for being man enough to say: 'We need to make a change.' Thank God they have, because all the top teams want to play rugby. We're in the entertainment business, as well as trying to win things.\" Wasps had previously been as loth as anyone to run the ball from their own half and risk being penalised in the shadow of their own posts. Now, having been \"incentivised to play rugby from anywhere on the park\", in the words of their director of rugby Tony Hanks, they have perked up so markedly in the spring sunshine that they could even guarantee themselves a play-off berth this weekend if they secure a bonus-point win and London Irish lose at Gloucester. If the club's fortunes continue to soar, Hanks also believes the England management will have to re-examine the international claims of Dominic Waldouck, Danny Cipriani and Dan Ward-Smith. The incisive Waldouck will be up against Shontayne Hape, one of his rivals for a midfield place on the June tour to Australia, while the Melbourne-bound Cipriani has the opportunity to underline his return to baton-wielding form. Waldouck, outstanding in the first-half against Worcester last week before limping off with an ankle problem, is making good progress and Phil Vickery, the 34-year-old former England captain, is also hoping to make his 50th appearance for Wasps in the wake of a six-month lay-off after neck surgery, which involved making an incision to the front of his neck, pushing aside the windpipe and replacing a worn-out disc to relieve pressure on his spinal cord. \"When you're out of the game for a long period of time it makes you re-evaluate things and you certainly ask yourself a lot of questions,\" Vickery said. ''I know everyone wants me to retire but I'm not bothered about them. Everyone you speak to says you know when it's time to retire. I haven't had that feeling yet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
