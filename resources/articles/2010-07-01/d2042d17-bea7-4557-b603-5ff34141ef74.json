Unhappily, large obstacles lie in your way. No business degrees as yet address the art of consultancy; since you are fresh from campus, no one in the business world has experienced your rare skills. Most importantly, you are young and corporate managers will wonder what someone so unlined can teach them about running a business. The good news is that the Initiatives in Business Development Group (IBD), an international organisation of advisers, has recognised these impediments and devised a scheme to reduce them. Graduates in business studies will be employed by IBD for a year, during which they will qualify for a Professional Certificate in Business Advice (PCBA), which is accredited by the University of Chester. They will also shadow and be shadowed by a mentor as they master the challenges of consultancy work. \"What disturbed me was that I could be a dustman today, go home, take off my overalls and set up as a business consultant the next day without any qualifications,\" says Terry Forrester, managing director of IBD, who conceived the idea. \"The PCBA, which is half way to an MBA, is the first professional certificate in business advice and it should be a boost for applicants who find they are one in 300 hopefuls taking part in a corporate training course.\" Each student will be assigned a permanent mentor who will supervise their work, and they will shadow experts in different fields as they diagnose and resolve clients' concerns. \"If a company has cash-flow problems we'll assign a cash-flow expert who the student will work with and if the client wants health and safety advice they'll attach themselves to a health and safety expert,\" says Forrester. After an intensive induction programme, students must take on six corporate clients who will pay reduced rates for their services and have the back up of the mentor should their inexperienced adviser flounder. In between, they are expected to attend three corporate development programmes and write three 6,000-word essays on what they have learned from each aspect of the course. Chris Terry, a 34-year-old graduate from Leeds Metropolitan University, was one of eight who signed up for the pilot scheme launched in January. \"I'd been made redundant from my job as a senior manager and wanted to go into business consultancy, but it was hard to find breaks despite my experience,\" he says. \"The course has given me insights into different areas of consultancy that I wasn't aware of \u2013 it can be much more specific than just turning round a failing company. Money couldn't buy the contacts it's given me.\" Three out of the eight have already had promises of a job at the end of their course and IBD hopes to be able to recruit outstanding candidates itself when the scheme is rolled out across the UK in the summer. Successful applicants will have to pay \u00a31,000 which will be refunded at the end of the course and can expect to earn up to \u00a325,000, including commission. Ten per cent of this will be deducted by IBD to fund the training. More valuable than income, however, is the network of professionals to which they will be introduced and the hands-on experience gained from working with clients. \"When I lost my job I was very negative about the future, but I've learned from the course that the world's your oyster if you put yourself in the right situation,\" says Chris Terry. \"I've been awakened to many different levels of opportunity and feel confident now that I'll be able to set up my own business.\" For more details visit ibd-uk.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
