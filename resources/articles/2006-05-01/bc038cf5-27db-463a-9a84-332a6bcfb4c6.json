The blissful childhood that would become the inspiration for much of his recollecting and work ended when his father died of leukemia in 1917, leaving the family with tremendous financial burdens as well as the task of caring for Cornell's younger brother, Robert, who had cerebral palsy. Thanks to his mother's insistence on education and belief in the arts, and to her numerous part-time jobs, Cornell was able to attend Phillips Academy in Andover from 1917 to 1919, where he studied, with no particular success, sciences and Romance languages. Between 1921 and 1931, Cornell hawked fabric samples in Manhattan's manufacturing district. It was during this period that he had his first contacts with the New York art world, attending ballet and opera performances, frequenting gallery exhibitions, and avidly reading literature, poetry and art history. This was also when he began rummaging through dime stores and rare book and junk shops. He amassed a prodigious archive of objects and images that would later become the source material for his boxes and collages. Perhaps in the spirit of this exploration and transformation, Cornell converted to Christian Science. Through a fortuitous meeting in 1931, Cornell became acquainted with gallery owner Julian Levy, and within a year several of his two-dimensional collages appeared in an exhibition of surrealist art at the Julian Levy gallery. Over the next few years, Cornell experimented with, refined and perfected his medium of box construction, first using boxes he found or bought, and later making his own. He did all of his work in the basement of the house he shared with his mother and Robert on Utopia Parkway, in Flushing, Queens. As his reputation spread, his boxes began to appear in galleries all over New York. At the same time, he wrote and created several films. He also became a kind of reclusive vertex of the art world, hosting Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Matta, and several other important surrealist and non-surrealist painters, writers, poets, and - his favourite - ballet dancers. In the late 1930s, inspired by the bird cages hanging in the window display of a local pet store, Cornell began his aviary series, one he would work on until his death. The boxes, which at first featured only parakeets (cutouts from natural history books and children's shooting gallery sets, mounted on conforming pieces of jigsawed wood), would soon include owls, cockatoos, canaries, and finally, about a decade later, an absent bird: an empty perch in a barren cage. Cornell's birds were often world travellers who pasted collage remnants of their exploits on the walls of their cages: hotel paraphernalia, foreign newspaper clippings, European advertisements, theatre and dance programmes. They were alter-egos of Cornell himself, who, because of his need to care for Robert and help support the family, didn't venture outside of the New York City area after his Andover years. The birds left traces; Cornell gathered traces together. Cornell continued making and exhibiting his poetic theatres, concentrating on such themes as ballet, astrology, mathematics, soap bubbles, Medici princes and princesses, hotels and children. Even though he eventually achieved international acclaim, the inability of art critics to group him with any of the prevailing movements that developed in the art world during the period of his long career - surrealism, abstract expressionism, pop art, minimalism - made his place in the canon precarious and unique. (Compared with an artist like Warhol, Cornell acquired relatively little fame, and a tremendously adamant following.) His brother Robert died in 1965; his mother the following year. While his work output then declined, he hired assistants to help scavenge for and construct his boxes, and he still corresponded with a large number of people - including his deceased brother and mother, for whom he would continue to buy gifts. Cornell's final museum show was, at his request, given for children. Letters were written, mailboxes fed like starving animals. \"CHILDREN'S PREVIEW of the exhibition JOSEPH CORNELL - COLLAGES AND BOXES.\" It was to be his first museum show dedicated to children, and the last show of his life. He died in his home, on December 20 1972, of heart failure. Hundreds went that spring in 1972. His boxes were displayed at an appropriately low eye level, and chocolate cake and cherry soda were served in place of canap\u00e9s and champagne. Many were entranced by Cornell's works, some cried, some fell asleep on the parquet, and some left with \"party favours\" - complimentary posters, signed by Cornell. Fifteen years later, a young woman received one of these posters in the mail. It was from an ex-lover she hadn't thought about since college. Just above Cornell's signature he had written: \"I love this. You will love this.\" When the young woman died in a car accident the following summer, the poster was rolled up and forgotten about. 1992: The young woman's brother asked a friend (who would, years later, become a friend of mine) if he would help sift through a roomful of boxes in an upstate storage facility. It was time to save what was worth saving and part with the rest. He couldn't do it alone. When they came upon the poster, both were surprised: the friend because of the rare artifact of his favourite artist's life, the brother because above the two pieces of handwriting (Cornell's signature and the love note), was a third - in shaky blue ink: \"This belonged to Beatrice.\" He didn't know if it had been written by his father, or mother, or by his sister herself. And because he was alone - his parents having passed away the previous winter, within a month of each other - there was no way to find out. By the time I saw the poster - on an August 1995 visit to my friend's studio - there was another text, this one, like the first two, of known origin. The brother had written: \"A gift of a gift of a gift.\" \"He needed to get rid of it,\" my friend told me. \"It was that kind of gift.\" My friend had attached the poster to a large canvas, hoping to make good use of it in a painting for an upcoming show. In the brief conversation that ensued, I learned the history of the poster, and learned, for the first time, about Cornell, who was \"not quite a surrealist,\" and had \"exhausted his medium, as all geniuses do\". That afternoon, following something between a whim and a premonition, I went to the New York Public Library and found the catalogue for Moma's 1980 Cornell retrospective. On the withdraw card was a roster of names: those belonging to the 11 people who had already taken the book out that year. I remember Elena Salter, and I remember Donald Franks. I remember a Henry, a Theresa, a Jennifer and a James. Each name was written in a different script, each with a different pen, held by a different hand. I signed my name into the registry - as if the catalogue were a hotel, as if I expected to meet the 11 others in some metaphysical lobby - and took it home. My life began to change. By the end of the summer, I was pursuing obscure references, tracking down essays about essays about essays. When the new school year began, I spent afternoons in the university art library, sifting through the precious few books that had Cornell images. I hunted for more images, more stories, and spent weekends in Manhattan's rare art book stores, flipping through the pages of limited-edition gallery catalogues that I would never be able to afford. I read Deborah Solomon's biography (dedicated to her husband, Kent Sepkowitz) when it came out in 1997, and even gave a copy of it to a girl I was then interested in. \"I love this,\" I wrote on the title page, and, \"You will love this.\" (What was the this? The biography? Cornell? The love of Cornell? Of gifts? Of inscriptions? The love of the beginning of love?) It wasn't until two years and hundreds of hours of research later - a quarter of a century after those first letters were sent out - that the seeds of the simple idea were planted: I must do something with my love - for Cornell, for my love of Cornell, for gifts, inscriptions and the beginning of love. I began to write letters. I wanted to assemble a book of writing inspired by Cornell's bird boxes, but little else. Would the book be literature, art, or some combination of the two? Should the pieces be of approximately the same length? How many images would be reproduced, and how would such a book be designed? Without knowing exactly what distinguished the book I was envisioning from those already published - except that mine would be fiction and poetry from a variety of sources - I couldn't well answer what should have been my original question: Why? Who the hell was I - unpublished college student, self-educated in art history, uneducated in book publishing - to ask for things from people I didn't know, with nothing to offer in exchange? And yet, by the end of the week, seven writers had agreed - quite enthusiastically - to be part of the still-forming project, and within half a year, I had a nearly completed manuscript. It wasn't my supplication they were responding to, it was Cornell's - not even Cornell's, but that of his boxes. The boxes called the writers in from great distances; they demanded the attention of those who had no attention to spare. \"I'm going to be in Tunisia for the next few months,\" one author responded, \"but I'd like to give this my best shot.\" Another wrote his story on note cards as he travelled through the Spanish countryside by train. Another while she was preparing for an Italian sabbatical. The boxes moved questions of logistics to the backdrop. No one asked about fees or agents or publishers. They didn't ask about these things because they weren't responding to me. Their responses predated my call. I was just lucky enough to intercept them. Many of Cornell's most brilliant boxes were not intended for the museums in which they now reside. They were gifts, tokens of affection - \"I love this. You will love this.\" He had them delivered to his favourite movie stars and authors. He handed them, personally, to his most loved ballerinas. And they were almost uniformly sent back. He was rejected, laughed at, and, in one unfortunate case, tackled. But the boxes themselves, not his hopelessly romantic supplication, survived. More than survived - they came to be considered among the most seminal works of 20th-century art. Their call beckoned, and continues to beckon, curators, museum-goers, and so many artists and writers. Their call, not Cornell's. They became gifts of gifts of gifts of gifts - a cascade of gifts without fixed givers or receivers. \u00b7 Extracted from A Convergence of Birds, edited and introduced by Jonathan Safran Foer, published by Hamish Hamilton on Thursday at \u00a318.99.
