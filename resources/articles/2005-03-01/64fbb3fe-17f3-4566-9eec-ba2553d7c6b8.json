Steve Bucknor, a spring chicken at 58, modestly downplays his achievement. \"I value having stood in four World Cup finals much more,\" he said. \"If an umpire hangs around for 10 years he'll eventually stand in 100 Tests. But four World Cup finals - now, that's an achievement.\" Bucknor is known for his deliberative decision-making. \"I ask myself a list of questions,\" he explained. \"If the answer to every one of them is positive, I give the batsman out. But I prefer to say 'not out' - I am happier that way.\" Over the years he has inevitably had his share of disagreements with captains, rating Inzamam-ul-Haq as easy to work with but Sourav Ganguly much tougher. He and Ganguly have never got along and the Indians complained repeatedly about his umpiring during their 2003-04 tour of Australia. Yesterday, before the second Test, the mind games began. \"The pitch has some grass on it,\" Ganguly said. \"We may play an unchanged team, with three seamers and one spinner.\" Was this a bluff? Harbhajan Singh, who has taken 27 wickets in his past three Tests here, had been considered a certainty to be brought in. \"Harbhajan likes bowling here,\" India's coach John Wright had said. \"He has a good chance of making the side.\" But Ganguly thought otherwise. \"This pitch reminds me of the 1999 Test against Pakistan,\" he said. Then, Pakistan were reduced to 26 for six by Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad before fighting back to win the game. Spinners took only eight of the 40 wickets that fell. For a pitch in the subcontinent to be covered with grass and not help the spinners is as unusual as, say, Inzamam winning a ballet competition. But to Inzamam it was no surprise. \"I was sure when we began this series,\" he said, \"that we were not going to get spinning tracks.\" Old hands at the Eden Gardens revealed, however, that some of the grass from the previous day had already been shaved off and more would follow. The pitch may take spin from the second day. Harbhajan therefore is likely to take part, and Sachin Tendulkar may play a crucial role as a fifth bowler and third spinner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
