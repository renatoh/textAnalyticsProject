Street crime, drugs and prostitution were rife in the historic Pelourinho and Santo Ant\u00f4nio neighbourhoods and tourists would only venture in by day to admire the decaying colonial mansions and beautiful churches, returning to their seafront hotels as soon as the sun went down. Despite this, the young British artist fell in love with the area and decided to make it his home. He bought an old ruin in Santo Ant\u00f4nio and set about converting it into a stylish and comfortable pousada (guest house) with eight rooms. A decade later the Hotel Red Fish, with its green shutters, quiet courtyard, white walls and cool stone floors, is doing a brisk trade and the neighbourhood has undergone a transformation. 'I suppose you could call it gentrification,' says Butler, 'although that often has negative connotations and the change here has all been for the better.' In the last two years Santo Ant\u00f4nio has seen a European invasion as French, Italians and Germans snap up the elegant and ramshackle town houses at bargain prices and convert them into guest houses. Red Fish was the third hotel in the neighbourhood when it opened. Now there are 10 and, according to Butler, they are proving popular with foreign tourists looking for an alternative to the bland four-star hotels on the seafront. However, the final stamp of respectability for the area came two weeks ago with the opening of the Convento do Carmo, a restored 16th-century monastery which has been converted into a luxury hotel. Owned by the Portuguse group Pestana, it's the first hotel of its kind in Salvador, combining character with five-star facilities such as a swimming pool, butler service, gym and spa. Butler believes the hotel will be good for the area: 'As soon as the hotel opened, the police turned up promising to stamp out street crime. The street now has proper lighting, the houses opposite have been painted and the electric cables have been buried. It looks nicer and it's much safer,' he said. Locals are confident that the hotel will bring in well-heeled tourists to the neighbourhood which in turn will encourage more restaurants and bars to open up. For now, one of the best local restaurants for sampling typical Bahian fare is Axego (1 Rua Jo\u00e3o de Deus). Try the moqueca de camar\u00e3o a spicy seafood stew cooked in coconut milk. Cruz do Pascoal (Largo do Pascoal) is a laid-back cafe-bar popular with locals, serving good steaks and cold beer on a sunny terrace with great views over the city. The main advantage of staying in Santo Antonio is that you are within walking distance of Salvador's most interesting historic and cultural sites. A short stroll down the hill will bring you to the Largo do Pelourinho, the square where slaves were auctioned and tortured (pelourinho means whipping post). There are many fine colonial-era churches to explore and countless performances of Bahian music, dance and capoeira on the streets and in cultural centres. As I check out of the Hotel Red Fish there's a fashion shoot happening across the road with models posing outside an aesthetically decaying old ruin. with peeling shutters.
