Jimmy, a 6ft 4in committed Christian, was stabbed to death in an \"unprovoked and vicious\" assault at the Three Cooks bakery in Lee, south-east London, less than 500 metres from his home. The suspect was being questioned by detectives at a police station in London, the Metropolitan police said. Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, who is leading the investigation, said Jimmy had encountered his attacker after going into the shop with an older brother having bought his first lottery ticket. \"The youth, intent on violence, offered him [Jimmy] outside for a fight. Jimmy ... declined that fight, and the aggressor was left outside the bakery,\" Lyons said. \"Not content with matters ending there, the youth then proceeded to smash down the door of the bakery, shattering the glass. \"He also picked up an advertising board and took it inside the bakery and wielded it around. A fight ensued and Jimmy received a fatal blow to his neck, cutting his throat with some glass. Jimmy was a person of immaculate character, as was everyone from the Mizen family, and he is a victim of an entirely unprovoked and vicious attack.\" On Monday police said a \"significant witness\" had come forward and would be interviewed. They had wanted to trace a middle-aged white man whom they said had witnessed some of the attack. Last Friday was Jimmy's birthday. A celebratory leavers' Mass at St Thomas More Catholic school in Eltham on Monday was turned into a memorial service for him. He was the 13th teenager to have been fatally attacked in London this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
