The Uruguay international was accused of misleading Liverpool over his intention to shake Patrice Evra's hand at Old Trafford by the club's managing director, Ian Ayre, and Kenny Dalglish has left the striker in no doubt he feels badly let down by Su\u00e1rez's behaviour on Saturday. The Liverpool manager is anxious for the 25-year-old to concentrate on the club's pursuit of Champions League qualification, the FA Cup and Carling Cup for the remainder of the season but, despite the problems, has no intention of selling his finest forward. PSG, backed by a Qatari investment fund and in the market for a high-profile striker having failed to attract Carlos Tevez to France in January, are the first club to register an interest in Su\u00e1rez following Saturday's episode and Sunday's apologies. According to L'Equipe, PSG officials made their interest known to Su\u00e1rez's representatives and have the funds to test his club's resolve in the summer. Liverpool, however, see Su\u00e1rez's future on Merseyside and, while reluctant to make any further comment on the \u00a322.8m signing from Ajax in the hope of moving on from the sorry affair, Dalglish has insisted the striker's position at the club is not an issue. The Liverpool manager said on Thursday: \"I can only reiterate, we have drawn a line under what happened and we just want Luis to concentrate on his football now.\" Following his own apology and dressing-down by Liverpool last Sunday, Su\u00e1rez has trained as normal this week and is expected to feature in Sunday's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at Anfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
