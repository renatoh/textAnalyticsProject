If so, it has turned out to be the victory of hope over experience and of self-belief over common sense. The prime minister has been back from his vacation for four days now, and it is already clear that nothing substantial in British politics has changed at all since the pre-holiday season. Mr Blair and his entourage may talk as usual of renewed energy and fresh initiatives; but few elsewhere are deceived. Outside the Downing Street bunker the only question that anyone asks about the Blair premiership is how long it will now last - not whether it can be revived. Peering into the mists of a stretching political autumn, a single dominant issue looms over the domestic agenda: when will he go? In some ways, of course, this is all terribly unfair. It is less than 18 months since Mr Blair led Labour to victory once more, having pledged to serve a third term while not seeking a fourth. Very little has happened in those 18 months to require the prime minister to pass on that mandate to anyone else - although the simmering cash for peerages scandal might yet do so. Yet the underlying truth, visible even in the 2005 election, is that Britain long ago fell out of love with Mr Blair. The press is aggressively bored with him and is only interested in the succession. Labour support ebbs towards the Conservatives in the polls, threatening dire May elections and alarming what remains of the party faithful. The August scare raised questions equally about Islamist terrorism and British foreign policy. Ask yourself why it is uniquely necessary for Mr Blair to stay in office and the answer to that question is no longer obvious. Downing Street announced at the weekend that Mr Blair was fully focused on the questions - terrorism and immigration - that are said to dominate the minds of the voters. This smug response does not wash any more. Insofar as voters - as opposed to the tabloid editors before whose prejudices New Labour has always cringed - are really fixated on these issues, it is not clear that they any longer look to Mr Blair for answers. What the public wants from government in any field are systems that work and endure. But they do not see that in the mushrooming of home-grown terrorism which his foreign policies have actually done something to provoke; nor do they see it in the failures in migration policy that are pushing the government towards barring the door against Romanian and Bulgarian workers from January. It would be truer to say that Mr Blair is increasingly associated with failure, well-intentioned failure maybe, but failure nonetheless. The prime minister - nearly a decade in his bubble now - sometimes appears to be the last person in the country to grasp this reality. The realpolitik of the new political term is that Mr Blair can propose but not dispose. He only has one realisable ambition now: to try to hold on to his job for a few more months in the face of policy failure at home and abroad, Tory challenge, Labour disillusion and exhausted political capital - and then to depart with dignity. This is what lies behind the efforts by Blair loyalists like Tessa Jowell, Lord Falconer and Stephen Byers over the past few days. Mr Byers wrote yesterday of Labour's need to set a course for the next 10 years. But the reality is that Mr Blair's eyes are not set on 2016 but on getting past the conference season and surviving into October. He appears prepared to pay almost any price to retain his vestigial authority so that he can leave at a moment of his own choosing next year. This may look reasonable to Mr Blair and to those around him. But it makes precious little sense any longer to anyone else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
