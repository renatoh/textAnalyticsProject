Murdoch, 72, who owns a 34 per cent stake in the satellite broadcaster, would not dilute his control of the company, but sources say he is considering whether to appoint a successor in a bid to appease shareholders who are unhappy about the changes. Shareholders have expressed concern at plans to put James Murdoch, the 31-year-old chief of Star TV, in charge of the company after chief executive Tony Ball stands down. It emerged last week that Ball, whose contract expires next May, is negotiating his severance pay from the broadcaster. But BSkyB investors fear that Murdoch would use the appointment of his son as a way to divert cash from Sky into other parts of his empire - particularly DirecTV, in which Murdoch acquired a controlling stake earlier this year. 'There is some suggestion that Murdoch might step aside from the role of chairman,' said one City source. Shareholders are keen to see some reward for their support of BSkyB, which has endured some rocky years. After a long period of heavy investment while BSkyB subsidised its heavy transfer from analogue to digital technology, it celebrated profits of \u00a3128 million this year. Ball later cashed in share options to the value of \u00a39m. But shareholders now want to see dividend payouts reflecting their patience with the company's lean years. The company could face a shareholder revolt at its annual meeting in November. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of fund manager Isis, said that shareholders wanted to be reassured there were enough independent directors . 'We want to see BSkyB's cash used for the benefit of shareholders,' he said. 'We want to ensure that there are enough independent voices on the board. 'Tony Ball is perceived to have done a very good job at BSkyB. Executives like that are hard to come by and we want to know that anyone who replaces him will be of the same calibre.' Another leading institutional investor said: 'If the Dirty Digger fires Ball to put his boy in the job, shouldn't there be a corporate governance response to this? I think investors should have a collective response via the National Association of Pension Funds.' Sources within the company say that a range of senior News Corp executives have been earmarked to step up to an enhanced deputy chief executive role to give James Murdoch support while he is learning the ropes. They include chief operating officer Richard Freudenstein, former Sun editor David Yelland, Sky Networks managing director Dawn Airey and finance director Martin Stewart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
