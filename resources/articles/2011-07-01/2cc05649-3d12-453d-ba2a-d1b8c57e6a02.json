This is normally the name of a different group of peoples \u2013 whose roots stem from a historical heartland that ranges from northern Sudan into Egypt \u2013 so for the avoidance of confusion \"Nubians\" should have been avoided by us in writing about the inhabitants of the Nuba mountains (Fear stalks the hills for victims of Sudan's forgotten war, 4 July, page 1; 'The south's leaders sold us off', 4 July, page 19). \u2022\u2008An article on the natural resources available in the Arctic and the impact their possible exploitation could have on indigenous people incorrectly named Aqqaluk Lynge as the former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council.
