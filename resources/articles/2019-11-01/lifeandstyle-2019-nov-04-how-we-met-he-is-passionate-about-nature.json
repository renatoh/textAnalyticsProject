At the end of 2004, he had just finished a walk in Japan when he met Konomi Kikuchi. \u201cI was giving a presentation that was being translated into Japanese for the audience,\u201d he says. \u201cI noticed she was laughing at my jokes before the translation.\u201d Konomi, a writer, says she was inspired by the Briton\u2019s mission to spread the message about the environment. The author of 11 books, she was keen to write about Paul and his life\u2019s work on her blog. Shortly afterwards, Konomi\u2019s editor read her blogpost and asked her to write a book about Paul. To celebrate its publication at the 2005 Expo in Nagoya, he planned to walk round the island of Okinawa. \u201cI was fascinated by his character,\u201d Konomi says. \u201cSo I asked if I could go with him on part of his trip.\u201d They ended up spending a week together. \u201cI discovered that he has a great sense of humour and a big heart. He is so passionate about nature and the planet. It made me rethink the way I had been living my life.\u201d Konomi loved exploring the outdoors. By the end of the week, Paul had fallen in love with her. \u201cI realised her whole personality was wonderful. She\u2019s very giving and has such a loving nature. She\u2019s the whole package.\u201d Konomi had recently come out of a relationship and wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready for something new. \u201cPaul was happy to take things slowly \u2013 or just be friends if that was what I wanted. He accepted me for who I was.\u201d This acceptance encouraged her to take the plunge and their relationship progressed quickly. In September 2005, they were married in Japan. Several months later, Paul was invited by the Earth Day movement to take part in a three-month walk around China, Korea and Japan. \u201cThe trip was designed to unite the Earth Day movements in those three countries and send a message of goodwill,\u201d he says. \u201cWe started at the Great Wall of China in January in temperatures of \u201315C, which was extremely challenging for Konomi.\u201d She says she almost gave up but Paul encouraged her to persevere. \u201cI was carrying all my makeup and cosmetics, which was making it even harder. Eventually, he persuaded me to ditch them to make my bag lighter. I\u2019ve never worn makeup since!\u201d When they married, Paul had promised that they would find the \u201cmost beautiful place in the world\u201d to live. In 2007, they bought some land in Ays\u00e9n, a remote area of Patagonia in Chile. Accessible only by ferry and five hours from the nearest city, the region is surrounded by glaciers and forests. \u201cFrom the first moment, I fell in love with it,\u201d says Konomi. Over the next few years, the couple built a home from scratch. \u201cThere is no road to the house so we carried all the materials on our backs,\u201d says Paul. \u201cIt was his idea to build the house but I had total faith in him,\u201d says Konomi. \u201cIf he could walk round the world, he could make this happen.\u201d To create the sustainable lifestyle they dreamed of, the couple planted more than 1,000 native trees and built terraces, greenhouses and ponds to collect rainwater. Food is sourced from their land and they get fresh water from the stream. The couple now use their expertise to support local community projects. \u201cWe are trying to create a fully sustainable local economy,\u201d says Paul. \u201cAt the moment a lot of food is imported, so it travels for many miles. If there\u2019s a storm and supplies are cut off it means there is no food.\u201d They have made plenty of friends there and enjoy exploring Patagonia in their spare time. \u201cEvery day is an adventure. It\u2019s like living in a 1,000km national park,\u201d says Paul. \u201cKonomi and I are together for 24 hours a day but we are best friends. We have a wonderful life.\u201d Want to share your story?
