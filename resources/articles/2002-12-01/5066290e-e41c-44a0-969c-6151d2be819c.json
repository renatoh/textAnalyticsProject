Celtic had failed to stay in Europe beyond Christmas for 23 years, and they had never knocked out Spanish opposition. Celtic, however, recovered quickly from losing their place at the top of the Scottish Premier League with a painful defeat to their greatest rivals Rangers at Ibrox. And their manager Martin O'Neill was able to celebrate from the dugout after being given a reprieve by Uefa after being sent to the stand in the last meeting between these clubs. Celtic were looking for that all-important early goal and it almost come in the first minute. Henrik Larsson broke free in the box and tried to pull the ball back for his striking partner John Hartson, but Fernando Gabriel Caceras made a vital interception to put the ball wide. The home side, spurred on by their passionate supporters, took some time to find their momentum but they gave Celtic a warning when Joos Valgaeren gave away a free- kick after a foul on Gustavo Lopez and from the resulting set-piece he teed the ball up for Benny McCarthy to strike his right-footed shot wide. Stilian Petrov then almost got on the end of Larsson's knock-down from Agathe's cross to the far post, but Jose Manuel Punto reacted quickly to jump on the loose ball. Lopez looked a real threat and he fired a dangerous right-footed ball across the face of goal, but his team-mates were unable to convert the chance. The visitors needed the heroics of Robert Douglas to deny the Spaniards in the 22nd minute. McCarthy pulled the ball back into the path of Mora Nieto Jesuli and his right-foot shot was turned around the post by the Scotland goalkeeper. But there was little he could do to prevent Celta Vigo levelling the tie a minute later in a move almost identical to their last chance. McCarthy pulled the ball back for his team-mate again and this time Jesuli dummied and took the ball on to give himself a better angle but his shot took a wicked deflection of Ulrik Laursen and flew past Douglas. Valgaeren lost his temper as he was booked for a bad tackle before Pinto produced a great piece of agility to return Petrov's corner over the crossbar. But Hartson scored a vital away goal for Celtic with an unstoppable right-foot shot into the bottom corner before being booked moments later after a late challenge on Peter Luccin. McCarthy gave the Spanish side a lifeline in the 53rd minute when he converted Lopez's cross at the near post to put the hosts ahead. But Celtic hung on to erase memories of last weekend. Celta Vigo: Pinto; Caceres, Berizzo, Mendez, Juanfran, Edu, Jose Ignacio, Lopez, Luccin, McCarthy, Jesuli.
