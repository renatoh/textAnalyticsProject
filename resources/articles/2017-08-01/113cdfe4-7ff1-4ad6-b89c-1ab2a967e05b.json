Romano Prodi, the economist and former Italian prime minister, said the Brexit negotiations had made little progress in the first year after the referendum and urged both sides to begin making concessions on trade and immigration to reach a deal. In an interview with the Observer, he said that more and more people were suggesting to him in private that a second referendum may be needed. However, he said a \u201chistoric compromise\u201d would eventually be reached because the Europe-wide economic consequences of failure had been heavily underestimated. \u201cMaybe I am biased, being an economist, but it may be that there is still an imprecise [understanding] of the real economic consequences of Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why I am now looking deeper and deeper that a compromise must be reached. Not to repeat the referendum as is mentioned more and more often in private conversations \u2013 I think that is impossible, or very difficult \u2013 but to find a compromise to avoid suicide.\u201d Prodi said he used such strong language because of \u201cthe damage for the UK\u201d that would come as a result of crashing out of the EU with no deal. While Theresa May has made ending free movement a red line in talks with the EU, Brussels has repeatedly stated that full single market access is impossible without handing freedom of movement to EU nationals. Prodi suggested a British compromise on immigration that would see some sectors given \u201can exception\u201d. He said Britain should begin breaking the issue down \u201cstep by step and sector by sector\u201d. \u201cFor example, we have joint scientific projects in which the UK has always had a strong position because of your universities and tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, movement of manpower in this sector is of deep interest and does not move any passion even in the core of anti-European British [voters]. In my opinion, you should start giving guarantees in all these fields in which there is a common interest to have an exception.\u201d Prodi called on Brussels to preserve as much trade with Britain as possible to avert serious economic damage. \u201cIt is so clear that it is impossible to dismantle this type of agreement without real damage on both sides,\u201d he added. \u201cIn this case, the weight of damage is probably heavier on the UK side, but there is damage on both sides.\u201d His intervention comes with no sign that the EU is prepared to cut a deal that would dilute the principle of free movement. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has also signalled he may not even sanction the beginning of talks in October unless the UK begins to compromise over the divorce bill or the status of EU nationals in Britain. The Sunday Telegraph reports that the UK is prepared to pay up to \u00a336bn to the EU to settle the divorce bill. Meanwhile, Sir Vince Cable has lashed out at hardline Brexit \u201cmartyrs\u201d who view economic pain as a price worth paying to break away from Brussels. The Liberal Democrat leader accused them of \u201cmasochism\u201d and claimed older Brexit voters with views \u201ccoloured by nostalgia from an imperial past\u201d had imposed their will on a younger generation more comfortable with the European Union. Reflecting on the first year after the Brexit vote, Prodi said there had been \u201cblood on the floor\u201d, but little progress. \u201cI hope that in the second year there will be settlements safeguarding what can be saved in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that, in the end, a historic compromise will be convenient for both sides. I am convinced because we are too linked, too entangled.\u201d His remarks coincide with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn coming under increasing pressure to soften his insistence that free movement will end after Brexit. One of Britain\u2019s most senior union bosses called for free movement to remain in place. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: \u201cThe government must give European workers the right to remain, or face losing skilled and experienced health and social care staff for ever. \u201cAny trade deal should be without tariffs and guarantee future free movement of EU labour. It must protect employment standards, jobs and economic growth. It should also provide for well-funded public services safe from any further privatisations.\u201d Other union figures remain more cautious. Tim Roache, head of the GMB union, said many of those who voted for Brexit \u201cdid so because of their experience of freedom of movement of labour and how it was used by exploitative employers in certain industries. \u201cFor too long employers have used freedom of movement as an alternative to investing in skills of the UK workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour is right to focus on jobs and it makes sense to keep the options open, particularly over a period of transition, and to be pragmatic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
