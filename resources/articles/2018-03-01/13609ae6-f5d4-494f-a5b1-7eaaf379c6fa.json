He talks up Terry Venables and Crystal Palace\u2019s Team of the 80s and creases into fits of giggles with tales of Alan Ball and his pack of \u201cmongrels\u201d who restored Pompey to the top flight. There are grimmer memories of the racism to which he was subjected as one of a number of homegrown black forwards who illuminated the English game from the late 1970s, and the depression which has hounded him from shifts on a building site to life as a roofer since his playing days. But the sparkle which made Hilaire stand out remains undimmed. \u201cAll I ever wanted was adulation,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember running out at Palace and that first song they sung about me: \u2018We\u2019ve got a brown boy on the wing, tra-la-la, la-la\u2019 to the Boney M tune \u2026 Now it would be seen as derogatory but I thought it was brilliant. \u2018They\u2019re singing about me.\u2019 If my own fans were happy with me, I wasn\u2019t bothered by what was thrown at me by the opposition.\u201d Hilaire remains an icon at Palace and Pompey, two of the six English clubs for whom he played over a 16-year professional career. Some would argue he failed to fulfil the potential first made public in a Thames Television documentary as a teenager. \u201cVince\u201d was Malcolm Allison\u2019s brain child, tracking a youngster\u2019s journey into professional football but also capturing Hilaire the cricketer scoring a wristy 37 for Essex. A need for footage from a school sports day would necessitate him competing in 100m, 200m and 400m races and left him vomiting on the sidelines. He would establish himself at the heart of a group who went from winning successive FA Youth Cups to briefly sitting atop the First Division. His talent earned him nine England under-21 caps, with his skill and vision compelling whether employed behind split strikers at Palace or on the flank with Pompey. Images of him in full flight, all splendid afro and blue and red sash, will adorn the big screens when the 58-year-old revisits Selhurst Park next month for the derby against Brighton. Fratton Park throws open its doors to him more regularly as an ambassador and member of Portsmouth\u2019s hall of fame. Now a resident of Southsea, he has found a home from home in the city to the extent that, when he spent a night in prison for unpaid parking fines in the early 1990s, he \u201cfelt safe because it was in Portsmouth\u201d. This is a player who agreed an improved contract with Venables at the urinals at Stansted airport, has been bitten by Dennis Wise and, having incurred a six\u2011game ban for pushing a referee, argued that he had mistaken the official, clad in black, for the player who had fouled him, Garth Crooks. Plenty of his stories reflect an innocence, from selling his Cup final tickets to a tout to the drinking culture in Ball\u2019s team, but the accounts of racist abuse are harrowing and he admits in the book he \u201cshould have been more sensitive of the social situation\u201d. \u201cBut I never saw myself as a figurehead,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reason we didn\u2019t say anything was because we wanted to get on. I\u2019d hear: \u2018Kick the black lad because they don\u2019t have too much bottle,\u2019 or \u2018It might be a bit cold for him today.\u2019 I\u2019ve had coaches say it to me. The reason I didn\u2019t come back with: \u2018What the fuck do you think you\u2019re talking about?\u2019 is because I wanted to play. Big C [Cyrille Regis], Laurie [Cunningham] were the same. None of us liked it but there was no support like there is now. The banana throwing and the monkey noises ... back then, it was almost normal.\u201d An opposing centre-half shouted \u201cWho\u2019s marking Midnight?\u201d on Hilaire\u2019s senior debut at Lincoln. As an opposing player at Elland Road he had fans singing \u201cNigger, nigger, pull the trigger\u201d as he prepared to take a corner. He once ran out to warm up at Anfield only for the pre-match murmur to be broken by a lone voice chanting \u201cDay-o, day-o\u201d, with the Kop then chorusing: \u201cDaylight come and he wan\u2019 go home.\u201d \u201cI remember going on a mazy against Nottingham Forest and being flattened. The player, to stop the ref booking him, apologised: \u2018The little man was just way too quick for me.\u2019 Then, once the ref\u2019s turned around, he\u2019s picked me up by my afro and said: \u2018Get up, nigger. Do that again and I\u2019ll have you.\u2019 I chased after him, the ref\u2019s blown up and booked me for reacting. But, even then, I didn\u2019t speak to anyone about it afterwards. It really sounds wrong saying it but you were just used to it.\u201d The account meanders off into more conventional, if gruesome, brushes with the hard men of the era. \u201cAt Pompey, Bally had this idea that Pat van den Hauwe was a weak link at Everton and I\u2019d take him to the cleaners: \u2018He can\u2019t play. Cannot play.\u2019 The ball\u2019s come to me from the kick-off, I\u2019ve miscontrolled it, but it looked like I\u2019ve done a trick and taken it round Van den Hauwe, so Bally\u2019s screaming: \u2018Told you! Get the ball to the little man. He\u2019s got him on toast.\u2019 The next time I had a chance to run at him was about 20 minutes in and Bally\u2019s up again: \u2018Go on, take him on ...\u2019 Anyway, as they\u2019re carrying me off on a stretcher, I remember Kevin Dillon peering over and muttering: \u2018You really did have him on toast, didn\u2019t you.\u2019\u201d That Pompey team was awash with characters, from Mick Channon to Noel Blake, with Hilaire accepted from the moment he scored a diving header on his debut against Blackburn. At Palace the east-end boy and his peers had risen to earn the moniker Team of the 80s. \u201cFootball came too easily and, because of that, you never think it\u2019ll go south. We\u2019d just beaten Forest, the European Cup winners, and we all thought this was just a dead easy game. \u2018Who\u2019ve we got Saturday, boss? Liverpool? Bring \u2019em on.\u2019 \u201cTerry said to me before that game to keep an eye on Terry McDermott because \u2018he makes these forward runs from nowhere\u2019. I was just like: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about that, gaffer.\u2019 Anyway, it was 0-0 approaching half-time and I\u2019ve stopped to scratch my nose, looked up and McDermott was about 15 yards in front of me and gone \u2026 next thing the ball\u2019s in the back of the net and I\u2019m running to the other side of the pitch pretending I\u2019d had nothing to do with it. They\u2019d been playing in third gear and won 3-0 but it could have been 15. We\u2019d never really known what it was like losing before. It snowballed from there.\u201d Hilaire\u2019s form warranted a full England cap in those early days in the top flight but the break-up of that side would see his career stagnate. \u201cIt turned into a bit of a Fred Karno\u2019s circus at Palace. I remember losing at Coventry where Clive Allen scored a goal that should have counted [the free-kick hit the framework at the back of the goal with the referee insistent it had struck a post] and Venners saying to us: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve just got to keep going and stick together. Things will come right.\u2019 We came in on the Monday to find out he\u2019d gone to QPR. Man overboard.\u201d Life after football has been tough at times on Hilaire. Depression left him listless and lonely \u2013 \u201cit never leaves you\u201d \u2013 and ventures into other lines of work were fleeting. His fear of heights limited his days as a roofer to jobs on bungalows, and the building site was a wake-up call. He thanks Portsmouth, the community, for embracing and saving him and, now a grandfather, spends his time as a part-time DJ with ambassadorial duties at a football club reborn. Kenny Jackett\u2019s team are climbing. Roy Hodgson\u2019s are attempting to stay up. Palace and Pompey still consider Hilaire one of their own.
