Second-round struggles for the Northern Irishman are becoming worryingly predictable. Without them McIlroy would have won far more than once this year. He was afflicted by the ailment yet again at the Scottish Open. McIlroy, who opened the event with a course-record 64 which planted him at the top of the leaderboard, slumped to a 78 on day two \u2013 from seven under to level par. \u201cIt was just one of those days where nothing really went right,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI\u2019m here for the weekend at least. I\u2019d be much happier standing here after shooting a couple of 71s but that\u2019s not the case. It hasn\u2019t been the case all year.\u201d Even by his own recently erratic standards this was remarkable stuff. As the round so rapidly unravelled, it became clear that McIlroy\u2019s mind has been affected by these regular bouts of inconsistency. Whether brilliant or dreadful, McIlroy remains a player one simply cannot take one\u2019s eyes off. McIlroy\u2019s woes began with a bogey on the opening hole after his approach shot missed the green. Having reached the turn in 38, two over, he went on to bogey the 10th and double-bogey the 12th after taking two to get out of a bunker. McIlroy was seven over for the day through 14 holes and suddenly flirting with the cut. The 25-year-old parred in from there and thus avoided what would have been an ignominious exit but he still cut a dejected on-course figure. \u201cThat\u2019s another Friday out of the way. Thank God,\u201d McIlroy said with a laugh. A stinging pre-Open critique of the state of Lee Westwood\u2019s game has arrived from a surprise source: the Englishman himself. A Friday 73 meant an aggregate of three over par for Westwood and ensured he lasted only 36 Scottish Open holes. Having tied third at last year\u2019s Open Championship \u2013 and held the 54-hole lead \u2013 he would ordinarily be fancied for the same event next week at Royal Liverpool. Yet after his second round here, the 41-year-old admitted to deep concern and frustration over his play. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what golf course I\u2019m on at the minute, I\u2019m still struggling,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cI need to sort it out. It\u2019s going to be a different test at Hoylake, a different course. \u201cI finished top three in three of the last five Opens so I know how to play links golf. I should just go and have the usual plan but you can\u2019t have confidence when you\u2019re hitting it shit like I am. I\u2019ve got to sort it out and start hitting it better. \u201cI\u2019ve not hit it well for two, three months now. You\u2019ll struggle on any golf course but when it\u2019s a major championship test, and there\u2019s likely to be a bit of breeze like this week, then you know you are going to struggle. \u201cYou just have to keep grinding away to find an answer. I know what I have to work on. It\u2019s just a case of teaching the old dog new tricks. You can\u2019t contend in tournaments when you\u2019re hitting the way I am.\u201d Westwood\u2019s sentiment will be noted by Paul McGinley. Westwood has played in eight Ryder Cups but is not currently inside the automatic qualification places for Europe\u2019s meeting with the United States in late September. McGinley would ordinarily hand a wild-card pick to Westwood but not, clearly, if his form and mood are poor. Westwood\u2019s Scottish appearance came after a three-week break, which he admitted was necessary because of over-playing during the early part of this year. \u201cI needed the time to not hit balls,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d played a lot of golf at the start of the season and didn\u2019t feel like playing, to be honest. I have to start scheduling better. I\u2019ve played way too much. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a train wreck, the schedule. I hit a few balls during those three weeks but nothing silly. I played one round. \u201cThe spark is not there at the moment. Starting to hit it better would be nice. When I look at the schedule for the rest of the year it\u2019s going to be too many tournaments, especially at 41 years old. You just get jaded, you need to be keen every time you tee off. That\u2019s why I had three weeks off. \u201cIt\u2019s not mental, it becomes mental when you stand there and you haven\u2019t got a shot, you can\u2019t aim anywhere.\u201d Justin Rose enjoyed contrasting emotions, after a second-round 68 placed him firmly in contention despite suffering from the effects of hay fever. The 2013 US Open champion did not play when the Open was last at Hoylake, eight years ago. Rose sits at minus five after two rounds here. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to click back into gear,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see good shots. I\u2019m beginning to feel like I\u2019m going to hit some good shots. Part of the reason for playing this week is just to work my way back into it for next week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
