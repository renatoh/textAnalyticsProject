On the one hand it is a rapidly urbanising region with many resources, it is in the process of acquiring better infrastructure, and it has in Nigeria a big power capable of underpinning its stability. Politically, the process of renewal in Liberia and Sierra Leone and the recent peaceful transfer of the presidency in Ghana are all examples of encouraging developments. On the other hand, there is huge unemployment in the cities of the southern part of the region and dangerous dislocation and alienation in the long neglected Sahel belt in the north. Above all there is Mali, which has lost control of the northern part of the country to Islamists and other dissidents, and, to make matters worse, has now lost what government it had been able to maintain in the south. Tuesday's arrest and resignation of Mali's prime minister, Cheikh Modibo Diarra, is yet to be fully explained, but it is certainly an indication of how flimsy the country's political arrangements are. Mr Diarra seems to have been thrown out by the young army officers who staged a coup in March and ostensibly handed over to a civilian administration a few weeks later, but in fact kept their hands on the levers of power. Quite how they justify now having any role at all is unclear, since they have signally failed to discharge any army's first duty, which is to defend the national territory. The Malian officer corps had a reasonable argument when it said that this was because successive civilian governments, fearful of coups, had starved the army of resources. But the way to resolve that was to wait for neighbouring states and outside powers to provide the help with training, equipment, and logistics that they have all said in principle they are ready to provide. Instead the Malian army has upset the fragile democratic institutions upon which a successful intervention in the north depends. A military reoccupation of the north could only be the first chapter in such an intervention. It would have to be followed by an intensive civilian effort to repair the neglect of decades of misrule by independent governments, and by the colonial power, France, before then. The last few months have seen a stuttering process of consensus-building between regional states, the Mali government, outside powers like the United States and France, and the UN, about intervention in Mali. It has been hampered by differences over how to constitute a force, how to pay for it, and how to guarantee the necessary civilian follow-through. But there were indications that we were getting to the point where there could be a credible intervention. The Malian officers have now put that still tentative prospect in doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
