There was enough of a rumpus after the three-day event scoring fiasco in which the German three-day eventer, Bettina Hoy, eventually lost team and individual gold medals for crossing the start line twice. The latest revelations could throw the sport into total disarray. Like wedding photographs after a divorce, pictures taken at four of the six Olympic equestrian medal ceremonies could soon have a sad out-of-date look to them if O'Connor and Beerbaum are disqualified. This would leave Brazil's Rodrigo Pessoa as individual gold medallist and the United States as the winning team. Ironically, Hoy's Ringwood Cockatoo was one of the other two horses that tested positive but, since she has already relinquished her gold medals, it does not make much difference. It has long been rumoured that the International Olympic Committee are eager to drop equestrian sports from the Games. If that is so, the presence of banned substances in the blood samples of these three horses - plus Foxy XX, ridden for the Austrian three-day event team by Harald Riedl - can only play into their hands. So far only the A samples taken in Athens have been tested but, as B samples are usually the same, nobody can hold out much hope of respite. Riders know that the top three horses will automatically be tested, so they are not likely to administer a banned substance intentionally. It is inconceivable that O'Connor would have entered with such gusto into the celebrations that followed his homecoming if he had harboured the slightest doubt about Waterford Crystal passing the drugs test. 'I had one fantastic day in my life, I'm an Olympic champion and no one can ever take that away from me,' he said, in a long interview that was published last Tuesday in The Irish Independent. It is sad to think that he may now have to eat those words. News of the positive tests, which broke on Friday afternoon, was still circulating among the riders at The Horse of the Year Show at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre where Pascal Levy, a Frenchman who now rides for the native country of his Spanish wife, rode Ingress II to win yesterday's Xerox Business Services Cup. This was Levy's first show in England but he nevertheless defeated Britain's Paul Barker on Temple Guess What by a comfortable margin of 5.87secs. You've read the piece, now have your say.
