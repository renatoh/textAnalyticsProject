The summary comes amid growing and bipartisan calls for the full document to be released to the public. Robert Mueller, the special counsel, delivered his report on his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to the Department of Justice on Friday. Barr committed to releasing a summary of the report to Congress as early as this weekend. Sources have indicated Mueller has brought no more charges in relation to his investigation, which has resulted in 37 indictments or guilty pleas including some of Donald Trump\u2019s closest former advisers. But the broader conclusions remain unknown and it falls to Barr, in office just over a month, to decide how the report will be presented to the public. On Sunday, Democrats and Republicans renewed calls for Barr to release the full report. The New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler, chair of the House judiciary committee, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union it was \u201ccrucial\u201d the report and its underlying evidence be made public. \u201cTransparency is key here,\u201d Nadler said, vowing to use subpoena powers should the full documents not be made available. He indicated he would be willing to take the case to the supreme court. \u201cWe will try to negotiate,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will try everything else first. But if we have to, yes, we will certainly issue subpoenas to get that information.\u201d Nadler indicated he would not allow the justice department more than a few weeks to release the documents. The House has already passed a resolution urging Barr to make the report public, although the move was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. Nonetheless, senior Republican senators joined a growing chorus for public release. The Texas Republican Ted Cruz backed the calls without going as far as to say underlying documents should be public. \u201cI think the report needs to be made public,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit needs to be released to the Congress and it needs to be released to the American people. This has consumed two years of the American people\u2019s time and we need full transparency.\u201d The Florida Republican Marco Rubio also voiced support for a full release and indicated he was supportive of underlying evidence being made available. Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, he said he would urge the White House not to invoke executive privilege to block parts of the report being published. \u201cI would certainly ask the president to lean towards transparency,\u201d Rubio said. Trump has remained circumspect since Friday, when he travelled to his club in south Florida for a weekend of golf. On Friday night Trump briefly addressed a Republican gathering at Mar-a-Lago but he did not mention Mueller or his work, until now the subject of countless tweets, complaints and defiant statements. The president\u2019s Twitter account remained unusually dormant for more than a day until brief tweets on Sunday morning wished his followers \u201ca great day\u201d and declaimed: \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d On Sunday, as the president arrived at the Trump International Golf Club, the White House reiterated that it had not yet been briefed on Mueller\u2019s report. On Saturday Trump teed off with the rock-rap musician Kid Rock, who tweeted a photograph showing the musician in a pair of stars-and-stripes trousers and the president in a red cap with \u201cUSA\u201d emblazoned on the front. Barr was pictured leaving his home in Virginia on Sunday morning as another full day of work was expected at the justice department in Washington. The attorney general was working with Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mueller as special counsel, to produce the summary. Rosenstein was involved in the firing of the former FBI director James Comey, who Mueller replaced at the head of the investigation, writing a memo cited by Trump when he removed Comey from office. The fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has alleged Rosenstein said the president ordered him to do so, bolstering arguments Trump\u2019s actions were an obstruction of justice. The circumstances of Comey\u2019s removal are expected to be a central focus of Mueller\u2019s work. Trump admitted to NBC in May 2017 he was prompted to fire Comey over \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d. Barr will have to balance the extraordinary public interest in the case with the protocol of refraining from releasing negative information about people who have not been charged. Democrats have cited recent examples of the justice department breaking disclosure norms, most prominently during the Hillary Clinton email investigation, to argue they are entitled to the entire report and its underlying evidence. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on Saturday said Barr\u2019s offer to provide a summary of principal conclusions was \u201cinsufficient\u201d and promised to reject any classified briefing. Justice department opinions hold that sitting presidents may not be indicted but Democrats argue Trump should not be immune. Trump faces a separate justice department investigation in New York examining payments to two women who say they had sex with him years before the election. The president has been implicated in potential campaign finance violations by his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, who says Trump asked him to arrange the payments. Federal prosecutors, also in New York, have been investigating foreign contributions to the president\u2019s inaugural committee. Trump refused to testify in person during the Mueller inquiry, instead he submitted answers in writing. Mueller charged 34 people, including the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and three Russian business entities. Close adviser Roger Stone is awaiting trial on charges he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering. On Saturday Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel, said the case of former Trump aide Rick Gates will be handed off to the US attorney for the District of Columbia. Court papers show he continues to help with several federal investigations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
