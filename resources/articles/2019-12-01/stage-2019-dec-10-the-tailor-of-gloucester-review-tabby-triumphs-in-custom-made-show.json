It\u2019s full of the spirit of the season, from the message of peace and goodwill to the snow-lined streets in the illustrations, the cherry-coloured twist used for the outfit and even the festive lurgy that lays the tailor low. As Potter\u2019s Peter Rabbit was reinvented as a kind of frathouse bunny in the recent James Corden film, audiences for Wiltshire Creative\u2019s musical production may expect more of a twist than the cherry-coloured variety. But the show sweetens the original, with the tone set by the tailor\u2019s pink-hued, present-lined workshop, which looks more like a Cath Kidston pop-up than the bare room that Potter drew. Verity Quinn\u2019s appealing design for the Playhouse\u2019s Salberg studio has bright cloths hanging from the balcony and even a length of green fabric to convey the mouldy walls of the tailor\u2019s home. It seems Scrooge-like to suggest that a festive children\u2019s show should look a bit bleaker, but the result is that amid such wall-to-wall finery the climactic unveiling of the mayor\u2019s wedding clobber lacks impact. Director Jo Newman\u2019s show has a female tailor, so cheerily played by Lara Stubbs that her straits never seem so dire and the stakes don\u2019t feel that high. But it\u2019s an engaging, likable performance and Jake Mitchell makes a flamboyant flunky to the mayor, while Glyn Kerslake tickles the ivories at a white baby grand in the corner. Gareth Machin and Glyn Kerslake\u2019s adaptation recognises that the book\u2019s best character is the crotchety cat Simpkin, with the growly meow and the insatiable appetite for plump mice. Natalie Williams gives us a sly, slinky and deliciously sarcastic Simpkin, who has a paw-licking ode to favourite types of fish. Williams\u2019s cat ears are craftily provided by a bow headband that is part of a bow motif stretching from the design of the tiles to the ribbon tied on the tailor\u2019s shoes. If the script cuts away many of the idiosyncrasies of Potter\u2019s storytelling, it\u2019s nevertheless an easy-to-follow, interactive tale with the cast deftly getting the children involved \u2013 at one stage they assemble the mayor\u2019s outfit \u2013 and just as deftly responding to their unpredictable interjections. This is an hour that\u2019s jaunty, prettily presented and worth it for the tabby of Gloucester. At Salisbury Playhouse, until 28 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
