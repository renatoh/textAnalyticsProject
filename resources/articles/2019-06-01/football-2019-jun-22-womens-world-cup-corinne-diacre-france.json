Often I\u2019m told I\u2019m very strict. We never laugh around, we never joke; everything is very calculated, there\u2019s no exceptions. The girls are very unhappy and you can see that on the field.\u201d Diacre has no time for stupid questions. Asked about her unbending reputation and whether it is modelled on the men\u2019s national team manager, Didier Deschamps, she delivered a suitably dismissive response. \u201cDidier? No, he\u2019s not my role model. We get on very well, we often talk to each other. I hope he doesn\u2019t resemble me,\u201d she adds mockingly. Next to her the France captain, Amandine Henry, could not stifle her grin as the manager, dripping with sarcasm, saw out the press conference before their tight win against Norway. It is refreshing. These stage-managed media gatherings are often bland affairs. There, the room was giggling, appreciating Diacre\u2019s dry humour. Diacre, preparing for Sunday\u2019s last-16 game against Brazil after three group-stage wins, has a spiky relationship with the press. These Fifa-enforced top-table appearances rankle with a woman who does not like the spotlight. On becoming manager of the professional men\u2019s team Clermont Foot in Ligue 2 the interest was global, but Diacre did not embrace the role of glass-ceiling breaker\u2013 she just wanted to manage and be treated like any other manager. There are two main types of pioneering female footballers and coaches. Those such as Ada Hegerberg, Megan Rapinoe and Emma Hayes are outspoken, top performers who use their profile to speak up on issues inside and outside the game. Then there are those such as Marta, Steph Houghton and, go back far enough, Lily Parr, who tell their stories but focus on the pitch, consciously or unconsciously fighting for equality through the very act of playing and being the best. Both types are important. Diacre falls into the latter camp. For a year the French sports daily L\u2019\u00c9quipe tried to arrange an interview as part of an Explore profile before the World Cup. It failed and was forced instead to resort to voices from around her to piece together the life story and development of France\u2019s manager. She is a reluctant trailblazer. The 44-year-old former international has a reputation for training players hard and demanding a tight adherence to the team\u2019s rules of conduct. The dropping to the bench of Val\u00e9rie Gauvin for France\u2019s opener at the Parc des Princes because the forward, in her own words, was late, was a hint that no occasion is too big to stray from procedure. Diacre, though, brushed over the decision, saying it was \u201ctactical\u201d. Gauvin\u2019s return to the fold for their second Group A game, after Diacre had insisted she would select an unchanged XI, was queried post-match. \u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t believe everything I say,\u201d Diacre responded. It is not uncommon for managers to skirt questions about possible starting lineups but the manner in which Diacre toys with the press catches the eye. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the pool and on the deckchair and the girls have been in the shade because, as I\u2019m very strict, they have to stay in the shade and in their rooms \u2013 of course, I make the most of the sun,\u201d she said before the Norway game. \u201cCompared to the weather we had in Paris, I\u2019m really enjoying myself. I\u2019m not working very hard \u2013 I let my staff do most of the work.\u201d She is funny. Ironically, her sense of humour is drawing the attention she is so keen to deflect. Having done so few interviews, her profile in France is surprisingly low, though the decision of the French Football Federation and the national broadcaster, TF1, to air the squad announcement live to the nation, as they did the men\u2019s, has made her more recognisable. Another boost to her profile and already healthy stock has come from France finishing top of their group with victories in front of sold-out crowds, albeit at times with less than convincing performances. After the controversial 1-0 defeat of a 10-player Nigeria thanks to Wendie Renard\u2019s 79th-minute penalty awarded after a VAR review, Diacre was typically direct in her assessment: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what we have to do better right now. We wanted to win our three group games and it\u2019s done even if it was difficult. But that\u2019s how you build momentum.\u201d No matter how it was achieved, it was still France\u2019s eighth consecutive victory and their 17th in their last 18 matches. Win the World Cup, while continuing to entertain along the way, and she will have to get used to the attention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
