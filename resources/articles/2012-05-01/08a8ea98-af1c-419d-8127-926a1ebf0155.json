Yet the central institution of France's honours system remains heavy with dignity. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's first act as France's president was to take up the grand collar of the order, over which he now presides. Today in London, the French ambassador will present the order's senior rank, commander of the legion of honour, to an Englishman. Theodore Zeldin, historian of French life and presiding spirit of the Oxford Muse Foundation, which aspires to forge trust between strangers, is only the second foreigner to receive the honour this year. That the other was Aung San Suu Kyi indicates the esteem in which Dr Zeldin is held in France. \"He understands us better than we know ourselves,\" Livres de France once said. If David Cameron wants to improve his relations with the Elys\u00e9e's latest resident, he should call Dr Zeldin for some advice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
