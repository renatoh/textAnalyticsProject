Schoolchildren with him in the studio in Manchester composed tunes, and he improvised on them on the piano. Eventually he orchestrated them so that the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra could play the finished result in front of the children. The 13 programmes were broadcast across the ITV network and were considered to be a great success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
