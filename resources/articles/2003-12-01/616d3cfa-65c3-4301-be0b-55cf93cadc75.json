If a boy is taking you out on a seasonal date, it must be that he will turn up on your doorstep wearing a huge great big bow tie. You want it to be immense! Overwhelming! Totally Robin Day! The reasons: 1) Tom Ford is a big fan. (And who wouldn't like Tom Ford to be that man on the doorstep?) 2) Wearing one shows a humble ability to try something unconventional. OK, so a bow tie isn't daring in an edgy-risk way, but it sure makes a putting-yourself-out-there statement. Obviously, it has to be black, worn with white shirt and black tux. All done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
