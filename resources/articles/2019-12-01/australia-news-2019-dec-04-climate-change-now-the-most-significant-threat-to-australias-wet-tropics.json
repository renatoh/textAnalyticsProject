The grim assessment of the critical north Queensland rainforest region is outlined in an annual snapshot of the protected area prepared by the Wet Tropics Management Authority, which urges greater national and international effort to address the causes of climate change. The wet tropics world heritage area spans 450km of tropical north Queensland coastline between Cooktown and Townsville and comprises the world\u2019s oldest living rainforests and the largest area of rainforest in Australia. It also supports the highest level of biodiversity of any region in Australia, being home to 36% of Australia\u2019s mammals, 29% of Australia\u2019s frog species, 60% of Australia\u2019s butterfly species and 50% of Australia\u2019s bird species. The agency\u2019s two annual reports, one specifically on the state of the world heritage area, both warn that the conservation outlook for the region is deteriorating, with climate change seen as \u201clikely to result in widespread and substantial ecological change\u201d. \u201cClimate change is escalating as the most significant threat to the wet tropics long-term outlook, including changes to the distribution and density of endemic and specialised cool adapted rainforest species,\u201d the report says. \u201cChanges to endemic and specialised cool adapted rainforest species distribution and density having already been recorded \u2013 and some somber predictions of modelled effects are already being realised.\u201d The agency reports that after receiving new evidence of the \u201caccelerated decline of unique, endemic wet tropics animals\u201d, such as the lemuroid ringtail possum which is at risk of imminent extinction, the board released a climate impact statement and a 10-point plan for climate adaptation. \u201cThe board\u2019s call is for urgent action and investment to improve resilience and protection to give the area the best chance of withstanding extreme events and climate impacts, pending a reduction in global emissions,\u201d it said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The snapshot also warns that \u201cmore extreme and unplanned bushfires\u201d will occur in the future, posing a significant threat to the old-growth rainforest. \u201cAlthough not directly attributable to climate change, our rapidly warming climate, driven by human activities, is exacerbating every risk factor for more frequent and intense bushfires,\u201d the report says. Other threats reported by the authority include the damage being inflicted by invasive species, with feral pigs, yellow crazy ants, invasive weeds and pathogens such as myrtle rust all having an impact. Funding cuts are also listed as a threat, with the authority reporting a \u201csignificant decline in research and monitoring of the property\u201d. \u201cDespite previous historical investment in research in the area, research funding has significantly declined over recent years,\u201d the report says. Under the current National Environmental Science Program (2015-2021) commonwealth research funding investment into wet tropics rainforests was not a priority. The final threat listed by the agency is the increased demand for infrastructure like roads, dams and energy supply, \u201ccaused by a growing urban population and tourist visitor numbers, distributing visitation across a wider area\u201d. The wet tropics area, which was declared protected in 1988, was also examined in 2017 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature which carries out regular assessments of the world\u2019s 241 natural world heritage sites. The 2017 Outlook Report reported that the wet tropics region was under direct threat from \u201cinvasive plants, animals and diseases, and the high risk posed by the predicted impacts of climate change\u201d. The authority is concerned that the threat to the region\u2019s ecology could also threaten the world heritage listing, which would have a knock-on effect to the Queensland economy. \u201cClimate change is one of the most significant threats to the area and is likely to result in widespread and substantial ecological change,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis change will impact the biodiversity values underpinning the world heritage listing of the area and has the potential to affect the region\u2019s economy.\u201d A spokesman for environment minister Sussan Ley said the wet tropics was an \u201cincredibly important area and one that receives significant funding.\u201d \u201cIn addition to its annual funding, the government has further invested $9m in crazy ant eradication and the formation of a Tourism Destination Development Plan to enhance opportunities for Indigenous cultural tourism enterprises and grow appropriate eco-tourism. \u201cWe will continue to work with Queensland to protect this very important place.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
