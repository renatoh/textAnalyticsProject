Mourinho effectively issued a public challenge to Roman Abramovich to sack him after Chelsea slumped to their fourth Premier League defeat of the season on Saturday, losing 3-1 to Southampton, and the club responded by offering their manager a vote of confidence on Monday. Despite the uncertainty over his future, however, Mourinho maintains that Ferguson was aware that he could not be tempted to replace him when he left United in 2013. \u201cEvery manager in the world looks at Man United as a huge club but I wanted to come to Chelsea and we didn\u2019t bring that to the table because we were so open and he knows so much about myself,\u201d Mourinho said during an interview for a new BBC documentary, Sir Alex Ferguson: Secrets of Success. \u201cHe knew that for almost a season I want to leave Real Madrid and I want to come to Chelsea.\u201d United chose David Moyes instead and, although he was sacked before the end of his first season, Ferguson used the documentary to deny suggestions that he forced through the ill-fated appointment of the former Everton manager. Ferguson, who revealed that he would have made Ryan Giggs his assistant if he had retired six or seven years ago, added that choosing Moyes was not a mistake. \u201cWhen I announced my retirement, do you honestly believe that one man could decide the future of Manchester United?\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolute nonsense. There was a good process. They\u2019re a professional football club. They know what they\u2019re doing, the Glazers, David Gill. Jos\u00e9 was going back to Chelsea, Carlo Ancelotti was going to Real Madrid, J\u00fcrgen Klopp had signed a contract with Dortmund, Louis van Gaal was staying with Holland for the World Cup. \u201cThe other thing was I took Pep Guardiola for dinner in New York in the September and I had no idea I was ever going to retire and I said to him give me a call and tell what you\u2019re going to do. No answer. I don\u2019t think we made a mistake at all. I think we chose a good football man. He did a great job at Everton, 11 years there. We picked the right man. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work for David. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have spoken to many managers, believe me, because that\u2019s the process. We\u2019d like to have asked them what they felt about leaving a big club to go to a bigger club. To come to Manchester United. But it wasn\u2019t there for us. I think we did the best under the circumstances we were in.\u201d However, Ferguson scoffed when it was put to him that it was impossible for Moyes to succeed, pointing out that United won the title in his final season. \u201cThere\u2019s this continual thing about we left an old team and all that nonsense,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWe won the league by 11 points. It\u2019s unbelievable. The average age of my teams consistently in the 20 years when we started winning the championship was 27 to 28. Every year.\u201d Ferguson went on to reiterate his belief that Giggs has the potential to succeed Louis van Gaal as United\u2019s manager one day. Giggs is currently Van Gaal\u2019s assistant. \u201cIf Ryan Giggs had retired six or seven years ago, say he had retired at 35, quite likely I would have made him my assistant and quite likely he could have moved right into the job with the experience of being an assistant manager for me, as he\u2019s doing and helping Louis van Gaal at the moment,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cBut I would never ask a player to quit.\u201d Giggs reacted with surprise when he was told about Ferguson\u2019s comments. \u201cHe said that?\u201d he said. \u201cI obviously played until I was 40. It\u2019s obviously a completely different job, a completely different mind-set, going from playing to coaching. It would have been great for me personally to work under Sir Alex, to see how he worked behind the scenes, because you don\u2019t really see that as a player.\u201d \u2022 Sir Alex Ferguson: Secrets of Success will be on BBC1 at 10.30pm on Sunday 11 October"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
