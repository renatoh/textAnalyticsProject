Quite a few scousers wouldn't shed a single tear if they never again had to hear the Kop bawling You'll Never Walk Alone. He goes on to say Liverpool is a club that \"has long been at the heart and soul of its community\". What a load of flapdoodle. The majority of Liverpool supporters live in the home counties - if they live in England at all. Malcolm Handley Manchester Moss's investigation of the strange mores of our port city is flawed, especially if he thinks that \"the cultural heart of Liverpool\" is Anfield. His ethnocentricity is conditioned by the selective historical amnesia which all Liverpudlians suffer from. In 1884 Everton won the Liverpool Cup by tonking Earlestown in the final.
