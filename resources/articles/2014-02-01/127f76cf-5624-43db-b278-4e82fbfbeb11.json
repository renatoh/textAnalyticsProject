Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Diplomatic efforts continued into the night to resolve a three-day standoff between forces loyal to Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and anti-government protesters, who by day\u2019s end Thursday had strengthened their grip on the key central square, Independence Square, or the Maidan. \u2022 Advances by the protesters came at a terrible price, with anywhere from 39 (the health ministry figure) to more than 70 (a field medic\u2019s figure) dying in violence on Thursday. Guardian reporters saw 21 corpses in the square. Most of the deaths appeared to be from gunfire. Pictures and video emerged of security officers, including snipers, gunning down unarmed protesters. \u2022 Hundreds of protesters have been wounded since fighting broke out Tuesday. At least three security officers died Thursday. Dozens more policemen were captured by protesters and held, apparently unharmed, into the evening. It was the bloodiest day in the history of independent Ukraine. \u2022 A trio of European foreign ministers shuttled on Thursday night between Yanukovych and leaders of the protest. US vice president Joe Biden spoke with Yanukovich on the telephone. Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with Yanukovich and with the leaders of Germany and Britain. The Ukrainian military was not taking calls from the US defense department. \u2022 European foreign ministers in Brussels voted unanimously to sanction Ukrainian leaders implicated in the bloodshed, freezing their assets and denying visas. Those measures were likely to take effect within days, although their severity was tied to the course of events on the ground. \u2022 The Ukrainian parliament passed a resolution for security forces to withdraw from the square, but the withdrawal of most members of the ruling Party of Regions left the practical force of the resolution in doubt. \u2022 This latest round of clashes broke out on Tuesday. Protesters first occupied the square in November, in protest of a Yanukovych government decision, under pressure from Moscow, not to pursue an agreement to strengthen ties with the European Union. Open channels of communication between Washington and Kiev, apparently: But not wholly open: US secretary of defense Chuck Hagel has been unable to reach his Ukrainian counterpart in past days, according to Defense One: \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to connect with anybody from the defense ministry there in the Ukraine,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s been trying now for the past several days, as the violence escalated, to reach Ministry of Defense.\u201d Here\u2019s more from the Army Times report: Pentagon officials have been urging Ukrainian troops to \u201cremain on the sidelines,\u201d said Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman. Their use of force would have consequences for the relationship between the countries, he said. Hagel spoke with Lebedev on Dec. 13 and \u201cwarned Minister Lebedev not to use the armed forces of Ukraine against the civilian population in any fashion,\u201d according to a statement issued then by Pentagon spokesman Carl Woog. \u201cHe underlined the potential damage of any involvement by the military in breaking up the demonstrations and called for restraint.\u201d (via @robertcaruso) A demonstration of support for Ukraine in Poland, the neighbor to the west: (via @20committee) What\u2019s happening outside Kiev? \u201cAnti-government protesters stormed buildings, seized weapons and staged demonstrations across the western part of the country, the Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont (@petersbeaumont) reports: The most significant events outside of Kiev occurred in the western city of Lviv, close to the Polish border and a centre of Ukrainian nationalism since the Soviet era. Several thousand protesters were reported to have seized a major police barracks that had been under siege, forcing the surrender of the police inside. The regional council in the city, which has witnessed some of the most concerted anti-government actions, announced it was no longer taking orders from the central government. The announcement came hours after protesters also seized the local prosecutor\u2019s office. Interior ministry troops were also reported to be under siege behind barricades in their western region command headquarters. Fears have grown that the entire country is moving closer to widespread civil violence after a televised warning by Oleksandr Yakimenko, head of the state security service, the SBU. \u201cIn many regions of the country, municipal buildings, offices of the interior ministry, state security and the prosecutor general, army units and arms depots are being seized,\u201d he said. The SBU said 1,500 guns and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition had been seized in the last few days, though the figures could not be independently confirmed. Some opposition activists denied that weapons had been taken. Parts of the country, particularly its western cities, now appear to be in open revolt against Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s central government. Read the full piece here. Veteran Associated Press conflict reporter Yuras Karmanau is in Kiev. \u201cI saw bodies lying on the pavement,\u201d he writes. Read his description of the day in full here. When I walked out into the Maidan, clad in a helmet and a flak jacket, I saw bodies lying on the pavement. Ten in one place, another six a short walk away, five more farther away. The demonstrators were killed with precise shots to their heads or necks, the hallmarks of snipers. People were gathering around the dead, many of them weeping. Some covered the bodies with Ukrainian flags, others brought Orthodox icons. A priest conducted a remembrance service. I felt a bit sick. Many of the victims were only in their 30s and 40s, full of energy just a few hours ago. I kept asking myself: Why are they killing them? The protesters had no firearms that I could see, and snipers could have instead incapacitated them by shooting their feet or arms. If the government had hoped that the killings would intimidate protesters and force them to leave the Maidan, it was clearly a miscalculation. The carnage only fueled anger and strengthened the demonstrators\u2019 determination. \u201cThe price of freedom is too high, but Ukrainians are paying it,\u201d said Viktor Danilyuk, a 30-year-old protester. \u201cWe have no choice, the government isn\u2019t hearing us.\u201d Full piece here. The Ukrainian parliament \u2013 minus some but not all members of the president\u2019s ruling Party of Regions \u2013 has approved a resolution to pull back troops from the Maidan, the Wall Street Journal among others reports: US ambassador Geoff Pyatt congratulated the legislature on the vote on Twitter: The Guardian\u2019s Alan Yuhas notes that the parliament (the Rada) \u201chad managed to rally just enough representatives to hold an emergency session, meeting the 226-person requirement with 239 in attendance.\u201d Alan writes: They\u2019ve voted to forbid the \u201canti-terrorist operations\u201d that Yanukovych announced yesterday. The resolution also demands a cease-fire and that all security forces return to their posts. The extent to which these resolutions influence the actors in the streets has yet to be seen. Out of a total 442 seats in the Rada, only 30-some members of Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions attended. The vice-speaker Ruslan Koshulinsky presided in stead of the absent Vladimir Rybak, who\u2019s a member of the Party of Regions. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: \u2022 An uneasy quiet held in Kiev as a trio of EU foreign ministers attempted to broker a deal between the government and protesters. The diplomatic talks, which were expected to last through the night, came after a day of historic bloodshed in which between 39 and 70 protesters and at least three members of security forces were killed. \u2022 The Ukrainian interior ministry confirmed that security officers had fired live ammunition at protesters. In scenes documented on video, government troops, including snipers with long rifles, opened fire on unarmed protesters. \u201cWe are outraged by the images of Ukrainian security forces firing automatic weapons on their own people,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u2022 Security forces withdrew from Independence Square before nightfall, and protesters began rebuilding barricades destroyed in a day of fighting. Hotels served as makeshift morgues and at least one church was used as a field hospital, as protesters struggled to treat the wounded. \u2022 European Union foreign ministers agreed to impose sanctions targeting Ukrainian officials believed to be responsible for the violence. The severity of the sanctions, expected to be written into law in the next few days, was tied to the course of events on the ground. \u2022 The Polish foreign ministry said Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych had signaled a willingness to consider early elections as part of a potential deal with the opposition. The deal also reportedly would amend the Ukrainian constitution. \u2022 Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with the leaders of Britain and Germany, and all sides \u201cexpressed \u2018utmost concern\u2019 over the deadly violence in Ukraine,\u201d the Kremlin said. Earlier, a spokesman for president Vladimir Putin said \u201call responsibility\u201d for the violence \u201clies with the extremists.\u201d The Ukrainian ministry of health has revised its count of those killed in clashes since Tuesday upward to 75 dead, RIA Novosti reports. The Guardian\u2019s Alan Yuhas translates: The Ministry of Health reports 75 dead since the beginning of the clashes in Kiev. In total there were 571 injured, 363 of whom were hospitalized. Other counts have been much higher. A medic with the protesters said 70 died on Thursday alone. Russian president Vladimir Putin has spoken on the phone with German chancellor Angela Merkel and British prime minister David Cameron, Reuters reports, \u201cand they all expressed \u2018utmost concern\u2019 over the deadly violence in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\u201d Reuters: \u201cVladimir Putin stressed the critical importance of an immediate end to bloodshed, the need to take urgent measures to stabilise the situation and suppress extremist and terrorist attacks,\u201d the Kremlin said in a statement on its website. US president Barack Obama and German chancellor Angela Merkel spoke on the phone Thursday to discuss steps to end violence in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The shuttle diplomacy continues. Radoslaw Sikorski is foreign minister of Poland: Opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko says he hopes that the trio of EU ministers will be able to hammer out a roadmap later tonight, Reuters reports: \u201cWe have no clear decision yet. We hope for a result tonight,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the final decision would depend on Yanukovich. Diplomatic sources said earlier that the roadmap would include forming a temporary government. Max Seddon is in Ukraine for BuzzFeed: Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker has spoken with Bogdana Matsotska, the Ukrainian skier who pulled out of the Olympics in protest at the violence in Kiev. Matsotska told the Guardian that an International Olympic Committee move to ban black armbands was behind her decision, even as the IOC denied ordering such a ban. Shaun writes: \u201cWe wanted to wear black armbands to mourn the people who have died in Kiev, but the IOC told us it was not allowed,\u201d Matsotska said. \u201cIn these conditions it is simply not possible to compete. We don\u2019t feel comfortable here and we can\u2019t compete.\u201d The 24-year-old had already finished 27th in the women\u2019s super-G and 43rd in the giant slalom at the Games, and was due to enter the slalom competition on Friday. She was competing at her second Olympics, having represented Ukraine at the 2010 Vancouver games. [...] Matsotska and her father are mainly based in Switzerland and Austria, but said that on trips through Ukraine to renew visas in the past few months, they had dropped into the main protest encampment, known as the Maidan, in Independence Square. Now, she wants to return as soon as possible to show her support for those protesting against Yanukovych. \u201cWe are trying any way we can to get home, but we can\u2019t get tickets at the moment,\u201d she said. Her father added that the Ukrainian delegation was keen for them to stay until the end of the games, on Sunday. Read the full piece here. Diplomats in Brussels said that \u201csanctions were agreed unanimously by the foreign ministers of the 28-nation bloc, including Foreign Secretary William Hague,\u201d the Press Assiciation reports: Measures will be targeted at officials blamed for human rights violations that have occurred during the crackdown on anti-government protests, but the list of those involved has yet to be drawn up. The scope of sanctions will be adjusted according to developments on the ground. Speaking ahead of the emergency Brussels meeting, Mr Hague said that Britain condemned the bloodshed in Kiev \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d and called for an \u201cimmediate and far-reaching change\u201d in attitude of the authorities. \u201cBy permitting such action to take place, the Ukrainian government is putting itself at odds with reasonable opinion all across the world,\u201d said Mr Hague. \u201cIt is not right to describe protesters as terrorists. A great many of them are simply seeking a better future for their country.\u201d Earlier the Ukrainian ambassador to London, Volodymyr Khandogiy, was summoned to the Foreign Office for the second time in as many days to be told that the action to crush the protests was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The EU sanctions were welcomed by Labour leader Ed Miliband: The trio of EU foreign ministers \u2013 Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany, Laurent Fabius of France and Radoslaw Sikorski of Poland \u2013 will stay in Kiev overnight for a \u201cnight of difficult negotiations\u201d, Reuters quotes a Polish foreign ministry spokesman as saying. The three ministers \u201care extending their stay in Kiev to tomorrow. We face a night of difficult negotiations,\u201d spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski,who is in Kiev with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, wrote in a Twitter post. Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) catches more from Earnest\u2019s briefing, noting that the state department has already announced visa travel bans on some Ukrainian officials: White House deputy spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday that officials were assessing what steps to take against individuals who \u201ceither ordered or are responsible for\u201d the bloody crackdown on protesters over the last 48 hours. The State Department already announced visa travel bans on around 20 senior Ukrainian officials implicated in the violence, but further measures are expected in tandem with the EU. Yanukovich may be willing to call early elections to resolve the Kiev standoff, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference, Reuters reports: \u201cThe three ministers are in Kiev discussing a certain document, which gives a chance to bring an end to violence and achieve an agreement. A willingness for early elections, already this year, parliamentary as well as presidential, was agreed,\u201d Tusk said, describing the meeting with Yanukovich. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski was one of the EU delegation which met Yanukovich, along with his French and German counterparts. Tusk was also quoted as saying that the trio of ministers in Kiev are \u201cworking on a document which gives some hope of an agreement and an end to violence.\u201d Question for Earnest: What strategic interest does the United States have in Ukraine? Earnest says the \u201cbasic human rights of anybody around the globe being so flagrantly trampled\u201d is a \u201csource of great concern here at the White House.\u201d He says it\u2019s also the desire of the White House to see countries with governments that reflect the will of the people. \u201cWhat the president has been encouraging is... for the government and the opposition to sit down at the table... and try to reach a diplomatic agreement...and to have the country of Ukraine be integrated into the international community.\u201d \u201cThat is our longer-term goal, here,\u201d Earnest says. US President Barack Obama \u201cis actively considering\u201d a range of options on how to respond to violence in Ukraine, White House spokesman Josh Earnest says at the daily briefing. \u201cThe government in Ukraine has a responsibility, the primary responsibility for making sure that the violence that we\u2019ve scene does not continue.\u201d Earnest said. That\u2019s not to say that protesters are not responsible for keeping protests peaceful, he said. The official English Twitter account of the Russian foreign ministry sends out a statement attributed to Putin. The statement does not name Ukraine but declares Russia to be \u201ca peaceful democratic state.\u201d The Russian president made the statement to mark the upcoming Defender of the Fatherland Day. The full statement is here. Here\u2019s the crux: Russia is a peaceful democratic state. We are convinced that international problems and conflicts should be resolved by political rather than military means. It is mainly due to this approach that Russia has managed to stop a number of tragic developments, such as the events around the Republic of Syria. However, the world today remains unstable; the area of potential conflict is expanding. In these conditions, we should be vigilant and remain prepared to defend Russia and its citizens regardless of how the situation may develop. Therefore, the combat readiness of our Army and Navy remain the most important national security factors. Putin\u2019s mention of Syria is vague, in translation. In the original Russian, the Guardian\u2019s Alan Yuhas advises, Putin refers to \u201cdramatic\u201d developments around Syria and holds them out as an example of what Russia has by and large succeeded at stopping. A grim scene via BBC correspondent Daniel Sandford: A news conference of the EU ministers in Brussels has just begun, Leo Cendrowicz reports for the Guardian. As for the trio of ministers in Kiev, Yanukovych reportedly interrupted his meeting with them earlier to take a call from Putin. Meanwhile German chancellor Anglea Merkel also has placed a call to Yanukovych. The US state department has no daily briefing scheduled for today. White House principal deputy press secretary Josh Earnest is scheduled to brief the media at 1pm ET. EU sanctions on Ukraine are to be \u201cdrafted into law in the coming days\u201d and \u201cwill apply to those involved with ordering or orchestrating the violence,\u201d Reuters reports from Brussels: European Union foreign ministers agreed on Thursday to impose sanctions on Ukraine, including visa bans, asset freezes and restrictions on the export of anti-riot equipment, ministers and officials said. The restrictions, to be drafted into law in the coming days, will apply to those involved with ordering or orchestrating the violence in Kiev that has left nearly 60 people dead. Proposals for a ban on arms exports were dropped Reuters flashes details attributed to an EU diplomatic source of sanctions to be imposed on Ukraine, \u201cto include visa bans, asset freezes and ban on export on anti-riot gear.\u201d The \u201cscope of implementation of EU measures will be taken forward in light of developments in Ukraine,\u201d Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt tweets: The secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, echoes the White House statement urging the Ukrainian military to stay out of the conflict. The subway is at least partially working again in Kiev, writes the Guardian\u2019s Alan Yuhas (@AlanYuhas). Earlier today, Kiev mayor Vladimir Makeyenko quit the ruling party and protested the closure of the train by government security forces. Alan writes: Makeyenko, appointed mayor only a few weeks ago, also issued a video plea to parliament saying \u201c\u201cNo power is worth the cost of human lives,\u201d just as five additional members of the ruling Party of Regions resigned this morning. Reopening the subway is a logistical victory for Maidan, as more residents and supplies can reach the square. The metro was closed most of Tuesday, and key stops remain blocked at this point. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Dozens were killed and many more wounded in clashes Thursday between protesters and government forces in central Kiev in Ukraine. At nightfall, protesters held Independence Square and surrounding streets and buildings, security officers had pulled back and clashes had subsided. Protesters were rebuilding barricades destroyed in fighting during the day. \u2022 A group of three European foreign ministers was in Kiev attempting to broker a deal between the government of president Viktor Yunokovych and the opposition. The trio met for five hours with the president and was meeting with the opposition. \u2022 Reports on the number of protesters killed varied. The Kiev health department said that 39 were killed since 6 a.m. on Thursday, according to Reuters. Agence France-Presse estimated that at least 60 people were killed Thursday. A medic for the protesters said 70 were killed Thursday. The government said three officers were killed. Dozens of police officers were captured by protesters. \u2022 The Ukrainian interior ministry issued a statement confirming that police had been armed with combat weapons. Video showed government troops, including snipers, firing on protesters. \u2022 The White House issued a strong condemnation of the crackdown, calling on government forces to withdraw and for the Ukrainian military not to get involved. \u201cWe are outraged by the images of Ukrainian security forces firing automatic weapons on their own people,\u201d the statement said. \u2022 The strong White House statement conflicted sharply with statements out of Moscow, where prime minister Dmitry Medvedev urged President Yanukovych not to be a \u201cdoormat\u201d. Foreign minister Sergie Lavrov accused the EU of \u201cblackmail\u201d by threatening sanctions. A spokesman for president Vladimir Putin said \u201call responsibility\u201d for the violence \u201clies with the extremists.\u201d \u2022 European foreign ministers were meeting in Brussels to discuss possible sanctions on Ukraine. The talks could be rendered moot if the trio in ministers in Kiev succeeded in brokering an agreement. It\u2019s just before 7pm in Kiev. European Union foreign ministers are meeting now in Brussels to discuss possible sanctions on Ukraine. It\u2019s a conversation that could be rendered moot if the trio in Kiev \u2013 Fabius, Steinmeier and Sikorski \u2013 succeed in brokering even a temporary deal. In any case, \u201cThere is still no clear indication of which way the meeting will go on sanctions, with some arguing that a harder approach could push the country towards a civil war,\u201d Leo Cendrowicz reports from Brussels for the Guardian: William Hague was among the more cautious as he arrived, calling for \u201cimmediate and far-reaching change\u201d but not mentioning sanctions. Although Hollande and Merkel have called for sanctions, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Britain, Italy and the Netherlands are cautious because of concern about breaking off dialogue with the Ukrainians. An early draft of the ministers\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 says the EU will \u201cstand ready\u201d to impose sanctions. Leo reports that there\u2019s no indication yet of when the meeting might end. In Kiev, the trio of European foreign ministers met with Yanukovych for almost five hours of talks before meeting with the opposition, Guardian Europe editor Ian Traynor (@traynorbrussels) reports. The Obama administration has released a scathing statement condemning Ukrainian security forces for firing on the protesters. The Guardian\u2019s Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) passes on the statement from press secretary Jay Carney: We are outraged by the images of Ukrainian security forces firing automatic weapons on their own people. We urge President Yanukovych to immediately withdraw his security forces from downtown Kyiv and to respect the right of peaceful protest, and we urge protesters to express themselves peacefully. We urge the Ukrainian military not to get involved in a conflict that can and should be resolved by political means. The use of force will not resolve the crisis -- clear steps must be taken to stop the violence and initiate meaningful dialogue that reduces tension and addresses the grievances of the Ukrainian people. The United States will work with our European allies to hold those responsible for violence accountable and to help the Ukrainian people get a unified and independent Ukraine back on the path to a better future. Geoff Pyatt is US ambassador to Ukraine (and yes that\u2019s Senator John McCain on the right on an earlier visit): After placing all blame for the violence on the protesters, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending an envoy to Ukraine at the request of President Viktor Yanukovich, Reuters reports, picking up a report from Russian news agencies: \u201cPutin decided to send (Russian) human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin on this mission,\u201d state-run RIA quoted Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, as saying after a telephone conversation between Putin and Yanukovich. Itar-Tass reported that Lukin was on his way to the airport for a flight to Kiev. Reuters has more on Lukin: Lukin, 76, is a former senior member of the Russian parliament from a liberal party and a former ambassador to the United States. His 10-year stint as Russia\u2019s human rights commissioner is due to end shortly. Lukin \u201chas very rich experience of diplomatic service, substantial authority among rights activists, and has led a large opposition party\u201d, the Kremlin said in its brief statement. Putin sees the events in Kiev as \u201can attempt to carry out a coup\u201d, a Putin spokesman said Tuesday. The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker reported: \u201cThe president believes that all responsibility for what is happening inUkraine now lies with the extremists,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman. Peskov said Putin and Yanukovych spoke on the phone on \u201cvery very late on Tuesday night\u201d, as the violence was escalating, but denies that Putin gave Yanukovych any orders or advice on how to act. There is no doubting whom Moscow blames for the violence, however. The European ministers were about to meet with opposition leaders following their meeting with Yanukovych, according to a tweet by the Polish foreign minister quoted by Reuters: Polish foreign minister said on Thursday he was about to meet Ukraine\u2019s opposition to discuss a proposed deal with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. \u201cAbout to start a meeting with the opposition so as to test proposed agreement,\u201d Radoslaw Sikorski said on his Twitter account, after meeting Yanukovich and the German and French foreign ministers. An ominous lull, as seen by correspondents from the Telegraph and BBC: We\u2019ve just published an updated news story, from Ian Traynor in Kiev and Shaun Walker in Sochi. \u201cScores of people have been killed and many more injured in what has become the bloodiest day in modern Ukrainian history,\u201d they write: The violence started shortly before 9am when protesters armed with axes, knives, truncheons and corrugated iron shields advanced on to a bridge in the centre of the Ukranian capital and drove riot police back from Independence Square. Within an hour, the area surrounding the Ukrania hotel, which had been under the control of riot police, fell to the protesters. The riot police lines dissolved as they were bussed away to be replaced by the feared \u201cBerkut\u201d special forces. Kiev soon became a battleground. Dozens of people \u2013 some injured, some dying and some dead \u2013 were dragged away on planks of wood or makeshift stretchers. Others were simply dragged along the ground on their backs, still under fire. The lobby of the hotel transformed into a blood-smeared makeshift medical centre. Some youths had what appeared to be gunshot wounds. Agence France-Presse estimated at least 60 people have been killed. On Thursday afternoon, Ukraine\u2019s acting interior minister, Vitaly Zakharchenko, issued a statement confirming that police had been armed with combat weapons. \u201cI signed an order and police have been given combat weapons, which will be used in accordance with the law,\u201d Zakharchenko said in a statement published on the ministry website. He urged protestors to hand in their weapons and opposition leaders to condemn radical actions. Read the full piece here. The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland are still in Kiev after holding separate meetings with President Yanukovych\u2019s government and opposition leaders. They had been expected to fly back to Brussels in time for the meeting on sanctions. But the meeting is due to get underway without them. Germany\u2019s foreign office tweeted an image of three ministers arriving for the meeting with Yanukovych. WARNING: graphic image. A young medic, Olesya Zhukovskaya, 21, was shot in the neck by a sniper, according to the protest group Euromaidan. Her most recent post on the social networking site Vkontakte read: \u201cI\u2019m dying\u201d. She was photographed clutching her neck as it bled onto her white coat emblazoned with a red cross. Her message appeared to have cross posted to Twitter. Her condition is unkown. Zhukovyskaya was photographed clutching her neck as it bled onto her white coat emblazoned with a red cross. Journalist Olaf Koens paid tribute to all the medical volunteers in Kiev. The Russian news agency Itar-Tass has more of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s criticism of the threatened western sanctions against Ukraine. It quotes him saying: The opposition cannot or does not want to dissociate itself from extremists ... America\u2019s sanctions encourage rioters. The EU is also trying to discuss sanctions and sending missions to Ukraine. Such actions can be considered a blackmail. We\u2019re worried about the Western capitals influencing the situation in the country. The Kiev Post is reporting as many as 42 killed in today\u2019s clashes alone. It said: Kiev Post journalists either saw for themselves or had the following body counts confirmed to them by medical personnel: 15 at Kozatsky Hotel, 12 at Ukraine Hotel, 7 at the central post office, and 8 on Khreshchatyk Street. Dr. Olha Bohomolets, one of the attending physicians to 12 fatal gunshot victims at Ukraine Hotel, said that the victims were shot with high-precision rifles and powerful ammunition that broke their bones. Foreign ministers are gathering in Brussels to discuss imposing sanctions and arms embargo against Ukraine. A draft text of the proposed sanctions has been passed to Reuters. It says: In light of the deteriorating situation, the EU has decided as a matter of urgency on targeted measures against those responsible for violence and use of excessive force... At the same time, member states have decided to implement an arms embargo and a ban on equipment used for internal repression ... Any further escalation, including the introduction of a state of emergency, or the use of the armed forces against protesters must be avoided. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, arriving for the EU meeting, condemned the killing of more protesters in Kiev, calling it \u201cutterly unacceptable and indefensible.\u201d \u201cBy permitting such actions to take place, the Ukrainian government is putting itself at odds with reasonable opinion all across the world,\u201d he told reporters. On sanctions, Hague said it was important there was a strong international response, but also that \u201cwe promote ultimately a peaceful settlement of these issues and retain our capability to do so.\u201d One EU diplomat told Reuters that a group of countries, including Greece, Portugal, Spain, Britain and the Netherlands, were cautious about going ahead with sanctions because of concern about breaking off dialogue with the Ukrainians. More graphic footage shows protesters in Kiev coming under fire. Warning: the following clip shows protesters being wounded and bodies being dragged away. It doesn\u2019t show the source of the shots. Ukraine\u2019s Interior ministry has confirmed that the security forces have opened fire against protesters. In a statement quoted by Russia Today, it shots were fired in self-defence. On February 20, from the windows of Kiev conservatory, unknown gunmen opened fire at law-enforcement officials. Aiming to save lives and the health of the security forces, it was decided to relocate the troops to safer spots and according to the current legislation, to use firearms as self-defense. Britain has summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to London to protest against the crackdown in Kiev. In a statement it said the Europe minister David Lidington \u201cexpressed extreme concern over the reports of further violence and deaths, and made clear that action against peaceful protestors on Independence Square is unacceptable\u201d. More video footage has emerged purporting to police marksman shooting at protesters. The footage from Radio Svoboda backs up Ian Traynor\u2019s account (see previous two posts). Commenting on the clip, Traynor said: \u201cI saw these guys across the street from where I was watching.\u201d He added: \u201cThe city centre now belongs to the opposition. For now it\u2019s quiet, and there\u2019s an absolute frenzy of barricade building, involving young and old, men and women.\u201d Ian Traynor has more on the deathtoll today. The guardian alone can confirm 21 dead, but it is likely to be much higher. I counted 12 corpses in the makeshift morgue, but a doctor said there were 15 here. My colleague Harriet Salem counted nine bodies in a different part of town. The Guardian\u2019s Ian Traynor in Kiev witnessed four police snipers, two of whom fired live rounds at protesters. \u201cI saw marksmen firing from automatic weapons with telescopic sights,\u201d Ian said in a telephone update. He also reported seeing the bodies of 12 named protesters who had been bought to a makeshift morgue in the lobby of his hotel. All had been shot, according to medics. Kiev is out on the streets at the moment building new barricades. Human chains have been formed, massive barricades have been built ... to try to prevent the return of the police. Ian pointed out that policeman had also been killed by gunfire in recent days, but it was unclear whether protesters had used firearms today. I watched hundreds, if not over a thousand, of protesters retake that part of town this morning. They were armed with axes, sledge hammers, crow bars, bits of metal, bits of wood, and knives. I didn\u2019t see any firearms, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any. He said some of the protesters were kitted out like \u201cparamilitaries\u201d. Describing the makeshift morgue in the Ukraina hotel, Ian said: \u201cThere are 12 corpses laid out under white sheets. All of them named.\u201d A medic in charge told Ian that all of the dead had been killed by gunshot wounds. \u201cA lot of it was single shot wounds to the head, the neck and the heart. So that would tend to corroborate reports of sharpshooters,\u201d Ian said. There are figures circulating of around 35 people killed today, Ian said. If confirmed this would be highest deathtoll so far in the recent upsurge in violence, and the worst in Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet history. Ian also confirmed reports that protesters have captured dozens of police. There must be quite a bit of dissatisfaction in the police ranks. Around 50 police either surrendered or were captured and were marched off. Some of them were requiring medical treatment. Priests were involved in leading them away to field hospitals. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Dozens of people have been killed and injured in renewed clashes in Kiev that have shattered a ceasefire agreement that only held for a few hours. Central Kiev erupted in battles, smoke, grenades and gunfire on Thursday morning as bands of young male protesters drove riot police lines back from Independence Square and took control over a much larger swath of territory. President Yanukovych has blamed the latest violence on the protesters, accusing them of using firearms against the police. A statement from his office said. \u201cThey are shooting to kill. The number of dead and injured among police officers is dozens.\u201d Protesters say the police have fired multiple live rounds, a claim that appeared to be supported by video and photographic evidence. Russia continues to use aggressive rhetoric about the crisis. Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev urged President Yanukovych not to be a \u201cdoormat\u201d. Foreign minister Sergie Lavrov accused the EU of \u201cblackmail\u201d by threatening sanctions. Three European foreign ministers are in Kiev for separate talks with opposition leaders and President Yanukovych\u2019s government, in an effort to end the bloodshed. Later today European foreign minsters will discuss imposing sanctions on Ukraine\u2019s leaders. A senior municipal official in Kiev is reported to have resigned from President Yanukovych\u2019s Party of the Regions, over a decision to close the metro system. Interfax reported that city boss Vladimir Makeyenko has resigned from the ruling party and ordered the metro to be reopened after it was closed to stop protesters reinforcing Independence Square from outside. The EU and the US are threatening targeted sanctions against Ukranian officials they hold responsible for the violence in Kiev that has killed at least 26 people and injured more than 200. In a foretaste of the broader package of sanctions under consideration, the US announced on Wednesday that it had imposed visa travel bans on around 20 senior members of the Ukrainian government. Barack Obama has sharply criticised Russian support for the crackdown in Ukraine, calling for a transitional government in Kiev and personally accusing Vladimir Putin of failing to respect basic freedoms in both countries. In his most explicit comments yet on alleged Kremlin involvement, Obama said: \u201cOur goal is to make sure that the people of Ukraine are able to make decisions for themselves about their future ... There are times, I hope, where Russia will recognise that over the long term they should be on board with those values and interests as well. Right now there are times where we have strong disagreements.\u201d A senior municipal official in Kiev is reported to have resigned from President Yanukovych\u2019s Party of the Regions, over a decision to close the metro system. Interfax reported that city boss Vladimir Makeyenko has resigned from the ruling party and ordered the metro to be reopened. It was closed in an attempt to stop protesters reinforcing Independence Square from outside. Earlier the head of the metro system had threatened to resign if the system was not reopened. On Wednesday David Dalton, Ukraine analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, urged those watching the crisis to keep an eye on Ukraine\u2019s political elite over the coming days. \u201cKey to watch is if any elements of state security, the main oligarchs, Party of Regions members or Communists start to distance themselves from Yanukovych,\u201d he said in emailed analysis of the crisis. Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, has criticised the EU\u2019s threat of sanctions against Ukraine, as \u201cblackmail\u201d, according to a snap update by Reuters, citing RIA Novosti. And foreign ministry spokesman, Alexander Lukashevich, said the threats were inappropriate and would only aggravate the confrontation. European foreign ministers will discuss sanctions at an emergency meeting in Brussels this afternoon. In a briefing note on the meeting the EU said: \u201cAll possible options will be explored, including restrictive measures against those responsible for human rights violations, violence and the use of excessive force.\u201d Ian Traynor reports 12 corpses in Kiev\u2019s Ukraina Hotel. Earlier, Ian reported how the latest clashes unfolded. Here\u2019s how his report started: Central Kiev erupted in battles, smoke, grenades and gunfire on Thursday morning as bands of young male protesters drove riot police lines back from Independence Square and took control over a much larger swath of territory. Shortly before 9am volleys of smoke and stun grenades as well as what sounded like automatic gunfire rang through Kiev as police initially sought to stem the offensive. Youths armed with axes, knives, truncheons and corrugated iron shields advanced on the police on a bridge behind the square that had been set alight. The common riot police lines dissolved as they were bussed away, to be replaced by \u201cBerkut\u201d (police special forces). A large area surrounding the Ukraina hotel, which an hour earlier had been under the control of riot police, fell to the young protesters. Dozens of wounded were dragged away on planks of wood, on makeshift stretchers, or dragged along the ground on their backs The EU and the US has expressed alarm at this morning\u2019s bloodshed. A joint statement from US Ambassador in Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt and his EU counterpart, Jan Tombinski, said: The EU and US ambassadors to Ukraine express grave concern at the resumption of violence in Kyiv and urge the sides to return to a cease fire. A meaningful dialogue must be established immediately to address the concerns of the Ukrainian people and prevent further loss of life. The protection of human lives should be the highest priority at this moment. European commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has also pleaded for an end to further bloodshed. Moscow has been making more ominous noises, according to our correspondent Shaun Walker. Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday that President Yanukovych should not be a \u201cdoormat\u201d, in what seemed the latest words from Moscow urging the Ukrainian authorities to crack down. \u201cWe need partners who are in good shape and for the authorities that work in Ukraine to be legitimate and effective, so that people don\u2019t wipe their feet on them like a doormat,\u201d said Medvedev in televised remarks. In the Olympic village in Sochi, Ukrainian athletes added black armbands to the Ukrainian flags hanging from their balconies, a day after the IOC told them they were not allowed to wear the armbands in competition. A Ukrainian skier, Bogdana Matsotka, and her coach have pulled out of the games in protest at the use of force in Kiev. The head of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, told Interfax that if the situation continues to deteriorate, there is a possibility of the region separating from Ukraine. Crimea, with its largely ethnic-Russian population, is staunchly pro-Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, if the country collapses\u201d said Konstantinov, on the possibility of secession. \u201cEverything is heading in that direction.\u201d President Yanukovych\u2019s office has blamed the latest violence on the protesters. A statement from Yanukovych\u2019s office quoted by Reuters said: \u201cThey (the protesters) went on to the offensive. They are working in organised groups. They are using firearms, including sniper rifles. They are shooting to kill. The number of dead and injured among police officers is dozens,\u201d the statement on the presidential website said.\u201d A Reuters photographer counted 21 bodies in civilian clothes in three places on the square, a few hundred metres from the presidency. That raised the death toll since Tuesday to at least 43. Other local media have put the death toll as high as 50 in the latest clashes alone. New video footage appears to confirm that police have used firearms in the latest clashes. It cannot be independently verified at this stage. Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Carl Bildt, says European observers have confirmed that live ammunition has been used. More Ukrainian athletes have left the winter Olympics in Sochi, according to the BBC\u2019s Richard Conway citing the Olympic committee. It suggested some 20 athletes had left. Earlier a Ukrainian skier said she was leaving in protest at the crackdown. Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Carl Bildt, has expressed alarm at the latest clashes in Ukraine. Meanwhile, another source has confirmed that meeting of three European foreign ministers with President Yanukovych is going ahead. \u201cThey are meeting him now,\u201d a diplomat told Reuters, contradicting earlier reports that the three ministers - from Poland, Germany and France - had left for security reasons. Update: Germany\u2019s foreign office has also confirmed the meeting is taking place. Earlier they met opposition leaders, include Vitali Klitschko. On Wednesday\u2019s Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry claimed the security forces were not using firearms. The latest photographs and reports suggest otherwise. Protesters have also been photographed with guns. The Telegraph\u2019s Roland Oliphant says it is difficult to say whether protesters have fired back at the security services. But there are reports that at least one policeman was killed in Thursday\u2019s battle. Confusion abounds. There are conflicting reports about that meeting of European foreign ministers with President Yanukovych. A presidential aide has just told AP that the meeting is underway, after a diplomatic source told Reuters that the three ministers had left for security reasons. We will try to get a more definitive line soon. There are varying reports of more deaths and injuries, but no official update from the ministry of health. Christopher Miller, editor of the Kiev Post, reported 35 deaths in four separate locations. The BBC\u2019s Duncan Crawford, confirmed five dead in the Ukraine hotel. The Telegraph\u2019s Roland Oliphant reported 10 dead in Independence Square. Update: This report turned out to be false So much more diplomacy .... those three European foreign ministers have left Kiev for security reasons, without seeing President Yanukovych. \u201cThey have left. They did not see the President for security reasons,\u201d said a diplomatic source told Reuters. The three ministers - from Poland, Germany and France - had been due to see Yanukovych in efforts to promote a political compromise to the crisis convulsing the country, now in its third month. The French embassy in Kiev confirmed to AP that the meeting with Yanukovych had been cancelled. A Ukrainian alpine skier and her coach have pulled out of the Sochi Games in protest at the authorities\u2019 deadly use of force against the protests in Kiev, AFP reports. Bogdana Matsotska and her coach Oleg Matsotskiy, who is also her father, said they were \u201coutraged\u201d by the refusal of President Viktor Yanukovych to favour dialogue. \u201cIn a sign of protest... against the bandit-like actions against protesters, we are taking no further part in the Sochi Olympics in 2014,\u201d Oleg Matsotskiy wrote on his Facebook page in a statement in the name of himself and his daughter. International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams confirmed that the pair had pulled out of the Games after the violence in Ukraine. On Wednesday the committee banned Ukrainian competitors at the Sochi winter Games from wearing black armbands to commemorate the deaths of protesters and police in Kiev. Protesters have captured dozens of policeman and up to eight people have been killed, according to the latest reports and images from central Kiev. AP reported seeing the bodies of several protesters at the edge of the protest camp. A medic for the protesters, Bohdan Soloviy, says eight protesters were killed by gunfire on Thursday as demonstrators tried to take control of a building near the encampment. In a statement published early Thursday, the Ukrainian Health Ministry said 28 people have died and 287 have been hospitalized during the two days of street violence. Protesters, who have set up a medical care facility in a downtown cathedral, say the numbers are significantly higher. Ukrainian police said Thursday that more than 20 officers have been wounded by gunfire in the capital. A statement from the Interior Ministry on Thursday said the gunfire appeared to be coming from the national music conservatory, which is on the edge of the downtown square housing an extensive protest tent camp. It did not say when the officers were wounded, but added that they were receiving treatment on Thursday. Also Thursday, the parliament building was evacuated because of fears protesters were preparing to storm it, said parliament spokeswoman Irina Karnelyuk. The renewed clashes despite the declaration of truce follow days of violence, the most deadly since protests kicked off three months ago after President Yanukovych shelved an association agreement with the European Union in favour of closer ties with Russia. Political and diplomatic manoeuvring has continued, with both Moscow and the West eager to gain influence over this former Soviet republic. Three EU foreign ministers from Germany, France and Poland are in Kiev Thursday to speak with both sides before an emergency EU meeting in Brussels to consider sanctions against those responsible for the recent violence in Ukraine. Protesters have gained the the upper hand in scenes of \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d in Kiev, according to the Guardian\u2019s Ian Traynor. He describes seeing 30 wounded people from the latest clashes as shots rang out. \u201cIt\u2019s absolute chaos here: a lot of gunfire, a lot of grenades, a lot of explosions, a lot of smoke. I\u2019ve seen dozens of injured being dragged away along the street.\u201d Radical protesters have moved into territory previously occupied by the security forces, including police snipers, Ian said. The demonstrators have the upper hand and they have driven the police back up a street called Instytutska, several hundred metres. In front of me there are vehicles blazing on fire, and the protesters are taking them apart and adding them to the new barricades. So we have a new front line, it appears. Ian speculated that the presence of European ministers in Kiev may explain the police withdrawal. It would appear that the riot police were told to back off and not to inflict too many casualties. It may be political, with three European foreign ministers in town to see President Yanukovych, that the authorities want to show that they are not provoking violence. Personally I\u2019ve seen at least 30 wounded. I\u2019ve seen people with gunshots wounds to the stomach with a lot of blood. I would expect deaths, but I can\u2019t confirm any ... It is turning more violent with a more radical edge to the protests. Opposition leaders seem to be losing control of that more radical flank. Protesters appear to be back in control of Independence Square, according to live footage from Kiev. Protesters have captured five members of the security forces, according to Christopher Miller, the editor of the Kiev Post, in one of a series of dramatic updates on the latest violence. Khreschatyk hotel is marked on this map, Europe Square is to the north-east of the hotel. Protesters are back in control of Independence Square after the latest renewed clashes with the police, according to several journalists in Kiev. There are also unconfirmed reports of casualties from this morning\u2019s violence. Others also report that the truce is now effectively over. Welcome to more live coverage of the crisis in Ukraine as renewed clashes in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square threaten to shatter a truce aimed at ending the country\u2019s worst violence in its post-Soviet history. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments: There have been new clashes in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square with reports of protesters throwing petrol bombs at police using water cannon. The clashes test an uneasy truce agreed to end the latest spate of violence. President Viktor Yanukovych announced the agreement with the opposition which he said would enable \u201cthe start to negotiations with the aim of ending bloodshed, and stabilising the situation in the state in the interests of social peace\u201d. Ukraine remains highly volatile and unpredictable, according to Ian Trayor in Kiev. The country is now on the brink, with a recalcitrant president, seemingly egged on by Moscow, digging in his heels and unleashing massive force while the opposition is becoming more radicalised and inclined towards armed resistance. \u201cThe people either have to rise up, or if there is a big crackdown, they will go underground as partisans,\u201d said Andrei Poznyakov, 23. \u201cThis president is incapable of creating a decent situation for people.\u201d Whether the violence that left more than two dozen dead and hundreds wounded will shock the two sides back into compromise or spawn riskier polarisation is not clear. A statement on Yanukovych\u2019s website late on Wednesday said he had agreed a \u201ctruce\u201d with opposition leaders before \u201cthe start to negotiations with the aim of ending bloodshed\u201d, but previous talks have collapsed with both sides blaming the other for the escalation. The EU and the US are threatening targeted sanctions against Ukranian officials they hold responsible for the violence in Kiev that has killed at least 26 people and injured more than 200. In a foretaste of the broader package of sanctions under consideration, the US announced on Wednesday that it had imposed visa travel bans on around 20 senior members of the Ukrainian government. Barack Obama has sharply criticised Russian support for the crackdown in Ukraine, calling for a transitional government in Kiev and personally accusing Vladimir Putin of failing to respect basic freedoms in both countries. In his most explicit comments yet on alleged Kremlin involvement, Obama said: \u201cOur goal is to make sure that the people of Ukraine are able to make decisions for themselves about their future ... There are times, I hope, where Russia will recognise that over the long term they should be on board with those values and interests as well.
