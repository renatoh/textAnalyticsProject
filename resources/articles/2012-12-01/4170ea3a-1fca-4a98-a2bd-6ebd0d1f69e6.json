For now he knows much better, and with that in mind, his recent high-profile trip to India was a great success. Over six days he hustled for business, addressed the Indian stock exchange, rode a bicycle around the Gate of India in Mumbai and survived a televised encounter with India's equivalent of Jonathan Ross. Another giant leap for Brand Boris. Still things didn't go entirely smoothly. Came the day when the mayoral party, on its way to do a publicity thing at a welfare project, was urged by the accompanying reporters to stop so that the mayor could be filmed at a shanty town. No we can't stop, said the mayoral contingent. We won't. We haven't got time. So the party trundled on in their 4x4 vehicles, past the poverty and the squalor. And within the hour, the mayor had a new nickname; Boris Johnson, Slumdodge Millionaire. \u2022 Joyous rebellion, meanwhile, infects the Political Studies Association awards ceremony at Church House in central London. Assumptions are mocked, the beleaguered offered comfort. As she collects her award for broadcaster of the year, BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders goes out of her way to namecheck the troubled Newsnight and thank Helen Boaden, the corporation's head of news who controversially \"stood aside\" during the tumult of the Savile fiasco. When Jon Snow announces the final lifetime achievement award of the evening, the cheery recipient is Lord Patten, chair of the BBC Trust and the man assailed by politicians of a certain hue \u2013 and, of course, the red-topped media \u2013 for his handling of the Savile tsunami. And to politician of the year: step forward John Bercow \u2013 aka the Speaker so many Tories and so many in the rightwing press just love to hate. Bercow even cracks jokes about his wife and tweeting. To the winners, glass baubles; to the haters, a one-fingered salute. \u2022 A good night too for the juggernaut that is Have I Got News for You, now entering its 44th series. It takes the award for best political satire, and jubilant producer Jo Bunting reflects on the guests who have hosted the programme. \"Some of the politicians have done it really well, delivering the jokes with energy and timing,\" she says. By contrast: \"Some have been Neil Kinnock.\" \u2022 And a very good night for Margaret Hodge, who receives the biggest cheer of the evening from hacks, politicians and political theorists as she collects the award for parliamentarian of the year. And what triggers the enthusiasm? Her longevity as MP for Barking? Her defeat of the threat from the BNP? No. It is the defenestration of officials from Amazon and Starbucks who appeared before her public accounts select committee to explain their attitudes towards paying UK income tax. The Church House audience cheered through a clip showing Amazon's director of public policy, Andrew Cecil, having his ears boxed by Hodge in high dudgeon. It won't fix the finances in isolation, but it raises morale and it's a start. \u2022 Who'd be Starbucks \u2013 assailed from left and right and picketed at its HQ by unions accusing the company of failing to pay the living wage? No wonder the multinational has turned to City PR firefighters Finsbury for some help with reputation management. According to PR Week, the man with the plan is David Henderson, a veteran of No 10 who specialised in economics, finance and foreign policy, and prepped Gordon Brown and Big Dave for prime minister's questions. He also served as private secretary for the PM's first budget and during the Libya conflict. He still may not be able to rescue his clients from the stocks. \u2022 Finally, the editor of the Church Times, Paul Handley, is working from home after injuring his knee when kneeling to pray in a cathedral. \"It was actually in the shrine of St Alban, so that's the last time he gets asked to intercede for healing,\" he tells us. An event like that can try one's faith. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
