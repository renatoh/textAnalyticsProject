Small groups of tourists have visited New Orleans, the city most affected by the hurricane, and tourism has been the first industry to start recovering. 'New Orleans is open and the tourism areas are in wonderful condition. By New Year it will reclaim its place as one of the greatest tourist destinations in the world,' said Stephen Perry, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors' Bureau. The city's main attractions, including the historic French port, the French Quarter and Arts District, are undamaged, and many cultural institutions, top restaurants and a third of hotels have already reopened, with 22,000 hotel rooms to be available by January. Other hotels are using the dearth of tourists as an opportunity to refurbish and Perry predicted 'a more fresh and modern New Orleans, built back better than before' by the spring. Before Katrina, the city had 484,000 residents, and officials hope 250,000 will return over the next few months, with tourism workers leading the way. The rest of Louisiana is operating as usual, as is most of Mississippi, except its coast. Haley Barbour, the state's governor, said coastal holidays may not be possible until April, and only three of the 12 major coastal casinos have reopened. He hoped that tourists would continue to visit golf courses and music-related sites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
