They are joined on a diverse shortlist by a new visitor centre at Chatham\u2019s historic naval dockyard, a little brick tower of six apartments in east London and a gargantuan complex for the City of Glasgow College \u2013 the second year running that the young institution has made the shortlist. Last year, the handsome riverside campus for its maritime faculty was designed by Reiach and Hall and Michael Laird. Now the further education college is back in the spotlight with a project by the same architects, who have squeezed an entire town into a 60,000-sq-metre building in the city centre. Sharing a similar stripped back architectural language, with grids of crisp aluminium mullions and marching colonnades of sharp white concrete columns, the \u00a3162m 10-storey complex houses everything from salons and industrial kitchens to film studios and aircraft cabins to train its 30,000 students in myriad technical and vocational skills. Arranged around a vast atrium and an external courtyard, with a high street frontage and a big public staircase spilling on to a planned park, this gleaming temple to practical skills has the noble civic presence worthy of a small national parliament. While the campus trumpets its arrival for miles around, you would be forgiven for not knowing that Richard Rogers had added a \u00a3135m extension to the British Museum: 70% of it is underground and off-limits to the public. Cleverly shoehorned into the museum\u2019s north-west armpit, sandwiched between seven listed buildings, the World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre provides enough space to bring the museum\u2019s entire collection together on the Bloomsbury site for the first time. Doing for the back-of-house what Norman Foster did for the front with his Great Court in 2000, the project provides light-flooded conservation studios as well as a new 1,100-sq-metre column-free exhibition hall \u2013 not forgetting the biggest truck-lift in Europe to ferry chunks of antiquity down into the storage vaults, the size of 14 Olympic swimming pools. It is open-heart surgery on an epic scale. A similarly surgical approach has been deployed by the small architecture firm Baynes and Mitchell at the 18th-century dockyard in Chatham, Kent. They have brought a deft touch to the \u00a39.5m transformation of a group of listed shipbuilding sheds into a new naval history visitor attraction, Command of the Oceans. A slender black entrance pavilion has been inserted into a gap between the white sheds, playfully continuing the irregularly pitched rooftops of its neighbours and leading visitors into an atmospheric sequence of spaces, gradually ramping down to reveal the prize haul: the ancient timbers of HMS Namur, hidden beneath the floorboards since 1834. Crumbling layers of history are also to be found below the wooden deck of Hastings\u2019 new seaside pier, brought back to life as a minimalist blank canvas by dRMM Architects. Eschewing the usual gaudy kiss-me-quick clutter, the \u00a314.2m project \u2013 partly crowdfunded by a local campaign \u2013 provides a powerfully stark platform over the water that allows you to inhale the sea breeze and take in the view. A simple stepped pavilion contains a cafe and visitor centre, from the roof of which you can survey the lively events that have populated this new public stage since it opened. Housing makes this year\u2019s shortlist as a model example of how to increase density on a leftover site in the middle of a conventional residential London street. Barretts Grove, by Groupwork and Amin Taha, is a stack of six spacious flats in Stoke Newington, built in cross-laminated timber and wrapped in a skin of perforated brickwork. The cartoonish air is completed by the cheery addition of surreal wicker basket balconies protruding into the street. Finally, the smallest project on the list is perhaps the most perfectly formed of them all. On a long, narrow infill site in Ladbroke Grove, 6a Architects have crafted a studio for fashionable photographer Juergen Teller that combines echoes of the site\u2019s industrial past with a meticulously wrought present. Built with a simple palette of exposed white blockwork, board-marked concrete and brass fittings, the project is composed as a sequence of three volumes interspersed with cloistered courtyard gardens, inspired by London bombsites with wildflowers bursting through the cracked concrete ground. Light wells, windows and peephole hatches provide glimpses through the site, with a real sense of stagecraft. The one surprising omission from the shortlist is Tate Modern\u2019s new Switch House, the twisting brick ziggurat by Herzog &amp; de Meuron that looms behind Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s power station like a defensive flak tower, housing a series of spiralling spaces within. It is a bitter irony that its curtain-twitching neighbour, Neo Bankside, made the Stirling shortlist in 2015, as a cluster of luxury flats whose residents now want the Tate\u2019s viewing gallery to be shut down. If the prize is to recognise civic spirit, the value of education and the elegant synthesis of a fiendishly complex set of requirements, then City of Glasgow College is the standout champion. At the other end of the scale, for sheer architectural craft alone, Teller\u2019s studio is hard to match. Barretts Grove, London, by Groupwork + Amin Taha Saluting the street with a jaunty rack of wicker-clad balconies, this tiny block of six apartments is an essay in how leftover sites on residential streets can be intensified. Located next door to a primary school, it has an appropriately fairytale quality with its pitched roof, over which the oversized brickwork pattern runs like wallpaper. The flats themselves are cleverly planned, with well-proportioned rooms, views out in both directions and the structural timber walls left exposed, as if they were part of a giant plywood model. British Museum\u2019s World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre, London, by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners An iceberg of an extension, this 18,000-sq-metre complex of storage and conservation studios is mostly hidden away underground. It meets the street with a polite blank frontage, where wafer-thin panels of Portland stone and planks of cast glass create a horizontal rhythm in contrast to the verticals of its neoclassical parent. It is, no doubt, a boon to the museum, but there\u2019s something lacking in the pure functionality of the new exhibition hall. An efficient machine for doing a complex job, but could do with a little more magic and finesse. Command of the Oceans for Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent, by Baynes and Mitchell Architects Standing in the middle of the zig-zagging rooftops of a group of listed sheds like a keenly sharpened pencil, the black zinc entrance pavilion is a brilliantly judged move, bringing visitors into a soaring top-lit hall, where a slender scissor truss echoes the 18th-century structures nearby. Exploiting the existing sloping floors of the shipbuilding halls to lead people down beneath the floorboards, the project is a masterclass in how to intervene in a listed structure, striking just the right balance between preservation and addition. City of Glasgow College\u2019s City Campus, by Reiach and Hall Architects and Michael Laird Architects A project of mind-boggling complexity and astonishing ingenuity, this city centre campus \u2013 previously scattered across 11 buildings \u2013 brings innumerable different departments (each with hugely demanding technical requirements) together for the first time, allowing new collaborations between students and staff. These unwieldy, contractor-led, public-private financed projects too often result in grim sheds, but this project \u2013 together with its riverside cousin, shortlisted last year \u2013 shows how they can be generously designed, finely built and stand with a civic presence. It is a testament to a client with real vision. Hastings Pier, Sussex, by dRMM Architects The spectacular fire in 2010 might have been the best thing to happen to the derelict Hastings Pier, given that it led to this smart new replacement. A silvery wooden deck floating above the sea, it has been designed as a blank canvas where people and activities bring the colour \u2013 which they have, in droves. Part of the ongoing revival of the seaside town, it was realised with the help of \u00a312m of lottery money and the sale of shares to more than 3,000 people, giving a sense of local ownership from the beginning. Photography Studio for Juergen Teller, London, by 6a architects The kind of workspace that would make you never want to leave the office, it\u2019s not surprising that photographer Juergen Teller wants to move into his new studio. Retaining fragments of the former builders\u2019 yard on the site, the place has the air of an inhabited ruin, overlaid with a refined structure of slender concrete beams, blockwork walls and cast in situ concrete walls of rare quality. Originally imagined as a place for pre- and post-production, it now plays the role of inspiration and backdrop to Teller\u2019s shoots. \u2022 The winner of the 2017 RIBA Stirling prize will be announced on 31 October at the Roundhouse, London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
