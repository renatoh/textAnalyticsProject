That alone will offer John Toshack comfort as the Wales manager surveys the fall-out from the back-to-back defeats that have brought an end to hopes of reaching the World Cup finals. There is certainly no disgrace in losing in this fashion to a Germany side replete with experience and blessed with the talents of Michael Ballack. The Germany captain's wonderful 30-yard shot in the 11th minute set the tone on a night when Wales were left to rue Ashley Williams's own-goal three minutes into the second half and a couple of moments either side of the interval that might easily have taken the match on a different course. Robert Enke's superb one-handed save from Robert Earnshaw prevented Germany from enduring a more uncomfortable finale and Wales also had legitimate claims for a penalty when Serdar Tasci handled to deny Joe Ledley the chance to bear down on the visitors' goal in the 27th minute. Referee Terje Hague waved away the appeals. Toshack was upset and also bemoaned Hague's decision in the lead-up to Ballack's piledriver when he claimed that Aaron Ramsey was caught out of position because of a throw-in that should have gone to Wales. Toshack, whose plans were earlier derailed when Craig Bellamy pulled out with a knee injury and Jason Koumas withdrew with a hip problem, said: \"It's a ridiculous mistake by the officials. It was a throw-in for Wales. Aaron Ramsey was making his way over and then the ball goes to Ballack in the area where he would have been. We also should have had a penalty kick. It's a clear handball and sending off. It's tough enough against one of the best sides in the world, without those decisions going against us.\" For all that, Germany were largely in control and Wales contributed to their own downfall. There appeared no danger when James Collins chased Mario G\u00f3mez towards the byline but the central defender was bundled off the ball before Williams, clearly unaware there was no opposition player in sight, turned the striker's cross into his own net."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
