Platini\u2018s lawyer, William Bourdon, said his client was innocent and that he had been questioned on \u201ctechnical grounds.\u201d \u201cIt was very long, given the number of questions, it was obviously always going to be long, since they asked me questions over Euro 2016, the World Cup in Russia, the World Cup in Qatar, Paris Saint Germain, Fifa,\u201d Platini told reporters on Wednesday as he left the police station where he had been detained. \u201cI arrived and was immediately taken into custody. It hurts. It hurts for everything I can think of, everything I\u2019ve done. It hurts, it hurts. \u201cBut after all, they did their job and then we tried to answer all the questions. I replied to all the questions calmly, whilst still not knowing why I was there. It was long, but given the number of questions it could not be different,\u201d Platini said, adding that he felt \u201cat peace.\u201d \u201cI feel totally foreign to any of these matters. This is an old affair, you know it, we explained it. I have always expressed myself with full transparency in all the newspapers. That\u2019s it, it goes on, they investigate, they search.\u201d Also detained for questioning and later released was Sophie Dion, a sports adviser in the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s administration. Claude Gueant, the former secretary general of the Elys\u00e9e presidential palace under Sarkozy, was questioned as a free witness and not detained. The decision in December 2010 to award the World Cup to Qatar surprised many given the lack of potential local audiences for the games, the extremely hot summer weather, and the poor performance of the country\u2019s national team. But the gas-rich nation is pouring billions into the world\u2019s most popular sport and has the means to finance new stadiums. It will be the first Arab state to host the competition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
