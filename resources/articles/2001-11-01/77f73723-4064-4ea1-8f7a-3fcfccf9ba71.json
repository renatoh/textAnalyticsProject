Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, is under fire in Brussels and Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, is much misunderstood in Rome. Mr Berlusconi came to the rescue of his former political rival in an interview published on Tuesday in which he claimed that Italy was the victim of an unjust hate campaign. There was, he said, something rotten in Brussels, as in Hamlet's Denmark of yore. Economic and political lobbies were trying to make Italy and its ruling class the scapegoat for things that were not working in Europe, Mr Berlusconi told the Milan daily Il Foglio. Criticisms were intended to downgrade a country seen as \"too strong to be excluded from really important decisions but sufficiently fragile to accept obvious lesions to its prestige without reacting.\" Il Foglio cited recent attacks on Mr Prodi in the German press, which had criticised his imperfect mastery of foreign languages and his strategic vision. Mr Berlusconi himself has also been the butt of European media criticism and has now decided to cry foul. Snubbed by other world leaders, vilified by the press - to which he now refuses to speak - and the victim of an anti-Italian lobby: it's simply not fair. Even the Corriere della Sera has noticed this sad state of affairs, commenting recently: \"It's unpleasant to point out, but it seems that Berlusconi is becoming, for a portion of European public opinion, a little Milosevic to be kept under constant democratic vigilance.\" The Rome daily La Repubblica, notoriously hostile to Mr Berlusconi, has been less sympathetic, warning that his unexpected embrace of the flailing Mr Prodi may simply hasten his drowning. Curzio Maltese advised the prime minister to limit the number of plots directed against him to avoid appearing paranoid. \"In Italy, where playing the victim is an art, we need a law that sets a limit,\" Mr Maltese wrote. \"Everyone should have the right to three, five, 10 plots on the part of whoever they choose (magistrates, journalists, communists, Islamists, Israeli secret services, Spectre, Joker, Spiderman etc.) Beyond that a statute of limitations should come into play. At least that, given that a sense of decency or of the ridiculous hasn't been in evidence for centuries.\" But if Mr Berlusconi has failed to cut a dash on the international stage since taking office four months ago, it may not be entirely the fault of a prejudiced press. Belgium's foreign minister gave him nought out of 10 for his performance, the same mark as for the Taliban, after his public gaffe about western cultural superiority over Islam. And his government's record at home has not exactly added lustre to his image. A law making international judicial cooperation more difficult, which critics say was intended to assure the prime minister's acquittal over embarrassing charges of corrupting Rome magistrates, is beginning to have practical effects. Lawyers representing Mafia bosses and the country's top international cigarette smuggler have announced they will invoke the new law to have evidence struck out that was acquired from abroad under the old rules. This week the widely respected head of the national anti-racket organisation, which encourages businessmen to denounce Mafia demands for protection money and compensates them in the event of financial losses, resigned from his post. Tano Grasso was indignant at being flanked in his work by a police officer appointed by the new government. \"The appointment of a new commissioner has seriously undermined my role in an activity that does not permit the slightest weakening, because the lives and hopes of the victims of extortion and usury are at stake,\" Mr Grasso wrote in his letter of resignation. Charismatic leaders of the anti-Mafia struggle were kept waiting all day by the interior minister when they gathered in Rome last week to express solidarity with Mr Grasso. His departure is almost universally seen as a serious setback for the war on crime. On the international front, the government's handling of its controversial decision to pull out of the project for a European military transport plane, the Airbus A400M, has been a public relations disaster. The first indication of the government's intention came when the European affairs minister used it to explain the fact that Mr Berlusconi had not been invited to a mini-summit in Gand by his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany. The other leaders would be discussing the military Airbus, which was a waste of money, and Italy would not be there because it wasn't participating in the project, the minister said. The decision to cancel Italy's order for 16 of the new aircraft was confirmed by the defence minister last week. He told a popular television talkshow that the Italian military didn't need them and the government was not prepared to spend a \u00a31bn just to wave the flag for Europe and subsidise European aerospace companies. Mr Berlusconi himself finally told parliament that no decision had been reached, while confirming the opinion that the plane was surplus to Air Force requirements. Whatever decision is finally announced on November 8 the government will get few marks for presentation. The debacle even prompted an intervention by the president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who reiterated Italy's commitment to European integration and a common defence policy. \"I can't accept the questioning of Italy's Europeanism,\" Mr Ciampi said during a visit to Tunisia. \"Italy's option in favour of a European defence is fundamental and it has already been taken.\" Mr Ciampi's words were delivered with uncharacteristic irritation. It was not clear whether they amounted to a resounding defence of Mr Berlusconi's government or a warning. The fact that he was induced to pronounce them was an indication of unusual disarray in Italy's foreign policy, an unchanging plank that has now been called into question."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
