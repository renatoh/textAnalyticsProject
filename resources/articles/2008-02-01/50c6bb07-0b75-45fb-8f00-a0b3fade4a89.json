Rice said that Russia had worked well with the US on North Korea, Iran, the Middle East and terrorism, but that \"this kind of rhetoric\" arose over the structure of Europe after the cold war. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said yesterday that he would have no choice but to target Kiev if an American missile shield was deployed in Ukraine. The most senior Republican on the Senate committee, Richard Lugar, asked Rice why Putin had been invited to attend a Nato summit in Bucharest in April, as his presence could \"intimidate\" some members of the alliance. \"Nato will do what it must as an alliance, and Russia has no veto,\" Rice responded, adding that the US is \"absolutely devoted\" to maintaining the independence of Ukraine and other eastern European countries. \"The Soviet Union had all these parts, but that was another point in time, and it is gone forever, and I hope that Russia understands that,\" she said. She also said that the summit would be a chance to show \"that Nato is a strong and unified alliance that is not going to see a return to the cold war, and that means neither to Russia's ability to intimidate neighbours, nor to the times when we had an implacably hostile relationship with the Soviet Union\". Invitations for Albania, Croatia and Macedonia to join the alliance will be considered at the summit. Rice said that \"should [those countries] meet the standard, it is our view that they ought to be invited for membership\", but that the US would reserve final judgment until it consulted with allies. She gave a similar answer to a question on whether Ukraine and Georgia should be offered a spot in Nato's \"membership action plan\". She said the two countries should receive that status \"as they become able and capable of carrying out the responsibilities that go with them\". Rice also said that she hoped Serbians would accept a resolution of Kosovo's status and move forward. Answering other questions, Rice said that next week's elections in Pakistan must inspire confidence that the country's citizens can vote freely, and that she hoped a new government there would include \"moderate voices\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
