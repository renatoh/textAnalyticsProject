It is running a leading article in its Tuesday issue calling on Britons to vote to leave the EU in Thursday\u2019s referendum. In so doing, it is supporting its columnist Boris Johnson, one of the leaders of the campaign urging Britain to quit. It is also in line with the sympathies of its readers. Two weeks ago, a poll of its own subscribers found that 69% said they were planning to vote for Brexit. The Telegraph\u2019s stance aligns it with other papers that have declared for the leave campaign: its stablemate, the Sunday Telegraph plus the Sun, the Sunday Times and the Sunday Express. Papers that have announced support for remain include the Guardian, the Observer, the Times, the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Mirror. The Telegraph\u2019s 2,000-word long editorial accuses \u201cthe Remainers\u201d of trying to scare the public \u201cinto believing that calamity lies in wait for an independent Britain\u201d. It argues that \u201ca world of opportunity is waiting for a fully independent Britain\u201d, not least because it is \u201ca leading economic power\u201d. Contending that \u201cacross Europe, disenchantment with Brussels is growing\u201d, the paper says: \u201cThose who dismiss the referendum here as some British eccentricity whipped up by Little Englander Europhobes need to ask why the EU is so unpopular elsewhere. \u201cThe principal reason is its anti-democratic nature \u2013 the dislocation between those who govern and the governed \u2026 The fact that the EU is a collection of democracies does not detract from the reality that this is a profoundly undemocratic institution.\u201d The Telegraph also attacks the prime minister, David Cameron, registering its dismay \u201cwith the way his campaign has been conducted, especially in besmirching his opponents and impugning their motives\u201d. It concludes: \u201cWe are told it is a choice between fear and hope. If that is the case, then we choose hope \u2026 On Thursday, the country has another opportunity to lift the clouds. We must take it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
