Or, as a graffitist wrote on Rachel Whiteread's demolished architectural artwork, House: \"Wot for?\" Artists such as Salcedo and Whiteread reproduce not just the scale and drama of architecture, but its language. That is, their materials are not just concrete and metal pins, but the basic assumptions with which architects work. If architects create buildings, these artists create \"unbuildings\". Even the most modern of buildings - even Tate Modern - is supposed to stay upright, stable and keep the rain off people's heads. It isn't supposed to open like the Red Sea and let minds, if not bodies, fall into the void - that's the architect's worst nightmare. Worse than a wobbly bridge. In coming into a building with diggers and cement but with no interest at all in building anything useful, an artist such as Salcedo can turn architecture upside down - or, as cultural theorists who have read Sigmund Freud's 1919 essay The Uncanny prefer to say, can reveal the architectural uncanny. This isn't an entirely pretentious quotation. The German word for uncanny is unheimlich, which literally means unhomely. German recognises that nothing is spookier or more unsettling than feeling ill at ease in your own home; feeling that the architecture of everyday life has somehow turned exquisitely and unfathomably awry. In 1858, in a speech that warned of imminent civil war between the anti-slavery northern and slave-owning southern states of the US, presidential hopeful Abraham Lincoln drew on the Bible to warn: \"A house divided against itself will not stand.\" For Lincoln, the house whose terrible fissure will cause it to collapse unless something is quickly done is not just a psychological but a political metaphor. And that is how Salcedo means it, too. Colombia in the 1980s, when Salcedo began making art, was as divided and violent as the 19th-century North America of Poe and Lincoln. Born in Bogot\u00e1 in 1958, Salcedo insists her work is a direct expression of other people's suffering, rather than merely her own emotional response to it; indeed, that each work of art she makes is based on specific first-hand accounts from victims of violence and forced migration. It was specifically in trying to document and commemorate Colombian victims that she got interested in making holes and voids in buildings - voids whose significance isn't hard to decode. Salcedo was in her 30s when her art really started to take shape. In 1985 she witnessed a horrific clash between guerrillas and the state that ended in people being burned to death in the occupied Palace of Justice in Bogot\u00e1: \"It left its mark on me. I began to conceive of works based on nothing.\" Her response was to go to a hospital in Bogot\u00e1 and collect dead patients' discarded shoes, which she put into cavities dug in a wall and veiled in a weblike fibre. She has admitted that it is hard to learn and develop when you come from a place that, before the internet, seemed cut off from the rest of the world: \"In a third-world country, one suffers from a lack of information.\" Later, she studied in New York, where she became interested in the art of Joseph Beuys, before returning to Colombia to teach. She is still based in Bogot\u00e1 but travels widely as an artist - an important recent work was made for the Istanbul Biennial. She says her Tate Modern piece has to do with the experience of a migrant from a poor country in a rich western capital. In fact, it may come as a surprise, seeing how powerfully she occupies Tate's converted power station, that until quite recently Salcedo has been best known for domestic works on an intimate scale. Even her grandiose recent installations use old wooden chairs. The unhomely begins at home, and Salcedo's most characteristic sculptures take timeworn wooden furniture - a wardrobe, a kitchen table - and turn them into eerie ghosts of themselves. There is a violence to her home invasions. An old cupboard with drawers, the kind of quaint furniture item around which Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez might weave a magical fiction, is filled with cold, hard concrete in a piece she made in 1995: the private world of dreams and memories, of the bedroom, is occupied by the steel and cement of a chilly authoritarian public life. Pieces such as this are, according to Salcedo, not her own imaginings, but reportage: \"Each of the pieces tells its own story, articulated by images relating to real events. They rely heavily on the words the victim used while telling his or her experiences.\" It might seem that Salcedo is a somewhat invisible and distant presence behind her impressive work - and that's how she wants it: the voices she is trying to give form to are those of the powerless. Or rather, she can't give them form: instead she takes form away. To give form is an act of power. There is no art more involved with power than architecture because nothing says as clearly as a building that \"I had the power to build this\". Surely it's no coincidence that women such as Salcedo and Whiteread take on the heavy-duty materials and the power-bragging aesthetic of architecture and turn it inside out. If to give form to bricks and stone and steel - to erect a skyscraper or power station - is an act of power, then to make a crack in a building might be to release the voices, to glimpse the suffering of the oppressed. Sound corny? Well, it is an idea that has given Tate Modern by far the most haunting of its Turbine Hall installations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
