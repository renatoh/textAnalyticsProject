Landing on Water (1986) If other 1970s greats, including Don Henley, were having 80s hits with modern, synth-heavy records then why shouldn\u2019t Neil Young give it a go? A question to which the obvious answer is: because it might sound like Landing on Water, on which perfectly good songs \u2013 not least Hippie Dream\u2019s devastating portrait of David Crosby in his coked-out ruin \u2013 were knackered by sterile, unsympathetic production. 44. Everybody\u2019s Rockin\u2019 (1983) As a monumental middle-finger to a record label that had demanded a \u201crock\u201d album from Young, the rockabilly and 50s R&amp;B of Everybody\u2019s Rockin\u2019 is pretty impressive. As a listening experience, not so much. The digital production is horrible; the cover of Jimmy Reed\u2019s Bright Lights Big City abysmal. 43. Old Ways (1985) It has its moments, My Boy and Are There Any More Real Cowboys? among them, but Young\u2019s 80s country record \u2013 produced again, it seemed, mainly to annoy his then-label, Geffen \u2013 is overproduced, syrupy and cliched to the point of sounding patronising. His subsequent courting of the conservative Nashville market by making reactionary statements in interviews is best overlooked. 42. Are You Passionate? (2002) This collaboration with Booker T and the MGs, which attracted much attention for the bellicose, post-9/11-themed Let\u2019s Roll, is otherwise forgettable: competent, aimless mid-tempo songs; low on thrills. Relief arrives when Crazy Horse lumber gracelessly into view on Goin\u2019 Home. 41. Peace Trail (2016) You cannot fault Young\u2019s recent work ethic, or his political commitment, but Peace Trail \u2013 his second album of 2016, partly inspired by the environmental protests at Standing Rock reservation \u2013 was a mess: sketchy songwriting, half-baked musical ideas including a burst of Auto-Tuned vocals, platitudinous lyrics. Good title track, though. 40. Life (1987) After hobbling Landing on Water with a cack-handed application of synths and drum machines, Young proceeded to hobble an album with his old muckers Crazy Horse in exactly the same way. It\u2019s infuriating as the songs were often great, as evidenced by Prisoners of Rock and Roll, a virtual manifesto for Crazy Horse\u2019s primitive musical approach: \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna be good.\u201d 39. Fork in the Road (2009) \u201cI\u2019m a big rock star, my sales have tanked / But I still got you \u2013 thanks,\u201d offered Young on the title track. He\u2019s nothing if not honest, but his sales might have held up better had his later albums not sounded increasingly dashed-off, with more thought put into their messages \u2013 here about pollution and the ongoing financial crisis \u2013 than the music. 38. Broken Arrow (1996) There is a pervasive theory that Young\u2019s music has suffered since the death of his long-term producer, David Briggs, the one man who seemed capable of reining him in and calling out his less inspired ideas. Certainly the first album he made after Briggs\u2019s death felt sprawling and directionless: long Crazy Horse jams alongside bootleg-quality live tracks. 37. Paradox (2018) Darryl Hannah\u2019s incoherent film about Young and his latest young collaborators, Promise of the Real, is an endurance test to rival 1972\u2019s similarly aimless documentary Journey Through the Past, but the soundtrack \u2013 a patchwork of instrumental passages, outtakes and live recordings \u2013 is quite immersive and enjoyable as it drifts along, although clearly only diehard Young nuts need apply. 36. Colorado (2019) The latest in a succession of middling albums with Crazy Horse, Colorado features some incendiary performances in the band\u2019s patent ham-fisted style \u2013 there\u2019s a moment midway through She Showed Me Love where drummer Ralph Molina appears to stop playing by mistake \u2013 but it also features some painfully on-the-nose political lyrics, and not much in the way of decent tunes. 35. Storytone (2014) Indecision plagued Storytone, which Young released in three versions: one orchestrated, one stripped back, one with a bit of both. Perhaps he realised that the album\u2019s initial Neil Young-as-crooner concept didn\u2019t quite work, veering as it did between charming (the big band-fuelled I Want to Drive My Car) and schlocky (Tumbleweed). 34. Prairie Wind (2005) The least appealing of Young\u2019s albums in the Harvest vein, Prairie Wind is still one of Young\u2019s stronger latter-day albums. The autumnal, reflective mood of He Was the King and This Old Guitar were presumably influenced by the death of his father and Young\u2019s own brush with mortality after a brain aneurysm. 33. Silver &amp; Gold (2000) Another album in the country-rock vein of Harvest. The highlights are high \u2013 the brooding closer Without Rings is particularly fine \u2013 but there is a lot of filler, and the rose-tinted nostalgia of Young\u2019s paean to his former band, Buffalo Springfield Again, is particularly runny. 32. Greendale (2003) Hailed by some as a return to form \u2013 which simply meant an improvement on its lacklustre predecessor, Are You Passionate? \u2013 Greendale was Young\u2019s rock opera, a grandiose title that seemed antithetical to its rough, bluesy sound. The songwriting is too uneven to sustain interest: Be the Rain and Bandit are great; Grandpa\u2019s Interview interminable. 31. Arc (1991) It was Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore who suggested Young release a live album entirely comprised of the feedback-laden intros and outros of his live performances. Mixed in the studio into one 35-minute track, it is not quite as confrontational a statement as Lou Reed\u2019s Metal Machine Music, but it\u2019s worth hearing at least once. 30. The Monsanto Years (2015) Young\u2019s latest backing band, Promise of the Real, sound fiery here, and Young himself is audibly livid, but The Monsanto Years was another album that felt rushed to the point that actual writing had been overlooked. The lyrics \u2013 raining fire on GMOs \u2013 frequently feel more like ranting blogposts set to music than songs. 29. Trans (1982) Inspired by his quadriplegic son Ben, an electronic Neil Young concept album with vocodered vocals was an incredibly bold move, so much so that Young padded it out with more straightforward material. The end result was a curious mess; the loveliness of Transformer Man was fully revealed only when Young played it acoustically on 1993\u2019s MTV Unplugged. 28. Hawks &amp; Doves (1980) Distracted by family strife, Young\u2019s follow-up to the classic Rust Never Sleeps was a ragged collection of thrown-together country tunes and sundry offcuts. Hawks &amp; Doves is wildly uneven, its title track flatly awful, but the good bits \u2013 the sinister Captain Kennedy, the beautiful Lost in Space, The Old Homestead\u2019s lengthy allegory for his own career \u2013 are fantastic. 27. Mirror Ball (1995) Clearly proud of his \u201cgodfather of grunge\u201d tag \u2013 Crazy Horse\u2019s combination of looseness and intensity was a key influence on the sound \u2013 Mirror Ball saw Young collaborating with Pearl Jam. The results were solid, but never explosive or edgy enough to stop you wishing he\u2019d chosen to work with his former tourmates Sonic Youth, who might have pushed him harder. 26. Chrome Dreams II (2007) Classic Neil: 30 years after declining to release an album called Chrome Dreams, he puts out a follow-up. Chrome Dreams II hinges on one track, the astonishing 18-minute Ordinary People. Recorded in 1987, it casts most of the album\u2019s newer material in an unforgiving light, but the frazzled, ultra-distorted Dirty Old Man holds its own. 25. Americana (2012) An album largely comprised of folksongs dramatically reassembled \u2013 Clementine and Oh Susanna among them \u2013 Americana is sporadically great, occasionally sloppy and sometimes genuinely surprising. Improbably enough, it concludes with Crazy Horse setting about God Save the Queen, as in the UK national anthem, not the Sex Pistols song. 24. Neil Young (1968) \u201cOverdub city,\u201d protested Young of his solo debut, and he had a point. It is packed with fantastic songs that Young would repeatedly return to live \u2013 The Loner, Here We Are in the Years, The Old Laughing Lady \u2013 but frequently groans under the weight of Jack Nitzsche\u2019s elaborate arrangements. From this point on, Young would prize simplicity and spontaneity. 23. Psychedelic Pill (2012) Crazy Horse made their name playing extended jams, an approach Psychedelic Pill took to the extreme: the opener here, Driftin\u2019 Back, goes on for the best part of half an hour. Whether it warrants that length is another question, although Ramada Inn, which clocks in at a mere 16 minutes, is terrific. 22. Dead Man (1995) Young\u2019s first film soundtrack, 1972\u2019s Journey Through the Past, was a mishmash of live recordings and outtakes that succeeded in horrifying fans who thought it was the follow-up to Harvest. Performed live to a rough cut of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s surreal western Dead Man, it is something else: a lengthy, stark, occasionally violent guitar instrumental. 21. American Stars \u2019N Bars (1977) The weakest of Young\u2019s 1970s studio albums, American Stars \u2019N Bars matched tracks taken from the then-unreleased Homegrown with lo-fi home recordings (the oddly creepy Will to Love), leaden country-rock and one undisputed Crazy Horse classic: Like a Hurricane (although there are better live versions out there). 20. A Letter Home (2014) It sounds like a novelty \u2013 Young recording cover versions in a 1947 vinyl recording booth owned by Jack White \u2013 but A Letter Home works, leaping from songs Young would have played as a coffeehouse folk singer, such as Bert Jansch\u2019s Needle of Death, to a haunting version of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s My Hometown. 19. Living With War (2006) Swiftly recorded and released, backed by a 100-voice choir, the anti-Iraq war tirade Living With War finds Young sounding energised by the urgency of his undertaking and, one suspects, by the furore he must have known it would cause. A subsequent Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young tour heavy on this material was greeted by boos and walkouts from their more conservative fans. 18. Re-ac-tor (1981) A Crazy Horse album that\u2019s grinding, dark and repetitious (deliberately so; it\u2019s influenced by a gruelling programme of treatment undergone by Young\u2019s son), Re-ac-tor is hard work, occasionally uninspired and sometimes magnificent, as on the ferocious din of Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze and the concluding Shots. 17. Harvest (1972) That Harvest\u2019s huge commercial success sparked a bout of wilful, even contrarian behaviour in Young wasn\u2019t so inexplicable: he presumably knew his biggest album was nowhere near his best. The songs veer from fantastic (the title track; Words) to forgettable, while the arrangements are slick but sometimes overblown, as on A Man Needs a Maid. 16. This Note\u2019s for You (1988) By far the most successful of Young\u2019s 80s genre experiments, and a creative rebirth of sorts, Young\u2019s bluesy R&amp;B album is best known for its title track, an evisceration of 80s rock\u2019s growing penchant for corporate sponsorship, but its best moments are subtle and understated: the atmospheric Twilight, the small-hours melancholy of Coupe De Ville. 15. Hitchhiker (1976) The sound of Young alone in the studio, \u201cturning on the tap\u201d as David Briggs put it, and letting new songs pour out (almost all of which ended up being re-recorded elsewhere). The fact that Young is audibly, heroically stoned throughout only adds to the album\u2019s intimate charm. 14. Le Noise (2010) Produced by Daniel Lanois, this is Young\u2019s best album of the 21st century, and it took him somewhere new. Lanois added the occasional disorientating tape loop while Young accompanies himself on distorted electric guitar, which he is clearly playing at ear-splitting volume. Bringing this freshness of approach to a solo singer-songwriter album resulted in some strong material. 13. Harvest Moon (1992) Harvest Moon is better than the classic album its title referenced, and whose backing musicians it reassembled. The sound fits the songs, which are wistful and streaked with nostalgia. The title track, its riff nicked from the Everly Brothers\u2019 Walk Right Back, is a genuinely beautiful hymn to marriage and enduring love. 12. Ragged Glory (1991) Crazy Horse at their most gleefully primitive \u2013 Young apparently recorded his vocals standing in a pile of horse manure \u2013 rampaging through garage-rock standards (the Premiers\u2019 Farmer John), riotous jams (Love and Only Love, Mansion on the Hill) and paeans to their own limitations (F!#*in\u2019 Up). A blast from start to finish. 11. Homegrown (1975) \u201cSometimes life hurts,\u201d wrote Young in explanation of Homegrown\u2019s belated 2020 release, 45 years after he recorded it in the wake of his split from the actor Carrie Snodgrass. It\u2019s certainly downcast, its tone set by the opener Separate Ways, but it is also Young at the peak of his powers, writing fragile, beautiful songs. 10. Comes a Time (1978) The gentle country-rock album his record company doubtless wished he had released as a follow-up to Harvest, Comes a Time is far better than its spiritual predecessor. It is rougher round the edges \u2013 Crazy Horse show up on the wonderful Lotta Love and Look Out for My Love \u2013 and home to a brace of Young classics, the title track among them. 9. Freedom (1989) After a confused 1980s, Young\u2019s stunning return to full, raging power was perfectly timed, chiming with the nascent grunge movement he helped inspire. The widely misinterpreted Rockin\u2019 in the Free World was the hit, but Freedom is packed with killer tracks, from the lengthy, horn-backed Crime in the City (Sixty to Zero) to a ferocious, feedback-strafed cover of On Broadway. 8. Sleeps With Angels (1994) Kurt Cobain\u2019s suicide note quoted a Young lyric, much to its author\u2019s horror; the title track of Sleeps With Angels was his distressed response. Elsewhere, this is as bleakly compelling and creepy as his mid-70s work, with Crazy Horse on surprisingly muted form. Piece of Crap, meanwhile, introduces Young the cranky middle-aged refusenik, a role he would frequently inhabit. 7. Time Fades Away (1973) Only Neil Young would follow up his commercial breakthrough with a chaotic audio-verit\u00e9 souvenir of a disastrous tour. But Time Fades Away isn\u2019t just a screw-you gesture, it\u2019s utterly compelling. The songs \u2013 Last Dance\u2019s churning, hippy-baiting din; fragile piano ballad The Bridge; and the autobiographical Don\u2019t Be Denied \u2013 are incredible, potentiated by the ragged performances. 6. Zuma (1975) Lighter in tone than the \u201cditch trilogy\u201d (Time Fades Away, Tonight\u2019s the Night and On the Beach) that preceded it, Zuma reunited Young with a revitalised Crazy Horse, sparking Barstool Blues\u2019s glorious evocation of a drunk mind meandering and the brooding, majestic historical epic Cortez the Killer. And its lambent closer Through My Sails is the last truly great song that Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young released. 5. After the Gold Rush (1970) After The Gold Rush feels like Young\u2019s morning-after-the-60s album, but unlike the consoling tone of Simon &amp; Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge Over Troubled Water, it is gaunt, troubled and affecting. Amid the relationship woes, there is ecological disaster, racism and Don\u2019t Let It Bring You Down, which, Young noted, was \u201cguaranteed to bring you down\u201d. 4. On the Beach (1974) Despairing and disconsolate, but set to beautiful music: the shimmering electric piano of See the Sky About to Rain, the epic acoustic closer Ambulance Blues (\u201cYou\u2019re all just pissing in the wind,\u201d it concludes), the title track\u2019s stoned, misty take on rock. For contrast, there is Revolution Blues, a ferocious, unsparing portrait of Young\u2019s old acquaintance Charles Manson. 3. Tonight\u2019s the Night (1975) Young\u2019s tequila-sodden, no-filter response to the deaths of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and their roadie Bruce Berry is harrowing, extraordinarily powerful listening, the drunken raucousness of the performances matching the raw emotion of the songs. The point when Young\u2019s voice cracks during Mellow My Mind is perhaps the most starkly potent in his catalogue. 2. Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969) Young\u2019s debut with Crazy Horse is an incredible album: the sheer potency of its songs and sound; the killer riff of Cinnamon Girl; the way the playing on the extended jams Down By the River and Cowgirl in the Sand embodies their lyrical angst, keeping the listener utterly gripped even as they tip the 10-minute mark. 1. Rust Never Sleeps (1979) The line between Young\u2019s live and studio albums has always been flexible. Rust Never Sleeps was recorded on stage in 1978, then overdubbed. In truth, most of his 70s albums could conceivably be called his best \u2013 he kept up a remarkably high standard \u2013 but Rust Never Sleeps offers a perfect summary of everything that makes him great, its quality perhaps spurred by the punk movement he references on Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) and, more elliptically, on Thrasher. Side one\u2019s sequence of acoustic songs is breathtaking, and Crazy Horse rage in thunderous style on side two, home to Powderfinger\u2019s heartbreaking saga of violence, death and familial bonds \u2013 arguably his greatest song."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
