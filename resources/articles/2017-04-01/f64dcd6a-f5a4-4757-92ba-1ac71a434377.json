The prisons minister, Sam Gyimah, said stamping out the scourge would help transform prisons into \u201cplaces of safety and reform\u201d and vowed to lock up those responsible for flying the devices. The move comes after jails recorded a steep increase in drone drop-offs, with figures revealing there were 33 incidents of drones being detected over prisons in England and Wales in 2015. That was a rise from just two in 2014 and none at all in 2013 and reflects the falling prices and greater capabilities of the devices. In November, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said there had been a big increase in the number of reported drone incidents over the past year. The specialist hit squad will include prison and police officers, law enforcement agencies, and members of the prison and probation services. Members of the team will inspect recovered drones in an effort to identify and track down the individuals involved in orchestrating the airborne smuggling runs. Gyimah said: \u201cMy message to those who involve themselves in this type of criminal activity is clear: we will find you and put you behind bars.\u201d The crackdown aims to help disrupt the flow of drugs and mobile phones into prisons as the government attempts to tackle increasing levels of violence and self-harm in prisons. Drones are increasingly becoming a headache for the police, with the number of reported drone-related incidents in the UK having increased more than twelvefold over the past two years. The number of complaints, including allegations of snooping, burglary \u201cscoping\u201d exercises, and mid-air near-misses with aircraft rose to almost 3,500 last year, or about 10 a day. Last year\u2019s figure was almost three times higher than the 2015 total of 1,237 incidents. The true total is likely to be even higher as the data, which was obtained by the Press Association through freedom of information requests, was not available for all UK police forces. Drones, collectively known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can be bought for as as little as \u00a330. The devices, which often contain built-in cameras, have become a common sight in recent years but as their popularity has increased so have concerns about their use. According to the MoJ, the setting up of the specialist unit comes after the longest sentence for delivering contraband into prisons via drone was handed down. A joint operation by police and prison officers led to the arrest of Remo White-Channer and Romaine Gayle on 31 March. The pair were jailed for six years and six months, and four years and four months respectively, for attempting to flood prisons across Hertfordshire, Suffolk and Kent with contraband worth around \u00a348,000. As part of a crime group they used drones in an effort to fly packages of cannabis, spice and heroin, as well as mobile phones into three different prisons. The MoJ said the strict sentences sent a clear message that those found flying drones into prisons would face significant time behind bars. Further examples provided by the MoJ include: \u2022 In December, Dean Rawley-Bell, 21, was jailed for four years and eight months after he used a drone in attempts to smuggle drugs and mobile phones into HMP Manchester. \u2022 In October, Renelle Carlisle, 23, was jailed for three years and four months after he was caught outside HMP Risley in Warrington with a drone in his bag, trying to smuggle drugs into the prison. \u2022 In July, 37-year-old Daniel Kelly was sentenced to 14 months in prison, for attempting to supply offenders at HMP Elmley and Swaleside in Sheppey, HMP Wandsworth in London and HMP The Mount in Hemel Hempstead with contraband."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
