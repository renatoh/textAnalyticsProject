(The private schools have already been out for a week.) Like daylight saving, this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm, and children were required to work in the fields for two months. In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp, the cheapest of which \u2013 not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed \u2013 are about $500 (\u00a3395) per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial 3pm. The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year. The childcare hustle is so costly and extreme that if you\u2019re not careful, it can blow through the main advantage of summer: an invitation to spend more time with your children. Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids than they used to. According to analysis from the Pew Research Center, in 1965 mothers in the US spent on average 10 hours a week caring for their kids compared with 14 hours now. (For fathers, those figures are two and a half hours in 1965 and eight hours now.) But my instinct is that, of those 14 hours, a large proportion is spent fretting about where to put the kids the rest of the time, how much it\u2019s going to cost, and whether they are being sufficiently improved by the activities they\u2019re doing. My children start kindergarten in the autumn, and their new school has issued parents with a stern warning about \u201csummer slide\u201d, which over 10 weeks of non-attendance is, I\u2019m sure, is considerable. Advising parents to ensure their kids carry on reading every day is sensible, but it does add to the sense of the summer break as a terrible obstacle to overcome rather than an annual release from pressure. I don\u2019t want to get too Swallows and Amazons about this, but the dedication of summer to worthwhile pursuit seems to undermine its very reason for being. It also feels like a particularly noticeable glitch in modern parenting psychology. I sometimes catch myself complaining about how many extra hours I will have to take off over the next 10 weeks, what a monstrous hassle and expense it all is, why the city is set up to punish working parents \u2013 on and on I go before stopping short, and telling myself to shut up. This is an insane way to live and it crushes the joy out of everything. No one I know can take two months off work, and most of us wouldn\u2019t want to: but in spite of the difficulties there has to be a way to regard the summer as a bonus, not a chore; to approach the shortfall in childcare as a gift, not a source of guilt. After all, based on what many of us know from our own childhoods, it\u2019s unstructured time, not the feverish schlep between camp and classes and play dates, that really helps child development. For the love of God, for a second let\u2019s take our eyes off the meter. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
