Lawyers representing a new independent body, the Offside Trust, that has been set up to help the victims and their families described it as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d that, only three days after its formation, there had already been numerous first-hand accounts from former and current professional footballers directly implicating people who were still involved in the game and \u201cneed further investigation\u201d. Other victims have informed the trust they were offered large sums of money as long as they signed confidentiality agreements to prevent the clubs suffering damaging publicity, in the same way that Chelsea paid \u00a350,000 to their former player Gary Johnson in an attempt to stifle the allegations against Eddie Heath, a scout for the London club in the 1970s. Chelsea issued an apology over the weekend but Ed Smethurst, representing Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, the two players whose interviews in the Guardian opened what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis he has ever known within the sport, said there was already clear information that other clubs had been part of similar cover-ups. Asked how many clubs he was referring to, he said it was \u201cless than five\u201d but also reiterated that the trust had been operating only since Friday. \u201cIt is unfurling as we speak,\u201d he said. Smethurst went on to say there were grave misgivings about the FA\u2019s independent inquiry, pointing out that \u201ca lot of people have come forward who have said they don\u2019t have trust the establishment\u201d, but his most alarming revelation was that some of the people identified as offenders were still working within the sport. \u201cThere are certain names who do come up repeatedly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to divulge specifics but there are absolutely people in the game today who victims have spoken to me about. There are specific allegations against specific individuals, many of whom have been rumoured to be involved for a very long period of time, some of whom still work in the senior echelons of football, and it\u2019s extremely worrying.\u201d Smethurst described it as a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of calls since Woodward spoke to this newspaper and was asked about the fact that some of the coaches who had previously been under suspicion were still working in football. \u201cIs it a surprise? No. There are other individuals in the game, past and present, where further action could, and should, have been taken,\u201d he said. The latest police figures, issued last Thursday, stated that around 350 alleged victims had made official complaints. Those involved 55 clubs, at professional and amateur level, but the players who have driven the campaign are aware of many others with similar stories who do not want to go public. \u201cI\u2019ve had about 50 different ex-players who have contacted me to say things have happened to them,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAndy has had a similar number of calls. Some have told me they\u2019ve been groomed, others had a certain level of abuse, some are horrific stories. It\u2019s never-ending. I had one call on the way here today. There are so many more. I\u2019m getting phone calls every day. You wont believe how many are still to come out.\u201d Walters, sitting next to Woodward at an emotional press conference to launch the trust, added: \u201cFair play to Chelsea \u2013 it\u2019s too little, too late, but they have put their apology out there in a sincere manner. Other clubs, though, have got their heads in the sand. These children trusted them and the clubs have let everyone down.\u201d Two individuals who previously worked together at the same club have repeatedly been named \u2013 one no longer in employment \u2013 and Smethurst said some of the players making complaints felt unable to waive their anonymity. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve been a victim of something like this I think it\u2019s very difficult for an outsider to understand. Some want to talk about it, but don\u2019t necessarily want the furore. They might not want their parents or children to know, or they might think that there is nothing they can do about it, or that it might be swept under the carpet.\u201d The FA has appointed a QC, Kate Gallafent, to oversee its investigation but some of the victims have questioned whether it can truly be considered an independent inquiry if the governing body is paying the person investigating its own role. Smethurst, working on a pro bono basis for the trust as managing director of the Manchester firm Prosperity Law, made the same point and encouraged other players to come forward even if they had agreed payments from clubs to remain silent. \u201cCertainly, allegations have been made by victims that confidentiality clauses have been used in relation to other clubs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does happen. I can\u2019t speak about what Chelsea\u2019s lawyers advised them but, from a campaigning perspective, we think some things are so important \u2013 the protection of children for one \u2013 that clubs should not hush these things up and tie victims up in confidentiality. \u201cThere is a wider perspective here about the protection of the victim and stopping these things from reoccurring. It\u2019s often the case if there is an abuser that there are other people who know, or who have turned a blind eye, so I would say even if the person is dead I would not encourage the use of confidentiality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
