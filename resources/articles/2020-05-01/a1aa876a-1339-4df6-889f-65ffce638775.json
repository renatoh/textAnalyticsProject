ESPN aired the final episode of the wildly popular Michael Jordan documentary on Sunday but one of the NBA superstar\u2019s former teammates has already taken issue with the show. Horace Grant, who won three titles alongside Jordan with the Chicago Bulls, said the documentary was edited to make Jordan look better. Some critics have pointed out that the fact that The Last Dance was co-produced by one of Jordan\u2019s companies was glossed over. \u201cI would say [the documentary was] entertaining, but we know, who was there as teammates, that about 90% of it [was] BS in terms of the realness of it,\u201d Grant said in an interview on ESPN 1000\u2019s Kap and Co radio show on Tuesday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t real \u2013 because a lot of things [Jordan] said to some of his teammates, that his teammates went back at him. But all of that was kind of edited out of the documentary, if you want to call it a documentary.\u201d Jordan is depicted as a man ruthlessly devoted to winning in The Last Dance, even if it comes at the expense of his personal popularity. Grant, who was with the Bulls for seven years, said Jordan sometimes went too far. \u201cHe felt that he could dominate me, but that was sadly mistaken,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause whenever he went at me, I went at him right back. But in terms of Will Perdue, Steve Kerr and the young man, Scott Burrell, that was heartbreaking [to watch]. To see a guy, a leader, to go at those guys like that. I understand in terms of practicing, you have a push and shove here and there, but outright punching [teammates] and things of that nature. And calling them the B\u2019s and the H\u2019s, that wasn\u2019t called for.\u201d In The Last Dance, Jordan says he believes Grant, with whom he won three NBA titles at the Chicago Bulls, had been an inside source for The Jordan Rules, a book that sometimes painted the Hall of Famer in an unflattering light. \u201cLie, lie, lie. ... If MJ had a grudge with me, let\u2019s settle this like men,\u201d Grant said on Tuesday. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it. Or we can settle it another way. But yet and still, he goes out and puts this lie out that I was the source behind [The Jordan Rules]. Sam Smith [the author of the book] and I have always been great friends. We\u2019re still great friends. But the sanctity of that locker room, I would never put anything personal out there. The mere fact that Sam Smith was an investigative reporter. That he had to have two sources, two, to write a book, I guess. Why would MJ just point me out? \u201cIt\u2019s only a grudge, man. I\u2019m telling you, it was only a grudge. And I think he proved that during this so-called documentary. When if you say something about him, he\u2019s going to cut you off, he\u2019s going to try to destroy your character.\u201d Scottie Pippen, who was the second-best player on Jordan\u2019s great Bulls teams, is also said to have been unhappy with his portrayal in The Last Dance. Jordan called Pippen \u201cselfish\u201d in an early episode. \u201cI have never seen a quote unquote number two guy, as decorated as Scottie Pippen, portrayed so badly,\u201d Grant said. Grant said he had last communicated with Jordan three years ago when they texted each other about golf. He ended the interview by addressing the role of Jordan\u2019s company in the making of the documentary. \u201cWhen that so-called documentary is about one person, basically, and he has the last word on what\u2019s going to be put out there ... it\u2019s not a documentary,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt\u2019s his narrative of what happens in the last, quote-unquote dance. That\u2019s not a documentary because a whole bunch of things was cut out, edited out. So that\u2019s why I call it a so-called documentary.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
