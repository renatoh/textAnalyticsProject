The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, one of the organizations that awards Emmys, said Cuomo\u2019s award, the Founder\u2019s award, is \u201cin recognition of his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of television to inform and calm people around the world\u201d. Prior recipients of the award include Oprah Winfrey and the former US vice-president Al Gore. Cuomo said on Friday that the recognition is \u201cflattering\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s flattering for the people of [New York]\u201d. He joked that reporters at the press conference \u201chelped hone my presentation skills and acting skills\u201d. In the early months of the pandemic, when New York City was the center of the global pandemic, Cuomo\u2019s popularity skyrocketed as people from around the country tuned into his blunt-talking daily televised press briefings. His approval ratings rose to 77% \u2013 a record in his nearly 10 years as governor \u2013 and he even developed a global following, especially by comparison to the chaotic briefings given by Donald Trump. \u201cHe represents the kind of leadership we should have in the presidency and don\u2019t,\u201d Jackie Speier, a congresswoman from California, told the New York Times in March. But as the pandemic went on, some of Cuomo\u2019s fame and popularity faded. Instead, the governor started to be criticized for a directive he implemented in March that guided nursing homes \u2013 which ultimately saw more than 6,600 deaths, about a quarter of all deaths in the city \u2013 to accept patients who had or were suspected to have Covid-19. Cuomo amended the order in May, but by that time, nursing homes admitted over 6,000 Covid-positive patients, according to the state\u2019s health department. While reports have said that nursing home staff, not other patients, were the main cause of spread in care homes, some public health experts and nursing home executives have voiced skepticism over such research. Then on Wednesday, the governor lashed out angrily at a press briefing when a reporter asked Cuomo about the news that New York City public schools would close after a recent surge of cases in the city. \u201cLet\u2019s try not to be obnoxious and offensive in your tone,\u201d Cuomo told the reporter. When a fellow reporter said that the question was valid, Cuomo responded: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care what you think.\u201d Some critics on Twitter \u2013 including some Democrats \u2013 are decrying the recognition, saying that it ignores the problems the state has experienced during the pandemic under Cuomo. Max Berger, a Democratic consultant and organizer, on Twitter posted caustically: \u201cThis award makes sense because Cuomo isn\u2019t actually a competent, empathetic Governor \u2013 he just plays one on TV.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
