Yesterday's appearance was Wright's third in four days as he tried to counter the media uproar over his sermons. But his combination of defiance and sarcastic one-liners looked more likely to inflame a controversy that has turned Wright into a hate figure of the rightwing cable networks, and allowed critics to paint Obama as unpatriotic and divisive. Much of yesterday's prepared speech, before a largely African-American audience, was devoted to the history of black US churches. Wright argued the soundbites that have done such damage to the Obama campaign came from a failure to understand traditions of black worship. \"This is not an attack on Jeremiah Wright,\" he said. \"It has nothing to do with Senator Obama. It is an attack on the black church launched by people who know nothing about the African-American religious tradition.\" But that line of thought was quickly overtaken by Wright's testy exchanges with the moderator. Within hours, cable television pundits declared Wright's appearance a disaster for the Obama campaign, complicating its efforts to win over white working class voters in North Carolina and Indiana on May 6. The Republican John McCain on Sunday launched his first attack on Wright. Republicans in North Carolina have used footage of Wright's sermons in attack ads against Democratic candidates. Yesterday Obama, who was campaigning in North Carolina, was forced once again to distance himself from the leader of a church he has attended for 20 years. \"I have said before and I will say again that some of the comments Reverend Wright has made offend me and I understand why they have offended the American people,\" he told reporters. Obama sought last month to answer doubts about Wright with a well-received address on race. But the racial divide exposed by Wright's comments remained palpable. A handful of picketers outside the National Press Club carried signs reading \"Wright is an Obamination\", \"Wright is Wrong\", and \"Chickens Come Home to Roost\". Inside, Wright faced questions such as: \"Do you think people of other races would feel welcome at your church?\" Wright did not disown the most controversial of the soundbites - that America bore some blame for the attacks of 9/11. \"You cannot do terrorism on other people and expect it never to come back on you. Those are biblical principles, not Jeremiah Wright bombastic principles,\" he said. He also praised Louis Farrakhan, who many regard as anti-semitic, as \"one of the most important voices in 20th and 21st century\". And he recalled the Tuskegee experiments, in which hundreds of black men in Alabama went untreated for syphilis so that doctors could study the progress of the disease. \"Based on what has happened to Africans in this country, I believe that our government is capable of doing anything,\" he said. He got the most enthusiastic applause as well as cheers for rejecting the notion that his criticism of the Iraq war or racism in America was unpatriotic. \"My goddaughter's unit arrived in Iraq this week, while those who call me unpatriotic have used their positions of privilege to avoid military service, while sending over 4,000 American boys and girls to die over a lie!\" He took a shot at the vice-president, Dick Cheney, saying: \"I served six years in the military. Does that make me unpatriotic? How many years did Cheney serve?\" It seemed as if Wright was stung by suggestions Obama had sought to distance himself from the man who brought him to the church, and presided over his marriage and the baptism of his two daughters. But Wright said that he has put Obama on notice that if he is elected next November, he can expect his old pastor to be watching. \"I'm coming after you,\" he said. \"Whether he gets elected or not, I'm going to have to be answerable to God.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
