During a period in which a string of senior executives left the FA and a restructuring programme resulted in 100 redundancies, the \u00a310m one-off cost left the organisation with a \u00a312.1m loss. Once one-off items are stripped out, the FA recorded an underlying profit after tax of \u00a33m in 2014-15, down from \u00a35.1m the previous year. It was still able to reinvest a record amount into the game \u2013 \u00a3117m compared with \u00a3115m in 2013-14 \u2013 and the group finance director, Andrew Crean, said the FA had all but achieved its target of \u00a330m in annual savings to reinvest in different areas. The notes to the accounts said the cost of running the FA had increased to \u00a330m from \u00a320m a year because of the one off cost of \u201cimplementing the group\u2019s reorganisation\u201d. Roger Devlin, the independent FA director who chairs the finance committee, said the FA\u2019s financial position was \u201cextremely strong\u201d. \u201cThe future outlook is positive as a result of cost reductions achieved through the restructuring and debt refinancing which has realised a total of \u00a330m in future annual savings,\u201d he said \u201cThis is reflected in our improved cash position, lower running costs and the prospect of enhanced future revenues.\u201d Upon his arrival in May, the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, embarked on a programme to cut 100 jobs and restructure Wembley\u2019s debt in order to \u201cput football first\u201d, releasing the money to be reinvested in key priorities including the England team, coaching and the grassroots. The FA argues that before the restructure its staff was split around 50-50 between football roles and support or administration functions and that the ratio will now be closer to two-thirds to one-third. The Guardian revealed in October that the FA had succeeded in refinancing its Wembley debt and Crean said Wembley and the national football centre at St George\u2019s Park were now on an even keel financially. Negotiations with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are continuing over a groundshare at the national stadium while they rebuild their venues. Crean is confident about the sale of Club Wembley debentures when they come up for renewal in 2017 \u2013 long identified as a crunch point for the FA\u2019s finances. The FA will offer more flexibility to Club Wembley customers over the length of their contracts and the range of services provided. \u201cWe are confident we\u2019ll achieve our target for Club Wembley renewals. Things like the Nations League will help,\u201d he said. With Uefa on the verge of signing a new TV contract for England matches with Sky and ITV on the FA\u2019s behalf that will improve on the existing one that runs to 2018, Crean said it could make decisions about its future from a position of strength. In his foreword, the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, said he stood by his conviction that England\u2019s men could win the World Cup in 2022 and the women could triumph a year later \u201cprovided the hard work is done now\u201d. Dyke returns to his plea for more homegrown players, saying only 22% of those starting Premier League matches last season at the top four clubs were eligible for England, compared with 28% the season before. \u201cOnly a third of players in our top league last season were eligible to play for England despite millions of pounds invested in fantastic academies for, as yet, apparently little return \u2026 something is going wrong and I remain convinced of the need to do something about it.\u201d Glenn highlighted the FA\u2019s commitment to making a \u00a3260m investment in the grassroots over the next four years in four areas: facilities, coaching, participation and \u201cgrowing the football workforce\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is a collective will across the FA to embrace change and put football first. That seems an obvious objective but I\u2019m not always sure it has been the case.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
