Today\u2019s data suggest that damage could be bigger than the financial crisis a decade ago. In the UK and Europe, purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) suggest a deep recession, while the record run of job creation in the US economy finally came to a halt. Here are some of the main developments from today: In the US, non-farm payrolls data showed a loss of 701,000 jobs as unemployment surged to 4.4%. The UK composite PMI came in at 36.0 in March, lower than flash estimates of 37.1. It was a sharp fall from 53.0 in February and marked the lowest level since the survey began in January 1998. Unemployment in Britain and the US could surpass the levels reached during the 1930s Great Depression within months as the coronavirus crisis crushes the global economy, a former Bank of England official has warned. Debenhams, the 242-year-old department store, is considering administration. Legal &amp; General ignored a Bank of England warning to reconsider dividend payouts to shareholders, risking the regulator\u2019s ire. You can continue to follow our coronavirus coverage from around the world. In the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock said that 26m items of personal protective equipment have been delivered across the UK. In the US, New York has reported nearly 3,000 deaths from the virus so far. And in our global coverage, 250,000 European citizens are stranded away from their homes. Thank you for reading, and please join us on Monday bright and early for more coverage of business, economics and markets. JJ British manufacturers are stepping up to the mark with efforts to cover a shortfall in ventilators, a key piece of equipment to battle Covid-19. But doubts are emerging on whether it will be enough. Hospitals could be left without enough medical ventilators at the height of the UK coronavirus outbreak, with manufacturers struggling to build thousands of new machines in time for the likely mid-April peak in cases, write the Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies and Jennifer Rankin. The NHS already has 8,175 ventilators but the government believes up to 30,000 could be needed and has enlisted manufacturers in a wartime-style effort to boost stocks to to at least 61,000. Officials are working on deals to increase that number and are expected to announce new orders for hundreds more machines in the coming days. But sources involved in projects to import or build ventilators told the Guardian that ventilator production was highly unlikely to be in full swing before the end of the month, despite unprecedented collaboration within British industry. The full report can be read here: There is a major row brewing in the insurance industry. Legal &amp; General has just confirmed that it intends to pay out its dividend as planned, despite a stern warning from the Bank of England that insurers should consider the payments to shareholders carefully. European regulators have also urged companies to reconsider making the payouts; it isn\u2019t the best look at a time when people are losing their jobs and hoping their insurance policies will give them some protection. Legal &amp; General\u2019s shares fell by 10% today, the biggest on the FTSE 100, but its statement is pretty unapologetic: The Board continues to pay close attention to the need to protect its customers and employees at this difficult time. The Board has carefully considered the need to act prudently in maintaining safety and soundness, and in so doing ensure that Legal &amp; General plays its full part in supporting the real economy. It also recognises the importance of dividend income to many institutional and retail shareholders, particularly in the current environment. The Board observes that, notwithstanding significant market volatility, the Group\u2019s Solvency position remains robust. Whilst the Board will continue to monitor events, its current intention is to confirm its previous recommendation for a final dividend of 12.64p (2018: 11.82p) giving a full year dividend of 17.57p (2018: 16.42p), 7% higher than 2018. The FTSE 100 loss has been finalised at 1.2%, closing at 5,415.5 points. For the week the FTSE 100 has lost less than 2% - it could almost have been a normal week. But within that there is a lot of variation: On a provisional reading the FTSE 100 has closed down by 1.4% to 5,406 points. France\u2019s Cac 40 lost 1.6%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex gained 2.2%. Germany\u2019s Dax edged down by 0.5%. European oil and gas stocks were the strongest performers among different sectors. The sector rose by 8% - perhaps unsurprisingly given Thursday\u2019s record increase in oil prices. Here is the full report on Debenhams, which is preparing to call in administrators after it was forced to close all its outlets under the coronavirus lockdown. The company, which has 22,000 staff and was rescued by its lenders after collapsing into administration only a year ago, is understood to be considering filing a formal notice of intention to appoint administrators next week, writes the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler. The legal process provides protection from creditors for 10 working days while a company tries to secure a rescue deal. Potential administrators lined up this time around include KPMG, the advisory firm that handled a restructure of Debenhams last May. More here: Approaching the close in Europe the FTSE 100 is down by 1.4%, with something of a late selloff gaining pace. Legal &amp; General is the biggest faller, down 10.7% after EU calls for insurers to abandon dividend payments were backed by the Bank of England. Rolls-Royce, the aerospace manufacturer, lost 9.5%. It may be related to the sale of a large part of its stake by ValueAct, an activist investors. On the FTSE 250 losses have been worse. Shares on the mid-cap index are down by 2.3%. Property company Hammerson is the big loser, down 25%. Companies have been withholding rent payments in its shopping malls, as retailers have little cash to hand. However, the government\u2019s bus bailout has boosted Go-Ahead, with shares up 13%. The move to online video conferencing has been one of the defining features of the crisis so far. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are among the latest to jump on the trend, with decisions to hold \u201cvirtual\u201d annual meetings for the banks. Barclays switched its meeting from Glasgow to London, due to take place on 7 May, and RBS said its AGM would go ahead as planned on 29 April in Edinburgh. Shareholders will be able to vote electronically, but executives won\u2019t get the same kind of in-person barracking that they sometimes do. Here\u2019s an example of discomfort for Barclays boss Jes Staley two years ago. Hell hath no fury like a small shareholder scorned (and given the opportunity to make management squirm). A fair few executives appear to have learned the lesson of the last decade that huge pay packets are not acceptable when workers are struggling. It appears that message has now filtered through to the Premier League, which is closed for lockdown. Premier League players will be asked to take a 30% drop in their wages, via cuts or deferrals or both, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the clubs agreed at a meeting on Friday, writes the Guardian\u2019s David Conn. The move came as the 20 top-flight teams said they would give \u00a3125m to the EFL and National League to help their clubs through the crisis and donate \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups. You can read the full report here: It\u2019s choppy trading on US stock markets today: all three of the major indices have now lost more than 1%. Shares had appeared to shrug off a historically bad non-farm payrolls number, but they have reversed their gains. The boss of one of the world\u2019s biggest makers of personal protective equipment (PPE) has hit back at Donald Trump after the president warned the manufacturer \u201cwill have a big price to pay\u201d and invoked the Defence Production Act to force the manufacturing giant to produce more protective N95 protective masks for the US coronavirus fight. 3M chief executive Mike Roman said accusations of price-gouging and unauthorised reselling is \u201cabsurd\u201d and hit back at administration claims that the company is diverting supplies to overseas markets. He said: I know how the narrative that is propagated broadly, and it\u2019s just not true. [...] The employees of 3M around the world are working around the clock and in the United States to deliver and continue to increase production. The narrative that we are not doing everything we can to maximize delivery is delivery of respirators in our own country \u2026 nothing could be further from the truth. We are doing everything we can to maximise our efforts against Covid-19 and support healthcare workers here in the US. 3M came under attack from the president in a tweet on Thursday evening. \u201cWe hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. \u201cP Act\u201d all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!\u201d Train operator Grand Central, which runs services between Sunderland and Kings Cross, has announced it will suspend running, writes transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. It is the second open-access operator - which run a limited number of trains on bigger networks - in a week to halt operations, following Hull Trains. It had been operating a skeleton service since the outbreak began. Northern has also announced it will cut back its timetable further from Sunday, leaving no trains at all running on some branch lines. The coronavirus pandemic is shuttering large parts of our economy, but some companies are benefiting. Spending on PlayStation more than doubled in March, while local convenience stores such as Nisa and Costcutter recorded a surge in sales, according to the online bank Revolut. But JD Wetherspoon, the pubs chain, was among the biggest losers in the UK. Revolut\u2019s customers are likely to be younger and slightly more urban than account holders at the traditional big banks. But the data \u2013 taken from spending by the digital lender\u2019s 3 million customers from 1-31 March \u2013 gives a strong indication of the consumption patterns that have emerged since the pandemic gripped Britain. And the surprise winner? Online cards company Moonpig. You can read why here: There\u2019s some actual good news in some US economic data just released. The US non-manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) from the Institute of Supply Management has performed much better than economists expected, with a reading of 52.5. That was well above the 44 points expected by economists polled by Reuters. It was the 122nd consecutive month of growth in output. Of course we already know that this is going to tumble, given the number of people who have been laid off in the US already. But at least it shows that there was some life in the US economy before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And US stock markets have turned positive in the last half hour: investors buy the rumour, so the shock of the non-payrolls number was well priced in already. Oil prices are not quite matching yesterday\u2019s record-breaking gains, but those betting prices will rise are not doing too badly either. Investors are betting that oil producers will agree production cuts that will push prices higher. (Whether higher oil prices is good for anyone but the oil companies is another matter - although higher prices are at least correlated with lower carbon emissions.) The price of Brent crude futures has risen by another 12% today, after yesterday\u2019s astonishing 21% gain. One barrel of Brent will set you back $33.42, almost $12 higher than the 18-year low of $21.65 hit on Monday. But despite Donald Trump\u2019s apparent certainty that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed a deal, there is a long way to go before any agreement results in actual production cuts. Here\u2019s the Reuters take: OPEC and its allies are working on a deal for an unprecedented production cut equivalent to about 10% of global supply, an OPEC source said. (Full Story) Oil prices slumped 65% in the first quarter on a demand slump caused by the global coronavirus outbreak and moves by Russia and Saudi Arabia to flood the market after their failure last month to extend much smaller OPEC+ supply cuts. A meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, has been scheduled for Monday, the Azerbaijan energy ministry said, but details on the distribution of production cuts were thin on the ground. The British car industry has only weeks, not months, before many companies run out of money, the sector\u2019s lobby group boss has warned. With every major automotive factory closed in the UK a large proportion of the 800,000 workers in the industry are furloughed, but they will not be able to access government funding to pay 80% of those salaries until the end of the month. Here\u2019s the Reuters report: \u201cThe supply chain are really concerned about how quickly they can access finance because they need it now,\u201d the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Mike Hawes told Reuters. \u201cThey won\u2019t have weeks upon weeks of funding to sustain them,\u201d he said. The temporary suspension of tax contributions on personnel, business rates administered by local councils and a levy on apprenticeships should all be options, he said. \u201cCompanies need cash immediately,\u201d he added. US stock markets have opened lower in the wake of the non-farm payrolls data. (Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to know what kind of reading could have been taken positively given what we know is coming in terms of unemployment numbers.) The benchmark S&amp;P 500 fell 8.36 points, 0.33%, to 2,518.54. The Nasdaq dropped 26 points, or 0.35%, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 84 points or 0.39% to 21,329 points. And a note from earlier: it isn\u2019t a coincidence that two economists quoted earlier, Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, are both commenting on the US labour market at the same time. They are, in fact, a couple. If you want a bit of diversion from what feels like a different age, this Valentine\u2019s Day podcast from NPR\u2019s Planet Money is fun. Debenhams\u2019 owners are preparing to place the venerable department store in administration to protect it from creditors during the coronavirus lockdown, according to Sky News. The company, which was founded as a single shop in 1778, would be one of the most prominent corporate victims of the coronavirus pandemic if it collapses. Most of the company\u2019s employees are already furloughed, with the government to pay 80% of their wages while stores are closed. The Sky report said: The retailer, which employs about 22,000 people, could file a notice of intention to appoint administrators as early as next week. KPMG, the accountancy firm, is understood to be among those on standby to handle the process. [...] Its online operations would continue to trade during any period of insolvency, sources said on Friday. Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, estimates that US unemployment may already have reached an astonishing 13%. Nevertheless, Betsy Stevenson, a former member of the Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and former chief economist at the US labor department, points out that it\u2019s the biggest one-month increase in unemployment since 1975. Here\u2019s a handy animation of what the non-farm payrolls numbers don\u2019t show. Wait for the huge leap at the end... Some reactions to the data are coming in now. The non-farm payrolls number is, unusually, a lagging indicator this month, said James Ingram, investment manager at MB Capital. We know that almost 10m more Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits since the data were collected. He said: Due to the cutoff point, it was expected the number would have largely missed the amount of Americans starting to be laid off or out of work from the corona virus outbreak but this figure of minus 701,000 alongside the jump in the unemployment rate to 4.4% was much worse than had been expected. This brings a brutal end to the 9 year and 5 month run of positive numbers but we expect today\u2019s numbers to be overshadowed by next month\u2019s report by the fact that 10m US workers have made unemployment claims in the last three weeks meaning this could be just the tip of the iceberg. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, an asset manager, said: The US jobs report just confirms what we all know. It\u2019s much worse than expected. The economy is hurting and will be for a while, but markets are maybe getting attuned to the bad data. The key issue is how long it goes on for, rather than just how bad it is in the short term. America\u2019s decade-long record of continual job growth came to a shuddering halt on Frida. Forecasting firm Oxford Economics is predicting a 16% unemployment rate by May with the loss of 27.9m jobs, more than double the 8.7m jobs cut during the 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath. Those jobs were lost over more than two years. If the unemployment climbs above 15%, it would be the highest on record since 1940. Unemployment touched 10% in October 2009 during the last recession. The previous peak was in 1982, when it reached 10.8%. Unemployment during the Great Depression peaked at 24.9% in 1933. You can read the full report here: US stock market futures are still in the red following the non-farm payrolls data. While it was not quite as bad as expected by the most bearish economists, the big negative reading certainly gives little room for near-term optimism. The US economy shed 701,000 jobs according to March data, far more than the 100,000 fall expected on average by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, up from 3.5% in February. Economists\u2019 forecasts had ranged from declines of 100,000 to 1m. A reminder, this data was collected in the middle of last month, before many layoffs, so there could be much worse to come. Let\u2019s have a quick checkup on markets ahead of the non-farm payrolls number: US stock markets are nudging lower. S&amp;P 500 futures are down by 0.6%, as are futures for Dow Jones industrial average index. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 1% to 5,423 points. The US dollar index is up by 0.55% today. Against sterling the dollar is up by 1%, with a pound buying $1.2281. Germany\u2019s Dax index is holding on to gains (just), but France\u2019s Cac 40 and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB are both in the negative, down by 0.5% and 1.3% respectively. And it\u2019s Jasper Jolly taking over from Kalyeena to take you through the next few hours. The travel and tourism industry has stepped up calls for the government to relax rules on consumer refunds, warning that firms risk bankruptcy and the taxpayer will pick up the tab without more flexibility. Customers whose holidays are postponed or cancelled are entitled to refunds within 14 days - and many will urgently want the money back, with their own jobs affected and livelihoods at risk. However, travel agencies say they have not had that money returned from hotels or airlines, and without revenues from new bookings simply do not have the cash. The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council has urged the government to show \u201cexceptional flexibility\u201d, as current rules and \u201ccrushing financial pressure\u201d could see major bankruptcies, which would lead to consumers claiming on government bonded schemes anyway. According to travel association Abta, the UK is lagging behind other EU countries in reforming the rules to avoid a wholesale collapse. It has proposed temporary reforms, including: Extending the 14-day window for refunds to four months; The government underwriting \u201crefund credits\u201d which would guarantee an eventual cash refund should delayed holidays not go ahead And an emergency fund to cover consumer hardship, repaying customers when airlines or hotels can or will not refund tour operators. Over in media and telecoms news, companies are rushing to assure that they\u2019ve got the crisis under control. Firstly, ITV has been added to the list of execs eschewing pay in light of the lockdown. My colleague Mark Sweney has the details: And if anyone was worried that the telecoms giants might buckle under the weight of homeworking, BT has assured it\u2019s got things covered... The countdown is on for the US non-farm payrolls report. At 1.30pm BST, Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its first monthly jobs report since the Covid crisis hit the US, which is expected to show the first net decline in more than nine years. But we\u2019ve seen a wild discrepancy in forecasts, ranging from declines of -100,000 to -1million, so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess at this point. Most of you will already have seen yesterday\u2019s headlines, showing that more than 6.65 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week. However, the thing to keep in mind with the \u201cMarch\u201d data we get this afternoon, is that it was collected in the middle of last month, before major companies like General Electric, Macy\u2019s, Marriott and others laid off workers. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, explains: We\u2019re waiting for the data to confirm what we already know. The record one hundred-month plus stretch of jobs growth in the US has come to screeching halt. The non-farm payroll figure for March is expected to turn negative. Because the data was collected in the first half of the month, its unlikely to capture the full damage from forced lockdowns and stay home advice. The really hideous stuff will probably show up in the April numbers. In our full write up of UK and eurozone PMI\u2019s, Claus Vistesen captures most people\u2019s reaction to the bloc\u2019s business activity figures: In one line: horrid, hideous, harrowing \u2026 you get the picture. We are struggling to come up with words to describe these numbers, which are now so far out of any reasonable range that they are difficult to interpret. You can find the full story here: \u201cThe likelihood of a global recession is now a given.\u201d That\u2019s according to Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which publishes the PMI market data. Commenting on the latest UK services figures, Brock said: The services sector was sucked into a black hole and flung into the unknown by the forceful impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus, affecting every area of supply chains from transport to purchasing levels and job creation. The abrupt drop in new orders was the sharpest since the survey began in 1996 according to the PMI data. Export orders were hit particularly hard and, in some cases, dissolved into nothing as border closures and travel restrictions resulted in the immediate cessation of normal business activities. He adds that this had a severe knock-on effect on employment, with job losses jumping to levels last seen in June 2009. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to find the words to describe the devastation as every region in the world fights to save human life as the first priority. The likelihood of a global recession is now a given, though its duration and severity has yet to reveal itself. One thing is for certain, with the lowest business optimism for over 20 years, the immediate outlook for the services sector is beyond grim. And in case you\u2019d like a visual representation of what\u2019s been going on between Moscow and Riyadh: More on the oil price moves amid reports that Opec+ (the cartel led by Saudi Arabia and Russia) is set to hold a virtual meeting on Monday. Here is the latest from our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose: Global oil markets appear torn between hope and despair after US President Donald Trump triggered the fastest oil price surge in history by claiming to have brokered a ceasefire in Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil price war. The oil price retreated from its biggest ever one day gain on Thursday by tumbling from brief highs of $33 a barrel to below $29 in early trade as growing scepticism of the President\u2019s claim set in. Since then, the price of Brent crude has climbed back above the $30 a barrel mark, nearly 20 per cent higher than its levels 24 hours earlier, after Opec sources reportedly confirmed that the cartel is debating whether they can make the cuts. Trump\u2019s tweet claiming that Riyadh and Moscow plan to put aside their rivalry to strike a deal which would cut at least 10 million barrels a day from global production may have been premature - but, for now, the market is pricing in the chance it just might happen. Unsurprisingly, European stocks have fallen even further since the disappointing PMI data this morning. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has suffered the worst decline amongst its blue chip peers, down -1.5%. Away from the top tier, the FTSE 250 is down -1.8%. Newsflash: China is slashing the amount of cash that small and medium sized banks have to hold as reserves, to help pump more liquidity into the economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China is expected to cut the reserve requirement ratio by a total of 100 basis points, split between April and May. It is expected to release around 400 billion yuan (\u00a346bn) into the Chinese market, according to reports. The move is part of attempts to support China\u2019s economy, as it starts to emerge from the coronavirus crisis. Senior management at Primark\u2019s parent group Associated British Food have agreed to cut their pay in half during the coronavirus crisis, our colleague and retail Sarah Butler explains. George Weston, the chief executive, John Bason, finance director, and Paul Marchant, the boss of Primark, are all cutting pay by 50%. Bonuses relating to the current financial year will also not be paid to the executive directors on ABF\u2019s board. The group\u2019s non-executive directors, including the chairman Michael McLintock, have reduced their pay by 25%. The company said that the pay cuts were appropriate as they now expected full year earnings to be \u201cmuch lower than envisaged at the start of the financial year.\u201d That exceeds cuts announced by bus and train operator Go-Ahead Group. This morning Go-Ahead confirmed management would take a 20% pay cut as it, and other bus companies, welcomed \u00a3167m in government aid to keep commuter services running for essential staff during the lockdown. More from Reuters on that Go-Ahead story here. While all of the decline in business activity across the UK and eurozone aren\u2019t necessarily be surprising given the coronavirus lockdown, the falls are proving even worse than initial estimates and are causing a re-think about how severe the contraction will actually be. The beleaguered airline industry may have at least one rescue package on the horizon. Air France-KLM is said to be in talks with banks about securing a multibillion euro loan package backed by both the French and Dutch governments. Air France may get as much as \u20ac4bn euros in French-guaranteed loans while KLM could get close to \u20ac2bn backed by The Hague, Reuters reported, citing sources. Taken alone, the UK services sector suffered its steepest decline for more than two decades. The reading came in at 34.5 for March, below flash readings of 35.7 and down from 53.2 in February. The report from IHS Markit/CIPs explains: The slump in activity was almost exclusively linked by survey respondents to business shutdowns and cancelled orders in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. That exceeded the previous record low logged during the height of the global financial crisis. It was also the fastest downturn for the services sector since the survey started in July 1996. That is despite an uptick in technology services, where there were pockets of expansion (which is pretty much to be expected following the surge in remote home working). You can read the full survey here. There\u2019s been no relief for the UK either. UK composite PMI came in at 36.0 in March, which is even lower than flash estimates of 37.1. That is a sharp fall from 53.0 in February and marks the lowest level since the survey began in January 1998. The IHS Markit/CIPS survey notes that there has been a slightly faster reduction in private sector output than seen at the at the height of the financial crisis, when the index fell to 38.1 in November 2008. Commenting on the shocking drop in Eurozone business activity, IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist Chris Williamson says: The data indicate that the eurozone economy is already contracting at an annualised rate approaching 10%, with worse inevitably to come in the near future. The service sector is currently seeing an especially severe impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, with travel, tourism, restaurants and other leisure activities all hit hard by virus containment measures. No countries are escaping the severe downturn in business activity, but the especially steep decline in of Italy\u2019s service sector PMI to just 17.4 likely gives a taste of things to come for other countries as closures and lockdowns become more prevalent and more strictly enforced in coming months. A combined reading of the Eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and services sectors shows the biggest ever single monthly fall in March. The composite PMI reading was the lowest ever recorded as part of the survey, at 29.7. That was not only down from February\u2019s 51.6, it was also weaker than the earlier flash estimate of 31.4. More PMI data makes for grim reading of Europe\u2019s economic outlook: Correction: In my intro, I\u2019ve corrected the Caixin services sector data which came out this morning. The reading was 43.0, signalling a contraction, but at a slower rate than February when the reading was 26.5. Italy, which is has suffered most from the Covid-19 outbreak in Europe, experienced a sharp contraction across its services industry last month. Italy\u2019s services PMI came in at 17.4 compared to a Reuters poll forecasting a reading of 22.0. That\u2019s a significant fall from February when it was still in expansion territory at 52.1. In a broader view of industry performance, Italy\u2019s composite PMI plunged from 50.7 in February to 20.2 in March. With minutes to go until our next PMI reading (next up: Italy), time to check in on oil prices. Despite slipping overnight, Brent prices are back up over the 30-dollar mark, rising more than 1.7% on the session to $30.52. You\u2019ll remember yesterday\u2019s whopping 30% jump in prices, following Donald Trump\u2019s tweet, which suggested that both Russia and Saudi Arabia might be ready to cut output by as much as 15m barrels a day. Those comments were (slightly) dampened after Putin\u2019s spokesman reportedly told journalists that \u201cno one has started talking about any specific or even abstract deals\u201d. And in the first of a string of PMI data out this morning, Spain\u2019s services sector performed worse than expected in March. Economists had been expecting a reading of 25.5, according to a Reuters poll. But even that wasn\u2019t pessimistic enough, with the actual figure coming in at 23.0, down from 52.1 a month earlier. A reminder that 50 is the neutral reading, and any reading below signals a contraction in the sector. It\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag of companies that are making up the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning: European stock markets are open and have followed Asia\u2019s lead into negative territory: FTSE 100 down -0.7% Germany\u2019s DAX down -0.4% France\u2019s CAC 40 down -0.4% Spain\u2019s IBEX down -0.2% And Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 has fallen 0.4% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Despite a positive end to trading on Wall Street, new services PMI data out of China has hit sentiment and sent Asian stocks and US futures back into the red. The Caixin services PMI showed the country that first bore the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak is still struggling to return to normalcy. The reading of 43 was up from 26.5 a month earlier. It shows a sector still struggling to reach expansion territory, and one which is nowhere near the levels of growth that economists have come to expect from the Asian nation. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: Stocks in Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney traded in the red, as all three US majors were pulled lower. The Caixin services PMI confirmed a slower contraction in the Chinese activity, but the number also illustrated that life in China has certainly not gotten to a normal pace just yet, with the manufacturing being an exception to this. We will be keeping an eye on a swathe of data out of Europe and the US, which is expected to confirm a sharp contraction in economic activity and employment.
