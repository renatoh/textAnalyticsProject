The letter below said that the Royal Navy submarine Astute, which recently ran into a sand bar off the Isle of Skye, was a Trident-missile bearing submarine. In fact this type of boat is not armed with nuclear missiles. It carries Tomahawk cruise missiles. According to Trident Ploughshares, one Trident submarine commands enough fire power to destroy every major city in the northern hemisphere. That one should be hung up on a sand bar off the Isle of Skye (Report, 23 October) is more than disconcerting. The UK could lead the world in disarming these illogical, fallible and immoral instruments of extinction. Think of how many social programmes could be saved if the Trident fleet were put out to pasture. Child benefits, the NHS, education, housing and help for the infirm and disabled could all greatly benefit from scrapping the UK nuclear arsenal. Dr Kathleen Sullivan Hibakusha Stories, New York \u2022 The Royal Navy's scorecard over recent years is not looking too good: newest submarine aground near Skye; new carrier approved, but no aeroplanes for it; nuclear submarine has accident with French nuclear sub under the Atlantic; navy puts Royal Marines ashore on Spanish beach rather than Gibraltar during exercise; sailors and marines captured and publicly humiliated by Iran after Gulf incident; crew fatalities in nuclear sub accident under north pole; HMS Endurance floods in the South Atlantic and has to be \"carried\" home on a special merchant ship; HMS Nottingham runs into underwater rock off Australia. David Macdonald Sturminster Marshall, Dorset \u2022 Of what use are aircraft carriers when unequipped, or unrequired, for active warfare (Ian Jack, 23 October)? A large carrier has medical and surgical resources adequate for the needs of a small town. It has interior and exterior storage space capable of holding enormous quantities of emergency supplies \u2013 tents, blankets, food and water, and equipment, from generators to bulldozers. And it can readily carry all that is needed for transport \u2013 heavy-lift helicopters, launches and all-terrain vehicles. What better means exist for the provision of rapid and comprehensive aid for overseas areas hit by natural disasters? Tom Poole Leominster, Herefordshire \u2022 In 1967 when, aged 15, I joined the navy, it had about 200 ships. My nephew is completing his training to join a fleet with 17 ships. Thank goodness we are not an island nation which relies on maritime trade. Gary Grindrod Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
