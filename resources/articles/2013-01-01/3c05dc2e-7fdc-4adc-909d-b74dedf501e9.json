Perhaps Nick's fascination with art began when, at the age of eight, he witnessed an older friend painting a landscape in which she coloured one of the trees completely red. This puzzled and impressed him, and the memory stayed. As a teenager, Nick began to paint and to take a great interest in the work of artists, particularly Ren\u00e9 Magritte, whose pictures delighted him for the rest of his life. At this time he started to acquire what became a thorough and detailed knowledge of art history. Following Maidstone grammar school, he did an art foundation course at Canterbury College of Art, and from there went to Goldsmiths in London, where he achieved a first-class honours degree in fine art. In later years, he did an MA in fine art at Cardiff Institute of Higher Education. Nick's method of working was slow and sometimes painstaking: he made art steadily over a period of 42 years, until his death. He used a variety of materials and forms, but most often produced paintings. In 2009, he wrote: \"To varying degrees, a lot of my work has attempted to give concrete form to two everyday observations. First, I am amazed by the wonder of visual representation, and in particular by the way paint can be seen as a physical substance, an area of colour, or the image of something else. Second, I will never quite come to terms with the profusion and the mute impenetrability of material things. There are always unfamiliar objects to see, while familiar objects retain their mystery and beauty.\" He exhibited work when he could and created a comprehensive website where his creations could (and still can) be viewed. Sadly, he was never able to earn a living from his art as he would have liked. Other sources of deep satisfaction to Nick included listening to music and walking in the countryside around our home in Wales. A loving and caring husband and father, Nick was completely devoted to his family and felt an immense pride in our two sons, Joe and Jack. He is survived by me, Joe and Jack, his mother, Joan, and his two brothers, Lawrence and Paul."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
