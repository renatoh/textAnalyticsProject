Saints hit rock bottom last week when Eastmond was suspended indefinitely for making an obscene gesture at supporters during their home defeat by Harlequins, but it was surely no coincidence that in his absence they produced comfortably their best performance of the year. Jonny Lomax, a gifted utility back who switched from centre to fill in at scrum half alongside the equally raw stand-off Lee Gaskell, exerted far more influence on the match than Eastmond had in any of his five appearances this season, but Saints were equally well served by the veteran Paul Wellens at full-back, while the young left wing Jamie Foster collected 18 points from two tries and five goals from as many attempts. The Saints coach, Royce Simmons, expects the directors to announce the results of their investigation into the allegations against Eastmond this week, but this performance will surely have stiffened their resolve to send him on his way to his new life with Bath sooner rather than later, allowing the club to move on without him. They fell 10-6 and 16-12 behind in a rollercoaster second half, with Leeds continuing the theme of promising young talent as Zak Hardaker and Paul McShane scored tries \u2013 Hardaker's coming courtesy of a refereeing howler that was one of the few lowlights of the night. Saints ensured it would not prove decisive, with Michael Shenton scoring one try from Gaskell's accurate kick, and Francis Meli then bringing them level again at 16-16 by surging through an alarmingly large gap in the Leeds defence with 17 minutes remaining. Foster, who had already converted his own first-half try from wide out, added another excellent kick to nudge Saints ahead, and then collected the ball behind his back and planted it down in the corner for his second try after Wellens had crashed over for the clincher. Leeds also played their part in the entertainment, but have still to find the balance between devil-may-care handling and sensible rugby league. Still, even if these teams no longer dominate Super League as they used to, they retain the knack of putting on a show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
