But Suzy Almond's remarkable first full-length play offers variations on a familiar theme by using music as a practical metaphor and by suggesting that the teacher is often as badly screwed-up as the taught. Almond's four-hander is set in a south London comprehensive and focuses on the edgy relationship between tough-girl Charlie and supply teacher Miss Fry. Charlie is a brattish 15-year-old whose main love is a Hollister motorbike, which she dreams of taking on a show-off drive round town. But Miss Fry, a frustrated songwriter who used to play in a blues band, discovers in Charlie a natural talent for music. Over a series of detention lessons, we see Miss Fry trying to turn Charlie from a bike girl into a piano girl and allow her latent creativity to overcome her destructiveness. The situation is ripe with sentimental opportunities, all of which Almond strenuously resists. What she actually shows is two solitary misfits with a ruthless eye for each other's weaknesses. Charlie sees right through Miss Fry's lack of educational commitment - the kind of dedication symbolised by the rash-like \"map of Africa\" that comes up on the maths teacher's neck. Equally, Miss Fry paints a devastating portrait of the future that awaits disruptive troublemakers such as Charlie: \"Fortysomething and still finding her name on toilet walls.\" For each of them music offers the one hope of redemption. But, even here, Almond resists facile uplift by showing the teacher interrupting Charlie's piano practice to find a missing chord that will resolve one of her own songs. Occasionally Almond's plotting is suspect: a confidential report on Charlie is left lying about too conveniently. But the strength of the play lies in its understanding of the surrogate war that commonly passes for education. As Charlie says of teachers, \"You've gotta make them wanna know what's going on in your head.\" Almond also shows music-making as a strange mix of private obsession and communal creation. In Jonathan Lloyd's fine production, set in a suitably dingy school hall, the two piano-playing leads beautifully combine built-in solitude with fleeting contact. Brooke Kinsella as Charlie wonderfully conveys an obstinate resistance to her musical gifts and Tracy-Ann Oberman is equally good as the teacher torn between her own career and her pupil's potential. Bryan Dick and Daniel Scott-Croxford as Charlie's mutinous acolytes lend plausibility to a first-rate play in which any optimism is distinctly hard-earned. \u0095 Until July 21.
