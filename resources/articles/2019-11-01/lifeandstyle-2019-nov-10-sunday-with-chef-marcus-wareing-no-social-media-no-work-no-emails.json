At least half in our family home in East Sussex. I like the peace and quiet. Is it a slow start? I find it hard to sleep in \u2013 I want to be up early and enjoy full days now. I\u2019m a boxing fanatic and record the US fights overnight and watch them while everyone is still asleep. Then we all pile into the kitchen for breakfast. We take it in turns to cook. Our kitchen is like a caf\u00e9 that never seems to close. The best spot for a Sunday bite? Light on the Common in Wimbledon does a great English breakfast. If I\u2019m in the city that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be. Do you visit your own restaurants? Now and again I pop in with my son for a spot check to see how service is going, or for a quick bite to eat. Usually I stay away, though. For years I was in the kitchen every weekend. Do you always go out? No thanks. I\u2019d rather be at home. I spend my life around people and talking: to customers, to our team. So on Sunday that\u2019s the last thing I want to do. No social media, no work, no emails. What\u2019s your soundtrack to Sunday? Talkradio. I find listening to what people think can be educational \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon for a caller to change my mind. It\u2019s a way I can engage in the conversation without having to talk. Worst Sunday habit? Popping into the garden and not returning for 12 hours. My wife, somewhat pissed off, has to find me in the dark, usually doing something stupid like chopping down a tree. The perfect night in? I\u2019ve only just discovered box sets. For a long time I\u2019d only watch shows live on television, to be part of something, but that\u2019s all changing now. What\u2019s better than a good murder mystery and a bottle of white Burgundy?
