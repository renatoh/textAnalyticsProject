Just spoke to mandy think he should give statement telling [word omitted] BBC to [word omitted] lay off me and nobody has told him to do it. Thank god that [word omitted] liabilaty is out of the country and not getting up Gorden's nose. Now [word omitted] off and cover something important you [word omitted]! OF COURSE, I MEANT TO SAY Sorry about that. It shouldn't have ended up in a family-friendly email like the Backbencher, but she's been having trouble with her Blackberry. As Alastair was trying to say, Peter Mandelson warned the BBC on Tuesday not to portray Alan Milburn's replacement as a foul-mouthed, bad-tempered creature with an inability to master basic technology. She hopes that's absolutely clear. LADIES FIRST \"We believe that any woman who allows herself to be put on an imposed all-woman shortlist - as is the case in the Calder Valley constituency as of today - cannot credibly call herself a Conservative.\" At least, that's how several Tory ladies put it in a letter to the Telegraph on Saturday. And how right they are. Even as they were expressing their views of those pernicious shortlists, Conservatives in Calder Valley were picking an anti-monarchist ex-Lib Dem to represent them in the Tories' first all-women shortlist selection meeting. LITTLE BEAU PEEP The Backbencher's editor hauled her in last week for the conversation every columnist dreads. \"We need more [word omitted] in the Backbencher. We need to be more like Wonkette,\" he said. It became clear that he wasn't referring to [word omitted] in the Campbell sense, but to the actual [word omitted] content of the Backbencher. Sadly, the prudishness of your email filters and the lack of a picture facility in this email means that any regular [word omitted] will just have to be outsourced, no matter what the implications for her own job. So she is grateful to the Heinz School for this picture of Democratic \"big-time hottie\" and keen skier, motorbiker and basketball player Chris Heinz, who also happens to be Teresa's youngest son. Nominations for next week's pin-up are more than welcome. We'll take MEPs, we'll take Americans - we'll even accept MPs and PPCs. Email, as ever, backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. THROUGH THE HEDGEGROW Those of you who have been longing to penetrate Ann Widdecombe's secret garden - and no, the Backbencher doesn't want to know who you are - will find their desires amply fulfilled by this stolen paparazzo shot of Ann's private pool. Just don't try eating the toadstool. A MAN OF INFLUENCE Just before 8pm last Wednesday, Phil Hope - under-secretary of state in Prescott's office - rounded off what he called an \"interesting and lively\" debate on council tax - \"though though we have occasionally witnessed what I think could be described as tired and emotional interventions from the Opposition whips.\" Could he have been referring to the removal from the chamber of Tory whip David Ruffley? Fortunately, his fellow whips were on hand to help David leave, but suggestions that the Bury St Edmunds MP was inebriated are surely misguided. This is the MP, after all, who recently told the Daily Politics show that \"we all know of the problems that exist ... when alcohol is taken in excessive amounts. ... The consequences of binge drinking are very serious.\" In particular: \"There should be stronger powers to control late licences to prevent disorder hotspots, where they are too many bars or pubs in a vicinity.\" How very true. With eight bars to serve 650-odd MPs and their hangers-on, the Palace of Westminster must be one of the worst offenders. LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION As Kathryn Whelan pointed out, the lord chancellor's job title was saved for posterity last week and his judicial duties handed over to Lord Woolf - who, all being well, will soon enjoy the title of President of the Courts of England and Wales. Ede &amp; Ravenscroft must be delighted. That robe will have to be something pretty special. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week, the Backbencher has a copy of Samuel Brittan's Against The Flow: Reflections of an Individualist to give away. This is an enjoyable collection of short essays which, since most of them have appeared in the FT or magazines, are just the right length for the individualist to enjoy on the commute into work. For a chance of winning it, just identify the European citizens described here: \"They are not very numerous. This is the main thing everybody knows about them ... A touch of paradox characterises the local gastronomy. ... True to their motto: \"we want to stay as we are\", they continue to insist on distinguishing themselves by not being like the others, while nevertheless being close to the others. Neither exactly the same, nor completely different, they place themselves between the two extremes of either combining all the faults of other Europeans, which would be a nightmare, or combining all their positive attributes, which would be a bad dream. And since the positive attributes of the one are considered to be faults by the others (and vice versa), making a synthesis impossible, any wish to make homo [word omitted] a prototype of homo europaeus will prove illusory.\" If only Freud had been able to pause en route from Austria to Hampstead. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher asked the Guardian's political editor, Michael White, about the significance to Tony Blair's apology to the 11 people wrongly imprisoned for the IRA attacks in Guildford and Woolwich 31 years ago. \"In the bad days of the Troubles back in the 1970s - particularly when there were very serious bombings on the British mainland - dreadful things were done in a hurry, and people were wrongly convicted. This matters enormously to the republican and nationalist communities. So honour is being set aside, old debts acknowledged, and the slate wiped clean. \"But there is another side to this, of course, and it's the more difficult side, particularly for republicans. Despite the setbacks for devolved government in Stormont, life has moved on enormously in the city centres of Belfast and Londonderry. They are utterly transformed since the ceasefire. But it means that debts have got to be settled the other way, and the British and Irish governments have joined forces and said to Sinn Fein and the IRA: look, there's been a bit of latitude, we've cut you a bit of slack over things that have gone on in the nationalist communities in west Belfast and elsewhere these last few years, as the paramilitaries have settled down and begun to resume a relatively normal life. But the bank robbery at the Northern Bank - which we all agree you did - that can't be tolerated. You're either in the peace process or you're not. You're committed to legality or you're not. You can't have one hand on the ballot box and the other hand holding a knife. It's got to be a democratic, legitimate political party. \"Of course, the Irish government feels that strongly too, because Bertie Ahern has watched Sinn Fein make inroads in some of the poorer constituencies in Dublin and knows that if any of that money from the Northern Bank raid helped to fund elections in Ireland - well, that would make his life difficult. So he has a very practical domestic reason for stamping on this hard. And by the same token, people on the other side of the community divide in Ulster would like to know where bodies were buried and people were murdered - and not all of them Protestant, either. So this process goes on - a slow painful unwinding of a harsh past - and on a day like today, it's probably worth noting that a decade or so ago hopes were high of peace between Israel and Palestine and then it slipped back. But in both places, peace may be around the corner.\" FORTHCOMING EVENT February 15, 12.30pm-2pm: Correlli Barnet delivers a lecture on 'Post-conquest civil affairs policy: a comparison between Iraq 2003-4 and Germany 1945-46' at the Foreign Press Association, 11 Carlton House Terrace, SW1.
