You were exercised about Vista's sound, whether the lazy win online and the Wii. Click through for the full text... SOUND VISTA In your article on Vista audio (\"Why Vista sounds worse\", 31st Jan 2008) I was surprised that you didn't mention the controversy surrounding the DRM aspects. Essentially, it appears that Vista artificially introduces a lot of overhead encrypting and decrypting data whilst passing it around internally, and also, in some cases, deliberately downgrades the quality of its audio and video output. Bruce Schneier has mentioned this but a more comprehensive exploration of the way in which Vista (mis)handles audio is available. Might these issues be of far greater relevance than the claim, in your article, that the drivers just aren't ready yet? Richard Kemp, Abingdon [Tim Anderson comments: Nobody I talked to thought that DRM was to blame: the \"protected media path\" is apparently not involved in ordinary audio playback.] I posted a couple of quotes from the article on my OU (Language) students' Conference Website, with due acknowledgements of course, in the hope it might help fellow students. Basically, quite a few of the students are having problems with Vista and audio software, so I thought they should read the article. One student, however, took issue by saying her husband (he works for worldwide semi-conductor firm and is a software engineer) thought the article was wrong! She says, \"All audio goes through the kernal (sic!) and nothing in Windows can bypass it, as its also the memory controller\". She further asserts that \"the reason everything goes through the kernel, is because thats where the Security layer is...\" \"All OS's do this..even OSX.\" I read the Guardian everyday and consider the Technology pages to be very informative and professional. I would very much like to refute what she says, but not being an IT expert can do little but recommend the article. Is there anything you could say to enlighten me further, please; Tim Anderson's qualifications would be a boost? I am not a Vista user, having steam XP still. Bill Headdon, Tunbridge Wells &gt;&gt; In general, because the interplay between pro audio hardware and software is so complicated, there's little incentive for engineers to replace systems that work well - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But in this case, even if their PCs went belly up tomorrow, they'd stick with XP. blogs.cnet.com REWARDING THE LAZY? &gt;&gt; the title (The internet rewards the lazy and punishes the intrepid) led me to think: what ever happened to long term business planning? Are companies ever built to last or are they built to flip? My vantage point is skewed because I work on the Web, where 1 year is an eternity for some and the notion of creating, building and holding a business for 10 years is nearly impossible (\"it will be shut down or sold\"). watchmojo.com/web/blog &gt;&gt; More people want to share the adventure of surfing. This annoys an elite who are looking for that greater challenge. Underneath the rhetoric of adventure, this is just another complaint from a threatened elite. Surfers detest the effects of the great unwashed. If they are so annoyed, they can buy the beaches, rather than destroy property. The answer for Carr is a fence. thebewilderness.typepad.com/my_weblog/ &gt;&gt; This is plain rubbish. The technology that informed people to move from the first bottleneck due to real time traffic information will also inform people about how traffic is diverging away from the first bottleneck. It will help drivers make an informed decision about their route and, in fact, an intelligent system may even help the driver route better based on instantaneous analysis of traffic divergence from the first bottleneck. krishworld.com/blog/ &gt;&gt; isn't sharing your knowledge about such [new] things part of the fun of finding them? Not for Nick, apparently. Maybe we could share that kind of thing with a few other bold types, provided we like the cut of their jib or whatever, but not with the riff-raff. Come to think of it, maybe we should copyright those shortcuts and surfing hotspots. There's an idea. What do you say, Nick? mathewingram.com/work/ &gt;&gt; Nick sounds like the people who discover a new cool band, watch them play in small clubs, then when they make it big, turn away in disgust. Where I agree with Nick is that the lag time between discovery and commoditization is getting shorter and shorter -- trends move faster and are more transient, cool experiences are shared across geographies and demographics more rapidly than ever and the inaccessible is no accessible. Heck, I call this a good thing.... glasshouse.waggeneredstrom.com/blogs/ PAYING TO NETWORK &gt;&gt; The issue with such a business model is always going to be dilution of the audience. Web site owners are going to wonder how much more difficult it is to simply set up their own application rather than add someone else's to get all of the revenue instead of a portion of it. And shared revenue can only go so far when it has to sustain a company AND pay the users as well. The more users who sign up, the smaller the piece of the pie for each of them, at which point they'll most likely move on to the next similar company that promises a higher payout. profy.com/ &gt;&gt; Come on, guys, this is the most basic business principle - you don't pay your users. You give them products and services and they pay you the money. You may enjoy it a little bit now but it won't be sustainable in future. blog.santoshmaharshi.com/ MUSIC BUSINESS Victor Keegan (We'll pay the piper if we like the tune, January 31) says that market research would show that people want simple inexpensive downloads of music. Well, those that download do, but that's not for everyone. Don't forget that: * packaged music (CDs) with explanatory, etc notes is attractive to many; * not everyone is interested just in 'songs'; * not everyone likes or uses MP3 players or wants mobile music; * minority - non-pop - tastes are poorly served by services like iTunes; The 'music industry' as depicted in the press tends to relate to the small number of major global companies who dominate - don't forget the long tail that entertains the rest of us. Choice in supply methods is needed. Ian Winship, Newcastle-upon-Tyne MICROSOFT NATURAL KEYBOARD (TECHNOPHILE) I bought a Microsoft Natural Desktop keyboard 4000 a couple of months ago and it provided me with my favourite error message so far (no fault of Microsoft). Whenever I've bought a keyboard before I have never bothered to install any software that might have been included. I didn't realise that the software had to be installed for this keyboard, so I just plugged in and switched on. The computer failed to boot, and the error message was: \"Keyboard malfunction. Press F1 for Help\". Mm. Press F1 on a keyboard that isn't working? Iain Fenton, Alva MECTRICITY Did we go metric in the 70s (Letters January 24 and 31)? Technology Guardian isn't sure: In 'Is a US spy satellite going to land on my head' (January 31, p.2) we hear that recently \"a 600ft asteroid zoomed passed us at a distance of just 538,000km.\" Give those writers an inch and they'll take a... Bob Rotheram, Nottingham WII KNOW I read Charles Arthur's piece on games consoles (Technology 31.1.2008) waiting for him to to make the key observation, but he never did. As Bill Clinton might have said: it's the controller, Stupid. Nick Radcliffe, Edinburgh &gt;&gt; I find fault with the implied definition of hardcore gamers, here, in that they don't play Wii but choose Xboxes and PlayStations. Mario Galaxy is more a gamer's game than Grand Theft Auto. headlessness.com/ &gt;&gt; It would appear that, big surprise, people like playing games with other people. Even more folks think there is more to life than button mashing. The genius part of it all, however, is that it was all done without the benefit of the gamer market. 'Keep it simple and stupid' as they say, or maybe that should be 'keep it simple and social'? pclive.wordpress.com/ EXPLORER PISA (ONLINE ONLY) \"How Internet Explorer became as wonky as the Leaning Tower of Pisa: Builders know this: if you get it wrong at the foundations, then the structure will never be right, no matter how hard you try. Look at the Tower of Pisa, built on too-soft ground. Despite enormous modern efforts (pumping concrete beneath one side, steel hawsers), it's impossible to straighten.\" Thought you'd like to know the truth about this one. They have now stabilised the Leaning tower of Pisa and indeed, straightened it up a little. They only didn't straighten it up completely because of the massive loss of of such an iconic tourist attraction! Ok, so getting the foundations wrong is pretty critical, but they can do some amazing things these days - such as picking up your whole house and moving somewhere else! Sorry, couldn't resist the correction. Steve Baines (architect), Nottingham ONLINE SHARING With regards to the Jan 25, 2008 article (online), entitled \"All This Online Sharing Has Got to Stop,\" I could not disagree more with the author. Online sharing is simply the direction things are moving. To say that grandmothers shouldn't be allowed to exchange needlepoint patterns, or listeners music, or readers written media, is to entirely defeat the democratic nature of the internet. If anything, sellers and marketers should strive to convince people that it is WRONG to exchange copyrighted media over the internet, rather than simply attempting to prevent it (which will not ever be successful, because for every tech guru at a company, there is a hacker who can get around their safeguards). When you take away free porn, shared music, shared text files, and \"How To's\" from the internet, all you have left is a shopping mall that can enter peoples homes and hawk its wares. Maybe instead of punishing the customers for finding the easiest and cheapest way to get what they want, sellers and marketers should actually pay attention to what the customers are doing, and learn how to market to them better. Anyway, good article, but lay off the internet. It sounds like you want us to go back to the time when customers blindly accepted the prices of things that were served up by the umbrella corporations, and everyone was constantly royally screwed by profiteering executives. It may not be perfect, but the internet provides a sort of enlightenment to consumers that could lead to an economic renaissance if allowed to flourish, rather than letting the greed of current monopolies stifle communication and lead us back into the cave of ignorance from which we are just starting to emerge.
