That's the critically important question left unanswered by last week's Home Affairs Committee report. After the most extensive consultation and deliberation since the 1981 Scarman report, the influential cross-party parliamentary committee offers 76 recommendations to address the alarming number of black people flowing into the criminal justice system. The report is most remarkable for what it does not say. Absent is New Labour's weary language of popular punitiveness. The word \"tough\" is nowhere to be found. There is no call for \"zero tolerance\", harsher sentences or more prisons. Instead, the committee calls on the government to \"review, revise and redouble\" its efforts to prevent young black people from ever entering the criminal justice system. It recognises that preventing criminalisation lies in social justice not criminal justice, and its focus is social exclusion, poverty, substandard housing, inadequate amenities, drugs, community mental health and the need for positive role models - broad social problems that have fallen particularly harshly on young black Britons. Despite its progressive tone, there are areas where the report falls short. It laments that, soon, 75% of young black males will be on the DNA database, and expresses concern about disproportionate arrest rates and the dramatically increasing black prison population. However, the committee never quite grasped the corrosive effect of police practices that unjustifiably target black people. Long-term damage has been caused by decades of criminalisation, a fact the report fails to drive home. This caveat noted, the report should be welcomed and implemented in full. It is clear that this must involve central and local government, as well as voluntary sector. But it is not clear who will lead. The government's duties fall between the Home Office and the ministers of justice, education, communities and social exclusion. This division of labour must not undermine implementation. An energetic, imaginative minister leading a cross-departmental team is crucial to successful delivery. The response must recognise the community crime prevention work of programmes such as X-it and Kids Company. These organisations survive on budgets that are as uncertain as they are inadequate, while vast sums are spent on the penal system. It costs \u00a3100,000 to put a teenager through a week-long criminal trial, and \u00a3175,000 to imprison them for a year. We must now reverse the trend of under-resourcing valuable prevention programmes while wasting millions in futile punishment. Gordon Brown's response in this regard will truly test his commitment to break from the expensive failures of the Blair era. Implementation must involve people from all communities, but most crucially those with African Caribbean backgrounds. This report highlights past failures. We must now openly and honestly address the role of fathers in children's lives and our support for teachers who help shape their future. We need to learn to engage our children as young citizens. We must pressure the government into action, but also ensure that our youth make the most of every opportunity. Only then will the cycle of exclusion, victimisation, criminalisation and disaffection be broken. These recommendations offer hope to all young Britons on the route to a positive future. We must stop the drift towards a \"law and order society\" and steer a new course to social justice. \u00b7 Ben Bowling is associate head of King's College London School of Law and is a specialist adviser to the House of Commons home affairs committee \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.
