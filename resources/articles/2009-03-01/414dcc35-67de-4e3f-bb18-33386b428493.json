It is deja vu for the firm, whose shareholders are due to meet later this month to approve an \u00a384.3m bid from Square Enix, best known for its Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy role-playing games. The delay of Championship Manager in October 2004, in a move that saw the title miss out on the crucial Christmas market, sent the company into a spiral that ultimately led to a buyout by its rival SCi Entertainment. The company subsequently changed its name back to Eidos but it has been dogged by profit warnings and, more recently, an admission that the attractions of archaeologist Lara Croft had worn off. Sales of the latest instalment of her adventures \u2013 Tomb Raider: Underworld \u2013 failed to live up to expectations, wiping \u00a320m off projected sales. Today the company admitted that it had delayed the release of Championship Manager from April 2009 \"to ensure we deliver the best game to our customers\". \"As a result, the release date will move into the company's next financial year\", which starts on July 1. The company said the move would have \"limited impact\" on its profits. \"We believe by moving the release date of Championship Manager we will give the product the additional time needed to deliver a more polished and highly competitive game within the genre,\" said the chief executive, Phil Rogers. \"We will not compromise on quality and we are confident that this decision is right for consumers and will benefit the continued popularity of this franchise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
