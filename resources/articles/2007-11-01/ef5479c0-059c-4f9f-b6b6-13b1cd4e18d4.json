There's a drab sign nailed haphazardly to the outside of the warehouse that tells me I've arrived, but I'm not convinced. In the snowy, November half-light, Stockholm tends to come in various shades of grey at the best of times, but this particular neighbourhood is bleaker than most. After a minute or so dithering outside, I try the only entrance I can see - a metal door that looks like a fire-escape - and head up a bare, narrow staircase that leads on to a bare, narrow corridor. Halfway along there's a small desk where a receptionist confirms I am indeed in the right place. To call Stockholm's Praktiska Gymnasium basic hardly covers it. Even the most rundown inner-city English comprehensive usually makes some effort to tart itself up, but this Swedish upper secondary school has made almost none. Classrooms and workshops are spread out across several industrial buildings, and facilities are thin on the ground. It feels like a huge culture shock, but it's trivial compared to the seismic differences in store. The Praktiska Gymnasium is not an under-funded state school that's dying on its feet; it's a thriving, over-subscribed independent school that is only eight years old. And that's just for starters. Where British independent schools focus on the academic, this one caters exclusively for 16- to 18-year-olds training to become mechanics, locksmiths and electricians, and no one - not even those who don't complete all their qualifications - fails to get a job on leaving. Not that this is the creme de la creme of vocational education. Only a handful of the 127 students will go on to university, and 30% have special needs. Which begs the all-important question: how on earth do they afford the fees that can top \u00a310,000 a year? Quite simply, they don't. The state does. And that goes for any other independent school, too. And if you find that concept odd, then you might just have to get used to it. For a number of UK educationalists at the Adam Smith Institute are now suggesting that the Swedish system might be the model that saves our own. Casting an envious glance at other countries' education systems is nothing new - especially at a time when there is growing scepticism that the many billions of pounds pumped into schools since Labour came into power in 1987 still hasn't built the promised new Jerusalem. New York small schools are currently flavour of the month in some circles, and Finland has always been held up as the gold standard. Even by the Swedes. \"Finnish schools do outperform ours,\" admits Stefan Skimutis, director of education for Skolverket, the Swedish National Agency for Education, before adding triumphantly, \"but new research does suggest that our students are much happier than theirs.\" Compulsory education starts at seven - though almost all parents send their kids to kindergarten or make other childcare provision before that age - and runs through to 16. There are no standard schools. Some take students the whole way through their compulsory education, others for only a part of it. Neither is there a fixed syllabus or curriculum; instead, the state sets out various goals in 19 different subjects that students are expected to reach within a fixed number of hours and it's up to each school how they go about teaching the material. During the course of this nine-year schooling, pupils pick up credits for what they have achieved and, provided they have reached minimum targets in Swedish, English and maths, they are allowed to move on to upper secondary school to study one of 17 different programmes, ranging from construction, industry and food to arts, social science and technology. There is far less snobbery attached to the difference between the academic and the vocational than elsewhere. Indeed, construction tends to get more applications than almost any other programme because students are all but guaranteed a well-paid job at the end. The 10% of students who don't have the necessary grades are eligible for a one-year individual programme to get their marks up to scratch, and can then start one of the normal programmes a year late. It's a classic model of child-centred learning and it clearly works; more than 90% of students remain in full-time education until 19 and roughly 47% go on to university. Yet while these are statistics that Ed Balls, secretary of state for children, schools and families, can only dream about, the main reason Sweden has come to people's notice is the way it's funded. Each student comes with his or her own price tag and the state - or rather the municipality (ie the local education authority) has to pay. Within a few practical parameters, students may choose which school they want to go to and what programme they want to study, and the municipality has to oblige. \"A student is guaranteed a place at the nearest school,\" says Skimutis, \"as there is no such thing as a full school. If a school doesn't have enough places for all its applicants then it just has to take on bigger premises.\" And if parents don't like their local school they can apply to ones that are further away - though they will have to meet the child's transportation costs. And if they really don't like anything on offer from the state, they can send their child to an independent school. Or even start one up themselves. And it is this that has skewed the system. When the new funding model was introduced in 1994, the idea was to rebalance the system by opening up competition and choice. Schools that were oversubscribed must be doing something right, so they were free to expand; those that found they were losing numbers had to sharpen up or shrink. What no one anticipated, though, was just how much competition there would be. Thirteen years ago, independent schools were rare. Now they are everywhere. In Stockholm, there are 29 municipal higher secondary schools and 54 independents, and while the ratio isn't quite what it may seem as the independents tend to be a lot smaller, nearly half the city's 16- to 19-year-olds are educated in private schools. And the percentage is growing year on year as more and more independent schools open. \"No one ever anticipated this growth,\" says Helena Barrett, marketing coordinator for Stockholm's municipal schools, \"and it has created problems. There's fierce competition to attract students, with some offering incentives such as free laptops, and many people are concerned about the ethics of this and about spending so much money in this way. \"The competition between the municipal compulsory schools and the independents is less severe as there are fewer private secondary schools, but it is growing. And when it happens it can be devastating, because there is a far greater overlap in what they offer. While the independent upper secondaries tend to concentrate on a small number of programmes, the independent secondaries follow a broadly similar syllabus to the municipal schools. So, if either a group of parents or a business consortium wants to open a new independent school, they can take a huge number of potential students away from the local municipal schools.\" Which makes any kind of financial planning a total nightmare, as no school can be sure exactly how many students it's going to get from year to year. Predictably, the biggest burden tends to land on the municipal schools, partly because they have to pick up the pieces if anything goes wrong. \"There is a growing number of independent schools that have been forced to close,\" says Skimutis, \"and when this happens the municipal schools have to take their students.\" It's also been suggested that, even though the independent schools don't have the same class and money connotations as in the UK, they do try to help themselves to the most able students. There is already some evidence that wealthier parents are moving house to be close to better schools and that the majority of children with special needs, who are more expensive to educate, are going to the municipal schools. Inger Grape-Burns, principal of Stockholm's Praktiska Gymnasium, insists none of this applies to her school. \"We have a significant number of students with special needs,\" she says, \"and we allow the municipality to select our intake.\" She also isn't much bothered by concerns that the independent schools are profiting from state funds. \"We do make a profit,\" she admits, \"but it's not our driving motivation. Most money gets reinvested in the school and the surplus goes into a contingency fund in case students drop out and we lose our funding for them.\" But as the company that owns this school was able to open eight new schools last year, there's definitely decent money to be made. The Swedes may still be working out how to fine-tune their system, but Dr Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith Institute, is convinced they have it cracked. And as you would expect from one of the leading exponents of free-market economics, he bats aside criticism. \"It will be expensive and there will be adjustment costs,\" he says, \"but we're already wasting a fortune on a system that doesn't work. And the upside is that we'll create a system where the good schools are less regulated and are free to grow, while the failing ones will be forced to change or close. Of course, I wouldn't expect the present British independent schools to necessarily be part of the system as most operate on elitist principles; but I would hope to see a parallel group of independent schools, modelled on the Swedes, emerge.\" And who does he expect to get on side? \"I'm sure it's the sort of idea that will initially appeal to the Conservatives,\" he says. \"But then as the government seems to steal all the opposition's policies, it's probably no bad thing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
