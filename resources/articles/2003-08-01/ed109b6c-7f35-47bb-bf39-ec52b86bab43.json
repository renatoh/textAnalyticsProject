The station, which lies beneath a concrete shopping centre, is suffering from severe overcrowding, with complaints about its cramped concourse and lack of natural light. Rail bosses say it has too few platforms and is the worst congestion pinchpoint on the national rail network. It handles 1,300 trains a day, twice the design capacity of 650. To the dismay of business leaders and railway bosses, the transport secretary, Alistair Darling, has failed to commit funds to upgrade the station. The city council has accused him of showing a bias towards south-eastern transport projects at the expense of the Midlands. The authority has set up a working party with Network Rail and local businesses to investigate private financing. David Pywell, Birmingham city council's director of strategic development, said: \"There really is an issue with the welcome people get in that New Street clearly doesn't present a good image for the West Midlands or for Birmingham in particular.\" He said that just days after shelving a study backing a \u00a31.5bn redevelopment of the station last month, the government supported plans for the Crossrail east-west link across London. \"I do find it galling that we don't seem to be able to get the investment and then within days, the government announces it will support Crossrail,\" he said. New Street is at the crossroads of eight national railway lines. During the evening rush hour, congestion is so acute that local trains typically achieve reliability of just 30 to 40%. In an incident last November the station had to be closed, with train services suspended, because police feared that overcrowding was compromising safety. In a poll by BBC Radio 4's Today programme last year, New Street was voted the fifth worst horror of Britain, close behind the M25 and the Millennium Dome, while narrowly beating the Sellafield nuclear processing plant. A plan co-sponsored by the strategic rail authority (SRA) three years ago envisaged easing congestion by adding an extra track in each direction between Coventry and Wolverhampton. The strategy also proposed turning the station into a double decker, with some lines running to platforms at a lower level. The authority now says the scheme is \"not a priority\" because of a budget squeeze. Instead, it has suggested a cut-price \u00a3135m facelift by architect Will Alsop which would provide extra space by expanding the concourse and introducing an airport-style system in which passengers wait until they are \"called\" down to platforms. But it wants the money to be raised by the private sector. Rob Arnold, director general of Centro, the West Midlands passenger transport authority, said: \"London and the south-east don't seem to have a problem with the SRA - they're very focused on investment priorities in that part of the country.\" Local politicians say the area surrounding New Street has been improved in recent years, with underground walkways replaced by pedestrianised streets. A redeveloped shopping centre on the site of the unloved Bullring is expected to draw up to 60,000 people a day. But the station remains rooted in its 1960s design."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
