Romney's favorable numbers were in the can in the middle of the Republican nomination cycle, while Obama's approval ratings have also been underwhelming. It's reminded me of the 1992 campaign. To refresh your memory, Bill Clinton was relatively unpopular when he was in the middle of his primary fight against Jerry Brown and Paul Tsongas. His Gallup net favorable in the middle of April 1992 was a lackluster -12 percentage points. General election polling at that point in 1992 reflected Americans' general dislike of Clinton. He trailed President George HW Bush by around 10 points; he even fell to third place behind both Bush and independent Ross Perot by May. It seemed as though Democrats desperately needed a knight in shining armor. Democrats did, however, have one thing going for them. George Bush Sr's approval ratings were also subpar. For the months of April and May, his average Gallup approval rating was only 41%. A bad economy had taken its toll on the incumbent, who had been seemingly invincible after a successful Gulf war. Which would win out: Americans' lack faith in Bush's ability to do his job or Clinton's unlikability? Bush's approvals ended up not moving, while we all know that Clinton's favorability \u2013 and thus his standing against Bush \u2013 improved strongly after the Democratic convention. Bush is a prototype for what normally happens to incumbents. By the middle of election year, most incumbents' approval ratings are set. Going back to 1940, the median difference between the averages of April/May approval ratings and of the final approval ratings for an incumbent up for re-election is only 1.5 percentage points. Nine of the 12 incumbents saw their approval move no more than three points, which is well within a poll's margin of error. Growth or decline in the economy does not necessarily correlate with movement in an incumbent's approval rating. Job growth was quite strong in late 1940, 1964, and 1972, but the incumbent's approval did not move. Job growth was weak in late 1944 and 1956, but the incumbent's approval stayed at near-record high levels. Most of the big movers have qualitative explanations that we may not be able to plug into a model. Thus Truman's strong movement could be seen as merely a reversion to the mean. His approval rating was around 50% at the beginning of 1948, and it dropped tremendously by April despite net job, strong GDP, and net income growth. Johnson's sliding approval rating was a consequence of a natural and already occurring fading of the rally-around-the-leader effect following John F Kennedy's assassination. And then, Jimmy Carter's drop was the evaporation of the same rally-around-the-leader effect after the Iran hostage crisis. Before the hostages were taken in early November 1979, Carter's approval was in the low 30s. During the crisis itself, his approval spiked, but by the time it became clear his efforts to get the hostages released had failed, in mid June 1980, his approval had returned to its pre-crisis levels and stayed there through the election. So, the good news for incumbents is that approval ratings are pretty stable; the bad news is that they're also harder to move. Favorability numbers, on the other hand, are likely to be pretty mobile. As seen with Clinton, a high favorable at this point in the campaign doesn't mean a candidate will have one in November. Incumbent Carter's favorables recovered strongly in 1980; challenger Dukakis' dropped like a rock in 1988; and incumbent Bush's fell in 1992. (A note: because challengers are relatively unknown, a large section of the electorate will not have formed a view on them, so net favorables are used here to compensate for the large number of \"don't knows\". By their nature, net figures are likely to react more violently to changes in opinion than absolute favorable or unfavorable numbers on their own: net favorables change, in fact, at more than twice the rate of net approvals.) Which brings us back to the 2012. There seems to be little reason to expect Obama's numbers to move very much. Income growth has been pretty constant at zero. Job growth has been moderately up and down; incomes have been mostly steady; and GDP growth has also been up and down, by a few points of a percentage point. Most importantly, Obama's job approval ratings show no great trend over the last few months \u2013 see how flat these lines are: His overall job approval in the HuffPollster aggregate was 46.3%, while his disapproval percentage was 48.5% on 1 February. Today, his approval is slightly higher, at 46.7%; but his disapproval is up a tick to 48.7%. The numbers are slightly different in other averages, but they are all very marginal changes. Romney's favorables, on the other hand, have risen incrementally. The Real Clear Politics average has his favorable and unfavorable near even, with a net favorable of -2.2 percentage points. TPM now has his net favorable at 0.2 of a percentage point, after it had been at -16.5 points in February. HuffPollster is the most pessimistic at -8.8 net favorable (partially because it does not include a recent Gallup poll that has Romney's net favorable at +11); but even that is up from -14 in the middle of the primary season. We'll see Romney's favorables go up and down in the months to come, as they have recently, but that doesn't seem to be what's driving the polling data. Now the horse race is underway, Romney's favorability appears to be catching up to Obama's slightly, but he still stays in net negative net territory. Obama's lead in the polls over Romney has fallen from about 6 points in mid February to a small 2.5-point edge in the Real Clear Politics average; and in the TPM aggregate, Obama leads by just 0.7 of a point. Conversely, in the HuffPollster aggregate, Romney in fact leads by 0.7 of a percentage point. Perhaps most telling, Romney has a lead in an average of likely voter polls, as opposed to registered voters, of 0.8 points. Now, Obama's approval rating could certainly rise; it's not impossible to move the needle just a few points \u2013 it could be economic growth or some unforeseen political event. That said, his approval could also drop a few points for similar reasons. Approvals are not linked perfectly with general election results. If Romney's favorables, for whatever reason, stop improving, then Obama's approvals could probably just stay where they are \u2013 and the president's re-election prospects would still be competitive. That said, I'd be queasy if I were in the White House."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
