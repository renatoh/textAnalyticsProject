Facebook, Google and Amazon face increased scrutiny", "bodyText": "Congress is launching a bipartisan investigation into digital markets and the tech industry, looking into giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon for \u201ccompetition problems\u201d and \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d. \u201cThe open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\u201d the House judiciary chairman, Jerrold Nadler, said in a statement. \u201cBut there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.\u201d In addition to \u201cdocumenting competition problems\u201d and looking into \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d, the committee will assess \u201cwhether existing antitrust laws, competition policies and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues\u201d, lawmakers said in a joint statement. \u201cTechnology has become a crucial part of Americans\u2019 everyday lives,\u201d said Jim Sensenbrenner, antitrust subcommittee ranking member, in a statement. \u201cAs the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition.\u201d The announcement comes as US regulators, too, are moving to tighten scrutiny over the tech giants. Earlier on Monday, US tech stocks dropped after reports that US antitrust officials were preparing to investigate companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet. Under an agreement with the US justice department, officials from the Federal Trade Commission are reportedly preparing to investigate any practices at Facebook that may harm competition in the digital market. Separately, Reuters reported that the justice department had taken jurisdiction for a potential investigation of Apple, as part of a broader review of whether technology giants use their size to act in an anti-competitive manner. And last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice was looking into opening an anti-trust investigation into practices at Google. The power and control over the market that these tech companies hold has become a hot-button issue , with presidential hopefuls weighing in on the question of whether it is time to break up these companies in the way that the US government once broke up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies. The Democratic senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has long argued the tech companies should face more scrutiny. \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\u201d Warren said in a blogpost. \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\u201d \u201cI want a government that makes sure everybody \u2013 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2013 plays by the rules,\u201d she added. Senator Kamala Harris, a 2020 hopeful from California, where the tech industry has boomed, has expressed that she thinks \u201cwe have to seriously take a look\u201d at whether Facebook should be broken up. \u201cI think that Facebook has experienced massive growth and has prioritised its growth over the best interests of its consumers,\u201d Harris said, \u201cespecially on the issue of privacy. There is no question in my mind that there needs to be serious regulation, and that that has not been happening.\u201d Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, issued a more tempered statement advocating for \u201cstrong antitrust enforcement\u201d that will not hinder the promotion of \u201cinnovation and growth\u201d. \u201cThe House judiciary committee should hold tech accountable to strong antitrust enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut any investigation needs to be fact-based and lead to well-crafted regulatory outcomes. We should prevent anticompetitive platform privilege while promoting innovation and growth.\u201d Edward Helmore contributed reporting"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
