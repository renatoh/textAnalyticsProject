Enjoyable enough way to pass the time. The Cincinnati Kid (Norman Jewison, 1965) 3pm, Five The taut, atmospheric card-playing brother of Robert Rossen's 1961 pool movie, The Hustler. The game is stud poker, and Steve McQueen's Kid would be more than a match for that amateurish Bond in the new Casino Royale. Taking on The Man (Edward G Robinson) in a gruelling contest in a dour New Orleans, the Kid is as charismatic a brash young gambler as hustling Paul Newman. Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (Nicholas Meyer, 1982) 4.10pm, C4 A distinct improvement on the original big-screen version - Star Trek: The (Slow) Motion Picture. Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the Starship Enterprise are up against Ricardo Montalban's super-powered Khan, who is seeking vengeance after being cast away on a desert planet for 15 years. Spock's finest hour. The Sum Of All Fears (Phil Alden Robinson, 2002) 9pm, C4 This latest chapter in the life and adventures of novelist Tom Clancy's CIA-analyst hero Jack Ryan is a near-apocalyptic tale of international terrorism that takes in a nuclear attack on Baltimore. Ben Affleck as a fresher, younger version of Ryan is a bit lightweight compared to the Harrison Ford version in Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger, but it's a competently handled thriller. Sunday December 10 Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) 2.35pm, Five Hollywood's greatest doomed romance, played out in the dark days of the second world war. Grumpy Humphrey Bogart as Rick, tearful Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa, who left him at the station with a comical look on his face; and then, of all the gin-joints in the world, she walks into his. Aside from that sizzling pairing - and it's sobering to think it could have been Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan - it's hard to resist playing it again. Apollo 13 (Ron Howard, 1993) 2.35pm, ITV1 Houston, we have a problem... an understatement for the crew of Apollo 13 in 1970, when somewhere near the moon it lost power and the oxygen supply began leaking into the void. We know astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert got back to Earth; but there's still sweaty-palmed tension in how they did it. Starring Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Kevin Bacon. Men In Black II (Barry Sonnenfield, 2002) 7.25pm, Five It's the men in cool black suits against troublesome universe-conquering aliens again, with a few minor changes to freshen up the formula. No longer a rookie, Jay (Will Smith) has to inculcate former veteran but memory-wiped Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) in the arts of dealing with economic migrants/cheap crooks/megalomaniacs from other planets and employing a mind-boggling array of comic book weapons to do it. Fun for a bit, but hardly earth-shattering. Sweet Home Alabama (Andy Tennant, 2002) 8pm, BBC2 Reese Witherspoon almost makes this slushy, hackneyed romcom worth watching. She's a New York fashion designer who has forgotten her down-home-Alabamee roots - until she heads home to divorce her redneck childhood sweetheart Josh Lucas so she can marry city slicker Patrick Dempsey. Will immersion in those good ol' traditional values make her see the error of her ways? Forrest Gump (Robert Zemeckis, 1994) 9pm, C4 Oscar-strewn story of an all-American dope (a spectacularly blank-faced, monotone Tom Hanks) who trots from lowly origins through the staging posts of modern American history. Via special effects he meets JFK and Nixon; he fights in Vietnam, and yearns for his Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), but is basically a simple mama's boy (Mama being the excellent Sally Field). Touching, but it's hard to ignore its reactionary heart. Bad Boys II (Michael Bay, 2003) 9pm, Five Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as the odd-couple cops (Smith brash and violent, another over-the-top Bruckheimer action-manic production. Here the guys are up against a Cuban drug baron, and Gabrielle Union replaces Te\u00e1 Leoni as the unconvincing romantic interest. A couple of Bay's chase 'n' fight scenes are pretty thrilling. Cop Land (James Mangold, 1997) 10.55pm, BBC1 Garrison, New Jersey is a small town inhabited almost exclusively by New York cops, and for the gone-to-seed, heavily overweight sheriff Sylvester Stallone life is easy. But then a murder brings in Internal Affairs man Robert De Niro, who makes it clear that many of these cops have gone bad, Harvey Keitel's top dog in particular. Stallone takes his own sweet time deciding, like in the westerns, that a man's gotta do, etc, at which point Mangold's interesting script settles for routine heroics. Monday December 11 Arabesque (Stanley Donen, 1966) 1.30pm, C4 Typically flashy 1960s spy spree in which the leads handle all dangers with utter insouciance. Thus Gregory Peck's Oxford don is shaken out of musty academia into a world of nefarious Middle East villains seeking a secret hieroglyphic message - and only Sophia Loren for company. Blown Away (Stephen Hopkins, 1994) 9pm, Five An explosive time in Boston, Mass, where Tommy Lee Jones is a \"blaster\" too barmy even for the IRA, and going freelance: he reckons he's setting up a new state, \"called Chaos\". Luckily, bomb-disposal ace Jeff Bridges is on hand to defuse the situation. A traditional battle of wills, heavy on the pyrotechnics, and with Jeff's dad Lloyd playing his dad. Analyze That (Harold Ramis, 2002) 9pm, ITV1 Lame sequel to Ramis's box-office hit about the shrink and the mobster, Analyze This. Robert De Niro is back as wiseguy Paul Vitti, conning his way out of jail and into the care of nervy psychoanalyst Billy Crystal. It has its moments - Vitti advising on a Sopranos-style TV show is fun - but everyone's going through the motions. Face (Antonia Bird, 1997) 11.35pm, BBC1 This sort of hard-nut heist-gone-wrong movie is traditionally set in LA, but here a cold, dark, wintry London provides an extra frisson. Robert Carlyle is the crook hunting a traitor after the gang's loot is stolen, and there's a crunchy cast on hand - Ray Winstone, Philip Davis, Peter Vaughan, Sue Johnston and even Damon Albarn. Bird and Carlyle teamed up to visceral effect again for the wild west flesh-eating horror movie, Ravenous. Shyamol Chhaya (Humayun Ahmed, 2004) 1.55am, C4 Tuesday December 12 Duets (Bruce Paltrow, 2000) 12midnight, BBC1 A musical odyssey that follows three mismatched couples as they head for a karaoke contest in Omaha, Nebraska. The most interesting pair are Huey Lewis reuniting with his daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by her father, Bruce, her performance lacks tone, but there's nothing wrong with her singing voice. The Luzhin Defence (Marleen Gorris, 2000) 2.45am, C4 Lake Como, 1929: John Turturro's grandmaster Luzhin is contesting a world chess tournament. He makes fancy moves on the board but socially he's a klutz; and yet he is drawn to Emily Watson's Natalia, holidaying with her overbearing mother (Geraldine James). Adapted cleverly and movingly from a Nabokov novella, it's an absorbing portrait. Wednesday December 13 Enemy Of The State (Tony Scott, 1998) 9pm, Five A typically frantic Jerry Bruckheimer production that is basically an adrenalin-crazed reworking of The Conversation. Gene Hackman, star of the 1970s Coppola thriller, appears here too, as the veteran surveillance man winkled out of hiding to rescue Will Smith's innocent attorney from a murder rap concocted by government spooks. The Thomas Crown Affair (John McTiernan, 1999) 10.40pm, BBC1 A stylish, sexy and superior remake of Jewison's 1968 cat-and-mouse caper movie. Pierce Brosnan plays Crown, a billionaire and occasional art thief; Rene Russo is Catherine Banning, the insurance investigator who falls for her suspect, though the sex on the marble staircase looks (ouch) a little far-fetched. Thursday December 14 Secretary (Steven Shainberg, 2002) 10pm, C4 The sweetest tale of sadomasochism you're likely to see. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a troubled, self-harming young woman back in the community after a spell in care; she takes a job as secretary for one-man legal business James Spader, who proves to be a very strict boss indeed. A funny, tender and very peculiar romance. Friday December 15 Yangtse Incident (Michael Anderson, 1959) 1.50pm, C4 Director Anderson teams up again with his star of The Dam Busters, Richard Todd, in another tale of stiff-upper-lipped British heroism in time of conflict. It's 1949 and on a supply mission to Nanking the HMS Amethyst, a British cruiser, runs foul of Chinese communist forces. Can Todd save the ship, and the day? Blue Streak (Les Mayfield, 1999) 9pm, Five Martin Lawrence does his Eddie Murphy thing in this lively LA crime caper. Caught in the act of a diamond robbery, he hides the stolen gem on a construction site, returning after doing time only to find the place is now a police station. What can a good thief do, but pose as a newly transferred cop, blag his way inside, and locate the jewel? A funny, undemanding 90 minutes. The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) 10.55pm, Five Hard to resist Cameron's early science-fantasy classic, however often it shows: he squeezes every possible ounce of visceral action and special effects from the tricksy time-loop plot, tiny \u00a33.5m budget and a perfectly cast Arnold Schwarzenegger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
