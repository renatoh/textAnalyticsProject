Vardy replaced Marcus Rashford midway through the second half at the Johan Cruyff Arena and, despite the visitors dominating the contest en route to their 1-0 success, spent the entirety of his 20th cap harrying opponents or selflessly running the channels without ever contributing in possession. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened to me before, but I did do a lot of running,\u201d said the Leicester striker. \u201cI came on at a time when Holland were trying to get a goal back. As a striker you do sometimes have to sacrifice and we just want to make sure we attack as a team and defend as a team, so I had to help out the midfield as well.\u201d Gareth Southgate tweaked his team\u2019s formation for the game in the Netherlands on Friday evening and played two strikers, offering Vardy and Rashford some hope that they are not competing with Harry Kane for a solitary place in the team at the World Cup this summer. \u201cAbove all, it\u2019s encouraging for the entire team,\u201d added Vardy, who boasts seven goals from his last nine appearances at club level. \u201cGoing into tournaments you don\u2019t want to have just one plan. It gives us options and the performance we put in on Friday shows we can play different formations and we might have to use that in the World Cup. \u201cIt gives us all encouragement we can play those well. We\u2019re still progressing. We want to make sure that, as against the Dutch, we are solid. Keeping clean sheets is always good because, with the attackers we\u2019ve got, there are goals in the team to get us the victories. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful I\u2019ll have my chance to play from the start against Italy, but it\u2019s up to the boss what formation he plays and which players he wants to pick, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d Jack Butland is expected to start at Wembley despite Jordan Pickford\u2019s impressive contribution to the victory in Amsterdam, with the Tottenham Hotspur duo Eric Dier and Dele Alli also likely to begin against the Azzurri at Wembley. Jack Wilshere will miss out, but Joe Gomez will remain with Southgate\u2019s squad despite his early exit against Holland. The 20-year-old\u2019s replacement, Harry Maguire, was forced off late in the game but there are no major concerns over the Leicester defender."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
