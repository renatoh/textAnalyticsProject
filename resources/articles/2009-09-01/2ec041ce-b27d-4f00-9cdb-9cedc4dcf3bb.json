There appears to be a determination in the White House to make sure that Barack Obama's Prague speech adds up to more than lip service to the ideal of getting rid of nuclear weapons. As we're reporting in this morning's Guardian, the president has sent back the Pentagon's version of the Nuclear Posture Review on the grounds that it is too timid, and called for a more ambitious rethink of US nuclear doctrine. The White House also seems committed to making the current negotiations with Russia on a \"Start plus\" treaty the beginning rather than the end of a continuous process of bilateral disarmament. A serious barrier to further Russian disarmament below 1500 deployed strategic warheads has just been removed with the scrapping of the Bush missile defence scheme. In the best case scenario, the two countries could get their arsenals down to hundreds, rather than thousands, of warheads by the end of Obama's first term. At that point, the second tier nuclear powers - France, Britain and China - would join the negotiations. Meanwhile, according to this happy scenario, the new commitment to disarmament impresses the non weapons states so much they agree to strengthen the nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty at next May's review conference and sign up to measures that make proliferation much harder. The likes of Iran and North Korea are isolated, while India, Pakistan and Israel are drawn into the NPT, and start to abide by the rules. Nuclear arms gradually wither away. Or not. Obama's disarmament drive could falter before it really takes off. There is plenty of opposition in the Pentagon and Congress to the sort of deep cuts he is seeking, and a lot of vested interest, in the weapons labs and elsewhere, in keeping nuclear weapons projects going. It will not be easy to get the two-thirds Senate majority to ratify the long-delayed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Without that momentum, next year's NPT Review Conference could be a washout like 2005, and it is unclear how much more failure the non proliferation regime can stand. If Iran is still enriching uranium ever more efficiently next summer, there are a string of Arab states who will consider starting a programme of their own. An Israeli air strike on Iranian targets would almost certainly make matters worse, raising tensions and decreasing transparency. The number of weapons states, kept to single figures for so long, could jump dramatically in a generation. This blog will aim to keep up with developments day by day. It will focus mostly on nuclear issues, but there will be coverage too of the war in Afghanistan, the internal threats to Pakistan, the evolution of Nato, counter-terrorism, and other bits and pieces as long as they can reasonably be said to involve global security. Let me know what we are doing wrong or right, and what we are missing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
