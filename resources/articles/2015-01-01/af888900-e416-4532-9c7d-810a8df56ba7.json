Gomis moved to the Liberty Stadium on a free transfer from Lyon last summer under the Bosman ruling, and the player is due a payment of around \u00a38m to be met over the duration of his four-year deal. The 29-year-old would be due that figure regardless of whether he leaves the club this month, effectively meaning Swansea would seek in excess of that amount to ensure they made a profit on his sale. It is unclear whether the same commitment would be due if Gomis formally requests a transfer. The France international has played second fiddle to Wilfried Bony, scoring four goals in 23 appearances mainly from the bench, since moving to the Premier League and suggested in an interview with Canal Plus on Sunday that he felt let down by that bit-part role and would be keen to move despite the Ivorian\u2019s recent sale to Manchester City. Gomis earns around \u00a355,000 a week at Swansea, which fits within their wage structure but equates to more given the staggered nature of the hefty signing-on fee. Palace are willing to spend heavily in this window to sign a striker they believe can secure top-flight status, though whether they would meet that sizeable fee and pay the player the \u00a370,000 a week remains to be seen. They have secured Arsenal\u2019s Yaya Sanogo on loan for the rest of the season and are exploring various options to strengthen further. They have formalised their interest in the Blackburn Rovers forward Rudy Gestede and have also scouted Fiorentina\u2019s Khouma Babacar, who has interested Tottenham Hotspur but is understood to be in talks over a new deal with the Viola. Yet Gomis would represent their first-choice option if a deal could be struck. Palace are encouraged by the Frenchman\u2019s public suggestion that he is unsettled. The player\u2019s agent intends to speak to Swansea this week to discuss the forward\u2019s future. \u201cThen I will have a discussion with my representatives to find the best solution,\u201d Gomis told Canal Plus. \u201cI need time to reflect because what was said was not respected. At my age it is difficult to spend my time sitting on the bench.\u201d Palace, who have recruited Ben Stevens from Newcastle as an analyst to rejoin Alan Pardew at Selhurst Park, also intend to lodge an improved bid for Swansea\u2019s left-back Neil Taylor. An offer for Taylor of around \u00a33m was rejected last week but Palace\u2019s hopes of securing a deal for the 25-year-old appear to have been bolstered by Swansea\u2019s move for Martin Olsson at Norwich. The Championship club are considering a \u00a34m bid lodged over the weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
