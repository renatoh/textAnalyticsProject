For most of that time, Stevenson eschewed the limelight. \u201cFor years I was one of these people \u2013 I just wanted to put my head down and do my work. I didn\u2019t even have a sign on the door,\u201d he says. Recently though, he\u2019s been more visible. First there was a Ted talk \u2013 one of the most widely circulated ever. Then a book. Then Stevenson took the helm as the director and public face of a narrative museum and monument to lynching in his adopted city of Montgomery. Stevenson\u2019s reluctant journey into public figurehood will probably reach its final form in the next year, as the subject of the HBO documentary True Justice, and as the inspiration for the feature film Just Mercy starring Michael B Jordan, which is scheduled for release in 2020. In large part that\u2019s because he\u2019s come to embrace an audacious idea that, if he\u2019s ever going to get off the ground, he\u2019s going to have to be heard. Today Stevenson is aiming for nothing less than an American era of truth and reconciliation on race, especially as it relates to inequality in the criminal justice system. \u201cThings I would have said \u2018absolutely not\u2019 to 10 years ago, I\u2019m now much more open to \u2013 mostly as a medium for getting people to see the system and the way it functions more clearly,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cThe power of film for me is that it can have a shelf-life and an audience that goes far beyond that of a news story.\u201d He points, as an example, to the way the new Netflix miniseries When They See Us, which dramatizes the story of the Central Park Five, has reignited discussion about wrongful conviction. Just Mercy, which also stars Jamie Foxx as one of Stevenson\u2019s first clients, will mostly address that system on a more individual scale. It tells the story of Walter McMillian, a black Alabaman sentenced to death for the 1986 murder of an 18-year-old white woman on shockingly flimsy evidence. Stevenson won his exoneration in 1993. True Justice, meanwhile, walks through the view of American racism and criminal justice from 30,000ft up, while also taking viewers along a tour of Stevenson\u2019s life. The basic trajectory of the former will be familiar to readers of Michelle Alexander\u2019s 2010 book The New Jim Crow, or viewers of Ava DuVernay\u2019s 2016 Netflix documentary The Thirteenth. Stevenson adeptly argues that there is an unbroken chain of brutality in American law and society from chattel slavery to the current era of mass incarceration, in which more than 2 million Americans, disproportionately black, are incarcerated at any given moment. This chain runs through the white supremacist terrorism of lynching after the fall of post-civil war Reconstruction, and through the black codes and convict leasing \u2013 where black Americans were charged with imaginary crimes like vagrancy, convicted in kangaroo courts, and for their sentence were rented out as free labor. The latest chapter was the era of the so-called war on drugs and \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d prosecution, in which large numbers of poor black and brown Americans were subject to draconian law enforcement and locked away on long mandatory sentences. That\u2019s the phenomenon people like Stevenson are working to unwind. \u201cWe have to get the country to confront the fact that we acted out of fear and anger, we did some horrible things. And now we have to recover, we have to repair the damage that we did,\u201d he says. Stevenson brings an air of earnest optimism to that idea. \u201cI think if most people saw what I see on a daily basis when I go into jails or prisons, if they were in the room and trying to respond to children who have been put in adult facilities, I don\u2019t think they would think differently than I do,\u201d he says. He really believes in reconciliation, but as he\u2019s fond of saying, you need to have the truth part first. Part of that truth lies simply in making sure people can see it, which undergirds the openness to film as a medium of the message. He says: \u201cWe have just allowed too many people in this country to be insulated from the pain, anguish and inequality that\u2019s created by mass incarceration. We have allowed too many people to be untouched by the burdens created by police. And when you break down those barriers, I think people are going to want to respond.\u201d In the film, Stevenson\u2019s brother Howard explains how he and his wife named their first son after Bryan \u2013 in part because they concluded he may not have time for family. He never married and has no children. \u201cBryan is the work,\u201d colleague Sia Sanneh adds. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to separate him from the work. It\u2019s his full self he pours into it.\u201d That fact appears to remain as true as ever. He\u2019s writing a second book. The EJI space in Montgomery has opened a new event space hosting lessons for schoolchildren and community discussions. And Stevenson hasn\u2019t left the courtroom either. He\u2019s planning new litigation aimed at relief for some of the most vulnerable people inside US jails and prisons. \u201cI really want to challenge the way we treat people with disabilities in our jails and prisons,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really cruel to people who are mentally ill, and so we\u2019re gonna be making a big push around that issue.\u201d True Justice: Bryan Stevenson\u2019s Fight for Equality, premieres on HBO on 26 June with a UK date yet to be announced"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
