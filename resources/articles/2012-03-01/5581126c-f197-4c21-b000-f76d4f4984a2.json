England's cricketers usually seem uneasy in Sri Lanka \u2013 nothing to do with the heavily oppressive domestic politics, but more with the steam-bath heat, the turning pitches, and the home side's ever rigorous competitiveness. The two\u2011Test series that begins on Monday marks the 30th anniversary of Sri Lanka's inaugural one-off Test match in Colombo in which the wide-eyed debutants gave Keith Fletcher's England a nasty fright for the first three days \u2013 play on the fourth morning began with Sri Lanka 160 ahead with seven second-innings wickets standing before a rousing fingers-out Agincourt speech by the vice-captain, Bob Willis, inspired six wickets in eight overs by off-spinner John Emburey, followed by a resolute winning innings by Chris Tavar\u00e9 that carried the day. Sri Lanka's Test match baptism at the end of February 1982 had rounded off England's four-month tour of India in which, after the home side's initial win, the next five Tests were ploddingly drawn. So it was at least refreshing for England to arrive for the final unstressed fortnight in a welcoming Sri Lanka palpably delighted at its cricketing coming of age. My goodness, Willis and I at once discovered a bar that sold ice-cold draught Guinness. That always spick and span stumper Bob Taylor was entranced, I remember, to find a store that actually sold his favourite Tabac aftershave lotion. A rich tea-planter took a few of us, including the crack-shot countrymen Ian Botham and Fletcher, up into the cooler hills for a day of rough shooting. The Essex yeoman had played in Colombo years before, when it was the capital of Ceylon, and for him this festive fortnight was irritatingly full of no end of official speech-making \u2013 and he regularly had his team and us pressmen giggling into our handkerchiefs for Keith could never stop himself calling it, not Sri Lanka, but Sri-lon as in: \"'ow 'appy we are to be Sri\u2011lon.\" Swi-lon, for lisping Fletch also had trouble with his r's \u2013 in spite of the fact that he named his two daughters Tara and Sara. I advised him to let history guide his oratory \u2013 for that first official Test coincided with the precise centenary of the first landing of cricketers on the island when the Hon Ivo Bligh's men, en route for Australia, played a one-dayer against 18 of Colombo's garrison regiment, the Dublin Fusiliers, after their steamer Glenroy put in for repairs. Four years later Arthur Shrewsbury's side made a refuelling stop, enjoyed some net practice, and Lancashire's stonewaller Richard Barlow (of poetry fame) noted in his journal: \"We had a good look around and had some fine fun with the darkies.\" In 1891 WG Grace's men changed boats at Colombo, from the P &amp; O's grand Mirzapore to the more modest steamer Nubia for the journey on to Melbourne, and found time for a knockabout, after which the Doc noted in his diary: \"October 27. Whistle-stop match. I hit wicket 14.\" By a century ago, the game had already taken a firm grip: in 1911 8,000 turned up to see Jack Hobbs when Pelham Warner's team passed through on the Orvieto. The Ceylon Observer remarked: \"Hobbs made 45 including a sixer; he was full of splendour, but very flashy.\" The paper went on: \"The English men totalled 213, then took a prolonged luncheon at Prince's of at least one and a half hours during which time the spectators became very restless.\" They returned to bowl out 20 locals for 59 by tea-time.\" The extant scorebook still logs: \"Umpire was Mr Polly, ship's passenger.\" The first Test of the 2012 tour is at Galle. That's where Douglas Jardine's MCC team notoriously played its 1934 one-dayer against all-Ceylon. Cars and potholes had also arrived on the island by then and the team had to travel 75 miles down the coast road from Colombo in half a dozen taxis. But only three had turned up in time for the 11 o'clock start and the captain's car was one of those severely punctured. It carried no spare tyres so the game did not start until after 1pm when a thoroughly furious Jardine had finally made it. The crowd was again, to say the least, \"restless\". A couple of rowdies apparently tore the MCC flag from the pavilion flagpole, and when Jardine went out to bat in his Harlequin cap, a noisy throng barracked the Wykehamist patrician unmercifully. In his tour report to Lord's Jardine dismissed the incident sneeringly: \"Simply, some lunatics from the nearby asylum had been let out to witness proceedings.\" But he never captained England again; nor even Surrey. Mind you, in terms of an Englishman's olde-tyme sport, Jardine certainly upstaged us lot of Fletcher's in 1982. Our day of rough shooting up in the cool of the hills around Kandy had produced a few bags of partridge and, I seem to remember, a handful of hares. Ah, innocence \u2013 at least compared with Jardine's 1934 slaughter. On that tour of the subcontinent, on a dozen shoots, Jardine's diary logged one elephant and \"personally, one lion, one panther, one tiger, one bear, three crocodiles and numerous stags\", to which list he adds a nice sadist's PS: \"plus countless snakes and innumerable smaller creatures.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
