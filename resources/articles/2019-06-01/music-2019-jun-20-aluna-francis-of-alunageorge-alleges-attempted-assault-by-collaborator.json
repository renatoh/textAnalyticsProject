In an episode of BBC podcast the Next Episode that focuses on #MeToo and the music industry, Francis alleged that the man offered to let her charge her phone in his hotel room after they had been working on a song. When she accepted, she said he became \u201ca completely different person \u2013 his behaviour went from nought to 100\u201d. Francis said that after the man tried to force his hands into her underwear, \u201che pinned me down and he\u2019d taken his trousers down and he was trying to put his dick in my mouth. So I wrestled him off, and he was still laughing cause he thought it was a game and that I was having a really fun time having a pretend rape situation.\u201d Francis escaped from the room, and told the BBC: \u201cYou would think that I understood how wrong this was straight away and I didn\u2019t. Musicians are crazy ambitious about getting their craft out there. And that\u2019s why I think there\u2019s so much shame about these kind of situations: Am I that stupid? What is wrong with me? Why have I compartmentalised all of this just for my career? That\u2019s madness.\u201d She said she returned to the studio with the man and spoke to him about his behaviour. \u201cHe did all his apologies and talked about how he was so incredibly sorry and [that] this has never happened before,\u201d she said, adding that she did not consider reporting the alleged incident to police. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with it all the time. Even if it goes up to a high level, you\u2019re still playing out this role of \u2018It\u2019s fine\u2019.\u201d She said she was \u201cso scared\u201d to tell her story. Francis formed AlunaGeorge with Reid in 2012. The following year they released their debut album, Body Music.
