Before Meng was formally arrested on 1 December, she was questioned for nearly three hours by Canadian border agents. She was also asked to surrender her electronic devices, which border agents searched. By leading her to believe her detention and questioning were immigration-related \u2013 and not the result of a US arrest warrant \u2013 police in effect violated her rights under Canada\u2019s charter, her legal team said in court filings. \u201cThere [was] nothing routine about this,\u201d Meng\u2019s lawyer, Richard Peck, told the court, accusing the government of engaging in a \u201ccovert criminal investigation\u201d under the pretext of immigration issues. Canada\u2019s attorney general has defended law enforcement\u2019s handling of the case, telling the court that an arrest warrant can be executed after a person has passed through customs \u2013 as was the case with Meng. The government also argued that the sharing of information between border security agents and the FBI, while Meng was still being questioned, was lawful. \u201cThere is no evidence that the conduct of officials, either Canadian or foreign, has compromised the fairness of the extradition proceedings,\u201d said the government in a court filing. Meng\u2019s legal team are demanding the release of additional documentation, which they believe supports the claim her arrest was constitutionally problematic. Government lawyers have rejected the request, telling the court they have already provided the defence with handwritten notes from police and border officers, as well as video footage from the airport. Any requests for additional information were merely a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d by the defence, they said. \u201cNo purpose would be served in providing further disclosure,\u201d the attorney general said in court filings. The strategy to fight her arrest on constitutional grounds is separate from the broader extradition fight, which is scheduled to begin on 20 January. For months, Meng has been fighting extradition to the United States, where she faces fraud charges. American officials allege she misled bankers about her company\u2019s dealings in Iran. If Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia supreme court sides with Meng in this particular case, the extradition proceedings against her would probably have to be thrown out \u2013 avoiding what many experts believe will be a costly, multi-year legal fight. In addition to souring relations between the United States and China, Meng\u2019s arrest has also significantly damaged the relationship between Canada and China. Once close to signing a free trade deal, China has since detained two Canadians \u2013 Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor \u2013 on espionage charges and halted canola and pork imports from Canada."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
