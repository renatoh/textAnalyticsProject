It was their first of the new season and, to be brutally honest, it was a bit of a non-event. In fact the only reason for mentioning the moment when S\u00e9bastien Haller briefly stirred Ederson with a tame overhead kick is that West Ham would not be allowed another sight of goal until deep into the second half, by which point City were cruising towards yet another romp at the London Stadium. Unfortunately this has become the norm when mid-table hopefuls come up against opponents as classy and streetwise as the reigning champions. Did West Ham play well in that curiously low-key first half? They did have their flashes. Their high press forced a couple of sloppy errors from City. Haller, Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s new \u00a345m striker, had some cute touches and brought teammates into play. Felipe Anderson left Oleksandr Zinchenko on his backside at one point. Manuel Lanzini appealed for a penalty after tumbling in City\u2019s area. There were moments. \u201cI think we stuck to the plan quite well in the first half,\u201d Jack Wilshere said. \u201cWe were unlucky to go in 1-0 down. I wouldn\u2019t say we created a lot of chances but we were comfortable.\u201d And there was the rub. West Ham might have felt comfortable during the opening period but they trailed after an instinctive strike from Gabriel Jesus in the 25th minute and barely landed a meaningful blow on City in the final third. This is what the champions do to the also-rans. For all the focus on the creativity and flair, there is an edge to them out of possession, a structure that makes it hard to get at their defence and a willingness to let eager opponents tire themselves out. City\u2019s back four welcomed the pressure from West Ham\u2019s forwards. The more it happened the more Rodri, a brawny but elegant presence in defensive midfield, dropped back to take the ball. Ederson in goal was capable of starting moves from his six-yard box. Slowly but surely West Ham were pulled into the trap and space opened up for Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Riyad Mahrez, while Michail Antonio\u2019s failure to protect Aaron Cresswell allowed Kyle Walker to raid down the right and create the opener for Jesus. West Ham tried to persist with their plan. Yet they had no counter to City\u2019s cynical ability to prevent their moves from developing with tugs of the shirt. As Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r noted last season, Guardiola teams are experts at the tactical foul and referees rarely punish a seemingly innocuous ruse. \u201cThat\u2019s football,\u201d Wilshere said. \u201cWhen you play against experienced players who understand the game it\u2019s going to happen. You can\u2019t get frustrated. They\u2019re clever players. A team like us who like to attack could learn from that. They do that counter press. They lose the ball and bang, they go straight away. They\u2019re going to make fouls. If you do get out of it, it happens so quickly and they bring you down.\u201d Wilshere went off with a dead leg after receiving some rough treatment from Rodri, who made an assured competitive debut after his move from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \u201cHe seems to know what the Premier League is about already,\u201d the West Ham midfielder said. City, who delivered the perfect riposte to Liverpool\u2019s 4-1 win over Norwich City on Friday night, feel they have found a long-term replacement for Fernandinho. Yet it is a collective effort. They have all been drilled to hunt the ball with ferocious intensity. \u201cYou can see that from the way Pep is on the sidelines,\u201d Wilshere said. \u201cHe\u2019s animated and you can tell when you\u2019re lining up against them in the tunnel that they\u2019re up for it. They\u2019re the best in the league at keeping the ball but they also know you have to put your foot in.\u201d It was a masterclass in earning the right to play from City, who spent the second half embarrassing West Ham\u2019s lightweight midfield. De Bruyne charged through the middle to make Raheem Sterling\u2019s first goal and the England forward opened the campaign with a hat-trick after two more delightful finishes. \u201cHe\u2019s a nightmare to play against,\u201d Wilshere said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to come inside and he\u2019s so sharp off the mark. He\u2019s playing in a great team but he\u2019s arguably their key player. He\u2019s probably the first name on the teamsheet for Pep.\u201d Sterling\u2019s indispensable status speaks volumes given that Sergio Ag\u00fcero came off the bench to underline City\u2019s strength in depth with a late penalty. It is difficult to pinpoint flaws in this side, which might come as some consolation for West Ham. They will not be the last to end up wondering if they were ever in the game against Guardiola\u2019s genius workaholics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
