Like anyone in the sport Ari Vatanen has strong views on the verdict and what it says about Formula One and those who run it. But unlike most, the former world rally champion and MEP could soon be in a position to do something about it. Four weeks today he will take on Mosley's favoured candidate, Jean Todt, who presided over Ferrari's most successful period between 2000 and 2004, as the FIA's 122-member associations cast their votes. If Vatanen is running on a change ticket, Todt is the continuity candidate. Vatanen casts himself as the white knight who can cleanse Formula One's blackened soul: \"People are looking for that vacuum to be filled \u2013 a lack of integrity, a lack of democracy and a lack of normal functioning,\" he says. On Crashgate, Vatanen thinks Nelson Piquet Jr should have been punished too and that a lifetime ban for Flavio Briatore seems \"very harsh\". But, like others in the sport, his main concern is not with the outcome but the process. \"It is not done by independent justice, that is the bottom line.\" The election was sparked earlier this season when the teams forced Mosley to promise he would step down in return for dropping plans for a breakaway series. Vatanen has been outspoken in his criticism of the fact that Todt has received the endorsement of Mosley and that Richard Woods, the FIA's spin doctor, has stepped down from his post to run the former Ferrari chief's campaign. With four weeks to go until the 23 October election, the lobbying will intensify this weekend in Singapore where Todt, who has maintained a low profile, is set to meet the Formula One Teams' Association. Mosley raised the stakes this week when he said of Vatanen: \"You've no experience, you've never run anything, you've never been in charge of even the smallest organisation, you have no concept of what it is like. You didn't even run your own rally car, you had a co-driver to do that, so I cannot support you.\" Vatanen responds carefully: \"Over a long period of time in any organisation, if it hasn't upheld checks and balances, it inevitably moulds around the leader and the values of the leader.\" He claims the FIA might split in two if he does not win with some of the biggest clubs including the Automobile Association of America, a strong critic of Mosley, breaking away in frustration. \"When the big clubs go away, they go away. It will be a real pity if the FIA break into two. Max is playing with fire. Is that the legacy he wants to leave?\" Vatanen also claims that Formula One is in danger, with the fractured relationship between the teams and the governing body leaving sponsors and manufacturers unable to take long-term investment decisions. \"The sport is suffering and it is not developing. Who can give Formula One a clean bill of health? Nobody. Whether it's Bernie or anyone else, there must be even powers around the table. There must be a revolution. There is more at stake than people realise.\" He bemoans the lack of any long-term strategy for the sport or the organisation that governs it. \"Have you ever seen a strategy for Formula One for the next 10 to 15 years? The strategy for the World Rally Championship for the next 10 to 15 years? The strategy for the FIA in a fast-moving and evolving world for the next 10 years? I don't seem to have seen these papers.\" The Finn, en route to the airport to collect his son before heading to Singapore and then on to a campaign trail that takes in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, has presented himself as the reforming candidate that can save Formula One from itself. \"It is an incredibly powerful and brilliant piece of sport and entertainment. But it still plays with the rules. Some are granted rights and some are on the receiving end. Obviously it can't continue like that,\" he says. \"If our sport does well, then everyone will do well - television rights, owners, promoters, FOTA. If it is run in a healthy manner then maybe the ordinary family father with three kids can afford to pay for the tickets.\" In another less than veiled dig at Mosley, he says that he will not use his power for \"personal interest\" but for the greater good. With an eye on the member associations that will decide his fate, he is also keen to emphasise the Paris-based organisation's broader role. \"Formula One is only 20 people. We have got 100m motorists throughout the world and hundreds of millions to come. Think about this incredible FIA family. We are united by the passion of automobiles, whether it's old or fast, big or small. We are united by the passion,\" he says. \"It is the same attitude I have brought to everything. I brake late \u2013 that leaves no time for opportunism and cynical political calculations.\" Many in the sport assume Todt will prevail, given the influence wielded by Mosley and Ecclestone and their ability to bend events to their will, but Vatanen says he is supremely confident as the list of member associations who say they will back him grows. \"Now the majority is coming to realise it can be done. Look at slavery or anything else. I'm not comparing this to slavery, not at all,\" he says. \"But it always starts with a few individuals and we all have a judgment of what is right and what is wrong. But if you feel totally powerless and that if you raise your head it is taken off... Now people see that a critical mass is gathering.\" If votes were awarded for stirring rhetoric, the Finn would surely be home and dry. \"It is like any other election campaign where people simply want to be liberated from the iron gates of the past. The tide has turned. All of Max's troops are mobilised, he is contacting everyone and flying here, there and everywhere. That will work in our favour because you can't swim against the current and the current is with us now.\" But as numerous opponents of Mosley have found over the years to their cost, in Formula One it is rarely that simple. Who is the man who would be king? Born 27 April 1952 in Tuupovaara, eastern Finland Rallying career Vatanen makes professional debut in 1970, graduating to the World Rally Championship in 1974. Secures debut win at the 1980 Acropolis Rally, before becoming the World Rally champion in 1981.
