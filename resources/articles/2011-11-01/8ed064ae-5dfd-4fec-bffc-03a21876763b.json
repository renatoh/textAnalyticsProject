This week's question We live in a new-build four-bed townhouse with integral garage. We want to convert the garage into a second living room/playroom. Will it add value \u2013 or do the opposite? We have a drive big enough for one car. Will buyers be put off by the absence of a garage, or will the extra room be more, or at least equally, attractive?
