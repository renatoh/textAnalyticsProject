Aaron Ramsey will miss that game having been sent off for two second-half yellow cards, for soft fouls on Necip Uysal and Oguzhan Ozyakup. Wenger was bemused about how Demba Ba escaped sanction for a tackle on Mikel Arteta that left the Spaniard limping out of the game. The captain is now doubtful for Saturday\u2019s trip to Everton and Arsenal are hoping their trio of returning Germany World Cup winners, Mesut \u00d6zil, Per Mertesacker and LukasPodolski, will be fit to feature at Goodison Park. While the bottle flung at Wenger \u2013 it missed \u2013 drew the post-match focus, it was Milorad Mazic\u2019s display which provoked criticism. \u201cNeither the first nor the second yellow card was deserved [for Ramsey],\u201d said the Arsenal manager. \u201cWhen you see some of the fouls made tonight and we go home with Ramsey red-carded, it\u2019s a bit unbelievable. The challenge on Arteta was very bad but the referee was on the pitch and didn\u2019t see anything of it. It\u2019s very difficult to understand but, in the second half, the performance of the referee was very bad. \u201cWe had Ramsey\u2019s second card \u2026 it was wrong and it was a huge decision. I felt just a lot was wrong in the second half but, overall, perhaps it was a difficult game maybe to referee as well. Everybody did fight for every ball. Maybe it was not easy for the referee as well.\u201d The former Italy World Cup official, Pierluigi Collina, had urged Uefa\u2019s referees last week to clamp down on petty fouls and here was clear evidence that his words had been heeded, albeit at Ramsey\u2019s expense. Yet Mazic, who was criticised for his display in Portugal\u2019s defeat by Germany at the World Cup, struggled to maintain control in the second half as tempers became increasingly frayed. The home manager, Slaven Bilic, was sent to the stands after complaining once too often at a decision, incensed that his team had not been allowed to play on after Mathieu Flamini had been left winded by a loose pass in the dying seconds. \u201cIt was a big game for us, right, and I just wasn\u2019t happy with some of the decisions,\u201d said the former Croatia manager. \u201cHe just showed me the way [off]. After the game I apologised to him and to Mr Wenger. I made a mistake. Maybe I overreacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit Flamini in the stomach and we were in a good position, two against one... But nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not my call (if Uefa impose sanctions ahead of the second leg). But I\u2019m not used to this kind of situation. I had 60 or 70 games in charge of Croatia, but I think this is only the second time I\u2019ve been asked out of the dug-out. I don\u2019t know the rules... but I see no reason for me not to be in the dug-out in London, really.\u201d Of the bottle incident on the final whistle, Wenger said: \u201cAs I left the pitch a bottle or something was thrown at me. I reported the incident to Uefa.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
