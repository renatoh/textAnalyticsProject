When reflecting on the 3-0 defeat against Bayern Munich on Wednesday, Rodgers insisted he would never deploy a wholly defensive team in an effort to snatch reward. \u201cYou are looking at the wrong man, it\u2019s not me,\u201d the Celtic manager said of going back to basics. \u201cI have no compromise. We play and our players will get better. You could maybe play for 100 years and never bridge the gap financially but we\u2019re working away in a difficult market in the Champions League and trying to compete. That\u2019s the overall objective, to be competitive at this level. Of course, you may have managers who do it in a different way but I have no compromise. It\u2019s how I work.\u201d Celtic generally retain a 4-2-3-1 formation, with two wingers, regardless of opposition. What undermines Rodgers\u2019s objective is that Celtic have not scored when being swatted aside by Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern in the past 13 months. They have not played with a verve that backs up the manager\u2019s policy, the memorable 3-3 draw with Manchester City last season aside. Rodgers conceded that taking confidence from the domestic scene, where Celtic have been imperious, into the Champions League is not an automatic process. \u201cIt\u2019s different but that\u2019s the pressure at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the top players, as well as having the physical attributes, have that mental courage to play as well. You can\u2019t just click your fingers and get that. That takes time, unfortunately. But this is an incredibly honest group of players and they give everything. \u201cTechnically they\u2019ve shown they\u2019re good enough to do it. Tactically they also got in good positions. But then you have to have the nerve. You need the nerve to play. The game now, the modern game, is moving away because of finances. \u201cFor us we want to be competitive and to do that we have to find a way, a different way. That\u2019s through an ideal of playing as a collective. It\u2019s about breeding that and growing that. But, listen, there is no shame in coming to the Allianz and losing 3-0. We had some chances and when you look at the goals we conceded they were disappointing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any shame in it at all. Bayern Munich are a world-class outfit. At times I thought we actually played and showed confidence but it takes more time to have that total faith.\u201d Rodgers said with a smile that those who insist Celtic should have signed a centre-back during the summer \u201cshould be on the coaching staff\u201d, in a nod towards hindsight. Nonetheless, the recurring injuries as suffered by Jozo Simunovic in particular seem to have triggered a desire for action from the former Liverpool manager. \u201cSince I\u2019ve come in here, from the very first day, we\u2019ve been struggling with the availability of central defenders,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cNot just one, not just two, it\u2019s been three and sometimes four. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve had to deal with and something we\u2019ll have to look at in terms of getting that consistency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
