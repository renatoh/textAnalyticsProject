A decent director could make the whole thing sound thrilling, a good deal more thrilling than it is at full length. That's because the Plastiscines have neglected to write anything much to fill in the gaps between those choruses. Their stock in trade is a clumsy garage-rock lurch that explodes into colour when the hook arrives, as if they realised they couldn't just leave dead air between refrains. When they try something more ambitious, as with Runaway, you can hear the gears clanking as they run through the different sections before the smooth running of the chorus. Singing in English, too, was ill-advised: it serves only to expose the callowness and vacancy of a set of lyrics that Noel Gallagher might dismiss as a little underdone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
