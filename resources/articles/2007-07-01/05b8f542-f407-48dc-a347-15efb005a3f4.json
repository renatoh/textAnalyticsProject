Lawyers for Media Sports Investments and Just Sports Inc - the companies who held the economic rights relating to Tevez when he moved to Upton Park last August - have lodged a breach-of-contract claim with the courts. Yesterday's development was the realisation of a threat that has been outstanding since April. That was when the Hammers tore up their agreements with MSI-JSI after pleading guilty to breaking two separate Premier League rules in their contracts with and conduct over Tevez. But MSI-JSI's position hardened only after Fifa, following dialogue with the Football Association and the League, recommended that the case be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"The companies seek the court's intervention to compel West Ham to release the registration of Carlos Tevez in accordance with contracts entered into between the parties,\" said Graham Shear, a solicitor for MSI-JSI. They are ready to highlight Tevez's eviction from his home - a flat in Canary Wharf that had been organised for him by West Ham - while he was away on Copa Am\u00e9rica duty with Argentina this summer. They will claim this is proof that the Hammers have not been consistent in asserting their rights over the player. Under pressure from the Premier League to stick by their decision to pull out of the agreements with MSI-JSI, West Ham are relying on Tevez's three-year playing contract and the registration document they hold as evidence that he is their own asset. The Hammers would also draw in their defence on the belief expressed by two QCs in a Premier League disciplinary hearing in April that the third-party contracts held with MSI-JSI are legally unenforceable. Yesterday's development means Tevez's hoped-for move to Old Trafford appears ever more distant. There has been no bid from the Premiership champions, without which the Premier League will not process a transfer. It is clear that the legal quandary must be resolved before Tevez can switch clubs. West Ham, who say they are \"happy\" to go to CAS, are puzzled as to why Tevez's camp would head for the civil courts. CAS could hear a complaint between August 10 and 15, allowing time for the Argentina forward's transfer to Manchester United to be processed before the August 31 transfer deadline; a High Court case could take months to be heard. But an Old Trafford spokesman last night said: \"We are hopeful that there will be an early resolution. We are happy with our case and confident he will be our player at the end of the transfer window.\" It is believed Joorabchian is willing to take the risk of a less swift process if he can guarantee an open and public hearing, such as is the case in the High Court. CAS - where decisions are binding and which may be appealed only on procedural grounds - would announce only its verdict, without providing details of its reasons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
