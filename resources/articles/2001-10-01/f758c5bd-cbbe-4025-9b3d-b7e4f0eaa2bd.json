If they have no prospect of earnings, they could well find that their biggest asset is the roof over their heads. The soaring property market has led to the over-60s having an estimated \u00a3550bn of equity in their homes. And while some are happy to trade down to a smaller property to release capital, most feel too attached to their homes to sell up and move. More and more people are turning to equity release schemes. These allow people to get their hands on cash or extra income, or both, by releasing the capital tied up in their home, without moving. The backlash following the bitter experiences suffered by the elderly, many of whom lost their homes after taking out high-risk schemes involving investment bonds and roll-up plans with variable rates of interest, has largely been thrown off. The new breed of equity release schemes make up one of the fastest growing sectors in the financial services industry. Last year alone, the amount of equity released more than doubled to \u00a3524m bringing the total currently on mortgage lenders' books to just under \u00a35bn. And a report due to be published later this month by the Council of Mortgage Lenders predicts that it will reach \u00a350bn over the next seven years. The past three years have seen the arrival of several new providers offering a wider range of products. These fall into two broad categories: reversion schemes and roll-up loans. They have largely replaced home income plans: the income they provide has fallen sharply since the scrapping of mortgage interest relief combined with worsening annuity rates, making them a real option only for those in their 80s. The new schemes are open to those below the age limit of 69 imposed by earlier schemes. They usually carry guarantees that the homeowner will be able to live in their property for the rest of their life. Some allow you to release capital even if you have a mortgage on the property. There are wide variations in these schemes' terms and conditions, so you need to check them out extremely carefully, preferably using a specialist financial adviser. Owing to their complexity, they are not necessarily fully regulated, although there are plans to bring them within the supervision of the financial services authority. You should therefore ensure that the provider is a member of the Ship (Save Home Income Plans) code of conduct which, along with other safeguards, includes a guarantee that you will not lose your home. Home reversion schemes allow homeowners to sell all or part of their property in return for tax-free cash, a regular income, or a combination of both while retaining the right to live there for life. There is no loan to repay, but, when you die, or the scheme comes to an end because the property is sold or you leave your home, the scheme provider then takes its share of the proceeds. Any increase in the value of the property will be split between you or your estate and the provider. However, some schemes can be transferred to a new property. Most companies allow you to sell less than the full value of the property but there is usually a minimum of 30% to 50%. Some schemes allow you to increase the share that you sell in subsequent years, which can be a better option than selling the full amount straight away as this won't allow you to raise any more money on your home, even if it increases in value. There is usually a minimum property value of \u00a340,000. When you sell your home or a share of it, you won't get the full open market value; only a percentage of it, which will depend on your life expectancy - older people get more than younger people, while men get more than women. Usually the amount you get is less than half the market value. The minimum age to enter a scheme is usually 65 to 70 - for couples, the ages are usually at the higher end of this range. The income you receive, which is provided through an annuity, is usually fixed so there is a danger that if you participate when you are relatively young, the money you have to live on will be eroded by inflation - unless your scheme links the income paid to increases in property values. While it may seem a good idea to delay because your income increases the older you are when you start a scheme, in practice you could lose out as it would take many years to make up the difference. If you choose to take the money as a lump sum, some schemes enable you to take it in instalments over a set number of years, which could increase the overall amount you receive. Some schemes allow you to receive a combination of cash and income. Roll-up loans are the latest entrants to the market. For many they are simpler to understand because they are mortgage-related. However, they are potentially the most risky type of equity release scheme because the longer you live, the bigger the debt will be. Basically, you mortgage your property for part of its capital value but do not have to make any repayments of capital or interest until the property is sold. During the term of the loan, the interest is added to the original loan on a compound interest basis. It is repaid by your estate on your death. Their main attraction is that these loans are available to people in their 60s and you retain the ownership of your home while you live there and gain the full benefit of any increase in its value. But, depending on how long you live, this could be wiped out by the rolled-up interest. For example, if the interest rate is fixed at 7% on a \u00a320,000 loan, the debt will double after 10 years to \u00a341,200 and will be as much as \u00a385,000 after 20 years. Usually, the maximum you can borrow is 50% of the value of your property. It can be less than 20% if you are 60, so the amount of money you can access is usually less than through a reversion scheme. It is crucial that any plan you take out charges a fixed rate of interest and carries a guarantee that the amount owing will never exceed what the property is worth and you are free to move home. Proceeds from your loan can be taken in cash up-front or you can opt to take an initial lump sum and then receive annual payments. Another alternative is a flexible drawdown facility, whereby you only take out cash when you need it. The money realised can also be used to invest in an annuity to provide income. What you need to do Discuss the matter with your family as the value of your estate and any potential inheritance could be substantially reduced. Ask how your tax position will be affected. Consider how inflation might erode your extra fixed income. Find out how a rise or fall in property prices will affect you. Will your state of health affect your use of the scheme? Check that the scheme allows you to stay in your property for life and, if you move home, there is no penalty. Discover what the effect of any change in your personal life, such as remarriage, would be. Only use schemes offered by a Ship member. Seek specialist independent advice. Choose a solicitor to act on your behalf who has experience of equity release schemes.
