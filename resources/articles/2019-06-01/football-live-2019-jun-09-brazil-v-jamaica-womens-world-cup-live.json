Thanks for reading everyone, and there will be a full report on site soon. Cheers! Brazil might not be among the main challengers for this World Cup, but they showed enough here to suggest they will be dangerous, at least. And all without Marta. At the very least, they\u2019ll be delighted to have ended that nine-game losing run. You\u2019d expect them to win the group, after this. Good game, that. Brazil were obviously the better team by some way but Jamaica were just threatening enough to make it interesting. That said, Brazil should have won by more than the three goals, the sterling efforts of the absurdly young Schneider in nets keeping the score down. Peeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +4: Brazil have a three-on-two but stuff it up: Geyse\u2019s pass for Debinha is a bit overhit, but once she picks up the ball she chooses a glory shot rather than looking for either of her two colleagues in some space in the middle. The less said about where that shot ended up the better. 90 mins +2: Jamaica on the hunt for a consolation. A free-kick on the right side of the box is half-cleared, then Shaw puts in a cross from the left which also comes to nothing. 90 mins: Brilliant feet from Debinha out on the left, who spins and sends Plummer for a sandwich, clips a cross into the middle where Ludmilla and Schneider collide, both miss the ball and it\u2019s decreed that the forward fouled the keeper. Four minutes of added time are signalled. 88 mins: Another big chance goes a beggin\u2019. Ludmilla does superbly to nick the ball off the toes of a dawdling Plummer, but having done the hard bit and got through on goal, her shot is weak and wide. 86 mins: Jamaica are still going for a consolation, but don\u2019t seem to quite have the wit to break through. Shaw has had a bit of a thankless task up top, although she has looked pretty good. 83 mins: A bad couple of minutes for Daiane, who is winded after getting in the way of a rasping shot from Asher. 82 mins: A booking for Daiane, who gets her collar felt for taking out Shaw with a late, hacking challenge. 80 mins: Another big miss by Brazil, not that it especially matters. A rare error in judgement from Schneider as she comes out to cut out a through ball but can\u2019t get there ahead of Geyse, who nips around the keeper, but the angle is too tight for a shot so cuts it back across goal. Ludmilla is presented with a sort of open goal (a few defenders were in the area) but she sticks it into the side-netting. 79 mins: Final sub for Jamaica: Trudi Carter is withdrawn, in favour of Tiffany Cameron. 78 mins: Brilliant save from Schneider! Geyse, who has looked lively since coming on, collects the ball after a slick passing interchange and shoots low, and left-footed, but Schneider sprawls away down to her left and flips the ball wide. It could genuinely have been five or six if not for the 19-year-old in Jamaica\u2019s nets. 75 mins: Another change for Brazil, as Diane replaces Kathellen, who had been in some injury bother in the last few minutes. 73 mins: Shaw bullies Kathellen out of possession and looks for a crossfield pass, but slips just as she is drawing her foot back and the chance is gone. 72 mins: Another sub for Jamaica: Havana Solaun goes off, Chinyelu Asher comes on. 71 mins: Corner for Brazil after a quiet couple of minutes, but in the middle Ludmilla is penalised for a handball. 67 mins: Kathellen does herself some form of mischief in blocking a Shaw shot, but after a bit of treatment she seems fine. From the resultant corner, Barbara claims easily. 65 mins: Double sub for Brazil: that\u2019s a good day\u2019s work for Cristiane who, along with Beatriz is taken off, to be replaced by Geyse and Ludmilla. 64 mins: Cristiane herself is fouled just outside the D and to the left. She steps up and pings a free-kick off the bar, it bounces down behind the line and for fans of these sort of aesthetics bounces up and hits the bar again, but the ref\u2019s watch buzzes and Cristiane\u2019s treble is complete. Hat-trick for Cristiane! 62 mins: Sub for Jamaica: Cheyna Matthews off, Jody Brown on. 61 mins: Oh good lord, how did she miss? Allyson Swaby clips a cross from the right over Barbara, and Carter is there at the far post to seemingly complete an easy finish, but she skews it into the side-netting. Huge chance for Jamaica, that. 59 mins: That free-kick from deep is skimmed into the box by Sweatman, Barbara absolutely steams off her line to claim it but Shaw gets there first, flicks it on past the keeper but Allyson Swaby can\u2019t quite get there to divert into the empty net. 58 mins: Ooof. The old stager Formiga goes into the book, much to her chagrin: she tackles Shaw from behind, with the first swing seeming to get something on the ball but the trailing leg took the Jamaica forward out. 57 mins: The corner comes to nothing. Meanwhile, a point worth making about the penalty earlier. 56 mins: Debinha tries a shot that we can file under \u2018 optimistic\u2019 from way downtown, but it\u2019s deflected and spins wide. 54 mins: A Jamaica attack, but snuffed out: Carter takes a shot from just inside the area, which is blocked and they can\u2019t get the cross back in. 51 mins: Brazil are in again, with Debinha scrapping to find her way through on goal, but she loses her footing - in her opinion but crucially not the ref\u2019s - thanks to a shove from her marker, and Schneider does just about enough to stop her. 50 mins: Fairly simple one this time. Andressa puts in a low, searching cross betwixt keeper and defence, Schneider just misses it and Cristiane arrives at the back post with an open goal but a tight angle, and despite Plummer\u2019s best efforts the ball goes over the line. Lead, doubled! 49 mins: Some holes open in the Jamaica defence and the ball falls to Cristiane, but her shot deflects wide. 48 mins: Plummer brings the ball out of defence well but with Shaw making a run right, she passes left and straight to a defender. 46 mins: Jamaica start the second half by knocking the ball around a bit, something that they didn\u2019t do so much in the opening 45. We\u2019re back out for the second half. No changes for either side, that I can see. Cracking game, this. Cristiane\u2019s goal was top drawer, the perfect header from a perfect cross, but Brazil should really be further ahead, not least due to that missed penalty. That said, what Jamaica\u2019s attacks have lacked in frequency they have made up for in potency: they could have scored two or three times, and the only real surprise is there\u2019s only been one goal so far. Peeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins: One minute of added time. Boos greet a free-kick awarded to Brazil. 44 mins: Bond-Flasza goes long, looking for the run of Shaw, but the pass is too strong. 41 mins: Also just reminding ourselves that Schneider is 19 years old and plays her domestic football for the University of North Carolina. She\u2019s playing like a 15-year-old veteran at the moment. 40 mins: Brazil should be pretty vexed that they\u2019re not further ahead in this one, but Jamaica could easily be level. Football, isn\u2019t it. 38 mins: The excellent keeping in this game continues, although Schneider had moved a couple of steps to her right, but Andressa doesn\u2019t read the telegraph correctly and goes low and not very hard in that direction, allowing Schneider to save. 37 mins: Seems harsh. The ball is thwacked at Allyon Swaby from about two yards away, it hits the arm and thus a penalty is given. It\u2019s checked by VAR but it stands, and up steps Andressa... 36 mins: Yeesh, Jamaica could be level. Barbara comes out for a cross which looks like it might have dipped a bit before she reached it. She catches, but it squirts from her grasp like an errant bar of soap and it pops out to Shaw, who shoots but Barbara is up as quick as a flash to block and redeem herself. 34 mins: The late, late, late offside flag strikes again, as it has a number of times in the tournament: Leticia Santos puts a brilliant pass through to Cristiane, who\u2019s about two yards offside but the lino waits until next Thursday to signal it. 31 mins: Brazil should probably be two ahead. Debinha gets down the left, cuts back into the middle where - I think - Andressa is waiting with a clear shot on goal about 12 yards out, but Cristiane nicks it off her toes, miscontrols and the chance disappears. 29 mins: Yowzers. From virtually nowhere Shaw, on the run and just outside the box on the right, hammers a shot towards the top corner but Barbara sticks up a mitt and tips the stinging effort over the bar. Both keepers have been terrific so far. 27 mins: Super work by Schneider in the Jamaica goal, as she comes out for a chest-high cross with Debinha and Cristiane lurking, and she deserves the bit of luck she gets as the ball pops back into her arms. 26 mins: Two Brazilian defenders - Kathellen and Monica - collide with each other and one bounces off and bashes into Carter, but for reasons unclear that\u2019s deemed a foul by the Jamaican forward. Weird. 25 mins: Huge chance for Brazil as Debinha finds herself through on goal after a brilliant pass through by Andressa, but she gets the ball stuck under her feet slightly and the shot is weak. Cristiane was screaming for it square, but the replays suggest she would have been offside had the pass come. 24 mins: Most of Jamaica\u2019s threat seems to have come from big crosses into the box looking for Shaw, which they try again, but once more Barbara is up to it and clears the cross. 21 mins: Beatriz hassles the ball off Blackwood in the Jamaica left-back slot, cuts inside but loses it before she has a chance to shoot. 19 mins: Matthews looks lively down the Jamaica right, but as she sprints and lollipops her way down the flank Formiga decides that this young sprite must be taught a thing or two, and puts in a fair but crunching tackle, leaving Matthews to briefly consider her life choices on the Grenoble turf. 18 mins: Andressa, who\u2019s been at the heart of everything Brazil have done so far, curls the free-kick harmlessly over the bar. 17 mins: Brazil not letting up and they\u2019re on the attack again, inducing a foul and indeed yellow card as Plummer takes out Thaisa around 30 yards from goal. 15 mins: Brazil have been knock, knock, knockin\u2019 on the door, and they burst through it after Andressa is given too much time to pick out a cross from the left, landing it right on Cristiane\u2019s head who superbly guides it inside the far post. What a header! 14 mins: Brazil have dominated but Jamaica have the first proper effort on target, as Shaw cuts in from the left and shoots earlier than the defenders were expecting, but it doesn\u2019t fool Barbara, who saves with relative ease at the near post. 12 mins: A free-kick for Brazil deep on the left, which Andressa booms into the box. Monica goes up for the header but glances it wide. Cannot confirm whether she said \u2018the ball is mine\u2019 as she went up for it. 11 mins: The players have briefly paused for breath, perhaps for the benefit of minute-by-minuters with frantic fingers. Debinha tries to get in behind the defence again but Plummer arrives to muscle her out. 8 mins: All action here. Matthews lofts a cross into the middle where Shaw is waiting, but Barbara does well to come out and claim. Then Brazil zoot up the other end, Debinha is set free behind the Jamaica defence and tries to go around Schneider, but the keeper does brilliantly to paw the ball away, and then deal with the follow-up from Brazil\u2019s No.9. 6 mins: Another corner for Brazil, this one from the left which Debinha zings in, but Schneider advances off her line and punches clear. Jamaica attack for the first time after Leticia Santos underhits a backpass to Barbara, but she just gets there in time to clear. 4 mins: That corner is cleared at the back post. Brazil look like they\u2019re going for the jugular straight away so it will be a tough old task to see if the Jamaicans can hold out, and how long for. 3 mins: Another corner for Brazil, which drops to Thaisa on the edge of the box but her effort is deflected behind for...another corner. A slightly frantic start here. 2 mins: The corner comes to nothing and is cleared upfield. It\u2019s lucky that Brazil keeper Barbara was looking sharp, because she had to advance to clear the thing from the edge of the centre circle, with Shaw lurking. 1 min: We\u2019re away. Brazil win a corner straight away as Blackwood nips ahead of Debinha to put it behind. As has just been pointed out on the BBC, this is Formiga\u2019s seventh - SEVENTH - World Cup. She made her debut in 1995, meaning she has been playing international football for longer than six of the Jamaica players have been alive. The Brazilian anthem, a highlight of any World Cup, rings out. The good news is I\u2019ve just had a quick look at the lyrics and it\u2019s not one of those about marauding across foreign lands or pillaging etc, so you\u2019re safe. Here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s report from the other game in this group, as Italy beat Australia with that late goal. How late? Very late. The weather looks hazy but the mood seems lively in Grenoble. The players are gathering in the tunnel. Let\u2019s football. Fancy some team guides? Look no further: Brazil Jamaica A dramatic finish to the preceding game, where Italy have just beaten Australia with a late, late, late, late, late header. You\u2019ll note that Khadija \u2018Bunny\u2019 Shaw is starting up top for Jamaica. She was of course named the Guardian footballer of the year for 2018. Here\u2019s her interview with Bryan Arnhem Graham to explain why. Advantage Jamaica. Brazil Barbara; Letica, Kathellen, Monica, Tamires; Andressa, Thaisa, Formiga, Debinha; Bia Zaneratto, Cristiane. Jamaica Schneider; Bond-Flasza, Plummer, Allyson Swaby, Blackwood; Chantelle Swaby, Solaun, Sweatman; Matthews, Shaw, Carter. Team news will be along shortly, but just a reminder that, while this could be her last World Cup, Marta will miss this one with a thigh injury. The romantics among you may well be rooting for Brazil to go all the way in this tournament, what with it quite possibly/probably being the last hurrah of Marta, six-time world player of the year, Golden Ball winner at the 2007 tournament and quite probably the greatest player ever. But while plenty have tipped England, France, Japan, Germany - who simply must not be written off, a sentiment transcending sport and gender - basically nobody has mentioned Brazil. Is there a reason for that? Well, yes. They\u2019re not very good. Since winning the Copa America last year they\u2019ve been utter toilet, losing their last nine games, including a wipeout in the SheBelieves Cup, and while you can decide for yourself how relevant that tournament actually is, all in all it\u2019s not the greatest sign in the world for their chances in France. As for Jamaica, this is their first time at the World Cup so there will inevitably be a \u2018happy to be here\u2019 vibe about them and their primary aim will be to get out of the group. Will all of that actually make for a decent game here? Possibly. These are after all two teams on whom there might not be much expectation, potentially freeing them up to play a bit more expressively. Or it could simply turn out that neither side is very good and it will be rubbish. Only one way to find out.
