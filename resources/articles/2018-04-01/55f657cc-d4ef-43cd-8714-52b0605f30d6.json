A massive gap to the top, a massive three points and a massive opportunity. It is also these massive matches, according to the Tottenham manager, that bring out the best in Dele Alli. The England international turned 22 on Wednesday and celebrated by performing the Floss, a viral dance, on Instagram and attending a Peaky Blinders-themed party. Of greater interest to his coach, and his upcoming opponents, will be the statistics that show Alli has made a greater attacking contribution to his team than Cristiano Ronaldo did at the same age. During a season when Alli has been under constant scrutiny, Pochettino called the midfielder \u201cthe best 21-year-old in the world\u201d. Now, as a 22-year-old, his manager explained why Alli\u2019s talent was \u201cnot something you can buy at the market\u201d. \u201cFor me it\u2019s a massive challenge to play Manchester City,\u201d he said. \u201c[For Alli] he needs a strong opposition to give his best. It\u2019s his character. He is so competitive that when it\u2019s easy he\u2019s not interested. In training sessions, when you do finishing practice without any opposition, sometimes you have to say: \u2018Dele, come on.\u2019 But if you put opposition there, he will score an unbelievable goal. \u201cHe is a bit special. Not just a special talent but a special character. That is why we are talking a lot during the whole season about Dele Alli because he is a special talent with special energy. He needs to feel the competition.\u201d Alli elaborated on his manager\u2019s thoughts, explaining why he benefits from playing against the top teams. Alli has scored nine of his 36 league goals for Spurs against the other top-six clubs, five of those in matches with Chelsea, including two at Stamford Bridge last month. His current tally against Manchester City is two. \u201cWhen you play in the Premier League against the top six, as opposed to bottom-half teams, the game is always a lot different,\u201d Alli said after last Saturday\u2019s fixture with Stoke. \u201cThe top six really go at it with you. Both teams want to win and there\u2019s a lot more space. Both teams are looking to attack. \u201cTeams in the bottom half, they still have a lot of qualities and they can hurt you at any time, but they\u2019re more likely to sit off and close the gaps in between the lines so it\u2019s a lot more difficult for a No 10 to get on the ball and create chances.\u201d As for City, Alli believes there will be opportunities against them. \u201cMan City are an amazing team, they\u2019ve been very good this year, but we want to win every game and we fancy ourselves against anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course [an attacking approach] can work. They\u2019re only human, they can make mistakes. They\u2019re an incredible team with incredible players all over the pitch, but we\u2019re going to try to play our football as we always do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
