In fact, the view at David Finlay\u2019s farm on the Dumfries and Galloway coast is a sight you\u2019d be unlikely to see on any other dairy farm in the UK. Almost all calves are separated from cows within hours or days of birth on dairy farms. This allows farmers to sell the milk that the calves would otherwise drink. But it is a reality of dairy farming that jars with animal welfare campaigners and consumers, and one of the sector\u2019s three biggest emotive issues, along with giving cows outdoor access and the killing of male calves straight after birth. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing we\u2019ve always been asked about by mums on our farm tours,\u201d says Finlay. \u201cThey just don\u2019t like seeing calves separated from their mothers so soon.\u201d The public reaction has led to a slow growth of a new sector, calling itself \u201cethical dairy farming\u201d, where the calves are not removed immediately from their mothers. One expert estimates that around 400 dairy farms in Europe and Australia are trialling methods \u2013 varying widely from one farm to the next \u2013 for what is known as \u201ccalf at foot\u201d systems. With a herd of 125 cows, Finlay\u2019s farm near Castle Douglas in south-west Scotland is the largest known producer in Europe to introduce the calf at foot system. But the switch, now in its third year, has been far from easy. Finlay began the project in 2017 with the hope of proving such a method could work at a bigger scale. \u201cThe first year was disastrous,\u201d he says, admitting that he wanted to call it quits. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get the cows away from the calves and into the milking parlour. For weeks we\u2019d be dragging the cows in there. \u201cIt took a long time for them to trust that the calves were still going to be there when they came back. It was so much stress as the cows just weren\u2019t used to it and didn\u2019t know what the rules were.\u201d Finlay had to be talked into keeping the system going for another year by his family and other staff after his herdsman grew sceptical about the project and left, but by the second year the cows had begun to grow used to having their offspring around. The calves still need to be separated after weaning at around five months, a process Finlay and his new herdsman Charles Ellett have learned to manage by starting off with overnight periods of separation first. \u201cThat first day we don\u2019t open the gates in the morning though there is a huge outcry from the calves and cows,\u201d says Finlay, who has got round it by introducing a surrogate mother \u2013 usually an older cow not producing much milk. They then use this cow to lead all the calves into a field on the other side of the farm to settle them. The initial period of overnight separation helps create social bonds between the calves, says Finlay, making the final separation easier. The female calves will then stay on the farm to become milking cows, while the male calves are sold after five to seven months to produce veal. Leaving calves with their mothers has been found to reduce mortality rates and help them grow quicker by having all-day access to their mother\u2019s milk, rather than a milk powder substitute. The suckling can also help protect cows against mastitis, one of the biggest disease risks facing dairy farming today. However, the suckling adds up to \u201ccrazy amounts of milk\u201d lost to the farmer to sell, says Finlay. He estimates his losses at more than 2,000 litres per cow being taken by the calf, which equates to upwards of \u00a3500 in lost revenue based on the current UK average milk price. The cows also hold back fat for their calves when taken into the milking parlour, \u201cgiving us semi-skimmed milk\u201d, jokes Finlay. But Finlay believes the model can work and that the improvement in the health and immune systems of the young calves will yield long-term dividends that will compensate, to some extent, for loss of milk. And he has already seen a surge in interest in what he is doing from across the UK and overseas. Last year he raised more than \u00a350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to support the farm and its cheese production facilities. Conversely, vegan activism has also helped, he says. \u201cThere was no demand for it before, but vegan campaigners have raised awareness [among consumers of higher animal welfare] and created a market for us to supply dairy to. Plant-based milks have also got people used to paying more for dairy,\u201d he says. It is the loss in milk more than anything else that Finlay thinks will put off all but a niche group of dairy farmers from ever considering it unless they can secure a premium for the leftover milk. However, he is hopeful that consumer support for more ethical farming approaches will be boosted by activism. But other dairy farmers remain sceptical of the health and welfare benefits for the cows and calves \u2013 as well as the economics of making it viable. \u201cIt\u2019s only ethical if you don\u2019t know what the downsides are,\u201d says National Farmers\u2019 Union dairy board member Phil Latham, who runs a dairy farm in Cheshire and separates his calves at one week. \u201cYes, the calves get to spend more time with their mother, but there are a whole host of compromises with an increase in disease risk from the mixing of different age groups and a lack of control over the calf\u2019s food intake. The longer you leave the calf on the cow, the bigger the stress when you do separate them. \u201cIt\u2019s pandering to urban ignorance. If he can get a market premium from doing it and survive the milk losses then good luck to him, but it\u2019s not about maximising welfare in my mind,\u201d he says. Academic researchers say early separation within 24 hours has been found in some cases to reduce distress for both beef and dairy cows and calves, although the evidence for dairy calves is still inconclusive. \u201cThe faster you break the bond [between cow and calf] the fewer vocalisations you are going to get from calves,\u201d says Marina Von Keyserlingk, a professor in animal welfare at the University of British Columbia. Helen Browning, dairy farmer and CEO of the organic trade body the Soil Association, separates her calves and cows within 24 hours, but then keeps them with a surrogate mother cow who has been retired or rested from the dairy herd. Under organic standards, calves are separated from their mothers after birth, but are always kept in groups and must be given cow\u2019s milk for their first 12 weeks. \u201cCalves hate being weaned and cows hate their calves being taken away, whether after one day or five months. But it is better to do it before a bond has developed. In nature cows would live together as a family with cows and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, so we are already interfering a lot with that family process,\u201d she says. In terms of cow and calf health and welfare, farm vets say separation is not a priority. \u201cIf you really want to improve animal welfare then we should try to tackle lameness, calf mortality and ensuring the calf gets sufficient quantities of colostrum,\u201d says Dr Kathryn Ellis, a farm animal vet at the University of Glasgow. Browning says dairy farmers are looking to learn from what Finlay is doing, but that the industry still needs to think through what is best for the welfare of both calves and cows being kept to produce milk. \u201cWe should think about what issue we\u2019re trying to resolve. Is it an emotive issue or a welfare issue? I think it is the former.\u201d Despite the scepticism, Von Keyserlingk estimates that more than 400 dairy farms are trialling calf at foot systems in Europe and Australia. Not far from Finlay\u2019s farm in south-west Scotland, another dairy farmer keeping calves with their mothers has recently started selling his milk to consumers at \u00a31.59 a pint. \u201cThis could be the norm in 20-30 years, just as tie-stalls were in the past. But it\u2019s a fundamental change for how farms operate so we need to help farmers figure out how to make it better for the health and welfare of cows and calves and at the same time practical for farmers,\u201d says von Keyserlingk. \u201cTo better support farmers in this transition, new research is needed on how these systems may be managed to function best for the cows and calves, including reducing the risk of currently common production diseases such as mastitis and lameness,\u201d she adds.
