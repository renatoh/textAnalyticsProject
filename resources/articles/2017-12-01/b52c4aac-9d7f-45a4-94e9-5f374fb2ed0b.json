Nola Darling, an artist in gentrified Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is entangled with three lovers: Greer (arch-narcissist and self-identified \u201cbiracial Adonis\u201d), Jamie (a financially stable older man who craves Nola\u2019s commitment) and Mars (a sweet, big-hearted nerd, closer to Nola in age and temperament but without the social status of the other men). Really, it\u2019s about Nola striving to define herself as a black woman against others\u2019 ideas of her. In dynamic, collage-style filmmaking, Lee gets his characters to speak directly to the camera and casts a feminist gaze on Nola\u2019s lovers. This isn\u2019t how you think TV works: we regularly cut away to the album covers of the music cues (Mary J Blige, Jill Scott), detour through Nola\u2019s public art campaigns against sexual harassment, and end on a #BlackMattersLives tagline. Like Jill Soloway\u2019s feminist epic, I Love Dick, on Amazon earlier this year, it\u2019s wonderful to see truly independent (and independent-thinking) directors delivering such experimental longform storytelling outside cinemas to our home laptop screens. TV: Lady Dynamite season two (US, 2017) by Maria Bamford, Pam Brady and Mitch Hurwitz \u2013 out now Several years ago, Netflix gave Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz an office, a budget and a mandate to make odd comedy. Lady Dynamite is the deadly funny, really-far-out-there result. It stars Maria Bamford, a standup comic with mental health issues playing a standup comic with mental health issues. The show\u2019s meta structure is next-levelled as we ricochet from the present day to the future, where she\u2019s making a sitcom-inside-a-sitcom called Maria Bamford is Nuts, to her teenaged past with her loving but churchy and infantilising parents in Minnesota. In a departure from the \u201cno one hugs, no one learns\u201d anti-trajectory of current comedy trends, Bamford just wants to live a regular, well-adjusted life. Where season one centred on her return to daily normality after a stay in a psychiatric institution, season two is about Maria\u2019s transition to living with her first-ever long-term partner, accelerating towards their wedding and throwing her back into mania. Bamford\u2019s brain, and her comedy, work differently: her pet dogs are fully-fledged characters who speak to her, people such as Judd Apatow have hilarious cameos only to vanish an instant later. Kookily innovative in its storytelling and style, it all makes its own kind of divine sense, while upholding a weird spiritual optimism. TV: The Crown season two (US, 2017) by Peter Morgan \u2013 out now Last year, I described the first season of The Crown as \u201can immaculately art-directed propaganda biopic aimed at humanising those in the monarchy and positioning the Queen as a kind of proto-feminist ... politically dubious addictive longform prestige trash.\u201d Nothing has changed in this high-budget monarchist soapie, but would you want it to? Ranging from the mid 1950s to the 1960s, the second season centres very much on Elizabeth and Philip\u2019s treacherous second decade of marriage (unelected plutocrats \u2013 they\u2019re just like us!), opening with Lizzy declaring her impossible wish to divorce, and arcing toward cheating, lying, revolting against Philip\u2019s possible redemption. We also discover some helpful and actually historically accurate information regarding the Royal family\u2019s Nazi connections. All the while, Lizzy\u2019s hubby remains an emasculated sulky baby; her uncle, the abdicated Edward, a self-serving fascist (literally); and her sister Margaret is still lazily characterised as an emotionally insecure goodtime gal. It\u2019s hard not to see The Crown as a missed opportunity: a tragedy of dramatic irony in which the godly, uber-rich Windsors fail to see that their place in a modern society has become eclipsed by secular republicanism, and in which Lizzy becomes increasingly cold and detached from the world. But the show remains wonderfully digestible garbage, a grand-scaled and cashed-up family melodrama. Honourable mentions: My Happy Family, Inland Empire, People Places Things (films, out now), Please Like Me season four (TV, 22 December). Stan Film: Proof (Australia, 1991) by Jocelyn Moorhouse \u2013 out now Australian writer-director Jocelyn Moorhouse\u2019s debut film found a new way to do closely observed filmmaking \u2013 by creating a blind character who takes photographs and labels them with Braille as a way of recording his movements, an uncertain creator of his own small world. As Martin, Hugo Weaving is at the centre of the character study. Genevi\u00e8ve Picot is Celia, his housekeeper and would-be lover, and Russell Crowe is a stranger and new friend Andy, whose presence antagonises Celia and Martin\u2019s close but tenuous bond and edges them towards a love triangle. As we flashback through Martin\u2019s childhood, Andy offers his own interpretations of Martin\u2019s photographs, shedding new light on the blind man\u2019s understanding of his past, and the psychological drama moves at times toward the comedy and melodrama of Moorhouse\u2019s later films such as The Dressmaker. TV: Rake (Australia, 2010-2016) seasons one to four, by Richard Roxburgh and Peter Duncan \u2013 out now Now is the time to catch up on perhaps the standout series on Australian television, ahead of next year\u2019s new season. The last season projected that Rake\u2019s satire of NSW politics would go national, as Cleaver Greene catapulted himself towards an independent seat in the Senate. But there\u2019s so much more to Rake than dank #auspol critiques. Every little bit of the show is excellent: the acute writing; the barbed dialogue; the bleak comic beats; the vision of Sydney as a gentrified swamp that has utter contempt for anyone who isn\u2019t filthy rich and negatively geared; the cameos from A-listers as cynical Labor politicians; the characterisation of self-sabotaging Cleaver Greene by Richard Roxburgh; the dynamics of his much-abused loved ones who both empathise with and enable him. At the end of the last season, Cleaver skirted close to a reunification with the love of his life; the reverberations should be the perfect place for season five to start next year. Foxtel Now Film: Misery (US, 1990) by Rob Reiner \u2013 out now Is there ever a bad time to return to this classic and screechingly stressful psychological thriller? When Paul, a famous novelist (James Caan), crashes his car in the deep snow of the Colorado winter, Annie, a super-fan (Kathy Bates) who happens to be a nurse, comes to his rescue. But her heroism is motivated by fanaticism, and as the story unspools, her motives become clearer and her mind more deranged. The drama is amazingly pared down by today\u2019s standards: confined almost entirely to a different kind of haunted house, and wired to the dynamics of just two characters, as if we\u2019re trapped there with them. Everything else is cut away to expertly bring Paul and Annie\u2019s emotions to a most enjoyable boil. Directed by Rob Reiner, from a Stephen King novel, with Lauren Bacall and her wonderfully ambivalent, sardonic smile popping up as Paul\u2019s literary agent. Honourable mentions: Wall Street, Speed (films, out now), Con Air (film, 25 December), Raiders of the Lost Ark (film, 26 December), The Social Network (film, 31 December). Dendy Direct Film: The Trip to Spain (UK, 2017) by Michael Winterbottom \u2013 out 6 December A melancholic comedy about two affable British actors in the throes of midlife crisis, eating their way across Europe and talking shit shouldn\u2019t be this compelling. But after The Trip (2010) and The Trip to Italy (2014), watching Steve Coogan (Alan Partridge) and Rob Brydon talk in silly voices about career insecurities, body malfunctions and existential dilemmas, sitting in restaurants and hotel balconies and vineyards on the pretext of being restaurant reviewers, is oddly glorious, and, may I say, life-affirming in a no-nonsense way. However you categorise it \u2013 mockumentary-meets-drama-meets-scripted comedy \u2013 The Trip to Spain is really a film about ageing, disappointment and death, by two smart, brutally funny people approaching their senior years. Sign me up for a Trip to France. Honourable mentions: Dunkirk (film, 18 December). SBS On Demand Film: Night Parrot Stories (Australia, 2016) by Robert Nugent \u2013 out 24 December One of the most interesting and experimental Australian films of the past couple of years, Night Parrot Stories is a documentary that goes beyond its remit \u2013 to find a glimpse of the long-lost night parrot of central Australia, heard but not seen in 80 years \u2013 to deliver something more personal, elusive and poetic than you might expect. Armed with his own camera, filmmaker Robert Nugent steps out to the places the parrot has been seen and heard, speaking with Indigenous elders, European museum professionals and outback residents to collect a constellation of viewpoints on the maybe-extinct bird, and the extinctions that are yet to come if capitalism and global warming continue unabated. This is a film that looks towards to future, yet has its roots firmly in pre-colonial ecology, framed by memory and recall of creatures and cultures that may be lost forever. Film: A Separation (Iran, 2011) by Asghar Fahadi \u2013 out now Asghar Fahadi\u2019s films are minutely conceived dramas that zoom in on the crossroads of their characters\u2019 lives to spell out grander moral and political visions. In this one, an Iranian couple must decide whether to leave the country for a better life or stay to care for a sick parent \u2013 with the drama increasingly enveloped by the court system as their marriage ruptures. Fahadi is an analytical, cerebral filmmaker. He knows how to move the dramatic stakes from low-key to knife-edge. This is not a melodramatic or emotionally open film but one in which the pace is slowed down and anchored excruciatingly to the everyday. Like The Salesman from earlier this year, A Separation is attuned to how people stoically adjust to their obligations, and to the grand moments of breakdown in which exquisitely rendered interpersonal dynamics blow open each character\u2019s blindspots of self-awareness. The overall feeling of this Oscar-winning film is of being trapped in a life that isn\u2019t yours; the paths the plot takes are labyrinthine and mundanely claustrophobic, underscored by a sense of terrible futility and fate that is difficult to see as anything but a political commentary on Iran today. TV: Martha and Snoop\u2019s Potluck Dinner Party season one (US, 2017) \u2013 out now Thank you Viceland for this glorious piece of ironic programming. Think of the conventions you know of a cooking show: a live audience, a shiny aspirational kitchen set. Now divide that set down the middle, give one half to cashmere-cloaked, recovered white-collar criminal Martha Stewart, and the other to hip-hop legend Snoop Dogg, and put a fake DJ on the side. Our odd couple cook up themed tasty treats \u2013 pizza, pasta, pork, nose-to-tail \u2013 and mix cocktails, with famous special guests (including 50 Cent and trained chef Kelis). Now imagine Snoop \u2013 who clearly doesn\u2019t cook ever and cannot follow basic (life) instructions \u2013 delivering cooking-show segues to the camera, deadpan: \u201cAnd when we come back, my finger-licking ribs will be ready.\u201d The real joy is how both he and newly \u201chood certified\u201d Martha are gamely aware of the show\u2019s absurdity \u2013 it\u2019s a big joke, but they\u2019re committed to it. There\u2019s nothing quite as slickly produced or high-budget on Australian television. TV: Search Party season two (US, 2017) by Sarah-Violet Bliss, Charles Rogers and Michael Showalter \u2013 out now Despite being a distinctly New York creation \u2013 and a noir sitcom \u2013 Search Party manages to conjure the modern universal impossible moment: a vision of big-city loneliness, of un-partnered, underemployed millennial youth floating about like leaves. The second season sees us realise something its protagonist, Dory (Arrested Development\u2019s Alia Shawkat), remains unable to \u2013 that her fixation, in season one, with distant college friend Chantal\u2019s disappearance, was led by the delusional desire to have a cause and be a hero. Chantal\u2019s presumed murder led in turn to a catastrophe of Dory and her friends\u2019 own making, and now they are desperately covering their tracks. The brilliance of this show is that it has no \u201cmoral compass\u201d character. The humour is bitterly dark and the laughs come every minute, much of them milked from how individually and intimately each character is responding to the trauma they created in season one, particularly Elliot (John Early) who now departs reality altogether. A brilliant and oddly empathetic skewering of the blind spots of late-capitalist narcissism. Honourable mentions: Carol, Purple Rain, Happy-Go-Lucky, Apocalypto (films, out now). ABC iView TV: You See Monsters (Australia, 2017) by Tony Jackson \u2013 out now Post-9/11, Muslim artists have become more noticeable. \u201cPeople see us as one hegemonic group that are all the same,\u201d says Abdul Abdullah Rahman, a young artist whose work critiques the idea of the Muslim monster. While Muslims have come to consume a larger part of the national imagination \u2013 fears of white Australia being swamped, invaded, terrorised, bombed \u2013 this documentary hands the microphone to artists of all kinds of ethnicities who identify as Muslim. I haven\u2019t seen anything like this on Australian television \u2013 a show that combines political critique with arts journalism. Getting smart, interesting young artists to tell personal stories about being Australian and Muslim \u2013 talking about the difference between how others see them and how they see themselves, the way their transition into adulthood has been overshadowed by the war on terrorism \u2013 proves a powerful device for cutting through the fearful rhetoric of the Muslim as an imagined bad guy. Interlaced with images of the artworks themselves, this is great TV documentary-making. TV: Horror Movie: A Low Budget Nightmare (Australia, 2017) by Craig Anderson \u2013 out now Struck with FOMO, jobbing actor and comedian Craig Anderson sets out to \u201cnot be that person who didn\u2019t do what they were meant to with their life\u201d \u2013 which is evidently to make a horror film about a foetus that survives an abortion and wreaks vengeance on its wouldn\u2019t-be family, featuring a protagonist with Down\u2019s syndrome, called Red Christmas. Hiding behind this behind-the-scenes filmmaking documentary is a beautifully self-deprecating memoir of failure. Anderson is the kind of middle-aged bloke who\u2019s still on his mum\u2019s Medicare card, so there\u2019s a lot tied up in his valiant mission to make a terrible low-budget horror movie. Beyond the placentas in freezers, covert location scouting and buckets of fake blood, what Horror Movie really gets to, quite endearingly, is the deficiencies and adjusted aspirations of adulthood. Google Play Film: First Girl I Loved (US, 2016) by Kerem Sanga \u2013 out now The title is a nice inversion of the usual boy-meets-girl teen drama. Dylan Gelula plays Anne, an angsty outsider who falls in love with the most popular girl at school, Sasha, a carefree softballer with a conservative family. All the while, Anne\u2019s best friend and rejected paramour Clifton looks on jealously. The initial wave of tentative attraction builds, but the burst and its aftermath are more bitter and tender than the escalation initially suggests. Like all the best teen films, First Girl I Loved invests real empathy and understanding in the inner worlds of its young protagonists. Unlike most, it queers the teen drama, taking the genre out of heterosexual specifics and into more universal territory, as well as turning a first-love tale into a coming-out story. Though it doesn\u2019t scale the comedic heights of Mean Girls or Easy A, or have the satirical bite of Heathers, this is a fine addition to the coming-of-age canon. DocPlay Film: I Am Not Your Negro (US, 2017) by Raoul Peck \u2013 out 14 December The Oscar-nominated I Am Not Your Negro connects present #BlackRightsMatters struggles with a longer arc of American injustice, montaging photos of people such as Trayvon Martin with those who died in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. By setting these images to the words of canonical writer James Baldwin and his unfinished manuscript Remember This House, Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck draws towards his film a reservoir of great rhetoric, political power and emotional force. The point of its punch is clear: slavery is the foundation of contemporary American racism, and of American capitalism itself. But by animating Baldwin\u2019s words with Samuel L Jackson\u2019s voice, the way Peck brings the story together is as poetic as it is polemic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
