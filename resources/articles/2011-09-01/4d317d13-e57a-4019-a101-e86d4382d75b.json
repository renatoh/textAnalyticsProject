It will be his first on-field appearance following the off-field attention which England have attracted since their night out at a dwarf-racing bar in Queenstown last week. Tindall is due to feature in a reshuffled England side which will show several changes from the team which struggled for long periods against Georgia. Jonny Wilkinson is set to play at fly-half instead of Toby Flood, while Mark Cueto is ready to start on the wing, following a back problem. Bath's David Wilson is expected to make his World Cup debut in the front row, alongside Steve Thompson. Matt Stevens, who suffered a slight ankle problem against Georgia, is hopeful of being fit, as is the winger Chris Ashton. Delon Armitage will miss out on a back\u2011three place unless Ben Foden does not recover from a side strain. The choice of Wilkinson at No10 is interesting as Flood was one of England's better players against the Georgians. It is an indication Martin Johnson intends to play Wilkinson in the decisive pool fixture, against Scotland in Auckland next week. Given Wilkinson missed five kicks at goal on his last outing, at the Otago Stadium against Argentina, he will be keen to improve. The same could be said for the team, with management and players accepting England need to raise their standards. Tindall is expected to be watched by his wife, Zara Phillips, on Saturday. She is due arrive in Dunedin on Friday, having brought forward her travel plans after reports surfaced linking her new husband with a blonde woman on a night out at Queenstown's Altitude Bar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
