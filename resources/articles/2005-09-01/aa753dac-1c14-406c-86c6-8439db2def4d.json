Steven Bayliss, 16, was found with his throat slashed, while Nuttawut \"Twood\" Nadauld, 14, died from knife wounds. Police helicopters with thermal imaging equipment located their bodies in Bluebell Walk, a popular picnic and dog walking area, a quarter of a mile from Evendons Lane, near Wokingham, at 8.15pm on Sunday. The teenagers were pronounced dead at the scene. Thomas Palmer, of Blagrove Drive, Wokingham, was last night charged with their murders. He will appear at Reading magistrates court today. Detective Superintendent George Turner, who is leading the investigation, said last night: \"This is a very difficult and upsetting incident for all involved. I would once again like to send my deepest sympathies to the friends and families of those involved. \"Our thoughts are with them and we would urge people to ensure their privacy is respected at this distressing time.\" Steven and Twood were neighbours from Finchampstead, Berkshire, a rural community in the commuter belt. Steven had recently left Emmbrook School in Wokingham, where Twood was still a pupil. Twood had previously attended a prestigious boarding school in Thailand, where his mother is from. Friends said that she had brought him over to the UK to continue his education because she thought that Britain would be safer than Bangkok. A book of condolences was opened at Emmbrook school yesterday for pupils to sign. Linda Peart, Emmbrook's acting headteacher, said: \"Our thoughts are particularly with the boys' families and friends at this time. This is a tight-knit school and staff and pupils will support each other. Both boys will be greatly missed.\" A 17-year-old who knew the dead boys said: \"They were brilliant people, bright and fun loving, they were not violent.\" A friend of the Bayliss family said: \"I can't understand how this happened. Steven was a well-behaved boy who played cricket and football like any other teenager. He and the other boy [Twood] were always playing outside together.\" Wokingham district council also said that its youth service was consulting friends of the murdered boys about a possible memorial. Bluebell Walk remained cordoned off yesterday while forensic experts combed the area. Twood's mother collapsed in tears and had to be supported by relatives when she visited the spot where the boys died. Dozens of friends and wellwishers have left bouquets and messages. One of the tributes read: \"You two lil' terrors, you always got up to mischief and making people laugh with your stories.\" Steven Bayliss's family last night paid tribute to the teenager and his friend. In a statement they said: \"Jan, Dave, Laura and Emma Bayliss would like to thank everyone for their words of comfort and support following the loss of our son Steven and his close friend Twood.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
