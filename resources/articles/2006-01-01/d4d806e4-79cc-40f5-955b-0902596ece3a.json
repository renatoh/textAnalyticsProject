Bhoyrul was given 180 hours' community service for using the paper's City Slickers column to manipulate the stock market. His colleague, James Hipwell, found guilty last month on the same charge, has had his sentencing deferred owing to medical treatment he is to undergo next week. Terry Shepherd, a day trader who conspired with the Slickers to ramp shares, was given a three-month custodial term. Bhoyrul's barrister, Stephen Solley QC, told the three-hour hearing in St Albans his client had not been given enough guidance during his time at the newspaper. He said the Mirror's editor, Piers Morgan, should have stopped Bhoyrul buying shares he was tipping in the column. \"He [Morgan] knew what was happening, he was participating in what was happening, he appeared at daily conferences, he was excited by what was happening, he was wound up like a spring by what was happening, the money-making excitement of those months. \"He should have said this must stop, keep your information private, nobody, either you or anybody else, must buy shares knowing in advance of the column. \"Because the editor knew full well how successful the column was, the editor was taking great pride in the success of the column, as well he might because it was his idea to introduce it.\" After the hearing, Bhoyrul said he regretted not telling readers of his column about the conflict of interest between his share dealing and his role as a journalist. In a statement read by his solicitor, Miles Herman, Bhoyrul said: \"I wish to make it clear that I have never acted dishonestly, the articles were never printed with the intention of deliberately misleading the public as to their accuracy. \"My share dealing activity was transparent: I bought and sold shares in my own name using my own bank account. It's not for me to make comment about others who were referred to during the trial. \"However, the atmosphere and lack of leadership and moral responsibility whilst I was employed at the Mirror contributed significantly to these events.\" The judge told the two journalists he was taking into account the atmosphere at the Mirror in 1999. \"At that time there was no formal code of conduct for journalists at the Daily Mirror and there was no guidance from your superiors or from the in-house lawyers and there was evidence of a culture of advanced information about tips and share dealing within the office,\" he said. \"I shall also take into account the tone of headlines and parts of the column that were determined by the subeditors.\" Between August 1999 and February 2000 Hipwell and Bhoyrul operated a \"buy, tip, sell\" scam that saw them buy shares in 44 companies they subsequently recommended in their column. They would sell the shares soon afterwards, often making a profit. Shepherd became involved in November 1999, asking the Slickers for advanced knowledge of tips, then spread them on the internet and later recommended shares for the Slickers to tip. The judge told Shepherd today: \"You may have come in by accident, but you became a real enthusiast.\" Mr Solley also read from a letter written in support of Bhoyrul by Matthew Wright, then the Mirror's showbiz correspondent. Mr Wright described a \"culture of share dealing\" at the Mirror and expressed regret he had not himself given guidance to Bhoyrul. Mr Solley said his client recognised he had \"behaved extremely poorly\" by acting unethically. Hipwell's barrister, Philip Hackett QC, asked for a community punishment for his client. He asked the judge to take account of Hipwell's good character, his ongoing health problems and the fact that he had already been punished by last month's conviction. \"Financial journalism is finished for him,\" Mr Hackett said. \"He finds himself at almost 40 with the door completely closed on the career in which he had done a lot of work and in which he had done very well.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
