With other teams and other players, the fact that he will once again be playing in searing heat with a left foot that by his own admission was \"aching\" after last Saturday's match against Denmark might have dominated the column inches he generated. Instead there has been as much interest in the nuances of his haircut as his delicate bones. Brazil in Shizuoka will be 72 days from Deportivo La Coruna at Old Trafford, when Beckham's second metatarsal became the most famous broken bone on the planet. In that time Beckham has recovered from his break, got himself ready physically to the point where he was able to play 62 minutes against Sweden 18 days ago and three full 90 minutes since. He scored the winning penalty against Argentina and laid on three other goals, two from corners for Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand and one via a short pass to Emile Heskey. It is not a bad return for a player who after the Sweden game was considered to be \"75% fit\" by Tord Grip and who once again looked tired in the second half against Denmark. Beckham is getting there. In a training session on Monday he scored in a five-a-side, goal-the-winner match with a pinged right-footer past David James that had Teddy Sheringham swearing loudly. Sheringham was half-angry but the other half of him must have been delighted. Bearing in mind the conditions - his and Japan's - Beckham has had a more than satisfactory tournament. But the reports this week that his personal hair stylist was preparing to fly to Japan to refashion Britain's most celebrated barnet suggest that the England captain has at least one part of his mind on matters other than the World Cup. This hardly amounts to criminal behaviour, even if it renders the weekly Japanese magazine Myself instantly out of date. On its current cover Beckham wears a grin, an ear-stud and his blond-tipped Mohican. Myself promises \"20 Beckham stories inside\". But in flying his barber - sorry, stylist - out to Japan, Beckham has displayed a degree of brand-name awareness that would shame Coca-Cola. He knows the fuss that his new barnet will cause. Maybe \"20 stories inside\" is simply not enough. \"He can carry absolutely everything off,\" the man with the scissors, Aidan Phelan, has been quoted as saying. \"He is adventurous.\" As the popping flashbulbs that accompany Beckham's every strike of a football indicate, it is becoming harder to distinguish between the right-sided midfielder doing a job as captain of his country and the industry that is David Beckham Inc. Curiously Beckham seems to be the one most at ease with this, particularly in this star-struck nation where they would pay to watch him whistle. When Beckham turned up at Kobe's Wing Stadium to watch the Belgium v Brazil game on Monday night with a few England colleagues, one Japanese official explained the resulting fuss as \"Beckham's arrived\". It was not because England had arrived. So far, so acceptable. However, tomorrow the stakes are raised and Beckham Inc must become a subsidiary. Should England lose there is bound to be debate about Beckham's priorities but he at least is talking like a man wearing blinkers. \"I think this is the ultimate match,\" he said. \"Everyone hyped up the Argentina game because of what's happened in World Cups beforehand but England v Brazil is always a special fixture and I don't think that will ever change.\" Beckham had previously mentioned 1970 and the Pele-Bobby Moore swapping of shirts and he has probably imagined himself and Ronaldo doing the same. But it is Roberto Carlos that Beckham knows best and it is Roberto Carlos Beckham must get the better of in Shizuoka. Beckham knows his Real Madrid opponent from Champions League games. As he said of Real and Roberto Carlos: \"You play these clubs on Wednesdays in Europe. When you see these players on telly you are in awe of them. But it has helped me to play against him in Europe. I know more about him. \"When I've played against Roberto Carlos I've done all right. He's more of an attacking player than a defending one but, because he has the pace he has, if he gets in the forward positions he's able to get back. \"He can pass the ball from one side of the pitch to the other. I've had a couple of occasions where I've had some joy against him and he's had a couple against me.\" Were Beckham to get the upper hand tomorrow, then England would have a significant advantage. Beckham getting beyond Roberto Carlos would carve open the remainder of the Brazilian defence and leave them even more vulnerable to what Sven-Goran Eriksson called a couple of weeks ago \"the best right foot in the world\". The space behind Roberto Carlos would allow Beckham the room to frighten the wobbly Brazil back three. Even if he cannot bypass the athletic Roberto Carlos physically, he can do so by crossing diagonally from in front of him. Whatever the route, England need a big game from Beckham. Beckham also needs a big game from himself if his reputation as a player is to exceed his celebrity. By the time of the next World Cup Beckham will be 31 and, though his levels of fitness and workrate are acknowledged as the finest in England and mean he will still be a contender then, there is a feeling that this must be Beckham's moment to prove that he is worthy of being called world-class. Against Greece last October at Old Trafford Beckham gave a solo performance, capped by that skin-of-the-teeth free-kick that meant that the 90 minutes will be remembered for ever as \"Beckham's match\". But by the definition of one of the men alongside him for England and Manchester United, Paul Scholes, Beckham is not in the highest category yet. \"In our last major tournaments we haven't got past the last 16, we didn't even get past the group stage two years ago,\" Scholes said. \"To be a world-class player you need to do better than that, you have to go a long way in these kinds of tournaments. It's all right people talking about us being world-class but it is up to us to go out and prove it.\" Given the occasion, given the broken bone, given his effort at recovery, if Beckham can play a significant part in an England victory tomorrow, then he can be called a genuine world-class footballer as well as a global entertainment.
