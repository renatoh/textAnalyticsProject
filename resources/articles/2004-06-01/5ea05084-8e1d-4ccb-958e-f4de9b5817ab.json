There seems to be no end to the original, assertive and effortlessly engaging music being made north of the border at present. Mackenzie is a guitarist of impeccable jazz credentials who also plays Scottish traditional music. Vital Signs is the band in which he unites the two; the nine musicians include two fiddlers and a concertina player. The result is spirited, rich and surprisingly funky, with a powerful rhythmic undertow generated by the bass and drums of Tom Lyne and Tom Bancroft. In the slower pieces, fiddlers Aidan O'Rourke and Chris Stout are particularly effective, and a kind of subdued melancholy hovers around the edges of the music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
