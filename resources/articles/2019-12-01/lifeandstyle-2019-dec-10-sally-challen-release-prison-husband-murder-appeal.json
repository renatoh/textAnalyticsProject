My first thought was: \u2018Where did that come from?\u2019 It was as if she was finding her voice.\u201d It\u2019s almost six months later when we meet in a London hotel room. David is relaxed, reclined, well-practised in working with the media after two years of hard campaigning to free his mother. Sally is more reticent and reserved, clearly wary of being judged. They have spent the previous evening doing more public speaking as special guests at an award ceremony hosted by Samira Ahmed and organised by Justice for Women, the feminist group that helped win Sally\u2019s freedom. \u201cThere were over 100 people in the audience, all supportive \u2013 lots of applause \u2013 but I was still terrified,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to keep campaigning, but I think I\u2019m worse now than I was in the beginning. When I first came out of prison, I was on such an adrenalin rush. The way I\u2019d handled my appeal was by telling myself: \u2018I\u2019m not going to get anything. Nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u2019 So when we won, it was unbelievable. I couldn\u2019t keep still, I couldn\u2019t stop talking. I wanted everyone to understand what had happened.\u201d Plenty of people wanted to hear. This year, Sally\u2019s case captured the public imagination and inspired levels of support rarely seen for \u201cwomen who kill\u201d. (In February, at her appeal hearing, the queue to enter and the clamour for seats meant the case had to relocate to a bigger courtroom.) In August 2010, Sally killed Richard, her husband of 31 years in a brutal hammer attack as he sat and ate in their comfortable Surrey home. She was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life, but that conviction was quashed when Sally\u2019s legal team raised fresh evidence to show Sally\u2019s fragile mental health at the time of the attack and decades spent as a victim of her husband\u2019s coercive and controlling behaviour. Sally was released on bail and in June the CPS agreed to accept a manslaughter plea. She was freed because of the time already served. A media frenzy followed \u2013 there were emotional scenes of Sally leaving court supported by her two sons, David and James, that tearful press conference, TV and radio interviews and a BBC Two documentary capturing all of it \u2013 aired on Monday, The Case of Sally Challen was a gripping, forensic examination. Six months since Sally\u2019s release, the Challens are still fielding offers of book deals and TV dramas. But beyond the spotlight, rebuilding lives and family is far too complicated for simple happy endings. \u201cWe knew we weren\u2019t sailing into the sunset,\u201d says David, 32. \u201cWe were going to have to learn to be a family again \u2013 and one member wasn\u2019t there any more. Someone \u2013 my father \u2013 has been lost, so it\u2019s a complicated thing to celebrate. I still have love for him. I recognise what happened, but he\u2019s still my father. \u201cWe worried about my mother\u2019s mental health, and how she\u2019d cope out in the world without him for the first time since the age of 15. And then she\u2019d spent nine years in prison, too \u2013 she hasn\u2019t really been around for my whole adult life. Mum bypassed the probation service because of the time served, so there was no advice, no help, nothing. Everyone knew it would be very difficult.\u201d Sally did not return to Claygate, the Surrey village where she had spent most of her marriage and raised her family \u2013 in fact, she hopes to never go back there again. Instead, she moved in with James and his wife, Jen, who live in Essex and prefer to stay out the public eye. Her first challenge was simply getting up and down the stairs. \u201cThere are stairs in prison but they\u2019re very shallow and very wide. You don\u2019t get the exercise that you have outside \u2013 there\u2019s so much time spent in lock up, you\u2019re not using your muscles. To get upstairs in James\u2019s house, I had to climb on all fours.\u201d After the years of prison food, every meal was an event \u2013 Indian on the first day, Chinese on the second, a roast on the third. \u201cI kept saying: \u2018Mmmm\u2019,\u201d says Sally. \u201cDriving everybody mad.\u201d Being able to open a window, or walk through a door felt joyous. \u201cThat was the biggest difference. Walking into James\u2019s garden whenever I wanted. I got a car and started driving again. The family were terrified, but to me, it was freedom. \u201cI went to Scotland to see a friend for the weekend and ended up staying a week. I went on holiday to France with my brother and his wife. We rented a cottage in Brittany and the weather was awful, but being able to eat when I want, go to bed when I want, get up when I felt like it ... It felt wonderful.\u201d In those early days, for good reason, Sally\u2019s behaviour did give her family cause for concern. \u201cShe was trying to do so much so fast,\u201d says David. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a normal reaction \u2013 after so much time in prison, you\u2019ve got so much to catch up on. She would talk all the time, over everything. She\u2019d get up to clean, to plant in the garden, to find things in the garage, up and down, up and down.\u201d Part of Sally\u2019s appeal had rested on her undiagnosed mental health conditions \u2013 in prison, she\u2019d had years of therapy and been treated for bipolar disorder, dependent personality disorder and adjustment disorder. With no continued outside support, the family were left to manage this by themselves. \u201cWe had massive worries but also wonderful times,\u201d says David. \u201cJust seeing my mother walking around a supermarket felt so surreal. Getting a text from her was bizarre \u2013 then she started adding emojis and not too long afterwards, she was using gifs, though really out of context!\u201d One of the best days was when David and his partner, John, took Sally on a trip around London. \u201cIt was something I\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 take her out for the day and take her to lunch. That was the painful thing I\u2019d seen when I was out and about with people and their mothers \u2013 and I\u2019d never been able to do it myself. \u201cI was 23 when it happened, still a student,\u201d he continues. \u201cNow I could show her what I\u2019d done. She could see my flat for the first time, the life I\u2019d made while she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d And how did that feel for Sally? \u201cI was very proud,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought his place was lovely. I was surprised too, as I remembered him as the \u2018untidy David\u2019. I still think of him as a boy.\u201d They agree that, in the past six months, their relationship has become closer, more honest than it has ever been. Throughout David\u2019s childhood, Richard\u2019s abusive behaviour \u2013 his criticisms, humiliations, manipulations and mind games \u2013 created a distance, a kind of fog between each family member. No one discussed it because no one understood it. \u201cIt did separate us,\u201d says Sally. \u201cI didn\u2019t really talk about it to David because I was the parent, so you\u2019ve got to be the strong person. I remember when I was in prison, seeing him on TV speaking so eloquently about Richard\u2019s behaviour. I felt very proud \u2013 but so sad that he\u2019d seen so much of what was going on.\u201d David also regrets the fact that so much went unsaid. In the lead up to the killing, although Sally had made the massive step of leaving Richard, she felt unable to cope without him and they were back in contact. David didn\u2019t get involved. \u201cI was angry with her. I\u2019d thought she was stronger \u2013 I\u2019d underestimated the power my father held over her. We talk a lot more now because we\u2019re able to. Understanding how coercive control works has given us the words \u2013 and I know, if I\u2019d had those words earlier, I would have got the police. I could have stopped it.\u201d It is this that compels both David and Sally to keep talking publicly, as well as supporting women who are fighting similar appeals. Although Sally\u2019s case was ultimately won on the grounds of diminished responsibility (her mental health) rather than provocation (Richard\u2019s abusive behaviour) neither David, Sally or her legal team doubt that the two were inextricably linked. As a direct result of the publicity around Sally\u2019s appeal, Justice for Women have learned of many more cases of abused women who are serving life sentences. The organisation has interviewed 20 who have stories similar to Sally\u2019s and hopes to release a report in the new year. For Sally now, it\u2019s important to find a balance. \u201cPart of me that wants to keep campaigning and raising awareness about coercive control,\u201d she says, \u201cbut another part of me needs to move on. If you\u2019re always talking about it, the memories don\u2019t really fade \u2013 and there are things you don\u2019t want to remember.\u201d She is still finding her way. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. With Richard, I had to make sure my makeup was perfect, I wasn\u2019t scruffily dressed, dinner was on the table. In prison, you don\u2019t make your own decisions either \u2013 even when it comes to the clothes you wear. Now, I\u2019m trying to find what I like and what I want to do. I go to the local church, I\u2019ve started pilates and yoga \u2013 so I can manage the stairs now! I might do some volunteering at a local charity shop. I might get a dog. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll cope when I live on my own \u2013 I can\u2019t stay with James for ever. That\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m slightly worried about. It really feels like a new life.\u201d This will be the first family Christmas in 10 years. Jen\u2019s parents are hosting \u2013 and there will be Sally, David and John, James, Jen and their baby son, who was born three months after Sally\u2019s release. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d says Sally. \u201cMy first grandson \u2013 and if I\u2019d had to see him in prison, it would have been dreadful.\u201d At the moment, all family talk revolves around the baby. \u201cThe timing is unbelievable, it\u2019s like a bloody film,\u201d says David. \u201cIf Mum had served the life sentence, her grandson would be 10 by the time she came out. I\u2019d be 42. My mother would be 75. She served the right amount of time. Now she has more of a life to live and I\u2019ve got more of a life to live with her.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
