It\u2019s been memorable. Thanks for sharing it with me. Bye! Here\u2019s the best quote I can find from Di Francesco: \u201cWe started well, but we lost too many duels in defence and then we lost our heads. We were in trouble, and we lost our unity. We kept a good attitude until the end.\u201d Here\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 \u201cThe boys did fantastically well, and we go there and try to win again\u201d: For a long time it was a perfect performance, for 80 minutes or so. We made defensively one mistake, and Dzeko can use the situation. That can happen. We knew they had quality. We could avoid most of that over the game, but in that position not. Then I think we agree the penalty is not a penalty, not even a handball*, and now it\u2019s 5-2. I would be much more happy of course if we\u2019d won 5-0 or 5-1, but it\u2019s still a fantastic result, I couldn\u2019t even imagine that it\u2019s possible. The boys did fantastically well, and we go there and try to win again. You start the game, you always need to learn from the game. I thought how we played them, all these runs in behind, just brilliant. In the end, it changed the game completely. We scored these goals, we could have scored more. We missed a lot of chances. That\u2019s all positive. In the moment it feels not that positive because they scored two goals. But it was brilliant, come on. We obviously have to go the hard way, no problem with that. At the end it\u2019s hard. Oxlade-Chamberlain, it\u2019s probably a really bad injury, if we can say that already. That means a massive blow for us. We have still a few massive games to go, and the squad doesn\u2019t get bigger. We need to be creative in the next few games. It\u2019s absolutely better than I thought before the game. Of all the mesmerising nights Liverpool have experienced under Anfield\u2019s floodlights in European competition, where does this one stand? Up there, surely, with Saint-\u00c9tienne in 1977, the take-a-bow goal from Steven Gerrard against Olympiakos in 2005 and the fightback against Borussia Dortmund in 2016. Liverpool have put themselves in command and, barring an almost implausible feat of escapology, can start looking forward to the final in Ukraine on 26 May. Here\u2019s the rest of Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report: Here\u2019s Jordan Henderson: I think we\u2019ll be disappointed with the two goals. It felt as though we were in full control and we basically gave them two goals. At the same time we\u2019ve played well, we\u2019ve won the game. We\u2019ll go with a three-goal advantage but it\u2019ll be difficult, as we saw in the last round. It\u2019ll be a really tough challenge, but we\u2019ve got to be confident. We\u2019ve got to go there, put a solid display on and hopefully get to the final. We still had chances to score in the final 20 minutes. I feel as though we gave them the Dzeko goal, which caused a few nerves. The penalty I thought was very, very harsh. But we\u2019ve got to stay confident. It was a good performance for 70 minutes. We\u2019ve got to go there and put in a good performance. Some of the runs and some of the balls in behind were brilliant. We\u2019re probably disappointed not to score more. Overall, we\u2019ve got to stay positive. We know it won\u2019t be easy over there. We need to be on our best, but I fancy us to go there and score as well, with the forward players we\u2019ve got. That was a classic first leg, fascinating and often brutal. Liverpool end disappointed with a three-goal lead \u2013 it\u2019ll be interesting to hear Klopp\u2019s post-match take. \u201cIt is hard to be a Liverpool fan,\u201d writes Richard McGahey. \u201cCan we get Mourinho to be our coach for the last 15 minutes of games?\u201d The final 15 minutes was poor from Liverpool. Salah, assuming there are no injury concerns, was taken off too early, they relaxed too soon and Roma punished them. Surely, though, they\u2019ll score the goal they need in Rome? 90+4 mins: The end of a remarkable game. 90+2 mins: Liverpool\u2019s final substitution sees Firmino slowly go off, and Klavan slowly come on. 90+1 mins: Into the first of four minutes of stoppage time. Fazio heads the corner wide. 90 mins: Nainggolan\u2019s shot is deflected wide, and Roma have a corner. 90 mins: That penalty decision was harsh. The ball was blasted at Milner, he had no chance to get his arm out of the way, and there was no movement towards the ball. 88 mins: Fazio is booked for being angry and emotional. Henderson was also booked a couple of minutes ago, probably for similar reasons. 87 mins: Dzeko now takes the ball down the left and fizzes the ball in, but Perotti turns it wide of the near post! 86 mins: Now Dzeko\u2019s long-range strike dips just over the bar! What\u2019s going on out there? Perotti sends Karius the wrong way, and sends the ball into the top corner, and this tie is not over! 85 min: A cross from the left is headed out to Nainggolan, whose first-time shot hits Milner. The referee says it hit his hand, and it was deliberate! 84 mins: Dzeko has another shot, but it\u2019s weak and easily saved. Liverpool, though, are having a bad spell, and another Roma goal would be bad news. 82 mins: Wijnaldum should have scored a sixth! The ball is passes into him by Robertson, and he only needed to sidefoot goalwards \u2013 but he uses his right foot rather than his left, and misses it entirely. 82 mins: That is very nicely taken. And there\u2019s the away goal! Nainggolan lifts the ball into the area, Lovren totally misses his header and Dzeko chests down, and slams in. 78 mins: Roma know that their only chance in this tie is to score at least one away goal, and that they might as well lose 6-0 as 5-0, and are thus pushing forward. 77 mins: \u201cI backed Liverpool 5-0 at 45-1. Can they stop now?\u201d wonders Ian Bruce. Good call. 76 mins: Ings is played in down the right, and tries to cut back onto his left foot. He\u2019s been watching too much Mo Salah. A defender gets a foot in the way. 75 mins: Strootman, victim of that Lovren tackle, is limping but has to play on, with Roma having used all their substitutions. \u201cLuckily for Liverpool supporters like myself West Brom didn\u2019t make it to the semi-finals of the Champions League,\u201d notes Bryan Tisinger. 75 mins: Lovren is booked, and Salah is hooked. Ings is on. 74 mins: Wijnaldum has attempted the same clever 360-degree turn three times. It worked the first time, but not since. 73 mins: Save! Perotti\u2019s fine cross from the left is met by Schick, who comfortably beats Robertson in the air, but Karius saves the header. 73 mins: Liverpool are going to bring on Danny Ings. Word is that Salah will be the one to go off. 71 mins: Lovren\u2019s clearance hits Schick and rebounds, to his very great relief, just wide of goal. \u201cIt\u2019s partly the time of year, and the colours of the respective team\u2019s kits, but this is reminiscent of a truly sociopathic 5-0 dissection of Nottingham Forest by the home team, back when both clubs were at the summit,\u201d writes Paul Griffin. \u201cSome great, physically and mentally resilient footballers getting the Patrick Bateman treatment out there.\u201d 70 mins: Roma send in a succession of crosses, without any of them quite falling their way inside the penalty area. Still, vaguely nervous moments for the home defence. 69 mins: That\u2019s two goals and three assists two assists* for Salah. A remarkable player, and, on their day, a phenomenal team. * Actually it was Milner who took this corner From the corner, Firmino\u2019s headed bounces into the far corner! 68 mins: Gonalons\u2019 first touch is a massively overhit pass that gifts Liverpool a corner. 66 mins: Roma make a double substitution: Gonalons comes on for De Rossi, and Perotti comes on for Jesus. 66 mins: Milner arrives late to challenge Strootman, who in trying to get out of the way plants his studs on Milner. Whose foul was it? Milner\u2019s says the referee. 64 mins: Liverpool win a corner. It\u2019s not a great delivery from Salah, but Alisson comes for it and, unchallenged, fumbles. Liverpool can\u2019t take advantage of the mistake, though. 64 mins: The away goals rule means that even a team 4-0 up can\u2019t get too overexcited. Five, though, at five you can probably start celebrating. 63 mins: The ball was played to Alexander-Arnold, just inside Roma\u2019s half, and Kolarov left Salah to close him down. This allowed the full-back to volley it first-time to Salah, now completely unmarked. Another Salah assist! Again he\u2019s given insulting amounts of space on the right wing, and he runs into the area, beats Jesus with a drop of the shoulder and fizzes the ball across goal to Firmino, who taps in! 61 mins: Playing a back three gives Roma a numerical advantage in midfield, but it doesn\u2019t count for much when Liverpool keep hitting the ball right over all of them for one of their forwards to run onto. 60 mins: Another half-chance for Liverpool, but this time Roma get a body in the way. 59 mins: Roma have a shot! Kolarov passes to Schick, and though the ball\u2019s behind him he improvises a first-time flick-lob. It floats wide. 58 mins: The space available for Salah and Man\u00e9, running down the flanks onto long balls behind the Roma wing-backs, is frankly ridiculous. 57 mins: Now Lovren\u2019s long pass finds Man\u00e9, and hie pass inside to Salah is cut out just before the shot comes in. This time Salah gets an assist, and it\u2019s so simple! Alexander-Arnold plays a long ball down the right flank, Salah is perhaps just onside, and he pulls back to Man\u00e9, who has a tap-in. 54 mins: Manolas has the ball inside his own half, and Liverpool\u2019s front three gang up on him, steal the ball away and have a great chance to attack. Firmino passes through to Man\u00e9, who is just offside. 53 mins: Fazio passes the ball right into Salah, and is extraordinarily lucky that it rebounds too far ahead of the Egyptian, allowing Alisson to reach it first. 51 mins: Nainggolan gets the ball inside the penalty area, and on the far side Florenzi runs in, completely unmarked. The cross is blocked, and the ball cleared, but a Roma player had the freedom of the penalty area there. 50 mins: Merseyside Police say they are investigating an assault outside the ground before the game. 49 mins: Schick gets his first touch. Sadly it\u2019s a touch on Lovren, rather than the ball. Free kick. 48 mins: From the free kick, Alexander-Arnold shoots into the wall. 47 mins: The ball bounces off Milner\u2019s knee and into Strootman\u2019s outstretched arm, and Liverpool have a decently-positioned free-kick. \u201cWhat an appeal,\u201d says Glenn Hoddle, impressed by the crowd noise. \u201cThat\u2019s the appeal of the season.\u201d 46 mins: Peeeep! Liverpool get the second half under way and there is one personnel change to report: Roma have taken off Under, and brought on Schick. BT Sport just showed a clip of Steven Gerrard celebrating Liverpool\u2019s second goal. It\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s watching the game on the TV, when there\u2019s a big window just behind him and a great view of the pitch beyond. Liverpool had 10 shots on target in the first half. Roma had one \u2013 Kolarov\u2019s 30-yard, Karius-humbling blast. It\u2019s a \u2013 somewhat unfair \u2013 tale of total dominance. Both goals were taken not just well, but perfectly. Salah\u2019s final touches were unimprovable. \u201cI hope Man\u00e9 got a drip feed of Salah\u2019s cool during half time,\u201d writes Harry Palmer. I\u2019m assuming that Roma will be strongly reminded of their responsibilities at the break, and that Liverpool won\u2019t enjoy as much freedom at the start of the second half as they enjoyed for the last 20 minutes or so of the first. As such, it\u2019s just as well they grabbed a second goal just before Eusebio Di Francesco got his hands on his team at half-time. The defending for Liverpool\u2019s second goal was hopeless. The build-up and the finish were excellent, but Roma didn\u2019t exactly make it hard for them. 45+3 mins: The fans are on their feet, as Liverpool take a two-goal lead into the break. 45+1 mins: There will be at least two minutes of stoppage time, though given that the first of them has been entirely taken up by celebrations, there may be a third. He\u2019s done it again! This time Salah is played in by Firmino and dinks it gently over Alisson, the ball dribbling over the line and in! 43 mins: Another Liverpool corner, another free header for Lovren. This time he\u2019s well beyond the far post, and Alisson catches his effort. 42 mins: The last 20 minutes have been extraordinary. Roma, having started the game so well, have been desperate. Their high line has flopped backwards, and now Liverpool can play in front of them at their leisure. 41 mins: Now a long ball finds Wijnaldum in the penalty area, and his low, hard shot is pushed away by Alisson. 40 mins: Wijnaldum\u2019s pass puts Man\u00e9 one on one against Florenzi, with just Alisson behind them. Florenzi wins. 39 mins: Alexander-Arnold catches Strootman with an ill-judged tackle, and is booked. 38 mins: Lovren hits the bar! He is absolutely, totally unmarked, perhaps eight yards from goal, when the ball drops onto his head, and he has got to score that. Liverpool have scored one, but missed two absolute sitters. 38 mins: Liverpool are back on the attack. They\u2019ve got a corner now. 38 mins: There was an outbreak of applause in Guardian HQ when that flew in. 36 mins: Liverpool really needed to turn that extended period of dominance into a goal, and what a way to do it! The ball is won smartly in midfield and played to Salah, on the right-hand corner of the penalty area, and he shifts it onto his left foot and curls beautifully into the top, far corner of goal! He\u2019s scored another beauty! 35 mins: Liverpool continue to run at a chance a minute. Firmino\u2019s 20-yarder is saved by Alisson, then Milner\u2019s drive is blocked. 34 mins: Now Man\u00e9 does put the ball in the net \u2013 but it\u2019s offside! Milner passes to Robertson, whose low, hard centre is turned in, but Man\u00e9 was clearly offside. 32 mins: The corner is a bit overhit, but Van Dijk conjures an overhead kick to sent it back into the mixer. Nothing comes of it, but nice work. 31 mins: The last five minutes have been fabulous for Liverpool. Now Milner is played in, and wins a corner. 30 mins: Now Salah\u2019s pass towards Firmino bounces off a defender back to him, and his first-time, left-footed shot is palmed away by Alisson! 29 mins: Another chance falls to Mane! And this one flies even higher! The ball is played over Roma\u2019s defence to Firmino on the right, and he twists and pulls back to Mane, who approaches the ball at a bad angle, and then thumps it 15 yards over the bar! 28 mins: What a chance for Liverpool, and Mane can\u2019t take it! He beats Fazio with a lovely first touch, just inside Roma\u2019s half, and he\u2019s away. Off he goes, into the penalty area, with Alisson rooted to the spot. And once he gets there, he thumps his shot high! 26 mins: The night\u2019s first yellow card is shown to Jesus, whose tackle on Mane is late and ankle-high. 25 mins: A fine cross from Alexander-Arnold lands just out of Mane\u2019s reach. 22 mins: Roma have certainly been the better side in the first quarter of the game. Liverpool might have been distracted by Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s injury, but they need to refocus, fast. 21 mins: The ball is played into the Liverpool penalty area. Under gets there first, and Lovren arrives late, with an ill-judged swipe. Under stays on his feet, which is just as well \u2013 that was a penalty waiting to happen. 20 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain has been loaded onto a stretcher and is being carried away for further treatment. 19 mins: Karius got a hand to it, in fact, so that\u2019ll go down as a save \u2013 but a really dodgy one. Had that been two inches lower, it would have gone down as the most howling of howlers. 18 mins: Roma hit the bar! The corner is headed clear by Van Dijk and runs to Kolarov, whose 25-yard drive goes straight through Karius\u2019s hands and crashes against the woodwork! 18 mins: The ball is fizzed in to Dzeko, whose first-time flick round the corner to Under is really very lovely, but it\u2019s headed behind by a defender. 16 mins: The physio eventually lifts him to his feet, but turns and gives a \u201csubstitute-this-man\u201d gesture to the bench. 15 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain slides in to tackle Kolarov, but as he goes down his right leg gets caught under his body and he seems in considerable discomfort. 14 mins: Roma work the ball well from right to left, but Kolarov\u2019s cross is caught by Karius. 13 mins: Nobody on either side is getting enough time on the ball to do anything very good with it, so far. In addition, a full day of rain means the ball is zipping off the turf at lightning pace, and people are occasionally falling over. 10 mins: Salah is taken out by Jesus \u2013 who fell over into him, but still, an accidental trip is still a trip \u2013 inside the centre circle. The referee waves play on. 9 mins: Roma are seeing a lot of the ball. Alexander-Arnold slides in to intercept Fazio\u2019s pass, though, and Liverpool\u2019s break ends when Mane fails to control the ball in the penalty area. 8 mins: Firmino passes inside to Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose low drive from 30 yards goes straight down the middle of goal. \u201cHe strikes it too well,\u201d muses Glenn Hoddle. 7 mins: The linesman\u2019s spare flag is more broken than the first flag. A flag physio is on the scene. 6 mins: Firmino is played through on the right of the penalty area \u2013 he looks offside but the linesman is unable to flag due to broken flag \u2013 but shoots across goal from an acute angle. 5 mins: One of the linesmen has already had to switch his flags, after the original one fell apart. 5 mins: The danger for Liverpool is that Roma\u2019s high defensive line will tempt their players into playing optimistic long passes over the top from too deep, which will either not be long enough and be headed away, or too long and bounce through to Alisson. 3 mins: At the other end, Salah gets down the right, cuts inside and curls the ball into the arms of Alisson. 2 mins: A shot! Roma have it, with Dzeko receiving a ball from the left and laying it back to Strootman, whose 20-yarder was too close to Karius. 2 mins: Roma are playing a high defensive line, which everyone agreed pre-match was a bad plan. Time will tell. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Roma, to a cacophony of whistles, get the game started. Preambles complete. Let\u2019s watch football! It\u2019s raining in Liverpool, and apparently has been for most of the day. In as much as you can tell on the TV, the atmosphere sounds amazing. And out they come! A couple of minutes before the teams come out. At Anfield, they\u2019re playing You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has spoken to BT Sport about what he\u2019s looking for tonight: First of all a good game, and then a result which we could work with. But we cannot get a result without a good game. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s a strong [Roma] side. Playing the same system like they played against Barcelona. So, big honour. It\u2019s all good, and really exciting. It\u2019s an open game. If you go through their line-up, it\u2019s a mix-up of youth, experience, skills. If you go through our line-up it\u2019s the same thing. You never go into the game and think about conceding goals. We always play our football. We don\u2019t want to concede but we want to score, never at the cost of a leaking defence. It\u2019s April, we worked together since July. We know how we have to play the game. But in the end there\u2019s a ball, 11 players on the other side, and you have to have answers for all the things. You need to learn from the game. It would be nice not to concede. We don\u2019t think about a result at the moment, we think about the performance we have to do. I\u2019ve no doubt this has involved a tiny minority of those fans at the game, but nevertheless, this is depressing: Quick pre-match quiz, anyone? According to the Sunday Times\u2019 Jonathan Northcroft, there has been some violence outside the stadium. \u201cRoma fans have just attacked Liverpool supporters with belts, outside the Albert. About 20. One guy down getting treatment,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Roma group came out of Venmore St, and attack was sudden. Picked an older Liverpool fan and attacked him. A lot of police around but they were slow on the scene. Poor guy is still down. Horrible stuff. Roma group were chased down the street before police arrived.\u201d Here are some old friends, catching up. Salah, I note, is toting not just a washbag but an entire suitcase. Pre-match reading (5) I think this is the last of it, though you never know. Here\u2019s Jurgen Klopp on his team selection, via liverpoolfc.com: We cannot get a result without a good game. It\u2019s a strong [Roma] side. They are playing the same system they played against Barcelona \u2013 so [that\u2019s a] big honour! It will be exciting. It\u2019s a really open game with two strong sides. Go through their line-up and it\u2019s a mixture of experience, youth, skills, threat and everything. Go through our line-up and it\u2019s pretty much the same. That\u2019s how a semi-final should be. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Emre Can isn\u2019t available to play today,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cGiven that Roma\u2019s starting lineup features Cengiz Under, a Cengiz-Can battle would have brought even more symbolism to an already epic clash.\u201d And another \u2026 There are some great photographs being taken outside Anfield tonight: Roma, meanwhile, appear to have gone with 3-4-2-1, quite against Jonathan Wilson\u2019s prediction in his pre-match statistical preview. Surely some mistake. \u201cA clean sheet must be the mission today,\u201d writes Brandon Dwonch. \u201cRoma got passed Shakhtar and Barca on away goals. The key is the full-backs. To provide enough width and offensive prescence to free up Salah and Man\u00e9, but be able to limit the service to Dzeko.\u201d I think if you offered Liverpool a goalless draw now, they wouldn\u2019t take it. They want to win by two or more goals, and then pick Roma off on the break at the Stadio Olimpico. Pre-match reading (4) So Roberto Firmino, Andrew Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, all rested for the draw against West Bromwich Albion, are back. Seize the day, says J\u00fcrgen Klopp: Today\u2019s starting line-ups have been announced: Liverpool: Karius, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Milner, Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9. Subs: Mignolet, Clyne, Wijnaldum, Klavan, Moreno, Ings, Solanke. Roma: Alisson, Fazio, Manolas, Juan Jesus, Florenzi, De Rossi, Strootman, Kolarov, Under, Nainggolan, Dzeko. Subs: Skorupski, Lorenzo Pellegrini, Perotti, Schick, Gonalons, Bruno Peres, El Shaarawy. Referee: Felix Brych. Pre-match reading (3) There\u2019s lots more where this came from. Here\u2019s a live picture from outside Anfield. Scenes. Pre-match reading (2) Pre-match reading (1) There\u2019s lots of stuff for you to read while you wait for the action to begin. Here\u2019s a starter: Hello world! So I went on holiday for a couple of weeks over Easter, somewhere distant and remote, where mobile phones don\u2019t work and internet access is poor, and completely missed the Champions League quarter-finals. What I heard, though, sounded excellent. And it is perhaps those snippets, stories of ludicrous overhead kicks and remarkable comebacks, that have contributed to the feeling I have now, a feeling that can only be described as intense, childish anticipation. Perhaps the particular edge-of-the-seat, full-throttle nature of this Liverpool team has contributed, or the fact that Roma\u2019s side is crowded with players who for various reasons I rather like, or indeed the fact that Roma happen to be Italian side I have most often seen live, or that I am just about old enough to remember Liverpool\u2019s first and most famous match against these opponents. I don\u2019t support Liverpool or Roma, the last football match I watched was extremely poor and less than 24 hours ago, I am spending another evening in the office \u2013 but I am excited. Please, football gods, don\u2019t let me down tonight. Statistical pointer dept: Roma have only won one of their last 14 away games in the Champions League, but their away record in Serie A is pretty good \u2013 the third best in the league, in fact (they\u2019re No6 at home, and third overall). They have also only won one of their 19 European fixtures in England (it was at Liverpool in 2001, though it was only 1-0 and they had already lost 2-0 at home). Right then. This is going to be good. Isn\u2019t it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
