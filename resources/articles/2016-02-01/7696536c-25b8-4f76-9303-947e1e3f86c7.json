By being unable to finish David Cameron\u2019s referendum negotiations on time \u2013 it would help if they all spoke English \u2013 they also put a metric spanner into the Brexit gathering at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in central London. The Grassroots Out rally was timed for the moment when the gloves were due to come off and a handful of Eurosceptic cabinet MPs could be paraded on the platform: with no deal there were no superstars on show. That\u2019s if you can call Michael Gove, Chris Grayling and Iain Duncan Smith superstars. But beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Still, it gave some of the GO campaign\u2019s lesser figures a chance to take centre stage. And how they loved it. Each speaker was supposed to talk for a maximum of eight minutes, but the rally was already running 55 minutes late as everyone hogged the limelight for double that. Whatever else the Brexit campaign might achieve, it won\u2019t get the trains running on time. The Conservative backbench MP, Peter Bone, is a politician who usually manages to empty the House of Commons, but he got a prolonged standing ovation from people who didn\u2019t know who he was and had clearly never heard him speak. To his credit, Bone did have the grace to look embarrassed by his reception, though that could also have been due to the fluorescent green and black GO tie he was made to wear. Whoever designed that had taken far too much acid. As had the person who decided that selling GO hand-sanitiser at \u00a32 a pop at the concession stall was a good idea. Bone began by talking about \u201ceconomists and all that area\u201d before introducing Martin Durkin, a TV film producer who is making Brexit the Movie. Durkin used the opportunity to make the Bafta speech he never got to make when he wasn\u2019t nominated for his film The Great Global Warming Swindle. Thereafter it was one Declaration of Independence after another, with the emphasis on Britain never, never, never being slaves. Leave the EU and we could be guaranteed to have the same amount of oil reserves as the Norwegians or something. The lovely Ukip MEP, Gerard Batten, who recently advocated that all Muslims should sign a contract promising not to be terrorists, managed to get in a few references to the Kaiser and Hitler before making way for veteran Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash, who made exactly the same speech he has been making week in, week out in the House of Commons for the past 20 years. Only he did it much worse, sounding strangely hesitant and diffident. Perhaps he\u2019s just not used to anyone listening to him. Or maybe he was as bewildered as everyone else at having been introduced to the backing track of Power to the People. The tie designer wasn\u2019t the only one on acid. John Lennon would be turning in his grave. Thereafter things became an increasingly surreal bad trip. The 27-year-old Tory MP, Tom Pursglove, was meant to appeal to the youth vote but since he would be kicked off a Club 58-70 holiday on the grounds he was too dull, that backfired badly. Labour\u2019s Kate Hoey came up with a bizarre conspiracy theory that the reason Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell were supporting the Remain campaign was because they had been gagged. Most other Labour MPs have been under the impression that it was Jeremy and John who had been doing the gagging. As the night drew on, heads in the audience began to go down a little. Being talked at by a bunch of not very interesting people with little charisma quickly wears thin when everybody basically says the same thing. Britain great, the EU bad. Things only really livened up when Nigel Farage turned up. Nigel did what Nigel does and the people who love Nigel love it. To Nigel\u2019s obvious disappointment, news came through as he was speaking that David Cameron had negotiated a deal. It\u2019s a rubbish deal, Nigel declared, without knowing what it was. The audience yelled their appreciation. All of them had made up their minds to leave the EU long ago. Nigel did mention economics but it was immigration that got the crowd to its feet. Dave\u2019s deal had come too late to summon a Govey from the hat. Which left an embarrassing gap in the part of the schedule right at the end marked \u2018Special Guest\u2019. Step forward George Galloway, never one to turn down an opportunity to self-promote. There were boos as his name was announced and more than a hundred people left in protest. The GO campaign was finally beginning to make sense. Its aim had been to bring together politicians from across all parties and it had done just that. Unfortunately they were all ones which most normal people would go a long way to avoid. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2016 to correct the name of the film producer Martin Durkin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
