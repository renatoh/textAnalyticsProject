Spurs will plunge back into a desperate struggle for Premier League survival this week with concern growing over whether any of their first-choice centre-halves will be fit for Wednesday's crucial visit of Middlesbrough. Results over the weekend, not least Boro's surprise success over Liverpool, have hauled the Londoners back to within two points of the cut-off ahead of the game with the Teessiders. The former Boro defender Jonathan Woodgate is likely to miss that game having sustained an achilles injury in training which ruled him out of today's showpiece, while Michael Dawson cramped up to limp through the final stages of this contest and Ledley King is unable to play two games in four days. Add to that concerns over Aaron Lennon, excellent here before suffering cramp to depart appearing to complain of pain in his groin, and Spurs risk being depleted at a key time given that another Premier League game, at Sunderland, has been rearranged for FA Cup quarter-final weekend, next Saturday, much to the manager's frustration. \"It's a problem because that's another big game on Wednesday,\" said Redknapp, who could not disguise his exasperation with the fixture pile-up. \"And, in their wisdom, they've decided to fit in another game on Saturday because we haven't been playing enough recently. \"Aston Villa can go off on a free weekend to Dubai for a break, and we have the Sunderland game rearranged. We tried to get it played at another time, but they [the Premier League] said it had to be played on Saturday because they want to try and get the fixtures in as quickly as possible, don't they. It's not easy. There are injuries, there's fatigue, and we've spent all our resources. If you're Middlesbrough you must be sitting at home and enjoying every minute of this, but I'm pleased with the performance.\" Tottenham arguably created the more clear-cut chances during the 120 minutes here, with Ben Foster saving well from Lennon, and will draw encouragement from their display as they seek new momentum for their league campaign. Certainly, a repeat of last season's end-of-term malaise, when only three league wins and 14 points were gleaned from the last 12 games of the campaign, would potentially be disastrous. \"The important thing now is for the players to pick themselves up and get up that table,\" said the chairman, Daniel Levy. \"That is our priority, to end the season well. If you look at the opposition, how we performed, and the power and quality we showed \u2013 we have to do that every week. Let's finish the season well and then look to next.\" Redknapp's first task will be to ease Jamie O'Hara's disappointment after the substitute saw his penalty, the first in the shoot-out, well saved by Foster. The midfielder was reduced to tears in last season's final after missing out on Juande Ramos' match-day squad, and ended up distraught yet again this time around. \"He feels for the club, but I was pleased he got on today,\" said Redknapp. \"I've been impressed with him as a player and as a person since I came here. He's a terrific fella and a great lad, and I was pleased that he played a part. \"We have to look ahead, now. The ability is there. We've been in good form, playing well, and our record this year has been very good. We move on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
