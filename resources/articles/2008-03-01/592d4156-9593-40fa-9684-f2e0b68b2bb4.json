Milan are the latest to have been linked with the Bulgarian. \"Milan is one of the biggest clubs in Europe and if there was interest, we would discuss it with Dimitar,\" he added. \"At the moment, Dimitar is concentrating on doing his job with Tottenham. There is plenty of time until the transfer window.\" In January Dantchev stated that \"if a club that corresponds to Dimitar's class and ambition comes in with an offer that suits his current club, he would like to be allowed to go\". Berbatov's appetite has only been whetted by Spurs' Carling Cup victory, in which he scored the equaliser, and he is determined to play in the Champions League. Juande Ramos, the manager, is pragmatic enough to know that Berbatov's contract - he has until 2010 and, thereafter, the club have a two-year option - may not offer protection. Whatever, plenty of comings and goings are on the cards for the summer. \"We've got nine games left so it is definitely a case of looking at those players during that period and assessing the players,\" Ramos said. \"Then we will start to make decisions about any squad changes and any reinforcements we need.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
