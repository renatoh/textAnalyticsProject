Most victims are duped by \u201cboiler rooms\u201d, which use high-pressure tactics to sell shares to people who are persuaded that they are about to soar in value. Only later does the victim find that the shares are worthless and the sellers have disappeared. Figures released by Action Fraud and the City of London police show that 77% of people reporting investment fraud are men, with an average age of 65. The average loss is more than \u00a332,000 and most victims live in metropolitan areas. Boiler room operators usually set up sophisticated websites and often rent office space in well-known locations in the City. Servcorp UK and Regus, two serviced office providers, were prosecuted last year, under the 2007 London Local Authorities Act, for allowing suspected boiler room fraudsters to operate on their watch. The police force has raided about 100 offices in the City and Canary Wharf since the start of Operation Broadway, a clampdown on investment fraud. But despite the raids, the problem continues to grow, with reports to Action Fraud rising by 9.5% last year. Many boiler rooms also operate in Spanish coastal resorts, using young English expats to smooth talk people into parting with their money. Some victims have commited suicide after discovering they have lost their life savings. In June, Martin Rhys-Jones from Cardiff admitted ripping off 250 investors in a \u00a32m fraud operating from Barcelona between 2006 and 2009. Twelve people were arrested: four Britons, seven Americans and a Kuwaiti. Rhys-Jones, who ran a series of boiler rooms, was extradited to the US, where he was sentenced to six years in prison. DCI Dave Manley, who leads Operation Broadway, said: \u201cInvestment fraud continues to be a major threat to individuals in this country and statistics show that those who are over 60 are particularly vulnerable to this type of crime. \u201cUnfortunately, once a victim is sucked in by a fraudster, they often end up parting with a significant amount of money and this can have devastating effects on both the individual and their families.\u201d This week, the City of London police, alongside Trading Standards, will launch a series of videos highlighting the impact of investment fraud, with advice on how people can protect themselves. A specialist role is being created to help local authorities across the country take on bogus investment companies operating from serviced offices and using mail forwarding services. Jon Averns, the City of London Corporation\u2019s head of trading standards, said: \u201cWe are creating a hostile environment for fraudsters, who are duping people with the promise of high returns on false investments. \u201cOur message is simple: don\u2019t send your money to someone you don\u2019t know, for a product you haven\u2019t seen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
