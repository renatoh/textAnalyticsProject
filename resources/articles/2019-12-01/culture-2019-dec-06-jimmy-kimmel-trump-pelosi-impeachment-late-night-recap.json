It\u2019s coming.\u201d The president, naturally, lashed out at the development on Twitter, urging Democrats \u201cif you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Melania says to him I believe the third Friday of every month,\u201d Kimmel joked. \u201cFor weeks, one of the talking points for Republicans has been that Democrats are rushing the impeachment process; now, Trump says do it now, fast \u2013 a rare moment of discord.\u201d Trump \u201calso unveiled a new, new defense\u201d, tweeting that when he said \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d on his phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, \u201cwith the word \u2018us\u2019, I am referring to the United States, our country\u201d. \u201cWell why didn\u2019t you say that awhile ago?\u201d Kimmel retorted. \u201cThat explains everything. He\u2019s the president of the us! And you know this has to be true because it took him two months to come up with it.\u201d Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also recapped Pelosi\u2019s announcement \u2013 a stunning development yet still deep in the tunnel of the impeachment process. \u201cThat\u2019s right, after opening an inquiry into the possibility of impeachment, then reading the impeachment report and considering the impeachment options, we\u2019ve finally made it to the beginning of the end of the starting, and we\u2019re about to start the beginning of the middle,\u201d Colbert said. Colbert also replayed a tense moment when a reporter at the press conference asked Pelosi why she hated Trump. \u201cI still pray for the president,\u201d Pelosi retorted. \u201cI pray for the president all the time. So don\u2019t mess with me when it comes to words like that.\u201d \u201cYes, Nancy Pelosi prays for the president \u2013 and I pray for that reporter,\u201d Colbert said, then imitated the reporter: \u201cUm, Madam Speaker, follow-up question? Could I have my balls back?\u201d Trevor Noah And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined the impeachment hearings held one day before Pelosi\u2019s announcement, in which four constitutional legal scholars testified before the House judiciary committee, and \u201cmost of them agreed that DJT needs to GTFO\u201d. For example, the professor Michael Gerhardt said: \u201cIf what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d said Noah. \u201cMost of us thought that sounded powerful but Trump probably thinks that just means he can do whatever he wants. He heard that and he thought, \u2018Yay, nothing is impeachable!\u2019\u201d The three experts called by the Democrats all testified that \u201cTrump\u2019s actions were, like, super impeachable\u201d, Noah recapped. \u201cBut according to the Republicans on the committee, these people weren\u2019t saying this because they\u2019re constitutional scholars. No, they\u2019re saying it because they\u2019re drinking Trump haterade.\u201d Noah then played a clip in which the Republican congressman Tom McClintock of California tried unsuccessfully to convince the experts to raise their hands if they voted for Donald Trump. \u201cCan we just agree that people in power should never be asking anyone who they voted for?\u201d Noah said. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of a healthy democracy. There\u2019s a reason there\u2019s a curtain on the voting booth: it\u2019s so you can cast your vote in secret and then shower afterwards.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
