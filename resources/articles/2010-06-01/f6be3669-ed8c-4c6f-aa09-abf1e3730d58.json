Decisions to close local accident and emergency, trauma, maternity and paediatric services are based primarily on cuts and not on \"life-saving changes\". They are life-threatening. The Whittington Hospital, whose services were doomed by the Darzi plan, had excellent ratings on its provision. People in Islington and Camden were horrified at the thought of the closure of their local A&amp;E and maternity services. In response to the proposed plans, residents took to the streets in their thousands and signed petitions. Local politicians all (except the Tories) claimed leadership in these campaigns. And we all won! For the moment, that is. Unconsulted plans are afoot to reduce 25 different operations and 28 much-needed mental health beds have been taken away. That is why we will continue to protest. Shirley Franklin Chair, Defend the Whittington Hospital Coalition"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
