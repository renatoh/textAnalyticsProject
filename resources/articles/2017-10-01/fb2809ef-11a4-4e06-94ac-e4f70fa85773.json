The Manchester City manager referred to them as \u201cthe Harry Kane team\u201d after his side\u2019s 1-0 victory at Chelsea on 30 September and it was badly received at Tottenham, even though they are proud of their in-form striker\u2019s prominence. Pochettino described Guardiola\u2019s comment as \u201csad\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d. There is no love lost between him and Guardiola, with Pochettino even suggesting that his rival \u201cstruggles to be a gentleman\u201d when he is on a winning run and riding high. Pochettino also brought up Guardiola\u2019s success at Barcelona, which was inspired by Lionel Messi, and he noted how he had never called them \u201cthe Messi team\u201d. \u201cI know Pep very well and when he is excited, after an amazing victory against Chelsea, sometimes he struggles to keep his position and be a gentleman,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThe situation didn\u2019t affect me but, in reality, it was very disrespectful for many people. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand because Pep was part of the big success at Barcelona, when it was Messi at his best. And I never said it was the Messi team. I always said it was Barcelona and it was Pep Guardiola. I think everyone deserves to be recognised as being part of the success of the team. \u201cI think that many people took his words as very sad and disrespectful to the club. And for many players that are here \u2013 it\u2019s a strange situation. Personally I didn\u2019t take it in a bad way. It wasn\u2019t disrespectful to me. I only express my feeling that, for a lot of people, it was unnecessary to say that. \u201cWe need to move on. For me, Harry Kane is one of the best strikers. It doesn\u2019t change anything for me. And I think it\u2019s important that our position is [to] be clear, be calm, not be aggressive with our opponent. Our responsibility is massive. But I think it\u2019s important to respect every single opinion and I respect his opinion.\u201d It is highly unusual to see Pochettino criticise a rival in public; he almost always sidesteps any potential conflicts. But it was clear that he felt Guardiola had been guilty of a breach of the managerial code. To Pochettino the concept of the collective must be sacrosanct. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad comment,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThe players have laughed about it. But if you\u2019re a manager, you must show more \u2026 you must be above this type of comment. The players will not be any more or less motivated. But it\u2019s sad. A sad comment. It is not right in today\u2019s football when we want to show fair play and respect.\u201d Pochettino made the point that, when discussing the title contenders, Guardiola had mentioned Manchester United by name and then, in the next breath, called Tottenham \u201cthe Harry Kane team\u201d. He added: \u201cHe could have called United \u2018the Lukaku team\u2019 in the same way. It was very disrespectful to our club. If it was a mistake [by Guardiola], then I am more sad because he is a very clever person. He is not where he is because he\u2019s stupid.\u201d Pochettino was asked whether he had spoken to Guardiola about the comment. \u201cNo,\u201d Pochettino replied. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call me \u2026 yet. Maybe after this press conference, he will call me. I am sure that he will be glad to. I would be happy to talk to him. Of course. We have a very good relationship. We have a lot of friends. Mikel Arteta, Lorenzo Buenaventura, Edu Mauri \u2013 people that are on his staff [at City] are very good friends of mine from before they worked for him. It\u2019s a sad comment. He\u2019s a great manager, one of the best managers in the world, so why make that comment? It doesn\u2019t help him. It\u2019s not a good thing for anyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
