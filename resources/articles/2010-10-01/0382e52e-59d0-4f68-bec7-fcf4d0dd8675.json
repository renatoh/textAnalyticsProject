Heather has been reduced to occasional spots of colour, and the bracken on some slopes is winter brown. The crab apples are shedding their fruit, covering the ground with a greenish-golden hue. Ponies graze below the oaks, hoovering up the fallen acorns. Pigs plough their way through the rotting leaves along the ditch side. They have been set free to forage on the fallen acorns, whose toxins can bring death to ponies but do not trouble them. Among the dappled shade of the woodlands that make up the Hawkshill Inclosure, deer flee as we approach. One hesitates, turns back and studies us. All is well if we stay still, but the slightest movement is enough to make her melt away quickly into the flecked background of tangled foliage. We meet possibly the same group a little farther on as we turn into one of the rides. This time there is no hesitation on their part. With one glance, they vanish. Seasonal change may be upon us but there is still colour about. The heath's edges are lined with blue scabious, occasional patches of pink centaury catch the eye, and a white flower we do not recognise brings us to a standstill. Back home we discover that it is sneezewort, formerly dried, ground up and used as a substitute for snuff. Ragwort, spearwort and tormentil add yellows that appear white as the sun catches their petals. But most of all, we are conscious of the fungi. Only a short while ago we were saying how few we were seeing. Recent rains have changed that. The Inclosure holds a profusion of fungi, of all colours and tints, in an extraordinary variety of shapes. One of the most dramatic is the cauliflower fungus that is found in coniferous habitats. We came across a group that had sprung up around a number of tree stumps. From a distance they looked like large puffballs. Seen more closely, cauliflower is a very good name for them. Hawker dragonflies hunt for a meal in the insect-rich rides, and two pairs of common darters were laying eggs in what was little more than a puddle at the trackside. Unseen jays squawked in the tree tops, a woodpecker hammered without enthusiasm, and a party of goldfinches foraged in some pines. How much of all this, we wonder, do the many cyclists speeding through the Inclosure see and enjoy?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
