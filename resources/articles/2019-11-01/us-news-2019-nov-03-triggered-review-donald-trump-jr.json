In case Don Jr forgot, Trump p\u00e8re is no friend of free speech or a free press. The elder Trump has called for tougher libel laws, unsuccessfully sought to strip CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta of his White House press pass, threatened Michael Wolff with an injunction after the Guardian published excerpts from Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury, and turned the daily press briefing into a memory. Trump\u2019s dad also treated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi as a non-event and made bargaining chips of the Hong Kong protesters. Barack Obama and Don Jr get it right when they ding the left\u2019s social justice warriors for their paroxysms of wokeness. But the president\u2019s son has little to say about the sentinels of the right, starting with his father. A president who finds equivalence among Charlottesville\u2019s demonstrators, sacralizes Robert E Lee and appoints judges who declined to affirm the validity of Brown v Board of Education, the supreme court decision that barred de jure segregation, is a prisoner to the prejudices of his base. Not surprisingly, Triggered hammers away at past Democratic support for slavery but is silent over the vitality of neo-Confederacy within the modern-day GOP. It elides David Duke\u2019s endorsement of Trump and the latter\u2019s tacit acceptance of the ex-grand wizard\u2019s seal of approval. Likewise, Don Jr keeps mum over Richard Nixon\u2019s justice department having sued his grandfather, father and their business for housing discrimination. As is to be expected, Triggered\u2019s displeasure with social media is exaggerated and omits a key fact: the apparent Cambridge Analytica\u2013Facebook\u2013Trump campaign axis. Cambridge Analytica purportedly took direction from Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s major-domo, while it received a multimillion-dollar infusion from the Mercer family, the campaign\u2019s major benefactors and the owners of Breitbart. In turn, Facebook\u2019s personal data was plundered and used to help enrage the US electorate. True to form, only the Trump campaign and Russia have objected to Twitter\u2019s announcement that it will bar all campaign ads. Flogging his book, Trump Jr pulls no punches. On Twitter, he announced: \u201cGo check out TriggerALib.com to easily send your favorite leftist commie a copy of my new book #Triggered. Maybe they\u2019ll learn something. Also, What\u2019s better than capitalism and trolling combined??? Answer: NOTHING!\u201d It appears Don Jr has taken a page from the playbook of Yair Netanyahu, the son of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s beleaguered prime minister and Trump Sr\u2019s one-time political soulmate. For years, the younger Netanyahu has served as the keeper of his father\u2019s ideological flame and troller-in-chief of his adversaries. Unlike Yair, Don Jr\u2019s proximity to his father represents an evolution of sorts, one that Triggered only hints at. Don Jr acknowledges that he was shipped off to the Hill School amid his parents\u2019 acrimonious and tabloid-headlining divorce. He also touches on his discomfort with his father\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cThere was something,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat made me feel uncomfortable around the people who populated the rich circles my father lived and worked in. Even when my father would bring home a celebrity \u2026 I would run in the other direction.\u201d Left unsaid is that as a 12-year-old, Don Jr did not talk to his father for a year while his father\u2019s marriage to Ivana, his mother, crumbled before the cameras. Unsurprisingly, Don Jr goes full bore at the Clintons and the Bidens, labelling the former family \u201cone of the most corrupt and uncivil political machines in the history of our nation\u201d. Unfortunately, the Trumps appear to have an edge over the Clintons when it comes to grifting: at least the Clinton Foundation was real. The Trump Foundation and Trump University? Not so much. Indeed, as the president framed things the other day as he backtracked over holding the G7 confab at the Doral: \u201cYou people with this phony Emoluments Clause.\u201d Said differently, Bill Clinton was impeached because of his zipper. The incumbent president is in hot water for making the US government a Kleenex for his raging grudges and ambitions. As for the Bidens, Don Jr had this to say on Fox News: \u201cI wish my name was Hunter Biden. I could go abroad, make millions off of my father\u2019s presidency \u2013 I\u2019d be a really rich guy! It would be incredible!\u201d Where to start? Moscow? Still, Triggered\u2019s critique of the left\u2019s use of shaming as a cudgel should not be ignored. The fact is, members of the Democratic establishment continue to worship at the twin altars of identity politics and political correctness. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Richard Stengel, an undersecretary in Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department, argued that the constitution should not protect hate speech, which should be banned \u201cbecause the intellectual underpinning of the first amendment was engineered for a simpler era\u201d. Stengel was once Time\u2019s managing editor. Nothing like a bureaucrat who wants to play speech tsar, especially one who had previously worked at a magazine. Ultimately, Triggered is best viewed as the opening salvo of the Trump child with real political chops. Ivanka may be the object of her father\u2019s unsatisfied desire; it is Don Jr who truly connects with the party\u2019s base. His convention speech warranted the attention it received. Don Jr offers a less impulsive and younger version of the incumbent. He\u2019s a bona fide hunter and outdoorsman. For him, guns aren\u2019t a prop. In a rifle-centric party, that counts for plenty. Unlike Jared Kushner, there\u2019s a there there and he\u2019s a lot more fun than Mike Pence. The GOP has been recast in the president\u2019s image. Bottom line, come 2024 Don Jr could well be on the ticket, and Triggered is a better campaign biography than most."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
