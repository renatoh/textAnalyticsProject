The regulations, which come into force on Friday at 6pm, were described as \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d by opposition parties, which said they had \u201cgrave doubts\u201d about the competence of Scottish ministers to legislate in this way. According to the draft document, a person living in Scotland must not travel to any other part of the common travel area \u2013 England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \u2013 nor can anyone from those places travel to Scotland. Breach of these cross-border restrictions is punishable by a minimum \u00a360 fixed penalty fine. The restrictions on cross-border and internal travel are accompanied by a lengthy list of exemptions. An individual can leave Scotland to take a driving test, feed an animal or donate blood, in addition to the more usual exemptions around work, education and health. Guidance accompanying the regulations also states that people in level 3 or 4 local authority areas \u2013 which includes much of central Scotland \u2013 \u201care now required to stay in that area unless they have a reasonable excuse to travel, such as work, education, or welfare reasons\u201d. Going on holiday, whether elsewhere in Scotland or abroad, is not deemed a reasonable excuse. The Scottish Conservative MSP and professor of public law Adam Tomkins said: \u201cIs this within Holyrood\u2019s competence? For one thing, freedom of movement would appear to be expressly reserved to the UK parliament under the Scotland Act. For another, it\u2019s not clear that the Scottish parliament can make rules contrary to the common travel area, as agreed to by the UK and Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear if the draft regulations published today are within the remit of the Scottish parliament.\u201d A Scottish government spokesperson denied this, saying the regulations were \u201centirely within the remit of the Scottish parliament\u201d. \u201cRestrictions on unnecessary travel are in place in law in various forms in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland and in many parts of Europe. In Scotland they are necessary to underpin an approach that puts different parts of the country under different levels of protective measures\u201d. Regulations in place in Wales state that travel into the country from England is not allowed without a reasonable excuse, for example, travelling for work purposes. Visiting family and friends or having a holiday is not deemed a reasonable excuse. Regulations in place for England\u2019s current lockdown state that no person may leave home without a reasonable excuse, which includes work, exercise and education. At first minister\u2019s questions on Thursday, the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, described the travel ban as \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and said: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of people are just trying to keep up with regulations in order to follow them. But the best-case scenario is that this travel ban will confuse them. The worst-case scenario is that it will criminalise them.\u201d Later on Thursday, MSP Oliver Mundell resigned from the Scottish Conservative shadow cabinet in protest at the travel curbs. He voted against the party whip in a Holyrood debate on the new regulations because of concerns about the impact border restrictions would have on communities in his Dumfriesshire constituency. Party leader Douglas Ross said he was disappointed to see him go and appreciated that \u201che is only doing what he feels is best for his local area\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
