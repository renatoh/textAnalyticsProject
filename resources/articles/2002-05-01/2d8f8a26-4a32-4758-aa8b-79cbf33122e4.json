In the last 13 years I was deputy head of a large school, and then headteacher of a church school. Through this time I also raised a family and sustained a marriage to a fellow headteacher. I believe passionately in the power of education to improve the lives of people. This does not prevent me from being critical of the methods employed by successive governments who think they are achieving this aim. Having managed schools during the period of change for political expedience, I can applaud some of the rigour applied to the quality of the subjects taught, and to the skills needed by teachers. I found it insufferable, however, that small children were subjected to continuous assessment and testing requiring a battery of dubious statistics and documentation and, even worse, a crowd of hangers-on to scrutinise and consult about the process. Each part of the metamorphosis grew and grew, changing subtly each year and requiring external proof and substantiation. More and more time was needed to provide the files and files of authentication that good education was taking place. No wonder finding teachers became such a lottery and a worry. No wonder dedicated staff were exhausted at the end of each term. The audience for local accountability grew parallel with these changes. We were required to run parent teacher associations and attend a full calendar of social and fund-raising events, usually at the end of a working day. We were answerable to each committee of the governing body requiring many meetings and quantities of records. Budgets had to be balanced amidst yearly hype about underfunding. The local education authorities required paperwork for inspectors and advisers to analyse. As headteacher and special needs coordinator I had to attend meetings with health and social services people and provide working plans to manage children and families with many problems. This was all frontline action. We had to discuss but we had to be seen to be implementing as well. The injunction from the government to include all children in mainstream schools followed the pattern of \"care in the community\" - a good idea dumped on schools with no notice and with woeful funding. A major part of my day came to be spent managing pupils who could not function in a class of 30 pupils without causing constant disruption and who had to spend much of their time with the headteacher so that other children could receive their entitlement to uninterrupted teaching. No one knew how to help and contain autistic children or how to sustain their troubled, ill-prepared parents. But those children had to be \"included\" - another white or green paper from the government had said so. I could go on and on to describe the authoritarian changes dropped on English schools by successive governments. Readers who are teachers or in senior management positions will be all to aware of them. I found that to live in the days and not just work in them I had to leave my job at 55. I know many others have made the same decision. Three weeks before I left, my school had an Ofsted inspection. We received a wonderful report gaining excellents in teaching, in spiritual and moral education and in leadership. The school is one of which the community can be proud, said the report. I have a daughter who is a teacher and a daughter who is a nurse. I hope when they look back on their careers they will be able to say that the children and the patients were at the heart of any changes in their fields of work and that the governments to come listened to their professionals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
