We are the planet\u2019s greatest per capita consumers of water, with each person using an average 100,000 litres a year. Much of that is invisible to consumers, expended on the food and products we buy. Our electricity use isn\u2019t much better. A recent Environmental Justice Australia investigation found east coast coal-fired power stations \u2013 where emissions limits trail places such as China \u2013 are responsible for deadly pollution that causes a suspected 130 premature deaths a year in Sydney alone. Yet oil and coal remain our primary energy sources, powering 70% of the nation. A wiser approach is slowly becoming apparent, but confusion often reigns. So here are some practical steps on how to switch to more sustainable water and electricity consumption. Use less water at home and recycle where possible Many water-saving tips are common sense: turn the tap off while brushing teeth, fix leaky taps immediately, use a dual flush toilet, only run full loads in washing machines and dishwashers, and get a rainwater tank if possible. (Visit the Nature Conservancy Australia for a more in-depth tips list.) Choosing water-efficient appliances is important, too. The national water efficiency star-rating scheme makes pinpointing winners easier. Some rebates apply for water-saving products; check the environment department\u2019s website to search your area. But inventive Australians are also dreaming up recycling solutions. In Adelaide, Peter Cullin created The Cullector, an easy-to-install shower head that captures water wasted during warm-up time, then reuses it to increase shower pressure, saving an average 35,000 litres of water each person each year. Brisbane\u2019s Chris Murray has something similar with his Redwater diverter, and Mackay\u2019s Eric Winn went a step further. His Winns Water Saver diverts cold water from every hot water tap, which is reused in toilets or the garden instead of being flushed down the drain. Avoid wasting water in the garden by mulching and choosing water-wise plants. Some councils offer native plants free to ratepayers. To more efficiently water trees, consider deep root watering using the Greenwell Water Saver, made from recycled plastic by Adelaide\u2019s Brian Measday. Consider your overall water footprint \u2013 and try to reduce it Surprisingly, about 90% of personal water consumption is invisible. Beyond the water we directly use in our everyday lives, almost every item consumed and used by humans requires water to make. (Watch this UNESCO short animation for an explanation.) Food is the worst \u201cvirtual water\u201d consumption offender. The agriculture industry is responsible for using two-thirds of all water consumed nationally, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Livestock farmed for meat tends to have a far higher water footprint than vegetable and grain crops, largely because of the feed and water animals consume. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone should turn vegetarian overnight. But moderating meat intake and supplementing with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables \u2013 preferably organically grown produce, as better quality soil may retain more water \u2013 can help. Dutch non-profit network The Water Footprint illustrates the impact well: producing just one kilo of sheep meat requires an average 10,400 litres of water, while one tomato uses only about 50 litres. The bad news? With no real classification system, measuring and decreasing our personal water footprint is difficult. \u201cThe simplest way is to consume less. By purchasing less, we immediately reduce our water footprint,\u201d says University of Melbourne associate professor Dr Robert Crawford, who researches household virtual water usage. \u201cThis involves purchasing only what we really need, making products last as long as possible, and recycling, reusing and sharing products.\u201d Power your home with more sustainable energy Coal-fired power plants are a significant contributor to Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution, but alternatives that rely less heavily on fossil fuels are growing. The boom in rooftop solar continues, with a record 135,370 systems installed in 2016, according to Melbourne\u2019s Clean Energy Council. While high feed-in tariffs are now rare, solar can still quickly pay for itself if homeowners calculate daytime electricity use and match panel sizes to that consumption pattern. Choice\u2019s consumer guide is a good starting point, with simple explanations of capacity, costs, solar energy storage and available incentives. \u201cInstall five to 10 kilowatts of PV solar panel on your rooftop. You will save money while doing a good thing,\u201d says Andrew Blakers, director of Australian National University Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems. \u201cAustralia is installing PV and wind fast enough to exceed 50% electricity by 2030. Electrification of nearly all energy functions will follow, and we can reduce emissions by 75% during the 2030s.\u201d If a hefty upfront investment on solar isn\u2019t an option, embrace GreenPower, a national accreditation program for renewable energy sourced from hydro, wind, solar and waste. Switching is as easy as calling your existing power retailer and choosing the percentage of renewable energy you\u2019d like to buy each bill. Retailers then purchase green power on your behalf, feeding it into the national electricity grid. While end users still receive a mix of fossil and renewable energy, supporting GreenPower drives investment in renewables \u2013 a major way individuals can help Australia transition to more sustainable power sources. Other similar options include EnergyAustralia\u2019s carbon neutral electricity plan. Lower your own energy use to save money and the environment The downside to green power can be increased costs, as coal-fired power stations remain the cheapest energy source. That\u2019s where offsetting in your home comes in. Simple things can make a huge difference, such as switching appliances off at the wall, using energy-saving light bulbs, drying clothes outside and using timers and sensors for outdoor lights. (See EnergyAustralia\u2019s blog for a more exhaustive list.) Emerging technology may soon make lowering energy use even easier. The Tesla Powerwall home battery stores solar electricity generated during the day for night use \u2013 the first Australian to install one in 2016 immediately cut his power bill by 90%. University of Newcastle professor Paul Dastoor has spent two decades developing a water-based solar paint, which allows printable solar panels that could one day turn our cars and even appliances into solar power stations. And Icelandic company Janulus has launched the world\u2019s first portable wind turbine. Clean water and ample electricity are an essential part of modern life; clever and moderated use will ensure that continues at a rate our planet can sustain.
