It could be a missive of gloom to journalists on the Times, telling them they're not best beloved any more. But it's from Robert Thomson at the Wall Street Journal, even higher up the new NewsCorp food chain, setting the tumbrils rolling there. How does anyone who works for the Journal know it's bad news? Try oleaginous rhetorical excess. We've \"journeyed far together\" says Robert. We have a \"shared common purpose\". But \"our journey is far from over\". Here comes \"a new phase of integration\", a \"shared newsroom\" that puts extra emphasis \"on scoops, thoughtful analysis and deeper reporting\" via \"an editorial engine\" that will \"make the most of our peerless journalism\". We'll be \"mobilising\" joint teams, \"moving more markets, providing extra time for textured reporting\". And another team will be \"reaching out to many of you\", \"distilling your wisdom\" so we can \"take advantage of the manifold opportunities that await the world's classiest journalists and the globe's pre-eminent organisation\". Thank you and goodnight, then. Pick up your cards at the door. And don't forget to take Planet Earth's most peerless sickbag home for Aunt Alice. \u25a0 Define pluralism. FT plus Dow Jones? No. FT plus ThomsonReuters? No. FT plus Bloomberg? This would still be the burying of an independent business voice in some US corporate graveyard. The Financial Times shouldn't be sold. It should be left to think and speak for itself. It's a heritage, not a commodity. Marjorie Scardino battled to save it because she understood its value. Has her successor an idea of what such value means?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
