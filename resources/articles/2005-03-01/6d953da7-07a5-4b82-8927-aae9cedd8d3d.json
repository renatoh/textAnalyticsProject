Now it appears Deutsche wants to sell the troubled fund management business. One of the great merchant banks, its name resonant of Empire, is once again to change hands - but this time merely as a footnote to a sale and purchase agreement. Deutsche's ownership of Morgan Grenfell was consummated in 1989, just as the collective headiness of the \"big bang\" shakeup of stockbroking was finally dissipating. Morgan had made its own foray into broking: it had proved an unmitigated failure for a bank steeped in the discretion and niceties of corporate finance and asset management. The sale to Germany's largest bank appeared to provide an elegant solution to Morgan Grenfell's strategy conundrum. It had to compete in the modern world but appeared incapable of building or owning the successful broking business that was generally seen as essential to success. The elegance was provided by Deutsche's promise to retain the Morgan Grenfell brand and allow substantial managerial independence. With time, that independence disappeared. It always does. Each management failure provided an excuse to hug the British offspring a little closer to the parent's bosom. The risk, of course, was that the child would be smothered, whether by love or some darker emotion, and so it proved. Sentimentalists, particularly those who once drew the Morgan Grenfell shilling, tend to view the disappearance of the old bank's name as final confirmation of Deutsche's failure as an owner. A failure it has undoubtedly been, but not as comprehensive a failure as many suggest. Deutsche is there or thereabouts in the corporate finance league tables of deals done and clients advised. Through organic development and the acquisition of Bankers Trust it has built a stockbroking business that competes at the highest level in Europe if not America (possibly regretting that it did not buy a merchant bank with a successful broking arm instead of Morgan Grenfell). For a time, its asset management business was a clear winner in the critical British pensions industry. Now, though, its handling of its fund managers appears disastrous. Although the Morgan Grenfell name has long been stripped from their business, replaced by Deutsche Asset Management, there could be heard the last faint ticking of the old Morgan Grenfell heart. Many clients and staff saw the key to DeAM's success as being the ability to marry the customer service of a traditional merchant bank to the most modern investment practices. Over the past three or four years, however, Deutsche has attempted - in two waves - to impose management from its broking business on its fund managers. To outsiders this has appeared as foolhardy as asking Sir Alex Ferguson to direct a ballet at the Royal Opera House, with his boot-room staff as support. Internally, it has been controversial to say the least. Fund performance is off its best and clients have been leaving in droves. Relationships between sister fund management and investment banking and broking businesses are notoriously fraught. Jealousies and intellectual snobberies abound. To impose management of one on another is an interesting shock tactic, to say the least, especially if, as in this instance, an appointment is regarded as a consolation prize for an executive who is perceived to have lost out in a job race on his home territory. Those with a stereotyped view of a bureaucratic German bank might think such a crass move was only to be expected. However, Deutsche has an increasingly Anglo-Saxon style that fits with its recognition that it must diversify from its difficult home retail banking market, and with its having identified American banks as its benchmark of success. Deutsche's solution for its asset management business has an American flavour. Hedge funds, it is reported, are the future for the bank, with their high margins, high growth prospects and high intellectual content (which helps to justify those high margins). It is no coincidence that many of the successful hedge fund managers of the day are former traders with investment banks and brokers. It is easy to see how their bosses could have sold a radical change at DeAM to Deutsche's top brass. In theory, traditional and radical could co-exist under one fund management umbrella. But not if the internal and external PR is bodged from the outset. It looks as if Deutsche is seeking an expedient exit, searching for a buyer for its legacy business that will be sympathetic to its heritage and willing to pay a price that will save the bank's face. This episode reeks of ego and short-termism, but there is nothing unusual about that. Ironically, such characteristics should stand Deutsche in excellent stead in building its hedge fund phoenix from Morgan Grenfell's ashes. \u00b7 Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group edmond.warner@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
