The bill, which would have given homeless people more rights, ran out of time despite a government offer to discuss ditching other controversial measures in the bill on house selling. If passed, the homes bill would have fulfilled a Labour manifesto commitment to provide homeless people with a right to permanent housing. It also proposed criminal sanctions against those who failed to provide sellers' packs when selling their homes. In last minute political bargaining on the bill, the government offered to discuss dropping part one of the bill on sellers' packs in return for cross party support to help rush through the homeless measures. But the Conservatives refused to bargain. Housing minister Nick Raynsford accused the Conservatives of \"humbug and total inconsistency\" on the bill after the party had broadly supported the measures in the Commons. The Conservatives accused the government of attempting to bypass parliament and attacking Labour's record on housing. But the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman Don Foster joined Mr Raysnford by rounding on the Tories. He said: \"I'm so angry about it, it's an absolute disgrace. We were prepared to discuss with the Tories a deal whereby we simply deleted part one until after the election.\" He added: \"The Tories' complete refusal even to consider such a move meant that part two of the bill was doomed. This is bitterly disappointing since so much could and should have been to help homeless people.\" Mr Raynsford pledged to reintroduce both bills if Labour won the election. \"These are firm government commitments. If I retain my current post I will certainly do all I can to get early legislation.\" He added: \"When we were in opposition in the 1980s, I well recall helping the then Conservative government to secure the passage of the 1987 Landlord and Tenant Act. It was rushed through before the 1987 general election with opposition support because, for all our disagreements, we did not want leaseholders to lose potential benefits.\" He added: \"I am appalled that today's Conservative party has shown no inclination to behave in a similarly constructive way.\" Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, said: \"Labour seem to think that bringing forward a bill gives them the right to pass it without scrutiny by parliament. Nick Raynsford has made such a mess of his legislation that Labour's proposals didn't even reach the House of Commons. Now he is whingeing about his four wasted years in charge of housing.\" He added: \"Labour promised action on gazumping, but they merely came up with flawed plans for sellers' packs which would add \u00a3700 to the cost of selling house.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
