The entertainer, then at the height of his fame, was a regular visitor and would turn up in his Rolls-Royce, distributing sweets and cigarettes in return for sexual favours. He was, says Ward, \u201ca nasty old man\u201d. In 2011, shortly after Savile\u2019s death at the age of 84, Ward became one of the first of his victims to speak out. The revelation that the disgraced entertainer had abused hundreds in hospitals and schools throughout the 1970s and 1980s sparked a comprehensive Scotland Yard probe into alleged historical abuse. Savile is now thought to be Britain\u2019s worst-ever paedophile. Ward was not the only person with concerns that Maitland\u2019s work, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, would be raking over profoundly traumatic memories. In fact, as soon as the Park Theatre in Finsbury Park, north London, announced in April that it would be staging the play and that it would star the actor and TV impressionist Alistair McGowan, there was an outcry. Online comments denounced the project as \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d. Television phone-ins were devoted to the question of whether it was too soon. When it opened last week, An Audience with Jimmy Savile had already become the most controversial play of the year without anyone having actually seen a performance. McGowan admits the strength of the reaction gave him second thoughts about taking on the role. \u201cI did have sleepless nights thinking, \u2018Are you tainted by association?\u2019,\u201d he says, speaking in the theatre cafe during a break from rehearsals. \u201cIt was actually a conversation I had with a friend of mine which convinced me more than ever that what we were doing was a good thing, because she said: \u2018We haven\u2019t been able to put this man on trial. We\u2019ve not been able to direct our feelings towards this person because he\u2019s dead. You\u2019re giving people a chance to hate him through you.\u2019 \u201cAnd that\u2019s quite interesting and sometimes quite daunting. She may be right, it may be cathartic.\u201d Maitland spoke to several of Savile\u2019s victims, including Ward, as part of his research and, if the play turns a profit, a share will be donated to the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac). He also read about the subject extensively \u2013 books by and about Savile, the Stoke Mandeville report into his abuse at the hospital and police transcripts, some of which are used in the play. The play consists of a dual narrative: one storyline concerns a This is Your Life-style retrospective, featuring Savile as its star guest; the other follows one of Savile\u2019s victims as an adult confronting her memories of being raped as a 12-year-old. The scene in which the rape survivor, Lucy, tells police what happened to her is taken verbatim from an interview transcript given by a real-life victim. \u201cI just totally don\u2019t view this as entertainment,\u201d Maitland says. \u201cI view it as a dramatic form of journalism \u2026 I felt an incredible responsibility to the victims not to cheapen or sensationalise their experience.\u201d Maitland\u2019s first play, Dead Sheep, was also based on fact and told the story of the famous Geoffrey Howe speech that led to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher. But that was a comedy. This, he insists, is very different in tone and tells the story of how Savile \u201cgroomed the nation\u201d and how he got away with it for so long, his crimes shielded from view while he was feted by national institutions including the BBC, the NHS, the police and the royal family. Maitland says: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important stories of the past 50 years and impacts on all these massively important issues: the way we listen to victims, the way we believe our children, our cravenness before celebrity, the nature of our institutions. Why are we uncomfortable with it? Because it\u2019s taboo. But the fact it was taboo meant we didn\u2019t talk about it for 50 years, so it\u2019s really, really important we talk about it.\u201d It was this, in the end, that won Karin \u2013 known as Kat \u2013 Ward around to the idea. For decades, she had been ashamed of what had happened to her and fearful of speaking out in case no one believed her. Then Savile died and robbed her of any kind of justice. Today she sees Maitland\u2019s play as an opportunity for the public reckoning that was denied his victims. \u201cPeople will watch it and they might get the courage and confidence to come forward and say, \u2018Actually, this happened to me as well\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s really, really important.\u201d Watching McGowan as Savile in rehearsal is a distinctly discomfiting experience. McGowan made his name as a TV impressionist, playing David Beckham and Tony Blair for laughs. But his portrayal of Savile is chilling. He walks on stage dressed in a shiny turquoise tracksuit, a yellow string vest, rose-tinted glasses and gold rings on his fingers, hair tucked under a straggly white-blond wig. McGowan embodies Savile\u2019s physical mannerisms with uncanny accuracy. But it\u2019s the voice that strikes you most keenly \u2013 the flattened vowels, the sibilant \u201cs\u201d, the \u201cnow then, now then\u201d catchphrase. \u201cWhen you do an impression really well, you feel that person speaking through you and they dictate how you move. You suddenly start doing this thing\u201d \u2013 he jiggles his fingers as if fiddling with an imaginary cigar. \u201cIt had always been a delight [in the past] to get that, to move like Gary Lineker or whoever and not even think about it. But the first time I did Savile at the read-through, I thought \u2018whoah\u2019. It was really weird.\u201d McGowan\u2019s performance was so convincing in rehearsal that producers decided not to release any photographs of him in full costume, for fear of triggering memories among Savile\u2019s victims. A mild-mannered, solicitous man in real life, McGowan struggled at first to convey Savile\u2019s darkness. In early rehearsals, he was required to be \u201crude and aggressive and I thought, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want the other actors to think I\u2019m like that,\u2019 so I was holding back. Then I realised the only thing they won\u2019t like is if you\u2019re holding back because they won\u2019t have anything to respond to.\u201d McGowan\u2019s wife, Charlotte Page, takes on a number of supporting roles in the play, including that of a TV researcher who is verbally threatened by Savile after witnessing his abuse of a young girl in a backstage dressing room. Page says that her husband has immersed himself so fully in Savile\u2019s mannerisms that he will occasionally adopt the voice at home without realising it. \u201cHe slips into a \u2018now then\u2019 because he\u2019s had to inhabit this sound all through the day,\u201d says Page. \u201cI have to say, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re not having that! We can have David Beckham any time, but not Jimmy Savile\u2019.\u201d The intensive three-week rehearsal period has taken its toll on all the cast and crew. Brendan O\u2019Hea, the director, admits he \u201ccan\u2019t wait to escape this world. It\u2019s a horrible world to be around, I think, because there\u2019s no place of safety for the victim, in terms of politicians, police, the NHS, the BBC, none of whom did anything. The cult of celebrity makes everyone complicit.\u201d Leah Whitaker, who plays Lucy, read the play \u201cvery cautiously\u201d before accepting the role. She also asked her mother, a former social worker who used to run the child-abuse department at Rochdale social services, for advice. Since taking it on, she has found the process \u201cunsettling\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just made me feel quite small and shaky,\u201d Whitaker says. \u201cLucy has this great barrier of self-reliance. There\u2019s a hardness and a strength to her because she has to defend her position so much. \u201cI became quite guarded [off-stage], I think, and ready for a fight. \u201cI don\u2019t profess to speak for all of Savile\u2019s victims, but the reason I did it was because of the question of responsibility. We don\u2019t know if any of Savile\u2019s victims confronted him, but the chance to do that, even in a piece of theatre, that\u2019s the reason for doing it.\u201d There was a special preview performance of An Audience with Jimmy Savile last Wednesday. The theatre was fully booked. In the crowd were several survivors of abuse as well as Liz Dux, a lawyer representing more than 178 of Jimmy Savile\u2019s victims, and Kat Ward, who declared herself so nervous beforehand that she wanted \u201ca Valium sandwich\u201d. When McGowan took to the stage as Savile, there was an audible intake of breath: his stage presence was mesmerically sinister from the moment he appeared. In the words of one critic, it was \u201cenough to send ice down the nape of your neck\u201d. Afterwards, in the theatre bar, the atmosphere was subdued and thoughtful. Phillip Lafferty, a survivor of childhood abuse who has launched a petition calling for a custodial tariff for paedophiles (philspetition.uk), said the play was \u201cextremely important and powerful. It showed how Savile abused the nation.\u201d And then I found Kat Ward, buying herself a stiff drink. What did she think? \u201cI can\u2019t fault the play,\u201d she said. \u201cAlistair McGowan was so convincing I had a panic attack. I got this whiff of cigar smoke and I was sat there thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m going to die.\u2019 My heart was thudding and then I thought: \u2018No, I\u2019m going to faint.\u2019 Then I thought: \u2018No, I\u2019m going to be sick.\u2019 \u201cIt was an impeccable performance. As for the play itself, I think it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s made me realise I\u2019m still angry.\u201d After so many years of not being listened to, here is a play that finally gives Savile\u2019s victims a voice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
