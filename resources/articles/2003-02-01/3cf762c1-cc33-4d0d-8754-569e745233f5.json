Cluny Mains, formerly the estate manager's house for the Cluny Estate at Laggan, is a few miles east of the estate used to film the BBC TV series. The five-bedroom house is set in private gardens with uninterrupted views over the Spey valley and mountains beyond, yet is within easy travelling distance of Inverness, Perth and the skiing centres at Aviemore and Fort William. The agent, Smiths Gore, (01343 823005) describe the house as 'very original'. This means it needs about \u00a350,000 spent on renovation, including a new kitchen and bathrooms, and central heating and double glazing throughout if you want to avoid the full Scottish experience. Cluny Mains is built traditionally with stone walls, over hanging eaves and gables, and sash and casement windows. Inside, the rooms have high ceilings, large solid panelled doors with the original brass handles and deep skirt ing. Smith Gore is asking for offers of more than \u00a3110,000, and says this takes account of the work needed. Prospective buyers from England should be aware that once an offer is accepted, it is legally binding. This means interested parties should have a survey done before making a bid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
