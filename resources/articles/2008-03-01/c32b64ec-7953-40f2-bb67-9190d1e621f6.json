No thanks", "bodyText": "Pierre Rigal The Gate, London W11 Vincent Dance Theatre The Place, London WC1 The solo is the most demanding of dance forms. For the performer, there's no escape or chance to draw breath; for the audience, there's no change of voice, no cutting away to a new face or body. When it succeeds, however, as three solos succeeded last week, it can leave an indelible impression. Pierre Rigal is a French dance artist and former athlete whose work attempts to illuminate the absurdity and pathos of the human condition. In his last piece, Erection, in a witty contraction of the process of evolution, he spent 45 minutes moving from a recumbent to a standing position. In Press, his latest work, he performs a neurotic, hour-long exploration of the Gate's matchbox stage-space, the catch being that this is literally contracting around him. As Nihil Bordures's dystopian score rasps and grinds, the ceiling descends like some sinister industrial crusher, forcing Rigal to twist and contort himself in ever more extreme ways. This is no simplistic parable of the human spirit, however, for Rigal is the clearly the architect of his own fate. Dressed in dandified black-on-black, his limbs jerking from pose to cliched pose, this is modern man as image-slave, as a prisoner of the absurd persona he has constructed for himself. To the end, Rigal denies his character any vestige of self-knowledge and, even as the compressor extinguishes him, he's still essaying senseless new attitudes. Sheffield-based Charlotte Vincent is one of the most challengingly theatrical of the UK's choreographer-directors. She tends to use the same performers and in her double bill at the Place, she allots solo pieces to two stalwarts, Janusz Orlik and Aurora Lubos. Test Run sees Orlik dryly explaining the absence of the rest of the Vincent Dance Theatre ensemble - 'Two with broken legs ... one in rehab' - and rejoicing in the chance to dance 'without the usual things getting in the way. Other dancers, for example'. As two violinists play, he launches into an extended sequence of scooping turns and torso ripples intercut with snatches of classical dance. But he soon finds himself competing for space with the attention-hungry musicians and forced into ever-more exhibitionistic poses to hold the audience's attention. Look at Me Now, Mummy presents a fragged-looking Lubos surrounded by the detritus of motherhood: burst balloons, soiled clothes and saucepans, rubbish all over the place. Everything, that is, except a baby. So during a series of mundane domestic tasks presented as bravura performances, and interspersed with jags of quiet weeping, Lubos makes one out of wrapping-paper and slips it in the microwave. Out it comes when she's made a cake, but the birthday candles set it on fire, so she douses it, now messily disintegrating, in the dirty casserole. Vincent has long felt that female directors are second-class citizens in the dance world - left to mother their companies, never fast-tracked - but this feminist subtext never overpowers Lubos's exquisitely pitched performance or compromises the choreography's harrowingly sustained focus.
