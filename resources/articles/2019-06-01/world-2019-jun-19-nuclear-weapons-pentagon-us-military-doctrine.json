The document, entitled Nuclear Operations, was published on 11 June, and was the first such doctrine paper for 14 years. Arms control experts say it marks a shift in US military thinking towards the idea of fighting and winning a nuclear war \u2013 which they believe is a highly dangerous mindset. \u201cUsing nuclear weapons could create conditions for decisive results and the restoration of strategic stability,\u201d the joint chiefs\u2019 document says. \u201cSpecifically, the use of a nuclear weapon will fundamentally change the scope of a battle and create conditions that affect how commanders will prevail in conflict.\u201d At the start of a chapter on nuclear planning and targeting, the document quotes a cold war theorist, Herman Kahn, as saying: \u201cMy guess is that nuclear weapons will be used sometime in the next hundred years, but that their use is much more likely to be small and limited than widespread and unconstrained.\u201d Kahn was a controversial figure. He argued that a nuclear war could be \u201cwinnable\u201d and is reported to have provided part of the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film Dr Strangelove. The Nuclear Operations document was taken down from the Pentagon online site after a week, and is now only available through a restricted access electronic library. But before it was withdrawn it was downloaded by Steven Aftergood, who directs the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. A spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff said the document was removed from the publicly accessible defence department website \u201cbecause it was determined that this publication, as is with other joint staff publications, should be for official use only\u201d. In an emailed statement the spokesman did not say why the document was on the public website for the first week after publication. Aftergood said the new document \u201cis very much conceived as a war-fighting doctrine \u2013 not simply a deterrence doctrine, and that\u2019s unsettling\u201d. He pointed out that, as an operational document by the joint chiefs rather than a policy documents, its role is to plan for worst-case scenarios. But Aftergood added: \u201cThat kind of thinking itself can be hazardous. It can make that sort of eventuality more likely instead of deterring it.\u201d Alexandra Bell, a former state department arms control official said: \u201cThis seems to be another instance of this administration being both tone-deaf and disorganised.\u201d Bell, now senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, added: \u201cPosting a document about nuclear operations and then promptly deleting it shows a lack of messaging discipline and a lack of strategy. Further, at a time of rising nuclear tensions, casually postulating about the potential upsides of a nuclear attack is obtuse in the extreme.\u201d The doctrine has been published in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from two nuclear agreements: the 2015 joint comprehensive programme of action with Iran, and the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia. The administration is also sceptical about a third: the New Start accord that limits US and Russian forces strategic nuclear weapons and delivery systems, which is due to expire in 2021. Meanwhile, the US and Russia are engaged in multibillion-dollar nuclear weapon modernisation programmes. As part of the US programme, the Trump administration is developing a low-yield ballistic missile, which arms control advocates have said risks lowering the nuclear threshold, making conceivable that a nuclear war could be \u201climited\u201d, rather than inevitably lead to a global cataclysm. The last nuclear operations doctrine, published during the George W Bush administration in 2005, also caused alarm. It envisaged pre-emptive nuclear strikes and the use of the US nuclear arsenal against all weapons of mass destruction, not just nuclear. The Obama administration did not publish a nuclear operations doctrine but in its 2010 nuclear posture review it sought to downgrade the role of nuclear weapons in US military planning. It renounced the Bush-era plan to build nuclear \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs, and ruled out nuclear attack against non-nuclear-weapon states, but it did not go as far towards disarmament as arms control activists had wanted or expected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
