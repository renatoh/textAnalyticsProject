Brendan Rodgers believes the latest is the ninth injury involving Sturridge\u2019s left thigh over the past few years and, though the England training regime was initially blamed for aggravating the condition at the start of the season, it is beginning to look as if there is a deeper problem. \u201cWe reckon it\u2019s his ninth injury on the same thing from previous clubs here and there,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cSo there seems to be an underlying issue somewhere. Our medical team are looking into it, the latest scans show a slight tear just below where he had a previous injury. \u201cDaniel is very disappointed and so are we. It is hugely disappointing to be without a player of his quality. Most players you will find want to play through an injury to get on to the field and when the incident happened in training it was through quite an innocuous action. He just flicked the ball and instantly felt the pain, it wasn\u2019t a shot or anything that looked as if it might be serious.\u201d Rodgers has been investigating the possibility of recalling Divock Origi from loan at Lille early but that could not happen until January and Liverpool would have to stump up an extra \u00a33m for a striker they already own. \u201cFor the time being we just have to focus on the players we do have,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe have to make the best of what is available. \u201cYou could say it presents an opportunity for the guys who have been on the sidelines for a while. We have an exciting period of games coming up, we have to ensure we go back to our basics and be really hard to beat, we need to be strong and aggressive. Most of all we want to make an impact in front of goal, now there\u2019s an opportunity for some players who didn\u2019t think they would get a chance.\u201d Rodgers must be thinking of Rickie Lambert, yet to score for Liverpool, and Fabio Borini, a player the club tried to offload in summer, when he talks of players on the sidelines. Mario Balotelli, who has had plenty of chances, is still without a league goal, though at least the Italian is fit for the game at Crystal Palace on Sunday following the hamstring injury he sustained on international duty last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
