It exists nowadays in no less than five different editions, all of them more or less plausible. But Roger Norrington's performance, taken from a concert in Stuttgart a year ago, goes back to the first, which was completed in 1873 and sent to Wagner for his approval, but rejected three times by the Vienna Philharmonic and never performed in Bruckner's lifetime. By the time of the first performance, four years later, the work had been considerably cut, but, like most Brucknerians these days, Norrington clearly regards the original full text as the most architecturally convincing. He certainly moulds it into a powerful musical statement, complete with references to Tristan und Isolde, Walk\u00fcre and Meistersinger. The performance is not as grandly opulent as some; typically for Norrington, it is brisk and to the point, and never overwrought, though the drama is all there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
