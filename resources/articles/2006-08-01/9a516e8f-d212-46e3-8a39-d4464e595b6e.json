John Mark Karr arrives back in America tonight from Thailand. He returns to a country obsessed with the case as each day provides fresh evidence of a shadowy life and a sexual interest in children. However, there are also fears that the decade-long mystery into who killed six-year-old JonBenet may not be any nearer to being solved while the case against Karr looks far from clear cut. Karr confessed to killing JonBenet in an appearance before TV cameras in Bangkok last week. He said he was alone in the Ramsey family's basement in Boulder, Colorado, with JonBenet and that her death was an 'accident'. The news stunned America, which has been infatuated with the case since JonBenet's death on 26 December, 1996. It has emerged that Karr had been emailing the family and Professor Michael Tracy of Colorado University, who has made several documentaries about the JonBenet killing. 'JonBenet, my love, my life. I love you and shall forever love you. I pray that you can hear my voice calling out to you from my darkness - this darkness that now separates us,' Karr wrote in one email. In another Karr said that JonBenet was very close to him. 'Sometimes little girls are closer to me than with their parents or any other person in their lives. When I refer to myself as JonBenet's Closest, maybe now you understand,' he wrote. Karr had been asking to meet JonBenet's mother, Patsy Ramsey, but no meeting took place before she died recently of ovarian cancer. Other writings by Karr have come under scrutiny since the news of his arrest broke. One potentially important piece of evidence is Karr's 1982 school year book in which he writes: 'Deep in the future, maybe I shall be the conqueror and live in multiple peace.' That could tie in with a ransom note found after JonBenet's death which was signed 'SBTC'. Investigators wonder if the initials stand for Shall Be The Conqueror, or if that is a simple coincidence. It is believed that Karr has also revealed gruesome details of the state of JonBenet's body which have never been made public. Computer experts have found evidence that a man matching Karr's description was using the internet in 1996 in an effort to meet children for sex. In one posting on a website a man called John Karr and whose date of birth matches Karr's asked: 'Is sex among people under 10 a rarity or commonplace?' Certainly the picture emerging of Karr is disturbing. He was investigated five years ago in California on child pornography charges. Officials involved in that inquiry revealed that at the time they believed he may have had a link to the JonBenet case. After being charged Karr skipped bail and disappeared until his fresh arrest. It has also emerged that Karr had become fascinated with another high- profile child killing, that of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, who was murdered in California in 1993. He told police in 2001 that he was researching a book about Klaas's killer, Richard Allen Davis, who is on death row for the crime. However, there is no evidence of any communication between Karr and Davis. That unusual interest in famous child-killing cases may have sounded alarm bells in the team investigating JonBenet's murder. The flurry of media attention in the days since Karr's arrest has raised suspicions that he may be a mentally-disturbed obsessive seeking attention. His ex-wife, Lara Knutson, who has publicly stated her dislike for Karr, has said she believes she remembers spending the Christmas of 1996 - when JonBenet was killed in Colorado - with Karr and their three sons in Alabama, many hundreds of miles away. Knutson is now working with the police to see if she can find photographs to back up - or refute - her memory. Experts have also said Karr's handwriting does not match the ransom note. Officials in the case are keeping tightlipped about what other evidence they may have. They have stressed that all suspects are innocent until proven guilty. That has led some media commentators to go public with their belief that Karr is a fantasist seeking attention for a crime he did not commit. 'Karr may be crazy but he's not the right man,' read one headline in the Rocky Mountain News. Soon, however, investigators may have their answer. It is believed that DNA evidence from an unknown individual was left on JonBenet's body. When Karr steps off his flight he will almost certainly give a DNA sample. If that matches then investigators will conclude they have found the killer. If it does not, then their case could collapse, despite Karr's insistence that he murdered JonBenet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
