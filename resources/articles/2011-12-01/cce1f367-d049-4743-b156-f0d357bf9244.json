You can order them online or, if you're in and around London, they sell them at Whole Foods, too, though I always find it hard to choose from all the different flavours. Athene Greig London SE24 I love visiting Heselden Hats in Faversham, Kent, for a great browse of the great miscellany of toys, china, scarves, jewellery and, of course, hats of every colour, type and price. And it's the only shop I know where you get offered a cup of tea. Jenny Loudon Rochester, Kent While searching for some more unusual stocking fillers, I came across some unique jewellery and art pieces at Pay My Rent. Priced very reasonably, they are all one of a kind and the maker also takes commissions for custom pieces. Karen Wright Hove, East Sussex All My Finds make customised vintage party dresses, perfect for New Year's Eve. Each one is totally unique and very sensibly priced. Great for getting something a little bit different for the party season. Christina Sanders London WC1 \u2022 Tell us what you like \u2013 email what.i.like@theguardian.com.
