The director of the Gateshead gallery, Sune Nordgren, has been hauled over the coals in a confidential but recently leaked Arts Council of England report. \"Breaches of regulations\" approaching \"financial irregularity\" were mentioned; there had been a \"breakdown in communication and cooperation ... within the management team\". Meanwhile, a stiff letter to Baltic's chairman from ACE chief executive Peter Hewitt talked of \"insufficient financial control, inadequacies in financial procedures, inadequate staffing in finance and problems with top-level management and board supervision\". According to Nordgren, his deputy in charge of financial matters resigned 18 months ago for \"personal reasons\", and the post in the meantime has been filled by temporaries. \"It's been a mess,\" he says. His financial manager has been \"firefighting\" (perhaps in more ways than one, since the official opening last July was disturbed by a fire alarm), and the technical staff absorbed in dealing with the massive number of visitors. For Baltic has been overwhelmingly successful. From Chris Burden's Meccano bridges last summer to the current show of Sigurdur Gudmundsson's oversize fetishistic chocolates, the gallery has been bringing surprising, truly international exhibitions to an eager public - around 1,000 people a day. Baltic reached its projected annual visitor figures after six months - a demonstration of the vigour of artistic life beyond Britart and beyond London. This combination of financial foundering and artistic success sums up the challenge of running an arts organisation. Which do you put first: the art or the accounts? Given that it is tough to find curators, opera administrators or artistic directors who are as good at managing as they are at having creative ideas, who do you put in charge: a bean counter who can balance the books, or the visionary with no head for figures? The issue is particularly tricky for vast outfits such as the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, where the bureaucracy - huge staffs, massive buildings to keep up (or tear down, in the case of the RSC), fundraising on a major scale - can easily suck you in. The answer, every time, is to put the creative people at the top, and let the buck stop with them. Give them their heads, free them from political agendas, don't force them to render down what they are doing to some apparently crowd- pleasing, acceptable sludge. For in the end, punters are - surprise! - drawn to quality, not necessarily \"safe bets\". The greatest successes can arise from taking risks that managers in business would find unacceptable - which can sometimes involve splashing out on something unlikely, untested, original. Think of publicly funded theatre: its biggest variable in income is not its subsidy, nor its private donations, but its box office. And the person who comes up with the brilliant hit show that will stave off disaster isn't going to be the bean counter. Over at ACE, Hewitt said this week: \"Yes, there were major problems at Baltic, and we stepped in. But they did energetically address what we said to them.\" Nordgren sounds less cavalier and more chastened than he did six months ago, and has started peppering his conversation with ACE-acceptable phrases such as \"education projects\". Advice for Nordgren: appoint someone you can trust to manage the gallery, make sure they trust you, then get on with putting on brilliant art. Take the credit when it goes right, but don't forget: you will be the one responsible if Baltic slides into financial turmoil. And none of us wants that. \u00b7 Tate Britain's new exhibition, Constable to Delacroix: British Art and the French Romantics, devotes a fair proportion of its space to G\u00e9ricault's masterpiece, The Raft of the Medusa. Indeed, a room has been converted, at some expense, to accommodate the canvas. But lo! As one approaches the great work, one cannot help but notice that The Raft of the Medusa is not, in fact, The Raft of the Medusa; rather, it is a mid-19th-century copy by two gentlemen rejoicing in the names of Pierre-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Guillemet and Etienne-Antoine-Eug\u00e8ne Ronjat. The real Raft, it seems, is too frail to travel. Kept you on your toes, though, didn't it? This could start a trend: the RSC's King Lear without King Lear; The Hours sans Virginia Woolf and nose; and the new, improved National Gallery's Titian show, minus any Titian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
