The schoolboy, from West Bromwich in the West Midlands, burst into a store in the town armed with the 12-bore gun, Wolverhampton crown court heard. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to charges of attempted robbery and possession of a firearm with intent. Judge Robin Onions told the teenager - who was just 12 at the time of the offence on May 8 this year - that he would have been sent to jail if he had been older. Sentencing the boy, the judge said that staff at the Your Own Shop on Oak Lane had been terrified by their 20-minute ordeal, but had shown remarkable bravery throughout. The boy, who sobbed when a letter he wrote apologising for his actions was read to the court by his defence counsel, Elizabeth Norman, was ordered to remain indoors between 7pm and 7am for the next three months. He will also be electronically tagged and subjected to 24-hour monitoring by a youth offending team. Describing the manner of the offence as childish in nature, the judge told the boy: \"I am dealing with a truly exceptional case, given your age. In your case, the demands of rehabilitation are far greater than the need to punish. I take the view that you didn't understand the true extent, the gravity, of what you had done. \"Society will be better served if you receive supervision and surveillance.\" The judge added that there was every reason to hope that the youth would learn from what he had done and go on to become a useful member of society. The court was told that the offender, who claimed to have found the weapon at the home of a family friend, was preparing to start classes at a new school. He is said to have kept the weapon for three weeks prior to the robbery, which happened after he was \"dared\" to commit the crime by a relative. A police inquiry is continuing to establish exactly how the weapon came into the boy's possession. The judge warned the teenager that the offence was \"not glamorous\" and that any breach of the order would result in him being brought back to the same court. \"Boys of your age should be off playing football rather than doing what you have done,\" he added. Earlier, the court was told that the hooded raider had walked into the shop and pulled out the 12-bore shotgun, which was unloaded, from under his jacket. Jasbir Gulliani and his father, Sudha, managed to keep him talking until police marksmen arrived and disarmed him. Closed circuit television footage of the incident was shown a fortnight ago during the earlier hearing. During the raid, the boy was told that there was no cash in the till and that he was too young to smoke. The court heard that he threw a bin bag at Mr Gulliani, ordering him to fill it with cash, but that the shopkeeper refused. Speaking outside the court, Detective Inspector Carl Southwick, of West Bromwich police, said the sentence was fair, as the youngster had been \"egged on\" by others to hold up the store."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
