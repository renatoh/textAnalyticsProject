Beckham, one of the ambassadors for the Football Association's bid, has been following the investigations into the voting process, as well as the inquiry that has led to the former Fifa presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam being banned from football from life. Bin Hammam is appealing against that ruling. His analysis is that \"there is obviously something wrong\" at Fifa, but he does not believe there is any way the decisions to award the tournament to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022 will be overruled. \"It gives you a real sick feeling,\" he said. \"So much hard work went into that bid. \"Nobody could have done any more, genuinely, and then you factor in that we also had the weight of the prime minister and the future king of England behind us. It doesn't get much bigger than that. So the situation we see now \u2026 it leaves a sick feeling in your mouth.\" In an interview in today's Guardian, in which he also discusses his retirement and his hope of representing Team GB at the London Olympics, Beckham says he was certain Russia and Qatar would guarantee \"spectacular tournaments\" but he remains suspicious of Fifa's voting system. \"There was obviously something wrong with the system when you look at the investigations since the vote and some of the things that have come out. At the time, you don't suspect it. When people tell you to your face that you have got their vote, you want to believe them. Then the vote happens and yeah, you start to think, 'This is a little bit weird.' \"It just felt unfair. The decisions have been made and, whether they can be changed, I've no power over that.\" On London 2012, which move into its final year of preparations on Wednesday, Beckham adds: \"I'd love to be involved and, for that to happen, I still have to be playing by then.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
