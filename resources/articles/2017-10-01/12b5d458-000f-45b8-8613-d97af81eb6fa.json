Doctor Richard Freeman, who worked for both Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2015, has walked away from his position without a pay-off. He is understood to be unwell and did not feel able to face disciplinary action from British Cycling for his failure to keep proper medical records. Freeman has not spoken publicly since UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) launched an investigation more than a year ago into the contents of a Jiffy bag delivered to Wiggins at the 2011 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. In a written statement to a parliamentary hearing, Freeman insisted the package contained only the decongestant Fluimucil but Ukad has still not been able to verify that claim because of the lack of medical records. It is understood he was due to speak to Ukad as part of its continuing investigation two weeks ago but was not well enough to do so. British Cycling, which parted company with Freeman on 2 October, insisted it would continue to co-operate with the Ukad investigation. Freeman\u2019s resignation removes an uncomfortable link with it and the doping suspicions swirling round Team Sky. Harrington, who took over from Ian Drake as chief executive of British Cycling in May, said she would have preferred to bring the matter to a more solid conclusion. \u201cWe were investigating him on employment matters and Ukad were investigating him on doping matters,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter some months we were ready to continue with disciplinary action. Dr Freeman really wasn\u2019t well enough to commence that and so we\u2019ve allowed him to resign. \u201cWe continue to support Ukad and when Dr Freeman is better I would hope he would continue to support Ukad with any ongoing investigation. It is an area that for the sake of our current riders, membership and reputation of our sport, that I would have hoped to have brought to a tidier end, but we also have a duty of care to him as an employee.\u201d In 2011, medicine for both Team Sky and the GB cycling team was stored at the National Cycling Centre in Manchester. Team Sky have struggled to properly explain why large quantities of triamcinolone, the controversial drug taken by Wiggins before his 2012 Tour de France victory, was ordered, nor account for a delivery of testosterone patches. The former clinical director Dr Steve Peters has said the patches were delivered in error by a medical supplier. Riders have privately described Freeman\u2019s former medical room inside the cycling centre as \u201cchaotic\u201d, with piles of papers stacked up and no obvious filing system. Freeman admitted he relied on his own note-keeping, finding Dropbox \u2013 a file-sharing system used by other Team Sky doctors \u2013 \u201cdifficult to use\u201d. But he claimed the laptop on which he kept his notes was later stolen while he was on holiday in Greece. Harrington, who was previously group operations director at the Football Association, said she worried that any British rider suspected of doping in future could have their reputation tarnished by Freeman\u2019s failure to keep proper records. \u201cAm I happy records were being kept as good as they could be in order to protect the reputations of our riders, as well as proving no wrongdoing? No I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I worry something could come up from the past? As chief exec of cycling\u2019s national governing body, of course I do. \u201cI want our employees to sit around their respective dinner tables in the evening proud of where they work and not have anything hanging over them. What is within my sphere of influence is making sure we\u2019re not just fit for purpose but setting a benchmark for what medical governance should look like. \u201cIn February Jonathan Browning took over as chairman and had already commissioned a report on our medical governance. Change starts at the top so you\u2019ve got to have the right leadership but you\u2019ve also got to have the right processes and systems in place to ensure there\u2019s no oversight, and an evidence trail so if something goes wrong you can find out where it\u2019s failing. You\u2019ve got to have the ability to defend your clean riders.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
