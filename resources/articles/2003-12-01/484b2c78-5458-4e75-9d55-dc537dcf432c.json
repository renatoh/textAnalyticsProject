Competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the European Commission was close to finalising its objections to the current deal, which was announced in August and saw Sky maintaining its near-exclusive grip on live football in Britain. The commission is expected to write to the Premier League in the next few days to outline its outstanding concerns. The pay-TV giant paid \u00a31.024bn for the rights to 138 live games a season from next year and further enraged Brussels' competition chief, Mario Monti, by then scooping the rights to delayed live broadcasts and internet footage. \"This is bad for competition on broadcasting markets and it is bad for consumers,\" Mr Monti declared in October. Since then, the commission has been finalising a new \"statement of objections\" into the way that the Premier League sold the rights. The Premier League maintains it has co-operated with the EC all the way through the bidding process, and is prepared to go to court if necessary to protect its existing deal. A League spokesman said it was still negotiating with the EC and remained \"hopeful of a satisfactory outcome\". It has argued that live rights were put out to tender but that Sky easily outbid the competition and that it was entitled to go with the highest bidder as long as it was a fair and open process. Under pressure from Brussels, the League increased the number of live packages on offer from two to four - but BSkyB still scooped the lot by outbidding its cash-strapped competitors. If the EC insists the rights be re-tendered in an effort to redistribute them to more than one broadcaster, it would hit clubs hard because they have already started planning based on the windfall they expect to get from Sky next season. Premier League officials and MPs have spent the last two months furiously lobbying EC officials in a bid to diffuse the row. If the broadcaster is forced to give up its jealously guarded exclusive rights, it would expect to pay substantially less. In the past two weeks media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who owns a 35.4% stake in BSkyB, and BBC director general Greg Dyke have spoken out against the EC's involvement. Mr Murdoch said if the deal was blocked \"you are going to see more than half the football clubs in Britain go broke\" while Mr Dyke said at the weekend that he believed the commission would succeed in breaking Sky's monopoly. \"I think the European Commission will break up the Sky monopoly on sport. And, when they do that, if they [Sky] don't give notice, half the football clubs will go bust,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph. The former Manchester United director predicted the EC's decision would start a chain reaction which would lead to top clubs eventually selling their own television rights, a move that would further hurt smaller Premier League clubs who are guaranteed a certain number of TV appearances under the existing system. \"I think some of the big clubs will decide to sell their own [rights]. Not this time, but next time. At some stage pay per view will transform football,\" he said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
