They have some of the most intriguing names of all the wild flowers, such as butterfly orchid, frog orchid and bird's-nest orchid. The butterfly orchid resembles, with some stretch of the imagination, a butterfly and it is unusual in that it glows in the dark to attract night flying moths that are its pollinators. The frog orchid also gets its name from the shape of its flowers while the bird's-nest orchid is so-called because of the way that its root system resembles the nest of a wood pigeon. It was an orchid's name that last weekend attracted me to the coastal site of Ardersier, just east of Inverness. The quarry was the coralroot orchid and the name is derived from the underground stem that is said to be coral like. It proved to be a long search for the orchid but there was plenty of other wildlife of interest, and by coincidence what stole the show was another orchid, the northern marsh orchid. This is a very dark purple colour and, as usual, I could not stop photographing them as they are one of my favourite orchids. Then there was the bonus that came into view as I laid prostrate studying the image of the orchid on the camera screen. Suddenly, there in the viewfinder, was a six-spot burnet moth on the orchid blossoms. The blackish wings with their six red wing blotches seemed to accentuate the purple of the orchids and I was spellbound. There was something about this combination of the small day flying moth and the orchid that gave me indescribable fascination. In the end I did find the coralroot orchid and, although their blossoms had gone over, it was interesting to see the reddish stems characteristic of where this orchid grows, on sand dunes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
