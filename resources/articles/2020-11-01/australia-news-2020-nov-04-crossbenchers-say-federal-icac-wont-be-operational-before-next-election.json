The government is facing early and heated criticism from the crossbench for its draft Commonwealth Integrity Commission model, including from Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick, and Centre Alliance\u2019s Stirling Griff, who could play a crucial role in its passage through the Senate. The Coalition released the draft legislation this week, almost two years after it began preparatory work. It has sat on the draft for months, blaming the pandemic, and missed repeated self-imposed deadlines to produce the document. The draft prompted renewed criticism over the proposed commission\u2019s inability to hold public hearings into government corruption, its reliance on a narrow definition of corruption, the lack of any power to make corruption findings, and the high threshold required for investigations to begin. The government\u2019s proposal is now out for consultation for six months until March. But senators Patrick and Griff have both warned it is unlikely the commission will be operational in time for the 2022 election, as has the Greens leader in the Senate, Larissa Waters. Patrick, an independent, said the legislation would need to be redrafted following consultation. It would then need to be introduced to the House, go through a Senate committee process, and then be passed through the Senate, all before work actually begins in hiring staff and selecting commissioners. \u201cI\u2019m of the view that the timeframe is deeply disappointing,\u201d Patrick told the Guardian. \u201cWe won\u2019t see an Icac set up this side of the election, because it\u2019s not just the six-month consultation.\u201d Griff said the draft bill would require \u201csignificant review and consultation\u201d before Centre Alliance locked in its final position. \u201cIt is out for six months of consultation, so it won\u2019t see the light of day until next year at the earliest and given it has taken two years to get to this stage, I doubt it will even be introduced this side of the next election.\u201d Waters, also the Greens\u2019 democracy spokeswoman, said the \u201ctoothless\u201d commission ignored key concerns raised in earlier consultation, and appears designed simply to delay the creation of a genuine corruption watchdog. \u201cEven if the Coalition gets the votes it needs to pass this sham Icac, I don\u2019t see it being set up before the next election,\u201d she said. \u201cMy bill for a federal watchdog with teeth passed the Senate last year. If the government called it on for a vote, concerns could be addressed and we could see an integrity commission in place by the end of the year. But this government will pull every trick in the book to avoid cleaning up its sideshow of scandals.\u201d Lambie is also strongly opposed to what she sees as a weak commission model. She told the Guardian that the government appeared to be engineering a situation from which it could blame the crossbench and opposition for the legislation\u2019s eventual failure. \u201cIf the attorney general was serious about political corruption, he would put forward a serious bill on Icac,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want this to pass. The Liberals won\u2019t add the amendments that are needed to strengthen the bill, then they\u2019ll blame the crossbench, Greens and Labor for not putting the bill through because the LNP doesn\u2019t want to ever be put under the microscope for political corruption.\u201d It\u2019s a view shared by Waters. \u201cThe government knows its model doesn\u2019t meet the minimum standards demanded by experts, the public and the crossbench,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sham Icac is about politics, not policy. It\u2019s designed to fail and for that failure to be blamed on those demanding a watchdog with actual teeth.\u201d The attorney general, Christian Porter, said he would be \u201cconsulting closely with crossbench members over the coming months\u201d, noting their role would be critical to the passage of the complex and detailed legislation. \u201cThat means listening to them and considering their views, but also trying to convince them that the model we have put forward is the fairest and most balanced approach, given the extraordinary coercive and investigative powers that the new body will hold,\u201d Porter said. But Porter said it would be disappointing if the crossbench were \u201cso wedded to particular controversial ideas\u201d, including the need for full public hearings or full retrospectivity, that they would block the passage of the legislation, which was already fully funded. The Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie said it would be \u201cpretty disappointing\u201d if the government did not create a well-funded anti-corruption body with \u201cwide-ranging ability to take referrals\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously hoping for elements of the Helen Haines bill and will look to include some of those measures. Retrospectivity is important.\u201d Sharkie queried \u201cwhat is the point of consultation if the government is not open to amendments\u201d, after Porter said there were \u201ccertain matters of principle\u201d on which it won\u2019t compromise. On public hearings, Sharkie said a model where the commission can hold \u201cprivate and or public hearings\u201d offers the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d \u2013 a repudiation of the government model for private hearings only into public sector integrity issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
