Known in recent years for reports from locations including Syria, Myanmar and North Korea, she had won plaudits for courageous reporting to expose human rights abuses. Colleagues on Tuesday paid tribute to the investigative journalist and television reporter, who died aged 64, and who underwent chemotherapy following her diagnosis and had a stem cell transplant in July. Lloyd-Roberts died on Tuesday evening at University College Hospital, London, following complications from the transplant, the BBC reported. BBC director general Tony Hall said: \u201cSue Lloyd-Roberts was a pioneer video journalist. \u201cHer determination, bravery and courage were extraordinary. \u201cShe went to dangerous places to give a voice to people who otherwise would not be heard. She was quite simply a remarkable woman who got remarkable stories. She will be deeply missed.\u201d She was described as \u201cone of greatest TV reporters of our time\u201d by Michael Crick, political correspondent at Channel 4 News, who said that she was a \u201ccourageous, fearless fighter for human rights\u201d. Others recalling her work included BBC\u2019s chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, who described her as the \u201cbravest of journalists, kindest of colleagues, wonderful person\u201d. She added: \u201cSue Lloyd-Roberts was a trail blazer \u2013 taking risks, showing courage, telling the stories few others could get.\u201d A former colleague on BBC Newsnight, Paul Mason, described her as \u201ca superb journalist and human being\u201d. Sky News presenter Kay Burley paid tribute to \u201ca magnificent woman and journalist\u201d, while Jane Garvey said Lloyd-Roberts was a \u201cwonderful woman, brilliant journalist\u201d. She was married to BBC producer Nick Guthrie. The couple had been living in Spain, where they ran a rural hotel. A correspondent for BBC News, Lloyd-Roberts had run a public appeal after her diagnosis to find a donor and had been keeping a video diary of her struggle for the BBC. In her final blog entry, from 21 August, she said she had pneumonia and was confined to bed. She said: \u201cOn the brighter side I am enjoying being totally infantised. A few nights ago I had this surreal experience of complete role reversal between me and my son. As George was trying to put a forkful of food in my mouth, he circled the fork like a plane and said, \u2018Come on, open up, we\u2019re coming in to land\u2019 which is exactly what I would do to him 33 years ago ... So, I\u2019m being fed and read to and nurtured and given loads of love from my family. All of which is keeping me going.\u201d Lloyd-Roberts \u2013 who had also worked for ITN \u2013 reported on events in Syria, Myanmar and North Korea and campaigned for human rights. Other notable pieces of journalism by her included coverage of the impact of female genital mutilation. She was awarded an MBE and CBE for her services to journalism, while her reporting from North Korea won an Emmy and she was also given a European Women of Achievement award. Others who paid tribute to her on Tuesday night included Jeremy Bowen, the BBC\u2019s Middle East editor, who tweeted: \u201cVery sorry to hear that Sue Lloyd-Roberts has died. She was a brilliant and indefatigable journalist. Condolences to Nick &amp; rest of family.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
