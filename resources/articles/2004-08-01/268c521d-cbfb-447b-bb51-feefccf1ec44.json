Spurs have already made a \u00a34m offer for Wright-Phillips, to which Manchester City responded by insisting the player is not for sale. The winger is currently in talks over extending his contract, which has two years to run. But Spurs are not deterred and hope to secure him in time for him to be available for Saturday's game with Liverpool. Ironically, Liverpool are also interested in Wright-Phillips while Sir Alex Ferguson is understood to have requested first option on the player from his side's city rivals. But Spurs has its own allure for Wright-Phillips. His former England Under-21 colleague Jermain Defoe is his best friend and would attempt to persuade him to swap the north-west for a return to his home town. Spurs are understood to have had an approach for Jason Euell snubbed yesterday, with the midfielder ready to extend his Charlton contract. That is expected to prompt a move for West Ham's \u00a33.5m midfielder Michael Carrick, though no inquiries have yet been lodged from White Hart Lane. Portsmouth still hope to land the 23-year-old, with West Bromwich declaring their interest yesterday after the collapse of Arsenal's negotiations with Carrick. Danny Murphy yesterday described Charlton as a better team, and a more stable and potentially bigger club than Tottenham, as he explained why he turned down Spurs to move to The Valley from Liverpool for \u00a32.5m. \"With Alan [Curbishley] in charge I think they can definitely keep progressing and become as big, if not bigger, than Tottenham,\" said the midfielder, who was followed into Charlton last night by Francis Jeffers as the striker made a \u00a32.6m move from Arsenal. Paolo di Canio, meanwhile, left Charlton last night to join Lazio on a free transfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
