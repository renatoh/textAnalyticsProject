The new series of The Apprentice (Wed, 9pm, BBC1) is the best ever! Probably! I haven't seen it yet! No, really, I haven't. Here's a fascinating glimpse behind the Screen Burn curtains: usually, when I want to write about an upcoming show, I phone the press department for the relevant channel and ask for a preview DVD. Simple. But The Apprentice has become so sparkly and important, rather than relying on the BBC press lot, a fancy external PR company has been brought in to orchestrate a brilliant publicity campaign. Since this is precisely the sort of task Sir Alan sets his buzzword-spouting tit head contestants each week, let's judge their efforts on the same ruthless basis. Instead of simply sending out preview copies, they've arranged an exclusive press screening at the London Stock Exchange, attended by Sir Alan himself, which is scheduled to commence at 10.30 in the morning, precisely half an hour after the final deadline for this article. Ah. When I call asking for a simple preview DVD instead, they mutter about an \"embargo\" - like we're dealing with sensitive nuclear documents instead of a sodding gameshow - and when I point out the embargo's sole function seems to be to prevent me from actually covering the programme they've invited me to watch, they give me the mobile number for someone who doesn't answer and doesn't respond to messages. So I call their office back and say, look, if you haven't got any DVDs, just let me know, I'll survive, I'll just write about something else, but hey, the deadline's looming. And they say they'll definitely get back to me. But they forget. Or don't bother. Thus annoying me. Now, I don't know much about PR, but presumably this is the opposite of what they were hoping to achieve when they first got in touch. It'd send Sir Alan into an apoplectic fury. \"You were meant to be promotin' the bloody show!\", he'd shriek, like a huge indignant hedgehog at the point of climax. \"You can't even get one poxy disc to the prick from the Guardian!\" All of which leaves me wondering whether it's actually part of a mind-mangling post-modern double-bluff. Perhaps the final task in the final show consists of two teams trying to promote The Apprentice itself, and the mobile I was ringing actually belonged to some strutting besuited bell-end in the mould of Syed. Who knows? I certainly won't, since I doubt they'll ever send me any preview copies of anything again. Oh well. Instead, let's discuss Get Your Act Together With Harvey Goldsmith (Tue, 9pm, C4), which arrived on a plain white DVD with no accompanying press bumph whatsoever: just the way I like it. On the surface, this appears to be a entertainment-based remake of Troubleshooter, in which each week gruff, no-nonsense Goldsmith takes on a floundering showbiz act and tries to turn them into a massive success. Sounds fun, right? Unfortunately, something's missing: namely any drama or sense of narrative drive. Show one centres on Samantha Mumba, the former R&amp;B sensation chiefly notable for having no discernable edge to her personality and looking a bit weird, like an incredibly stern baby with hair extensions. Enter Goldsmith, played by a stubbly Moomin. We're promised he'll ferociously bite heads off left right and centre. He doesn't. At least not here. He complains to camera about Mumba's diva tendencies, but whenever she's actually in the room he simply moans a bit. There aren't any fireworks, and most of the crucial conversations take place off-screen. By the time the show ends, it's hard to recall what he's actually done, apart from offering the odd bit of constructive advice and pulling a few strings. Realistic perhaps, and it makes him seem far more reasonable than, say, Gordon Ramsay, but for an hour-long show it's not enough to stop your mind wandering off to moonland. Here's hoping for more meat on future editions. Assuming Harvey hasn't eaten it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
