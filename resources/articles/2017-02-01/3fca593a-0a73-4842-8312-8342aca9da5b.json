About that 2-state solution Trump asked April Ryan, an African American journalist, if she would set up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss his inner-city agenda: \u201cAre they friends of yours?\u201d \u201cLeast racist person\u201d At the start of the press conference Trump announced a new labor secretary nomination: Alexander Acosta, a Hispanic law school dean who has staunchly defended the rights of Muslim Americans.
