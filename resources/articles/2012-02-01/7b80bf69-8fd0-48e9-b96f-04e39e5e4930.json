Wolves were booed off at the final whistle and the players were subjected to sarcastic cheers in the closing stages of the Liverpool game. They have picked up only 11 points from their last 20 league games \u2013 they won seven of their 18 points from the opening three fixtures \u2013 and are second from bottom in the table, yet the board remain behind McCarthy and there is no suggestion from within the club that his job is under threat before Saturday's visit to Queens Park Rangers. There is also plenty of support for him from within the dressing room. Roger Johnson, who has endured a difficult first season at Molineux since arriving from Birmingham City in the summer, insisted that McCarthy is \"the man to get us out of it\" and said \"you can't really get a better man for the job\". The Wolves captain, however, described the QPR game as \"must-win\", and the same description could easily be applied to the Black Country derby against West Bromwich Albion the following Sunday. Back-to-back defeats in those fixtures would crank up the pressure on McCarthy, although Johnson insisted that the manager must be given the chance to turn things round and claimed that the players are culpable for the poor run of results. \"Changing the manager isn't going to change what the players do on the pitch,\" Johnson said. \"Unfortunately, that's what it's like in football. The manager's head's on the chopping block. It's unfortunate. For me and all the lads, the manager needs to stay. We respect the manager massively. He's the man to get us out of it, he's done it before and he'll do it again. [He's a fighter], you can't really get a better man for the job. We've let ourselves down \u2014 the players on the pitch are the ones who let the staff and the fans down.\" With patience stretched to breaking point among the supporters, there is an air of negativity enveloping Molineux. Johnson said that the discontent in the stands is a hindrance to the players but he refused to criticise the fans for their reaction against Liverpool. \"It doesn't help, but they've paid their money and can voice their opinions,\" he said. \"They've got their say and they had their say [on Tuesday night]. It's not the first time, but we were losing 3-0 at home, what do you expect them to do?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
