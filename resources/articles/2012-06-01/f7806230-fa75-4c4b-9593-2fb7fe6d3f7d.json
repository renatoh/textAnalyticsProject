How are you feeling today? I'm feeling great, Small Talk. Was there anything else? Small Talk is really looking forward to the JP Morgan Premiership Rugby 7s, which we believe kicks off on 13 July before building towards a final in Bath on 3 August. How are you feeling about it? I'm really looking forward to it. The tournament's in its third year now and it's grown every year. I really enjoy it: the timing's perfect, coming in pre-season, to get some conditioning work done. It's competitive, and it's a great start to the season. Wow, sounds like you're even more excited than us. So you'll be taking it seriously then. That all depends on where the squad is, where you are as a player, what the coach feels is needed, who he thinks needs more game time. A lot of clubs use it to develop the youngsters they've got coming through, or to integrate the new signings who the coach might not have seen play very much. There are so many factors. Are Wasps in it to win it, or is it the taking part that counts? Me personally, I'm aiming to get out there, play a little bit, get a bit of conditioning in, and see how my foot is faring. But you never enter a tournament without intending to win it, and we'll be trying to get as far as we can. You mention your foot, which kept you out for most of the last four months of the season. How are you feeling? Well I played two games at the end of last season, and I'm hoping that I can start pre-season 100% fit and raring to go. I want a good long season, after two years dealing with pretty crappy injuries. It's been a tough couple of years. I want to be the best I can, and be as fit as I possibly can. One of those two games was at Bath, where you produced a magnificent try-saving tackle to make Sam Vesty look very silly indeed. Congratulations! That was my first game back. As a result of that we got a bonus point, and we stayed up by a point in the end. It was nice to be recognised for something that I've been criticised for in the past. That'll be defensive work in general, right? But since I've been at Wasps my defence stats have been really good, they've been happy with how that's developed. It was nice to get attention for something other than try-scoring, something I'm not famous for. Do you practise that kind of tackle? Of course we do. Every week we do defensive sessions both individually and as a team. It was never that I couldn't tackle, but that I would get myself into poor positions. It's all about stopping the ball at source, stopping the opposition player from offloading the ball. It's something I have improved on and want to keep improving on. Do you feel you're still as fast as when you first broke through? I'm definitely stronger, and definitely bigger. I don't believe I've lost any pace. I just need a season when I'm injury free really. You used to keep on top of all your stats. Are you still a big-time number-cruncher? I guess so, but only because of the injuries. When you're twiddling your thumbs a little bit, you do your rehab but there's not a lot else to do. So you watch a lot of videos, and do a lot of stats. You obviously look at your stats, and at the players you're competing with for an England place. You learn a lot about the game just from watching. In the last 18 months I've learned more about the game than I would have done if I was just playing. When you're playing the last thing you want to do when you get home is watch more rugby, so being injured has its benefits. Now I can't wait to play next year and show my coach and my team-mates what I'm capable of. You came from nowhere to break into the England team in 2005, when you had just turned 20. Did it all come too soon for you? I wish I could have played at sevens level for a bit longer. I played two tournaments and that was it, I was ripped off, thrown onto an England tour to Australia and you know what happened there [Australia's Lote Tuqiri dominated him to such an extent that he was left \"broken\"; he ended up restoring his confidence on loan at Division One Bedford]. From leaving school to the England tour was 18 months. At the time, I'd never have said no \u2013 it was a great opportunity for me. But looking back I wish I'd been given more time to find myself in the game, to learn about the game and myself as a player. I wish I'd been guided a bit more. Have you had any contact with Stuart Lancaster? Could a return to the England side be in the offing? He phoned me before they went on tour, to see how I was after my injury and to reassure me that my international career isn't over, and he wants to see me fit. It's in my own hands. If I play to my potential, it can happen again. I've been capped for a reason. I've played good rugby in the past. It's about recapturing that. I read that your dad is a blacksmith. That's a hard-as-nails profession right there. My stepdad, yeah. He also works as an electrician. Have you ever had a go at the, er, blacksmithery? Only a little bit as a kid. Talking of kids, you've got one of your own \u2013 Taio. Where did the name come from? It was my girlfriend's idea. She wanted a name that was a bit different. She's a bit spiritual, and it means \"godly\", or something like that. She liked it, and a happy wife means a happy life, know what I mean? Small Talk has absolutely no idea. You've got a dog as well. Does he have a similarly unusual name? He's called Frank. He's a black labrador. We got him from some Irish gypsies. He was a bit wild when we got him, but after a lot of hard work he calmed down a bit. You were once asked what your three wishes would be; you wanted to win the lottery and own a Porsche, but couldn't think of a third. Can you finish your answer now? Sure. I'd still like to win the lottery, but now I wouldn't want a Porsche \u2013 I'd like an Aston Martin. The last one would be for Wasps to have a better season than the last one. What's your favourite pasta shape? I like the one that looks like a bow tie. That'll be the farfalle. An unusual choice. Yeah, that's the one. The bow tie. What's the last album you bought, or downloaded, or whatever it is that young people do with albums these days Drake's new one. The best song is called The Motto. So what kind of music do you like? I've got quite a broad taste. I probably go more towards R'n'B and hip hop. I've got some absolute cheese on my iPod though. In the Wasps gym we have some proper boy band cheesy music that comes on \u2013 I quite like a bit of Boyzone or Backstreet Boys. Can you tell us a joke? A joke? I've got no jokes. I love comedy though, I go to a lot of stand-up. I saw Henning Wehn recently, he was so funny. It was quite raw. He's German, he does lots of jokes about the second world war. Some of them didn't go down that well with the crowd, but I loved them. What have you got on series link? Spartacus, 24 Hours in A&amp;E, Keeping up with the Kardashians \u2013 my missus makes me watch that one. I watch a lot of MTV music. What's in your pockets? My phone. And my keys. Essentials. What's your favourite zoo animal? The lion, because he's the king of the jungle. I like the way all the male lions lie around doing nothing, while the females run around getting the food ready and looking after the kids. I'd be a good lion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
