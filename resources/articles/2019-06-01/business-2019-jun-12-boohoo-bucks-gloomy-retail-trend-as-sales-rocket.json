The firm, whose brands include PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal and MissPap, has tapped into the popularity of cheap fashion bought by young shoppers on their mobile phones. Booho\u2019s sales rocketed 39% to \u00a3254.3m in the three months to 31 May. Sales rose 27% in the UK and 56% internationally. Growth has also been fuelled by Boohoo\u2019s \u201cfashion for all\u201d approach, offering its clothes, including tight-fitting bodycon dresses, swimwear and miniskirts, up to a size 26 and featuring plus-sized models. The retailer expanded into menswear two years ago. Boohoo was started by the fashion entrepreneur Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane in Manchester in 2006. It has expanded quickly, floating on the stock market in 2014 and now has 13m active customer accounts around the world. It sells own-brand clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products, largely to shoppers aged 16 to 30, who swap fashion tips through social media and follow styles embraced by \u201cinfluencers\u201d. The wider retail market continues to struggle, with consumer confidence hit by Brexit uncertainty, and a shift to online shopping. An industry survey last week showed British shoppers cut back on their spending in May by the most in more than two decades. Ted Baker issued its second profit warning in four months on Tuesday, blaming the weather and the torrid high street conditions which have sparked a price war. Household names such as House of Fraser, Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams have been forced to close shops and Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, is teetering on the brink of collapse. Arcadia creditors meet on Wednesday to vote on a complex rescue deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
