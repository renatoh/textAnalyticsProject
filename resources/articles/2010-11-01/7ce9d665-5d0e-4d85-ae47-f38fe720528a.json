Carew limped away from Villa's training ground yesterday before undergoing a scan today that confirmed he has suffered a slight tear in the calf and will be out for up to four weeks. It leaves G\u00e9rard Houllier with no option but to give the 19-year-old Nathan Delfouneso his full Premier League debut. With Fulham the first of three games in eight days for Villa, the timing of Carew's injury, which came 24 hours after Heskey damaged knee ligaments in training, could hardly have been worse. Agbonlahor, who has been out since the end of September after having groin surgery, has returned to full training but Houllier said he does not expect the striker to be fit enough to start against Blackpool on Wednesday. The Villa manager admitted he has never before been placed in a position where he is without all of his frontline strikers, but rejected any suggestion that a tougher training regime has contributed to the recent injuries. With Villa having failed to score a Premier League goal in 344 minutes of football, Houllier could have been forgiven for feeling particularly downbeat at the news regarding Carew. But the Frenchman insisted Villa could \"cope\" and also said he was relishing the chance to give an opportunity to Delfouneso, who he watched play for England in the European Under-19 Championship in France in the summer. \"I won't put pressure on [Nathan], I don't want him to feel that this is a make or break game for him,\" Houllier said. \"He's played for England Under-19 and the Under-21s, he scored for them a couple of times. He's been in the squad since I came here. We need to focus on what he can do well, and I expect him to do that and nothing more.\" Marc Albrighton has signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract, committing the 20-year-old winger to Villa until the summer of 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
