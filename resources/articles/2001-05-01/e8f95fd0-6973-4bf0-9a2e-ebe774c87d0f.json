With promotion won, the Blackpool manager could afford to smile as he was reminded of the November afternoon when he was more likely to be found with a pistol than a pint. Six months ago McMahon saw his team beaten 7-0 at Barnet, later relegated to the Conference. \"It's a frightening thought, isn't it?\" the 39-year-old said, contemplating the surely unique achievement of going up after losing so heavily to the country's worst side in the same season. Given that Blackpool were 15th and Barnet eighth after that game, even Mystic Meg might have struggled to predict the change in fortunes. \"If I'd thought there was no hope I would have walked away,\" McMahon admitted. \"But I still believed in them.\" Similar powers of recovery were needed on Saturday. Blackpool were twice behind, initially after 27 seconds, but deserved the victory that earned them an instant return to the Second Division. \"That game sums our season up,\" said McMahon, who inherited a relegation-bound squad in January 2000. \"What a roller-coaster ride it was.\" The big dipper on Blackpool pleasure beach looks tame by comparison. As well as that defeat by Barnet, Blackpool lost at home to Yeovil in the FA Cup and were struggling in 23rd place early in the season. This, though, was their sixth straight victory. McMahon said he took more pleasure from these events than from his success as a Liverpool player, and admits he has improved as a manager since his time at Swindon. \"The first year at Swindon I was like a bull in a china shop because I was player-manager,\" he said. \"My expectations were high. I probably thought the players could do what I could do, and they couldn't. I learned quickly.\" Blackpool's success owed much to the skill of Paul Simpson, the one-time Manchester City midfielder who set up the first, scored the third and had a role in the clinching late goal by Brett Ormerod. Ormerod's career features rejection by Blackburn, work making bed covers during two seasons with Accrington Stanley, a fractured shoulder blade and a broken leg. Now things are looking up. For Leyton Orient, a second play-off final defeat in three seasons was painful. Chris Tate put them ahead inside a minute when Blackpool's goalkeeper Phil Barnes slipped trying to clear a back-pass, and Scott Houghton's low shot restored their lead after Ian Hughes had headed in. But Brian Reid equalised and a Houghton error set up No3 for an increasingly dominant and neat-passing Blackpool after Orient's impressive 18-year-old striker Jabo Ibehre had struck a post. \"We need three or four players at least,\" McMahon said. With millions earmarked for redeveloping Bloomfield Road, will he get them? \"If they cost nothing and they're on \u00a32.50 a week I will,\" he said. Nothing seems impossible at Blackpool.
