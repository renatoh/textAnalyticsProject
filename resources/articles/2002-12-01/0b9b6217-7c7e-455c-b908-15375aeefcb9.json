In a Commons statement, Mr Clarke said this would be followed by annual increases of more than 4% and then 5%. \"This means an average real terms increase in revenue funding per pupil of over \u00a31,000 from \u00a32,840 to \u00a33,850 in the 10 years from 1996/97 to 2005/6,\" said Mr Clarke as he outlined details of how the government would be spending the extra cash for education that was originally announced by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in the comprehensive spending review. He stressed that it must be coupled to reform. Shadow education secretary Damian Green complained that most of the statement amounted to \"reannouncements\" of previous spending decisions and accused Labour of repeating its usual \"con trick\" over spending. \"It's clear you want to appear in a seasonally appropriate role as an early Father Christmas for schools,\" he told Mr Clarke. \"Sadly the wrapping is more enticing than the contents of the package.\" Mr Clarke told MPs the number of childcare places would be increased by 250,000 next year. Local education authorities had been given increases for investment in schools for the next three years and those authorities should in turn give schools budgets for three years, said the education secretary. He added that from 2005/06 the threshold payments which reward good, experienced teachers would also be devolved to schools' budgets. Progress was being made in securing union support for a more flexible education workforce, but money to fund the changes could not be released until the agreement was completed, he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
