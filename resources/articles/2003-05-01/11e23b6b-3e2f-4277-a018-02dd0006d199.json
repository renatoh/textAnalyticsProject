Supplement with vitamin C Vitamin C has a natural antihistamine action in the body, and some find supplementing with it helps alleviate problems. For a decent chance of success, 1 g of vitamin C should be taken two or three times a day. 2. Take quercetin Quercetin is a plant compound found in a variety of foods including citrus fruits, apples and onions. The recommended dose is 400 mg of quercetin, two or three times a day. 3. Drink yarrow tea Steep two teaspoons of the herb in a mugful of boiling water for 10 minutes and drink. 4. Eat horseradish A dab or two of this each day might just do something to keep the breathing easy during the hay fever season. 5. Avoid mucus forming foods Some foods tend to swell mucus formation in and around the nose and throat, worsening hay fever symptoms. While several foods are renowned for their mucus-forming potential, my experience is that the worst culprits are dairy products such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and ice cream. Keeping a lid on these foods seems to help reduce symptoms. 6.Drink coffee Caffeine has been found to bring relief from hay fever, possibly through its ability to constrict blood vessels and reduce congestion. 7. Try nettle Take 400-800 mg of nettle leaf every four hours. 8. Take a combined approach For those keen to take a combined approach, without the hassle of taking fistfuls of pills, I recommend the product Respir-All. This contains a blend of anti-allergic agents including nettle, vitamin C and quercetin, and can really help to provide natural relief from hay fever (mail order: 020 8795 3730). 9. Try Nasaleze A natural hay fever remedy based on plant cellulose, when inhaled Nasaleze is believed to create a thin film of mucus that provides an effective barrier against pollen. (mail order: 01535 691756). 10. Inhale tea tree oil Put a few drops of neat tea tree oil in a bowl of hot water, stick a towel over your head and breathe deeply for a few minutes. Diabetes and fish Diabetes, a condition characterised by elevated levels of sugar in the bloodstream, can give rise to a number of complications. One condition to which diabetics are significantly more prone is heart disease. As eating oily fish is known to reduce the risk of heart disease in the general population, researchers asked whether this might also work for diabetics. In a study published in Circulation , fish consumption and heart disease risk were assessed in more than 5,000 diabetic women over a 16-year period. Women eating fish at least five times a week appeared to slash their risk of heart disease by 64 per cent. While this study did not look at men, its authors believe that the benefits are likely to be similar. Folic acid in pregnancy There is some evidence that folic acid might help to protect against cleft lip and cleft palate in newborn babies. A recent study in the American Journal of Epidemiology has found that some women have difficulty processing folate (the form of folic acid found in food), and tended to be at increased risk of having children with a cleft lip and/or palate. This risk only appeared in women who did not eat enough folate or folic acid. Eating asparagus, avocado, broccoli, spinach, beans, pulses and lentils when pregnant (Brooke Shields, right) makes good sense as does taking folic acid. Overactive bladder and magnesium One in six adults suffer with something known as an overactive bladder. This condition tends to manifest as a sudden and compelling desire to spend a penny. Urination is often frequent during the day, and can cause sufferers to get up at night too. A significant percentage of individuals with an overactive bladder also suffer from something known as urge incontinence; essentially uncontrollable urges to pass water followed by small leakages from the bladder. Overactive bladder is thought to be related to spasm in and around the bladder. Drugs designed to reduce spasm in muscles are often recommended, though an article just published in the British Medical Journal concluded that these are ineffective. However, all is not lost. A recent study in the journal Family Practice News found that a natural remedy - magnesium - can provide significant relief for sufferers. Compared to individuals taking placebo medication, those treated with magnesium for just one month urinated less frequently during the day and at night, and were less prone to urge incontinence too. Magnesium can be found in nuts, wholegrains, fish and green leafy vegetables and supplementing with 300-500 mg of this mineral each day can help."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
