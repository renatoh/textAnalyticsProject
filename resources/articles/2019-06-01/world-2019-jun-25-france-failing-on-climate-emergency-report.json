The stark warning from France\u2019s independent advisory council on climate comes at a key moment, as the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy attempts to present itself as a world leader on the climate emergency. The centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, who sought to counter Donald Trump by promising to \u201cmake our planet great again\u201d, has tried to encourage other European nations to aim for neutral carbon dioxide emissions across the EU by 2050. Opinion polls have showed the climate emergency is a growing priority for French voters, who increased the Green party\u2019s score in European elections last month. But the report handed to the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, on Tuesday night suggests that everyday life in France does not match the political promises. France needs to seriously strengthen its climate policies \u2013 particularly on transport, car use and building renovation \u2013 if it is to meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the experts said. Crucially the report comes just as its authors described \u201ca new era in the long-running rivalry between France and Britain: who will decarbonise the fastest\u201d. The UK government announced this month that it had committed to a net zero emissions target for 2050, making Britain the first major economy to do so \u2013 with one of the most ambitious goals set by a leading polluting nation. In parallel, the French government is working on a draft energy and climate bill with the same target for 2050. France and the UK are the largest countries so far to set such an ambitious objective in legislation. France gets about 75% of its electricity from nuclear energy, which past governments argued meant lower carbon dioxide emissions than neighbours using coal. The government has pledged to reduce the nuclear energy share to 50% in 2035. But the report points to the ways in which the French government must work far harder to prepare the country for change. Carbon dioxide emission reduction has not been happening fast enough in France, the report found. France\u2019s first official objective, the 2015-18 carbon budget, was not met. During this period, annual emissions decreased by only 1.1%, much less than planned. The rate of decrease needs to triple by 2025 to catch up on the objectives, the authors said. The key culprit in this \u201cgap between ambition and reality\u201d was transport: emissions have not seen a real decrease in the last 10 years, including from cars and lorries. \u201cThere is not enough modernisation of transport, or if there is, it\u2019s going towards private cars and not public transport,\u201d said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, chair of the advisory body that drew up the report. Another problem is emissions from buildings, which have decreased three times more slowly than anticipated. Building renovation had not been effective enough. \u201cFrance\u2019s commitments are ambitious, but at the current rate, they are unlikely to be met,\u201d Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said. \u201cAs long as actions to cut carbon emissions remain at the margins of public policies, France does not stand a chance of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\u201d She said it wasn\u2019t enough to leave the climate crisis to an environment ministry. \u201cIt must be a national priority, central policy in all of government,\u201d she said. Macron faced a crisis in climate policy late last year when the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters took to the streets against a new carbon tax intended to urge motorists to change their behaviour. People in the countryside said it was deeply unfair to hike taxes on fuel use where there was no alternative transport to private cars. The tax was later abandoned. Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said lessons must be learned from the crisis and policies aimed at shrinking emissions should be fair and seen as fair, without increasing inequalities in different geographic areas. The report said that carbon budgets should be more ambitious and set in law. The carbon neutrality objective should include international transport, from aviation to shipping, and a strategy to reduce the country\u2019s global carbon footprint, which includes emissions from goods manufactured in other countries for consumption in France. Last year, Macron\u2019s high-profile environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, quit saying the government was taking only \u201cmini steps\u201d that were insufficient to deal with climate change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
