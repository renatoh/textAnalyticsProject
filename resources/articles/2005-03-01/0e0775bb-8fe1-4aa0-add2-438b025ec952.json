This morning's story on our front page, about a revolution in school dinners, looked like the real thing: proof that the passion of one man, in this case, Jamie Oliver, really could muster public opinion in a way that government could not ignore. Blimey we even had that Tony Blair on our comment pages, saying enough is enough and its time the people in power jolly well did something. He promised action. He promised a Trust. Most of all he promised MONEY. And so he should. Because good food does not come cheap. Raising the current 37p a head per meal to just 50p a head will cost 65p per child per week. That's more than \u00a327 a year. And there are millions of them. You do the maths. We're talking hundreds of millions of pounds a year here. And that's before you provide the money for more staff and better training. Too right there will have to be significant cash. Then tonight up pops education minister Ruth Kelly on the ITN news. (If only I knew how to blog it.) She talks about the school dinners trust. She talks about changing the culture. Twice she is asked if there will be extra money. Twice she replies that the spending of money on school meals will be a decision for the Local Education Authorities and for the schools themselves. In other words: you've got your cake. How you slice it is up to you. So absolutely no new money for these terrific school dinners. It looks like we've been had. So what of that significant investment Blair talked about? The reconstruction of school kitchens? The better equipment? Looks like that's all coming from the \u00a39.4 billion primary school building programme announced in last week's budget. A classic case of announcing the same spending twice which, as we know is a standard New Labour ruse. And don't even get me started on Blair's suggestion that school meals should be going organic. Even Oliver, with all his celeb-powered arm twisting, couldn't make that happen. And anyway it's a red herring. At the moment what matters is not how the chicken fed to your children is raised but whether it ends up breaded and in the deep fat fryer. It all sounds to me like more of the pre-election election campaign bidding war for voters that Andrew Rawnsley so perfectly pointed up in his column this morning. God I'm cross. Let's see if the children's manifesto being announced tomorrow makes amends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
