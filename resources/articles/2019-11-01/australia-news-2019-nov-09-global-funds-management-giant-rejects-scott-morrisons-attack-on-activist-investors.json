The UK\u2019s biggest listed fund manager, which controls assets worth more than \u00a3550bn, also defended the role of environmental groups including Market Forces, which has been accused by the attorney general, Christian Porter, of pressuring companies through \u201cwidespread, co-ordinated harassment and threats of boycotts\u201d. Aberdeen\u2019s intervention in Australian politics comes after bank bosses on Friday told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environmental groups and rejected the need for changes to the law foreshadowed by the Morrison government. In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council last Friday, Morrison attacked \u201can escalating trend towards a new form of secondary boycotts in this country\u201d in which environmental groups \u201care targeting businesses and firms who provide goods or services to firms they don\u2019t like, especially in the resources sector\u201d. \u201cSome of Australia\u2019s largest businesses are now refusing to provide banking, insurance and consulting services to an increasing number of firms who just support through contracted services to the mining sector and the coal sector in particular, which is the nation\u2019s second-largest export sector,\u201d Morrison said \u201cI think some of our largest corporations should listen and engage with their quiet shareholders, not just the noisy ones.\u201d An Aberdeen spokeswoman said the company had a \u201ccritical role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the adaptation to climate change impacts through our products and investment decision\u201d. \u201cWe see environmental, and particularly climate, risks as financially material to the businesses that we invest our clients\u2019 money in and that is why it is a strong focus of our analysis,\u201d she said. The company is among shareholders in BHP who delivered large votes in favour of a resolution proposed by activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that, if passed, would have forced the mining giant to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and other lobby groups with a track record inconsistent with the company\u2019s position on the climate crisis. \u201cLike many large asset owners and asset managers, we actively engage with companies and much of this engagement is done \u2018quietly\u2019, in that it is conducted privately between ASI and the company,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe believe this is generally the most effective way to influence change. However, we strongly believe that there is also a place for \u2018noisy\u2019 action where other forms of engagement have been ineffective, and where the issue of concern is not aligned with the company\u2019s broader strategy. \u201cShareholders, noisy or quiet, are not faceless institutions. As shareholders, it is our responsibility to represent the interests of our clients in generating sustainable long-term returns.\u201d She said Morrison\u2019s remarks would have no effect on the group\u2019s strategy. \u201cOur engagement and investment activities are informed by our disciplined investment approach, and we will continue to engage with companies, quietly or otherwise, where we believe that company strategy does not adequately address material environmental, social and governance issues \u2013 including climate change,\u201d she said. Asked about the government\u2019s attack on Market Forces, which is associated with environment group Friends of the Earth, she said that protesting was \u201can effective and vital part of a democracy\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day, companies are commercial organisations that will not be influenced by activist groups unless they can see a commercial benefit,\u201d she said. Under questioning from Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, Andrew Leigh, and the Greens deputy leader, Adam Bandt, at a parliamentary hearing on Friday, the Westpac chief executive, Brian Hartzer, and his counterpart at the Commonwealth bank, Matt Comyn, both denied they felt bullied by climate activists. Leigh took Hartzer to Westpac\u2019s climate commitments, asking: \u201cIs it fair to say you made these decisions in your own business interests rather than being bullied into it?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Hartzer replied. He said Westpac made its decisions after taking into consideration its role in society. \u201cWe do that independently,\u201d he said. Asked if the law needed to be changed as foreshadowed by Morrison, he said: \u2018No, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s specifically proposed there.\u201d Bandt put it to Comyn that it didn\u2019t sound like the CBA was being \u201cbullied\u201d. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Comyn said. He said that to his knowledge the bank had never asked the government to change the law because of campaigns people ran that affected its business. The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s deputy chief executive, David Cohen, said that the bank\u2019s \u201cexperience has been that engaging with some of the environmental groups has been to our benefit\u201d. He said it had helped shape the bank\u2019s thinking on environmental, social and governance issues. \u201cI think that\u2019s enriched our own thinking over time,\u201d he said. Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski asked Comyn if the bank had been subjected to shareholder activism by groups that bought small parcels of shares in order to put motions or be disruptive. \u201cOne of the unique and positive features of the AGM is that people, regardless of their shareholding, are able to get up and ask questions of the chairman,\u201d Comyn said. He said the number of questions on the environment had increased recently, mirroring wider debate in the community. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable and as I said in many ways positive that small shareholders are able to stand and ask questions of the board and management of their company,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
