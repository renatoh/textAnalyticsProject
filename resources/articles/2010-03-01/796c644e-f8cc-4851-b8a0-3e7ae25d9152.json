Before he pens the first draft of the squad for Australia in the summer, Johnson ought to look at Olly Barkley and ask whether the Bath centre could once again be part of the answer to England's midfield problems. Last summer, when Barkley had left Gloucester but was still to rejoin Bath, the 28-year-old turned down the chance of adding to his 23 caps. Barkley told Johnson and the England attack coach Brian Smith that rather than play in the two Tests against Argentina he might be better getting his head straight after a wasted season. Unfortunately it was not the head that turned out to be the problem. Instead Barkley broke a leg in Portugal during pre-season training, an injury that took seven months rather than the expected six weeks to heal, and it was not until Saturday that Barkley and Bath's World Cup-winning fly half Butch James made their first start of the season together. They conjured up the most convincing of wins over Harlequins, which keeps a resurgent Bath team on track for the play-offs. Barkley scored a neat, side-stepping try, helped to make another and collected a total of 14 points, leading his coach, Steve Meehan, to suggest that the inside-centre be part of the 40-strong touring party. \"He's not in his prime yet, but before the end of the season we'll start to see that,\" said Meehan. \"He has a real chance, a very strong chance of making that trip.\" Meehan was also delighted with the Barkley-James partnership and in particular the way it set up Joe Maddock's try wide on the right after a lineout on the left: \"That's just a brilliant bit of rugby. If anybody scores a better try than that this weekend, it will have to be an absolute screamer. It's almost two seasons since they played together. They looked pretty good as a combination.\" Meehan might also have mentioned the understanding that has developed between Barkley and Shontayne Hape, the powerful outside-centre Johnson would have played in the Six Nations against Italy but for illness. \"He has a very accurate long pass, Olly, and good speed so he can get outside defenders and release outside attackers quite nicely.\" Quite apart from likes of Barkley and Hape on the Bath side and Toby Flood and Ben Youngs with Leicester, Johnson may also like to see how the current form side in the Premiership gets on against the defending champions. Since they were two points off the bottom at the start of December, Bath have won seven out of seven in the league. Saturday's three-tries-to-one victory was as complete as it was attractive, the only down point being that Bath somehow failed to pick up a try bonus point. \"If we had nailed that performance in October we would have been doing laps of honour,\" said Meehan. \"To hear the players say we should have been harder on ourselves and should have scored that fourth try is a very good position to be in.\" Bath Abendanon (Little 77); Maddock, Hape, Barkley, Banahan (Cuthbert 70); James, Claassens (capt); Flatman (Barnes 18), Mears (Dixon 72), Bell (Jarvis 72), Hooper, Short (Grewcock 63), Beattie (Faamatuainu 68), Salvi, Watson.
