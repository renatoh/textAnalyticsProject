Three gas cylinders connected to a detonator left on a low wall outside the school exploded at 7.50am, killing the 16-year-old and injuring up to 10 others, one seriously, as they arrived for lessons. The blast, which experts said was designed to kill, shattered windows in surrounding buildings and was heard across the southern Italian city. Mainly attended by girls, the school is named after Francesca Morvillo Falcone, wife of anti-mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone. Both were killed by a mafia bomb in Sicily on 23 May 1992, almost exactly 20 years ago, leading many to suspect a mafia role in the bombing, for which no one has yet claimed responsibility. An anti-mafia march was due to be held in Brindisi. \"You can understand the symbolism of this,\" said Cosimo Consales, the mayor of the Puglian port town. \"This was an attack by organised criminals.\" However, interior minister Anna Maria Cancellieri said the attack did not bear the hallmarks of a mafia attack, while Achille Serra, a former Italian police chief, said Italian mafia clans typically killed magistrates and police officers. Targeting schoolgirls, he said, was \"unprecedented\". But an assessor with the region of Puglia, Nicola Fratoianni, pointed the finger at Puglia's mafia, the Sacra Corona Unita, which has grown in the shadow of more notorious Italian mafias such as Sicily's Cosa Nostra, the Naples Camorra and the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta. Originally specialising in smuggling cigarettes from the Balkans, the Puglian mafia developed protection rackets in Puglia and built an arsenal of weapons thanks to ties with Balkan gangs during the 1990s, but was believed to have been weakened by a series of police operations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
