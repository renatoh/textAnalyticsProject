And it\u2019s entirely of Turnbull\u2019s making", "bodyText": "There\u2019s an old adage in politics: never waste a crisis. When severe storms caused a power blackout across South Australia last week, the Turnbull government bent mother nature to its will. But there\u2019s another adage that Malcolm Turnbull and his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, should remember: don\u2019t win the battle only to lose the war. Last week Frydenberg showed what a shrewd politician he is. He won lots of battles. First, after the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, blamed renewable energy for causing the blackout, Frydenberg appeared sensible as he assured Australians that he knew it really was the 80,000 lightning strikes and 140km/h winds that caused the power to go out. Frydenberg then massaged Joyce\u2019s unfounded renewable energy alarmism into an acceptable message about the challenges renewable energy might pose. \u201cThere are real challenges and the priority for us as a Coalition government is energy security. You see, it\u2019s OK to have more renewables, to reduce emissions, to meet our international targets but if people\u2019s homes go dark, if businesses get shut down, if there\u2019s huge economic loss and there\u2019s a threat to safety.\u201d And who poses this \u201cthreat to safety\u201d and the economy, according to Frydenberg? State governments that have set higher renewable energy targets than the federal government. Specifically, Labor state governments. And, for good measure, Frydenberg also fingered the federal Labor opposition\u2019s 50% renewable energy target by 2030 for blame. Then Frydenberg distracted everyone\u2019s attention by creating a \u201cproblem\u201d to be solved. All the energy minister had to do shift the nation\u2019s focus is suggest that renewable energy targets across the nation should be \u201charmonised\u201d. Frydenberg didn\u2019t have to explain why a different target in different jurisdictions is a problem. He didn\u2019t have to explain why he\u2019s never raised that issue in a serious manner before. (Case in point \u2013 the Coag energy council last met on 19 August 2016. That meeting\u2019s communique made no mention of the need for a nationally harmonised renewable energy target.) The minister deployed a trick as old as the Australian federation. Never forget, consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. When a federal government has nothing else to say, it reaches for national harmonisation: it sounds so insightful and sensible and self-evident. It\u2019s not. There are lots of good reasons to avoid harmonisation for its own sake. It stifles innovation. It disregards local solutions for local conditions. It reduces capacity to respond to changing circumstances. It creates red tape. It often adds cost. Nonetheless federal governments usually win with propaganda on harmonisation (until it falls apart: think the VET Fee-Help scheme). On renewable target harmonisation, Frydenberg is winning so far. But \u2013 pardon the awful pun \u2013 storm clouds are gathering on the government\u2019s horizon. Frydenberg has made himself and the Turnbull government responsible for delivering solutions they will struggle to achieve. Start with Frydenberg\u2019s decision to convene a meeting of the Coag energy council this Friday to force the states and territories to discuss harmonising renewable energy targets and achieving energy security. Does anyone seriously think that state Labor governments are going to adopt the Turnbull government\u2019s lower renewable energy target of 23% by 2020? No chance. Even if Frydenberg redefines his harmonisation goal to getting the state and territories to slow down or stretch out their targets, he\u2019s still got a problem. The premiers and chief ministers won\u2019t agree to a compromise without the prime minister giving something away too, like increasing the federal government\u2019s target. Little chance Joyce and the anti-renewables brigade in the Coalition will applaud that. Second, \u201cenergy security\u201d appears to be Frydenberg\u2019s shorthand way of saying that Australia needs to ensure that its infrastructure \u2013 poles and wires and baseload supply in our national energy market \u2013 is sufficient to withstand major weather events. Sounds benign, doesn\u2019t it? For example, a second interconnector in South Australia might have kept the lights on in part of the state during last week\u2019s once-in-50-year storm. But at what cost? And who is going to pay for it? Remember that much of that infrastructure in SA and around the country now sits in private ownership \u2013 thank you, Liberal state governments. Either the Turnbull government stumps up the cash for these private sector companies (yeah, right) or it faces the wrath of voters when their electricity bills jump ever higher to pay for the upgrades the federal government requires. So much for Tony Abbott\u2019s efforts to save households all that money on their electricity bills by removing the carbon tax. Third, it beggars belief that Frydenberg and Turnbull think the government\u2019s continued drop in the polls can be arrested by allowing Malcolm to look tough on renewable energy targets. Only six years ago, Turnbull was predicting Australia could be 100% reliable on renewable energy within a decade. A little over six days ago, he \u201csaved\u201d the Australian Renewable Energy Agency from his own government\u2019s cuts. But now Turnbull says renewable energy is a threat to our economy and safety? Turnbull\u2019s continued drop in the polls suggests voters are frustrated that the \u201creal Malcolm\u201d \u2013 who supported same-sex marriage, a republic and an emissions trading scheme \u2013 is not the prime minister. It\u2019s hard to see how giving voters another example of Turnbull\u2019s inauthenticity is going to help his \u2013 or his government\u2019s \u2013 standing. Nonetheless, the renewable energy battle is under way, and Josh Frydenberg is leading the charge. Add it to the list of battles the Turnbull government is fighting: business tax cuts, school funding, the ABCC legislation, the same-sex marriage plebiscite, media law reform, a childcare package, university deregulation, NDIS funding, Stuart Robert, the looming Myefo and the NBN, to name a few. In hindsight, maybe Turnbull and Frydenberg should have just let mother nature take the blame for what happened in South Australia, and moved on. This might have been one crisis worth wasting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
