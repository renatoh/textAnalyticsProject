Dale took the club over for \u00a31 from Stewart Day, who had taken out loans secured on its Gigg Lane ground and run the club at a loss, and whose property development companies were about to collapse into administration. Under rules introduced after the serial financial collapse of clubs, including Bury, in the early 2000s, the EFL must be satisfied that a prospective new owner is \u201cfit and proper\u201d under its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, and has enough money, from a legitimate source, to fund the club. In normal takeovers a prospective buyer is notified to the EFL in advance for these checks, including on the \u201csource and sufficiency of funds\u201d, and the league will block a takeover if it is not satisfied that the money is there. The EFL regulations state that \u201cup to date future financial information\u201d must be submitted by a club \u201cas far in advance of the change of control as reasonably possible\u201d or, if that is not reasonably practicable, within 10 working days after the takeover. Dale, however, did not undergo any part of that process before his takeover and even now, seven months into his ownership of Bury, he has still not provided the EFL with information it requires to be satisfied that he has the money to fund the club. In a statement an EFL spokesman said it began to conduct the checks required by the regulations only after Dale took the club over from Day: \u201cFollowing notification of the transfer of shares at the club, the EFL immediately began to implement its change of control processes, which include submission to the owners and directors test \u2026 as well as seeking additional information in regard to the source and sufficiency of funding.\u201d The spokesman also confirmed that Dale and Bury had still not provided the EFL with the necessary financial information: \u201cWe remain in active dialogue with the club concerning the outstanding information as required under EFL regulations, and will continue to offer assistance as the club attempts to find a long-term solution to the complex and challenging issues it currently faces.\u201d Bury are understood to have been placed under an embargo on registering new players, until the EFL has been convinced the money is there to pay them. The manager, Ryan Lowe, left, along with several players who won promotion for the club from League Two last season despite not having been paid, at that time, for 12 weeks. It is not clear what squad the new appointment, Paul Wilkinson, will have to start the season. On Thursday several employees at the club were sent letters terminating their employment, with an official explanation that \u201cthe company has become insolvent and is unable to pay their debts\u201d. Samantha Gibbs, who was recruited as recently as last September to be Bury\u2019s venue operations director, said that staff had not been paid for May or June and will be \u201cfinancially ruined\u201d. She said: \u201cNobody is saying that Steve Dale put the club into debt but the club has been in chaos since his takeover.\u201d Last month Dale made an offer to settle 25p in the pound of the club\u2019s non-football and unsecured debts \u2013 HMRC was owed \u00a31m at that point \u2013 but the creditors\u2019 voluntary arrangement (CVA) proposal was adjourned this week. The administrators of Mederco, one of Day\u2019s collapsed property companies, has claimed since the proposal was made that it is owed approximately \u00a37m in loans made to Bury while Day owned the club. James Frith, the MP for Bury North, told the Guardian: \u201cI am dismayed to learn that Bury\u2019s current owner may not have passed through the ownership regulations which the EFL are supposed to administer prior to any completed takeover. All Bury FC fans will want to know, as I do, what on earth these rules are for.\u201d Dale had not responded to a series of questions from the Guardian at the time of writing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
