Can you recommend walking tours that would not break the bank? Helen Wilson Guildford I haven't managed to track down too many affordable walking holidays, so any suggestions from readers are welcome. There are plenty of ways to see some of Norway's wilder bits, but not all of them involve leaving behind crowds. From Oslo or Bergen you can take the popular Norway in a Nutshell tour (www.norwayinanutshell.com) which includes two scenic railway journeys, a boat trip along Europe's narrowest fjord and some lovely roadside views. This beautiful journey can take between one and three days, but is crowded during the summer. Heading to Bergen youth hostel and asking around should be all it takes to hook up with some travellers intent on hiking or exploring the fjords of the south-west. For real hiking head for the Jotunheimen Mountains and the Hardangervidda plateau in central Norway. Again, you should be able to join other walkers in towns with hostels such as Boverdalen or Geilo. See www. vandrerhjem.no for details of hostels. Book ahead in summer. Lastly, a ride on the Hurtigruten (www.hurtigruten.no) coastal steamer will show you lots of Norway's beautiful coastline.For more information contact Visit Norway (020 7389 8800; www.visitnorway.com). I am interested in a low-budget backpacking holiday in Malawi next summer. What is the cheapest way to get there - is it by a direct flight to Lilongwe or Blantyre? Or is it better to fly to a neighbouring country and go overland? Nick Baron, via email It's a long overland trek, so your best bet is to fly direct. You can get flights to Lilongwe for as little as \u00a3450, though this will often involve a lengthy stopover in Nairobi or another connecting city. For a quicker flight via South Africa or a shorter stop in Kenya you're probably looking at \u00a3550 or more. British Airways (0870 850 9850; www.ba.com) has good connection times via Kenya. Try Virgin Atlantic (0870 380 2007; www.virgin-atlantic.com) for flights via Johannesburg. The dry season in Malawi runs from April to October and is the best time to visit. Later in the dry season is best for wildlife. The landscape is greenest from May to July. I was due to fly from Sydney to Wellington to renew my visa but was refused boarding at check-in. Apparently you can enter New Zealand only when you have an onward or return ticket to a country with no visa requirements. Could you clarify the procedure? Nick Strickland, by email This is Tourism New Zealand's response: 'The rules for visitors to New Zealand (and Australia and most of the South Pacific) are quite straightforward: visitors require an outward ticket to a country to which they have right of entry. In this case, when Mr Strickland left Australia he did not have a valid visa to return and therefore no right of entry back to Australia. It is not for the airline to judge whether he is going to get a further visa, so [his airline] Virgin Blue was right to deny travel as his return ticket did not satisfy immigration requirements.' Obviously some airlines interpret the rules in different ways. More information at: www.immigration.govt.nz. I have just booked a skiing holiday to Italy with three other people. My travelling companions are all teachers, so we have had to book the holiday between 26 March and 2 April. Many tour operators have been able to provide accommodation but not flights (and therefore also transfers). I have booked flights independently to Verona, but I was hoping you might offer advice on the best (and ideally cheapest) way to transfer from the airport in Verona to the resort of Selva Val Gardena. Rachel Chorlton, by email The easiest way is to hire a car, but this isn't the cheapest route and not everyone fancies driving on mountain roads. From Verona or Brescia airport, where Ryanair flights arrive, there are shuttle buses running into Verona city, terminating at the train station. They take 20 minutes and cost \u00a32.50 from Verona; from Brescia it is \u00a37.50 and takes 45 minutes. On arrival in Verona, take the train to Bolzano. Trains are roughly hourly, take around two and a half hours and cost around \u00a325 for second class. From Bolzano there are hourly buses to Selva Val Gardena. More details are available at www.val-gardena.com. Over to you... readers feedback On aiming to ski in Bosnia (Ask the Experts, 19 December): You might want to tell Peter Stockton there are cheaper ways to get there. I usually fly with EasyJet to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and then take an 11-hour night bus to Sarajevo. This costs a fraction of the price of flying from London via either Budapest or Belgrade. It is more fun and you get to see fantastic scenery, as well as experiencing Balkan driving at its worst! Additionally, it is only the groomed ski runs that have been de-mined following the war of the Nineties, so off-piste skiing is still off the agenda for some time. Joe Wheeler, by email Sarah Cooney wanted to cut the cost of travelling to Alaska (12 December): There is the option of flying to Frankfurt (which if I read the price correctly is \u00a323 on British Airways, which is booking now for May) and then taking a Thomas Cook flight from Frankfurt to Fairbanks, which will be cheaper than the \u00a3750 you quote and the flight time will be a lot shorter with this 'over the Pole' flight. Nicholas Jacobs, Anchorage, Alaska Regarding Mike Charlton's letter about what to do on a day in Tahiti (Letters, 12 December): My advice is to hire a car and take a ferry to Moorea. This beautiful, tranquil island is far less busy and humid than Tahiti. Jim Connor, by email We welcome letters. Tom Hall from Lonely Planet addresses as many as possible here.
