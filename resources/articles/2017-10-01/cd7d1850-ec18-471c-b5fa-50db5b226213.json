Wilkinson announced the shock news on Twitter on Monday night, saying she had done her last show. It was a brutal end for a network star Nine has groomed for a decade. Sources said Wilkinson was offered $1.8m for the breakfast show gig next year but was asking for $2m \u2013 closer to what is paid to her co-host, Karl Stefanovic, who is said to be on a $6m three-year-deal. But Nine\u2019s chief executive, Hugh Marks, was not going to go any higher and Wilkinson\u2019s agent, Nick Fordham, walked away empty-handed from protracted negotiations on Monday. \u201cNine today confirmed we have been unable to meet the expectations of Lisa Wilkinson and her manager on a contract renewal for a further period,\u201d Nine said in a statement. \u201cWe express our gratitude to Lisa for her 10 years with the Today Show and are disappointed we find ourselves in this position. Nine will be going in another direction and will be considering our options in the coming weeks and months. \u201cToday Show is one of the biggest roles there is in television and requires an enormous commitment from its hosts. The partnership between Lisa and Karl has taken the show to the success it is today and we thank Lisa for everything she has done for the show and for Nine over the past 10 years. We all wish her well for the future.\u201d . On Tuesday morning\u2019s show her former colleagues expressed their shock and paid tribute to a \u201cstrong, influential, fun and compassionate woman\u201d. Stefanovic said she\u2019d handled a decade\u2019s worth of \u201cbrutal\u201d 3.30am starts with grace, intelligence and \u201ca wicked sense of humour\u201d. \u201cIt is safe to say we are all a little shocked and it will take time to sink in,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for now, this: Thank you.\u201d Nine sources said Stefanovic was paid more than Wilkinson because co-hosting Today is not his only job. He has his own successful primetime show This Time Next Year, plus regular 60 Minutes assignments as well as live anchoring rolling news coverage of floods and other major news events. In her statement Wilkinson thanked Nine for the privilege of co-hosting Today. \u201cI would particularly like to acknowledge my colleagues Karl, Sylvia, Georgie, Tim, Richard, Stevie and Natalia, as well as all the hard working producers and the entire team behind the cameras \u2013 every one of them has contributed to the incredible success of the show. \u201cMost particularly though I want to thank the Today Show audience who have been so supportive and incredibly loyal to me over the last decade. I can never thank you enough and I look forward to seeing you soon.\u201d Within hours Wilkinson announced she had secured a deal with the troubled Ten network to present the new Sunday Project and to be a presenter on The Project, despite the network being in receivership. Ten is set to be taken over by the American CBS network but its shares were last week declared to be worthless by KPMG. Ten, which has a lower pay scale for on-air talent, is unlikely to be able to pay Wilkinson what she was used to at Nine, sources said. Ten said in a statement that Wilkinson would join The Project and The Sunday Project in a hosting role, but none of the three hosts, Carrie Bickmore, Waleed Aly and Peter Helliar, are leaving. \u201cLisa Wilkinson is one of the most respected journalists and television presenters in Australia and we are thrilled that she has agreed to join Ten\u2019s fantastic stable of on-air talent,\u201d said Ten\u2019s chief content officer, Beverley McGarvey. \u201cIn a career that has spanned magazines, radio, television and digital media, Lisa has established her credentials as a leading figure in the Australian media industry. She has a great connection to the Australian public and a reputation that is second to none. We are proud that she has agreed to join the acclaimed team at The Project and The Sunday Project.\u201d Wilkinson, a former magazine editor, joined Today in 2007 and has steered the breakfast show to number one in the major cities \u2013 although the rival Sunrise on Seven wins the ratings nationally. The 57-year-old also has a role as editor-at-large for Huffington Post Australia and is hosting the Walkley awards at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
