At best it's a blotchy close-up", "bodyText": "It's too early to say Tory policies are unravelling. But there are loose threads showing, and a bare patch or two. For months, Labour people have been complaining the opposition isn't put under the scrutiny it deserves as favourite to win, and that, close up, Team Cameron looks much less impressive. First, the kerfuffle over marriage, over which Cameron admitted he had \"messed up\". You might have thought there was nothing easier for Tory strategists than devising a robust pro-marriage policy. For Conservatives to favour marriage is bland, comforting, apple-pie-and-custard politics, about as safe as it gets. Nor has there been a shortage of time to tinker with the cost of it. Yet the minute the cost of married couples' allowances was fingered as a problem, Tory high command seemed to panic. It seems that some basic thinking just hadn't been done. The result is a non-policy policy, the assertion that the importance of marriage will be strongly recognised in the tax system but, erm, we're not sure how or when. A bit of extra cash is not the reason most people decide on marriage, so the sums involved have to be substantial. Except that, for the time being, they won't be. It gets worse. As David Davis demonstrated at the weekend, many thinking Tories are concerned about introducing a new tax policy that damages single parents who are single through no fault of their own \u2013 the Afghan soldier's widow, the divorcees who have escaped abusive marriages, and so on. How does the Tory emphasis on rewarding marriage square with their professed new liberalism about gay couples and sympathy for social victims? What seemed a simple and safe policy isn't. There are plenty of other examples. Take \"Green Cameron\", the enthusiastic environmentalist of not so long ago. Recently, the website Conservativehome polled 250 Tory candidates in the most winnable seats about their political priorities; 141 replied. Cutting the budget deficit, reducing red tape, and slashing the cost of welfare were the three most popular priorities; the environment was at the bottom. \"Reducing Britain's carbon footprint\" was the top priority of just eight candidates, as against, say, 45 choosing the repatriation of powers from Europe, and 43 cutting immigration. A skim through the Conservative press and blogosphere reminds you just how unpopular anything to do with global warming is. The Tory party's intellectuals are clambering on the \"global warming isn't caused by mankind\" bandwagon with as much enthusiasm as they used to oppose the Maastricht treaty or speak up for apartheid South Africa. Displaying contemptuous scepticism for climate change science has become the right's new badge of honour. It seems as if Tory candidates are rejecting green issues, just as the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and others have sharpened up Labour's environmental credentials. So where do the Tories stand on something millions of voters consider the biggest policy challenge of all? We really don't know. Did I mention Maastricht? Europe hasn't gone away as a policy headache for Tory high command, even though Cameron successfully slipped off the hook of his earlier promise of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. He has promised vaguely that powers will be repatriated without explaining which, when and, above all, how. It is, like the support for marriage, a fuzzy warm fug instead of a policy. The Conservatives may be revolutionary on Europe, or they might (my hunch) be all words and no action. But it's quite a big issue. Tory candidates are simply biding their time. Another recent issue is defence cuts. There are a substantial group of Tory MPs and candidates who are outraged at the idea of cutting back on the armed forces while the war in Afghanistan rages on, and who would vote against a George Osborne budget that involved serious reductions in defence spending. Conservative rhetoric has been highly critical of Labour for failing to provide enough equipment, including helicopters, and for failing to \"back our boys\". Despite a recent speech from Cameron implying he'd like to concentrate more on home defence, he is just as committed to the same conflicts as Gordon Brown. So how are the numbers supposed to work? It's the kind of conundrum the Tories' defence minister in waiting, the former army chief Sir Richard Dannatt, might have been expected to resolve \u2013 except that he had to retreat from his new Tory role after an outraged reaction from other senior military chiefs and former mandarins. On the same theme, will Britain's aid budget be taken over by the Foreign Office under the Tories and be used for quasi-military work? And if so, what does the Tory aid team think of that? Again, good questions, minus good answers. I began by saying it was too early to announce the unravelling of Conservative policy-thinking \u2013 but in many cases it's partly because the policies haven't been ravelled in the first place. Given the money and advice apparently available to Cameron, the PM to be, that is astonishing. The reasons are familiar to those who watched New Labour in the old days. First, Cameron is trying to appeal to the maximum number of people while not alienating his party loyalists; and this is providing policies that make a decent headline but blur, and become bland, by the second paragraph. Second, he is operating with a small team of people and not really opening up his policymaking to a wide range of colleagues. That's bound to create resentment \u2013 as was shown in complaints over the weekend about communications chief Andy Coulson apparently making up prison policy on the hoof. Just as the Chilcot inquiry is throwing harsh new light on Tony Blair's version of sofa government, the Tory version is becoming apparent \u2013 a rather nice, natural wood Notting Hill kitchen table, perhaps. People are seemingly so fed up with Brown and Labour that little of the above is resonating. The media and perhaps the public seem to have decided it's time for a change, and that while it may be interesting there are holes in Tory policy, that won't change their vote. If so, we are all creating the conditions for disappointments, outrages and failures in the next parliament \u2013 the same tension between an inner clique and the rest of a party, the same unresolved choices carried into government, the same \"they're all useless\" reaction from voters. In the interests of politics, and even of David Cameron, not merely of Labour or the Lib Dems, it's time to turn up the lamplight on the Tories. In a few months' time it will be too late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
