What's the best water container that's easy to get out of your pack and doesn't weigh a ton? Here's something new from the US, an easy-to-use hands-free drinking system. How does it work? The lightweight two-litre bladder straps on to your shoulders like a backpack. The tube has a valve at the end which you just have to bite to get as much water as you want. It's streamlined, has a breathable mesh harness and elastic straps to lash on a jacket or extra layer of clothing. I've already got a rucksack. Can it fit inside it and still work? Yes, the Sto-Away model has no straps and just slips into a rucksack. What about if I want to go cycling? Will it jiggle about? There are 11 different cycle Camelbaks that won't get in the way and are easy to use. What if I'm in the mountains? Will the water freeze? There are three winter models with insulated tubes and bite-valve covers so the water flows freely in all conditions. The Camelback Classic costs \u00a329.95. For stockists, phone 01423 325325. The new 2001 range will be in the shops from February. For details, see www.camelbak.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
