Members of the Federation of Tour Operators, which represents 70% of package holidays sold in the UK, have said customers can cancel holidays without charge, although they must notify their tour operator by January 15. Customers flown home early will be offered pro rata refunds for days lost since the disaster. A spokesman for the FTO said: \"After January 31, normal booking policy applies and customers wishing to rearrange or postpone trips should speak to their individual tour operator.\" The FTO has already flown home over 3,000 people but some holidaymakers are still stranded. Others have decided to continue their holidays. Kuoni said it has spoken to the majority of its 1,530 guests in the region but has been unable to contact all of them. It has had confirmation of one death in the Khao Lak region. Smaller tour operators, such as Audley Travel and Bales Worldwide, which specialise in tailor-made trips, are rearranging itineraries or allowing customers to postpone travel. \"If clients phone now who are travelling in April, we are saying we will get back to them when the situation is clearer. In Thailand we are keen to get people back on the western beaches as soon as we can as so many people there rely on tourism for their livelihoods,\" said Craig Burkinshaw, managing director of Audley Travel, which had 19 clients in Thailand and 12 in Sri Lanka, all of whom are safe. Meanwhile, holidays to the Maldives, where around a third of island resorts were damaged, are going ahead. Thomas Cook has departures tomorrow and Monday and again on January 9 and 10. At time of going to press, the situation in affected countries was as follows: Sri Lanka The south-east coast of the island has been worst hit, with devastation of resorts around Galle, Matara and Trincomallee. The west coast beaches and interior \"cultural triangle\" are relatively unaffected. Many tour operators have cancelled trips until January 31; others - Bales Worldwide, for example - are rearranging itineraries for clients in the country or due to travel imminently. Thailand Worst hit tourist areas are along the west coast - particularly Phuket, Koh Yao, Krabi, Koh Lanta and Khao Lak - and off-shore islands including Phi Phi and others on the Andaman Coast. Members of the Federation of Tour Operators have cancelled holidays to affected resorts until January 7. After that holidays will resume to certain parts of the affected areas. Maldives Of the 87 resorts, 32 have sustained serious damage. Of these, 19 are expected to be shut for weeks or months, with the other 13 fully operational within \"days or weeks\". The High Commission of the Maldives says it wants to receive tourists and a number of tour operators are offering programmes to inspected properties. Seychelles Three hotels - Paradise Sun, La Reserve and Vacanze Cote d'Or Lodge - have closed temporarily. Vice president Joseph Belmont said: \"All inter-island and international flights are running on schedule and tourists are going about their holiday in a very normal way.\" Malaysia Popular tourist areas of Langkawi and Penang have some hotels badly affected, but damage is patchy so tour operators are able to offer accommodation in alternative hotels nearby. Some problems with electricity and water supply, and some beaches off limits. Other countries India: South-east coast and Andoman and Nicobar islands badly hit, with \"real risk of disease\". Indonesia: \"Tourists should avoid travel\" to west and north coasts of Aceh on Sumatra, says the Foreign Office. Kenya and Tanzania: Malindi Coast and some Zanzibar resorts damaged. \u00b7 Three fundraising initiatives have been launched by UK travel companies. The Travel Industry Earthquake Appeal has been started with a \u00a310,000 donation from travel agency Travel Counsellors. At the time of going to press, 15 organisations had signed up to Travel Aid 50 which has pledged to donate 50 pence for every customer who books a holiday in January 2005. And the Association of Independent Tour Operators has set up an immediate fund of \u00a330,000 for water purification in Sri Lanka. Donations for victims of the tsunami can be made via the Disasters Emergency Committee by phoning 0870 6060900 or via website dec.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
