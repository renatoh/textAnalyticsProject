Here was a clean, ubiquitous source of energy that might, whether by fission or fusion, underpin human occupation of the planet. Guided round purring power plants by smiling, white-coated men, I saw chemistry and physics walking hand in hand towards a peaceful, prosperous horizon. Since then we have all learned much. We have learned that accidents happen, scientists differ, statistics lie, ministers equivocate, the Earth warms and energy abuse may determine not just its climate but even its habitability. We have also learned a more sinister truth, that on this subject minds never seem to change. The question may be one of science but the answer is reserved for juju. Prejudice trumps reason. As the responses to yesterday's ministerial statement on nuclear energy poured in, all that was clear was that money corrupts debate and that government money corrupts it absolutely. I do not believe a word that the \"renewables\" industry and its front organisations say, because they want to get at \u00a31bn of public funds over the next five years. I would tell the odd lie for that. Nor can I believe what the nuclear lobby says, because it too conceals profit behind planet-saving, and has already cost the taxpayer billions to clean up the last generation of reactors. Nor am I inclined to believe the government, given the inexcusable cowardice of its 2002-03 energy review, which ran screaming from any decision. There should be a rule that all those pronouncing on energy policy should reveal who last bought them lunch. That goes for scientists, journalists, academics, lobbyists and ministers. In this business, follow the money. Otherwise, trust nobody. I was sceptical of global warming, in part because I was once persuaded by a reputable scientific conference that the world faced a crisis of global cooling, indeed a new ice age. I was later persuaded otherwise. My next scepticism was over whether the warming was man-made or natural. Here too I now consider myself converted. What has been caused by mankind can, in theory, be un-caused, though I cannot see humans reverting to the energy stone age, even to avert a species auto-da-fe. Real debate is therefore between spending huge sums of money on reducing carbon emissions or on protecting low-lying land from inundation. The ambivalence of this debate is no argument for doing nothing. We can both cut emissions and build dykes. Dykes are easy. As for emissions, the layman can only fall back on people he trusts and arguments he finds plausible. On the whole I trust the government chief scientist, Sir David King, the chief astronomer, Sir Martin Rees, and the doyens of the Royal Society, certainly more than I do the Ecologist magazine and David Cameron's glittering court. I have long admired James Lovelock's Gaia thesis and its view of the world as a self-equilibrating organism, even if I cannot grasp his latest apocalypse of \"an imminent shift in our climate towards one that could easily be described as hell, so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive\", wandering, camel in hand, from one oasis to another. This sounds like the climatic equivalent of Blair and Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. Do men of a certain age always end by crying, \"After me the deluge\"? Where I agree with Lovelock is that you cannot both be apocalyptic and rule out the world's leading carbon-light energy source, nuclear, because you do not like the idea of it, because it is expensive and because Tony Blair is for it. One day a new form of energy may emerge. We may tame the ocean, wire the Sahara and tap the Earth's core, but that is not here and now. Britain faces the loss of the nuclear 20% of its power generation, and wind and waves cannot sensibly replace it. If nuclear can meet 90% of France's fixed energy needs and 30% of Finland's then it must surely be right to renew it. The arguments against the government's proposed return to nuclear power seem rooted in prejudice. They are that it is costly, dilatory and accident-prone, leaves nasty residues, can be used to make nuclear bombs and anyway would not be needed if we invested heavily in conservation. There is force in some of this, but none of it seems to outweigh the fate of the planet. If that really is the issue then arguing over costs, risks and subsidies is fiddling while Rome burns. We can and should make all energy far more expensive to encourage conservation and reduce subsidy. We can limit planning delays to questions of location, as the government proposes. We can minimise the risk of accidents, as in the new generation of fail-safe reactors. We can bury waste underground, as in Finland's new Olkiluoto 3 plant. But either global warming is serious or it is not, and we are supposedly persuaded that it is. We can all conserve energy, but there is not the remotest chance of doing so to the extent needed to bring down emissions. No government is inclined to stop cheap air tickets and reduce food miles. The doom-mongers cannot have it both ways. They cannot question the anti-nuclear case - as did my colleague George Monbiot here yesterday - with all the passion of a lapsed Catholic and yet stay chanting Hail Marys with the high priests of greenery. Some time ago Blair answered a Commons committee question about nuclear generators with a flippant, \"Would you want one in your constituency?\" Now, as he approaches his date with destiny, he, like Lovelock, is having an attack of urgency. There is much to be suspicious of in yesterday's announcement. Faster should not mean easier power-station planning, let alone the non-planning that John Prescott and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks have used to force through their beloved and near-useless wind turbines. Even as we scramble to avert Armageddon, the environment we purport to be saving should be treasured. There are appropriate and inappropriate sites for new energy sources, be they nuclear stations, barrages, dams or turbines. As with counterterrorism, those claiming to defend civilised values should not destroy them in the process. The world is unlikely to follow a lead from Britain, and the journey to a safer planet may be forlorn. But that is no excuse for not trying. Something tells me that Britain will one day live happily with nuclear power, and that Britons will wonder what all that fuss was about back in 2006. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
