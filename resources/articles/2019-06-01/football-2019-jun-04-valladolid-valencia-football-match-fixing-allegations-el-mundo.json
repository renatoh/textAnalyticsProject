Wire taps carried out by police over the past six months, following suspicions raised by a second division game between Huesca and Gimnastic de Tarragona at the end of the 2017-18 season, have now allegedly caught the former footballer Carlos Aranda, suspected of being the leader of the conspiracy, outlining the result required and claiming that seven players had been bought. According to extracts of the investigation which were published in the newspaper El Mundo, the former Real Madrid and Leeds United defender Ra\u00fal Bravo, accused of organising match fixing with Aranda, met the Valladolid captain Borja Fern\u00e1ndez in a bar during the buildup to the final game of the season. Fern\u00e1ndez then set up a meeting with a number of players. In one of the recordings, Aranda can allegedly be heard saying: \u201cLook brother, Valencia have to win the first half and in the second, OK?\u201d Valencia won 2-0, with a goal in each half. Valladolid had secured survival the week before, while Valencia needed to win to take the final Champions League place. Their 2-0 victory denied Getafe the chance to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in their history. There is no suggestion that Valencia were involved in the conspiracy in any way or were aware of it. Prosecutors believe that this was driven by gambling, not the interests of the clubs. The initial investigation began when the league alerted to suspicious betting patterns at the end of last season in the second division; now the investigation has expanded to include this highly significant first\u2011division match. In one of the recordings, according to El Mundo, Aranda is heard telling someone: \u201cNo one can find out about this and no one means no one, eh. Not your friends, no one.\u201d That same day, wire taps are said to reveal that he called the bookmakers he owns in M\u00e1laga and said: \u201cBet \u20ac10,000 and you\u2019ll take \u20ac20,000.\u201d He and Bravo were among those arrested last week, accused of leading the criminal gang. They were released on bail having been in jail in Zuera, Zaragoza province. Fern\u00e1ndez was also arrested. All three have denied any wrong-doing. Borja\u2019s representatives put out a statement saying that that the player does not even bet and his agent, Gustavo Mateos, told Radio Marca: \u201cHe has no doubt about his honour but he is worried. He has asked me to tell the people of Valladolid not to doubt him, that they [can] trust in their captain. Everything will be cleared up. He is sunk. He answered every question: he is the person most interested in finding out what has happened.\u201d When Aranda was released from prison he said: \u201cIn the end, they have put in [prison] those who have the least guilt. I would like to thank the people from the jail, the people from Zaragoza in prison and Huesca. We don\u2019t know why [we\u2019re here]. That\u2019s why we came, because we don\u2019t know [why] and nor do they.\u201d Ra\u00fal Bravo said: \u201cThanks to the local police, the national police, civil guard, judge and fiscal because the truth is that the treatment has been spectacular from the start, they have treated us very well and I can\u2019t say anything more. At trial, who is guilty and who is not will be seen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
