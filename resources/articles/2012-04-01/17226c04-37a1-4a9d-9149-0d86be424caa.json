Jerry Rothwell's film offers a dispassionate inspection of Bekoji, and introduces us to genial coach Sentayehu Eshetu, the man who spots potential champions and puts them on the conveyor belt. There doesn't seem to be any magic answer \u2013 other than a desire to escape grinding poverty \u2013 and any aspiring Olympian has plenty of obstacles to overcome: we see one promising 14-year-old virtually crack up over the uncertainties she faces. Still, this is a valuable insight into the roots of the sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
