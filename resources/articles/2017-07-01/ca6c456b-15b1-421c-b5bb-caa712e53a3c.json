Priebus leaves the White House less than a day after the failure of healthcare reform in the Senate. The former chair of the Republican National Committee, who had risen through the party machine, had been hired as chief of staff in part because of his relationship with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, in particular Paul Ryan, the House speaker. But the failure of efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something which never particularly enthused Trump, helped seal the fate of the long embattled Priebus, who had faced constant attack from his new colleague, communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Priebus\u2019s departure \u2013 announced by the president on Twitter \u2013 comes a week after embattled White House spokesman Sean Spicer finally stepped down. However, the move had long been in the works, with one source telling the Guardian that Trump had decided on replacing Priebus with John Kelly two weeks ago. Spicer, who had long worked for Priebus at the RNC, had stepped down after Trump brought Scaramucci on staff. Scaramucci promptly fired one RNC holdover on the communications staff, and immediately set about bad-mouthing Priebus on television and describing him as a \u201cparanoid schizophrenic\u201d to a reporter for the New Yorker. Scaramucci had claimed he and Priebus were like brothers \u2013 Cain and Abel \u2013 neglecting to note how that sibling rivalry ended with one murdering the other. His replacement by Kelly, a political outsider who had served as a general in the US marines before being named Homeland Security secretary by Trump marks the transition to a White House fully defined by the President\u2019s admiration for businessmen and generals. It also means that Trump\u2019s administration is now almost totally devoid of establishment Republicans. Instead, it includes a mix of ex-Democrats such as his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, as well as fervent nationalists such as Steve Bannon and speechwriter Stephen Miller. Priebus\u2019s dismissal is also unlikely to ease Trump\u2019s relationships on Capitol Hill, particularly in the House of Representatives, which has proven far more amenable to his agenda than the Senate. Ryan is a longtime Priebus ally dating back to their rise in Wisconsin Republican politics, and Ryan vocally backed Priebus on Thursday, telling reporters: \u201cReince is doing a fantastic job at the White House and I believe he has the president\u2019s confidence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
