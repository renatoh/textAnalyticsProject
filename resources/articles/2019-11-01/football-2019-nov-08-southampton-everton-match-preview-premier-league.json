Marco Silva, who has been less than strident in making his team\u2019s case against controversial VAR decisions in the last two games \u2013 two penalties denied against Spurs, a shocker awarded to Brighton \u2013 and arguably costing his team five points in what is becoming an increasingly difficult season, will have to reshape the midfield again, with Andr\u00e9 Gomes joining Jean-Philippe Gbamin on the long-term injury list. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has his own problems, winless in the league at home and desperate to rebuild confidence after their 9-0 shellacking by Leicester, though he has Moussa Djenepo available to start for the first time in weeks.
