After a lengthy meeting this afternoon, the FA has agreed that the fixture will be played at Aston Villa's ground on Saturday April 3, with a 12pm or 12.15pm kick-off. Arsenal manage Arsene Wenger had called for the match to be switched to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff because of its greater capacity and easier access from London. But, having correctly assumed the game would be pulled forward a day from its scheduled Sunday berth and given a lunchtime kick-off, United dug their heels in and demanded the match be played at the original venue where the Red Devils won their famous 1999 semi-final replay against the Gunners. They argued that their fans would be greatly inconvenienced at having to head to South Wales at such a time and pointed out their opposition to playing a semi-final at the same venue as the final. Supporters from both clubs then waded into the debate, suggesting they were being treated as \"turnstile fodder\" by the game's governing body. Finally, after a meeting involving all relevant parties, the FA has switched the fixture back to original venue. \"Given all the realistic options, this is welcome news,\" said Mark Longden, spokesman for the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association. \"Supporters of both Arsenal and Manchester United were rightly concerned that decisions were being taken without the input of the people who would be most inconvenienced by the eventual outcome. \"It is the fans who have to pay for their tickets, and they deserve to be consulted on matters of this kind.\" With both Arsenal and United hoping to be involved in Champions League action the week after the semi-final, a switch to Saturday was always likely - and the news means Villa's scheduled Premiership encounter with Manchester City will now be postponed. Earlier, Wenger confirmed his wish to play at the Millennium Stadium but insisted he would accept whatever the FA decided. \"We've made it known that we would prefer Cardiff, because there will be a massive demand for tickets,\" he said. \"But we will accept whatever the FA decide. If we have to play at Villa Park then we would still be happy.\" The timing of the game squeezes the space between the league game between the pair on March 28, which could be bad news for Sven-Goran Eriksson - given that England head to Sweden for an important friendly in the middle of the following week. Wenger has already confirmed he will be without Gilberto for the FA Cup clash because he will be required for Brazil's World Cup qualifier against Paraguay, a situation which is almost certain to also apply to United midfielder Kleberson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
