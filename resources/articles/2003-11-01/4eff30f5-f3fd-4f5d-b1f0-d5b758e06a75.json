GUS shares closed 10.5p higher at 727p, excited by talk that the company could announce plans to demerge the Burberry holding alongside next Thursday's interim results. Under its chief executive John Peace, GUS has been rapidly unravelling its conglomerate structure to focus on Argos, and Experian, its credit checking business. Its home shopping business has gone - sold to the Barclay brothers for \u00a3590m this year - as have its vehicle financing and leasing businesses, and plans are afoot to spin off its South African operations next year. According to analysts, the next logical step for Mr Peace would be to dispose of the Burberry holding. The Swiss investment bank UBS reckons that one mechanism for doing this would be to demerge it to shareholders on a three-for-eight basis. Alternatively, UBS says GUS could opt for a secondary placing. However, it thinks this would be unnecessarily complex as investors would probably want GUS to pay a special dividend with the sale proceeds. In the wider market, the FTSE 100 shrugged aside the impact of six heavyweight stocks trading ex-dividend to close higher. That it did so was thanks to a firm opening on Wall Street and a good performance from index heavyweight Vodafone (of which more later). The final scores showed the FTSE 100 up 26.1 points at 4,371.2, with Cable &amp; Wireless the biggest riser. Its shares gained 12.5p to 140.75p after the telecoms company announced that it had made progress in cutting costs in the US. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 gained 31.2 points to 5,789.5, while the FTSE Small Cap index firmed 0.5 to 2,474.4. Market turnover topped 3bn shares thanks to heavy trading in the steel group Corus, which saw 20% of its share capital change hands after announcing a fully underwritten \u00a3300m placing and open offer. Corus closed 6p higher at 32p. Over in the bond market, gilts recouped early losses to close higher as US treasuries rallied. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 122.870, yielding 5.031%. Back among the blue chips, Vodafone rose 3.5p to 127.75p after Deutsche Bank advised clients to buy ahead of next Tuesday's half-year figures. The German broker expects the mobile phone company to announce a 30% hike in its interim dividend. Rexam was another strong performer, rising 15p to 431p amid speculation that the packaging group is to announce a 3% increase in beverage can prices. Analysts reckon that such a move is likely, given that Rexam's US rival Ball Corp announced last month that it would raise can prices in Europe by \u20ac5 (\u00a33.45) per thousand in the coming year. Among banks, Royal Bank of Scotland added 29p to \u00a315.85 after Citigroup Smith Barney advised clients to take advantage of recent weakness and buy. The US broker notes that, since mid-October, RBS has lost almost \u00a33bn of market value on concerns that it would issue shares to pay for a US acquisition. Having crunched the numbers, Citigroup reckons RBS could fund an acquisition of up to $7.6bn (\u00a34.5bn) without any need for a share issue As such, it believes that RBS could and should push ahead with the acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Sovereign Financial. On the downside, the support services company Rentokil Initial faded 3.75p to 225.25p after CSFB repeated its \"reduce\" recommendation. British Airways was among the top performers in the FTSE 250, cruising 16.75p higher to 239.25p - its best finish since May 2002 - on hopes that the company will be promoted to the FTSE 100 at next month's quarterly review. Based on last night's closing price, British Airways had a market capitalisation of \u00a32.6bn, which should be enough to ensure promotion. In the smaller companies world, market professionals piled into medical equipment maker Osmetech, up 0.1p to 3.3p, after hearing that current trading is ahead of expectations and a couple of big deals are in the pipeline. Gresham Computing shed 27p to 396.5p, unsettled by rumours that Cable &amp; Wireless used yesterday's interim results to talk down the prospects for Real Time Nostro, the real-time clearing and banking settlement system for which Gresham provides the software. Elsewhere, Cybit Holdings, the telematics solutions group, which has risen 200% in the space of a month, gained 7% to 3.47p, despite \"take profits\" advice from house broker Seymour Pierce. Restaurant operatorASK Central surged 23.5p to 166p after admitting it had received a bid approach. After the market closed, City Centre Restaurants, 1.75p stronger at 77.5p, was unmasked as the mystery predator. Homestyle hit its highest level since February amid continued speculation that its Rosebys textiles unit has been put up for sale. The shares closed 11.5p up at 158p. Finally, keep an eye on Newsplayer, 0.25p higher at 19p yesterday. Market gossips believe that the online newsreel company, which counts veteran broadcaster Sir David Frost as a director, will announce that the Strategic Investment Trust of Japan has purchased a 5% stake. SITJ is a \u00a3100m investment vehicle which takes holdings in companies in the broadband internet arena with a view to encouraging consolidation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
