The greats are included, of course, from Louis Armstrong to Miles Davis, from the Duke to Dizzy, Monk and Billie, and racism, sexism and the entrenched elitism of the musical world all get tackled on the way. And there's a place for Sgt Pepper, as well as an appearance from Justin Bieber... \"Jazz is a way of playing,\" said the great jazz pianist and educator Billy Taylor.
