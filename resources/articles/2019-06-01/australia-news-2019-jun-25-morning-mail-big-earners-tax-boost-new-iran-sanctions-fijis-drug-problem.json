Top stories The Morrison government\u2019s tax plan to tackle \u201cbracket creep\u201d will give more compensation to income earners who need it the least, a new analysis of Australia\u2019s tax system has found. The Australia Institute reviewed 18 years of tax policy and found wage earners at all levels had been overcompensated for bracket creep, with income tax cut by larger amounts than the tax increased owing to moving up a bracket. Including the government\u2019s planned flat tax of 30% for people earning between $45,000 and $200,000, the thinktank estimates someone earning $60,000 would be $1,919 a year better off compared with if tax thresholds had just been increased to account for inflation. But someone on $125,000 would be $7,035 a year better off and someone on $200,000 was $19,785 better off. Donald Trump has ordered new sanctions against Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, in the latest step of an escalating campaign against Tehran. Sanctions have also been issued against eight Revolutionary Guard commanders. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, will face fresh sanctions in a few days, US officials said. Signing an executive order, Trump called the increased sanctions \u201chard-hitting\u201d, saying they would deny the supreme leader, his office and and those closely affiliated with him access to key financial resources. Cocaine and methamphetamines are fuelling crime and chaos in Fiji, as the Pacific island nation grapples with a growing drug problem. Law enforcement says increased domestic drug use in Fiji, as well as in other Pacific nations such as Tonga and Samoa, has been fuelled by a combination of factors: growing economies, booming tourist industries and the fact these countries lie on a transnational drug-shipping route used by traffickers to bring cocaine and methamphetamines from the US and Latin America to Australia and New Zealand. Last May a fisherman in Papua New Guinea found $50m worth of cocaine buried in sand. Within two weeks, his chance find would lead to his remote community being threatened by a drug gang, a week-long open-ocean police boat chase, a booby-trapped fishing vessel running aground on a reef and the disappearance of the huge cocaine haul. World All eyes are on Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan after his party lost the mayoral election in Istanbul. The result has serious financial implications for the ruling Justice and Development party and its patronage networks, and will amplify the sense that the president\u2019s power may be starting to wane. British Conservatives have stepped up warnings that a Boris Johnson premiership could lead to the collapse of the government if the leadership frontrunner attempts to pursue a no-deal Brexit. E Jean Carroll has said she is considering bringing a complaint to the New York police department. The celebrated advice columnist has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s. An unprecedented week-long heatwave is beginning its advance across continental Europe. Meteorologists said temperatures would reach or even exceed 40C from Spain to Switzerland, as hot air was sucked up from the Sahara by the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe. Nasa\u2019s Curiosity rover has detected its largest belch of methane on Mars so far, exciting scientists and fuelling speculation that the robot may have trundled through a cloud of waste gas released by microbial Martians buried deep under the surface. Opinion and analysis \u201cI was Boris Johnson\u2019s boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister,\u201d writes Max Hastings, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph and London Evening Standard. \u201cIt would be fanciful to liken the ascent of Boris Johnson to the outbreak of global war, but similar forces are in play. There is room for debate about whether he is a scoundrel or mere rogue, but not much about his moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth. Nonetheless, even before the Conservative national membership cheers him in as our prime minister \u2013 denied the option of Nigel Farage, whom some polls suggest they would prefer \u2013 Tory MPs have thronged to do just that.\u201d Last week for the first time the Australian government two-year and three-year bonds fell below 1% and, on Friday, so too did the yield for five-year bonds, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cI know bond yields are not the sexiest of subjects \u2026 but they give us a good insight into where the economy is likely heading.\u201d And it isn\u2019t good, writes Jericho: \u201cThey also put paid to any hogwash that the government could rightly have claimed during the election campaign that the fundamentals of the economy were strong.\u201d Sport Ashleigh Barty has pulled out of Eastbourne with longstanding shoulder problem. The French Open champion, having the season of her life with three titles and 35 wins from 41 matches, said she was taking no chances with the flare-up and expected to be fully fit for Wimbledon next week. When England play Australia at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday, there are a few questions that will need answering,\u201d writes Geoff Lemon. \u201cFor England\u2019s part, whether they will flourish or falter when the pressure really starts to build. For Australia\u2019s, whether this current team can really mount a credible challenge for the trophy.\u201d Thinking time: the native Australian plants facing extinction Humans are devastating the world\u2019s plants and causing a \u201cfrightening\u201d number of extinctions, according to a global scientific survey of the issue. This is certainly the case in Australia, where plants make up 72% of the total threatened species list. This accelerating decline in the world\u2019s biodiversity will have grave consequences for human society, as the UN\u2019s global assessment report found. Research by the Threatened Species Recovery Hub listed the 100 plants that are most at risk, threatened by urbanisation, inappropriate fire regimes, introduced plant disease and habitat loss. \u201cThe good news is that every one of the species on the list can be saved \u2013 we have the techniques required, we just need the commitment,\u201d said a researcher, Dr Rod Fensham from the University of Queensland. Our interactive guide allows you to explore the types of plants at risk, the regions at risk and the major threats, with an example for each category. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald leads with the headline Minister signals shakeup for super, with Jane Hume saying she doesn\u2019t think the government \u201ccan morally ask workers to give up more of their current earnings and put them into an inefficient system\u201d. The Australian calls Scott Morrison\u2019s tax cut \u201can ultimatum for senators\u201d, as the PM \u201cmoves to ensure the Senate sits without a break until the Coalition\u2019s entire $158 billion income tax cut package is passed when parliament resumes next week\u201d. And killer whales in WA have Australian accents, the ABC reveals. Coming up More than 150 religious leaders from across Australia will issue an open letter calling on Scott Morrison to recognise Australia\u2019s \u201cmoral responsibility to avoid climate catastrophe\u201d. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will deliver his first major speech since taking on the role after the election at the National Press Club.
