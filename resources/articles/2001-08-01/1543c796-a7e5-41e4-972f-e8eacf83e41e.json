Henrik Larsson saw his second-half penalty saved by Livingston goalkeeper Javier Broto after Gary Bollan had been sent off for lashing out at Jackie McNamara. But manager Martin O'Neill had already watched Johan Mjallby limp off with an ankle injury, just four days before the Champions League clash with Ajax. Premier League newcomers Livingston, who took a point away at Rangers earlier this month, found themselves under pressure from the first whistle as Celtic, with Momo Sylla and Steve Guppy making their debuts, tried to create an opening. But Marvin Andrews was the main reason for them gaining a point after an outstanding performance against Larsson and John Hartson. Hartson had a half chance, Guppy saw his shot blocked and Andrews saved his side with a superb tackle on Hartson after Larsson had put him through on goal. But Celtic had a real let-off when David Fernandez raced away, but with only goalkeeper Robert Douglas to beat he pulled his shot wide. Both sides were hardly holding back as the tackles came flying in. Chris Sutton, who was again in defence, was lucky to escape a card after appearing to elbow Barry Wilson as the pair clashed in the Celtic half. After the break, the home side looked the more likely to break the deadlock. In the 70th minute, Stuart Lovell unleashed a shot from 25 yards, forcing Douglas to make a diving save. But things started to turn ugly and Livingston were reduced to 10 men when Bollan received his marching orders. Larsson took responsibility but he thundered his spot kick down the centre and Broto pulled off a fabulous save with his feet. As the final whistle blew the home fans, players and management celebrated while O'Neill was left with plenty to think about before Ajax come to town."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
