He is a strong lad and can actually get stuck into some real work in the garden. For his birthday he asked for a wheelbarrow. He struggles with an adult wheelbarrow but all the children's gardening tools are toddler-size; the spades and forks are silly things that rust if they get left out for a night or snap if you try and work with them. Is there anything out there that would suit him? Kate Towsey, Orkney There is one company I have found that does wonderful children's wheelbarrows: Haemmerlin (www.haemmer in.ltd.uk, 01384 243243). Haemmerlin makes them for grown-ups but they also make proper ones for little folk too. The Mini Star, \u00a330.99, is suitable from about four years of age and has the classic one wheel at the front. The Twiny, \u00a334.99, is suitable for even younger gardeners, from age two, and it has two front wheels for greater stability. Both are extremely smart and business-like and, I think, will be perfect for your son. It is much more expensive, but you may also want to consider the Puky Handcart, \u00a3129.99 (for stockists, see www.amba-marketing.com, 01392 840030). This is a steerable, four-wheel wooden cart with pneumatic wheels, the sides detach for easy loading and it's got a waterproof hood. It can be put to a myriad of uses in the garden for work and imaginative play. As you've already found, almost all children's gardening tools are toys and not tools. I guess manufacturers just don't think children will want to garden much so go for the cute factor over any real function, which is a shame as gardening is a great way to get children outdoors and away from TVs and computers. The Little Pals range is different. It is part of the Gardener's Pal range, which, as the name suggests, has all sorts of things for gardeners in it. Go to www.gardenerspal.com, 01455 209777, for stockists and enquiries. Little Pals launched 11 years ago specifically to fill this gap in the market; all the tools are proper, sturdy gardening implements and are perfectly scaled down to two thirds of the size of a normal-size tool - so not as small as some of the toddler-size ones you've seen. Although the colours are bright and what you would expect of children's things, the range is also bought by fully grown adults with small hands. Everything is tested to EN71 standards (European toy safety regulations) so, for example, the gardening gloves aren't in leather in case children chew them (the issue being that, depending on how it's been treated, leather can contain chemical residues.) Sadly, no wheelbarrows, but there is everything from spades (\u00a35.45), trowels (\u00a32.45), rakes (\u00a35.45), forks (\u00a32.45) and watering cans (\u00a36.99) to kneeling pads (\u00a31.75). The one thing you won't find is child-size secateurs. This is because of the safety angle - they're deemed just too dangerous, and if they were made in small sizes then it'd seem like they were encouraging children to use them. For those whose children aren't quite so keen on an authentic gardening experience, or perhaps a bit too young to really give the tools much of a workout, Asda currently has a little bucket, hand-rake and spade set reduced to \u00a33.50. Again, something that's more a toy but which my little girl loves, is the Flower Growing Starter Kit (\u00a310) from Early Learning Centres. In a little metal suitcase you get a bag of soil, two flower-pots, some seeds (for sunflowers and sweet peas, how nice), a very self-important apron and a pair of gloves. Thanks to all those who wrote to me about the pets column (July 29). Many of you suggested chickens as good pets. Jenny Willis said they are particularly good as they eat scraps from the kitchen and if the children do lose interest you still have working pets that give you lovely fresh eggs. Her children have a chicken each and love them. Ivy Dennett-Thorpe was given a budgie when she was seven and was so \"enchanted by it\" she's kept birds ever since. She now has nine canaries and says they can live longer than the six years I reported. She said parents wanting a fairly low-maintenance pet would do well to consider a budgie or canary (but as I advised, not together, please). And following on from the board games column on July 22, Eddy Richards wrote in to recommend www.boardgamegeek.com as a good place to get unusual board games. Also, for those of you who write in every week asking for information on past columns that you have missed/ mislaid etc, all the Personal Shopper columns are kept online at www.theguardian.com/family. Thank you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
