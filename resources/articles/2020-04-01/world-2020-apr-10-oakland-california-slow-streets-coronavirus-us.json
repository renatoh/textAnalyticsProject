Oakland\u2019s \u201cslow streets\u201d initiative, announced on Thursday by Mayor Libby Schaaf, will set aside up to 10% of the city\u2019s streets for recreation. Starting this weekend with four specific intersections, affected streets will be closed to thru-traffic. A list of street closures will be published by Oakland\u2019s department of transportation. \u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said on Thursday. Like many Californians, Bay Area residents have flooded parks and local beaches since a shelter-in-place order took effect in mid-March, prompting officials to close parks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. City officials hope the slow streets initiative \u2013 which they are calling an emergency measure \u2013 will give residents a safe way to get outdoors for Easter weekend while area parks are restricted, but Schaaf cautioned residents on Friday that the initiative does not mean public health guidance should be ignored. \u201cSocial distancing is the only vaccine we have to fight this deadly virus,\u201d Schaff said on Friday. The news was met with resounding applause from local transportation advocates. Schaaf asked motorists to adhere to the restrictions and be extra mindful of children on the streets, reminding residents streets will still be open to local traffic. But Schaaf stopped short of enlisting police to enforce the restrictions. \u201cWe will not be giving out, at this time, citations,\u201d said the mayor, adding that people have enough to worry about amid a pandemic. Roughly 11% of the city\u2019s land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks \u2013 streets and sidewalks make up an additional 20% to 30%, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the expected sunny, holiday weekend. The news was especially welcomein East Oakland, a neighborhood historically overlooked and impoverished, residents said at a press conference about the initiative on Friday. Many East Oakland residents continue to work, despite the shelter-in-place orders, said one community advocate, often walking to their jobs to do so. Any effort to make streets safer is good news for the community, he said. \u201cSome of us have to survive and we survive by working,\u201d he said at a Friday press conference. \u201cLiving in East Oakland, every day is an emergency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
