Bryson will head back into the lab, ready to cook up a winning strategy for a November Masters. Can anyone stop him? You\u2019ll have to join Scott Murray to find out. I\u2019ll leave you with Ewan Murray\u2019s report. Bryson DeChambeau is a major winner. He holds as many US Open titles as Tom Watson and Gary Player, which is one more than Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo. The professor isn\u2019t so nutty after all. He may, in fact, have changed the shape of golf inside four competitive rounds. DeChambeau\u2019s six-under-par total is the lowest score at any US Open at Winged Foot. He carded just one bogey today, and finished at least level in every round. He was, in truth, the only player to master this ferociously tough course over the last four days. After bulking up and coming back to the Tour swinging, DeChambeau winning a major was always going to shake up the game. Winning in such dominant, decisive fashion could permanently change the landscape of golf. DeChambeau says it\u2019s \u201can honour\u201d to join the list with Nicklaus and Woods. He\u2019s full of praise for coach Chris Como, who he credits with the transformation in his physique and technique that has led him here. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of hard work,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo be in that company, it\u2019s special, I\u2019ll forever appreciate that. On nine, that was the first time I thought \u2018this could be a reality\u2019. I shocked myself by making that eagle putt, but then I told myself \u2018no\u2019. Just play the next hole.\u201d Presentation time! DeChambeau puts on the Jack Nicklaus medal, and lifts the US Open trophy. \u201cOh my gosh, I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d he says. Bryson starts by thanking his sponsors, his backroom team - and he also has words of encouragement for John Pak, the leading amateur in this year\u2019s tournament. DeChambeau is the third player to win the US amateur title and the US Open; the other two are Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. DeChambeau showed barely a flicker of emotion out there, but the sight of his parents on a video screen sets him off. \u201cThank you for sacrificing everything for me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard for this, you deserve it so much,\u201d says Mum. \u201cDo you know how many records you just set?\u201d says Dad. It must be a little weird for Bryson not having the family here. DeChambeau 274 (69-68-70-67) -6 Wolff 280 (66-74-65-75) E Oosthuizen 282 (67-74-68-73) 282 English 283 (68-70-72-73) 283 Schauffele 284 (68-72-70-74) 284 T6: D Johnson, Zalatoris 285. T8: Finau, Thomas, Simpson, Z Johnson, McIlroy 286. Can Matthew Wolff, who saw his title dream trampled, at least finish with a birdie? No - it misses by a couple of inches. That means he ends the day five-over, and bang on par for the week. He\u2019s also finished second at his first US Open, a fine achievement. He didn\u2019t do a whole lot wrong today; DeChambeau was just on another level. A second bogey of the round would be absolutely fine, but Bryson wants more - and rolls in the par putt to complete a spectacular, dominant win! The walk to the 18th green as a major winner isn\u2019t usually like this - only a polite ripple of applause meets the champion-elect as he climbs the hill. His pitch up onto the green looks to have drifted, but spins back to within six feet. He\u2019ll have a par putt to seal the deal ... That miss means DeChambeau has hit 23 fairways this week - an all-time US Open low, beating \u00c1ngel Cabrera\u2019s 2007 tally of 27. His second shot rolls away from the green - one of very few outright mistakes he\u2019s made today. It won\u2019t matter. DeChambeau\u2019s final tee shot of this US Open is a fraction off the fairway. \u201cDamn, I wanted to hit that fairway\u201d, he mutters, still scribbling furiously in his notepad. Finally, a hint that he knows it\u2019s close. \u201cMom, Dad, Garrett [his brother], love ya. One more hole.\u201d Bad golf logos. No further comment. DeChambeau is in an awkward spot on the lip of a greenside bunker, and has a lengthy chat with the referee about taking a drop. Wolff just wants this over with, rolling his birdie putt up and tidying up for par. The champion-elect does the same, and takes a six-shot lead onto the final hole. Xander Schauffele\u2019s day did not pan out as planned, but a fifth-placed finish means he has placed in the top six at his first four US Opens. The last player to do that was Bobby Jones, back in the 1920s. Oosthuizen and Matsuyama, the penultimate pair to go out, have had very different days. The South African birdies the 18th to finish above English in third, just two over par. Matsuyama, a real contender going into the final day, finished eight over par, tied for 17th. On duff logos, Scott Blair says: \u201cJack Nicklaus has an actual Golden Bear as the logo on his Nicklaus Companies website. I\u2019d be far more ostentatious than both of them, if I was famously successful at, well, anything.\u201d Harris English ends a superb week with a disappointing three-putt, missing the chance to finish third outright. He never really threatened to take the trophy home, but it\u2019s been a great under-the-radar effort from a player who was fighting for his PGA Tour card not so long ago. Wolff\u2019s double bogey means DeChambeau is the only player under par - either for the day, or the whole week. He\u2019s been absolutely dominant, and I doff my flat, Puma-emblazoned chapeau to him. -6: DeChambeau (16) E: Wolff (16) +2: English (17) +3: Oosthuizen (17) DeChambeau powers onto the green with his second shot, then feathers his putt to within an inch of the cup. He\u2019s played that hole perfectly. Wolff is left with a tough six-foot putt for bogey, and you know what\u2019s coming next. It drifts wide right, and DeChambeau leads by six. He can enjoy the ride now; he\u2019s going to be the US Open champion. McIlroy misses a birdie chance at the 18th to wind up on a dispiriting six-over. He\u2019s tied for eighth with a host of other big names: Justin Thomas, Tony Finau, Dustin and Zack Johnson. McIlroy\u2019s figures rather tell the story of his week: 67-76-68-75. A sad end to a fine week for Norway\u2019s Viktor Hovland, who was chasing a top-five finish. Bogey-double-double to end seven-over par. Xander Schauffele has also hit the skids as his slim title hopes disappeared - he\u2019s bogeyed his last five holes. To the 16th! It\u2019s a 498-yard monster with an awkward dogleg. DeChambeau simply wallops the ball over it, a full 365 yards. Yeesh! Wolff\u2019s tee shot looks tame by comparison, and drops into the rough. He knows it\u2019s over, bar an absolutely spectacular collapse. I very much agree with this - although I\u2019ve just twigged that DeChambeau\u2019s logo is his profile, complete with flat cap. And it\u2019s on his flat cap. That\u2019s a bit meta for me. Individual logos for athletes. Bad or bad? Discuss. Another effortless iron shot sets up a birdie chance for DeChambeau on the 15th. It\u2019s a good 30ft out, but rolling gently downhill. He sends it a foot wide - poor by his standards - but is left a tiddler for par. Wolff stays with him - that\u2019s all he can do now - and DeChambeau holds onto his four-shot lead. Going into the final round, you could have argued DeChambeau was under more pressure than anyone. Wolff was the leader, but there\u2019s no shame in falling short on your debut - and everyone else was hoping for a chance to come their way. As DeChambeau steadfastly refused to buckle, they\u2019ve fallen away one by one. His game is not the prettiest to watch, and it\u2019s been mighty slow at times today - but I admire any athlete who is prepared to rebuild their game to give themselves the best chance of winning. -6: DeChambeau (14) -2: Wolff (14) +2: English (15), Oosthuizen (15) DeChambeau makes no mistake, and now leads the US Open by four shots! Everything is coming up Bryson: third-placed Louis Oosthuizen narrowly misses a par putt at the 15th, and is now eight shots behind. Wolff plays up and down onto the green, but leaves himself a 12-footer uphill to rescue par. It breaks left and Wolff waits for it to break back right, but it never does. DeChambeau, who chipped artfully out of the rough, suddenly has a chance from a similar distance to go four clear ... The leading pair\u2019s straits are not quite as dire as I suggested - they\u2019re on a gentle incline, just left of the fairway. Time for a spot of gouging. DeChambeau can\u2019t find the green, the rough just a little too thick. Wolff gets onto the green, but watches the ball roll, roll, roll away. He\u2019s not getting much luck out there. Elsewhere, a nerve-tester for Louis Oosthuizen, who must sink an awkward 10-footer to save par and stay on one-over. And sink it he does! In 90 minutes\u2019 time, that might be huge. Or it might not. No such luck for Harris English, who can\u2019t get enough curl on a downhill, right-to-left par putt. DeChambeau and Wolff head to the 14th, perhaps the toughest tee shot of the remaining five holes. The leader\u2019s effort sails 300 yards but drifts left, landing in a ditch over to the left. A chance for Wolff, but to his immense frustration, he ends up in virtually the same spot. The bogeys keep on coming - Schauffele slips back to two over, Viktor Hovland to three over. DeChambeau can afford to pump the brakes, pushing his birdie putt on the enormous 13th green to within six feet. Wolff has a better chance for birdie, but comes up six inches short - and another hole is out of the way for DeChambeau, who still leads by three. Speaking of which, Rory McIlroy can\u2019t land an awkward downhill par putt at the 15th, and slips back to +4. He\u2019s tied for seventh with playing partner Zach Johnson - not a bad week at all, but what might have been, eh. Killian Morgan offers another reason why DeChambeau, aka The Scientist, looks set to prevail: \u201cIt\u2019s a laboratory out there. Without a crowd it becomes a less emotional event so the nerd will prevail, I guess. Awful, mechanical to watch but jeez he\u2019s going to get it done isn\u2019t he?\u201d That\u2019s a little harsh - the power hitting and slow play can take you so far, but he\u2019s showed plenty of skill and composure around the greens, where so many of his rivals have come undone. -6: DeChambeau (12) -3: Wolff (12) +1: Schauffele (13), English (13), Oosthuizen (13) +2: Hovland (15) A tough break for Wolff, whose excellent approach shot catches the wrong part of an undulating green and spins some 20ft back. He\u2019s not happy, dropping an F-bomb or two on his long walk up to the green. His birdie effort is close, but not close enough. DeChambeau has a chance to extend his lead with an extreme left-to-right breaker. It\u2019s wide of the mark, but he\u2019ll tap in for par. Wolff at least rolls in a tricky par to keep the margin at three shots. Can anybody from the chasing pack put pressure on our leader? He\u2019s still capable of blowing up, even if there\u2019s been no sign today. Oosthuizen is heading in the wrong direction, caught up in rough on the 12th but scrambling to save par. At the 13th, a tremendously tricky up-and-down green causes both Schauffele and English to drop shots. They\u2019re now seven shots behind DeChambeau. Has \u2018The Scientist\u2019 found the formula for a first major? DeChambeau\u2019s power has attracted headlines, but his coolness and consistency have got him into this position. All the more impressive given his struggles just a couple of months ago: ... because from the back of the green, DeChambeau rolls in a brilliant birdie to go three shots clear! He\u2019s turned a two-shot deficit into a three-shot advantage, and is now undeniably the man to beat. Wolff is in the right spot, but he can\u2019t execute his approach shot with the wedge, sending it into rough to the right of the green. A poor effort, but he recovers by digging out for a chance at par. DeChambeau is onto the green from his own particular spot of bother, but feels like the bounce was unfair. \u201cThat\u2019s too soft!\u201d he bellows. \u201cThat was a great shot.\u201d Positivity is everything ... DeChambeau\u2019s tee shot on the 11th zips dangerously close to a bunker, coming to rest in rough just in front of the sand trap. Wolff can\u2019t match his opponent for distance, but finds a better line and rocks up nicely on the fairway. As for Rory McIlroy, he continues a tidy round with pars at the 12th and 13th. That opening double bogey looks to have left him too much to do - he\u2019s eight shots behind leader DeChambeau. \u201cHow?!\u201d shouts an irked Matthew Wolff, as his par putt fades left. He\u2019s seen a couple of those drift away today, and DeChambeau punishes him. A rare defensive putt sets him up for par, and a two-shot lead! Elsewhere, Dustin Johnson signs off with an even-par 70. He finishes the tournament five over; if not for going three-over on the opening day, he would have been right in the mix. Can we now call this a two-horse race? Maybe not quite yet. Wolff ends up in a horrible spot on the 10th; he\u2019s in thick rough, and has to chop it out with an almost horizontal swing. Smoother sailing for DeChambeau, and he\u2019s lining up a 40ft birdie putt as the shadows begin to lengthen. Harris English has been battling hard since that unfortunate double-bogey on the first, and he tickles in a birdie at the 11th to get back to level par. Meanwhile, Louis Oosthuizen gives himself too much to do on the 10th green, and drops a shot. That means there are four men under par for the week, and all four are American. -5: DeChambeau (9) -4: Wolff (9) E: Schauffele (11), English (11) +1: Oosthuizen (10) That passage of play had echoes of Wolff\u2019s maiden PGA Tour title, last year\u2019s 3M Open. DeChambeau sank an eagle, and Wolff immediately followed suit: Eagle for DeChambeau! With Wolff waiting for his eagle chance, his rival sizes up a long-range effort... and sinks it. What a body blow that could be - but Wolff matches it with an eagle of his own! Absolute nerves of steel from the 21-year-old, and he stays within one. On the par-five ninth, DeChambeau absolutely hammers his tee shot, and follows it up with an approach shot that leaves him some 40ft short of the pin. Wolff\u2019s second effort is even better, stopping dead around 20ft north of the pin ... -3: DeChambeau (8) -2: Wolff (8) E: Oosthuizen (9), Schauffele (10) +1: English (10) +3: Thomas (16), Hovland (11), McIlroy (11) Another birdie for Rory at the 11th - that\u2019s two in his last three - and he joins Justin Thomas and Viktor Hovland in the they-couldn\u2019t-could-they group on three over. More encouragement for the chasing pack, as Bryson DeChambeau can\u2019t sink that tricky par putt. A chance for Wolff to regain a share of the lead - but his easier chance squeaks left of the cup. Oof, that was a chance. I would say that the leading pair have profited from attacking play, although that big bounce DeChambeau just got tells us the greens are firming up. It\u2019s still better than spending Sunday on Mitcham Common - but what isn\u2019t? Wolff has a birdie putt from 97ft, so it\u2019s all about getting close - which he does, rolling up to within four feet. DeChambeau chips out of the thick grass, and ends up a couple of feet behind his rival. A tricky par putt coming up ... DeChambeau drifts a few inches into rough on the eighth, and this time his follow-up shot has a little too much swazz, bouncing into a tricky spot off the back of the green. At the ninth, Xander Schauffele nicks a birdie to end his front nine even, and join Oosthuizen on level-par. Steady as she goes. Niall McVeigh stepping back in after a quick trip to the clubhouse. Here\u2019s Chris Collinson: \u201cLoving the golf but hating the awful library music being used on every cutaway to a leaderboard or ad break. Golf music on UK TV has long been in double-bogey territory compared to the peerless clubhouse leader, ITV4\u2019s cycling coverage.\u201d It\u2019s a bit old-fashioned but I guess it fits the bill. Much as I\u2019d like a bit of tech-house between holes, I\u2019m not sure it would work. A very respectable effort on Wolff\u2019s 50ft birdie attempt on the seventh. He gets to within a few feet of the hole, and then makes par. Meanwhile, DeChambeau is just off the green but can still use the putter for his second shot, and also gets within a few feet of the flag. He rolls it in to stay at -4. Ooisthuizen, in third place, sinks back to even for the tournament after dropping a shot on the eighth. Rory McIlroy misses an eagle putt by a couple of feet but he\u2019s in seventh place on +4 after the back nine after making the birdie attempt. The par-three seventh now for the top-two. DeChambeau\u2019s tee shot leaves him just off the green, while Wolff uses a pitching wedge, which leaves him well short of the flag but just about on the green. \u201cIt\u2019s a still a good shot,\u201d says DeChambeau after getting out of a tricky lie on the sixth. If you can\u2019t love yourself, who can you love? Wolff has a 20ft birdie putt to cancel out that bogey on the previous hole. It\u2019s not a great effort and it\u2019s hit well to the right of the hole. I\u2019m not sure what he was trying to do and he appeared to misread the green. He redeems himself by saving par. DeChambeau picks up a short putt for par and retains his one-shot lead. Elsewhere, Ooisthuizen collects a par on the par-three seventh to remain in touching distance of the leaders. Ooisthuizen is not out of it yet. His birdie on the sixth takes him to -1 and he\u2019s now three shots off the lead. With much more experience than the two men in front of him, and Wolff looking wobbly, there\u2019s still a chance for the South African to put a run together. Wolff\u2019s third shot is out of the bunker on the par-four fifth. He gets out well enough, but he\u2019s left with a tricky downhill 10ft putt to make par, which he ... misses. He\u2019s now bogeyed the two of the last three holes. Meanwhile, DeChambeau, has a 90ft putt to make birdie. We\u2019ll forgive him for not making it. There\u2019s a 6ft putt for him to make par and become the sole leader at -4. He sinks it too - DeChambeau now leads the US Open! On the 18th, Jon Rahm\u2019s bogey means he finished the tournament +9. DeChambeau is in the bunker 233 yards from the flag on the fifth and manages to get to the front of the green, he\u2019ll have a very long putt for birdie but should make par. Wolff is so, so close to a birdie here, playing from the back of the fourth green to avoid some of its trickier spots. Can DeChambeau take a share of the lead? He can, draining his 12-foot birdie chance. Wolff has done little wrong, but his partner looks the man to beat - and both men are four clear of the pack. With that, I\u2019m handing over to Tom Lutz for a spell. Here\u2019s the latest leaderboard: -4: Wolff (4), DeChambeau (4) Even: Oosthuizen (4) +1: English (5) +2: Schauffele (5) DeChambeau\u2019s approach shot is another beauty, finding the sweet spot on the green. Wolff\u2019s effort drifts a touch, but just as it looks to be rolling out of range, the backspin kicks in. What a battle this is shaping up to be. Elsewhere, first-round leader Justin Thomas creeps back into the top 10 with a birdie to go four-over for the week. Alex Nor\u00e9n, who hit a superb 67 on Saturday, has returned to his Friday form. He\u2019s five-over through eight holes today. The leading duo are taking on the fourth hole, a par-four with an unusual square green. Oosthuizen, who was the only other player still under par, has three-putted said green to slip back to even par. Word on Sky is that Winged Foot club members are disappointed with the low scores this week. Really?! Wolff gives himself the chance to rescue par, but a gettable putt just squirms away at the last. He\u2019s down to four-under, leading DeChambeau by one. On the fifth, McIlroy gets close with an up-down, up-down, long-range birdie putt that is practically impossible. Schauffele has dropped a shot at the fourth while Hideki Matsuyama, a model of consistency this week, has started double, bogey, bogey to drift to +4. A first wobble from Wolff, who skews his tee shot on the third horribly. He\u2019ll need something special to avoid dropping a shot here ... but he might have found it, drilling his second through the trees and finding the green. He was brave to take that on. DeChambeau also in a spot of bother, but chips exquisitely from the rough to within a couple of feet. Wolff and DeChambeau, leading pair and upmarket wine producers, tackle the second hole. Both find the fairway, and lay up on either side of the green. Both roll up to within a foot on a plate-glass green, and do the necessary for par. They look like they\u2019re playing a different course to everyone else right now. McIlroy gets in a great position off his tee shot on the fourth, but fouls it up with a mishit approach shot that drifts left and drops short of the green. It ends up costing him another shot, and he\u2019s out to +4, nine shots off Wolff and all but out of the running. Jon Rahm (+7) was the only player out on the course under-par ... but he\u2019s just bogeyed the 14th. That means nobody is under par for the day. This is a US Open, alright. The only man above Rahm in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, nails an eagle chance at the ninth, and he\u2019s five-over for the week. He\u2019s even for the day, with figures of 73-70-72 - not bad for someone who has never really been in contention here. Fine work by Xander Schauffele on the second, getting up and down from a tricky bunker to save another par. He\u2019s even-par for the week - who knows, it might be enough? Even better news for Harris English, who gets one back as his lay-up runs all the way to the cup. Leaderboard: -5: Wolff (1) -3: DeChambeau (1) -1: Oosthuizen (1) Even: Schauffele (2) +1: English (2) +2: Matsuyama (1) On an opening hole that has given the chasing pack so much grief, Wolff and DeChambeau both find the heart of the green with their second shots! The leader is a few feet further south, and two-putts for an opening par. Can Bryson put a little pressure on? He takes on a four-footer ... sent wide left. McIlroy tidies up at the second, to loud cheers from the few fans massed behind the Winged Foot fence. Zach Johnson lays up from a bunker and watches his ball trickle mercilessly back downhill, away from the hole. He opts against going full Danny Lee, instead rescuing a bogey. Double bogey for Matsuyama, who can\u2019t recover from a poor tee shot. A third double at the first in quick succession after McIlroy and English. Oosthuizen drains a ten-foot par to stay at -1 and keep the leading pair from getting too comfortable. \u201cEvening Niall.\u201d Good evening, Simon McMahon. \u201cPo\u2019 Danny Lee (see 17.25). Golf, eh? Bloody hell. Which one of you is Danny Lee? I am Danny Lee.\u201d Safe to say, one way or another, we\u2019ve all been there. Here come our leading pair! Bryson DeChambeau begins two shots behind Matthew Wolff, and blasts his tee shot straight as an arrow, onto the fairway. A solid start is so important for the overnight leader ... and he gets it, that twitchy, quick swing delivering a perfect opening drive. They finally found Harris English\u2019s ball! Alas, it\u2019s well outside the three-minute time limit, and English is already busy mopping up for a double-bogey. Schauffele takes a par, a fine effort given the scenes unfolding around him. Oosthuizen and Matsuyama get to tee off just a few minutes late. The South African is inches from the fairway, with his playing partner drifting further into the rough. At the second, McIlroy makes up for an errant tee shot with a delicate chip onto the green - he\u2019s on course for a welcome par. And if you thought that was a bad start ... Harris English is unable to locate his ball in thick rough off the first, and will have to go back to the tee for his second shot. That means Oosthuizen and Matsuyama are left waiting to start their rounds. English\u2019s first effort was not miles off-track; if fans were here, someone would have seen it land. McIlroy\u2019s second shot on the first gets him to the edge of the green; the trouble is, said green is the size of an overflow car park, and he has to play uphill and downwind. His putt is underhit, and rolls back downhill. He ends up with a tricky six-footer just to save bogey - and misses. Double bogey for McIlroy, and a hammer blow to his hopes. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re up against on the very first hole. Schauffele and English have just teed off, both finding the rough just left of the fairway as it tapers. It\u2019s a tough start, alright. Another up-and-comer, Chilean 21-year-old Joaqu\u00edn Niemann, double-bogeyed the first but bounces back at the third, with a tee shot that is very, very close to a hole-in-one. Perhaps golf, like cycling, is unexpectedly becoming a young person\u2019s game ... Matthew Wolff is out on the driving range, fiddling with his phone and trying not to look bothered. At the first, fellow young gun Viktor Hovland plays out of a bunker and misses the cup by inches - but tidies up for par. McIlroy powers his opening tee shot straight down the middle of the fairway. Johnson doesn\u2019t fare so well, sending his effort way, way off to the left. For those of you asking why there have been no Rory McIlroy updates: he\u2019s not started yet. Teeing off in five minutes, alongside Zach Johnson. Reed has bogeyed the second and slipped back to +3. Matthew Wolff and Bryson DeChambeau have plenty in common. Both were born in California; both made their major breakthrough at August\u2019s PGA Championship, finishing tied for fourth, three shots behind winner Collin Morikawa. Both players are also fans of the \u201cgrip and rip\u201d style, favouring power and distance over precision approach play. Of the 42 fairways they\u2019ve faced so far, DeChambeau has found 17, Wolff just 12 - but their big-hitting game has repeatedly got them out of trouble. Patrick Reed\u2019s back-nine meltdown on Saturday saw him drop eight shots and fall apparently out of contention - but he\u2019s birdied the first today to get back to +2. Is a heartwarming comeback on for the plucky Texan? Here\u2019s what Winged Foot\u2019s tricky greens can do to a golfer. New Zealand\u2019s Danny Lee had a par putt to finish eight-over yesterday. Six shots later: After giving his bag of clubs a damn good thrashing, Lee withdrew from the tournament. That\u2019s what golf do to ya! More than 40 players are out on the course, and as it stands, just two are under par for their round: Erik van Rooyen and Lucas Herbert, who have both improved to +9 for the week. That suggests Winged Foot is set to bite back after a kinder Saturday. Here are the pin positions; plenty tucked away to make life difficult for Wolff and DeChambeau\u2019s power game. Plenty of players are already out on the course, but the contenders will start getting under way in around an hour. All times are BST, local times are fivehours behind - so the leaders go off at 1.30pm, EST. 5.13pm: Patrick Reed (+3) &amp; Thomas Pieters (+3) 5.24pm: Joaqu\u00edn Niemann (+3) &amp; Webb Simpson (+3) 5.35pm: Lucas Glover (+3) &amp; Alex Nor\u00e9n (+3) 5.46pm: Viktor Hovland (+2) &amp; Rafa Cabrera-Bello (+2) 5.57pm: Rory McIlroy (+1) &amp; Zach Johnson (+2) 6.08pm: Xander Schauffele (E) &amp; Harris English (E) 6.19pm: Louis Oosthuizen (-1) &amp; Hideki Matsuyama (E) 6.30pm: Matthew Wolff (-5) &amp; Bryson DeChambeau (-3) Hello, and welcome to the final day of the 120th US Open Championship. This could be a red-letter day, not just for the player who emerges victorious, but for the game of golf in general. Matthew Wolff and Bryson DeChambeau will head out as the final pair after taking on a brutally tough course with power and ambition. Winged Foot is perhaps the ultimate purists\u2019 challenge, where hitting fairways and making pars are key to success. The leading duo have ripped up that rule book, and a first major for either today might persuade others to change their game. That said, the USGA won\u2019t make it easy for the week\u2019s power couple today, and the overnight leaders on Thursday and Friday - Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed - dramatically lost their way. There\u2019s plenty of hope for the chasing pack, with Louis Oosthuizen and Rory McIlroy among them. Here\u2019s the leaderboard as it stands: -5: Wolff -3: DeChambeau -1: Oosthuizen Even: English, Matsuyama, Schauffele +1: McIlroy +2: Cabrera-Bello, Z Johnson, Hovland"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
