Now comes Wu Legends, a partial reunion of the Wu's most powerful elements. In the early-90s, the Staten Island crew patented a blend of raw minimalist beats and eastern fantasy that turned their gritty urban narratives into tales of great mystery and heroism. This tour gathers the Clan's most eloquent MCs: Method Man, omniscient GZA, hardcore Raekwon and consummate Ghostface Killah to bask in their own dexterity and celebrate their fleeting empire. The Ritz, Manchester, Sat; Button Factory, Dublin, Sun, Newport Centre, Mon John Robinson Dr John, On tour Just like the Stone Roses, Mac Rebennack \u2013 AKA New Orleans musician Dr John \u2013 has found it hard to live up to his debut album. Since the spooky, groovy Gris Gris (1968), there have been bluesy records, \"fonky\" records, and standards records, but it's only on new one Locked Down that he's captured that old voodoo magic. Produced by Black Keys man Dan Auerbach, it draws on Mac's own biography (drug addiction; prison) and the things that ground him (family; talent). Don't expect a facile return to former glories, but a strong modern set by a singularly valuable artist. Under The Bridge, SW6, Wed &amp; Thu; SummerTyne Americana Festival, Sage Gateshead, Fri JR Neneh Cherry &amp; The Thing, London Anyone who saw Neneh Cherry as the opening act at the Glastonbury festival 15 years ago, performing in wellies and a nightdress, will already know that the singer can transform some pretty hostile environments. Already a post-punk and punk-funk pioneer (as the teenage singer with Bristol's Rip, Rig + Panic), and a bona fide pop star (via late-80s hits including Buffalo Stance), here Cherry connects with another part of her heritage: punk and jazz. From Scandinavia, the Thing specialise in fruity free jazz dust-ups, and have covered work by free/spirutual jazz pioneer Don Cherry (Neneh's stepfather). Here, the two factions meet on some feisty, punky covers (Stooges; Suicide; hip-hopper MF DOOM), while Cherry's own composition Cashback showcases her considerable vocal power, happily undiminished during a 15-year break from recording. Village Underground, EC2, Sun JR Jazz At Cafe Society, London Cafe Society was America's first racially integrated nightclub, opening in 1938 in New York's Greenwich Village to showcase the era's new jazz and folk music. Widely known for being the venue in which Billie Holiday first sang Strange Fruit, Cafe Society also helped launch the careers of stars including Sarah Vaughan and Lena Horne. This fascinating story was celebrated at last year's London Jazz Festival as a musical by pianist-composer Alex Webb with vocalists China Moses (taking the Billie Holiday part), Gwyneth Herbert and Alexander Stewart, plus input from saxophonist Frank Griffith and a sharp and swinging London ensemble. Classic songs associated with blues singer Big Joe Turner, folk artist Josh White and gospel guitar hero Sister Rosetta Tharpe also figure in an intelligent, imaginative and fast-moving piece of jazz theatre. Tricycle Theatre, NW6, Mon to 21 Jul John Fordham John Surman, Manchester The Manchester Jazz Festival \u2013 an operation that punches above its weight in adventurous pan-European programming \u2013 runs until 21 July at various venues around the city. There's plenty of high-energy and danceable music, but an intimate solo performance of his new Saltash Bells album by UK saxophone master John Surman is one of the festival's major attractions. It's 18 years since Surman last made an unaccompanied album, and his current set represents a return to the West Country of his childhood, in the shape of chiming church bells, frozen-woodland reveries, and folk dances in which soprano sax, improv clarinet riffs and percussive synth rhythms are overlaid. Royal Northern College Of Music, Wed JF G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, Moreton-in-Marsh Ever since they began hosting a summer opera season as Banks Fee Opera in 1991, presenting productions of Wagner's operas was the long-term goal of Martin and Lizzie Graham's Longborough Festival. That lofty ambition started to take concrete form in 2007, when the first part of the Ring cycle, Das Rheingold, was performed in the theatre that the Grahams had built, surely one of the Cotswolds' most original barn conversions. Die Walk\u00fcre and Siegfried followed in 2010 and 2011, and this week their grand project reaches fulfilment with the final part of the tetralogy, G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. Planning is already underway for complete cycles next year. As before, Anthony Negus, one of Britain's most experienced and underrated Wagner conductors, is in the pit; the production is directed by Alan Privett.
