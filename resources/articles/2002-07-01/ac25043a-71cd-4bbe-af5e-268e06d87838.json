His advice is this. By all means rock. But stay away from rocking it. \"You have to try not to rock it,\" he says, down the line from a hotel room in Stockholm. \"You end up drinking every day. Or I do. But my thing is to stick to the one brand - if you're on vodka and tonic, then don't start thinking you're invincible at two in the morning and decide to go back on beer.\" Because that would be rocking it, and to help explain why that might not be a good idea, here's a summary of what Doves have been up to in the last few days. They've been to the Glastonbury Festival. Then Norway. Tonight they're in Sweden. Then tomorrow it's Denmark. Then Belgium. Then they come home. But they're making a video. Then they go to Australia. Then Japan. Doves get four days off a month. \"I don't know how bands with kids do it,\" Jimi continues. \"If you're home for four days, you just have to pack it all in. You see your mum and dad, your grandma. See your mates. Pay your bills, and wash your clobber, and then you're off again...\" But Doves - that's Jimi, along with musical partners Andy and Jez Williams - don't mind at all. In February, they completed an album called The Last Broadcast that's likely to prove one of the very best released this year, and one they consider themselves to be \"damn fucking proud of\". Quite simply, they feel that they would be doing their album a disservice if they were to keep it to themselves. The story of Doves, however, does not begin with The Last Broadcast. Formerly known as Sub Sub, whose Ain't No Love, Ain't No Use was a No 3 hit in 1993, Doves didn't so much form as develop from their previous group. Sub Sub had been straining to take themselves in new directions - they included a card in the sleeve of the collaborative record they made with Tricky that said, basically, \"Sub Sub Want To Find A Singer\" - but had yet to make the quantum leap into realising they could do the job themselves. When they did, the music that they began to make was definitely something very different. These were the songs that became the first Doves album, Lost Souls, and they seemed to speak volumes about the state the group was in at the time. \"It was our, 'I'm 28, what's happening with my life?' album,\" says Jimi. \"Things happen at once. You split up with a girl, your fucking studio burns down... you're just looking at the sky wondering what's gonna happen next, man. Bring it on! Being serious, though - (New Order manager) Rob Gretton, who basically funded and supported Doves, two days after the album came out, he had a heart attack and died. A lot of shit happened. \"Lost Souls was written under a bit of a cloud,\" Jimi continues. \"We were desperate to do the things that bands do, like tour. We longed to be like that, but it didn't pan out. We went to gigs in Manchester when Sub Sub was turning into Doves, and we went to see Supergrass at the Hacienda and were thinking, these three kids are having a fucking ball. And we were just getting in the car and going and putting in nine hours work in a studio with no windows.\" Despite the bleak circumstances around its conception, however, Lost Souls allowed Doves to begin to see the light. Critically acclaimed - and commercially so, too, the album selling 160,000 copies - the reputation of the group spread by word of mouth, and slowly Doves were back in a position of prominence. Out on the road, where they wanted to be. And back in the limelight, where they had begun to suspect they may not be again. The group's grown confidence is written into their new album, The Last Broadcast. A number one in the UK, the album's rapturous reception has, however, had one downside. It has made the group think about what annoys them - and what annoys them, chiefly, is the use of adjectives. Their music, \"grand\" in scope, \"epic\" in stature, and lent an air of sadness by the fragility of much of the singing (these duties are shared out fairly evenly), has, after all, given rise to a fairly stock set of critical responses. Doves, previously \"introspective\" and \"melancholic\", are now found, on their new album, to be \"upbeat\". There's an element of truth to this, certainly. There Goes The Fear, the album's opening track, is, well, an \"epic\" song about banishing worry, while the new single, Pounding, inhabits a far more joyous landscape than we have hitherto been accustomed to hearing from the group. \"I get that a lot now,\" says Jimi. \"Doves in upbeat shocker! Bearded Mancunian miserabilists have got happy!\" This, funnily enough, is not something that Jimi's particularly happy about. \"I mean, what is fucking 'upbeat'? It's too easy man,\" he continues. \"People are more complex than that. Lost Souls was quite introspective, and it was quite cathartic when we got it out. There were a lot of frustrations about where we were going at that time in our lives.\" This time, things were rather different. As good as Lost Souls was, the band still consider it to be a workmanlike achievement, and that for their new album, a new way of going about things had to be found. Rather than working in their windowless studio, they instead recorded it in a number of different locations (in the case of the vocals for M62 Song, under a flyover) and created a different sort of atmosphere altogether. \"It was unconsciously there,\" Jimi explains. \"We're always on the hunt for a new vibe. With The Last Broadcast , it may have been a conversation we had early on, like - this one could do with being more direct. I know how much effort went into it, recording it and getting it right, but I can't hear the labour, the nuts and bolts, which is great. There are some songs I can still listen to as a fan...\" And there is great labour involved. The Last Broadcast, as well as being a terrific record, is also truly a group effort - all of the members write the songs - and this parity among the group's members can make it all quite a time-consuming business. \"We all have our own input, and that's what takes the time,\" says Jimi. New single Pounding is born of this process. Jez brought a demo from home and the group wrote the lyrics together. And, yes, it is \"upbeat\". \"It's throwaway, really - the very fact that we get away with saying the word 'baby', being Mancs,\" he smiles. \"It's a real bubble-gum thing - New Order meets Tamla Motown. Not everything has to be profound.\" The last few gigs have been pretty good, actually. Jimi spent Glastonbury in three places: on stage, in a Portacabin, and in a tent being interviewed, with no oppportunity to rock it. Gothenberg, he says, was good, but strange, because the band didn't come on until 12.30am, and by then most of the crowd had gone home, too drunk to continue. In a few hour's time Doves will take to the stage here in Stockholm - a No 1 album behind them, and new converts to make. And The Last Word? \"People say, 'What's it like, man?'\" says Jimi. \"It's pretty great. But we just haven't got time to sit and pat ourselves on the back...\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
