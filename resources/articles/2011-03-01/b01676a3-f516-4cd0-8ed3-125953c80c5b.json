There are a few instances of the showy electronics-noodling from Zawinul and absent-minded gap-filling from Shorter's sax that was to blunt Weather Report's jazz edge as its rock-audience grew. But as the show warms up, the players find that balance of spacious tone-poetry, incisive improv and infectious hook-playing that was the essence of their best performances. The opening Freezing Fire is a sprint for splashy synth effects and frenzied percussion, but Zawinul's Scarlet Woman is the epitome of subtle story-development, coloured by the composer's panpipe sounds and embraced by Alphonso Johnson's rich electric bass, and Mysterious Traveller a vehicle for some gutsy Shorter tenor sax. The 20-minute closing medley of an impassioned Badia and a jubilant Boogie Woogie Waltz, prefaced by a flowing acoustic piano passage eventually joined by smoky tenor sax, shows exactly how inspirationally Weather Report blurred genre differences, and improv/written differences, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
