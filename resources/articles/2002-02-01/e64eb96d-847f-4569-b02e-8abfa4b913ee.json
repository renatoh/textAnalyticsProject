But it hardly served as an excuse for defeat. England's batsmen, in their first outing in New Zealand, were sufficiently adjusted for them to amass 288 for six, with Nick Knight hitting 126, his second century in eight days. The seam bowling, though, was poor - off line, frequently too short and generally shoddy apart from one stupendous later over from Darren Gough that briefly threatened to turn the game round when it was all but lost. The fielding, too, was well below par, presenting the Northern Knights (Northern Districts by another name) with 11 overthrows. The Knights got the jitters as a stirring victory approached, losing three late wickets for one run. But the pace bowler Daryl Tuffey clipped a couple of boundaries off Craig White's last over and Grant Bradburn - at 35 the oldest first-class cricketer in the land - then lifted the first ball of the final over from Jeremy Snape high over extra-cover and into the crowd for the winning runs. If England trooped off a little dejectedly, then it is as well to keep things in perspective for the Westpac Trust Park pitch was outstanding, with good pace and carry, and a world away from the surfaces these tourists have encountered for most of the past two winters. Afterwards Marcus Trescothick, carrying the mantle of Alec Stewart by opening the batting, keeping wicket in the absence of Jamie Foster and leading the side with Nasser Hussain having a rest, was reluctant to place too much emphasis on the defeat. He pointed out that England's total was an excellent one, even if aspects of play - the bowling and fielding - needed working on. \"I'm sure that the pace bowlers got a little excited at suddenly coming across a pitch with some life in it,\" he said, \"and that had something to do with the performance. But let's give the opposition some credit. We do need to learn how to bowl to certain fields and in certain ways, especially with the new ball.\" Bradburn's unbeaten 43 saw the Knights home but the win in what was the ground's first big match under new lights - it will shortly stage cricket's first floodlit four-day game - was set up by two innings of character but with such differing characteristics that the qualities of chalk and cheese would seem indistinguishable by comparison. Underpinning the run chase was Michael Parlane's superbly paced 79, beginning in the 12th over and ended by White when only a dozen runs were needed. It was an innings that at the start, when he laboured 20 overs for only that many runs, appeared to be taking the game away from his side but that blossomed when he decided the time was ripe. More remarkable was the phenomenal hitting at the start from Simon Doull, once one of New Zealand's most skilful pace bowlers but with no batting pedigree in 32 Tests and 42 one-day internationals. Now, following a serious knee injury, he has been reinvented as a top-order biffer. What a difference an \"o\" can make to a name. His 80 took only 47 balls, with two sixes hit off Andy Caddick and 11 fours, a few of them streaky but for the most part pinging off his bat with immense power. With Matthew Hoggard, Gough and Caddick all being roughed up, Doull's innings knocked the top off the run chase with Trescothick powerless to halt it. When Paul Collingwood was slogged to White at deep midwicket - Collingwood has shown massive improvement with the variety in his bowling - there was still one more over of the first 15 to be bowled before fielders could be pushed back. At halfway England must have felt they had the game under control. Knight batted with panache, running well, plundering the off-side as he generally does but picking up on the leg-side as well, batting in all for 125 balls with four sixes and10 fours. There was solid support from Trescothick (38) before he edged to slip and later, after Michael Vaughan had played scratchily, from Graham Thorpe, who made a typically unfussy 40, and Owais Shah, getting his first bat of the one- day leg of the winter, hitting 31 in a manner that concealed his lack of middle practice. That at least will throw another hat into the ring. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
