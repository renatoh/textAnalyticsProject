Swansea lost 3-0 at Newcastle, where they had plenty of possession and chances but lacked their opponents' cutting edge. Perhaps the biggest surprise for the 42,616 crowd was that Marlon Harewood played the major part in Swansea's destruction. The striker, with only one goal from his nine previous Newcastle matches following a loan move from Aston Villa, has been given a rough ride by the Newcastle fans. He said recently: \"I didn't expect to be treated like this here. But I'm a professional and I just have to overcome it and change people's opinions about me.\" He certainly went some way towards that against Swansea. He opened the scoring with a header from an Alan Smith cross and, after Peter Lovenkrands had made it 2-0, the Dane set up Harewood for another headed goal. The best individual striking performance, though, was at Bristol City, where Sheffield United's Darius Henderson scored the first hat-trick of his career to earn his team a remarkable victory. After City had levelled the score from 2-0 down Henderson, one of the Championship's most combative centre-forwards, scored United's winner in the sixth minute of stoppage time with the coolest of finishes from a Stephen Quinn pass. There was a similar late kick in the teeth for Leicester who, in a match they should have won comfortably, were held to a 1-1 draw by Scunthorpe thanks to a goal by substitute Martyn Woolford with the last kick of the game. QPR, too, should have done better than they did, at home to Coventry. Having turned a one-goal deficit into a 2-1 lead, slackness in the QPR defence allowed Richard Woods to mark his second Coventry appearance on loan from Sheffield Wednesday with his first goal for the club, nine minutes from the end. Coventry held on for a point despite having Stephen Wright sent off. The biggest win of the day in the Championship was West Brom's 4-0 demolition of Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, which took their recent goal tally to 15 in four matches. Wednesday were outclassed and nobody capitalised on this more than Simon Cox, who could easily have had a hat-trick. Instead, he had to be content with two goals, plus an assist for Jerome Thomas's strike. Nottingham Forest were another team to hit four, beating Doncaster 4-1. That win increased their unbeaten record to 10 matches and as a result they moved up to fourth from ninth. The unluckiest team \u2013 not to mention the unluckiest group of travelling fans (see below) \u2013 had to be Barnsley. After falling behind at Plymouth, Barnsley emphasised their improvement under the management of Mark Robins by producing superb attacking football in the incessant rain to score twice in the space of three minutes and go 4-1 up by half-time. However, after 58 minutes, with the pitch waterlogged, the match was abandoned. Peterborough, the other bottom-three team in action, twice came from behind for a 2-2 draw with Middlesbrough. Both of the visitors' goals were scored by Dave Kitson, his first for the club following his arrival on loan from Stoke. But Gordon Strachan was denied his first win as Middlesbrough manager by a spectacular 25-yard half-volley from Posh substitute Shaun Batt, 14 minutes from the end. Batt also brought himself a one-match suspension for collecting a fifth booking of the season after going into the crowd to celebrate his strike. That was not the end of the drama as Middlesbrough defender Sean St Ledger \u2013 a former Peterborough player \u2013 had a strong case for a penalty ignored after going down under a challenge from Aaron McLean."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
