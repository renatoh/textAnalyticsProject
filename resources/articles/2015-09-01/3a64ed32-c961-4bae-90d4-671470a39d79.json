Paulo Dybala converted a disputed penalty in the 83rd minute after Juan Cuadrado had been tripped to salvage a draw for the reigning Serie A champions. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fortunate time for us but I don\u2019t have anything to reproach the lads about,\u201d said the Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri, who rested several players with the Champions League in mind. \u201cNo one expected Juve to have only one point after three matches but there are also positive aspects.\u201d PSV thrashed 10-man Cambuur Leeuwarden 6-0 to boost confidence before their Champions League meeting with Manchester United and their former Eindhoven forward Memphis Depay on Tuesday. Luuk de Jong scored a first-half hat-trick for the defending Eredivise champions. Dinamo Zagreb suggested Arsenal may not have it all their own way in Croatia on Wednesday when they thrashed their city rivals Lokomotiva Zagreb 4-0. Dinamo\u2019s Argentinian defender Leonardo Sigali scored then sounded a warning to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side. \u201cWe are playing so well,\u201d said Sigali. \u201cIf we play against Arsenal like we did against Lokomotiva, who knows what can happen.\u201d Maccabi Tel Aviv, who travel to Chelsea, dropped their first points of the season when they drew 1-1 at Ironi Kiryat Shmon. A mistake by the Maccabi goalkeeper, Predrag Rajkovic, was punished in the 20th minute but Gal Alberman equalised off the bench. The Champions League holders, Barcelona, warmed up for their defence with a 2-1 win against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Saturday evening. Lionel Messi came off the bench to inspire the victory at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium. The Argentinian had been left out of the starting lineup after missing a day of training this week for the birth of his second child but his introduction on the hour made an immediate impression. Barcelona had fallen behind to a Fernando Torres\u2019 goal early in the second half but Neymar\u2019s free-kick levelled the score before Messi sealed victory 13 minutes from time with a first-time finish following Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s assist. Barcelona travel to Roma on Wednesday, while Atl\u00e9tico take on Galatasaray. Earlier Cristiano Ronaldo secured his place in the history books when he became Real Madrid\u2019s record scorer in La Liga after netting five times in a 6-0 win at Espanyol. Ronaldo has scored a remarkable 230 goals in only 203 appearances for Real since moving from Manchester United in 2009 for \u00a380m, two more than the club\u2019s former striker Ra\u00fal, who needed 550 games to amass 228 goals. The 30-year-old is up to fourth on the list of all-time top scorers in La Liga behind Hugo S\u00e1nchez (Real, 234 goals), Telmo Zarra (Athletic Bilbao, 253) and Messi (Barcelona, 285). \u201cThe numbers speak for themselves,\u201d the Real manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, said. \u201cSomeone who scores so many goals definitely has a place in the history books. I hope that he can continue to add to his goalscoring account for his own benefit and that of the team.\u201d Ronaldo had not scored in Real\u2019s first two La Liga games of the season but his spectacular return to form bodes well for the club\u2019s Champions League Group A match against Shakhtar Donetsk at the Bernab\u00e9u tomorrow. \u201cYou have to really put an emphasis on the five goals and the fact that he could have scored more,\u201d added Ben\u00edtez. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich needed a late penalty to beat Augsburg 2-1 and maintain their perfect start in the Bundesliga. Pep Guardiola\u2019s team are in the same Champions League group as Arsenal and face Olympiakos on Wednesday. Elsewhere in Germany Bayer Leverkusen, who face BATE Borisov in Group E\u2019s other fixture on Wednesday, suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat to promoted Darmstadt 98, while Wolfsburg, who are in Group B with Manchester United and face CSKA Moscow tomorrow, fared marginally better with a goalless draw at promoted Ingolstadt to stay in third place on eight points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
