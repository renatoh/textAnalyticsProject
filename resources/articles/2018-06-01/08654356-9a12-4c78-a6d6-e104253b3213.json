At the French Grand Prix Sebastian Vettel was once again found wanting and Lewis Hamilton, in the manner England had shown in Russia before the race, was able to step up and clinically take advantage with a dominant display. He took the win and the lead of the world championship once again. If he is to secure his fifth title this season, these are the moments that will make the difference. After a poor weekend at the last round in Canada, where he saw his 14-point lead in the championship turned into a one-point deficit, Hamilton had still warned that he expected Ferrari would falter at some point. He might not have been expecting it to happen so soon, however, and Vettel\u2019s error means he again holds a 14-point lead over the German. There was a celebratory air at Circuit Paul Ricard as the race welcomed France back to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year hiatus and the grandstands were flooded with tricolours and the stirring sound of La Marseillaise. But for Vettel, any optimism would have turned to regret barely moments after the final bars of the mighty anthem had died away. Starting from third behind Valtteri Bottas he had been quick off the line on the faster ultrasoft tyres but was too hot into turn one, locked up and found himself with nowhere to go, clipping the rear of the Finn. Vettel had to pit for a new front wing and Bottas for a puncture. They emerged at the back of the field while Hamilton, clear of the carnage, took to the clean air and controlled the race from start to finish. He took the flag in front of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen. Vettel was given a five-second penalty for causing a collision but drove an impressive comeback, scything though the field to take fifth, as much as he might have expected. But Bottas could manage only seventh after taking damage to the floor of his car from the puncture. Hamilton was pleased with his performance but critical that Vettel had not received a harsher penalty. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all go into turn one as hard as we could but when someone destroys your race through an error and it\u2019s only a tap on the wrist and you are still able to come back and finish ahead of the person you took out, it doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d He was joined in the criticism by the Mercedes non-executive chairman, Niki Lauda. \u201cWhy Vettel gets only five seconds for this enormous mistake, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said the driver who won here for Ferrari in 1975. \u201cIt is too little. Five seconds is nothing, he destroyed the whole race for himself and for Bottas.\u201d Vettel considered the punishment appropriate but he was left to consider another moment that proved costly. Last season his barge on Hamilton in Baku was ill-judged and his poor decision at the start in Singapore was the beginning of the end of his title fight. He was too hot on the restart in Baku this season and he lost places. He has the charging instincts of a racer but in this fight with Hamilton he simply cannot afford repeatedly to drop points. The German admitted he had been at fault. \u201cMy start was too good and I ended up with nowhere to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my mistake, I tried to brake and get out of it but I couldn\u2019t. I had nowhere to go, with little grip I unfortunately made contact with Valtteri.\u201d Mercedes had fitted their new engine here and will be buoyed by the clear evidence that it has matched and potentially bettered the step forward that Ferrari made with their new unit, although Vettel remained optimistic his team could have equalled them. \u201cI think we had good pace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to say if we could have challenged but I think we had the pace to at least go with Mercedes.\u201d His error means waiting until Austria and Silverstone to find out but here Hamilton had climbed into the cockpit, heartened from England\u2019s demolition of Panama, and proceeded to deliver his own masterclass in applying relentless pressure to an opponent under the cosh. Doubtless he hopes he can continue riding the same wave as Gareth Southgate\u2019s men. \u201c6-1, that\u2019s a mighty score,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a great result for England today, if they are playing like that they need to keep opening a can of whoop-ass on everyone. That could be awesome, I don\u2019t know how England would take it if we did win the World Cup. It\u2019s been such a long time.\u201d Red Bull\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo was in fourth, Kevin Magnussen in the Haas was sixth; the Renaults of Carlos Sainz and Nico H\u00fclkenberg in eighth and ninth and Sauber\u2019s Charles Leclerc once again drove superbly to take 10th."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
