Simon, who has represented the Matildas at two previous World Cups, has only recently returned to action for her American side, Houston Dash, following ankle surgery in December. Game time for the 81-cap forward has been severely limited this year, and concerns over her match fitness have opened the door to Fowler, the 16-year-old Cairns-born attacker who has been at the centre of a tug of war with the Irish FA over her eligibility. \u201cIt was a thorough process,\u201d Milicic told Fox Sports. \u201cWe\u2019re confident in the monitoring system we had in place. We tried to stick with criteria of form and fitness.\u201d Simon\u2019s consolation prize is a call-up to the Matildas\u2019 pre-tournament camp in Turkey as a standby player, along with 17-year-old Melbourne Victory striker Kyra Cooney-Cross, and Milicic did not rule out the possibility of either making it to France. \u201cThe 23 are selected but we\u2019ve seen in football anything can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to cover ourselves so that if anything goes wrong the standby players are ready to go. Kyah hasn\u2019t got back into the form and fitness she would like but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to be richer for the experience.\u201d A cloud was also hanging over Sydney FC\u2019s Chloe Logarzo, who is yet to feature for the Matildas during Milicic\u2019s tenure after picking up an ankle injury in the W-League grand final. But having proved her fitness in recent games for Washington Spirit in the NWSL, the key midfielder has been called up. Logarzo\u2019s teammate in the US, Amy Harrison, also gets the nod but there is no place for Alex Chidiac in the group, which will be led by captain Sam Kerr and her vice-captain Steph Catley. Milicic\u2019s 23 boasts of healthy blend of youth and experience \u2013 eight players will be getting their first taste of a World Cup, while the likes of Lisa De Vanna, Clare Polkinghorne, and Lydia Williams will be appearing at their fourth. Kerr, Laura Alleway, Caitlin Foord, Elise Kellond-Knight, Emily van Egmond, and Tameka Yallop (nee Butt) will be appearing at their third and, in total, the squad has 1,300 international caps to its name. \u201cThis is a special group of Australian footballers because, as a unit, they have accumulated a wealth of international experience despite the average age of the team being quite young,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cHaving players that have appeared at multiple Fifa Women\u2019s World Cups in our squad will help to guide the eight players traveling to their first Women\u2019s World Cup, and I believe we will have genuine competition for starting positions across all areas of the pitch.\u201d Milicic was in Sydney to make the announcement and will now head back to Europe to finalise preparations for the tournament at a training camp in Antalya. From there, the Matildas will travel to the Netherlands to play a friendly in Eindhoven on 1 June before getting their World Cup campaign under way against Italy in Valenciennes on 9 June. Australia squad: Lydia Williams, Mackenzie Arnold, Teagan Micah; Teigen Allen, Laura Alleway, Gema Simon, Ellie Carpenter, Steph Catley, Alanna Kennedy, Clare Polkinghorne: Elise Kellond-Knight, Emily Van Egmond, Tameka Yallop, Aivi Luik, Chloe Logarzo, Katrina Gorry, Amy Harrison: Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna, Caitlin Foord, Emily Gielnik, Hayley Raso, Mary Fowler.
