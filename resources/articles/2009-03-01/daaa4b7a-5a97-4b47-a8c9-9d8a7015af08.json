With Emile Heskey and Frank Lampard scoring early and late to complete a satisfactory evening against fairly undemanding opposition, the only worry for Fabio Capello ahead of Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine appears to be the number of strikers who beat Rooney to the bath. Heskey, Carlton Cole and Peter Crouch only lasted a matter of minutes before pulling up injured, and by the time Rooney was announced man of the match it was mainly due to a dearth of alternatives. Only Lampard ran him close, but then of England's attacking players, only Lampard had also lasted 90 minutes. \"We should have scored more goals in the first half when we had the chance,\" Rooney said. \"It was sad to lose so many players but I'll have no problem playing up front on my own against Ukraine.\" It might not come to that. Capello confirmed that Crouch had only suffered a knock and would be available on Wednesday, and while Cole's groin strain will rule him out Heskey will have a scan today to ascertain the extent of his thigh problem and still has a chance. Nevertheless Capello admitted he was glad still to have Rooney. \"He's important to us, and he can play in any position,\" the Italian said. \"He's our joker. Like the card. He's our crazy joker.\" Rio Ferdinand should also be available on Wednesday after pulling out on the morning of the game to protect a slight groin strain. Matthew Upson deputised at centre-half, though apart from the suspense engendered by England keeping their tracksuits on until the last moment before revealing their new retro kit, most interest surrounded the arrangement of the front half of the team. While Slovakia favoured the 4-2-3-1 formation, England began with a more conventional 4-4-2, with Steven Gerrard roaming fairly free but taking care to anchor himself to the left touchline and dropping back deeper than he does for Liverpool. Gerrard is in such a run of form at the moment he could probably play in central defence and influence games, though pleasingly he turned up on the left to engineer England's opening goal. He was well found by Rooney after making one of those sprints into the box he does so effectively for his club, and after an elegant controlling touch and turn his low cross was tucked in off a post by Heskey, who just got a foot in front of the defender Martin Skrtel. Heskey climbed a couple of feet higher than Skrtel two minutes later, and should have scored from Rooney's cross, yet headed over the bar. \"Until the first goal we weren't that bad,\" Slovakia's coach Vladimir Weiss claimed. \"The goals after that we allowed England to score.\" Heskey only lasted five more minutes before succumbing to muscle cramp and giving Capello the perfect opportunity to promote Gerrard to secondary striker if he so wished. He did not. He kept to the same shape and sent on Carlton Cole as Heskey's replacement. Gerrard started to wander a bit after that, though returned to the left to backheel neatly an opening for Aaron Lennon on the half hour only for the Spurs player to demonstrate why he normally plays on the right. England passed up a good opportunity when Gerrard crashed through Skrtel's attempted tackle and rather than go for goal himself tried to set up Carlton Cole. Not only could Cole not accept the opportunity he collapsed in an undignified heap after overstretching himself. Capello sent on Peter Crouch, proving beyond all reasonable doubt that Gerrard is going to have to do his split-striking for Liverpool for the time being. He should not be too disappointed in his present inspired form. His clever assist gave Rooney a chance to extend the lead on the stroke of half-time, only for the Manchester United player to shoot over. England could have done with the added security, for Slovakia closed the first half with a goalbound effort from Robert Vittek that James tipped over his bar. David Beckham was introduced at the interval, presumably as a precaution in case any more collapsing strikers ruined his plans to overtake Bobby Moore's caps record. At least this was not a cameo appearance of the insultingly short variety, and as Beckham did not exactly suffer by comparison with Lennon he could even get a start next time. One almost hopes so, since 100 starts in 110 appearances would surely silence the naysayers and lay a tiresome argument to rest. Ben Foster and Stewart Downing came on for the second half as well, with James, Lennon and Gerrard making way. Erik Jendrisek, one of the Slovakian substitutes, fired into the side netting on 56 minutes after John Terry's missed tackle on Filip Holosko left Foster briefly exposed. Attempting to make amends in attack five minutes later, Terry possibly deprived Crouch of a goal by helping his header over the line from an offside position. Then the captain shot narrowly wide after Rooney had been unable to turn Beckham's unselfish pass across goal over the line. Patiently returning to duties on the right Beckham collected a Gareth Barry cross that had overshot its intended target, and clipped in a much more inviting one to present Rooney with an unmissable header. All that remained was for Crouch to follow the new trend by taking a knock and coming off, and Lampard to burst on to Michael Carrick's pass to score the third before setting up Rooney, perhaps slightly offside, for a crisply finished second goal. England, or most of them, should be ready for the real thing on Wednesday. \"I'm very happy,\" Capello said. \"I hope we will be better against Ukraine.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
