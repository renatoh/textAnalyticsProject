On the ground it's a traffic roundabout and on its outer edges is the most expensive retail space in Israel. Here is Donna Karan, Versace, Emporio Armani, and there, in the centre, until it was cleared by the authorities two months ago, was Bread Square, a township of tents of the Jewish homeless: not just the poor and the down-and-out, but those who until recently owned an apartment, had a business, took holidays abroad. During the summer, all Israel had been galvanised by Vicki Knafo, a single mother who walked from her home in the Negev desert with an Israeli flag round her shoulders to sit outside the office of the finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to oppose his Thatcherite budget proposals which would force single parents into work. Vicky failed. She's now back home, working in a candle factory (though she left the country for the first time last week, to attend the signing of the Geneva accords) but her journey remains inside an Israeli consciousness hammered by recession. Here at a table at Goodies, the Kikar's most fashionable caf\u00e9, Ayelet, a 34-year-old ex-advertising executive, explains the evolution of her clothing from the long skirts of the religiously orthodox woman to the DKNY suede jacket, Chanel sunglasses and gold necklace she is wearing now. She left her job in advertising two years ago, to make a tikkun olam - the repair of the world, or, in her case, Israeli society. \"Israelis are very influenced by America,\" she says. \"People here wanted to be Americans, every woman wanted to look like someone from Sex and the City. People made obscene amounts of money in the hi-tech boom, we were a society that thought only of consumerism and we were eating ourselves from the inside. Two years ago I said enough. I felt nauseous with all the shopping. We had been living in a world in which one Prada shirt would have supported a family for a month. Then came the austerity budget of Netanyahu.\" The cuts have provoked threats of a general strike and the revival of class politics in Israel. On Sunday, while the Israel Business Conference ate sushi and smoked salmon at the Intercontinental Hotel in Tel Aviv, across the street the Conference of the Exploited heard speeches from groups such as Forum for the War on Unemployment, Voice of the Neighbourhoods and Angry Grandmothers, demanding to know what was being done to protect their interests. \"All the time I worked in advertising, I felt that something was missing in my soul,\" says Ayelet. \"I believe that we can't be Americans, we live in too complicated a situation to behave as if everything is normal, because nothing is normal. After Rabin was killed we realised we had been living in a bubble. Everybody said we should do something because if you belong to a class that can contribute to society you do it - at least that's how my friends interpret Rabin's last testimony.\" Ayelet did a one-year MA in crisis mediation. She now teaches a class in mediation to primary school children, in an attempt to defuse the violence that filters down from the occupation. They choose eight-year-olds who are class leaders in the hope that they will influence others for when they serve in the army. \"I don't like that the sons of our society have to deal with pregnant women at checkpoints,\" she says. \"If my country treats Palestinians like that, how does it impact on how it treats the poor at home? If you treat others as lesser, where do you draw the line? I hear two voices in Israel. One says, 'The situation sucks, I just want to take care of myself and my kids. As for anyone else, tough luck, we tried peace with the Palestinians and it failed.' The other voice says, 'Now is not the time to give up, we must hold hands together because if we don't, we'll fall apart.' Whatever problems we have, whether it's the Palestinians, the economy or al-Qaida, we must put our moral values first. \"This is an extremely divided society, and the future of Israel is in our ability to respect the differences inside it: those differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardi, religious and secular, Arab and Jew, left and right, are what make us beautiful. I really believe that the occupation hangs above us like a cloud; you can't ignore it. Everything has become more extreme and with it comes the feeling that we are not good people, which is very hard for us. But the question is, because we did wrong, should we not exist as a country? I have to find out how to be a new good person because after the occupation is over, I don't want to wake up and find my society is in ruins because we've invested all our energy in the conflict.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
