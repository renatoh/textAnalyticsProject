The new outfit - 51 percent owned by Namco, the rest by Sony - has been formed to fully exploit the cell processor and will work on games as well as other audio visual entertainment applications. PC and mobile phone games will also fall under its remit. Sony and Namco have been working closely together since the early Nineties and now they've had a child. It's sort of cute.
