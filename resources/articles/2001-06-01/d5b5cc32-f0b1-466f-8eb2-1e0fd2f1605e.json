The proposal required a \"yes\" vote by 75% of members, which was easily achieved with more than 97% of members in favour of the move. \"We are pleased that not only have our members voted in favour of the proposal to demutualise and transfer the business to Abbey National group, but that over 215,000 members have chosen to cast a vote in favour,\" said David Woods, group managing director of Scottish Provident. The transfer to Abbey National is expected to take place on July 31, following a second extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on June 29 to confirm today's result. Members who have not already voted will be able to do so at this second meeting. 325,000 Scottish Provident members holding with-profits policies will be eligible for the typical \u00a34,000 payout. A further 125,000 policyholders who have non-profits plans, such as unit-linked investments into both pension and endowment plans, are members but will not lose financially. Investors in these funds will receive a flat \u00a3500 irrespective of the size of their holding. This is identical to the payout offered by Scottish Widows to their unit-linked and non-profit customers. The decision by Scottish Provident members to demutualise follows similar judgements by members of insurers Friends Provident and Scottish Life in the last few weeks, sparking off summer windfall bonuses for many customers.
