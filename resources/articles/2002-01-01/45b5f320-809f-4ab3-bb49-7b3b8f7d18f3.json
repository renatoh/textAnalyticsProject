Or, it might now be added, let her marry a Leeds United footballer. Not that any slur is intended on those members of David O'Leary's team who are ideal husbands. It is just that the present vibes emanating from Elland Road are of the troglodyte kind. The Professional Footballers' Association has suggested that clubs suspend players who are consistently in trouble with referees without waiting for the Football Association to do it. The visit of Arsenal to Leeds tomorrow could well strengthen the PFA's argument. This fixture continues to be as combustible as meetings of Montagues and Capulets. When Arsenal played Leeds at Highbury last August nine players were cautioned and Leeds had Lee Bowyer and Danny Mills sent off. Last season the teams' two Premiership encounters produced 15 bookings and 88 free-kicks. In addition Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was fined \u00a310,000 and given a one-match ban by the FA for planting a set of studs under Olivier Dacourt's chin during the game at Elland Road. Arsenal's disciplinary record under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger remains abysmal with an average of around seven dismissals a season during his period in charge. Already there have been six this time around. Leeds, however, currently occupy the pillory. The longer their list of cautions and sendings-off grows, the more hellbent some members of their team appear to be on adding to it. O'Leary has just lost Alan Smith for five games, the striker's appeal against the red card he received in the third-round FA Cup tie in Cardiff a fortnight ago for elbowing an opponent having been turned down by a disciplinary tribunal whose deliberations lasted all of 10 minutes. Mills, sent off at Newcastle last Saturday for kicking Craig Bellamy, will shortly begin a four-match suspension and Bowyer, who has two disrepute cases pending, is facing six games' enforced absence. Bowyer is accused of elbowing Liverpool's Gary McAllister in an FA Cup fourth-round tie a year ago and using foul and abusive language to the referee, Jeff Winter (the fourth official tomorrow) following his dismissal at Highbury in August. These hearings were delayed until after the court case in which Bowyer was cleared of assault and affray. Given the imminent loss of such important players at a time when his team is short of another half-dozen regulars through injury, and with games against Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool in the offing, O'Leary is unlikely to warm to the thought of banning people off his own bat at the recommendation of the PFA. Nevertheless, it is clear that, unless the Leeds manager can better control what the players do on the field, not only will his team blow their hopes of winning the Premiership, they will also scupper their chance of competing in next season's Champions League. This would be a pity because until recently the challenge from Elland Road was adding a refreshing and positive dimension to the seasonal conundrum of which team were most likely to deny Manchester United the title. And there are still a lot of good things about Leeds, particularly when Rio Ferdinand, Harry Kewell and Dacourt are fit. In the main the present anarchic situation concerns three players - Smith, Bowyer and Mills - who between them have collected five red cards this season. There is, however, a danger of the team as a whole becoming infected. Neale Barry, who refereed the bad-tempered 1-1 draw between Leeds and Aston Villa in November, later spoke of Smith \"hissing and snarling\" when being sent off for planting an elbow in Alpay Ozalan's chest. \"It is very difficult when you are faced with a team with this type of approach,\" Barry said, adding that \"it was the most evil game in five years I have done in the Premiership\". Graham Barber, who in addition to his dismissal of Mills at St James' Park last Saturday cautioned six Leeds players, may well have travelled back to Tring with similar feelings. Had he had a clear view of Mills catching Laurent Robert in the mouth with a forearm the defender would have gone before the game was 10 minutes old. Afterwards O'Leary pleaded that his team were just being competitive, an old managerial saw that should have been retired along with tackles from behind. An important part of being competitive surely involves keeping a full complement of players on the pitch, a point to which O'Leary and Wenger should both have addressed themselves more urgently before now. Whatever happens at Elland Road tomorrow, attention will continue to be focused on the behaviour of the two sides, not to mention the response of the referee Mark Halsey to any problems that arise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
