In the end, the Barnet manager\u2019s team, the lowest-ranked left in the competition, succumbed to the quality of Sa\u00efd Benrahma as the playmaker helped Brentford book a trip to Swansea for the fifth round with assists for the opening two goals in the first half. But having seen his players progress all the way from beating their fellow National League side Braintree Town in the fourth qualifying round back in October to beating Sheffield United in round three, Currie could still afford to smile at the final whistle after a spirited performance from his team that could easily have yielded another shock. \u201cThey\u2019re disappointed but when we look at it in a few days they will realise what they have achieved,\u201d said the former midfielder. \u201cIf we had got our goal at 2-0 it could have been a different story. But I\u2019m immensely proud of how they performed.\u201d After a brilliant free kick from Dan Sparkes had forced a replay in front of a record crowd at the Hive two weekends ago, Barnet were attempting to go further in this competition than they have ever been against a side who are more than 70 places above them in the league pyramid. In protest against Brentford\u2019s decision to only allow 1,600 visiting supporters \u2013 300 fewer than the maximum permitted \u2013 Kleanthous watched the game in the club bar nine miles away because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting with the prawn sandwich brigade\u201d when so many fans had missed out on such an important occasion. With swathes of red seats in the main stand remaining unoccupied as the match kicked off, it seemed a shame a compromise couldn\u2019t have been reached by two sides who also share a nickname. Yet the group of supporters stationed behind Barnet\u2019s goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, for the first half more than made up for it in terms of atmosphere. Even the opening goal after seven minutes from Sergi Can\u00f3s didn\u2019t seem to dampen their enthusiasm, with the Spaniard confidently tucking home Benrahma\u2019s cutback following an innovative corner routine for his third goal in as many matches. Brentford have been revitalised in recent weeks under the head coach Thomas Franks, having not lost in 10 matches since mid-December \u2013 a run that has lifted them well away from the bottom three in the Championship. A talented side packed with players who are comfortable on the ball, they will move to a new 17,250-capacity stadium up the road at the end of next season and could be real contenders to reach the top flight for the first time since before the second world war if they continue their upward trajectory. The only issue for their chairman Matthew Benham will be retaining his best players, with Chris Mepham having become the latest to leave last month for Bournemouth. Neal Maupay \u2013 the former France Under-21 who ended up in west London after a spell at Saint-Etienne \u2013 could be the next to fly the nest, while Algeria international Benrahma, a fellow graduate from Nice\u2019s academy, also looks good enough to play at a higher level. His pinpoint delivery from a free-kick allowed Julian Jeanvier to volley home the second and it suddenly felt a long way back for Currie\u2019s team. But if Brentford thought their opponents would simply roll over in the second half, they were mistaken. Within two minutes of the restart, a near 22-man brawl ensued that threatened to spill into the stands after Barnet\u2019s Medy Elito slid in recklessly on Can\u00f3s before falling to the ground when his opponent squared up to him. Both escaped with bookings but the bad feeling lingered throughout the second half. Sparkes came off the bench to curl a free kick just over from almost the same position as his equaliser in the first match before Craig Robson\u2019s header struck the woodwork from a free-kick. Another flowing move eventually saw Maupay score his 20th goal of the season to put the tie beyond Barnet before David Tutonda\u2019s consolation ensured their supporters could make the short journey home with their heads held high. \u201cIt\u2019s 30 years since we have been in a quarter-final so it would be nice to do that again,\u201d said Franks. Playing like this, Brentford will be a match for anyone. QPR ease past Pompey Second-half goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith proved the difference as QPR made it through to the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 22 years with a 2-0 win at the expense of Portsmouth at Loftus Road. In a quiet first period, Darnell Furlong\u2019s header against the bar from Luke Freeman\u2019s centre was the pick of the chances. Extra time looked a distinct possibility heading into the break, but Wells, QPR\u2019s top-scorer, broke the deadlock with 20 minutes left, capitalising on chaos at a corner to bundle in from a yard out. The result was then made safe seven minutes later as the talismanic Freeman delivered a sumptuous free-kick which Smith powered home to set up a home tie against Watford on 15 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
