He was right then and he is right now. Britain may have fallen behind the rest of the world in many things, but it continues to excel every other country in the quality of its maps. The Ordnance Survey may no longer publish its classic inch to the mile maps \u2013 inked out by hand \u2013 but the extraordinary 1:2,500 series continues to detail almost every wall and hedge, lane, railway bridge, house and telephone box in the country. To a walker lost in the hills in the fog, they remain more useful than any satellite navigation system. Now the Ordnance Survey has acquired its own biography in the form of a new book, Map of a Nation, by Rachel Hewitt, which describes the early, heroic years of British mapping, when military surveyors ventured out with nothing more than a theodolite, a chain and a couple of poles. In 1808, the book records, two men from the Ordnance Survey ventured from the village of Bootle on to a nearby fell, Black Combe: the start of a survey that resulted in the maps so praised by Wainwright and relied upon by walkers today. This winter, in the fog and snow of the hilltops, OS maps will show the way \u2013 one reason to be grateful that the institution will survive intact in today's spending review."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
