Last month, the Good Omens and American Gods author, who is also an ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), asked his Twitter followers to tell him what reminded them of warmth. After receiving almost 1,000 responses \u2013 with Ben Stiller and Monica Lewinsky among those to contribute \u2013 Gaiman found himself with a 25,000-word document, from which he has composed his newest written work: a freeform poem to launch UNHCR\u2019s Winter Emergency Appeal for refugees across the Middle East. What You Need to Be Warm touches on everything from \u201ca baked potato of a winter\u2019s night to wrap your hands around or burn your mouth\u201d to \u201cthe tink tink tink of iron radiators waking in an old house\u201d. \u201cIt was very intimidating. The original brief was, \u2018Can you do a story with a plot?\u2019, and what I\u2019d figured was, we\u2019d get 100 or so replies, I\u2019d pick one that would somehow call to me, and write a short short story. What I wrote was much more of a reaction to sitting and reading 25,000 words of tweets, one after the other,\u201d said Gaiman. He described the writing process as \u201clike trying to do the world\u2019s most complicated crossword \u2026 It was ridiculously hard to write and especially hard when you know one of the engines of \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 public poetry, is that it\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnytime you ever see something produced by a poet laureate about any royal event you think \u2018Oh no, no\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s that feeling that you\u2019re doomed, but let\u2019s go down as honestly and meaningfully as you can.\u201d Other suggestions ranged from \u201cthe sound of a cat\u2019s purr\u201d to \u201cGrandma\u2019s kitchen in foggy St Petersburg\u201d; \u201cpots of steaming tea so strong the spoon stands up\u201d to \u201cthe smell of wet wool over classroom radiators\u201d. \u201cWhat is so beautiful about this is the ways people are describing cold in contrast to warmth. It\u2019s \u2018coming in from\u2019, it\u2019s what it\u2019s a contrast to,\u201d said the author. \u201cThe biggest problem that the Syrian refugees have right now as winter is starting to hit is you don\u2019t get that change of state. And that means two things: you don\u2019t have a change of state from cold to warm, and you don\u2019t have a state. That\u2019s what it all coalesced around. It was much more of a freeform poem than I\u2019d thought.\u201d Gaiman\u2019s poem will be knitted into a three-metre UK Solidarity Scarf, by digital knitting machine company Kniterate. It will also feature traditional Syrian floral designs created by women in Azraq refugee camp, Jordan, which will be supported by the appeal. \u201cWe\u2019re in a place right now where public appeals mean something. We have more refugees and displaced people now than since the end of the second world war, and there are funding issues. The hardest part is that it doesn\u2019t get better. They need blankets, warm clothing, thermal linings,\u201d said Gaiman. \u201cTrying to make art in order to get attention for something like this is a very good use of my time.\u201d \u2022 Donations to the UNHCR Winter Emergency Appeal can be made at www.unhcr.org/belowzero or by calling freephone 0800 029 3383. What You Need to be Warm by Neil Gaiman A baked potato of a winter\u2019s night to wrap your hands around or burn your mouth. A blanket knitted by your mother\u2019s cunning fingers. Or your grandmother\u2019s. A smile, a touch, trust, as you walk in from the snow or return to it, the tips of your ears pricked pink and frozen. The tink tink tink of iron radiators waking in an old house. To surface from dreams in a bed, burrowed beneath blankets and comforters, the change of state from cold to warm is all that matters, and you think just one more minute snuggled here before you face the chill. Just one. Places we slept as children: they warm us in the memory. We travel to an inside from the outside. To the orange flames of the fireplace or the wood burning in the stove. Breath-ice on the inside of windows, to be scratched off with a fingernail, melted with a whole hand. Frost on the ground that stays in the shadows, waiting for us. Wear a scarf. Wear a coat. Wear a sweater. Wear socks. Wear thick gloves. An infant as she sleeps between us. A tumble of dogs, a kindle of cats and kittens. Come inside. You\u2019re safe now. A kettle boiling at the stove. Your family or friends are there. They smile. Cocoa or chocolate, tea or coffee, soup or toddy, what you know you need. A heat exchange, they give it to you, you take the mug and start to thaw. While outside, for some of us, the journey began as we walked away from our grandparents\u2019 houses away from the places we knew as children: changes of state and state and state, to stumble across a stony desert, or to brave the deep waters, while food and friends, home, a bed, even a blanket become just memories. Sometimes it only takes a stranger, in a dark place, to hold out a badly knitted scarf, to offer a kind word, to say we have the right to be here, to make us warm in the coldest season. You have the right to be here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
