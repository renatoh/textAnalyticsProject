But here, as a speculative shot flew 35 yards through Radek Cerny's poorly positioned arms, Juande Ramos may have realised the folly of that policy - and paid cutting Robinson's legs from under him the previous Wednesday. If Robinson has suffered his share of calamities this season it is hard to imagine him conceding that goal. Culled by England ahead of the loss to Croatia, Robinson has now been told that he is surplus to Tottenham requirements. Surplus, perhaps, but the club had best find a sounder replacement fast. Not that Ramos would publicly admit as much. 'Goals are conceded by the team as a whole and it's not a question of doling out responsibility to one player or another,' he said. 'We've conceded two goals and lost the game. It's just a bad result. We are working with a squad of happy players at the moment. We were in a very complicated position in the league table but we are very happy with the players we've got.\" Is Robinson happy with his lot? A broad grin spread across Ramos' face. 'That's a question he would have to answer.' Cerny's failure to deal with Juliano Belletti's long-distance punt set the tone of this match. Tight and evenly balanced until that point, Tottenham were a goal down and chasing a team that rarely cedes an advantage. When Shaun Wright-Phillips embellished Chelsea's lead late in the second half, the visitors were back to a familiar scenario - a poor performance following an impressive one. At Ashburton Grove on Wednesday, Ramos wore a small smile, a sign of satisfaction at the tactical triumph that almost earned a rare victory. If the Spaniard's first months at Tottenham have not provided quite the radical transformation he's been credited with, his authority has been steadily underlined. Of all the boardroom machinations that undermined his predecessor Martin Jol, the relationship with the sporting director Damien Comolli was especially damaging. Jol was repeatedly denied signings, Comolli instead providing new recruits who proved over-priced and ill-judged. With Comolli's future at the club tied to his own, Ramos should not suffer the same fate. Chairman Daniel Levy has been informed that Ramos would exchange all but a handful of the squad. In an impromptu training-ground meeting, Jermain Defoe was told to toe the disciplinary line or find another club. By Wednesday evening, Ramos was dropping Robinson without a word of warning. At least the goalkeeper deigned to warm up yesterday. As Avram Grant continued his policy of partial rotation, he took no account of Ashley Cole's perennial problems with Aaron Lennon. The winger underlined them early, shimmying past a prostrate left-back to draw a corner. He delivered Spurs' best chances, placing a cross on Dimitar Berbatov's head and a second on to Steed Malbranque's boot, whose volley was well met by Petr Cech. By then Tottenham were chasing the game. As Belletti wandered forward from the halfway line, there should have been nothing on but a pass. Instead the Brazilian aimed for goal and from a distance and height that should have been parried his shot swerved slightly and comfortably through Cerny's hands. 'You're worse than Robinson,' taunted the Chelsea fans. Tottenham started treading water, lacking the energy or insight that characterised their play against Arsenal until Adel Taarabt took over on the left wing, spreading crosses and passes around. Lennon drew a free-kick that Berbatov lifted fractionally over. An unusually irate Grant introduced Nicolas Anelka and claimed almost instant reward when Wright-Phillips played the \u00a315million striker into position for a finely executed spin and left-foot shot that Cerny touched away. 'He played without training even once but got used very quickly to the style of the team,' said Grant. 'You cannot ask more from the first performance.' The game grew more ill-tempered and yellow cards were shown with regularity until Wright-Phillips settled it. Joe Cole was provider, collecting a throw-in, gliding through tacklers and squaring for a shot that travelled low through Ledley King's legs and into the net. Anelka all but added a third, crashing a shot off underside of bar, but the game was up. Next time these sides meet Tottenham might consider employing a goalkeeper they trust. THE FANS' VERDICT James Aidan, Observer reader It was a lovely performance, but the game swung on our being able to control their strikers, and them not controlling ours. Keane and Berbatov didn't get much supply, though when Berbatov did get anything Alex had him in his pocket. Wright-Phillips was man of the match and is finally being played in his proper position as an inside forward, not on the wing. Belletti's goal was a Brazilian wonder-shot, with a massive swerve on it, and I don't think any keeper would have saved it. Anelka's arrival brings a subtlety to the forward line. Spurs worked very hard - O'Hara looked very good - and in the first 20 minutes of the second half they were all over us and could have equalised from a set piece. But once we scored the second it was over. Player ratings Cech 8; Belletti 9, Alex 8, Carvalho 8, A Cole 7; Makelele 7; Wright-Phillips 9, (Sidwell N/A), Ballack 8; J Cole 7, Pizarro 7 (Anelka 8), Malouda 5 (Bridge 6) Dave Mason, Observer reader I was confident going into the game, based on Wednesday, but we didn't have the quality to break them down. In midfield we missed Jenas and it showed how stupid two-ton Tommy was getting sent off last week. We needed more effort from everybody - Keane, Berbatov and Lennon showed none at all. Cerny had to come in, but the first goal was eminently stoppable and for the second Lee showed their player the inside. Basic, basic poor defending. We pressed in the second half and had a couple of threatening corners, but Cech was great. Player ratings Cerny 6; Chimbonda 6, Dawson 6, King 7, Lee 5; Lennon 5, Boateng 5 (Kaboul 5), O'Hara 6 (Defoe 5), Malbranque 6 (Taarabt 5); Keane 4, Berbatov 6"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
