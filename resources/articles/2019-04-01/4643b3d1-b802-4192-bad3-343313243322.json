Speaking at a candidates\u2019 forum hosted by the local environment group Lighter Footprints at Hawthorn Arts Centre on Thursday night, Frydenberg said the project still had to pass nine more approvals after the environment minister, Melissa Price, granted the latest approval on Tuesday, of which he said the \u201cmost fundamental\u201d were with the Queensland government. \u201cIn this case on the water issue, we took the advice of the CSIRO, of Geosciences Australia, and that is why it has gone to the next stage,\u201d he said. Labor has indicated it may push for a review of the approval decision because the timing of the election announcement meant a planned estimates hearing where the CSIRO would explain the extent of its advice did not go ahead. The Adani coalmine is expected to cause difficulties for Frydenberg in Kooyong. Of the six candidates at the forum \u2013 also there were Labor\u2019s Jana Stewart, the Greens\u2019 Julian Burnside and the independents Oliver Yates, Bill Chandler and Angelina Zubac \u2013 he was the only one who did not criticise the project. About a quarter of the 260 questions submitted by the audience in the packed venue were about Adani. Yates, a former Liberal party member and chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, said the project had lost all social licence. \u201cFor a government that represents its people and for a member who represents this audience to be continuing to support a project that its electors in this area do not support is an extraordinary position for a local member to take,\u201d he said. Burnside said suggestions that voters in Kooyong would vote solely on economic rather than environmental issues was \u201ca mark of the contempt with which the Liberal party see this electorate\u201d. \u201cThey can\u2019t even imagine the possibility that this electorate would turf them out.\u201d He dismissed concerns of sovereign risk over the Adani project as \u201ca meaningless expression as a matter of law\u201d. \u201cI would say if there\u2019s a contract which Adani could enforce I would hold to account those members of the outgoing Liberal government who signed the contract,\u201d he said. Yates, Burnside and Chandler had the strongest support from the crowd. Stewart said she \u201cpersonally [didn\u2019t] agree with Adani\u201d but that Labor would take a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d, prompting Chandler to hop to his feet and step from side to side, saying: \u201cThis is Labor jumping from one foot to another on Adani, they keep moving on it all the time.\u201d At a separate climate change forum in Mildura, the Nationals candidate for the western Victorian seat of Mallee, Anne Webster, engaged in some heavy product differentiation from her Queensland party colleagues. \u201cThe only people I\u2019m beholden to are the voters of the Mallee electorate,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of you possibly thought I would come tonight and talk about climate change not being real \u2026 I want to assure you that I make up my own mind, have my own opinions and I\u2019m not afraid to stand up to others.\u201d While four independent candidates at the forum emphatically panned the Adani project, Webster said: \u201cRenewables ought to be our focus.\u201d She said she would not be afraid to cross the floor of parliament on a range of issues. Webster is seeking to continue the Nationals\u2019 hold over the seat after it was vacated by Andrew Broad following allegations of inappropriate conduct during an official government trip overseas. The forum was divided on whether there needed to be a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan, with Webster and the independent Cecilia Moar, a former farmer, opposed, and the independents Jason Modica, Allen Ridgeway and Ray Kingston in support."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
