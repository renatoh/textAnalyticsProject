No word on whether it's been crippled by Sony's usual user-hostile attitude to copy protection (qv MiniDisc, CDs with \"rootkits\", Magic Gated MP3 players etc) but Gizmodo says: \"The books will be available through the Connect Store, and there is some Connect software for managing your books (so far this is the only drawback). Random House, HarperCollins Publishers, Penguin-Putnam, Simon &amp; Schuster and Time Warner Book Group are all on board with titles, along with Manga publisher Tokyopop. Sony is promising to deliver this reader by Spring.\" Incidentally, Gizmodo has already filed a ton of CES stories -- my guesstimate is more than 50, less than 100 -- here/ Current top story is Samsung's 82\" LCD TV.
