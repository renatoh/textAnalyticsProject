A group of 80 clergy and 20 leading laity from the Diocese of Oxford said that they were seeking a meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury and would plead with him to intervene to stop the appointment. If it went ahead, they would regard the leadership of the diocese as \"separating themselves\" from the Church of England, Dr Philip Giddings, a lay minister speaking on behalf of opponents of the appointment, told reporters at Church House, Oxford. However, the Bishop of Oxford, the Rt Rev Richard Harries, responded immediately by insisting that he stood by his choice. In a statement this afternoon, he said: \"Before long (Dr John) will have won the trust of the people in his area, and my support of him remains unswerving.\" Dr Giddings, a licensed lay minister at Greyfriars Church, Reading, said that the evangelical clergy, including the leaders of most of the largest churches in the diocese, had written privately to the Bishop of Oxford to express their \"dismay\" over the appointment. He said: \"Our representatives have met twice with the Bishop of Oxford. We have pleaded with him to do all in his power to intervene so that the appointment does not take place,\" he said. \"We are now seeking a meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury to express the same plea.\" He said that they opposed the nomination because it went against the \"plain meaning of scripture\", 2,000 years of Christian tradition and the \"divinely created order and gift of marriage\". He added: \"Perhaps, above all, we feel that this appointment will be catastrophic in terms of the unity of the church - not only the Church of England and the Anglican communion, which it threatens to split asunder, but also between the Anglican Church and other churches worldwide.\" Dr Giddings warned: \"For these reasons, we believe that, if this appointment proceeds, the Bishop of Oxford, and by implication the leadership of the Diocese of Oxford, will be separating themselves from the Church of England and the Anglican communion. \"This will have grave structural, pastoral and financial implications, as well as provoking discussions about appropriate oversight in the future if this plan proceeds. \"The gravest consequence will be to the Anglican Church's witness to the name of Christ in our land. May God have mercy on us all and give those in authority Godly wisdom at this time.\" His comments came after Dr John issued a lengthy written statement in which he said he wanted to alleviate the \"dismay\" over his appointment. Describing his 27-year, now celibate \"life partnership\" with another man as a \"gift and vocation from God\", he insisted that he would not be a \"maverick\". He called for a new climate of tolerance in which all parts of the church could \"see past the labels we stick on each other.\" Dr John said that he wanted to \"clear up a number of points\" in the statement, which was published on the Diocese of Oxford website. \"I realise the dismay which my nomination as Bishop of Reading has caused some individuals and church communities in the Archdeaconry of Berkshire and beyond,\" he said. \"I understand and respect those concerns, which I know are based on a genuine desire to be faithful to Christ. In so far as I can, I would like to try to alleviate them.\" Dr John said that he had had \"frank, friendly, prayerful and constructive\" meetings with the main objectors to his nomination. \"It is this kind of personal exchange that can best help us see past the labels we stick on each other, and realise that we are all genuinely trying to serve the God we love as members of his son's body.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
