A good example occurred two weeks ago as the year's third quarter ended. The FTSE-100 dropped by almost 3 per cent in the final three trading days of September. Two of the daily drops were larger than 1 per cent. The trigger was a flood of sell orders from institutions trying to protect profits accumulated in the last six months. The downtrend quickly reversed. The FTSE-100 clawed back all losses in the first three trading days of October, gaining at least 1 per cent each day. There were no surprising revelations on any broad economic or political dimension to explain any of these price gyrations. Many private investors are increasingly fearful of volatility. It heightens perceptions of danger and the unpredictable nature of the market. Statisticians measure volatility in several ways. One approach is simply to tally each of the stock market's daily zigs and zags. History teaches that the total of all daily price fluctuations in an average year typically reaches about 150 per cent of an index's starting point. In other words, if the FTSE-100 sits at 4000 on 1 January, history suggests it will experience about 6000 points of daily price fluctuations (up and down) in the next 12 months. This trend has run since 1935, when daily price records started being collected in a systematic manner in the UK. To put these fluctuations into perspective, the stock market typically shifted just 18 per cent per year during the past 100 years. Its average 'range' - a statistical term to describe the swing between the year's high and low points - is not much higher. Viewed from this angle, inter-day volatility is an important stock market phenomenon, despite the fact that most investors try to ignore it. Although volatility is not new, an important change has occurred in recent years. It is increasing. Each of the past five years earned a top 10 placement on the long-term volatility league tables; 2002 topped the recent list and was the third most volatile year ever recorded. One other period with higher inter-day volatility occurred in the mid-1970s, a frightening era of major political and economic instability. We suffered from very high inflation, oil shortages, aggressive labour union behaviour, and worst of all, widespread belief that the gov- ernment of the day lost its ability to govern. Happily, economic and political conditions are much better today. As always in a healthy democracy, there are wide differences in opinion about the skill and effectiveness of the government in power. There is also widespread agreement that current economic conditions are far from perfect. But compared to the mid-1970s, present economic and political conditions are not life-threatening. Viewed from this vantage point, persistently high volatility of the magnitude seen in recent years is a curious event. Other approaches to measuring volatility produce similar results. There were 106 occasions in 2002 when prices rose or fell at least 1 per cent on a single trading day. On this measure, 2002 was the fifth most volatile year on record. Here too, the only worse years were in the mid-1970s. Big daily price swings are continuing right up to the present, with 70 in the first three quarters of the year. We are right on course to produce another above-average year on this measure of volatility. Unlike the temporary volatility spurt of the 1970s, the current cycle is probably here to stay. The likely cause is a growing willingness by institutions and private individuals to try to capture small profit opportunities. A significant decline in online broker commissions allows investors to exploit situations that were uneconomic to pursue in the past. Changing trading practices have two unexpected consequences. Positions are kept open for a shorter period of time and investors are quicker to terminate them if events do not go according to plan. Both boost the frequency of short-term price spikes and sudden drops. Several new investment alternatives such as contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting also contribute to changing investment fashions. These are leveraged investment vehicles, which means investors risk big losses should the trend unexpectedly turn. In addition, there are carrying costs based upon the length of time an investment is held. Each factor encourages short-term investing. The new investment options are quite popular. Precise figures are hard to come by, but CFDs are widely believed to now account for more than 20 per cent of all UK equity trades. Most experts think this figure will increase in the near future. Angus McCrone of One Way Bets, the UK's leading CFD and spread betting website, believes most CFD trades by private investors are closed within three trading days. Another important factor boosting short-term volatility is the growing use of programme trading by City institutions. These often involve simultaneously buying and selling a basket of different shares, with precise entry and exit points specified by sophisticated computer analysis. The size and suddenness of some programme trades causes big swings on broad market indices. Stock market expert David Buik of Cantor Index estimates that a whopping 30-40 per cent of all activity on the London Stock Exchange is currently triggered by institutional programme trading. This figure is also likely to grow in a vicious circle of rising volatility triggering more programme trading triggering further volatility, etc. Given all these profound changes in investment practices, it seems safe to assume that high volatility is here to stay. Many private investors fear it, but to prosper in the new investment world, this attitude must change. Investors must learn to treat volatility as an ally, not an enemy. This is especially true when broad stock market indices drift sideways, like at present. Buying and holding shares for the long-term has become yesterday's strategy. The name of today's investment game is to invest in individual shares with good prospects, not a broad cross-section of the stock market. Investors must learn to expect limited price appreciation and be quick to take the profits. Short-term volatility can be a friend and ally at times like this. When appropriate, use sudden price dips as an opportunity to buy shares. By the same token, sudden price spikes often provides investors with an opportunity to take profits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
