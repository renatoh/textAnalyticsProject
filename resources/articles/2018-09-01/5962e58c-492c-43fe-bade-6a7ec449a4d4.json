The Argentinian central defender disagrees with suggestions he has swapped last season\u2019s relegation battle in south Wales for a similar skirmish on Tyneside, maintaining it is far too early to make such comparisons. With Swansea in the Championship, Fern\u00e1ndez headed north for an August reunion with his former Napoli manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez. His form alongside Jamaal Lascelles has been solid but, collectively, Newcastle have struggled and could do with securing their first win of the season, at home to Leicester on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy,\u201d said Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cBut defensively we\u2019ve been all right, the games have been tight, we just need more goals. We know we have to improve.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s meagre haul of two points does not alarm him. \u201cThere\u2019s no panic at the moment, none at all,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s still early. We\u2019ve played the big teams and now Leicester\u2019s a big game. I don\u2019t really want to compare this team with Swansea last year but no player wants to be involved in two relegations in a row. At the moment I see no reason for panic. We have a good mentality, we work hard in training and I don\u2019t know why you compare Newcastle to Swansea. I don\u2019t like this. We\u2019re a really good squad.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez is pleased to be reunited with Ben\u00edtez. \u201cRafa hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the same ideas and he\u2019s still very thorough. He\u2019s very experienced. It\u2019s still all about the work on the training ground. If anything, there\u2019s even more detail from him. He tries to improve everyone. \u201cHis critics need to understand what it\u2019s like playing against the big teams. People say we\u2019re too defensive but we believe in the manager and what he tells us. Keeping it tight is our best chance to get something out of games. One win can kickstart our season. Last season this club finished 10th; we can do the same again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
