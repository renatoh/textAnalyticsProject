Oh, now hang on a minute . . .\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"Our boys have faced far more hostile atmospheres than they will at Highbury. When you go to Anfield, a Liverpool v Manchester United game is fantastic. And as for Leeds United at Elland Road? Deary me!\" What he meant: \"Let's face facts, southerners are just a load of passionless middle-class jessies.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"It doesn't matter if we are playing Manchester United or Coventry.\" What he meant: \"Since relegation from the Premiership the Sky Blues have gone into financial and footballing freefall. We can but dream.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"My players behave themselves properly. They always do. They have a good discipline record and that requires good discipline within themselves and from the club management.\" What he meant: \"If I order the Nevilles to give a Spaniard a kicking for tactical reasons, they give him a kicking for tactical reasons, but his mob just does what they like when they like.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"We had the best record in the Premier League last season and this season with the fewest fouls committed.\" What he meant: \"They kick us more often than we do them, but remember: it's quality not quantity that counts.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"The experience of players like Keane, Scholes and Giggs holds you in good stead.\" What he meant: \"We've snarled and sworn at hundreds more linesmen and chased dozens more referees across the pitch than they have and that means we've got a head start because the officials are already scared of us before we kick off.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"And who is most sinned against? Arsenal.\" What he meant: \"It wasn't us who started it. Just look at the number of times Robert Pires has been blown over in the penalty area.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"The hype has maybe gone over the top\" What he meant: \"Ashley Cole is certain to go over the top.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"I have no doubt about Ashley's commitment to us.\" What he meant: \"Ashley Cole will be totally focused tomorrow night. Probably on Phil Neville's right shin.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"Chelsea look as if they have an unassailable lead but you keep thinking of football as a game that can change completely.\" What he meant: \"Chelsea look unbeatable but Arsenal went 49 games undefeated and look at them now: they are getting caned off Bolton.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"We don't really know where Rooney plays at the moment. Is he a second striker or a main striker?\" What he meant: \"Or a diving bastard? Personally I'd play him in the hole. And then have a bulldozer push five tons of gravel on top of him.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"There will certainly be plenty of focus on the game.\" What he meant: \"You lot better keep your eyes on things because anything the Arsenal players get up to will pass completely under the other guy's radar.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"We always try to play football, which we love. That is the most important thing.\" What he meant: \"I am an incurable soccer romantic who has totally forgotten his past limpet-like attachment to Martin Keown.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"We are chasing the sands of time now.\" What he meant: \"See, it's not just that Frenchman who does all the deep, philosophical and poetic stuff.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"My team will need to perform at its best.\" What he meant: \"I am confident if the players give everything this time the pizza will hit him straight in the kisser.\" Sir Alex Ferguson \"On form, us and Chelsea are the two best teams in the country. I don't think Arsenal would argue with that.\" What he meant: \"We're better than you, Frenchie. Do you want to make something of it?\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \"Sometimes these game are very tight and sometimes they are very open. You just don't know.\" What he meant: \"Pay-per-view? Well, you just don't know, do you? It's like buying a pig-in-a-poke, isn't it?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
