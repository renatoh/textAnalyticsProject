For a new and markedly Scottish Prime Minister, it had the advantage of being an English resort that was close enough to London for him to nip back and deal with crises, of which there have been more than he could have imagined possible. If he had gone to Cape Cod, however, or Martha's Vineyard, the Hamptons, Palm Beach or any other expensive American resort, he might have noticed a phenomenon that will cause a crisis: very rich, very old people. In the villages of the Cape, arguments about how far the Massachusetts resort should go in accommodating them are the basics of local politics. When an abandoned school came on the market, for instance, a typical split opened up. The Catholic church wanted to restore and reopen it. Developers wanted to turn it into flats for wealthy retirees and were backed by the local paper, which said that boisterous children wouldn't really fit in. Similar debates about whether the young or the old should come first are going on across the developed world. In Britain, Brown's decision to launch a huge house-building programme puts him on the side of the young, who need cheaper homes, and against the old, who want their property values to carry on rising. Running alongside the inter-generational conflicts are arguments about wealth distribution within the generations. Brown has helped the poorest pensioners, but, as the Liberal Democrats pointed out last week, has done nothing for private-sector workers, who must pay ever more money into public-sector pension schemes, while seeing their own grasping bosses accumulate fantastic retirement packages. So far, we're on the familiar territory of quarrels about who gets what. But in the richest parts of the rich world, where the men and women who can afford to holiday at Cape Cod have their homes, an old inequality between who lives and who dies is being sharpened to a degree never seen before in human history. Earlier this year, Westminster Primary Care Trust surveyed life expectancy in central London. The borough is the most socially divided in Europe. On the one hand, it includes Knightsbridge and Belgravia, some of the most expensive plots of land on the planet, and the villas around the canals of Little Venice, which aren't noticeably cheaper. On the other, it has estates such as Church Street for the white working-class and immigrants who arrive at Victoria Coach Station on the cheapest available tickets from Europe. The trust was 'startled' by its 'striking findings'. On average, rich women aged 65 in Little Venice can now expect to live until they're nearly 96. By contrast, 65-year-old women on the Churchill Gardens estate can expect to live until they're 77. Westminster men will die slightly younger, but the differences in life expectancy between rich and poor are almost identical. Danny Dorling, a social analyst from Leeds University, said the Westminster figures were without precedent. The rich have always lived longer than the poor. But when you used to read statistics showing that a child born to wealthy parents lived, say, 10 years longer than a child born to working-class parents, the figures were averaged out over lifetimes. They reflected the deaths of poor children in infancy and of poor young men from drug or alcohol abuse. Now, researchers are finding huge divergences in life expectancy, not from the baseline of birth, but of retirement at 65. 'The only other place in the West you can find anything like what is happening in London is Manhattan,' Dorling said. Dr Margaret Guy, director of public health for Westminster, blamed the varying death rates on raised cholesterol and smoking, vices you don't need money to avoid. Anyone can give up cigarettes, eat vegetables and cut down on alcohol and salt, which is why today's demands for smoking bans and better diet are so shrill. But when all the exhortations for the masses to live healthier lives have been exhausted, the residents of Belgravia and Little Venice can still buy healthcare that isn't available on the NHS and their blunt economic power is growing in importance. One of the most unjustly neglected books of the year is Bryan Appleyard's How to Live Forever or Die Trying. In part, it is an entertaining tour of the cultists who believe they can find immortality by freezing their bodies or submitting themselves to near-starvation diets. Men and women who had it all when they were young in the Sixties believe that death may become optional now they're old. 'The boomers are the last generation who will die the \"old-fashioned way\", from debilitating progressive conditions,' cries Ray Kurzweil, an American guru whom Appleyard quotes. We must keep ourselves alive until technology comes to our rescue. He sounds a preposterous fantasist, but Kurzweil may be half-right. Life expectancy is lengthening faster than anyone predicted 25 year ago and there is an explosion in medical interest in tackling the conditions of old age, not least because rich, old people will pay whatever it costs to carry on living past 100. And if the new organ transplant techniques work or drugs are found to treat arteriosclerosis, the great killer of the elderly, many will do just that. Appleyard predicts a future of super-rich old people living on accumulated interest from their investments and super-poor young people, whose numbers include not only the overwhelming majority of the world's population who can't afford expensive medicine, but the children of the rich who are denied their inheritances because their parents refuse to die. You can see what he means already in a small way. Kate Barker of the Bank of England, who advised Brown on the housing shortage, said the main reason for spiralling prices wasn't mass immigration, planning restrictions or speculative buying - although all three mattered - but elderly people who weren't dying as early as their ancestors and releasing their homes on to the market when they went. On second thoughts, maybe Brown doesn't need to go to Cape Cod - he can see the future right here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
