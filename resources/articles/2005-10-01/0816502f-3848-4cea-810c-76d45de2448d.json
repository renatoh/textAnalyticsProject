With depressing regularity women are exhorted to reduce their risk of breast cancer by changing their \"lifestyle\" - by exercising, dieting, giving up alcohol - by regularly checking their breasts, and/or getting screened. And yet all these \"risks\" cannot fully account for almost 70% of the breast cancer cases in this country. As Emma Taggart of Breakthrough Breast Cancer points out (Letters, October 3), breast cancer is a \"complex interplay of lifestyle, environment, genetic, and hormonal factors\" such that continuously placing the onus of avoidance on women alone is far too simplistic. According to Cancer Research UK's own statistics, the breast cancer incidence in this country has increased from one in 12 women in 1996 to one in nine in 2001. It is, therefore, the contention of the UK Working Group for the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer that the cancer establishment and government's focus on lifestyle and genetic factors has done little to reduce the overall toll of this disease. It is time to open up the discussion about what constitutes a \"risk\" to encompass the well-documented problems caused by the use and release into our environment of carcinogenic substances and oestrogen-mimicking toxins which are invariably dismissed by the \"cancer community\" and government as being too \"complicated\" to address.
