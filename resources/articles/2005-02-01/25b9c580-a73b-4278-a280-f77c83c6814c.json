The Premierleague leaders turned down an offer from Everton for the Dutch midfielder during the transfer window and Ricksen was so flattered that he has now signed a new deal. \"The fact that the club did not accept a good offer for me in January showed their commitment to me as a player -and now I want to show my commitment to Rangers in return,\" he said. \"That is why I have signed this deal.\" The 28-year-old, who would have been out of contract in the summer, added that the return of Barry Ferguson from Blackburn convinced him that the club is going in the right direction. \"Barry Ferguson coming back to the club also helped me to make up my mind and I believe we have a real opportunity to be successful. I am looking forward to being part of that success in the years to come,\" he told the official club website. The Dutchman has transformed himself into one of Rangers' most influential players and their manager Alex McLeish was determined to hold on to the player, even in the face of what was reported as being a substantial offer from Everton. Ricksen joined Rangers in the summer of 2000 from AZ Alkmaar but initially struggled with major disciplinary problems. As well as picking up too many yellow and red cards, he made history when he became the first player in Scottish football to be handed a retrospective suspension after television pictures showed him aiming a kung-fu-style kick at an opponent. Ricksen, however, is now a reformed character and has reinvented himself as one of Rangers' most important players. McLeish said yesterday that he was extremely pleased to have the Dutchman on board for another four years. \"He is a great person to have around the club,\" the manager said, \"and, in the last eight months, has proved not just his skill and dedication but also his strength of character.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
