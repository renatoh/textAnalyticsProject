You may think that a snippet of stoic philosophy may be a little heavy to digest on a Monday morning. But given that fewer than one in 10 people in the UK \"never\" find their work stressful, according to the latest British Social Attitudes (BSA) report, it something that we need to swallow. In 1989 twice as many workers said they had a stress-free job, adds the National Centre for Social Research study. Stress appears to be endemic in the UK workplace. Stress-related illness is said to account for more than 13m sick days a year - and a 14-year study of 10,000 civil servants published last month suggests that those who say they suffer from chronic stress at work are more likely to develop heart disease and diabetes. Figures obtained by the Conservative party last week show that the number of people claiming incapacity benefit owing to stress has increased by 200% to almost 50,000 in 10 years. Of course, some workers' lives are blighted by chronic work-related stress. But to say the workplace is far more stressful than a generation ago is going too far. Admittedly, Britons work some of the longest hours in the EU and a culture of presenteeism still blights Blighty. But anxiety in the workplace should not be much higher than 18 years ago. Research shows our jobs are no less secure than before, self-employment is not rising significantly and most of us are on permanent contracts. So, where is the stress linked with work coming from? The answer lies outside the office: over-inflated housing costs, childcare, schooling and career expectations, caring for a rapidly ageing population and a pensions timebomb make everyday work seem more stressful than it did to early generations. Linda McKie, a professor of sociology at Glasgow Caledonian University, did a research project with working women in their 50s. \"We found that middle-class women, in particular, were worried about income post-retirement, while working-class women didn't have any expectations because they couldn't imagine entering that arena. But all saw themselves working well into their 60s. \" We are a society that expects more - we certainly go on more holidays than our parents' generation and we still define ourselves by the job we do. Working women with young children are among those to report poor job satisfaction - mainly due to returning to work that is part-time and low-paid. And it is among working mothers and their partners that the pressure of living in an income-obsessed society appears greatest. Although men's working hours have fallen, says the BSA report, an increase in the hours worked by women means that longer hours are being worked in two-earner families. Humans are social creatures and isolation can be stressful. Surprisingly it is couples with children who feel isolated, as adults who live alone are more like to see their families and friends than co-habiting couples, an Edinburgh University study found. \"The pressure points are in couple households, married or co-habiting, with kids where it is very hard to engage in the same social networks,\" says McKie. \"You may engage with other parents at school gate but on the whole engagement can be limited because people feel time-pressured, feeling that they have to always be doing something, kids have to be somewhere.\" No wonder the BSA report says 84% of women and 82% of men want more time with their family. As they say: cashrich, time-poor; time-rich, cash-poor. Just try not to stress too much about it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
