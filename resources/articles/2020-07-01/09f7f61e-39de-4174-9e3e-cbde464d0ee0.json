Attacking the prime minister\u2019s decision as \u201ccoming out of the blue\u201d, a report published on Thursday from the Commons international development committee (IDC) said it was likely it would be disruptive and \u201cincredibly costly\u201d. Publishing its final report from its inquiry into the effectiveness of UK aid, the IDC raised concerns about the lack of consultation ahead of the merger and asked for a full explanation to be given to parliament, including why the decision had been taken amid a pandemic and when the UK aid budget was facing multi-billion-pound cuts. The committee also called on the government to outline its plans for DfiD\u2019s staff and experts and to clarify how its \u201crefreshed international policy\u201d would help towards meeting the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals, to which the UK is committed. In an interim report on 9 June, the IDC had recommended the retention of DfiD. Just 10 days later, the prime minister announced the merger with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The committee outlined the \u201cglowing reviews\u201d it had heard of DfiD\u2019s work to help the world\u2019s poorest people and the department\u2019s retention of development specialists which, the IDC said, was essential to the UK\u2019s position as a power on the world stage. Expressing fears over whether poverty reduction would remain a key goal of government policy, the report called for a cabinet minister for development to be retained. There are fears the UK merger may reflect the worst aspects of similar, costly mergers in Australia and Canada. Both experienced a loss of experts that damaged those countries\u2019 international reputations. The IDC welcomed Johnson\u2019s commitment to continue spending 0.7% of gross national income on development, but called for a transparency in the government\u2019s future aid strategy. It expressed concerns over scrutiny and recommended the Commons create a new select committee to oversee UK aid spending. The IDC chair, the Labour MP Sarah Champion, said: \u201cWe have now come to the end of our deep-dive into how effective UK aid is. Our evidence shows DfiD has a glowing reputation overseas, its expertise envied and its aid programmes delivering a lifeline for many of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable. DfiD gives the UK considerable international standing and is something we should all be proud of. \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that the government failed to recognise these strengths as it made its impulsive move to have the FCO swallow up DfiD. Now we are on the brink of this expertise being lost and our international reputation being damaged beyond repair. \u201cThe fact that there was no consultation, seemingly no evidence as to why this is a good idea, really lets down the communities that UK aid is there to support.\u201d The merger has caused widespread dismay among international development groups and many praised the IDC\u2019s findings. Stephanie Draper, chief executive of Bond, a UK network for NGOs, said the report called into question not only the timing but \u201cthe entire rationale of the government\u2019s decision to merge DfiD and the FCO\u201d. Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: \u201cThe committee is right \u2013 the demise of DfiD is likely to do real damage to the world\u2019s poorest people and to Britain\u2019s international standing. \u201cBritish people expect our aid to be used for the benefit of those without clean water, medicines or food. But the timing and presentation of this merger clearly indicate that it was primarily about politics rather than becoming more effective in helping people to escape poverty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
