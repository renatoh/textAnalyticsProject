Not in so many words, of course, he is much too disciplined for that. It just came out when he was asked about that other much-criticised form of enforced sharing, mixed-sex hospital wards. He doesn't like them. This was Clegg's first day not-being-in-charge of the government while David Cameron is on holiday in sunny Cornwall. Clegg has already had a break in even sunnier Spain, so this was no time to gloat. \"I am not acting prime minister \u2026 it's a straightforward issue. I'm holding the fort in a spirit of partnership,\" Clegg explained in an ungloating way. He held the fort at what was billed as a \"town meeting\" but was actually a staff audience at MSN UK, Microsoft's portal offering news, gossip, sport, celebrity and deputy prime ministers, at the software giant's London HQ near Victoria station. The MSN audience obviously warmed to Clegg's calm rationality and refrained from asking questions much harder than \"How will AV strengthen our constitution?\" and \"What are your views on Trident?\" The deputy PM sat on a stool but stood and waved his arms a bit when he got animated (a bit). The thrust of what he had to tell them was that the coalition is not proving to be the \"insipid mush\" they had feared, but is radical and decisive, if anything too radical and decisive on account of its strong sense of purpose. He was really sorry about the cuts and that VAT increase. It was wholesome stuff, though a bit vague on details and overly prone to blame Labour for any problem, including those Blair and Brown didn't create and even half-solved. On housing policy he was deftly disingenuous, as if he had been doing this sort of thing for years. Asked about his favourite biscuit, a notorious trap for politicians, he stumbled but quickly recovered. Rich tea if dunked, Hobnobs if undunked. Where it sounded sticky came when he was asked to confirm that Andrew Lansley is about to abolish mixed-sex wards (again) in hospitals. Clegg's distaste for this sort of carry-on could not have been clearer. \"We want to see the end of mixed-sex wards, everyone knows this has to end,\" he said. Vince Cable could not have put it better. Two different types of people with different values, traditions and aspirations were never meant to be sharing the same ward. It isn't right. \"It is really difficult for people on wards where they do not have the privacy they need, they find it uncomfortable at a time when they are vulnerable, not sure what's going to happen to them,\" Clegg added. How true, how true. Lib Dem MPs and activists worried by collapsing opinion polls can only take comfort from such a sensitive assessment. Which among them would want to get out of the coalition bed for a pee in the wee small hours and a risk of meeting Eric Pickles in his pyjamas if it could be avoided? Or wake up and find Ken Clarke snoring in the next bed if they could find Ming instead? Of course, Nick could not say so, not openly. You have to speak in code in coalitions and pretend that swine Cameron really deserves his Cornish holiday instead of being dunked in boiling oil. Good old Nick, the smoothie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
