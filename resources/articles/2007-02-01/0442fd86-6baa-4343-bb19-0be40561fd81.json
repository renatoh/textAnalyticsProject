We have several based around football. Each class adopts a nation during the European championships or the World Cup and looks at it in all subjects: languages, history, geography, food technology. We'll be working with the Olympics, too. This fits nicely with citizenship. One of the big things with KS3 reform is citizenship, looking at national identity and understanding other cultures. Citizenship has a very important part to play: helping and supporting others, becoming a global citizen. I like the idea of pupils getting out and doing more; I'm an advocate of outdoor trips and theatre visits. Relevance is crucial, and I would like to see pupils coming out as better citizens in a global society, so languages are very important; English isn't enough. Carol Vincent Parent, London Learning outside the classroom is a very good move, as children have so little opportunity to get out and make connections between what they are learning and the outside world. I think teenagers would find visits to theatres, galleries, museums and sports centres very engaging. I think the current plans are very promising, but they could lead to only minor changes in many schools, as staff won't want to risk their KS3 Sats results. My other concern would be if field trips and work in the community are only seen as options for the disaffected, while the more academically orientated stay in the classroom. TJ Taylor Aged 14, Barnsley One of the main things is more life and domestic skills - you need to know basic things like washing and ironing, and how to cook healthy food yourself. And ICT, because computers are more and more in everyday life now, especially working life, so the more ICT knowledge you have, the more you're prepared for leaving school. Languages need to be appropriate to what pupils want. I did German, but I'll probably never go to Germany. All lessons should be tailored to different learning styles. Music, drama, art, those expressive skills that are specific to people, should be optional. People who don't want to do them spoil them for everyone else. We went on a theatre trip to see Blood Brothers, which is an amazing play, but a lot of people had been forced into going and there was a lot of coughing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
