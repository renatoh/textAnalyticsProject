The 2016 results of the Nationally Consistent Collection of Data on Disability showed 18.1% or 685,911 students received an educational adjustment due to disability. Some 5.7% already get targeted support but a further total of 12.4% of students need extensive, substantial or supplementary educational support due to disability that do not currently receive it. According to the Australian Education Union\u2019s analysis of the data, that means 469,000 students have a disability or learning difficulty while in 2015 schools only received funding to support 200,000 students with a disability, as shown by the Productivity Commission\u2019s review of government services. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, has responded to the data by noting it will be used to provide extra money for every student with a disability over the 10 years of the Gonski 2.0 schools funding plan. The survey found that 8% of students nationwide needed supplementary adjustment to learning, such as course materials in accessible forms, separate supervision or extra time to complete assessment tasks. Some 2.9% required substantial adjustment for learning, such as \u201cconsiderable adult assistance\u201d, and 1.5% needed extensive adjustments, meaning those students who had complex needs such as treatment of medical conditions, communications systems and mobility issues. Public schools had higher proportions of both those that needed substantial adjustments (3.3%) and extensive adjustments (1.9%). In December, Birmingham questioned the quality of last year\u2019s data due to discrepancies between the states but the new 2016 figures are in line with 2015 data showing a total of 12.5% needed extensive, substantial or supplementary support. The AEU\u2019s federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the figures \u201cconfirmed the crisis in disability education in Australia\u201d. \u201cWe cannot continue with a system that leaves behind some of our most vulnerable students and fails to give them the help they need to reach their potential,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Coalition promised to fund schools to support all students with disability from 2015 and it hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cThe question now is what action will education minister Simon Birmingham take to deal with this chronic underfunding?\u201d On Thursday, Birmingham said that collection of nationally consistent disability data had taken years of work with the states and as part of the federal reforms that data will now be used to make funding decisions. The education minister said that data collection had improved and KPMG had found it was \u201cbroadly reliable\u201d. He said the government planned to \u201cfully deliver on implementation of the [nationally consistent collection of disability data] process\u201d, meaning that in the future every student identified would receive a disability loading. \u201cAnd, importantly, what that will do is ensure that support for students with a disability is geared most heavily to those students who need the greatest adjustment and assistance in the classroom.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow assistant minister for schools, Andrew Giles, called on the government to \u201curgently release the details of the new loading \u2013 including the amounts payable at each level of adjustment, and how much each state and system will receive compared to current provisions\u201d. Giles accused Birmingham of being \u201call talk and no action\u201d in providing disability funding. \u201cIt\u2019s just not good enough that today every Australian doesn\u2019t count when it comes to schooling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
