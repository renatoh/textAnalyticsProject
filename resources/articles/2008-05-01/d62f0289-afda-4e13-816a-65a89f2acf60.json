That was the typically colourful analogy employed by Alex Murphy as he looked ahead to today's televised Carnegie Challenge Cup derby between two of the clubs he previously coached, Warrington and St Helens, and for once he could not be accused of hyperbole. Warrington have not won at Knowsley Road since 1994, have not beaten Saints anywhere in 22 matches since 2001, and have not knocked them out of the cup for 39 years, with their latest defeat coming in the quarter-finals last June. They were desperately unconvincing in ending a four-match losing run against Huddersfield last week, while St Helens, the cup holders who have not failed to reach the quarter-finals since 2000, produced their best performance of the season in demolishing Wigan 57-16. \"It's going to be tough,\" conceded Morley, who has added control to his aggression since succeeding Lee Briers as Warrington's captain this season, and has been arguably the most consistent of the game's most infamously unpredictable team. \"Saints are a champion side, and as they showed in Cardiff when they get a roll on they are a massive attacking force. \"But this is do or die for us, and we've got confidence from the fact that we've been competitive against them twice this year already. We actually led for the majority of those games. So I don't think there is any psychological barrier for us playing against Saints. We're not helped by the fact that they always raise their game against us. The thing we've got to do is play for the full 80, because in the past we have been guilty of letting our foot off the gas when we could be putting games to bed.\" The former St Helens loose forward Vinnie Anderson returns for Warrington after missing the Huddersfield game, while Saints are still without their ex-Wolves captain Paul Sculthorpe and have a doubt over Paul Wellens, although Maurie Fa'asavalu may be back to leave them close to a full-strength pack. There are three equally intriguing all-Super League ties tomorrow, beginning with the televised tie between Hull KR and Huddersfield. Catalans Dragons, last year's beaten finalists, face Bradford at Odsal, and the cup favourites Leeds visit Harlequins at the Stoop. Hull travel to Widnes in a repeat of the 1982 final that went to a replay, and Wakefield also face National League opposition at Barrow, while one lower-division club is guaranteed to reach the quarter finals as Dewsbury play Oldham. Wigan, whose home tie against Whitehaven will be played on Monday night to ensure a pristine surface at the JJB Stadium for Manchester United tomorrow, conceded yesterday that they will be forced to concede home advantage should they reach the last eight, because the pitch is to be relaid in June. Australia beat New Zealand 28-12 at the Sydney Cricket Ground yesterday in their last international before this autumn's World Cup, and dedicated the win to Jack Gibson - widely regarded as the greatest ever rugby league coach - who died a few hours before kick-off at the age of 79."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
