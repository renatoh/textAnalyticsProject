Creon (TJ Murphy) 50-1 2. GVA Ireland (FJ Flood) 14-1 3. Alexanderthegreat (R Walsh) 25-1 Jonjo O'Neill repeated last year's Pertemps Final success as Creon (50-1) swooped late to snatch the spoils in the closing race. Half a dozen horses were in with a shout jumping the final flight and it looked at one stage as if G V A Ireland, who had raced in the leading pack throughout, would hang on. But Timmy Murphy conjured a great burst from the JP McManus-owned nine-year-old and they prevailed by half a length. Alexanderthegreat was a length back in third, with His Nibs in fourth. The Morris-trained favourite Keepatem (4-1) was one of those in with a real chance at the last after travelling well, but could not find any more for David Casey. 4.40pm: Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup Handicap Chase (3m\u00bdf) 1. Maximise (D Edwards) 40-1 2. Merchants Friend (P Cashman) 20-1 3. Ibis Rochelais (T Greenall) 7-1f Martin Pipe made it a Festival double when Maximize got up in the shadow of the post to record a 40-1 upset in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup Handicap Chase. The Charlie Mann-trained Merchants Friend (20-1) had looked all over the winner after being left in front with a circuit to run. He still held a healthy advantage going to the last, but struggled on the run-in as Darren Edwards galvanised Maximize for a one-length success. It was a timely first win in 73 rides for Darren Edwards. 4pm: William Hill National Hunt Handicap Chase (3m\u00bdf) 1. Fork Lighning (R Thornton) 7-1 2. Shardam (C Llewellyn) 11-2 3. Royal Auclair (R Walsh) 7-1 Fork Lightning struck a blow for the novice division by beating seasoned campaigners in the William Hill National Hunt Handicap Chase. Leading two out, the eight-year-old grey shrugged off the persistent challenge of Shardam to give trainer Alan King his first Festival winner. The 7-1 shot, ridden by Robert Thornton, beat Shardam by two lengths, with Royal Auclair a further nine lengths away in third. 3.20pm: Smurfit Champion Hurdle (2m\u00bdf) 1. Hardy Eustace (C O'Dwyer) 33-1 2. Rooster Booster (R Johnson) 11-8 3. Intersky Falcon (L Cooper) 8-1 Hardy Eustace produced the first shock of the Festival to beat defending champion Rooster Boster in the Smurfit Champion Hurdle. Conor O'Dwyer appeared to set a steady pace on last year's Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Hurdle winner as reigning champion Rooster Booster lobbed along at the back of the field. Richard Johnson took a pull on Rooster Booster approaching three fences out as he was going so well, and jumped the last narrowly in front. But Hardy Eustace found plenty in reserve up the hill and ran out an emphatic five-length winner in the end at odds of 33-1. 2.40pm: Irish Independent Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase (2m) 1 Well Chief (AP McCoy) 9-1 2. Kicking King (BJ Geraghty) 7-2 3. Le Duc (J Tizzard) 25-1 Tony McCoy registered his first win of Cheltenham with a narrow victory over Barry Geraghty's Kicking King - with favourite Thisthatandtother, ridden by Ruby Walsh, falling at the second. McCoy appeared to have built up a comfortable lead, only to jump the final poorly and give Kicking King hope. Despite a spirited fight, Well Chief held on up the Cheltenham hill to give Martin Pipe a welcome win. 2pm: Letheby &amp; Christopher Supreme Novices' Hurdle (2m\u00bdf) 1. Brave Inca (BM Cash) 7-2f 2. War Of Attrition (C O'Dwyer) 33-1 3. Fleet Street (A Tinkler) 20-1 Brave Inca came through in the final couple of strides to win a thrilling Supreme Novices Hurdle by a neck on Cheltenham's first day. The 7/2 favourite got favourite-backers off to the best possible start but had to dig deep to get the better of the aptly-named War Of Attrition up the hill. Barry Cash's mount was in contention all the way through and, coming to the final fence, had pulled away with Conor O'Dwyer on War of Attrition. In an exciting finish, Cash managed to get the favourite ahead at the crucial moment and get the Irish off to the perfect start. Fleet Street, ridden by Andrew Tinkler stayed on well for third."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
