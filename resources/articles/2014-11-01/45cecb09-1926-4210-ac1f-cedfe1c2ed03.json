A rare chance to spend 24 hours reporting from inside the presidential bubble as he criss-crossed New England on the campaign trail last week also reveals a politician who is at times a shadow of the messianic figure that electrified US voters in 2008. With just three days to go until midterm elections that could cost his party control of the Senate, the commander-in-chief has been exiled to places where his plummeting approval ratings can do no harm. Rather than risk damaging the chances of moderate Democrats in key swing states, this increasingly polarising president is instead on the stump in less high-profile places, such as Portland, Maine, and Providence, Rhode Island, where the runways are too short for the full-size presidential plane and require Obama to fly on the scaled down version. On board the \u201cbaby AF1\u201d, Obama\u2019s aides deny rumours that he is frustrated to be campaigning almost exclusively for state governors rather than the US senators whose fate will determine the course of his last two years in Washington. \u201cThe view that is shared I think by everybody at the White House is that we want to do everything that we can to support candidates up and down the ballot,\u201d press secretary Josh Earnest tells me when I ask if the president misses being in the thick of things. \u201cThere are a variety of ways in which the president himself and his broader campaign team, including those outside the White House, can assist other candidates,\u201d he explains. Obama\u2019s own behaviour during the two-day trip makes it hard to avoid the suspicion that his heart is not entirely in it any more. On the return leg from Providence to Washington, the president strolls to the back of the plane to chat with reporters, not about the election or his recent speeches, but to ask for a favour. Despite there being just four crucial days before the election to hone his political message in the national news media, Obama wants to know if the reporters will let his press secretary skip their scheduled daily briefing, saying it is Halloween and Earnest \u201cdeserves a rest\u201d. I joke that the press secretary should instead be made to come back in fancy dress in that case, but Obama laughs it off and offers reporters chocolate cake, handshakes and chat in lieu of the promised \u201cgaggle\u201d. To his admirers, such incidents confirm the relaxed, \u201cno drama\u201d Obama who perhaps realises the futility of another soundbite at this late stage in an ailing campaign, but for many disillusioned Democrats they also suggest a politician less than willing to go the extra mile any more. On stage, there is a similar weariness on display even in the stump speech. \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot this time and this is the last election cycle in which I\u2019m involved as president,\u201d Obama tells a rally of 3,000 party supporters in Portland. \u201cLook, it makes you a little wistful, because I do like campaigning; it\u2019s fun.\u201d The contrast between the reality of a president fast heading for lame-duck status and his lingering trappings of power is particularly stark on the road, where even a scaled down Air Force One comes with an entourage unmatched by most heads of state. Twenty-two separate vehicles form the motorcade that ferries Obama between the various campaign stops in Maine and Rhode Island. Even in these relatively sparsely populated communities, hundreds of local residents line the closed-off roads, holding their smartphones aloft in mute salute to the passing president. Such scenes cause a stir in downtown Washington, but among the quiet wooded lanes of Maine, this snaking convoy has the feel of an alien invasion. Nevertheless, there is nothing like the logistical resources of the world\u2019s remaining superpower for giving politicians an efficient means to traverse a big country. From his Oval Office desk, via the helicopter that whisks him from the south lawn of the White House to Andrews air force base, Obama can be airborne on Air Force One within a matter of minutes. Wherever he lands, one of several eight-ton armoured cars, each known as The Beast, will have been flown in separately by cargo plane to speed him to his final destination. With the town of Providence at a standstill, the presidential motorcade easily slices though the prearranged schedule for an impromptu drop-in at a well-known local diner, so Obama can personally buy lunch and some of the chocolate cake that later gets used to bribe the press pool. His staff like to refer to such moments as the \u201cbear going on the loose\u201d, revelling in the photo-opportunities that surprise encounters with members of the public can throw up, but the reality is these choreographed episodes are highly stylised, rarely straying outside a few brief exchanges of pleasantries with the other customers. Less visible are the fundraising opportunities that have been such a major feature of Obama\u2019s 2014 campaign schedule. On this trip, the president hosts a reception at the beautiful woodland home of Bob Monks, the wealthy son of a former Republican Senate candidate of the same name. Tickets for the 25 invited donors start at $16,200, but the press is kept firmly at bay, waiting in a neighbour\u2019s living room while the Secret Service guards prowl the perimeter of the large estate in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. According to CBS reporter and informal White House statistician Mark Knoller, Obama\u2019s 1,070 flights on Air Force One, many to events such as this as well as other more formal business, are fast catching up with George W Bush\u2019s total of 1,675. These secretive fundraisers, typically held in some of the most stunning residential properties in America, have become a mainstay of the president\u2019s campaign efforts this year \u2013 his way of offering something to help the vulnerable Senate candidates who cannot afford to be seen alongside him at rallies but are in desperate need of cash for television advertising. Yet hints of the old Obama remain. During his gubernatorial rally in Maine, Mike Michaud \u2013 a former mill-worker who would become America\u2019s first openly gay elected governor, if successful on Tuesday \u2013 the president\u2019s speechwriters drift toward the catchphrases of his own election campaign: hope, change, progress. \u201cHope is a better choice,\u201d Obama tells the audience. \u201cHope is what gives those soldiers in world war two the courage to storm a beach. Hope is what allows young people to march on behalf of women\u2019s rights, and workers\u2019 rights, and civil rights, and voting rights, and gay rights, and immigration rights.\u201d And there are grounds for hope. Last year\u2019s bugbears \u2013 Obamacare, the lacklustre economy \u2013 appear increasingly tamed. This year\u2019s challenges \u2013 Ebola, Islamic State \u2013 may ultimately show the president\u2019s soundness of judgment. There is a chance that the Democrats may not lose as heavily as the polls suggest this week. Obama continues on the theme, sounding almost as if he may be speaking partly to himself: \u201cDon\u2019t buy into that cynicism. Cynicism didn\u2019t put a man on the moon. Cynicism has never ended a war, or cured disease, or built a business, or taught a young mind. Cynicism is a choice that you make. And it\u2019s being fed to you all the time. Don\u2019t accept it.\u201d UP FOR GRABS The US midterm elections matter: at stake is control of Congress, the body that writes legislation and holds the budget of the global superpower. While the Republicans are predicted to hold on to their majority in the House of Representatives, the upper house, the Senate, is very much up for grabs. The Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate, but all pollsters agree that they will lose seats. Most expect the Republicans to gain a narrow majority. To secure a majority the Republicans need to pick up six seats: 33 Senate seats are up for election in the normal way. Seats that polls predict Democrats will lose include Montana, West Virginia, South Dakota, Arkansas and Louisiana. In addition, the elections will see 36 of 50 state governorships and thousands of local offices contested."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
