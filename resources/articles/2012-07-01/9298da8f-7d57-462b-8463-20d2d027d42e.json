To feel a modicum of pride in our island nation. By no means am I a monarchist, or a sentimentalist, but by Jove we do know how to celebrate these big occasions (with loads of boats, lashings of bunting and some farmyard animals). Extending that sense of proud Britishness to your wardrobe, though, is extremely thorny. For clues on how not to tackle it, just Google image \"EDL march\". Terrible attitude, terrible clothes. Leaving all that well alone, I was pondering what our \"national dress\" is. Do we have one? I'm certainly not going to advocate wearing \"Beefeater\" get-up \u2013 although those Tudor bonnets are a bit of fun. Perhaps the answer lies with what people from other countries picture when they think of a British person. So I asked an American colleague. This was her response (to be read in an abrasive Detroit drawl): \"I dunno. Tweed, and a hat like a cross between a bowler and a top hat, and a cravat? Or one of those gross stripy blazers that you see at the Henley regatta.\" A little insulting, and fairly unhelpful. I don't think that hat exists anywhere except in her feverish mind. And lovely as they are, it's not really the season to be donning a tweed suit (note: it is never the season to wear a stripy blazer). So I came to the conclusion that the thing to do is try to slyly, or not so slyly, incorporate red, white and blue into your outfit. I have previously considered it impossible to wear anything with a Union Jack emblem without looking like either a tourist or a tosser, or both. I have a particular loathing for Union Jack cufflinks \u2013 they scream \"zany\". But then I happened upon this lovely Gitman Vintage shirt. In spite of it being covered in a swarm of little jacks, it somehow manages to be quite subtle and classy. Warming to the jack, I found myself purchasing the pocket square (left); once folded and in place, it's not immediately recognisable, but a discerning observer (magazine reader) would notice. Obviously the most meaningful way of dressing patriotically is by wearing clothes that are designed, and preferably made, in the UK. There are two drawbacks to this \u2013 first, you need to explain it (\"This shirt? Made in Britain\") and secondly you are likely to pay a premium. However, there are so many great British brands out there, maybe it's worth the money and effort. No, not maybe \u2013 it definitely is. Disclaimer: if you have a Bic-shaved head and/or a tattoo of a bulldog, none of these clothes are for you. Also, why are you reading this? You must be in a waiting room/holding cell.
