While BP continues to jeopardise ecosystems communities and the climate by the reckless pursuit of \"frontier\" oil, cultural institutions like Tate damage their reputation by continuing to be associated with such a destructive corporation. The massive cuts to public arts funding in the UK have left hundreds of culturally important arts organisations in a position of great financial vulnerability, which means that the debate about the appropriateness of particular potential corporate sponsors like BP and Shell is more relevant than ever. As people working in the arts, we believe that corporate sponsorship does not exist in an ethical vacuum. In light of the negative social and ecological impacts of BP around the world, we urge Tate to demonstrate its commitment to a sustainable future by ending its sponsorship relationship with BP.
