Vuk Jeremic said that following the capture last year of the Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, the search for Mladic had intensified and was being run by an international team of intelligence officials in Belgrade. \"This government is absolutely committed, and we have demonstrated our seriousness. All our agencies are working around the clock on this and it is now an international effort,\" Jeremic said in an interview in London. \"A number of partner countries are involved in this effort ... They are actively participating on the ground.\" Jeremic would not say which countries were involved, but both the US and Britain have helped track down Balkan war criminals in the past. Mladic is wanted for genocide for the killing of Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-95 war. His capture is the biggest remaining step to Serbia becoming a candidate member of the European Union. It is hoping to apply for membership this year, but the Netherlands is arguing the application should not be considered until Mladic is handed over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Karadzic, who was Mladic's political boss, was seized by Serbian intelligence last July while riding on a Belgrade bus. He had been living under a false name in the Serbian capital, making a living as a spiritual healer. Jeremic said the network of sympathisers who helped hide Karadzic's identity had been arrested but there was no overlap with those hiding Mladic. \"The two are entirely separate,\" the foreign minister said, adding that Mladic had lost the protection of the Serbian army in 2002 and since then the security services had lost trace of him. Jeremic argued that Serbia was meeting its obligations to Europe by fully cooperating with The Hague. \"That means we are doing everything that is physically possible,\" he said. \"The question is who is going to verify this.\" Serge Brammertz, the prosecutor at The Hague tribunal, is a regular visitor to Belgrade, but Jeremic said there was a need for a EU fact-finding mission that could appreciate the political costs the Serbian government was incurring in pursuing a man who is a hero to many Serb nationalists. He argued the strategic future of the western Balkans should not be held hostage to the capture of a single man, claiming that his government was \"the most pro-European administration in the history of Serbia\". \"The key question is whether we waste the year of 2009. This is the second time the people of Serbia has voted for the European process. It will take another generation to generate the same level of support to move the process forward.\" Dejan Anastasijevic, a Serbian journalist and security expert based in Brussels, said he believed Belgrade was \"doing everything they can to find Mladic\". Anastasijevic said he believed Sasa Vukadinovic, the new head of Serbia's intelligence agency, the BIA, was committed to the hunt for war crimes suspects. \"But even he can't fully control the whole service. He has inherited a lot of cadres dating back from [Slobodan] Milosevic's time. I haven't seen any effort by him to really clear them up. The issue is real control over the security system.\" The genocide charges against Mladic are based on his command of the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted throughout the Bosnian conflict, and the 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys following the fall in 1995 of the enclave of Srebrenica, which was supposed to have been a UN safe haven. Film footage shows him at the scene, reassuring his captives that they are safe. Afterwards they were put on buses to mass execution sites. In another sign of an intensified effort to find the 66-year-old fugitive, European Union peacekeepers in Bosnia have raided homes belonging to other members of the Mladic family. Serbia's police minister, Ivica Dacic, said last month that the BIA was cooperating with foreign intelligence agencies but denied that involved active cooperation with agents on Serbian territory. Hague investigators are pushing Serbia to find another war crimes suspect, Goran Hadzic, wanted for the murder of Croats between 1991 and 1993. The former Hague prosecutor Carla del Ponte claimed in a recent book that the CIA had promised to help in the hunt for Serb war criminals but had in fact impeded her efforts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
