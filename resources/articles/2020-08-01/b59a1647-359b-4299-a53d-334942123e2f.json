Under the proposals, unveiled on Thursday, planning applications based on pre-approved \u201cdesign codes\u201d would get an automatic green light \u2013 eliminating a whole stage of local oversight within designated zones. Land across England would be divided into three categories \u2013 for growth, renewal or protection \u2013 under what Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, described as \u201conce in a generation\u201d changes to sweep away an outdated planning system and boost building. New homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices would be allowed automatically in \u201cgrowth\u201d areas. In \u201crenewal\u201d zones, largely urban and brownfield sites, proposals would be given \u201cpermission in principle\u201d subject to basic checks. Green belt and areas of outstanding natural beauty would be protected. While the proposed changes are likely to appeal to developers, they prompted stinging criticism from housing charities, planning officers and architects who warned of a new generation of fast and substandard housing. The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) condemned them as disruptive and rushed, saying 90% of planning applications are currently approved but there are up to 1m unbuilt permissions. Labour called it \u201ca developers\u2019 charter\u201d that will \u201cset fire to important safeguards\u201d. The long-awaited government white paper touts a new streamlined process designed to reduce red tape and harness technology to deliver homes more rapidly, ministers said. Government sources insisted there would be no dilution in building standards. Changes out for consultation under the white paper also include: Requiring local housing plans to be developed and agreed in 30 months, down from the current seven years. Extending the current exemption of small sites from having to make \u201csection 106\u201d payments \u2013 the means by which developers are forced to provide affordable housing. Ensuring that all new homes are carbon-neutral by 2050. At the weekend, Jenrick said the new regime drew inspiration from \u201cdesign codes and pattern books\u201d used in the construction of Bath, Belgravia and Bournville. But the prospect of a modern-day application and use of such codes to give developers \u201cpermission in principle\u201d in zones categorised as being for growth was greeted with alarm in some quarters. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) described the proposals as \u201cshameful\u201d and said they would do \u201calmost nothing to guarantee the delivery of affordable, well-designed and sustainable homes\u201d. \u201cWhile they might help to \u2018get Britain building\u2019 \u2013 paired with the extension of permitted development rights last week \u2013 there\u2019s every chance they could also lead to the development of the next generation of slum housing,\u201d said RIBA president Alan Jones. Proposals to extend the current exemption of small sites from having to make section 106 payments were slated as a way of helping smaller developers bounce back from the economic impact of the pandemic. But Shelter said social housing \u201ccould face extinction\u201d if the requirement for developers to build their fair share was removed. \u201cSection 106 agreements between developers and councils are tragically one of the only ways we get social homes built these days, due to a lack of direct government investment,\u201d said its chief executive, Polly Neate. \u201cSo, it makes no sense to remove this route to genuinely affordable homes without a guaranteed alternative.\u201d The proposals contain scant detail on any alternative way to boost the number of affordable homes, promising only that they will not decrease. The white paper proposes a consultation on developers making in-kind payments of affordable homes toward the levy or allowing local authorities to buy a proportion of affordable housing at a discounted rate. Hugh Ellis, director of policy at TCPA, criticised the changes overall, saying: \u201cThis kind of disruptive reform doesn\u2019t suit anybody, neither landowners nor developers. They\u2019re turning the system on its head at a time when it\u2019s working very well for the volume house builders \u2013 90% of planning applications are approved and there are about a million unbuilt permissions.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s about local democracy. When local people are walking down the street and come across a new development they didn\u2019t know about, the answer will now be: \u2018You should have been involved in the consultation eight years ago when the code was agreed.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s diluting the democratic process. At the moment, people get two chances to be involved: once when the plan is made, and once when a planning application is submitted. Now they\u2019ll only have a chance when the code is being prepared.\u201d Zack Simons, a planning barrister at Landmark chambers, said there was a lot to welcome in a move towards digitising the planning system but added that \u201cliterally nothing\u201d trailed in Jenrick\u2019s public statements could not already be achieved under the current planning system. \u201cPromises of \u201cradical reform\u201d can grab headlines. But remember that of more than 400,000 planning applications which are determined every year, over 80% are granted permission and under 0.5% are appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.\u201d A government source said it was misleading to suggest planning rules were not an obstacle to building. \u201cThe [90%] approval statistic masks the numbers of people who are put off applying altogether because of how bureaucratic and difficult this is,\u201d the source said. However, little has been announced on what measures, if any, will be taken against developers who do not use the permission they have been granted. The white paper takes aim at the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, which has acted as the basis for planning since it was passed by the Labour government of Clement Attlee. A \u201ccomplex\u201d planning system has acted as a barrier to building the homes people need, said Jenrick. \u201cWe will cut red tape, but not standards, placing a higher regard on quality, design and the environment than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cPlanning decisions will be simple and transparent, with local democracy at the heart of the process. As we face the economic effects of the pandemic, now is the time for decisive action and a clear plan for jobs and growth.\u201d The Conservatives will hope the overhaul will be favoured not only by investors and developers, but also by the younger voters currently outside its reach. The Tory manifesto commits the government to 300,000 new homes built every year and, before coronavirus hit, senior Tories saw housing as the key mission of the government as a way of targeting a primary concern of many under-40s and city-dwelling voters shut out of the housing market \u2013 those most likely to vote Labour. \u201cWe are seeing a huge generation divide on housing,\u201d one Tory source said. \u201cThe under-40s may have half as much chance of owning a home. That is being directly addressed by the first homes programme but the broader point is this planning system has held back homes being built on land that is ready to be built on. \u201cAnd we know the main concerns which local people may have are about good design, environmentally friendly, buildings that fit into the architectural landscape, ones people are proud to own. We are not cutting any building standards.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
