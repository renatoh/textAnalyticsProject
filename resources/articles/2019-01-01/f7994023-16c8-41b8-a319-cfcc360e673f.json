He intends to make a number of changes for Monday\u2019s FA Cup tie at Wolves but is confident that after that it will be league business as usual. \u201cAll the boys in the squad are pretty experienced at dealing with defeat,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few of them before. This was just our first in the league and we actually played quite well at the Etihad. I don\u2019t think we need to feel insecure about losing 2-1. \u201cWe gave City a good game and it was a very tight game. We were unlucky at times but that\u2019s absolutely OK because when City came to Anfield they missed a late penalty. That could have been a defeat for us right back in October but it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Klopp actually feels that by some measures Liverpool did better against City in defeat than they did on the occasions last season when they won. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with going down narrowly at the Etihad,\u201d he said. \u201cI regard that as the most difficult place in England to go and get a result and this time the margins were so fine that I would say the game was shared roughly 50-50. \u201cIn the past, even when we have won, it\u2019s been more like 60-40 in City\u2019s favour. Even when we beat them 3-0 in the Champions League last season City still had a lot of the game, we were under pressure for long periods and the reason we won was that we were quite clinical in taking our chances. \u201cThe last game was different from all the others we have played against City; there were two teams matching each other and I think that shows how much we have improved. My assessment of the game was positive \u2013 not of the result but of the game. It was not perfect because we lost but you can\u2019t always expect perfection and we lost by the smallest difference you can get, so there\u2019s no need to make a big fuss of it.\u201d Liverpool are away to Brighton next in the Premier League, a game Klopp is fully aware might be tricky based on the home team\u2019s form, but before that there is Wolves and a welcome respite from the intensity of the league programme over the holiday period. Simon Mignolet will get a game in goal, there will most likely be starts for Naby Ke\u00efta and Adam Lallana, and Klopp says he will have no problem at all in calling on Alberto Moreno, the left-back who went public at the end of last year with his dissatisfaction over a lack of game time. \u201cI understand Alberto\u2019s position, he has been unbelievably professional and he is a really important part of the dressing room,\u201d the manager said. Nonetheless Liverpool have just sold Dominic Solanke to Bournemouth and allowed Nathaniel Clyne to join the same club on loan in recognition of the fact that players in their peak years need to be playing. \u201cFootball is a business and we received a good offer for Dominic but you also have to think about people and their situations,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHaving people in reserve is a great option for a manager but Nat Clyne, for instance, is at that age where he has to be playing. He asked me if he could go and I thought about it and said yes, because no one wants to block a career. You can always keep hold of a player but keeping him in the right shape and level of confidence is not so easy if he is not playing many games. Nat was out for a while injured and, when he came back, the situation had moved on. It\u2019s a shame but that\u2019s football; it\u2019s the way things are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
