Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America\u2019s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV\u2019s biggest talked about gay star? Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show\u2019s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B live-tweeted her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (n\u00e9 Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a forthcoming scripted miniseries. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described \u201credneck\u201d queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He\u2019s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the \u201cgay best friend\u201d cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero. \u201cIt\u2019s possible people need a really flawed person to humanize right now,\u201d says Matt Brim, professor and author of Poor Queer Studies. Brim says the love for Joe might be more complicated than it immediately appears to be. \u201cWhat is the calculus here? For some viewers, Joe Exotic\u2019s rural white queer class identity may be his flaw, so that looking past or accepting it signals tolerance, that most passive-aggressive of power plays. For other viewers, those same qualities \u2013 in their specific and unwieldy combination \u2013 may represent the very soup of our common dilemma. One thing\u2019s for sure: we\u2019re not in South Bend any more,\u201d he said, referring to the city where the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was mayor. Joe belongs to a rural, Republican-voting, working-class background, which makes for great TV for those who have a superficial understanding of the south. Joe appears to be keenly aware of this fact, playing into the shock value of his queer, southern life. Before Tiger King, he pitched multiple reality shows about his life to networks and starred in country music videos with his husbands. He is the perfect kind of reality star \u2013 straddling the line between an unrestrained \u201cbig\u201d personality and a caricature. Joe\u2019s queerness and southern-ness intersect in distinct, complex ways. This includes his use of meth, a popular gay recreational drug. (In 2018, Oklahoma, site of Joe\u2019s zoo, was listed as having one of the highest rates of meth use in the US.) He goes out of his way to associate with traditional ideas of masculinity through his love for guns, collection of large, aggressive animals, and pursuit of young, butch men who have previous histories of only dating women. In the show, Joe says he fell in love with tigers while recovering from a suicide attempt he linked to his parents\u2019 homophobia. Did Joe decide the best way to reconcile his queerness with his surroundings was to assimilate in the most extreme ways \u2013 leaning into the love for hunting and control over wildlife that dominates southern culture? Then he cultivated this assimilation and it grew into a profitable persona. Joe made it so that the most outrageous thing about him in Oklahoma was neither his queerness or poly relationships. It was his tigers. Despite his progressive lifestyle, Joe himself is not a progressive. He believes in unregulated gun rights and, during his bizarre, far-fetched run for governor of Oklahoma, positioned himself as a libertarian. A viral video shows him pondering why black people can say the N-word but white people can\u2019t. However, his queerness complicates this otherwise predictable ideology. At his wedding, we see Joe and his two husbands dressed in fuschia western shirts \u2013 none of the elements feel coherent or like they belong together. Since its legalization in 2015, same-sex marriage no longer possesses the same air of radicalism and defiance. But a polyamorous one? Even the progressives in Brooklyn might bat a lash at that. In Tiger King, Joe presents a less than perfect view of himself \u2013 from his meth use to nasty spats with co-workers to his tragic, failed marriages to allegedly straight men. But, in many ways, Joe\u2019s imperfections (and criminal convictions) are what make him feel like a breakthrough for queer representation. Because \u201cperfect\u201d is so 1998. However, there is the danger we are collectively laughing at Joe and his rural background, instead of laughing with him. In a post, the runner of the popular Instagram account QueerAppalachia expressed concerns over Joe\u2019s popularity, writing: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about why Joe is a joke to everyone, even to the folks that understand the nuanced history &amp; economics that brought him into existence as a rural queer\u2026 [Joe Exotic] is more than just another #hillbillyjoke, so much of his story is about class &amp; access.\u201d Representation of queerness in red states has always been sparse and complicated. The portrayals often face accusations of being exploitative or overly simplistic. A recent one was John B McLemore of the hit podcast series S-Town. McLemore was a queer horologist living in Woodstock, Alabama, a small, conservative place he hated. Critics called the podcast \u201cvoyeuristic\u201d and irresponsible for outing McLemore after his death. Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye occasionally chooses LGBTQ+ subjects living in conservative locales for its transformations, and the show\u2019s format \u2013 \u201cfix all your problems in an hour\u201d with a group of affluent, pro-consumption coastal gay men \u2013 has drawn scrutiny. Does the novelty of a complicated figure such as Joe Exotic expose our preferences for coastal queer narratives? \u201cYes,\u201d says John Howard, professor and author of Men Like That: A Southern Queer History. \u201cFor 25 years, scholars have criticized a bicoastal bias in US queer history that has focused attention on east and west coast metropolitan areas. But this is changing.\u201d Howard points to the conversations Tiger King is producing. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the public debate expands. Perhaps we\u2019ll learn more about working-class queers and trans people of color who, as yet, remain at the margins of Joe\u2019s narrative.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
