The latest opinion poll shows big Fred leaking support, slumping from 27% among Republicans nationally in September down to 19% this month. And then the latest official fundraising and spending numbers were published, showing Thompson with just $7m in the bank, several million dollars less than Giuliani or Romney. Even Ron Paul has $5m in hand. Unless he starts doing something soon, Fred's toast. Still, he can spend more time with his charming wife."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
