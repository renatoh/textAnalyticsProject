As part of attempts to win over Brexit-supporting ministers, Smith struck a pessimistic note on Tuesday about the parliamentary arithmetic, the Guardian understands. He suggested the most likely outcome if the deal were rejected again would be that MPs opt to take a no-deal Brexit off the table and extend article 50. A softer Brexit would then emerge as the majority view in parliament, through a process of \u201cindicative votes\u201d. The prime minister will announce a package of measures designed to safeguard workers\u2019 rights on Wednesday as part of a last-ditch attempt to boost support for her deal and she is likely to fly to Brussels for talks before next week\u2019s vote. The workers\u2019 rights pledges are aimed at winning over Labour MPs in Brexit-backing areas and followed the announcement on Monday of a \u00a31.6bn fund for left-behind towns. As well as promising votes on improvements to workers\u2019 rights initiated by the EU, including two directives already in train, the government is pledging to consult trade unions and businesses on future workers\u2019 rights proposals and create a single enforcement body for vulnerable workers. However, trade unions dismissed the promises, with the TUC calling them \u201cflimsy\u201d. Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cHot on the heels of their pathetic bribe for left-behind towns, here comes the government\u2019s attempt to bribe workers to back their botched Brexit deal. \u201cInstead of automatically keeping up with European workers\u2019 rights, and using that as a floor as Labour has pledged, the government is admitting that British workers could see their rights fall behind those of colleagues in Europe. This is utterly unacceptable.\u201d While it woos Labour MPs, Downing Street is also racing to secure clarifications over the status of the Irish backstop to placate the Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG), which has established a \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyers to examine any changes the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, can secure in last-ditch talks over the next few days. Even if the deal were approved next week, cabinet ministers believe a short, \u201ctechnical\u201d extension of a few weeks would be needed to pass the necessary legislation. But one senior Tory source said: \u201cIf we go for an extension of longer than a technical one, it will be long and it will lead to a softer Brexit.\u201d May has promised MPs an opportunity to reject a no-deal Brexit next week and is coming under growing pressure not to whip MPs in the crucial vote, which was secured after dozens of frontbenchers made clear they were prepared to resign. Downing Street hopes the threat of a softer Brexit \u2013 including a customs union \u2013 will help to win over wavering Brexiters at the meaningful vote, which she has promised to hold by next Tuesday. The long-delayed report stage of the trade bill \u2013 a key piece of Brexit legislation \u2013 is due to begin in the House of Lords on Wednesday, when a crossbench band of peers plan to reopen the issue of a customs union. Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, the shadow international trade minister, said: \u201cIt is surely time for ministers to abandon their red lines and for the government to back this proposal.\u201d He added that if the amendment was passed, it would \u201cgive MPs an opportunity to think again about this crucial issue\u201d when the legislation returned to the House of Commons, likely to be in late March, shortly before Britain is due to leave the EU. That could give the House of Commons an opportunity to force the government\u2019s hand if May\u2019s deal has been rejected a second time by then. \u201cIt\u2019s both a message \u2013 and a mechanism,\u201d said one Labour source. Supporters of the amendment include the former Tory pensions minister Lady Altmann and the crossbencher Lord Kerr. Conservative MPs sounded negative on Tuesday about the prospect of May passing her deal, with one member of the government saying that No 10 appeared to be \u201cin denial\u201d about the parliamentary maths. Another minister said it looked extremely unlikely that the deal would get through this time, unless the Democratic Unionist party buckled and took other Eurosceptics with them. Cox visited Brussels on Tuesday to discuss the hoped for \u201clegally-binding\u201d changes to the Irish backstop demanded by Brexiters. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said: \u201cWe are working at pace to secure the changes we need.\u201d Asked whether the talks would be concluded in time for MPs to scrutinise any new legal text thoroughly, she added: \u201cThey will take as long as they need to take. They are obviously at a critical stage of the negotiations.\u201d The prime minister spoke to the Romanian president on Tuesday, and Downing Street said she would continue to consult with EU leaders throughout the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
