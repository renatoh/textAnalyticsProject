As the board flashed it became clear the player coming off was not, as expected, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, the Premier League\u2019s most overworked attacking whirl, a man who has been cheerfully buzzing his way through the dreaded \u201cred zone\u201d for the last two months, and who has now played 90 minutes seven times in four different countries in the last seven weeks. Instead it was Olivier Giroud who departed. S\u00e1nchez, who had already scored one and made one, took his place up front. There are players who might have let the throttle drop at this point. Other players. Within 90 seconds S\u00e1nchez, an incorrigible blur throughout, had sprinted 40 yards to score Arsenal\u2019s third with a thrilling thumped finish. Ten minutes later he was careering in wildly off the left flank like a drop of fat fizzing around a hot plate and screaming for a penalty as he was bundled over. When you\u2019re Alexis S\u00e1nchez there is a time to rest. And that time is never now. On a night when Arsenal\u2019s hopes of progressing from Champions League Group F narrowed to an intriguing final act in Piraeus two weeks from now, it seemed fitting S\u00e1nchez should lead from the front. The Chilean is in his own way the least Arsenal of Arsenal players, a guaranteed source of thrust and energy irrespective of opponent or occasion. To borrow a phrase from Shane Warne, S\u00e1nchez hasn\u2019t played 70 matches for Arsenal. He has instead played the same match 70 times, and in the most flattering sense. For Wenger he must be a managerial dream, the closest thing to a constant in a sport racked with variables. Arsenal now have their fate in their own hands, but their supporters will be just as encouraged by the broader evidence of attacking rhythm and pep. Before kick-off there was a tinny kind of tension around the Emirates, that familiar disjunct whenever any football match has its outcome bound up in events elsewhere. For a while the first half was as low-key as a must-win Champions League game in front of a (technically) full house is ever likely to get. Arsenal passed and probed politely. Zagreb are game but limited opponents. They really shouldn\u2019t have come this close to eliminating from the Champions League the eighth richest club in the world. Here they ran and hustled well enough early on. At which point Arsenal\u2019s high-spec attacking parts began to take the game away. S\u00e1nchez had started wide on the left, with Mesut \u00d6zil in full meandering maestro mode in the centre. As he often does in the opening minutes of these European nights \u2013 like a chess player enjoying the neat, square lie of the pieces \u2013 \u00d6zil provided an early flicker of jaw\u2011dropping vision, yawning a lovely little reverse pass inside Alexandru Matel from a flashy angle. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s first act was to fall over attempting a jump-start dribble just outside the area. His second was a lofted pass towards Giroud that brought a corner. For a while he buzzed on the fringes, kitted out in an oversized pair of black gloves that emphasised the way he almost seems to be paddling the ground with his hands as he runs. It seemed inevitable the opening goal would involve \u00d6zil, and he duly scored it, stooping to head past Eduardo. It was a fine breakaway goal, made by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s burst down the right and floated cross and finished by Arsenal\u2019s record signing and \u2013 for some time now \u2013 best player. It was S\u00e1nchez\u2019s fourth direct assist in this season\u2019s Champions League. His own first goal followed shortly afterwards. Nacho Monreal stole the ball and slipped it inside for S\u00e1nchez, hurtling into space, to tuck it with almost disdainful haste past Eduardo. Despite all those recent minutes racked up it was his first goal in eight games for club and country, having previously come off a run of 10 in six. Not that a barren S\u00e1nchez spell ever really feels like cause for concern, such is his very obvious love of playing, of just keeping on keeping on. S\u00e1nchez may have walked a bit more of late in between those throttle\u2011thrumming impact runs. In fact his combined yardage stats are quite measured. But in a season that started in June \u2013 with a month off post\u2011Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2013 he has now played 30 matches, had 109 shots at goal, been fouled 67 times and embarked on an unquantifiable number of furious, vengeful, arm-waggling, sprints. Carry on Alexis. Bravo. More. There was more, too, as S\u00e1nchez and \u00d6zil continued to decorate what had by now become a distinctly zombified occasion. Arsenal are still alive in the Champions League, albeit despite their own best efforts in losing those opening two fixtures. They have a fair chance now of winning in Greece, maybe even winning well enough to creep through to the knockout rounds, thanks in large part to the enduring spirit of their most indefatigable presence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
