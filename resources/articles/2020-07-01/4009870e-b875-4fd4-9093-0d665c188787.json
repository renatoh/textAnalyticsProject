Residents in more than a dozen states recently reported receiving seed packets they did not order that appeared to have been sent by mail from China. The US Department of Agriculture said it is working with the Customs and Border Protection, other federal agencies, and the state department to investigate the situation. The department is urging US residents to report the suspicious packages and not plant the seeds. But it it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any evidence indicating this is something other than a \u2018brushing scam\u2019 where people receive unsolicited items from a seller who then posts false customer reviews to boost sales\u201d. In Kentucky, the state agriculture department was notified that several residents had received the packages, the agriculture commissioner, Ryan Quarles, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they are, and we cannot risk any harm whatsoever to agricultural production in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the safest, most abundant food supply in the world and we need to keep it that way.\u201d \u201cAt this point in time, we don\u2019t have enough information to know if this is a hoax, a prank, an internet scam or an act of agricultural bio-terrorism,\u201d Quarles added. \u201cUnsolicited seeds could be invasive and introduce unknown diseases to local plants, harm livestock or threaten our environment.\u201d In North Carolina, the department of agriculture and consumer services said it was contacted by numerous people who received seed shipments they did not order. The agency said the shipments were likely the product of \u2018brushing\u2019. \u201cAccording to the Better Business Bureau, foreign, third-party sellers use your address and Amazon information to generate a fake sale and positive review to boost their product ratings,\u201d said Phil Wilson, director of the state\u2019s plant industry division. And Florida\u2019s agriculture and consumer services commissioner, Nikki Fried, said on Twitter on Tuesday that the state had received more than 600 reports of suspicious seed packages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
