The Travel Advice Unit say that there is significant lawlessness throughout the country and that robberies, kidnapping and carjacking are commons and can occur anywhere. Victims risk being murdered even if they do not resist their attackers. Downtown San Salvador is to be avoided at all times and travel outside the city after dark is not a good idea. Oh, and don't wear jewellery or carry cash, either. But the unit does say that business travellers who are met at the airport and are accompanied during their trip by a local representative tend to have fewer problems. So that's all right then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
