New research shows that by 2033 every hospital trust will have 10-20 fewer consultant anaesthetists than they will need to meet rising patient demand. It estimates that, while the NHS has agreed that its total of anaesthetists should expand to 11,800 by that date, on current trends it is likely to reach only 8,000 \u2013 a shortfall of 3,800, or about 33%. Anaesthetists play a vital role in preparing patients for surgery and monitoring them, are key members of the medical teams in maternity units and intensive care, and deliver pain relief and resuscitation. They become involved in the treatment of two-thirds of hospital inpatients. Like many other areas of medical care, anaesthesia already has too few practitioners. Rota gaps \u2013 where there are too few doctors to cover every shift in hospital units \u2013 are increasingly common. The Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA), which carried out the research, warned that patients and the smooth running of hospitals would be hit if the existing shortfallin numbers was allowed to increase. Dr Liam Brennan, the college\u2019s president, said: \u201cAnaesthetists possess a unique and non-transferable skill set that is essential to maintaining core hospital services, so the potential impact of a reduced anaesthetic workforce would have serious implications for patient safety across the whole NHS. We already have fewer than we need and the shortages are worrying.\u201d The college\u2019s latest census of the UK\u2019s anaesthesia workforce, the first since 2010, also found that 74% of hospitals already rely on locum anaesthetists hired from medical employment agencies to ensure their rotas are full. The cost of that is part of the NHS\u2019s huge annual bill \u2013 \u00a33.7bn a year in England alone \u2013 for temporary staff. Brennan said the outlay on locums showed that the shortfall in anaesthetists was a false economy. Even more anaesthetic departments \u2013 98% \u2013 needed their own staff to do extra shifts as internal locums to avoid rota gaps. The report\u2019s findings were \u201cvery worrying\u201d, said Brennan. \u201cThese shortages mean that doctors who are already overstretched are having to work even harder to maintain services, particularly for urgent and emergency care for patients. They are going the extra mile on a daily basis to fill these gaps. \u201cPart of the picture is that there are no other doctors that can do our jobs, therefore there\u2019s no potential for cross-cover, because the skills we have aren\u2019t part of the generic skill set of doctors.\u201d Tight NHS budgets and hospitals\u2019 need to make efficiency savings meant there was not enough money to hire the number of anaesthetists needed, he added. \u201cIf consultant anaesthetists are continually having to \u2018act down\u2019 and fill gaps in rotas, then they are less available during the day, so there will inevitably be delays to people needing elective care, such as hip operations and the like. Is this situation sustainable? I don\u2019t think it is,\u201d said Brennan. A report last year by the Centre for Workforce Intelligence, which is part of the NHS staffing agency Health Education England, said that demand for anaesthetic services would grow by 25% by 2033 because of the ageing and growing population. That would require the number of anaesthetists to grow by 300 a year to keep up. But the royal college\u2019s findings show that only 130 more a year were added between 2007 and 2015, leading to a significant gap that on current trends is set to continue widening. Brennan urged NHS planners to create more training places for young doctors seeking to make a career in anaesthetics in order to minimise the expected shortfall. The time-sensitive nature of what anaesthetists do made adequate numbers essential, added Brennan. \u201cIf we delay even for a few minutes intubating a patient who needs intubation, that patient might well die,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, warned patients could be hit by the shortages the college\u2019s research uncovered. \u201cAnaesthetists are absolutely essential to the delivery of many hospital services \u2013 and staff shortages of this kind present a serious risk to patient care. Ministers can\u2019t keep turning a blind eye to this crisis. Unless urgent action is taken the people who will suffer most will be patients,\u201d she said. The Department of Health said: \u201cWe don\u2019t recognise the RCoA figures. Anaesthetists play a vital role in the NHS, so it\u2019s important we have an appropriate number available across the week. Since 2010 we have almost 900 additional anaesthetists in the NHS, an increase of more than 16%, with more than 3,000 in training posts every year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
