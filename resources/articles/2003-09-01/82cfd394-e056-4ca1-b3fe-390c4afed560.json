But this time, they have Alex Murphy, back from a holiday in France for his fifth coaching stint with the club, to help them clear the final hurdle against Salford next week. \"There's no magic wands in this game,\" a well-tanned Murphy said after this cruise against an indisciplined Hull Kingston Rovers yesterday, and although the 64-year-old's status in Leigh is such that some supporters probably think he walked back across the Channel, he is putting his faith in a higher authority. \"There's a few of our lads will be going to midnight mass this week,\" he added, referring to two players who face a disciplinary hearing tomorrow and several more who picked up injuries yesterday. Of the crocks, Tommy Martyn is the biggest worry, as the former St Helens half-back represents Leigh's best chance of claiming their first win against Salford in six attempts this season. After providing a few classy touches and even the odd important tackle in the first half, Martyn was confined to the bench with a dead leg, and Murphy describe his grand final chances as \"touch and go\". Leigh actually ended the game with 12 men, after the hard-working second-row Sean Richardson was forced off with concussion to join Martyn, Neil Turley, Sonny Nickle and Danny Halliwell, who had spent most of the second half vomiting in a corner of the gym, a fact helpfully pointed out by Murphy. But the man they would miss most next Sunday is Paul Rowley. The former Halifax hooker, a member of England's 1995 World Cup squad, was a constant threat from acting half, but like Ricky Bibey, the former Wigan forward who will join St Helens next season, he was sent off in Leigh's 28-18 defeat at Salford in last weekend's qualifying semi-final. Unfortunately for Leigh, all who have seen his late tackle on Gavin Clinch are expecting him to be banned. Rowley's probing set up early tries for Halliwell and the former Leeds wing Leroy Rivett, and although Paul Mansson replied with a classy individual score, by half-time Leigh were 32-4 ahead after further touchdowns from Rivett, Pat Weisner and Dave Bradbury. When they stopped conceding penalties after the break, Rovers showed the ability that had brought them consecutive wins over Salford, Oldham and Rochdale with well-worked tries for Alasdair McClarron and Paul Parker. But even with 12 men Leigh had the final word when Rivett sent Damian Munro between the posts for their sixth try. \u00b7 Keighley Cougars will play Sheffield Eagles in the National League Two grand final, also at Widnes next Sunday, after winning 45-12 at Chorley yesterday.
