Madonna recently quit her lifelong record label, Warner, in favour of a deal with concert promoter Live Nation, while Prince gave his latest album away, and there are a string of new websites that aim to cut label bosses out of the equation and hand more power to the musicians and their fans. But UK singer-songwriter Mark Joseph believes that not only do record labels have a future, they can also represent a good investment opportunity for music lovers. With help from his fans, Joseph has set up his own label, 38 Records, to market his music and other acts he intends to sign up. So far, more than 100 people have between them invested a total of just over \u00a3750,000 in the label. The target figure is \u00a32m. Individual investments have ranged from \u00a31,000 to \u00a3100,000, and there is a real mix of investors, from headteachers, hospital workers and accountants to childminders, students and builders. They now own a stake in the label that is related to the size of their investment, though Joseph holds the controlling stake in the business. The \"shareholders\" will receive their initial investment back once an agreed (confidential) number of albums have been sold, and they will then continue to receive annual dividends based on the label's performance, though Joseph, perhaps understandably, was reluctant to go into detail on this. In addition to any financial benefits, investors also get the chance to work closely with an artist they believe in and whose music they like. All the shareholders are fans of Joseph, and many have already been to the studio to see him recording his new album. \"That's one of the things I love about the concept - we could offer it to anyone, as opposed to having to get people on board that were 'cold investors' purely involved from a monetary point of view,\" says Joseph, who was dubbed \"the boy who beat the biz\" by one newspaper. Back in 2002, Joseph embarked on a huge touring campaign that saw him playing anywhere that would have him - from schools and colleges to pubs and clubs. This built up his fanbase, and the following year he scored a top 40 hit with his first single, Get Through, which he released on his own DIY label (it reached number 38). His next single, Fly, got to number 28, and by this point he was starting to get some serious interest from major labels. He signed a deal with Warner and enjoyed another two top 40 singles, though he says the whole experience opened his eyes to the good and the not so good aspects of being on a major label. They then parted company, and Joseph decided to set up a new independent label. But the first question that confronted him was: \"How am I going to fund this label?\" He had big dreams of string sections and the like, and wasn't interested in setting up some sort of low-budget underground indie label. That is when he hit on the idea of creating a fun-funded venture. He initially approached a handful of people who regularly came to his gigs, \"and they bit our hands off\". During the past few months, Joseph has been busy with the label and working on his second album, Sold to Sound, with top British producer Andy Green, best-known for his work with Brit rockers Keane and KT Tunstall. Mark's own music, which he categorises as \"pop-rock,\" has been compared to Oasis, the Kinks and Paul Weller. He recently signed another artist to the label, Katie Buckhaven, a singer-songwriter championed by Michael Parkinson. She has just started recording her new album, which, like Sold to Sound, is due for release next year. Mark's aim is to get other bands on board too. He accepts that, for many of the label's shareholders, over \u00a31,000 is \"a lot of money\". He adds: \"They look at it as an opportunity for being involved in an exciting record label. If we are doing really well, then, yes, everyone will make money out of it. People are happy to take the risk - everyone's really excited about it.\" For more information, go to 38records.co.uk r.jones@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
