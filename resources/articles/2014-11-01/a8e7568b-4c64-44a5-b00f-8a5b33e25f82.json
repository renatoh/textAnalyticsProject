The 19-year-old forward, who scored a fine goal for Belgium against Iceland on Wednesday, joined Liverpool from Lille in the summer for \u00a39.8m with the transfer dependent on him remaining with the French club on loan this season. Origi has stayed in regular contact with Brendan Rodgers and, with Liverpool struggling in front of goal, has raised the prospect of increasing the manager\u2019s options in the next transfer window. A premature move would suit both Origi and Liverpool, who are believed to be willing to pay extra to bring the transfer forward to January. However, the striker admits Lille need to agree to break the original deal and Liverpool have had no encouragement that could happen. He said: \u201cMaybe January, who knows? It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go. I would like to join Liverpool then. I said that I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course, but if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say that I would not like to go to Liverpool in January. \u201cBrendan Rodgers is in contact regularly. That makes me feel very good and wanted. And although I agreed to stay with Lille until the end of this season, if there was a chance of joining Liverpool sooner I would take it. \u201cI would love to move to Liverpool sooner rather than later. I am here at Lille, it is fine, they are a good club and they have helped me. But it is also frustrating. It is French football. I can\u2019t wait to be playing in the Premier League because I can now see that it will suit me better.\u201d Origi, who was preferred to Romelu Lukaku in Belgium\u2019s final two games at the World Cup in Brazil, has kept a close eye on Liverpool\u2019s problems without Luis Su\u00e1rez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. He added: \u201cThey have a team with a lot of talent, with a lot of good players and a very good coach. But they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them. \u201cIt is difficult when you do not have a player like Daniel Sturridge. I believe they just have to be more efficient but I also believe that it is only a matter of time before it comes.\u201d Sturridge has been sidelined since August with thigh and calf injuries but is expected to return for Liverpool\u2019s next game after the international break at Crystal Palace on Sunday 23 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
