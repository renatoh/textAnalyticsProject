Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a rundown of the main events to have occurred since our last summary: The prime minister has decided to hold a Cobra meeting to discuss the flooding that his large parts of the Midlands and northern England. That came after Jeremy Corbyn urged him to take such action, suggesting the crisis would have been taken more seriously had it occurred in the south east. A former ally of Boris Johnson launched a stinging attack on the prime minister and the opposition leader. Nick Boles said the UK faced a \u201cappalling choice\u201d between the leaders of the two main parties at next month\u2019s election. For a comprehensive summary of the day\u2019s earlier news. See this excellent post from my colleague, Andrew Sparrow. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Kate Proctor, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart have our main story: The Lib Dems have \u201cimmediately opened disciplinary investigations\u201d into tweets that appear to have been posted by Kevin McNamara, the party\u2019s candidate for Thurrock. A serious of screenshots purporting to show tweets from his account appeared on social media this evening. The account has now been locked and tweets are no longer visible to people not following it. Nigel Farage is facing calls from Brexit supporters to stand down further candidates to help Boris Johnson after he made a dramatic public U-turn by agreeing to withdraw his party from all Conservative-held seats, my colleagues Kate Proctor, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart write. The Brexit party leader claimed he had changed his mind about fielding candidates in 317 seats held by the Tories after Johnson released a video pledging to take Britain out of the EU by 2020 and to pursue a Canada-style trade deal. The abrupt nature of Farage\u2019s reversal prompted claims from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP that he and Johnson had struck a secret pact in favour of a hard Brexit, which both sides denied. Farage admitted he had been offered a peerage by the Tories as recently as last Friday but claimed he had turned this down. Senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for Farage to make further concessions and stand back in Labour-held target seats, after Farage conceded that the presence of his party in those contests could lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum. Farage claimed he now had more \u201coptimism\u201d about Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal after the prime minister\u2019s clarifications, having previously condemned it as a \u201csellout\u201d and not a real Brexit. I have got no great love for the Conservative party at all, but I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance \u2026 and stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats \u2013 they even want to revoke the result of the referendum \u2013 I think our action, our announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening. A former aide to Boris Johnson is facing calls to stand down as an election candidate after Labour accused him of \u201cdisgusting racism\u201d over some of his writings that blame immigrants for bringing germs and HIV to the UK and accuse Muslims of having divided loyalties. Labour called on the prime minister to personally intervene to stop Anthony Browne from contesting the seat of South Cambridgeshire, saying his writings from 2002 and 2003 were \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cdespicable\u201d. In an article for the Spectator, Browne wrote: It is not through letting in terrorists that the government\u2019s policy of mass migration \u2013 especially from the third world \u2013 will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs. After the Cobra meeting was announced, a Labour spokesman said If these floods had happened in Surrey, this would have happened five days ago. The prime minister will chair a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government\u2019s response to recent flooding, Downing Street has said. The emergency meeting will be held five days after the flooding hit large parts of northern England and the Midlands. We reported earlier that the Labour leader was urging him to take such action and suggested that, had the flooding occurred in south-eastern England, it\u2019s likely it would have been declared a national emergency (see 6.37pm). The former Conservative MP, Nick Boles, has torn into both his own ex-colleagues and the Labour leadership this evening. Formerly a close ally of Boris Johnson, Boles reserves some of his harshest criticism for the prime minister. In an article for the Evening Standard, he writes: In years to come, it will be known as the Appalling Choice of 2019. It will be cited alongside classical mythology\u2019s Scylla and Charybdis \u2014 the one a six-headed monster and the other a whirlpool \u2014 spelling death and destruction for any passing ship. It will be recorded as the only election in modern times in which you wouldn\u2019t trust either of the prime ministerial candidates to mind your children for an hour, let alone run the country. In the blue corner, we have a compulsive liar who has betrayed every single person he has ever had any dealings with: every woman who has ever loved him, every member of his family, every friend, every colleague, every employee, every constituent. As a senior member of his cabinet once put it to me: \u2018You can always rely on Boris...to let you down\u2019. His bumbling braggadocio disguises an all-consuming ego utterly without conscience, empathy or restraint. In the red corner is a blinkered Pharisee, a man so convinced of his own rectitude that he sees no contradiction between his pious homilies about racism and equality and a lifetime of support for terrorists, murderers and racist thugs. Like all leaders of a totalitarian mindset, he is entirely uninterested in the lives of individual human beings. He cares only for classes and factions, and the struggle between abstract political forces. Boles adds that he would be voting Lib Dem at the upcoming election. Each weekday evening for the duration of the campaign, my colleague Andrew Sparrow will be putting together an election briefing. You can read today\u2019s here: Nigel Farage\u2019s unilateral announcement that he will engage in a one-way electoral pact with the Conservatives will be an undoubted relief to Boris Johnson, but the benefit may be more limited than it first appears. Headline polling data already indicated that the Brexit party was being successfully squeezed by the Tories\u2019 pro-Brexit strategy. Its polling average had slumped from 12% in the third week of October to its current 9%. A former Brexit party candidate is defying Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to step aside in Tory-held seats and will stand as an independent instead. Neil Greaves, from the Harlow constituency in Essex, criticised Farage\u2019s approach: Nigel has let Brexiteers down ... he should be standing up for the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit. I don\u2019t regard Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as Brexit. It\u2019s not even close. Farage has been totally outmanoeuvred and out-negotiated without Boris [Johnson] even having to say anything. He says Boris is going to come out on 20 December \u2013 really? You believe him? The constituency voted 68% to leave in the EU referendum but Robert Halfon, the Conservative candidate who won the seat with a majority of more than 7,000 in 2017, backed remain in the referendum. That led Greaves to claim that his pulling out of the race would mean there \u201cwon\u2019t be a leave option for Harlow\u201d. To do a blanket \u2018oh we\u2019re not going to stand in Tory seats\u2019 is silly, it\u2019s more nuanced than that. There\u2019s a big centre ground open and I thought we would take that but [Farage] has played a particularly bad hand since Boris became Tory leader \u2013 he allied himself too much to the Tories. His fellow former Brexit party candidate, Ruth Jolley, said she \u201crespected\u201d Farage\u2019s decision but was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the people of her South West Norfolk constituency would not be able to vote for a Brexit party candidate. For me, the Brexit party was about more than Brexit; it was a chance to change politics for good and shake up our institutions. The former civil servant, who now runs a pet care business, said she would continue to campaign for Brexit party candidates elsewhere but will not vote in the election. I couldn\u2019t vote for those who are standing in my constituency in all good conscience. I couldn\u2019t vote for Liz Truss (the local Conservative candidate and cabinet minister) because I do think the Tories have negotiated a terrible deal. Over at the Guardian\u2019s general election fact check desk, my colleague Hilary Osborne has had a look at Emily Thornberry\u2019s claim the UK\u2019s armed forces have \u201ceffectively had a pay cut over the last few years\u201d: The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has been seeking to portray the Tories as increasingly in thrall to Nigel Farage after the latter announced that his Brexit party will not stand candidates in Conservative-held seats. We reported earlier that Sturgeon had said that any form of Brexit that would be acceptable to Farage would be bad for Scotland (see 3.45pm). Here\u2019s a little more on those comments: The Brexit party\u2019s announcement today really does underline the fact that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are joined at the hip and, frankly, any form of Brexit that is acceptable to Nigel Farage is going to be deeply damaging for Scotland. I suspect there are many traditional Tory party voters here in Scotland and elsewhere across the UK who will be appalled to learn that their party has effectively become the Brexit party. If you vote Tory, you get the Brexit party and its view of the world and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the vast majority of the people in Scotland want. We see a Tory party becoming ever more extreme and rightwing, and out of touch with the majority of people in Scotland. It really does underline the view that if you don\u2019t take Scotland\u2019s future into Scotland\u2019s hands at this election, then the danger is our future is imposed upon us by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit party, claimed today that he had killed off any prospect of a second referendum after he declared that his party would not stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in 2017. The exact impact of his decision is still a matter of debate, but it is almost certainly the most significant electoral boost the Tories have had in the campaign so far. In a speech in Hartlepool (full text here), Farage claimed that his decision meant a \u201cleave alliance\u201d was now in operation. He said: I have got no great love for the Conservative party at all. But I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance, by keeping him honest and holding him to account by getting people in, and by stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats who\u2019d sign us up to everything, wouldn\u2019t they, the United States of Europe, European army, you name it, I mean they even want to revoke the result of the referendum. No, I think our action, this announcement today prevents a second referendum from happening and that to me I think right now is the single most important thing in our country. So in a sense, we now have a leave alliance. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve done it unilaterally. We\u2019ve decided ourselves that we absolutely have to put country before party and take the fight to Labour. Boris Johnson has claimed that he did not call Farage to agree a leave alliance deal with him. But in his speech Farage claimed that he changed his mind, and decided not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats even though only 10 days ago he said Johnson would have to abandon his whole Brexit plan for this to happen, because of assurances made by Johnson in a video posted on Twitter yesterday afternoon. Farage said: It\u2019s been a difficult decision to make, but I have to say that last night, for the first time I saw something since that Brussels summit that actually was optimistic; because I saw Boris Johnson on a video saying: \u2018We will not extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020\u2019. And that, in many ways, a direct challenge to Mr Barnier [the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator] that would need a change to the political declaration before all of this gets ratified in parliament. Now you may well say to me: isn\u2019t this the same Boris Johnson who said he\u2019d die in a ditch rather than extend from 31 October? And yes, the issue of trust, the issue of delivery is a very real one and I\u2019ll come back to that perhaps in a few moments\u2019 time. But at least it was a clear, unequivocal statement from him, that we\u2019re not going on beyond the end of 2020. But much more significantly \u2013 and really quite unreported on so far today \u2013 he said something else that really did matter to me, hugely. He said we would negotiate a trade deal, a super-Canada-plus trade deal with no political alignment. Now, that is a huge change because ever since Mrs May\u2019s abject speech in Florence, we\u2019ve been aiming at a close and special partnership with the European Union. Johnson\u2019s \u201csuper Canada plus\u201d comment has not been reported today because this sort of trade deal has always been his aim, and there was nothing new in what he was saying yesterday in the video. But it did look as though it had been distributed to give Farage cover for the climbdown he announced today. At the moment Farage is still planning to run candidates in Labour-held seats, which could prevent the Tories from making gains in those constituencies. But given that Farage has now accepted that Johnson\u2019s deal is acceptable, and that a Johnson majority government would be preferable to a hung parliament, it is hard to see the logic of his stance. It remains to be seen if a further retreat is coming. Thursday is the deadline when candidates must decide whether they are or are not standing in constituencies. The opposition parties have said that Farage\u2019s decision confirms that the Conservative party is becoming the Brexit party. Labour (here), the SNP (here) and the Lib Dems (here) have all made this point. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Johnson to declare a national emergency and chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee, Cobra, in response to the flooding in South Yorkshire. Hillary Clinton has called Downing Street\u2019s suppression of a report into potential Russian infiltration of British politics \u201cdamaging, inexplicable and shaming\u201d. A Green party candidate has withdrawn in a second marginal seat targeted by Labour, prompting speculation that more Greens could step aside as part of an informal anti-Conservative alliance not sanctioned by the central party. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, has accused Corbyn of putting Marxist solidarity ahead of democracy after the Labour leader said Evo Morales had been forced to resign as Bolivia\u2019s president due to a military coup. A Labour government would introduce \u201cmanaged migration\u201d for EU nationals in the event Brexit happens, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has said as the party continues to debate what immigration policy to offer at the election. The Conservatives have challenged Labour to explain whether Corbyn would be willing to use nuclear weapons as a last resort after Thornberry refused to answer this question in an interview. Johnson\u2019s government appears to be preparing to nominate an EU commissioner, potentially breaching another Brexit promise after he failed to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline to leave on 31 October. Britain\u2019s economy avoided a recession in the third quarter after it expanded by 0.3% but the annual pace of growth was the slowest for nearly 10 years as Brexit uncertainty depressed business activity. Ireland has expressed concern over a Conservative party pledge to change the law to protect former soldiers in Northern Ireland from possible prosecution over deaths during the Troubles. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now writing the blog for the rest of the night. If the flooding that hit the Midlands and northern England at the end of last week had happened in the south-east, it\u2019s more likely it would have been declared a national emergency, the Labour leader has claimed. Jeremy Corbyn has urged the prime minister to hold a Cobra meeting and take personal charge of the government\u2019s response as he says his party\u2019s analysis suggests the Environment Agency has lost a fifth of its frontline staff under Tory-led governments. Here is the full text of his letter to Boris Johnson: Over the past few days, we have both visited those affected by the devastating floods across Yorkshire and the east Midlands. You\u2019ll know that hundreds of homes have been flooded and over a thousand properties have now been evacuated. Our hearts go out to those affected, including the friends and family of Annie Hall. With heavy rain expected in parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands, in areas that are already suffering from flooding, hundreds of further flood warnings are in place. Rightly, there will be hundreds of thousands of people across these regions who remain concerned about their families and livelihoods. With this in mind, I am writing to urge you to hold a Cobra meeting and take personal charge of the government\u2019s response to the devastating flooding we have seen over the past few days. In addition, we need full assurance from the government that every resource is being utilised to aid those that need it and protect against future potential floods. With dozens of flood warnings still in place, I have to disagree with your assessment from the weekend that this is not a \u2018national emergency\u2019. If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the east Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared. Every year we don\u2019t act means higher flood waters, more homes ruined and more lives at risk due to climate change. The government also must ensure that the insurance industry fulfils its responsibilities. In addition, going forward the industry must continue to provide insurance at an affordable level to householders. I urge you again to hold a Cobra meeting to ensure all is being done to help the families affected. Patrick Maguire in the New Statesman argues that the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory-held seats won\u2019t be welcomed by all Conservative candidates in those constituencies. Here is an extract. Although Farage believes his intervention will kneecap the Liberal Democrats, some of its candidates in the south are still cautiously optimistic. Max Wilkinson, the party\u2019s candidate in Cheltenham \u2013 a top target \u2013 offered a bullish response on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m disturbed to see that Cheltenham\u2019s Conservative candidate at the election, Alex Chalk, has won the backing of Nigel Farage this time round. Pretty shocking that a so-called \u2018moderate\u2019 could stand on a joint ticket with a rightwing extremist.\u201d Candidates like Wilkinson will now discover whether Farage or Johnson is a bigger electoral asset for the Liberal Democrats. \u201cThe Brexit party were taking votes from the Conservatives,\u201d says one Liberal Democrat attempting to dislodge a Tory incumbent. \u201cBut this alliance will alienate so many Tory moderates, as Johnson\u2019s leadership already has in large numbers. The big question is whether we\u2019ve reached the floor already, whether there are more teetering on the brink, or whether this stops the very small bleed away of voters who are moderate but will consider voting Tory to get it over with.\u201d From the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused Sajid Javid, the chancellor, of trying to avoid a TV debate with him, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Here is one baby that Boris Johnson probably won\u2019t be getting his hands on. (See 4.53pm.) This is from Ellie Reeves, who is seeing re-election as Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge. The SNP has issued a statement about what it describes as the legal action being taken by \u201cone of the smaller parties\u201d (ie, the Lib Dems - see 4.49pm). It is from Kirsten Oswald, the SNP\u2019s business convenor and its candidate in East Renrewshire. It is utterly outrageous for any broadcaster to include a minor party like the Liberal Democrats and to exclude the SNP \u2013 who secured nearly three times as many seats at the last election, and whose current support suggests will continue to be the third-largest party in Westminster. We have made that clear to Sky, whose proposed debate is a democratic disgrace, and to ITV \u2013 and we are considering our next steps. In all of this, one thing that is clear, is the utter hypocrisy of the Lib Dems, who are happy to see a larger female-led party of remain excluded in their own self-interest as part of a typical Westminster stitch-up. A Green party candidate has withdrawn in a second marginal seat targeted by Labour, prompting speculation that more Greens could step aside as part of an informal anti-Conservative alliance not sanctioned by the central party, my colleague Peter Walker reports. My colleague Marina Hyde has written up the Nigel Farage press conference earlier. Here is an extract. \u201cSo in a sense,\u201d he concluded, gearing up for a vintage Farage reverse ferret, \u201cwe now HAVE a leave alliance. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve done it unilaterally.\u201d Funny sort of alliance. Maybe spend some of the two pound fifties on a dictionary. As for what had prompted this change of heart, was it a high-level personal meeting with Boris Johnson? Written undertakings? Formal assurances? None of these, actually. \u201cLast night I saw Boris Johnson on a video,\u201d conceded Farage, \u201csaying we won\u2019t extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020\u201d. Aha. The ultimate guarantee \u2013 a Boris Johnson tweet. If this was supposed to be a rally, you\u2019d have to call it Triumph of the Willy. Here was a guy who\u2019d spent 10 days bullishly making Johnson an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse. And yet, it seems the PM does not negotiate with Faragists. The Brexit party leader is one of those hapless movie villains who tells a millionaire he\u2019s kidnapped his wife, and the millionaire goes \u2013 great, you can keep her. And here is her article in full. It would not be a modern general election without a dispute about leaders\u2019 debates, and the current disagreement has moved to its next stage with the Liberal Democrats filing high court proceedings against the decision to exclude Jo Swinson from ITV\u2019s event. The application for judicial review over ITV\u2019s move to invite only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to take part in the debate on 19 November was filed to the high court on Monday afternoon. Speaking outside the court the Lib Dem president, Sal Brinton said: The TV debates offer the only chance for people to see how leaders compare to each other directly, in a neutral, equal and balanced format. For many people this is the moment they decide how they will vote. So it is vital for our democracy to have both sides of the Brexit debate represented at the top table of the leaders\u2019 debates. The party has been hugely critical of the decision to exclude Swinson. She will take part in a wider Sky News event on 28 November, though it is not yet clear which other leaders will participate. The BBC is also holding a Johnson-Corbyn debate, as well as other programmes with a wider cast list. Judicial review is a somewhat broad legal tactic, seeking a judge to examine whether a decision made by a public body was legal or not. Time could be against the Lib Dems, as the court needs to first decide if judicial review can take place, and then consider the specific issue. Both ITV and the BBC have defended their formats, saying Johnson and Corbyn lead the parties which took, between them, 82% of the votes in the 2017 election. This is from the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain. The BBC has apologised for mistakenly showing old footage of Boris Johnson laying a wreath on BBC Breakfast this morning, instead of footage from yesterday, when Johnson put his wreath down the wrong way round. The error has prompted claims on social media that this was evidence of pro-Tory bias. But the truth was more straightforward, according to Richard Frediani, executive editor of BBC Breakfast. Nigel Farage has claimed he was offered a peerage at the end of last week, the Mirror\u2019s Ben Glaze reports. Farage told the Mirror that he turned down the offer (he did not say who made it) and that he would not accept a knighthood or a peerage. Here is more from the politics academic Matthew Goodwin on the impact of the Brexit party standing aside in Tory-held seats. Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Tory seats is not as clear cut in Scotland as it may seem, since it could damage Tory campaigns to unseat the Scottish National party in at least one key target seat. A Brexit party spokesman has confirmed they will still stand candidates in SNP seats, and that could prove significant in Perth and North Perthshire, the Scottish Tories\u2019 top target seat. The Tories are fighting on two fronts: pledging to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d but also leveraging opposition to a second independence referendum. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart holds a wafer-thin, 21-vote (0.04%) majority over the Tories in Perth and North Perthshire. In the 2015 general election an arch-Brexiter standing for Ukip, John Miles, took 1,110 votes there. Wishart\u2019s chances of holding the seat were boosted when the pro-independence Scottish Green party decided at the weekend not to stand a candidate against him, decreasing direct competition for SNP votes. (See 1.57pm.) There is strong pro-Brexit sentiment in the area. The Brexit party came third in the council area of Perth &amp; Kinross in the 2019 European parliament elections, with 8,088 votes, and Ukip took another 770. Those pro-Brexit votes accounted for 17.5% of all those cast in the area. The Brexit party\u2019s candidate for Perth and North Perthshire, Stuart Powell, is campaigning with the pledge: \u201cWe are real people doing ordinary jobs and intend to serve rather than rule\u201d. While he was campaigning this morning, Boris Johnson was also asked if immigration would increase or decrease under Tory policies. He refused to say, replying: I do think immigration can place really unacceptable pressures on public services. Johnson said he was \u201cin favour of immigration as a whole\u201d as it allows \u201cpeople of talent\u201d to come to the UK. When pressed on whether his policies would result in a decrease in immigration numbers, Johnson replied: We will have a system that reflects the needs of the UK economy and a system that is finally subject to proper democratic control. On Saturday the Home Office minister Victoria Atkins was also unable to answer this question. Boris Johnson repeated his claim that he had given up alcohol \u201cuntil Brexit is done\u201d when he posed for a photograph at a pub in a Wolverhampton. He then added: \u201cI\u2019ll wet my whistle\u201d, before taking a sip from a pint. The SNP, like the Lib Dems, are also saying the Conservative party has now become the Brexit party. (See 3.11pm.) These are from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, claims Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Tory-won seats implies the government is planning a no-deal Brexit. In a statement, he said: That Nigel Farage is willing to endorse Boris Johnson is proof that they are planning to deliver a disastrous no deal. The fact that he assumes there will be no extension at the end of the next phase is evidence enough that a crash-out Brexit is an inevitability in the eyes of the Brexiteers. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage don\u2019t care about Wales. They want to rip us out of the EU in a disastrous crash-out Brexit which would decimate our agriculture and manufacturing sectors and devastate our economy. From my colleague Martin Belam The Tories have got a candidate in Hartlepool, my colleague Josh Halliday reports, correcting an earlier claim they didn\u2019t have one. (See 2.34pm.) Ireland has expressed concern over a Conservative party pledge to change the law to protect former soldiers in Northern Ireland from possible prosecution over deaths during the Troubles. The Tories have promised to end what they describe as \u201cunfair trials\u201d of soldiers accused of unlawful killings in Northern Ireland by amending the Human Rights Act to exclude any cases dating from before the act came into force in 2000. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, posted a tweet this morning saying this was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiter, told the BBC\u2019s World at One that Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement was a \u201cgood thing\u201d. He said: I would hope that this is the start of the Brexit party recognising that even standing across the board in [Labour-held] seats will also end up helping those Labour incumbents who are sitting there worrying at the moment about the fact that they have a very, very large leave vote, and if that is split, then that means they might just sneak through, which could be the difference between us winning a majority and only becoming the majority party and of course winning a majority is critical if you want to deliver Brexit and Boris to stay. Jeremy Corbyn has described the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory seats as a \u201cTrump alliance\u201d. He points out that this is exactly the sort of Boris Johnson/Nigel Farage pact that Donald Trump seemed to be proposing in his recent LBC interview with Farage. Last night Jeremy Corbyn posted this on Twitter in response to the news that Evo Morales has announced he will resign as president of Bolivia after the military called for him to step down and the police withdrew their support following weeks of unrest over disputed election results. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has accused Corbyn of putting \u201cMarxist solidarity\u201d ahead of his commitment to democracy. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that Nigel Farage\u2019s decision not to stand Brexit party candidates in Tory seats means the Conservatives are now aligned with the Brexit party. (In truth, the Lib Dems have been making this sort of claim for some time.) And the Lib Dem candidate Sam Gyimah has put it like this on Twitter. This is a version of the Alex Salmond/Ed Miliband poster that the Conservatives used in the 2015 election campaign. It is a punchy image, although it misses the point Farage is the person today who has capitulated to Boris Johnson. Paul Sweeney, the Labour candidate in Glasgow North and a shadow Scotland Office minister, has said that no UK government could refuse another Scottish independence referendum if there is a pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament. But, speaking in George Square in Glasgow after a ceremony marking the Armistice in 1918, Sweeney said independence was not an issue for this election. He said: The reality is [independence] isn\u2019t an issue for this election. The reality is this is an issue for the Scottish parliament election in 2021. We\u2019ve been clear that if a mandate were to happen, then no government in the UK could stand against that, even the Tories have admitted that\u2019s the case. We\u2019re saying it\u2019s not an issue for this election. Let\u2019s focus on getting a Labour government into power that can invest in our public services. The key question for the Brexit party and the Conservatives is what is going to happen in the Labour-held leave-voting seats where they both fancy their chances. Will there be some sort of unofficial non-aggression pact, where they divide up targets between them? We don\u2019t know but my colleague Josh Halliday has just posted these about the contest in Hartlepool, the Labour-held seat where Richard Tice, the Brexit party chairman, is standing. UPDATE: Actually, there is a Tory candidate. Josh subsequently posted this. YouGov, the polling company, has sent out an analysis of the Nigel Farage decision saying it is unlikely to be a \u201cgame-changing moment\u201d for the election. This is from its political research manager, Chris Curtis. Farage\u2019s decision to stand aside in current Conservative-held seats and not in Labour-held seats that the Tories will be looking to gain will likely make very little difference. There are three caveats to this. Firstly, whilst there has been a swing towards the Tories in their battle against Labour, the increase in Lib Dem and SNP vote share means that there is likely to be a swing against them in seats where they are battling against those parties. However, there are not as many of these seats as there are Labour/Conservative marginals, and most of them will be the kind of places where the Brexit party wouldn\u2019t have won many votes anyway, such as in Scotland or more remain-leaning seats in the south. Secondly, it does help mitigate against the effects of a surge in support for Labour during this campaign. If the Labour vote share does start to recover, in the same way it did in 2017, this will make it more difficult for the party to start gaining seats from the Tories. However, on current polling it will take quite a turnaround of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s fortunes in order to reach this point. Finally, whilst the practical effect might be quite small, we don\u2019t know what effect Farage\u2019s message might have on the broader perceptions of the parties. It could be that even in seats where the Brexit party are standing, voters that might otherwise have supported the party now feel more comfortable voting Conservative after Farage\u2019s comments. However, given the Brexit party was already trending downwards in the polls, it looked like this was happening already. So, despite today\u2019s drama, this is unlikely to be a game-changing moment. These are from my colleague Rajeev Syal, who has been in the high court this morning. I\u2019ve been back on the Lib Dems\u2019 electric-powered battle bus, and for once the party was not talking about Brexit. Sam Gyimah, the recently-defected former Tory MP who now speaks on business matters for the Lib Dems, was taken all the way from Westminster to Marylebone Road \u2013 slightly over two miles \u2013 to talk about the slightly awkwardly-named \u201cskills wallet\u201d plan, a commitment to give all adults \u00a310,000 to spend on training over various points in their lives. He visited a company that provides tech-based apprenticeships, called WhiteHat. It was co-founded by none other than Euan Blair, eldest son of the former Labour PM, but he is currently on paternity leave and so missed any awkward questions about who he might vote for. Gyimah, a former universities minister, happily chatted to staff and apprentices about all sorts of subjects, not least tuition fees, something of a toxic subject for the Lib Dems after they broke their 2010 manifesto pledge to support higher fees in the coalition government. Gyimah would not say what Lib Dem policy would be ahead of the party\u2019s manifesto, but spoke strongly against ending fees, saying this ends up rationing access to higher education. This brought no murmurs of dissent from the apprentices. Perhaps they were being polite, or having decided against university it was less of an issue. But it could also be that as younger voters, the events of 2010 feel like ancient history. The Lib Dems will certainly hope so. Gyimah has abandoned the East Surrey seat he represented since 2010 to try his luck in Kensington. Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad took this from the Conservatives in 2017, with the Lib Dems a distant third. Speaking to me on the bus before the visit, Gyimah said he hoped to do well in a strongly pro-remain area, and to capitalise on Dent Coad\u2019s occasionally divisive reputation: My pitch is that Kensington can do better than a hard Brexiteer or a class warrior ... I knock on doors and I talk about views I passionately believe in, and there are a lot of voters who are welcoming of those view. To be honest, it would be more difficult the other way if I was holding my views as a Conservative, in a Conservative seat. Will he do it? Some polls have Gyimah currently second behind the Tories, but given the volatility of the election it is not impossible he could win. The Scottish Greens have decided not to stand candidates in two hyper-marginal seats being defended by the Scottish National party, boosting the SNP\u2019s hopes of holding them. The pro-independence Scottish Green party (SGP) said its local branches had opted not to contest North East Fife, won by the SNP by just two votes in 2017, and Perth &amp; North Perthshire, held by the SNP with a 21-vote margin in 2017, for \u201cvarious reasons\u201d. The SNP is under intense pressure in both seats, with the Liberal Democrats determined to regain North East Fife from Stephen Gethins, the SNP\u2019s international affairs spokesman, and the Scottish Tories investing heavily in defeating Pete Wishart in Perth and North Perthshire. The Tories have repeatedly tried to unseat Wishart, who was furious when he found the SGP had a candidate to stand against him. He accused them of helping the Tories by diluting the pro-independence vote, leading to angry attacks on Green politicians on social media. On Sunday, hours after the local SGP branch decided not to contest his seat, Wishart tweeted a recommendation by one tactical voting website, Progressive Alliance, to back him. The SGP fielded a candidate in the 2015 election, taking 1,146 votes, and there is little love lost between the two parties. The Scottish Greens are highly critical of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s defence of North Sea oil and say her record on the climate crisis is much weaker than her rhetoric. An SGP denied this was an organised deal to protect pro-independence seats: they are likely to attack Wishart\u2019s record of voting for the oil industry. A SGP spokesman said: Pete Wishart describing this as standing aside is a bit cute. They\u2019ve not stood aside for him. A large part of it is about concentrating our resources on 2021 [the Scottish parliament elections]; that\u2019s the main reason why most of our branches have opted not to stand [this time]. The Scottish Greens won 1,387 votes in North East Fife in 2015, when Gethins first took the seat from the Liberal Democrats when Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader retired after nearly 30 years as the local MP. Despite backing out in that seat, they are contesting another SNP marginal nearby, of Dunfermline and West Fife. They took 1,196 votes there in 2015; the SNP held the seat by 844 votes in 2017. In an interview on the World at One Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s lead elections expert and the person who oversees the national exit poll, said that although Nigel Farage\u2019s decision would not make a big difference, it would probably wipe out the advantage that the Lib Dems gained from the remain alliance pact announced last week. The Brexit party is standing down in seats the Tories held in 2017. But, given the state of the opinion polls (which generally show the Tories ahead of Labour by around 10 points - a much larger margin than on election night in 2017), the Conservatives would currently expect to hold most of these anyway, Curtice said. He said there were two exceptions to this. In Scotland the Tories are at risk of losing seats to the SNP, he said. But he said the Brexit party was weak in Scotland, so \u201cthis is probably not going to help the Tories very much in that,\u201d Curtice said. The main impact would be in seats where the Tories faced a strong Lib Dem challenge, Curtice said. It is here perhaps that the decision of the Brexit party to stand down might at the margin help the Conservatives because some of these seats, though by no means all of them, are ones where there was quite a substantial leave vote last time - places like North Cornwall and North Devon ... Put it like this; perhaps last week, by their own alliance, the remain alliance, the Liberal Democrats might have helped themselves to pick up another half dozen seats. Those seats may have gone as a result of today\u2019s decision. Curtice said in Labour-held seats, where the Brexit party still intends to stand, the Farage decision would not make much difference. But he included this qualifier: Unless, of course, that by standing down in so many seats the credibility of the Brexit party, which already seems to have seeped away quite considerably ... it may just simply mean that, even though the Brexit party stands, that the Brexit party loses some of its voters, and it helps the Tories that way. Summing up the overall impact, Curtice said: We perhaps should not exaggerate how important this is. It is the Liberal Democrat/Conservative contests where the Tories might be helped out. But in the crucial Conservative/Labour ones, so far at least, Mr Farage is not offering the Conservatives any direct help. Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement has lifted sterling on the foreign exchange markets. The pound has hit a six-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.168. Sterling is also up a cent against the US dollar at $1.288. City traders are calculating that a hung parliament is now less likely - although the Brexit party will still be competing in Conservative target seats. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: It\u2019s a massive moment for the campaign and gives the Tories a clear run at Downing Street. But it will not make it any easier to hoover up seats from opposition parties \u2013 the risk of the Brexit party sucking in leaver votes in areas being targeted by the Tories remains. For Labour and in particular the Lib Dems in the south of England, it\u2019s going to make life very hard to dislodge incumbent Tories. And here is an essay question from another politics professor, Chris Hanretty. This is from Will Tanner, the former No 10 aide who now runs the Conservative thinktank Onward. These are from Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor specialising in the rise of Brexit party-style national populist parties. Boris Johnson has welcomed the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory seats. Here is my colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s full story about Nigel Farage\u2019s decision. Here is some more comment on Nigel Farage\u2019s decision from journalists. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From my colleague Owen Jones From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker From my colleague Peter Walker From the Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From Isabel Oakeshott From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From my colleague Dan Milmo From the Times\u2019 Daniel Finkelstein From Bloomberg This is undoubtedly the best news that Boris Johnson has had during the election campaign so far. It doesn\u2019t mean that the result of the election is now a foregone conclusion, and it does not mean that a hung parliament is now impossible, as Nigel Farage claimed, but the result of an election in which the Brexit party is not standing in Tory seats will probably not be the same as an election in which it was splitting the Brexit vote in those constituencies. Only 10 days ago, when Farage announced that he would be standing candidates in around 600 seats in Britain, he was claiming that his tactic might harm Labour more than the Conservatives. At the time, election experts said he was wrong and that Tory seats were most at risk. Today Farage has admitted they were right, and he was wrong. But how much difference will this make in practice? It it hard to say, but two points are worth stressing. First, Farage is making this announcement because his poll ratings have been falling. He is capitulating from a position of weakness, not a position of strength. The polls have not shifted a great deal in the past week, but one constant feature is that the Brexit party vote has been heading south. Perhaps he was not as big a threat to the Tories as people thought. Here are the figures from the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker. Second, the Brexit party still seems to be intent on standing candidates in Tory target seats - particularly the leave-leaning Labour seats in the north of England, where for a long time Farage has been saying his party could do well. In theory the Brexit party could still split the Brexit vote in these place, preventing Boris Johnson from making the gains he needs to win a majority. But it wouldn\u2019t be in Farage\u2019s interests to do this if he wants Johnson to have a majority, and so it seems more likely that, in reality, the Tories and the Brexit party will operate unofficial non-aggression pacts in these places, allowing the best placed party to challenge Labour. That would be what you would expect from a \u201cleave alliance\u201d, which is what he now says exists. (See 12.19pm.) Farage\u2019s climbdown is considerable. Only 10 days ago he was saying that Johnson would have to abandon his Brexit plan wholesale for the Brexit party to give up its plan to stand 600 candidates in Britain. Since then, Johnson has said nothing that amounts to any form of concession, and the points the PM has been making about wanting to break free of EU regulation are ones he has always been making. And, as Farage himself acknowledged, the promise not to extend the transition beyond the end of 2020 is effectively worthless in the light of what happened to Johnson\u2019s \u201cdie in the ditch\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October. The only face-saving offer from the PM was the fact that he posted a video last night making these points, effectively offering Farage a ladder down which he could climb. (See 12.13pm.) There is already speculation that Farage came under pressure to concede from Johnson\u2019s ally, Donald Trump. This is from the Labour MP David Lammy. Farage\u2019s announcement may also prompt the BBC and other broadcasters to reconsider how they cover the Brexit party during the campaign. The BBC had invited him to a seven-party debate, and to a Question Time special. And all broadcasters have been covering the party on the assumption it is a GB-wide party, fighting all seats. In the light of today\u2019s news, we may see less of Farage on TV than before. That could further suppress his vote. One final point. Until relatively recently it was assumed that if the Tories tried to fight an election without having delivered Brexit, they would get smashed by the Brexit party. Almost all media commentators thought this, but so did Johnson himself, and probably Farage too. But that was another piece of conventional political wisdom (like the idea that Jeremy Corbyn could never win a Labour leadership contest) that turned out to be nonsense. You could cite this as proof that the Westminster commentariat are all rubbish (perhaps we are?), but it is probably better seen as evidence that voter behaviour is inherently unpredictable. Farage says he is taking this decision to prevent the risk of a second Brexit referendum. He says that what he is announcing is, in practice, a leave alliance. Farage says he weighed up Johnson\u2019s promises against the threat that the Brexit party standing could let the Lib Dems in. Farage says the Brexit party will not stand against the Tories in the 317 seats they won in 2017. But it will concentrate its efforts on seats held by the Labour party. And it will also challenge other remainer parties. Farage says last night he saw something that was optimistic. He says he saw a video of Boris Johnson saying he would not extend the Brexit transition. He says people might say Johnson broke his promise not to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. But at least this was an unequivocal statement. But Farage says Johnson also said he would negotiate a super Canada-plus trade deal with no alignment. Here is the video Farage is referring to. Farage says he tried to build a leave alliance. He tried to put out the idea that putting country before party was the right thing to do. But that came to naught, he says. Farage says he has had to consider what the consequences of this would be. He says he does not accept fielding 600 candidates would allow Jeremy Corbyn to win. But, he says, he does think that would have led to there being a hung parliament. And it would have led to a large number of Lib Dem gains. If the remainer parties could get to 320 seats, there would be a second referendum, he says. He says the UK would be offered a false choice between remain, and a form of remain. He says it has not been easy to decide what to do. Farage says what he was worried about most was that the UK would align itself to EU rules under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan. He says he thought this was not real Brexit. That is why the Brexit party decided to stand candidates in 600 seats. Farage says he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d when he heard about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Unlike many people who praised it, he read it, and drew the conclusion it was not Brexit, he says. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is speaking now. He says he will reveal his party\u2019s election strategy in a moment. From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam My colleague Kate Proctor is in Hartlepool for the Brexit party news conference, which is due to start shortly. She has just posted this on Twitter. And the Labour party has today committed to having a qualified, on-site counsellor in every secondary school in England, as part of a \u201chealthy young minds\u201d plan worth \u00a3845m a year. The party is also committing to setting up a network of mental health hubs to allow children more access to mental health support and ensuring every primary school has access to a qualified counsellor. In a news release about the plan, Jeremy Corbyn said: Almost every day someone talks to me about the terrible stresses a child or young person they know are going through. Mental health workers do incredible work but our society is fuelling mental illness on a huge scale and our young people are not getting the support they need. As a country, we have to start treating mental health as seriously as physical health. If we don\u2019t help our young people, we are not only failing them, but storing up problems for the future for a whole generation. The SNP has this morning called for at least \u00a31bn of North Sea revenues to be set aside to help areas heavily dependent on oil and gas make the switch to a greener economy. With the Office for Budget Responsibility having forecast the UK\u2019s oil and gas sector will raise \u00a38.5bn in revenue over the next five years, the SNP is calling for that cash to be ring-fenced in its entirety, to fund efforts to tackle the climate crisis. As the Press Association reports, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is saying that at least \u00a31bn should be set aside to support a \u201cjust transition\u201d for areas like the north-east, Falkirk and Shetland where the oil and gas industry is a major employer. In a statement issued this morning Sturgeon said: The SNP will never argue for the oil and gas industry to be shut down overnight. We must do everything in our power to tackle the climate crisis and Scotland has set the most ambitious legal targets in the world. But we also have to ensure that areas like the north-east of Scotland, where the economy has been built on the oil and gas industry, are supported to make the transition to new low or no carbon industries. SNP ministers have already put through legislation committing Scotland to achieving net zero emissions by 2045 - five years ahead of the UK target. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is in Hartlepool today, and at 12pm he will be holding a press conference. Perhaps he will announce he has been appointed by Boris Johnson as the UK\u2019s new European commission? (See 11.23am.) Probably not. But Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall says Farage will announce whether the party remains committed to standing candidates in almost all seats in Britain. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. And this is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has just come back from the No 10 lobby briefing. (During the election campaign the civil service wing of Downing Street briefs journalists just once a week, on Mondays.) Labour continues to face criticism over its decision to select Kate Osborne as its candidate in Jarrow despite the fact that two years ago she posted a picture on social media showing a gun being held to Theresa May\u2019s head. According to a party source, 37 members of the Jarrow CLP (constituency Labour party) have written to Jennie Formby, the party\u2019s general secretary, saying that even though Osborne has apologised, she should not be a candidate. Her selection \u201csends a message that threats of violence against women in politics can sometimes be accepted\u201d, the letter claims. Here is Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, responding to comments by Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, in her Today interview this morning that she personally supported military intervention in Kosovo to protect Albanians from Serbia. Thornberry was replying to a question about how Jeremy Corbyn didn\u2019t back this campaign, or other recent occasions when the UK government decided to deploy the armed forces. Adam Wagner, the barrister and legal blogger, has posted a useful Twitter feed about the Tory plan to amend the Human Rights Act to say it does not apply to events before 2000, in an attempt to limit prosecutions of armed forces veterans over historical cases. (See 7.38am and 8.05am.) It starts here. And here are two of his main points. And here is the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire on the same plan. Britain has narrowly avoided going into recession, according to the official growth figures out this morning. My colleague Graeme Wearden has all the details on his business live blog. From Boris Johnson\u2019s point of view, as an election development that\u2019s probably an item of news to file under the category \u201cit could have been worse\u201d. The claim in the Daily Express splash (they were taking a punt before the growth figures were published) that the economy is \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d is laughable. As Graeme reports in his blog, annual growth is at the lowest level since 2010. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also said that Labour would introduce \u201cmanaged migration\u201d for EU nationals in the event Brexit happens. Peter\u2019s full story is here. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. It was only a matter of time before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on nuclear weapons became an election issue, and this morning it has happened. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, gave a series of interviews this morning and, given that it is Armistice Day and that both main parties have been announcing policies relating to the armed forces, it was not surprising that Thornberry was asked about defence policy, and in particular nuclear weapons. In interviews on Good Morning Britain and the Today programme, Thornberry was asked if Jeremy Corbyn would ever authorise the use of nuclear weapons. Soon after being elected Labour leader in 2015, Corbyn said categorically that he would never authorise the use of nuclear weapons. But, as a party, Labour supports the nuclear deterrent, and the multi-billion pound spending programme to renew the Trident nuclear weapons programme, and during the 2017 election campaign Corbyn struggled during a TV debate when asked if he would be willing to use the missiles Labour would be spending so much money on. Thornberry made three points in response to these questions. She refused to say whether or not Corbyn would be willing to use nuclear weapons. She told Today: Jeremy would do anything to protect our country and whether or not we use nuclear weapons is not something I think that we should be talking about in advance. And she told Good Morning Britain. The use of a nuclear weapon is a decision on a level that no politician anywhere has to make. It is completely out on its own. And no one in the end knows how they would use it, whether they would use it, because it is, it has such extraordinary force and millions of people can be killed. She claimed that previous prime ministers had refused to say whether or not they would use nuclear weapons. She told Good Morning Britain: No leader has said one way or the other until very recently whether they were prepared to use the nuclear weapon or not. And she told the Today programme: One of the reasons that Margaret Thatcher would not answer that question is because she said in order to protect ourselves we have to be clear that we will do whatever we can to protect ourselves and we are not prepared to say one way or the other in what circumstances we would use nuclear weapons. On this point, Thornberry is wrong. Previous prime ministers have routinely said that, in extremis, they would be willing to use a nuclear weapon. The deterrent only has deterrent value if people think it might be used. What is true, though, is that previous prime ministers have not discussed the exact circumstances in which it would or would not be used. Thornberry claimed any Labour decision over the use of nuclear weapons might not just be taken by Corbyn on his own. She told Good Morning Britain: I don\u2019t necessarily believe that it will be a decision that will be made by one individual. I suspect that the way that Jeremy makes decisions is that he takes advice and that we work collectively. I am not prepared to go into whether we would use nuclear weapons or not, whether we would make a decision collectively to use nuclear weapons or not, in what circumstances. This is also questionable. Although prime ministers consult on almost all decisions, ultimately the final say with decisions about war rest with the PM. In response to her interviews, the Conservatives are urging Labour to clarify its position. In a statement issued by CCHQ, the defence minister Johnny Mercer said: It is important that Labour urgently clarifies their position on whether or not they would actually be prepared to use our nuclear deterrent if needed. They should start by telling us who exactly will sit on this committee that would consider whether or not to authorise a nuclear strike or not in the face of a foreign threat? Although there is an inherent contradiction in Labour\u2019s policy \u2013 no one who knows anything about Corbyn believes for a moment he would ever authorise a nuclear strike, regardless of what the party\u2019s official position is \u2013 it is worth pointing out that there are good reasons to question whether any PM would, in extremis, authorise a nuclear attack. Three years ago the BBC filmed a simulated war gaming exercise, which involved former top military figures and government officials deciding how to respond to a Russian invasion of Latvia. The exercise ended with Russia launching a nuclear attack against the west. To the apparent surprise of the film-makers, the committee decided not to retaliate with a nuclear attack against Russia, on the grounds that the consequences would be just too awful. Later, on the Today programme, Thornberry said service personnel would be paid a \u201cproper wage\u201d through the lifting of the public sector pay cap under Labour\u2019s proposals. We ask them to make the ultimate sacrifice and the least we can do is to give them some decent pay. They have effectively had a pay cut over the last few years and we think that is wrong. So much of the accommodation provided to the military is through the private sector and some of it is really terrible. Thornberry welcomed the Tories\u2019 pledge to stop \u201cvexatious and unfair actions\u201d against veterans, but pointed towards Theresa May\u2019s undelivered announcement of a similar policy. However, she said she did not believe the Human Rights Act had to be changed to address this, and said prosecuting authorities should instead not allow such claims to be heard in court. Questioned about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal support for the armed forces, Thornberry said: \u201cWhen you see Jeremy interacting with members of the armed services \u2026 you can see he is incredibly empathetic.\u201d However, she was unable to provide an example of when Corbyn backed UK military action abroad. I think that people from the military listening to the radio this morning, and those from their families and supporters, would want the same that we do, which is, if and when we use military action, we use military action in order to ensure we can stop genocides or unfair actions happening. In principle, Jeremy is not a pacifist, we are not pacifists. There will be times where we need to use military force. But when we use it we need to ensure it actually makes the situation better in the long term. Pointing to interventions in the Middle East and Libya, she said recent military campaigns had not led to what the UK had wanted. Nevertheless, she restated Labour\u2019s support for maintaining the Trident nuclear weapons system. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has been questioned over what would be on the ballot paper under Labour\u2019s plans to offer a second referendum. We want to be able to negotiate the sort of deal that we have been talking to the Europeans about for more than three years. It is being in a customs union, in a single market, in a close alignment of rules and regulations. We have talked to them uphill and down dale about what it is we would do and what our deal is. And we think that\u2019s the best way of looking after jobs in the economy. She was also asked whether she would use a nuclear weapon to defend the UK. Moving on to another election pledge, Wallace said serving personnel would be provided with free wraparound care for their four- to 11-year-old children. The \u00a3165m scheme to help service people \u201cwith their pressures\u201d would be introduced alongside a veterans\u2019 railcard and a new help-to-buy scheme under a future Tory government. \u201cWe\u2019re going to invest in the most important equipment of our armed forces if we win this election and that is our servicemen and women,\u201d he said. There should be a 10-year limit on the prosecution of soldiers unless \u201ccompelling new evidence\u201d emerges, Wallace said. But he stressed the UK would not be leaving the European court of human rights. Asked what exactly would change, Wallace said: Firstly in events that have happened outside the jurisdiction of the [European court of human rights], such as Afghanistan and Iraq, the government believes there should be a statute of limitations of at least 10 years unless compelling new evidence comes forward to make sure that we can\u2019t have lawyers \u2026 going out shopping round Iraq and Afghanistan looking for victims. Asked whether it would apply to everyone who might be involved in these inquests, including paramilitaries, terrorists and soldiers, Wallace said it would apply for all. If you want to make a claim that an already investigated crime or already inquest event has taken place, and in some of these inquests we\u2019re into the third or fourth inquest of the same event, if one of these has already taken place and you want to go back and effectively in some areas abuse our legal system with new evidence without much specifics, then actually you need to go direct to the European court in the Hague. Asked how this is not an \u201camnesty for terrorists\u201d, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not an amnesty. Everyone will still be able to avail themselves of the European court of human rights in the Hague. But what they won\u2019t be able to avail themselves of the right, is continually going back to our courts in the UK.\u201d Questioned over his previous remarks in the House of Commons, when he said \u201cI don\u2019t support amnesty for people who went out and killed many of these young men and women who went out to defend us. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a solution\u201d, he replied: I don\u2019t. This is about people who have already had trials, already been prosecuted, already had inquests \u2026 People have been tried, under inquest found not to have been at fault, then suddenly along comes a claim of new evidence. Very rarely does it see much test before it falls over and time and time again our service personnel are reinvestigated. We\u2019re not leaving the European convention on human rights, what we\u2019re doing is changing the route to that and we\u2019re saying that our courts are not there to be abused. There are inquests going on at the moment to things that have gone on in the 1970s that have already been two or three inquests. Questioned over the failure of previous defence secretary\u2019s to promise to deliver the proposal, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to finish this.\u201d Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has said the Conservatives\u2019 election pledge to protect veterans from prosecution is not an \u201camnesty\u201d. He said the Tories\u2019 pledge to change the law would protect veterans from \u201cvexatious\u201d legal action and would take up the defence select committee\u2019s recent recommendations on limiting prosecutions of soldiers. Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that conflicts between different pieces of international law have meant that lawyers defending people representing \u201cterrorists killed in the act of terror\u201d have led to \u201ccontinued, repeated\u201d inquests. How do we make sure that soldiers are not above the law but that vexatious claims don\u2019t trigger continued investigations time and time again into the same people? That is unfair to our soldiers and people who\u2019ve gone out to defend us, whether that\u2019s in Iraq, Afghanistan or Northern Ireland. Asked on whether the law would apply retroactively, Wallace noted the independence of the judiciary and said that the changes would apply only to future prosecutions. This isn\u2019t an amnesty, because if people haven\u2019t been investigated and they haven\u2019t had an inquest, then of course they won\u2019t be able to avail themselves of that. This is about repeated and vexatious claims. This is about people who have already had trials, have already been prosecuted, already had inquests. The Conservatives want to end unfair trials of veterans where no new evidence has been produced and the accusations have been questioned exhaustively in court by amending the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents \u2013 including deaths during the Troubles \u2013 which took place before the law came into force in 2000. In July, the House of Commons defence select committee said a 10-year \u201cqualified statute of limitations\u201d should be introduced to protect veterans and serving armed forces personnel from reinvestigation for alleged crimes. It also called on the government to consider amending the Human Rights Act to provide a presumption against prosecution for historical offences. The report, Drawing a Line: Protecting Veterans By a Statute of Limitations, criticised the government for breaking a promise to safeguard veterans of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles from the \u201cspectre\u201d of repeated investigations of events that occurred decades ago. And it welcomed previous Ministry of Defence (MoD) proposals to opt out from the European convention on human rights during future conflicts. However, it points out that under MoD plans those who served in Northern Ireland and those who served abroad would be subject to different legislative regimes. The MoD and Northern Ireland Office have been in dispute over such reforms. However, Sinn F\u00e9in has previously raised fears over the amnesty proposal. One of the party\u2019s MPs, Francie Molloy, said that any attempt to create a hierarchy \u201cby protecting perpetrators of murders and other serious crime committed by British state forces are totally unacceptable\u201d. News that British Steel may be about to be bought by a Chinese conglomerate for \u00a370m could spark discussion about Britain\u2019s industrial policy on the campaign trail. A deal with Jingye Group could go through in the next couple of days according to our reporter Rob Davies, who has seen an email sent to employees about the sale. That is good news for the company\u2019s 4,000 employees, most of whom work in the marginal constituency of Scunthorpe. The seat is held by Labour\u2019s Nic Dakin with a majority of just over 3,000. The North Lincolnshire town is traditional Labour territory but it also voted heavily for Brexit \u2013 68.68% in favour of leaving compared with 31.32% for remain. Here\u2019s Rob\u2019s full story: On the Ulster campaign trail, the SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, says Northern Ireland should become a leader in renewable energy technology. Eastwood, who is standing for the constituency of Foyle, says better education of children to raise awareness of global warming is a moral imperative. We cannot force our children and their children to pay the price for our casual disregard for the body of science which says we are destroying our climate. We should also take the opportunity to become a world leader in renewable technology and climate rehabilitation. Keith Vaz announced last night he was standing down, a move that spares Jeremy Corbyn a tricky issue because the longstanding MP for Leicester East was facing suspension from the Commons for \u201cexpressing interest\u201d in buying cocaine for prostitutes. Vaz, who won the seat from the Tories in 1987, said in a statement that the people of Leicester \u201cwill always be in my heart\u201d. He continued: I have decided to retire after completing 32 years as the Member of Parliament for Leicester East. In that time I have won eight general elections. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve my constituency since I came to the city in 1985. I want to thank the people of Leicester East for their absolute loyalty and support. Corbyn paid generous tribute to his now ex-parliamentary colleague, saying: Keith Vaz was among the pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987. I was proud to support his selection and incredibly proud when he won, taking the seat from the Tories. Keith has made a substantial and significant contribution to public life, both as a constituency MP for the people of Leicester and for the Asian community across the country. He has helped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics. His work in parliament has been exemplary as Britain\u2019s first Asian-origin minister, chair of the home affairs select committee, a campaigner on diabetes issues and most recently trying to help the peace process in Yemen. You can read our full story on his decision here: Most of the papers lead with election-related stories, with the Times going on the row over Labour\u2019s spending plans and the Mail and the Telegraph leading on the Tories\u2019 rehashed policy to ban prosecutions of veterans. Here are some of the front pages: Boris Johnson will visit the Black Country today as he pushes his party\u2019s policies to help service personnel and veterans. Jeremy Corbyn will be with other senior members of the Labour leadership team to discuss migration policy. The Lib Dems are talking about education and will promise every adult in England \u00a310,000 to spend on education and training throughout their life. It seems likely that Nigel Farage will have something to say about both immigration and veterans when he launches the Brexit party\u2019s campaign in Hartlepool. Also present will be the party\u2019s chairman, Richard Tice, who is standing as MP for the Teesside town. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be on the stump in Aberdeen. Good morning. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and welcome to the election live blog. The fifth day of the campaign might be Armistice Day but there is no prospect of a ceasefire between the parties. The unusual instance of Remembrance Day falling in an election campaign has left the big players unable to resist promoting policies for veterans. The Tories are planning to offer more childcare help for families in the military, a railcard for veterans and will also repeat previous pledges to prevent \u201cvexatious\u201d legal claims such as those faced by ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Labour has said it will improve pay and conditions for service personnel by scrapping the public sector pay cap, better housing and improved access to schools for children of force members. Another major focus will be immigration. Our political editor, Heather Stewart, reports that Labour activists are pushing Jeremy Corbyn to incorporate radical changes to migration policy in the party\u2019s manifesto. Senior leaders are meeting today to thrash out the party\u2019s definitive stance with many calling for them to adopt the more open border policy backed by members at party conference in September. The Tories are hoping to portray Labour as soft on immigration and believe that a more liberal policy could cost Corbyn votes in northern and Midlands heartland seats. One Midlands seat that will be a bit different this time is Leicester East, where Keith Vaz\u2019s name will not be on the ballot paper for the first time in 32 years. The former minister, who was facing suspension from the Commons for \u201cexpressing willingness\u201d to purchase cocaine for sex workers, announced last night that he is standing down. Vaz, who is 62, said it had been \u201can honour and a privilege to serve my constituency\u201d, while Corbyn said Vaz had led the way for black and Asian Labour MPs. No campaign day would be complete without a spending row and this one will be no exception with Labour hitting back at Tory claims that its policies would cost \u00a31.2tn. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s election coordinator, described the claims as \u201cabsolute work of fiction by the Conservatives\u201d. Our economic correspodent, Richard Partington, has interrogated the Tory claims and concludes that they have added in the cost of Labour policies over a five-year period to inflate the headline number.
