Goodness, how it's changed - and, I think, very largely for the better. For example, as anyone who's read Tom Sharpe's Cambridge novels will know, the head porter of a college was a figure of the most extraordinary grandeur, far more powerful than any mere master, a personage rather than a person. He was similar to the regimental sergeant-major who, when addressing a junior officer, could freight the single syllable \"Sir!\" with multiple layers of condescension, or even contempt. One of the porter's jobs was to close the college gates at exactly 11.59, so obliging all the young persons running down the street to climb in, dangerously, at the back. Now the porters' lodge is friendly, helpful and obliging. It's like visiting Starbucks, only chummier. And nobody needs to climb in, since every undergraduate has a key to the outside gates as well as to his or her room. And there are lots of women. I went to a lecture on the Victorian novel, attended by 51 people; I was one of only seven men. I was a guest at High Table (no longer raised, but just at one end of the dining hall). As a student I had always looked with mild envy at the dons enjoying fine foods and even finer wines, no doubt engaged in brilliant intellectual banter, or perhaps CP Snow-style plotting and backbiting. I wore a suit and tie, hoping that would be formal enough, but in fact I was the only bloke with a tie; all the fellows were in open-neck shirts and pullovers. However, it was the night for the undergraduates' weekly \"formal\" at which, for a tenner a head, they can invite their friends in to enjoy the same food and wine as their tutors. So it was the dons who looked like students and the students who looked as if they had just wandered in from a grand wedding. \u00b7 Thanks for all your help tracking down the evasive PG Wodehouse description of a hangover: \"The door opened, and a cat stamped into the room.\" Suggested solutions included the notion that it might be by James Thurber (it isn't), or that it was just a good joke which got attributed to Wodehouse because it sounded like him. The mystery was solved when I got an email from Hilary Bruce, who chairs the UK branch of the PG Wodehouse Society. \"The quote is actually, 'the noise of the cat stamping about in the passage outside caused him exquisite discomfort.' This occurs about halfway through The Man Who Gave Up Smoking, the second chapter of Mr Milliner Speaking, which can also be found in the Mulliner Omnibus. Tony Ring, editor of the society's journal Wooster Sauce, tracked it down this morning while reading on a train.\" Thank you both. \u00b7 Time to pay tribute to a writer whom, I suspect, very few Guardian readers ever see. This week marks 50 years since Michael Wharton began to write The Way of the World column in the Daily Telegraph, above the name of Peter Simple. My battered old copy of the Best of Peter Simple is dated 1964, less than a decade after he started, and most of the main characters were already in place: Mrs Dutt-Pauker, the Hampstead thinker (I suspect she would live in Islington now), Julian Birdbath, the novelist, J Bonington Jagworth, the eminent motorist, the Socialist Royal Family, Dr Heinz Kiosk, psychiatric adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture, and Alderman Jabez Foodbotham, the crag-visaged, iron-watch-chained chairman of the Bradford tramways and fine arts committee, who will one day awake from his age-long sleep in a granite mausoleum on Cleckheaton Moor. I don't suppose either man would be glad to have me say it, but I am slightly reminded of Michael Frayn, who, unlike the proudly reactionary Wharton, wrote his Guardian column from the left of centre. Both created an extraordinary galere of characters with tremendous staying power. Simple's Seth Roentgen, Britain's leading scientific farmer, and Dr Spacely-Trellis, the bishop of Bevindon - often to be heard on Thought For The Day - are still with us, as are Frayn's Christopher Smoothe, Minister of Chance and Speculation, and Rollo Swavely, the well-known public relations consultant. Frayn I virtually always agreed with, as any young Guardian reader would. But Peter Simple was a guilty pleasure. There was a small, slight frisson when I realised that I actually concurred with something he said, whether about various African tyrants, trendy playwrights, or Harold Wilson. But then many of the real people he excoriated seem to have, in retrospect, become fictional characters themselves - Lord Longford, Dr Hastings Banda, the Red Dean, Edith Summerskill, Ernest Marples. Did they ever really exist? And if they had not, would a Frayn or a Wharton have been required to invent them? \u00b7 Lynne Truss's new book, the follow-up to Eats, Shoots and Leaves (which was a best-seller even in foreign languages, for heavens sake) is in bookshop windows everywhere now. It's called Talk to the Hand, and is billed as a guide to modern manners. In fact it is a shout of rage against modern behaviour, which isn't quite the same thing. It's fun to read and to see how one shares so many of her hatreds, from homicidal cyclists to cold-calling salesmen, and another pet peeve of mine: people, mainly women, who when the check-out person tells them that's going to be \u00a332.75, look startled. Finally they recover from their daze, open a cavernous shopping bag, pull out a handbag, extract a purse, and then with great care unpick a tight roll of banknotes, until you want to say, \"Look, you idiot, surely you didn't imagine this was free?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
