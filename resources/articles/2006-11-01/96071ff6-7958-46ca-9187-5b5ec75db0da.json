That is the question police and public must be asking themselves in the light of three incidents to have emerged this week in Los Angeles. Forget police oversight commissions and the bulky, lethargic bureaucracy of officialdom. YouTube is up and running faster than a cop with a primed Taser, and it makes embarrassing viewing for Los Angeles law enforcement in all its guises. Last week videos were posted on YouTube showing the arrest by two LAPD officers of William Cardenas in August. One officer sits astride Cardenas, who is lying on his back, while another punches him. Cardenas can be heard repeatedly saying, \"I can't breath.\" On Monday a video appeared showing a man being arrested at Venice beach, near Los Angeles. A LAPD officer places the handcuffed man inside a squad car, leans in to apply pepper spray to the man's face then closes the door. The officer subsequently left the force. The latest case involves a young man, a university library and a Taser. Posted on YouTube on Wednesday, the video was shot on a mobile phone. It opens with a shaky moving shot of a computer keyboard and voice in the background shouting \"Don't touch me\". Shot at 11.30pm at University of California Los Angeles's Powell Library, the camera wobbles and jinks around as the shouting continues. Bemused students look up from their keyboards as the tumult grows. But this is no everyday incident of restless academia. Thirty seconds into the clip, the man screams. Another voice tells him to \"Get up\" as his screams continue. The camera weaves its way to the action, catching a gaggle of onlookers gathered around the library entrance. \"Here's your Patriot Act. Here's your fucking abuse of power,\" says the man as the other voice - presumably a University of California Police Department officer - continues to tell him to get up. \"Stop fighting us,\" says the officer. \"I'm not fighting you,\" says the man. \"I said I was leaving. I got Tasered for no reason. I was leaving this god-forsaken place.\" An onlooker asks the officer for his badge number, but receives no response. Several officers now stand around the man. \"Stand up or you'll get Tasered again,\" they tell him. They haul him to his feet and administer another charge. The man again screams. And so it goes on. The officers repeatedly Tasering the man, the soundtrack dominated by his screams and the persistent mechanical voice of the police telling him to stand up even as they administer more charges. As the growing crowd of onlookers gets closer, the officers warn them to stay away or risk being Tasered themselves. Subsequent enquiries reveal that a community service officer approached the man in the library asking for his student identification. He refused to show it. When the officer returned with campus police the man, according to witnesses, was leaving the library. An officer allegedly grabbed his arm at which point he began saying \"Don't touch me.\" The man, who was identified as a 23-year-old Iranian-American student named Mostafa Tabatabainejad, was arrested and cited for resisting arrest and obstructing a police officer. If it weren't for the video this might be another humdrum case of a rowdy student. But the video and the way it is distributed make it far more disturbing. Although the picture is incomplete, it is hard to characterise the officers' actions as reasonable. But much more interesting is that we get to see the video. Home videos of police excess have been around for a long time - it is 14 years since the Rodney King video sparked the 1992 riots - but the means to distribute them to a mass audience has previously been in the hands of corporate media. That has now changed. Three YouTube hits in a week is bad news for a law enforcement community that has been grappling for years with its reputation for heavy-handedness. LAPD chief William Bratton has sounded by turns contrite and combative, promising an enquiry into the first incident (the FBI is also looking into the arrest) while insisting that \"Police work is never pretty, particularly when you have people resisting arrest.\" Back at UCLA, the campus police are collecting evidence. \"We will gather as many samples as we can find, from different sources,\" an official told the LA Times. \"We'll use it for our own administrative investigation.\" If that sounds like a promise to adopt the old routine of sweeping an investigation under the carpet, home video has the upper hand. In the YouTube video of the UCLA incident, there are occasional glimpses of other students holding their mobile phones up to record the action. Reality has been brought to book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
