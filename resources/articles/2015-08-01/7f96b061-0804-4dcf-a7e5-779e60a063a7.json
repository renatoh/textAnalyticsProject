The only three-year-old in this small field, he seems sure to start at odds-on but a search for value alternatives does not appeal. While his rivals have shown that they belong at this level or slightly below, Kodi Bear seems a Group One horse in waiting. Indeed he has already performed with credit at that level when second in last year\u2019s Dewhurst, albeit in what now looks a poor renewal. There were excuses for his fourth-placed effort when tried in a French Group One this summer, notably the fact that he got involved in a debilitating pace battle with rivals who finished much further back. His latest performance, landing a Group Three at Salisbury, was astonishing. Not only did he stuff a useful field by four lengths, he did it after veering wildly across the track, having belatedly realised that the rest had tacked over to the stands\u2019 side. Goodwood is expected to dry out before today\u2019s action but he copes well with some cut in any case. The main concern would be an early failure to settle but in G\u00e9rald Moss\u00e9 he has a top-class rider who should be able to help. 2.00 Goodwood This is highly competitive but Fireglow has the strongest credentials after a close second in what appeared a strong Sweet Solera recently. Her form with Dessertoflife suggests she may not have much in hand over Epsom Icon but she has a better draw and a better chance of getting the run of this. 2.20 Beverley Maarek is the best of these at his peak but drying ground is no good to him and he may have trouble threading his way through for his usual strong finish. Line Of Reason is more suited to these conditions and has been steadily progressive over two years. His strong-finishing fourth behind Muthmir at Goodwood makes him the pick here. 2.35 Goodwood Magic City has a fine record at this track and specifically in this race, which he won in 2013 and in which he was third from a rotten draw last year. He had a similarly poor draw when in midfield at the Glorious meeting last month but that was a good effort on his first start since February and he is still well enough treated to win another of these when things fall right. Stall nine is OK for a hold-up horse and some juice in the ground should give him a bit more time to close down the leaders in the home straight. 2.50 Newmarket Having been highly tried, Magic Dancer found luck in running did not come his way on his handicap debut here last time. But he responded well to the first-time blinkers and to the presence in the saddle of the useful apprentice Patrick O\u2019Donnell, both retained here, and can do much better with a clear run. He was second in a modest renewal of the Lingfield Derby Trial back in May and this three-year-old has more to offer. 3.10 Goodwood There is a slight concern about Fun Mac that this season may follow the pattern of the last one, starting with an exciting performance which he does not reproduce. But, having hosed up at Salisbury in May, he was beaten just half a length by a Willie Mullins-trained rival at Royal Ascot, and was fancied for last week\u2019s Ebor before being withdrawn at the start on vet\u2019s advice. Some give underfoot is no problem. 3.25 Newmarket This has been a frustrating year for Polybius, who got short-headed at Doncaster last time, but the ability is there and he could be worth chancing in what does not look a strong listed contest. This may be the softest surface he has encountered but his breeding suggests he should cope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
