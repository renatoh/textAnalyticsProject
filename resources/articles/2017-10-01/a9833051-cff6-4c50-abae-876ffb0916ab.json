The airline had to scrap the bookings of more than 700,000 passengers last month due to an apparent shortage of pilots, having failed to plan for enough leave for staff. Ryanair hoped a bonus payment could entice some pilots to change their holiday plans, but O\u2019Leary then further inflamed the situation with disparaging comments about pilots at the airline\u2019s annual meeting in Dublin. On Thursday, the outspoken boss sent an extraordinarily contrite letter to pilots at the airline \u201cto apologise personally to each of you for the disruptions you have experienced\u201d. O\u2019Leary had accused pilots of being \u201cprecious about themselves\u201d and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d, adding: \u201cI would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked, or how anybody who by law can\u2019t fly more than 18 hours a week could possibly be suffering from fatigue.\u201d He said that the comments had been directed at \u201cpilots of competitor airlines and their unions\u201d, a favoured refrain of O\u2019Leary\u2019s when addressing those who have criticised his employment model. \u201cI have the utmost respect and admiration for Ryanair\u2019s pilot team,\u201d he said. The letter offered a range of improvements to terms and conditions, including salary increases, loyalty bonus payments, improved rostering and better compensation for those pilots forced into working away from their home base. But it warned pilots against taking alternative employment with other airlines, particularly Norwegian, where hundreds are thought to have decamped. A graph of his rival airline\u2019s tumbling share price, along with some choice financial facts, was appended to the letter. O\u2019Leary warned earlier this year that Monarch, which collapsed into administration this week, and Norwegian would not survive the winter. The letter, however, showed that the airline\u2019s management is extremely conscious of the extent of pilot anger. O\u2019Leary warned that he would stick with Ryanair\u2019s \u201cemployee representative committees\u201d, the forums it claims do the job of unions, which it refuses to recognise. He said the committees would be the only way to negotiate better pay and warned pilots \u201cyou and your colleagues will suffer\u201d if they were ignored. Pilots around Europe are unofficially organising, with many seeking union recognition. Ryanair staff in the UK hope to come together to halt its practice of negotiating individual deals with bases. A number of pilots remain under tax investigation after working for Ryanair through one of its intermediaries, which instructed them to form companies as effective self-employed contractors \u2013 a practice which has attracted the attention of authorities around Europe. About half of Ryanair pilots are not officially employed by the airline. The Civil Aviation Authority has pledged to monitor Ryanair\u2019s treatment of passengers in the wake of the mass flight cancellations, after giving it an ultimatum to finally inform disappointed customers of their full rights or face legal action. \u2022 This article has been amended to correct a misspelling of \u201cjibes\u201d in the headline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
