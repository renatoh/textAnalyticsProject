At its meeting in Washington, the G7 backed proposals tabled yesterday by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for measures to tackle the recent instability in the global energy markets. \"Oil prices remain high and are a risk\", the G7 commmunique said. \"So we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices remain moderate. \"Second it is important consumer nations increase energy efficiency. Third it is important for consumers and producers that oil markets function efficiently and we encourage the International Energy Agency to enhance its work on oil data transparency.\" The G7 call broadly followed a four-point plan outlined by Mr Brown to deal with the threat. The chancellor called on Opec, the producers' cartel, to pump more oil. He also said the market needed better information about oil supplies, higher investment in new fields and all countries should push for greater energy efficiency. \"A global recovery is under way with growth stronger over the past year, but it remains uneven and still fragile,\" Mr Brown said. \"High and volatile oil prices pose a risk to the outlook, dampening consumer spending and company profitability. Mr Brown also brushed aside comments by the International Monetary Fund earlier this week about the fragility of the UK housing market and the need for the government to raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit. \"They [the IMF] are out of date,\" he said. The housing market had changed since the spring and the spending round in July had produced new fiscal forecasts for the years up to 2008. \"I don't think that's been taken into account.\" The chancellor said the fluctuations in the oil price between $10 a barrel and $50 a barrel in the past few years meant there was an urgent need to take both short-term and medium-term measures to make the market work more effectively. Despite the agreement by Opec to increase production, Mr Brown said it needed to do more. \"Opec must continue to take the necessary action to return oil prices to levels consistent with global prosperity.\" Opec countries have made it clear that they lack the spare capacity to respond to western calls for an increase in supply, blaming speculators for the doubling of the oil price since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in spring 2003. The chancellor said the answer to speculation was more and better information. \"A lack of transparency in oil markets and poor-quality information contributes to volatility and uncertainties. The Treasury proposals would see consuming nations and producers work together to devise a phased timetable for producing transparent, high-quality, timely and reliable oil market data, available to all. The World Bank and the IMF should have an enhanced role in encouraging \"better and more timely data\", Mr Brown said. The IMF said this week that lack of supply meant high oil prices were likely to persist for the rest of the decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
