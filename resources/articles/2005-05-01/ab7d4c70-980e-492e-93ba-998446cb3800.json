The deputy prime minister pays tributes to his local activists, as \"it was the Labour party that won it, nobody else\". \"It is quite a historic night for the Labour party,\" he adds. David Blunkett also refers to the Labour's \"historic third term\" in his acceptance speech in Sheffield Brightside. On the swing against the party, he merely says that \"it is not surprising that normal politics returns\". \"Tony Blair led us out of the wilderness and will continue to lead us,\" he adds defiantly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
