The company\u2019s shares fell 5% in after-hours trading as it released its latest quarterly results and a forecast for the coming quarter that fell below analysts\u2019 expectations. Yahoo reported revenue of $1.26bn for the fourth quarter of 2013, a 6% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2012. Display advertising revenue was $553m for the fourth quarter of 2013, a 6% decrease compared with $591m for the fourth quarter of 2012. Profits rose to $348.2m up from $272.3m a year earlier. Yahoo said it expected current-quarter net income of between $130m-$170m, well below forecasts. Eighteen months after former Google executive Marissa Mayer was appointed to turn around the struggling company, analysts said a lot of questions still remained. The company has been attempting to reinvigorate its display advertising business and last year appointed former CBS news host Katie Couric as its \"global anchor\". The company has also been on a spending spree, snapping up 23 companies under Mayer\u2019s tenure including Tumblr, the picture blogging site, for which it paid $1.1bn last May. Colin Gillis, internet analyst at BGC Partners, said: \u201cIt\u2019s still a business that\u2019s in decline despite all the talk of a turnaround. Display fell 6% in the fourth quarter, which is supposed to be a good quarter for display ads.\u201d Gillis said many investors now held Yahoo because of its stake in Alibaba, China\u2019s internet giant, and Yahoo Japan. \u201cAll of these efforts are not translating into revenue growth. More of its income comes from equity investments [in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan] than the core business,\u201d he said. Mayer said: \"I'm encouraged by Yahoo's performance in quarter four and 2013 overall. We saw continued stability in the business, and our investments allowed us to bring beautiful products to our users and establish a strong foundation for revenue growth.\u201d \u201cWe are extremely heartened by the year-over-year traffic increase we experienced in 2013, an early sign of return on our investments and the acquisitions we've made,\" she said. The company\u2019s share slide echoed a similar fall for Apple, which released its quarterly results on Monday. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s shares hit their lowest point in three months after disappointing iPhone sales raised concerns about the firm's growth prospects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
