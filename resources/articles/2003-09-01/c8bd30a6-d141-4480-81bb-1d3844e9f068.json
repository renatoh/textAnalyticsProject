Fort Augustus Abbey, a Grade A-listed former Benedictine monastery and school on the banks of Loch Ness, is to be sold for the second time in less than five months when it goes under the hammer on 16 October . More than 500 locals have formed the Fort Augustus Abbey Preservation Trust to try to buy the abbey, which has a guide price of \u00a31 million. The trust has applied for funding from the Scottish Land Fund, a lottery- sponsored organisation which supported community buyouts in Anagach Wood, Strathspey, and on the Isle of Gigha. It has \u00a310m available to help communities buy and manage local land and assets, but has told the trust it must first find backers to fund the restoration and ongoing management costs of the abbey. John Watt, of the Strengthening Communities Group in Highlands and Island Enterprise, the government body that administers the Scottish Land Fund, says restoration work on the building, estimated to cost between \u00a34m and \u00a35m, would be extremely difficult for the community to man age without cash-rich business partners. Other Scottish communities that have bought estates have tended to retain the land but sell on buildings that are expensive to maintain. 'We've been working closely with the community, says Watt, 'and see a need for partnership between the community and private developers to contribute to the costs and develop the asset once it's acquired. We've made some progress, but time is very short.' Mel Stewardson, chairman of the trust, says villagers have been in a Catch 22 position up to now. 'The organisations, such as Historic Scotland, that might help fund the restoration and become involved with running the abbey say they can't promise any money until we own the property.' Set in 22 acres of woodland, the 300-year-old abbey stands on the site of a Hanoverian fort built to quell the Jacobites. Stewardson believes the abbey could be converted to a combination of private holiday accommodation and a visitor centre, supplying information about the abbey and the surrounding area. The abbey fronts on to Loch Ness, and could become one of just a handful of places the public can access from the loch. Urquhart Castle, also on the shore of Loch Ness, attracts about 200,000 visitors a year. Historic Scotland opened a \u00a35m visitor centre and a road extension at the castle last November. The trust was in negotiation to buy the abbey for \u00a3775,000 from the previous owner, Terry Nutkins, former presenter of BBC TV's The Really Wild Show . He had planned to turn it into a tourist attraction, com plete with a glass underwater tunnel for viewing brown trout. But Nutkins pulled out of the deal just two days before they were due to complete, and sold the abbey at auction in June for \u00a3850,000. The current owner, Brendan Kiely, bought the abbey without even seeing it. \u00b7 Contact the trust on 01320 366678 or visit its website www.theabbeytrust.co.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
