Hitherto the selectors have not come calling but, if they are haunted by those five Test failures and an average of 13 against South Africa in 1999, Adams is not. Self-belief oozes out of his swagger - a couple of weeks ago he informed readers of the Brighton Argus that he and his team-mate James Kirtley should be in the World Cup squad and not Nasser Hussain. Tact has never been Adams's strongest point, but he can still bat. And as the Manchester sky gloamed between slate and charcoal to late evening gold, he lit up his bat and smoked on, and on, for 105 overs and 159 runs driving Lancashire's enthusiastic attack into the distance. This wasn't Adams at his most belligerent, he received some treatment on his calf and there was a mid-innings lull as he took 141 balls to get from 50 to 100, but his arms retain that intense power. There were two toppling sixes off Gary Keedy, a pillbox full of trademark pulls and staccato cover-drives in an instant with a dip of the head. And he retains the most disdainful stare in first-class cricket, should a bowler attempt to bounce him out or appeal for something, anything. At the other end his partners came, and went, with stays of various length and success. From a cameo from Tony Cottey, who could just about stare at Adams's bull neck if he stood on tip-toes, to Robin Martin-Jenkins who towers above him and took control during a fifth-wicket partnership of 79. Again it was Kyle Hogg who was Lancashire's most dangerous bowler, finishing with three for 38. Loose-limbed, he speared Murray Goodwin lbw with his first ball. He destroyed Cottey's stumps before lunch and after tea beat Matt Prior for pace as he hit out to midwicket. Keedy's marathon 34-over day had some light relief with the removal of Mike Yardy's and Martin-Jenkins' stumps. Chris Schofield, peroxide highlights almost flourescent, eased gently into his first Championship bowl of the season. Warren Hegg, standing next to fellow international discard Stuart Law at first slip, did what he does best, taking a fantastic diving one-handed catch to dismiss Richard Montgomerie. And, despite his less than respectful treatment by England, he hasn't forgotten his manners. As Adams strode past 150 with his 18th four, he stood behind the stumps and applauded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
