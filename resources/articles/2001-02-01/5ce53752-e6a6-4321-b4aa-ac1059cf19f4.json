Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays (0870 3332001) is offering one-week holidays there at the Residence Cheval Blanc, starting on April 14, from \u00a399 per person. Like all these headline-grabbing deals, this one is based on maximum occupancy of a self-catering apartment sleeping five people. For those wanting a bit more elbow room, simply divide the apartment rental of \u00a3496 by the number of people sharing. The price includes Channel tunnel crossings for a car and passengers. Val Thorens is part of the Trois Vall\u00e9es ski area and is connected - though linking pistes are sometimes icy on spring mornings - with resorts including M\u00e9ribel and Courchevel. Still on the theme of Easter skiing, tour operator First Choice (0870 7543477) says it has relatively few flight seats left but can easily find beds for customers prepared to drive to the Alps. Most availability is for one week from Good Friday or Easter Saturday. It has holidays starting on April 13 in a variety of French resorts including Les Deux Alpes (from \u00a3399), Val d'Is\u00e8re (from \u00a3409) and Alpe d'Huez (from \u00a3449). Some space is still available to these resorts from Gatwick, Manchester and Belfast. And it can offer packages with departures the following day to resorts such as Tignes (from \u00a3489) Les Arcs (from \u00a3259), M\u00e9ribel (from \u00a3399) and Courchevel (from \u00a3409). Late-season skiers seeking cheap flights to the Alps should note that easyJet will switch its Stansted-Geneva service to Gatwick next month. The airline will continue to fly to the Swiss city from Luton. It already operates one daily flight there from Gatwick. From March 25, it will offer two flights a day. Meanwhile, stand by for another round of competitive fares to Colorado next winter. On the same date Lufthansa will launch a new service from Frankfurt to Denver. How aware are skiers and snowboarders of the danger of skin cancer? Experts in the US have launched research aimed at finding out. Clear air and the reflection of sunlight from snow intensify the effect of ultra-violet radiation on all slopes, but in the Rockies and other western mountain ranges the problem is particularly acute because most resorts there are very high. Researchers from the Denver-based American Medical Centre have been riding with visitors on chairlifts in 28 resorts this season and quizzing them on their knowledge. They are asking, for example, how easily they burn, and whether they have used sunscreen. Next season the centre will launch an awareness campaign in one resort, yet to be chosen, and compare the results with one in which no such action has been taken. Anyone still skiing in the Austrian resort of Ischgl on April 30 will almost certainly be flirting with ice and slush - but the compensation will be a free concert by Sting. It starts at 1pm at Idalp, described as \"a natural amphitheatre\" at over 7,000ft. All you need do to hear him is buy a lift pass, which is included in some special local deals at that time. Four nights' bed and breakfast between April 27 and May 1 costs from around \u00a3150.
