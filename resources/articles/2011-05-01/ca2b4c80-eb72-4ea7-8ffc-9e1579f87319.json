Flashman and the prime minister", "bodyText": "There's been some rum talk in recent days of a squirt called David Cameron matching up to Harry Flashman. The cheek, I say! Only this week at prime minister's question time \u2013 still the same old nonsense, never changes, not since Gladstone's day \u2013 that young chap Edward Miliband announced \"Flashman is back\". Well, how do you think Flashy felt about that? This Cameron has pink cheeks, slick hair and I'd bet two shillings to the pound he's never been further east than Calais. I know the type \u2013 seen it all before \u2013 costly school, well-connected friends, stuffed full of prim nonsense about the nobility of society and now, just because he cracked some damn-fool joke in the House of Commons, everyone thinks he's a proper bully. I know a man when I see one and that Cameron has never run away from a fight over the hills of Kandahar and it's an insult to Flashy to suggest I'm anything like him. I've half a mind to search out young Miliband and trounce him (I served his older brother once, out in Kabul during the Helmand campaign, and know that family always ducks a challenge). No doubt I'm uncharitable, but Westminster seems to be run by a gang of chaps without hair on their chin who've never done a hard day's work in their life. I say to hell with the lot of them \u2013 though there is one, the Hon Gideon George Osborne, who's more my type, got a spark in his eyes, out for what he can get. If there's a Flashman among all of them in the Commons, it's him. Yours etc, Harry Flashman"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
