The Kilshaw family and Flintshire council: Alan and Judith Kilshaw have promised to fight the decision by Flintshire council's social services department to take the twins into care. They may get their first chance to do so before the end of next week. Although there is some confusion about the legal basis of Flintshire's intervention it is known that they used the Children Act 1989. This makes it likely the council has just eight days before its social workers have to appear in court and present the case for an interim care order which will allow them to keep the children in care. All other interested parties, including Richard and Vickie Allen - the US couple who also \"bought\" the twins - and the birth mother Tranda Wecker, can be represented at this hearing. The minimum duration of the care order is 28 days, after which the council has to re-apply to the courts. The UK government: At prime minister's question time yesterday, Tony Blair disclosed that the government planned to press ahead with new adoption laws in the current parliamentary session. Legislation has been in place since 1999 that could prevent a repeat of the Kilshaw affair, but the prime minister admitted that regulations enforcing this law will not come into force until \"later this year\". But the list of Commons business for the coming two weeks unveiled yesterday makes no mention of any adoption legislation. The Arkansas authorities: The Kilshaws could face a legal battle in the state whose liberal adoption laws they used to adopt internet twins Belinda and Kimberly. An Arkansas judge says legal action is likely, and that it could invalidate the Kilshaws' claim to the children. Judge Ellen Brantley said: \"From what I have read about this case, it makes me uncomfortable on a number of different levels, professionally as well as personally.\" Tranda Wecker: The twins' birth mother says she wants her children back, but could face prosecution for perjury if she seeks to do so through the Arkansas courts. Parents who give their children up for adoption must have lived in the state for at least 30 days, and there have been suggestions that Ms Wecker did not fulfil that qualification. If she did not, this would render the adoption itself invalid. The Allen family: Richard and Vickie Allen claim they were duped into handing back the twins after caring for them for two months. They have extended their sympathies to the Kilshaws, with Mrs Allen saying: \"I've got nothing against them.\" They have repeatedly offered the twins \"a good home\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
