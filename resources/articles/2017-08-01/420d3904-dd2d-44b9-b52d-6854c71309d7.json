The number of offenders on probation charged with murder, manslaughter, rape and other serious violent or sexual crimes has risen by more than 25% since changes to the service in England and Wales. Plaid Cymru, which obtained the figures, said the trend was \u201cextremely worrying\u201d and called for the government to renationalise the probation service. The party also found that offenders in many parts of England and Wales are reporting to the new private-sector community rehabilitation companies (CRC), which are responsible for supervising offenders judged to be of low or medium risk, via phone call rather than in person. The government played down the figures, saying that since the reforms many more offenders are supervised in the community after leaving prison, which makes an accurate comparison of the before and after pictures impossible. It said reporting via phone was just one technique used by CRCs. According to the figures, in 2012-13 \u2013 before privatisation \u2013 409 serious further offence reviews were triggered. By 2016-17, the number of SFOs had increased to 517. The figures also show that between February 2015 and the end of 2016, 46 offenders were convicted of murder while subject to supervision by a CRC. This is likely to rise as a number of other cases are still going through the legal process. Plaid Cymru\u2019s justice spokesperson, the MP Liz Saville Roberts, said: \u201cThis is an extremely worrying rise in serious crime committed by people who are supposedly under supervision. These are offenders who, under the supervision of the probation service, committed murder, manslaughter, rape or another serious violent or sexual offence. \u201cThat the number of instances of this kind has surged by 26% since the probation service was privatised is deeply worrying. The British government needs to admit it was wrong and commit to renationalising the probation service.\u201d The justice secretary, David Lidington, said last month that the privatised probation service had encountered \u201cunforeseen challenges\u201d. Saville Roberts drew attention to leaked documents, first published by the Guardian in 2013, warning that there was a more than 80% risk that the proposals introduced by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling, would lead to \u201can unacceptable drop in operational performance\u201d triggering \u201cdelivery failures and reputational damage\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is astonishing that ministers are claiming the difficulties faced since privatisation were unforeseen when a leaked internal risk management document shows that they were warned.\u201d Harry Fletcher, a justice campaigner and former probation worker, said: \u201cThat the justice secretary claims that problems with the sell-off of the probation service were unforeseen is astonishing. The leaked risk assessment from 2013 was damning and warned about these problems but the British government ignored it.\u201d Under the changes to the service, the caseload was divided between the public sector National Probation Service \u2013 which took on higher-risk offenders \u2013 and 21 CRCs. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cIn 2014, we reformed our approach to probation so that for the first time ever, all offenders given a custodial sentence receive probation support and supervision on release. \u201cIt is therefore misleading to compare the number of Serious Further Offences prior to our reforms with subsequent figures, as the number of people on probation is now significantly higher than before. \u201cA thorough investigation is always carried out when someone commits a serious further offence to see whether anything could have been done differently.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
