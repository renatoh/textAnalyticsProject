The longtime cricketer turned longtime commentator was on Good Morning Britain this week, when he was asked about his Brexit strategy, rather in the same way you might get Jeremy Hunt on the show and seek his opinion as to whether he can even bear the poignancy of not being able to watch Jimmy Anderson in World Cup conditions like these. Having immediately attempted to flirt with Susanna Reid with the same gossamer touch you\u2019d expect of a man convicted of a brutal assault on a former partner, Boycott moved into other arenas of incompetence. Of most perplexing note was his carefree enthusiasm for the UK exiting the European Union without a deal. \u201cWe fought two world wars and we came out on top,\u201d analysed Boycott. \u201cWhy? Because of the spirit and determination of the British people. That\u2019s what the British people do \u2026 we\u2019re a strong people. We\u2019ll survive!\u201d Yes! Have it! Such a relief to hear someone saying we should just get out there and smash it and not agonise at length over the consequences of how we play it lest anything ends up going wrong. What\u2019s the worst that can happen, and so forth. On the other hand: who on earth is this devil\u2011may\u2011care adventurer, this fast-and-loose buccaneer, this cricketing personality type simply made to get the foam fingers wagging appreciatively at the Big Bash? Can it really be Geoff Boycott? I think it\u2019s the sheer cavalier abandon that makes you wonder what might have been. Back in the day, it often felt to cricket watchers as though Boycott was in for an entire summer, every time he was in, inching defensively and absolutely without apology toward the low 20s by lunch. \u201cIt was more of an occupation than an innings,\u201d the Times\u2019s John Woodcock wrote witheringly of one such anti-spectacle, an innings on the first day of which Boycott went a full 45 minutes without scoring, among various other lowlights. But will you just look at how he Brexits! By the seat of his actual pants. Without pants, if necessary. If only Boycott\u2019s future self could have written one of those letters to his 27-year-old self. \u201cCome on Geoffrey, my lad,\u201d this might have run. \u201cI know that right now you think people have paid their money to see you and you\u2019re keen to treat that investment with the utmost contempt, ideally by blocking your way to a joyless 50 by close of play, which will have the joint effect of letting the England selectors see exactly how you feel about their pointed call for \u2018brighter cricket\u2019. I know that right now you value being boring, technically faultless and incredibly reliable as virtues. I know you make no apologies for taking obsessive amounts of care. But listen: we won two world wars \u2013 and by the time you get to the age of 78, you\u2019re going to be one of those weirdo subclinical nostalgics who somehow reckons they actually fought in them. Let\u2019s have a bit of flair! Let\u2019s have a bit of fuck-this-for-a-game-of-soldiers! Let\u2019s have a sense of adventure and hang the consequences! I\u2019m sure you can see the long-term folly of thinking everything through as much as you do \u2026\u201d Well, you get the idea with that one. It\u2019s notable that we now live in times where Boycott is lionised by some as an amusing character who\u2019d do a much better job than the politicians and so on and so on. After all, the great consensus in the old days was that Boycott knew very little about entertainment and even less about leadership. The latter quality was in particularly short supply. Of Boycott\u2019s brief England captaincy, Mike Brearley \u2013 who famously had it in spades \u2013 said: \u201cWhen he took over after I broke my arm, [Boycott] won little except the recognition he was not the man to captain England.\u201d That was the polite way of putting it; Ian Botham made a similar point by running Boycott out during the second Test between New Zealand and England in 1978, ending another unspeakably glacial innings. \u201cWhat have you done? What have you done?\u201d Boycott demanded sotto voce of Botham, who likes to say that he replied: \u201cI\u2019ve run you out, you cunt.\u201d Strange, even in the mad post-referendum world, to think the often haplessly self-centred Boycott is now regarded as a thought leader of sorts. This latest tirade is far from the first inkling of how post-Boycott Boycott would differ from Boycott-era Boycott. The writer Tim de Lisle once observed that Ian Botham and Boycott swapped roles in retirement. Despite having been the great showman, Botham\u2019s commentary was plodding and dreary, while the previously dour Boycott insisted on whacking every point around the ground. Yet even accounting for this, I am not sure that the fabled disinhibition of old age is what lies behind Boycott\u2019s political vision for the UK as delineated on GMB this week. In fact, it is rather easier to see his whole career as being of a coherent piece when you remember it is all underpinned by the same inability to think much \u2013 or indeed anywhere \u2013 beyond what suits himself. Boycott says exactly what he pleases as long as it won\u2019t be him getting caught out by the effects of his pronouncements. And he personally would be fine in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Yes, Geoffrey Boycott is simply looking after Geoffrey Boycott. It really was ever thus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
