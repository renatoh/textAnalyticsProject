Ellis, who will be 82 in January and has presided over 13 managers during two separate spells as chairman at Villa Park, returned to work full-time last month after recuperating from a successful six-hour operation. The octogenarian claims to have lost two stone since he was admitted to Edgbaston Priory, where he learned of the seriousness of his health problems. \"The surgeon said that I had three options,\" said Ellis. One was to treat the condition with medicine; the second was surgery, with a much higher prospect of success. \"'However,' he said, 'there is an alternative.' I said, 'What's that?' He said: 'I could do nothing but you'll be dead in six months.' So there was no option, was there? Was I frightened? Naturally. Did that make me think about the future? Of course. It was serious. But I wouldn't leave Aston Villa. That's my home.\" Djibril Ciss\u00e9 yesterday admitted assaulting a 15-year-old boy.
