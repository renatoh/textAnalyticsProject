Curtis, the world number 396 from Ohio, fired a final-round 69 for a one-under-par total of 283, holding off some of the world's best players in the process. The 26-year-old US Tour rookie, playing his first ever major, took advantage of a late collapse from overnight leader Thomas Bjorn to get his hands on the famous Claret Jug and \u00a3700,000 first prize. Bjorn was two shots clear with three holes to play but took three shots to escape from a bunker on the 16th, the ball twice rolling back down to his feet after failing to climb the slope to the flag. The Ryder Cup Dane then topped his second shot to the 17th and failed to save par before narrowly missing chipping in for birdie on the last to force a play-off. Bjorn, who was also penalised two shots in his first round for hitting the sand with his club after failing to escape from a bunker on the 17th at the first attempt, finished in a tie for second on level par with Fiji's Vijay Singh, world number one Tiger Woods a shot further back alongside Davis Love. Defending champion Ernie Els finished seven shots off the pace on six over. Curtis said he had told his fiancee last night he intended to go out and win the championship today. And after accepting the famous old trophy, he told the galleries: \"Oh my! I come from Kent, Ohio so you made me feel right at home.\" The American struggled to hold back tears of joy as he thanked his family and fiancee Candice, and then told the BBC \"it's already starting\" when asked if the enormity of what he had just done had begun to sink in. \"I will wake up tomorrow a different man,\" he said. \"It's unbelievable. \"I set out there to win, that's what I wanted to do; that's what I told Candice and everybody else. \"It's a whole new level, up there with the elite - I am looking forward to it.\" His success was down to \"just being patient\" he said, adding: \"I set out there at the beginning of the week to take the bounces and what the course gives you, just keep fighting. \"It's the grandest tournament of all and I am very fortunate to be the winner along with great names like Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan - all those great names, I am very fortunate to be on that list.\" A deflated Bjorn admitted: \"I am obviously disappointed because I thought I did all the right things all day long. \"It was an expensive mistake. I lost the Open on the 16th hole - but you live with it. I stood on that 15th with one hand on the trophy. Hopefully there will be a major coming my way very soon.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
