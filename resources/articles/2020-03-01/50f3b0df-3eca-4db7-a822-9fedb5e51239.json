As national sporting organisations were busily complying with a directive to shut down training centres and other facilities, their chief executives on Monday received notification of an extraordinary Australian Olympic Committee board meeting. They were invited to join a late-morning teleconference, where the news was delivered: Australia would cease preparations for a 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was unexpected,\u201d said Jacco Verhaeren, Swimming Australia\u2019s head coach, before the Games were officially postponed. \u201cThis is the right thing to do right now, but it is still a tough message \u2013 particularly for our athletes and coaches who have been working for years to get to this point.\u201d Cycling Australia\u2019s performance director Simon Jones was at the velodrome in Adelaide with his sprint riders, as they completed a final, social-distancing compliant training session before the arena shuts indefinitely. The AOC had written directly to all athletes on the Olympic selection long-list, but these riders had not yet seen their emails; Jones had to break the news. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock,\u201d said Jones. \u201cYou have to let people absorb the information.\u201d The team had already been hit hard by the news last week that a staff member was in hospital with coronavirus. Annette Edmondson, an endurance rider in Jones\u2019 squad, had woken on Monday to the latest international developments before setting out for a morning ride. \u201cThe scenario has been changing so quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe went for a bike ride in the morning, and by the end of it more international news was trickling through. By the time the official announcement came, we were already 90% sure it was coming.\u201d Just six days ago, Edmondson and 14 colleagues had been selected for Tokyo. \u201cMonday was an interesting day \u2013 it is going to take time to process,\u201d she said. The AOC\u2019s withdrawal pre-empted the official postponement of Tokyo 2020 by the International Olympic Committee, announced late on Tuesday. With the coronavirus\u2019s disruption growing by the day, the AOC had not been prepared to wait. \u201cIt is a big call, but it puts the safety of athletes and staff as the number one priority,\u201d said Jones. With a July Olympics off the table, training camps scrapped, facilities closed and athletes homebound, Australia\u2019s Olympic sports have three priorities. The first is athlete wellbeing. \u201cIt will become emotional \u2013 in the next few hours, days, weeks and months,\u201d said Verhaeren. \u201cPeople have seen their goals disappear. We are focusing on providing immediate care for those who need it.\u201d Cycling Australia has a full-time performance psychologist on staff and a dedicated athlete wellbeing officer. \u201cAthletes are in a range of positions,\u201d said Edmondson. \u201cWe have young riders coming into the team for the first time \u2013 a one-year delay will affect them, but not significantly. Whereas older athletes, myself included, we are coming to the end of our span. I was already contemplating that this could be my last major event. The idea that to get to the Games could take 12 months more than expected really threw me.\u201d Beyond initial concern for athletes, Australia\u2019s major Olympic sports are also looking to their balance sheets \u2013 and wondering how a 12-month delay will impact funding, which is determined on an annual basis. \u201cIt is very difficult to answer that,\u201d said Jones, who is in close contact with the Australian Institute of Sport. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any answers at the moment, but we know people are working quickly on those sorts of questions.\u201d While these sports are dependent on government funding, which may be at risk in a straitened economic climate, their business models are also protected from the sudden suspension of spectator sport. \u201cOur budget is not reliant on ticket sales,\u201d said Swimming Australia chief executive Leigh Russell. \u201cSome of the pain that other sports are experiencing right now is because they are heavily reliant on people transacting with a club or the sport. We are in a different situation, but a very unknown one. There are lots of moving pieces right now.\u201d Finally, with the postponed Olympics likely to take place in July-August 2021, athletes and coaches must reset their countdown and plan for 16 months\u2019 time. \u201cOnce we are through this, we\u2019re going to need to ramp up pretty quickly, both from a performance perspective and behind the scenes,\u201d said Russell. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose the momentum we have, even if it needs to be put on pause right now.\u201d Given the ongoing uncertainty, those plans may take some time to shape up. Amid global panic over the coronavirus pandemic, Olympic athletes are trying to take it in their stride. \u201cAt the end of the day we\u2019re just a sport,\u201d said Edmondson, a three-time world champion and London 2012 bronze medallist. \u201cWhat we do is important to us. But when you hear the figures of people affected, the people dying, that puts it in perspective. A postponed Olympics is not the end of the world for us. But this situation will be pretty serious for many, many others.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
