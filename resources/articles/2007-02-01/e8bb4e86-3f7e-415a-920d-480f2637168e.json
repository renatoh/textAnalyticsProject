After completing its first public value test (PVT) of a proposed new service, the BBC Trust announced that the corporation could start offering on-demand TV downloads through its new \"iPlayer\". The BBC management appears to have got most of what it asked for - but seeking to demonstrate its independence, the trust turned down certain aspects of the proposal. So far so good. But when you look a little deeper all is not quite as it appears, and in some respects the process would appear to have worked against the public interest it was designed to promote. The most obvious difference between what was asked for, and what was granted, relates to the length of time a downloaded programme can be kept on a viewer's computer. Management wanted 13 weeks, but the trust gave permission only for 30 days. The ambitions of BBC executives were also curbed in another iPlayer function known as \"series stacking\": this enables users to download and view any previously transmitted episode of a series while later episodes are still on air. In line with Ofcom's market impact assessment, the trust decided the potential impact of these services on the emerging commercial downloads market and on the existing market in DVD/video rentals and sales was too much to bear. Ofcom's assessment was based mainly on submissions by commercial \"stakeholders\". Their principal objection was that people might be less likely to use paid-for services if the volume of \"free\" material from the BBC was too high. Sounds logical enough - but is there any evidence for this? It turns out that nobody knows for sure. As with so much of this particular public value test - concerned as it is with a new service some way ahead of anything else in the market - firm evidence is thin on the ground. Leaving aside this uncertainty, licence payers have definitely lost out in another way. For months, the BBC negotiated with Pact, the independent producers' trade body, to agree terms of trade that would allow the corporation to offer the aforementioned 13-week download window. In the course of those negotiations, the BBC made a number of important concessions. In order to persuade independent producers that the BBC should hold on to their programme rights for 13 weeks, the corporation agreed to reduce its share of revenues from such programmes from 50% to 25%. But even though the trust has now capped the download window at 30 days, the BBC is stuck with the Pact deal as it did not negotiate a get-out clause. It's easy to see how this happened but it can hardly count as careful stewardship of licence payers' money. That there is no get-out clause probably means the BBC management simply expected to get its way with the trust. And then there's the question of cost. This is very sensitive. Not because of what the BBC will pay - the iPlayer will cost about \u00a340m a year to run - but because of what people who use the service will be forced to pay. Sure, there is no up-front charge for the downloads, but Ofcom concedes that many people may need to upgrade their broadband services to get sufficient bandwidth to use the BBC service. The BBC estimates (and the trust agrees) that the cost could be as little as 17p per household per month. But it is impossible to know where this figure comes from because the BBC refuses to release the report upon which it is based. It is clearly an average: as any home internet customer knows, the cost of upgrading a broadband service is measured in pounds, not pence. So if users are forced to pay more for their broadband depending on how much they use the BBC's iPlayer download service, what was once a public broadcaster funded by a universal licence fee and free at the point of use becomes, in effect, a pay-as-you-go service. Now that is a sensitive issue. Who will win the FA Cup TV rights? The next few months will see the beginning of the battle to win the rights to screen the FA Cup and England internationals. All the usual suspects can be expected to bid. But this time the landscape has altered. The BBC will be desperate to keep the rights (they currently share them with Sky) but find themselves in straightened times - no more Jacuzzi of cash. ITV have a new executive chairman, no doubt keen to make a splash, and what odds on a joint bid between ITV and its new biggest shareholder? ITV has long felt left out in the cold by the BBC's deals with Sky. But are the tables about to be turned?
