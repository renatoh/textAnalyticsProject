No, it comes from the social-media industry itself. At least, that seems to be the most plausible interpretation of Facebook's latest scheme, unveiled this week. What the world's biggest social-media website (500 million users and rising) plans is simple, yet huge in its implications: members can now have their exact whereabouts disclosed to others. If you are, say, browsing the racks at Topshop or bunking off college for the afternoon, fellow members will know. Facebook executives point out that users opt into this service, but after that it is presumed their location will be shared with others in their network. And unlike \"location data\" sites such as Foursquare, this is not a service original customers have chosen for themselves \u2013 rather, it has been foisted on them. Besides, as users know, mortgage application forms often take less time and trouble to fill out than Facebook's privacy settings. The company will also say that this is information shared among friends \u2013 but \"friends\" on Facebook are rather more loosely defined than in real life, often including the fuzziest of acquaintances, the fuzzy acquaintances of those acquaintances and random networks. And even those with a tiny circle of online friends are susceptible to having their location pasted elsewhere. As privacy campaigners warned yesterday: \"Don't post anything online you wouldn't want to get out publicly to anyone.\" But that is to understate the problem, because what is really going on here is a clash of cultures. On the one hand are the vast majority of internet users who believe that any life worth living must allow a substantial measure of privacy. On the other are individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook (or, as early business cards proudly proclaimed, \"I'm CEO, bitch\"), who think that being online means sharing your intimate details with all and sundry. As Zuckerberg said last year: \"The days of you having a different image for your ... co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly \u2026 Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.\" He calls this radical transparency. You might call this deeply troubling. Nor would you be alone. The boss of Google, Eric Schmidt, this week acknowledged the problems \"when everything is available, knowable and recorded\". The trouble is, Mr Schmidt is one of those who makes a huge profit from tracking users' personal habits online to match advertising to them - so has little incentive to end this situation. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2010. The original stated that members will have their exact whereabouts disclosed and that users can opt out from this service. But that still placed the onus squarely on customers to sign themselves out. Unlike other sites. It also stated that Google sells users' personal information to advertisers. This has all been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
