The show's creator Simon Cowell will again be absent from the judging panel \u2013 he is busy across the Atlantic making the US version for Fox \u2013 but his presence will be heavily felt in the ITV schedule. Cowell's gameshow Red or Black will also return, fronted by Ant and Dec, with a two-part outing wrapped around The X Factor to give it as much of a ratings boost as the talent show can muster. Red or Black, which has changed its format after criticism that it encouraged gambling, disappointed in the ratings last year, as did The X Factor, whose audience for the final fell by 4 million on the previous year, its first reverse since 2007. Elaine Bedell, ITV's director of entertainment and comedy, said The X Factor remained the \"big daddy of all entertainment shows\". ITV1 slumped to its lowest ever audience share in the first week of the Games, and Bedell said: \"We have had a quiet few weeks.\" Last year's X Factor was felt to have been lacklustre without Cowell, with even the show's long-running judge Louis Walsh compared it to the \"Rolling Stones without Mick Jagger\". The new series sees Gary Barlow and N-Dubz star Tulisa Contostavlos return on the judging panel with Nicole Scherzinger, formerly a guest judge on the show, replacing Kelly Rowland. Richard Holloway, managing director of Thames, which makes the show with Cowell's Syco TV, brushed off concerns about last year's ratings. \"We were thrilled with the results for last year's show,\" he said. \"The ratings, they fluctuated from time to time, we were still the number one show on TV. Is there much to complain about really?\" Walsh said: \"It was still the second biggest X Factor last year. The press gave it a hard time, the public loved it.\" Contostavlos added: \"When you drop one million then go back up again, it doesn't mean the show's in crisis. It's changed very much over the year, the viewing figures have fluctuated. It was still the biggest show second to the royal wedding.\" This year's 20-week run will feature a familiar mix of hopefuls and no-hopers, tantrums and tears, and ordinary-looking contestants who turn out to have extraordinary talent. The contents of the first show are strictly a secret until Saturday, but the opening credits include a thinly veiled reference to BBC1's The Voice, which was scheduled against Cowell's other ITV1 talent show, Britain's Got Talent, in the spring. It initially stole BGT's thunder but flopped after the first round of blind auditions, and ITV1 had the last laugh. Walsh tells viewers: \"It's not just about the voice. You need star quality, a good attitude \u2026 you need the X Factor.\" BBC1 will launch its own \"super Saturday\" next month when Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing return. It remains to be seen where they will be scheduled, but it is unlikely to be without controversy. ITV1 has given The X Factor an 8pm slot. Saturday will also see the return of Jonathan Ross's ITV1 chatshow, with guests including the gold medal-winning Olympians Usain Bolt and Jessica Ennis, plus Colin Farrell and Kelly Brook. Guest judges on the new series of The X Factor will include Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown, who early indications suggest will most ably fill Cowell's \"Mr Nasty\" role. In an attempt to widen the pool of talent available, acts with managers are allowed to enter this year's series for the first time. Holloway was keen to point out that all the acts, managerless or not, were treated the same. \"We opened the net wider but everyone who comes along goes through the same process,\" he said. \u2022 This story was amended on 17 August 2012 to reflect the fact that Nicole Scherzinger was a guest judge in last year's show and only became permanent this year"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
