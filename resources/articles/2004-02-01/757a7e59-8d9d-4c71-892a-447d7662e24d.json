Steve Gibson peered through the window at the groundsmen working on the pitch below. The previous night Middlesbrough had defeated their local rivals Newcastle in a Youth Cup tie to move into the last eight of the prestigious competition. Boro are proud of their youth scheme, which after sustained investment is beginning to deliver players such as Stuart Parnaby and Stewart Downing into the first team. Both should be in Middlesbrough's squad of 16 tomorrow in Cardiff and so represent the present as well as the future of the club. Gibson turned away from the window and talked about both. But he began with the past, and the Duchess of Kent. \"She was late,\" Gibson said. It was 1997 and Middlesbrough had reached an FA Cup final for the one and only time in their history. Those were Ravanelli days, Chelsea the opposition. Gibson, who had taken the club into administration in 1986 and was demonised for it, and who then brought it out again and was lionised for it, was anxious. He had poured heart, soul and cash into Boro and the Duchess of Kent was late. Worse, in a corner of the small room underneath Wembley where Gibson and others were waiting, Cliff Richard was practising his scales as he prepared to sing Abide With Me. Ken Bates was there, so too Tony Blair. \"Absolutely surreal,\" as Gibson said. \"And we're all waiting.\" There was another significant character present, Graham Kelly of the FA, football's establishment. \"We lined up until the Duchess arrived and you meet her in the tunnel,\" Gibson explained. \"Cliff was warming up. I thought, 'Do I apologise to her before it's happened, or do I just leave it?' I just left it. I shook hands and she went out on to the pitch.\" It was not Cliff that Gibson was apologising for, it was the reaction that would greet Kelly in front of the Duchess. Four months earlier the Premier League had deducted three points from Middlesbrough for missing a match at Blackburn Rovers. Ultimately this resulted in Boro being relegated on the last day of the season - six days before the Cup final. Gibson knew how the fans felt and when the entourage emerged from the Wembley tunnel 30,000 red arms went up. Later in the day David Mellor, sharp as ever, said Boro's supporters were making Nazi salutes. But actually the fans were raising their fingers - three of them. \"I stood in the tunnel and I'll never forget it,\" Gibson said, \"this booming 'three points, three points', and it echoed around the stadium. It was a very emotional time for the players, for everybody involved with the club, but particularly the fans. Afterwards, I listened to a radio phone-in and David Mellor being highly critical of our supporters for making a Nazi salute and shouting zieg heil . They were shouting 'three points'. I thought it was a tremendously effective demonstration. It was dignified, there was no swearing involved, and I've got to say I thoroughly enjoyed the moment. I enjoyed the discomfort and embarrassment of those in authority who were stood around us. Behind the scenes we were not as dignified as the crowd had been.\" When Gibson is angry his faces darkens like Heathcliff's. When he said: \"That guy in power at the time, Peter Leaver, he had about as much common sense as your average apple,\" you can be sure Leaver heard that and more from Gibson directly. Gibson is wary of giving the impression that he \"has not let go\" when recalling that time but it was a unique period - Middlesbrough also lost the League Cup final that season - and it stirs memories. \"There was a feeling in the club at the time that going into that period of eight or nine games in 23 days - we were fighting for our Premiership survival, an FA Cup final, a League Cup final - that we would win all three or lose all three. There wasn't going to be a halfway house.\" Having lost to Leicester after a replay in the League Cup, there wasn't. So Boro went down three times in one season, only to then reach the League Cup final again in 1998. Again they lost, again Chelsea were the opponents. It means that tomorrow in Cardiff Middlesbrough have unfinished business. They were seen as brash nouveaux riches in the mid-90s when Gibson's directing and Bryan Robson's magnetism attracted the likes of Fabrizio Ravanelli, Emerson and Juninho. The Pauls, Gascoigne and Merson, were to come to Teesside. Robson and Terry Venables were to leave. Now in a sixth consecutive Premiership, Middlesbrough are established, and solvent - \"that clubs as mighty as Leeds and Sunderland can face administration tells you football hasn't handled the money right,\" Gibson said. He remains the unpaid chairman, he has no office at the club and there is no recognised board of directors. Boro are run on a \"no frills\" basis. It feels like the moment to start forgetting 1997, three points and Cliff Richard's warbling. \"It's time to deliver,\" Gibson said. \"That's exactly where we're at. The club needs to win this. We need it as a club, we need it as a group of players, as a management team, and we need it as a town. But perhaps it's unfair to say to those 11 lads: 'You carry the burden of 120 years of history, you carry the burden of my expectation, you carry the burden of the manager's expectation and by the way, we've lost the three previous cup finals, so don't fuck up this one. Now just go out and enjoy yourselves'. \"What's past is past. Nor do the finances come into it, we're here for sporting glory. We just need to get our foothold in that trophy cabinet. Opportunities like this are so infrequent. If we win it and qualify for Europe, the status of the club and everyone in it increases massively. I see the work that goes on behind the scenes, from Steve McClaren and his coaching staff, and although, if you were Bolton chairman, you would be saying the same - because what they've achieved has been fantastic - I just fancy that it's our time. And we've waited a long time for it.\" Gibson, now 46, has done his share of that waiting. It is 19 years since he first became involved at boardroom level, a decade since he took control. He has been fan, director, chairman and even turned out for the reserves in those late 1980s days when Boro sometimes struggled to fulfil fixtures. His enthusiasm has not waned, he even enjoyed, to an extent, Arsenal's 4-0 win at the Riverside in this season's first home game. \"Mesmerising,\" Gibson said of Robert Pires's goal. But even for Gibson a victory tomorrow would feel like some form of Boro renewal. Another failure would be hard to suffer, though there is clearly some planning being done regardless. \"There are perhaps five clubs beyond the rest of us. What we have to do, and what we're capable of doing, what we're resourced to do, is finish the best of the rest. Once you've achieved that you then have to face up to 'how do I bridge that top five'. That's an enormous challenge. I think this squad, with one or two improvements - and Steve is quite clear on what he believes those changes need to be - is capable, given a fair number of injuries, of challenging for that. Maybe not this year, but certainly for next.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
