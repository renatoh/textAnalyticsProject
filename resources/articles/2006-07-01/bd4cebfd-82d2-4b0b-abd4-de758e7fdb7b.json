But it is also suits Israel's changing objectives. At one time, it strongly resisted any attempt to \"internationalise\" its conflicts with its neighbours. Yet as the costs of occupation have risen, Israel has increasingly sought outside help in restraining and containing its enemies beyond unilaterally demarcated borders. Since 9/11, its leaders have been remarkably successful, with US help, in portraying its struggles as part of the global \"war on terror\". Uninspiring precedents for what is now proposed in southern Lebanon can be found on the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed by Israel in 1981. More than 1,000 troops belonging to the UN's disengagement observer force have patrolled the area since 1974. Their mandate was renewed again last month, because \"a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem\" was lacking. Last year's Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was also underwritten in part by EU border monitors deployed along the border with Egypt. Their neutral status has not prevented them being sucked into renewed tension between Israelis and Palestinians. That too may be the fate of any new Lebanon force. Part of the current problem in southern Lebanon stems from the failure of yet another international force, the UN's Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), created in 1978, to prevent continuing hostilities after Israel's 2000 withdrawal. One option now is to expand Unifil, raise the calibre of its troops, and give it a more robust peace enforcement mandate. But that could increase the strain on global UN peacekeeping operations. Few analysts believe the largely Shia Lebanese army has the capability or the willpower for the job. So other options include a Nato-led force, although the US will not send troops and the alliance has its hands full in Afghanistan; or an EU force under UN auspices, which Israeli officials say is their preference. Britain and Germany have already said they will not contribute soldiers. And Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, hinted at difficulties yesterday: \"It's a real possibility. It is not an easy force to deploy but we have been working to try to construct a concept.\" France, Italy and Greece have indicated they will contribute. So, too, has Turkey. But Romano Prodi, Italy's prime minister, says 10,000 troops are needed - a tall order for Brussels given its Balkan commitments. British officials say the likely outcome is a hybrid \"coalition of the willing\" under a UN mandate. In any case, Israel clearly sees an opportunity to have crack international troops pick up the security burden on both the Lebanese and Syrian sides of its borders - and possibly one day in the rump Palestinian territories. In this way, the international community is effectively co-opted. \"It doesn't matter who runs the mission,\" said Shimon Peres, Israel's deputy prime minister. \"It's just important that the mission is accomplished ... as long as the border is cleared of Hizbullah missile-launching pads.\" Israel's ability to persuade less experienced outside interlocutors to adopt its aims and objectives was evident in remarks by foreign office minister Kim Howells, who visited Amman yesterday. \"Hizbullah has to either be persuaded or forced to give up its arms and start behaving like a democratic organisation within a democratic Lebanon,\" he said. But just who or what can disarm or even deter Hizbullah in future remains unclear. Even the most sympathetic European countries do not want to do Israel's fighting for it. Neither, for all its rhetoric, does the US. More sophisticated, longer-range missiles mean Hizbullah could fire over the heads of any intervention force. The group has its tail up right now. It warned yesterday, from Iran of all places, that the fight would continue until \"no place is safe\" for Israelis. Its statements suggest it would not shy away from an Iraq-style insurgency against \"western occupiers\". Without a negotiated settlement of the Palestine-Israel conflict - the real \"root cause\" of the Lebanon war - any international force may be on a hiding to nothing. For all these reasons, expect protracted negotiations over composition and rules of engagement and long delays before full deployment. A fudge cannot be ruled out, once the political pressure eases."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
