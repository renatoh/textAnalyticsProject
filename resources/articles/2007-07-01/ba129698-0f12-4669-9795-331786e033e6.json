Not only would the invasion contribute to international order, Tony Blair said, but it would cut off at its roots the threat of terrorism in the UK. Many disputed the link between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein and pointed out that war and occupation might assist extremist organisations recruiting British Muslims, giving terrorism a spurious (but, to the wrong-headed, compelling) moral justification. When, following the invasion, it was suggested that Britain had been made a more obvious target for Islamist terrorism, Tony Blair accused those who made this case of appeasement. He pointed out (rightly) that non-participants in the war were also targets, and that 9/11 was one of several attacks al-Qaida staged before Iraq. Those who warned that the war would antagonise Muslims were accused of indulging - and even stoking up - disaffection. The prophecy that occupying Iraq meant attacking al-Qaida has proved grimly self-fulfilling. Osama bin Laden's network has become associated with resistance to British and American involvement in Iraq - either directly, or by using the fate of Iraqis as supposed proof of the west's malign intentions towards Muslims. Can it be denied that the invasion encouraged a growth in al-Qaida's threat and influence? It is time for a new prime minister to revisit these arguments. The daily carnage in Iraq is perhaps hard to acknowledge for members of the cabinet involved in the chain of events that led finally to this hellish instability. Each and every day ordinary Iraqis are victims of the sort of mayhem planned for London and Glasgow last week. Most civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are at the hands of non-western forces, yet it is still the west that gets the blame - and, indeed, it has some responsibility for the context in which they happen. That techniques from Iraq - petrol and gas canisters placed in cars - seem to have been exported to the UK is more than symbolic. It is not proof of a direct link with al-Qaida, nor should it absolve the would-be bombers from condemnation. Yet it is wrong to claim there is no link to Iraq. Indeed, this past weekend there appeared to be some striking, if grotesque, parallels. Today, a refusal to acknowledge that the much more lethal carnage in Iraq is in part a consequence of western actions is damaging the national interest. It would be wrong to think that Britain either could or should sue for peace. At its core, Islamist fundamentalism is irreconcilable with western values. It must be confronted, as it was before Iraq. But in the ease with which extremists may recruit disaffected European Muslims lies softer, human territory. It is here that the government might increase domestic security by disproving the arguments the extremists use and giving the lie to the false picture they paint of Britain. Gordon Brown's new government has to find a form of words that acknowledges Britain's role in creating - unintentionally - the conditions for instability, civil war and mayhem. It has to find not just the will to disengage over time (such a will already exists) but the language to convince listeners that this is now the government's settled purpose. Such an approach would not extirpate the terrorist cause in Britain, but it would be a start in altering the conditions in which terrorists recruit. It would also be morally and historically right. After Suez, Britain's friends in the world held faith with a confidence that decent parts of our public life never wavered in their opposition to the ill-fated adventure, and represented another side of the British character. As a new prime minister seeks to rebuild Britain's international reputation, an early signal that this tendency is winning the argument, and shall prevail, would be both right and in our national interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
