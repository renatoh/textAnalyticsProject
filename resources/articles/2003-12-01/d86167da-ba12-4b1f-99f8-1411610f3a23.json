Merges the classic Parisian feel (for example tiny lifts going up through spiral staircases) with the modern to great effect. It all feels very professional but friendly, perfectly up-to-date but with plenty of character. The rooms: Cosy and chic; warm colours, deep reds and greens; state of the art flat screen TV and DVD with heavy wooden furniture: wardrobes, chest of drawers. Double windows opening onto tiny balconies; from the upper floors you can see across the skyline to the Eiffel tower. The bed test: A traditional number with a heavy wooden bedstead, but perfectly comfortable. The bathroom: Pretty much the standard contemporary black and white chic, but well designed with lots of mirrors, metal basins and bespoke accessories. The restaurant: It is actually called, simply, \"Le restaurant\" here, but the food is still top-notch, at prices to match. Continental or a la carte breakfast served at table. What else is there? The small bar has apparently become a bit of a chic meeting place on the Left Bank. Guardian newspapers are on offer by reception - surely the international hallmark of a classy hotel. The worst thing: A little bit of noise from the street if you're staying on the lower floors. And it has the least legible, most pretentiously designed hotel website I've seen. What can you do in the vicinity? You're just a step from boulevard St Germain, with chic shops aplenty. Caf\u00e9 Flore and Les Deux Magots are nearby, and cheaper Left Bank restaurants not far away. In the other direction, you can stroll down the Seine. And it's very close indeed to one major Paris attraction, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, which gives you time to get up gently and still beat the queues. How much? From \u20ac290 a night; packages for longer stays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
