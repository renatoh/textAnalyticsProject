Perez had said in an interview with the magazine France Football that Real would not miss Makelele, who joined the Premiership club in a \u00a316.6m deal last week. \"He wasn't a header of the ball and he rarely passed the ball more than three metres,\" Perez said. \"Younger players will arrive who will cause Makelele to be forgotten.\" Makelele, Chelsea's 13th signing since Roman Abramovich became the club's president, said he preferred not to respond to Perez's comments. \"I don't care what Florentino says. If he wants to say I'm a bad player, let him do so. I don't think his comments merit a reply. I really don't feel like discussing them,\" Makelele was reported as saying in the Spanish newspaper Marca in the lead up to France's Euro 2004 qualifying game in Slovenia last night. Perez said the arrival from Manchester United of David Beckham \"had compensated totally\" for the French international's departure and \"the team is now stronger than it was a year ago\". Perez also said in the interview that he believed Makelele's attitude in his final days at Madrid stemmed from \"bad advice\". He added: \"I am surprised at the difference between the exemplary behaviour he showed over the last three years, on and off the field, and that which he has shown recently. I believe it is due to bad advice. He wanted half of what [Zinedine] Zidane is earning and that was not possible.\" The French international's departure turned increasingly acrimonious when he demanded 15% of the transfer fee on the day the move was to be finalised. Makelele then chose to waive the demand. \"He had no right to this bonus,\" Perez added. The Real Madrid coach Carlos Queiroz was also critical of the manner of Maekele's departure in the Portuguese sports newspaper A Bola yesterday, saying it \"violates the principles of contractual and professional relations\". Before his departure, Makelele, who had three years remaining on his contract, staged a week-long strike in an effort to force Real's hand. \"The way that it happened is not good for football. If a player who wants to be transferred stops training this sport is placed at risk,\" Queiroz said. Makelele helped Real to win the Champions League in 2002 and Spanish titles in 2001 and 2003. He joined the Spanish club in 2000 from Celta Vigo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
