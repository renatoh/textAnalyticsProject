One of these positions was reserved for a fashion disability champion who would, the DWP claimed, \u201copen industry doors\u201d. Five new champions were appointed on schedule; in the fields of brand and design; countryside and heritage; products and spaces; technology; and web accessibility. The champion for the fashion industry was absent. The DWP explained that during a seven-week recruitment process the vacancy was advertised in the fashion trade press, directly to fashion brands and on social media. No applications were received, and the department is now reviewing its recruitment procedure. Yet for many of those with disabilities, this initial outcome will be disappointing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the doors have ever been open for people with disabilities,\u201d says the TV presenter and activist Sophie Morgan, who presented Channel 4\u2019s coverage of the 2016 Paralympic Games. Despite some fashion retailers, including River Island and Primark, making what Morgan says are \u201cgreat strides\u201d, the overall experience both online and in-store \u201cremains a negative one\u201d for disabled clothes shoppers. Morgan spearheaded the Mannequal campaign, which urged fashion retailers to include mannequins in wheelchairs as part of window displays, to act as a much-needed \u201csign to disabled consumers that this particular retailer has considered, and will attempt to meet, their needs\u201d. But, she says, more should be done. Due to her activist endeavours and role in the television coverage of the Paralympics, Morgan may well have been a prime candidate to take on the job of fashion disability champion. Despite this, she had never heard about the initiative. The Team GB Paralympian Chloe Ball-Hopkins, who collaborated with Asos in 2018 to develop festival wear designed to accommodate the needs of wheelchair users, agrees that fashion is letting disabled shoppers down. She sees \u201ca few companies making good ground\u201d but still finds that when she goes clothes shopping she will often \u201cstruggle to reach half the clothes on the racks due to the height\u201d. Ball-Hopkins hadn\u2019t heard of the position being advertised either, and was similarly surprised it hadn\u2019t attracted interest. But Justin Tomlinson, the minister for disabled people, doesn\u2019t think the position remains unfilled due to a lack of effort on the DWP\u2019s part, although he does feel that the British fashion industry is \u201cmissing a trick by not doing enough to cater to disabled consumers\u201d. Although fashion for disabled people has been overlooked thus far, a champion for retail was appointed in 2018. This, alongside campaigns such as Mannequal, may have led to retailers improving physical accessibility to shops \u2013 but Morgan has found, when shopping for clothes, that a warm welcome rarely awaits people with disabilities. \u201cWe may just be lucky enough to gain physical access to the retail space,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we feel welcome and able to fully engage.\u201d She likens the experience of clothes shopping to the scene in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts\u2019 newly affluent character returns to a boutique in which she was once humiliated to flaunt the commission the sales assistants will never receive. \u201cShe comes back with the immortal line: \u2018Big mistake \u2026 HUGE,\u2019\u201d Morgan recounts. \u201cI feel like saying that so often! We have money, we want to spend it the same as anyone else, why stop us?\u201d This is an area where activists and the DWP agree. Both parties say businesses aren\u2019t doing enough to earn the \u201cpurple pound\u201d, the \u00a3249bn disabled consumers spend each year. \u201cIf brands want to capitalise on the disabled consumer market, they must first improve representation of disabled people in fashion,\u201d says Tomlinson. \u201cWhether that\u2019s in advertising campaigns or on the catwalk.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
