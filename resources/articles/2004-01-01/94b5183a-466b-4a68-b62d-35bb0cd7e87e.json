The German goalkeeper, who faces an investigation after throwing the ball at Phillips following the final whistle, claimed yesterday that the Southampton striker got away with what he considers to be foul play. \"He pushed me in the back and stamped on my foot,\" Lehmann said. \"Shouldn't you also be punished for that?\" The referee Steve Dunn did not caution Lehmann since the ball-throwing occurred after the final whistle but although the goalkeeper apologised to the officials soon after, the official recorded the incident in his report. The FA may also consider previous behaviour if the Arsenal man is charged. Lehmann was warned about his future conduct after his involvement in the unruly scenes during Arsenal's Premiership visit to Old Trafford this season. PSV Eindhoven, meanwhile, are hoping to repel Manchester United's approach for the Netherlands' young player of the year Arjen Robben by making good the shortfall in their income with the sale of two others. The Dutch club are struggling financially following their failure to reach the knockout phase of the Champions League and have announced that they intend to raise funds in the transfer market. That prompted United to inquire about the 19-year-old left-sided midfielder and Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to meet with the Dutch international in the coming days. However PSV's chairman Harry van Raaij prefers to cash in on two of Mateja Kezman, Kevin Hofland and Marc van Bommel, while retaining Robben. Kezman has drawn admiring glances from the Premiership while Hofland has declared his intention to leave and Van Raaij is urging the captain Van Bommel to seek a club in one of Europe's bigger leagues. \u00b7 West Ham have sent Youssef Sofiane on loan to Lille for the remainder of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
