An emergency meeting of the World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday unanimously voted to exclude Russia and also prevent it from hosting or bidding to host any global tournaments. The ban was imposed by Wada\u2019s executive committee after Russia was found to have tampered with laboratory data handed over to Wada as a condition for ending a previous three-year ban for state-sponsored doping. While the decision was hailed by Wada as the \u201cstrongest possible\u201d response, it was criticised by some campaigners for failing to go far enough. The Russian national anthem and flag will be absent from both Tokyo and Qatar, but under the terms of the sanction Russian athletes can still compete at international events under a \u2018neutral banner\u2019 if they are able to prove themselves to be clean. This includes the possibility that a team which does not actually represent a nation competes at the football World Cup for the first time. Russia now has 21 days to appeal the verdict. Announcing the sanction, the chief executive of Wada, Sir Craig Reedie, said: \u201cFor too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and rejoin the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial. As a result, the Wada ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.\u201d Criticisms of the decision came from inside Wada itself, with the organisation\u2019s vice-president and a vocal critic of Russian doping, Linda Helleland, saying it fell short of the ultimate sanction of a blanket ban for Russia and its athletes. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the decision we made today. But this is as far as we could go,\u201d Helleland said. \u201cThis is the biggest sports scandal the world has ever seen. I would expect now a full admission from the Russians and for them to apologise [for] all the pain athletes and sports fans have experienced.\u201d Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, who had previously said anything but a ban on participation for any Russian athletes would be inadequate, said Wada\u2019s decision proved the system was flawed. \u201cTo allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport and the rule of law,\u201d Tygart said. \u201cAnd, in turn, the reaction by all those who value sport should be nothing short of a revolt against this broken system to force reform.\u201d Russia, for its part, also denounced the verdict. \u201cThe decisions from Wada repeat themselves and often they concern athletes who had already been penalised, let alone other issues\u201d, said the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. \u201cIt certainly brings us back to the theme of this anti-Russian hysteria which is turning into a chronic disease. I think that organisations responsible for this \u2013 and I mean Russian organisations \u2013 for which this is their area of expertise, they need to think of a way to carefully insert an appeal a result of this kind of decision.\u201d An appeal, which will be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and whose verdict will be final, was at the forefront of thinking for UK Anti-Doping. \u201cThis was the only possible outcome that the Wada ExCo could take to reassure athletes and the public and continue the task of seeking justice for those cheated by Russian athletes\u201d, said UKad\u2019s chief executive Nicole Sapstead. \u201cWe know however that this is not necessarily the end of the matter. If Rusada choose to appeal this decision to Cas, this must be carried out with minimal delay, especially in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.\u201d Evidence of widespread Russian doping was first revealed by Wada four years ago with a report claiming that at least 643 positive tests had been hidden by authorities. That resulted in the suspension of the Russian Athletics Federation (Rusaf) and 111 individual athletes being banned from the 2016 games in Rio. Last year Wada made the controversial decision to reinstate the Russian anti-doping agency on the condition that it complied with requests to share its laboratory results. Those results were subsequently found to have been tampered with, and led to renewed calls for punishment. \u201cFlagrant manipulation\u201d of the Moscow lab data was \u201can insult to the sporting movement worldwide\u201d, the International Olympic Committee said last month. The specific terms of Wada\u2019s new sanction include a provision against Russia hosting or applying to host international sporting events. St Petersburg\u2019s role as host city in next summer\u2019s European football championships is not included in the ban as Uefa is not considered a \u2018major event organisation\u2019. A planned bid to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup, however, would likely be scrapped. As for the football World Cup, Fifa said it was in discussions with Wada \u201cto clarify the extent of the decision\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
