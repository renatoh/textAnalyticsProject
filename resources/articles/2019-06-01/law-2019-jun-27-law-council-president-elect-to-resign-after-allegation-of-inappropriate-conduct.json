Guardian Australia understands the investigation was unable to determine the allegation and made no adverse finding against either Kerloy, a partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, and a past president of the Law Society of Western Australia, or the complainant, a fellow director at the council. Kerloy has consistently denied the allegation which was made against him on 23 March. Arthur Moses, the president of the Law Council of Australia, said on Thursday subsequent to the independent investigation, the parties participated in a mediation before the former federal court justice and Australian Human Rights Commission president Catherine Branson. Moses said Kerloy voluntarily stood aside during the inquiry to avoid any suggestion that he was in a position to influence any decision. He then resumed his duties on 25 May 2019, following a board meeting of the council that considered the report of the independent investigator and the outcome of the mediation. Despite returning to duty as president-elect, Moses said Kerloy had subsequently \u201creluctantly concluded that the matter may continue to be an unnecessary distraction from the important work of the Law Council\u201d. He indicated he would resign from the council on Thursday, Moses said, \u201cin the best interests of the Law Council\u201d. \u201cI have accepted Mr de Kerloy\u2019s resignation and thank Konrad for his tireless work and contribution to the national profession,\u201d Moses said in a statement issued on Thursday. \u201cHe has made a significant contribution to the Law Council as a director since 2014 and since his election to office in 2017 as treasurer and, more recently, as president-elect\u201d. Moses said Kerloy, by resigning, had \u201cdemonstrated his commitment\u201d to the work of the council and he wished him well. Guardian Australia revealed the investigation was under way in late March. At the time, Moses said the council \u201cdoes not tolerate sexual harassment or discrimination in any form. It is acting quickly and decisively to ensure the matter is appropriately dealt with\u201d. Herbert Smith Freehills\u2019 executive partner Andrew Pike said: \u201cKonrad is a highly respected member of our firm. He has made a significant contribution over many years both to the firm and to the legal profession through the Law Society of Western Australia and the Law Council of Australia. \u201cWe fully support Konrad\u2019s decision and are pleased he can now devote his full attention to his role with us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
