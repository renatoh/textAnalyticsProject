I'm inclined towards the latter, of course, and have spent the rest of the week in the stocks, pelting myself with any rotten produce that was (very) close to hand. That said, there was \"fun\" to be had with mondegreens and some of them make it to the top of this week's column. You can read and comment on the column as usual, but the A-list is as follows: Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears \u2013 The Bonnie Earl o'Moray; Cocteau Twins \u2013 Aikea Guinea; Brian Eno \u2013 Here Come the Warm Jets; David Bowie \u2013 Subterraneans; Adriano Celentano \u2013 Prisencolinensinainciusol; Richard Berry and the Pharoahs \u2013 Louie Louie; The Fendermen \u2013 Mule Skinner Blues; Crystal Castles \u2013 Courtship Dating; Busta Rhymes and Twista \u2013 Break Ya Neck; Caleb \u2013 Baby Your Phrasing Is Bad When one list ends, another must begin. Here be your B: Yellowman \u2013 Zungguzungguguzungguzeng Actually, there is nothing indecipherable about this track, but it's a top guitar line and the idea of hundreds of yellow children makes me smile Clap Your Hands Say Yeah \u2013 Mama, Won't You Keep Them Castles in the Air Burning Expected more stoned/zonked nominations last week. This definitely fits into that category, but it drags you along with it into the clouds. Cab Calloway \u2013 St Louis Blues I like me some wah-wah trumpet and a singer who can hold a note longer than I can listen to it. I'm not sure scat is indecipherable (is there anything to decipher?) but it's fun. Melanie \u2013 Lay Down Candles in the Rain Didn't know this song, but it's such a big number I think I probably should have. The power makes up for a lack of topicality. Happy Mondays \u2013 Do It Better Mr Manshambles himself, Shaun William Ryder, garbles a long list of some things or other, but I was too busy doing a Bez to notice. Death Cab for Cutie \u2013 This Charming Man A nice enough cover, I would almost say it was too faithful to the original if it weren't for the fact they got the lyrics wrong. REM \u2013 Gardening at Night Speak up son! Genuinely cannot make out a single word in the verses. Not a great song, in my opinion, but bang on topic. Abe Vigoda \u2013 Bearface Picking up the mumbling baton from REM, and adding their own atonality, Abe Vigoda prove that if you really want to have not a single clue what's going on, then college rock's the music for you. Olsen Olsen \u2013 Sigur Ros Raised the question of whether invented languages make a lyric indecipherable or not. As one RRer pointed out though (can't find who!) the words may not have meaning but they do convey a mood. Largely that mood is ecstatic, as is the case here. Sa Ding Ding \u2013 Oldster by Xilin River I may be wrong, given that I can't understand the lyrics (even the apparently invented element at the end), but I found this song to be quite chilling. Like a Massive Attack track with guest vocals from Chuckie the killer doll. On to this week's topic. We've had drinking songs, we've had nightclub songs (check the Marconium for the A-lists), but this week we're going right to the heart of the matter. I want songs set in pubs (or bars, if they're in the rest of the world), songs that namecheck individual establishments, but not songs that simply mention a bar or pub in passing. Here's your toolkit: The toolbox: Archive, the Marconium, the Spill, the Collabo (apologies for forgetting to add the collabo last week, I got distracted and thanks, Steenbeck, for making one). The rulebook: DO NOT post more than a third of the lyrics to any one song. DO Post your nominations before midday on Monday if you wish them to be considered. DO Post justifications of your choices wherever possible. DO Be nice to each other! See you on the blog"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
