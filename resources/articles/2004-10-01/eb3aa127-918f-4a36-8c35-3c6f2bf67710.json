None of them ever did a Tony Blair and announced they would be quitting after another full term in power. He is like an overstaying guest who looks at his watch around 10pm and says, \"gosh, is that the time al ready? Why don't I book a cab for 12.30?\" Not that anyone believes he will last the full four years. He had to claim he'd be a long time leaving if only to keep that frisson of terror all leaders need to evoke. If you can't scare the groundlings, if you can't make them wake up sweating in the middle of the night because you forgot their first name, then you might as well give up and retire straight away to Paddington (as the estate agents don't call it). What he will have created, though, is a twisting maelstrom of ambition. People will say he has fired the starting gun, but it is not quite like that. Westminster will be more like the scene around the bookies between races. The place will be full of knowing men with bits of paper, backs of beer mats, stubby pencils, all mulling over scraps of information, constantly computing the odds. Nothing will be too small to count. When you sprinkle the first tiny flakes of food on top of an aquarium, all the fish swirl up to grab their share. Word zips round the Palace of Westminster as fast as email round the internet. W offended one Labour region by refusing to talk to them. He was seen buying a drink for X, even though they haven't spoken for years. The Sun is about to reveal that Y has a mistress. \"Z was so embarrassing on Question Time, I had to turn off. He looked like a cross between Rod Hull and Emu.\" Even the likes of me will have a minuscule role: \"Did you see what the sketchwriters said about him? Imagine if he did that on the Today programme!\" Groups will coalesce around the main candidates and every MP will have to decide whether to join one. Be in with the winner, and you could make it to the cabinet. But if you've cleaved to a loser, it can harm you badly. Or you might want to keep your counsel, and pledge your vote only when you have worked out the likely winner. But that's risky, because the top jobs will already be spoken for, and in any case what new leader is famous for keeping his word - a word whispered in your ear by a junior monkey, third assistant to the organ grinder? Surprising names will emerge. When Jim Callaghan resigned, I jokily asked one very junior member of the cabinet, someone roughly as likely to become Labour leader as John Redwood is today, if he was going to throw his hat into the ring. I expected a jovial laugh in return, but I didn't get it. \"A number of people have approached me..\" he said, and I realised that some people live trapped in a forest of self-delusion. For Labour MPs, the problems are more complicated than they are for the Tories, who have to persuade an electorate of only 163 to put them on a short list of two, then start touring the shires. Putative Labour leaders need to persuade their colleagues, the party in the country, and the trade unions as well. Watch who hits the rubber chicken circuit (though these days it's as likely to be a curry supper). Who will turn up at union conferences, hinting at an end to oppressive Tory legislation? Or who can be seen with the power-broking general secretaries in a corner of the Cinnamon Club? What will happen when there is a crisis, such as BSE, foot and mouth, or Hatfield? Or, worse, if we have our own 9/ll? An effective and resourceful response could get someone elected; feeble dithering could end their chances forever. Events, parliamentary performances, TV appearances, words muttered in corridors to receptive ears - they will all change the odds, like the lottery balls bashing against each other on Saturday night. Politicians love to tell you that it's values, it's their desire to create a better life for our people, that motivate them. To a real extent that is true. But what they really love is the competition, the political mud-wrestling, the sheer joy of being a combatant and a spectator at the same time. And these days they will be more effective in their campaigning. Friends of Roy Jenkins used to tell him that if he ever hoped to be Labour leader, he would need to woo the more obscure, less intellectually gifted MPs. After all, they each had as many votes as Tony Crosland or Shirley Williams. He was urged to buy a few of them a drink. Which he did, for one bemused Welsh mining MP. This chap, who had never even met Jenkins, was asked what he wanted, served a pint of Fed, then told by the great man: \"I wish I could join you, but unfortunately I have an urgent meeting ... \""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
