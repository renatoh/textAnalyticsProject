I would really rather he didn't. It makes them far too good for my liking. Too cohesive, too fluent and it's just too depressing. Things were looking so good - Steve McClaren in charge, no Beckham, no direction and no hope. I know what you are thinking. Just as millions of years of evolution have had a minimal effect on our primitive instincts, give a laddie civilisation, education, emigration and integration and he's still a tartan troglodyte. At least, in my defence, I've got a modicum of self-knowledge. I know you understand. It's a football thing. Against Brazil and Estonia, Beckham the gal\u00e1ctico was the most recent player to represent England from outside the domestic game and in their next international the Galaxico will, however much Real rue it, be the first cap from an American club. But, who was the first player to get selected for England while with a non-English club? It was somewhat controversial. Your final answer? If you think LA Galaxy and England is a ludicrous combination, a flawed and farcical football juxtaposition, well try this one for size: Hibs and England. Hibs and England? My God. It's the red dwarf in Don't Look Now. It's Regan's 360-degree head turn in The Exorcist. It's a Hearts fan's darkest nightmare. I'll try and compose myself. Beckham's \"nightmare\" 11-hour flight will be a stroll in the Home Depot Centre compared to our mystery man's first journey south. It's not as if David will be turning right when he gets on the plane or enduring anything more traumatic than a plate of sushi and a Johnny Depp movie. The Hibs and England man damn nearly turned round and headed homeward, to think again, the minute he reached London. The story of Joe Baker is one of football's great tales. Baker, as Scottish as shortbread, was by a quirk of fate born in Liverpool in 1940, the son of a merchant seaman. In those days you had to represent the country where you were born so for Joe, Scotland was a no. His prolific scoring rate with the Edinburgh side had brought the big striker to Walter Winterbottom's attention and in 1959 he got the call for a Home International against Northern Ireland. Baker told the story brilliantly in a Radio Scotland documentary made not long before he died, speaking, of course, in his broad West of Scotland accent. \"At Heathrow I jumped in a taxi and this cockney driver says, 'Where are you going?', so I told him the Hendon Hotel. The driver said, 'That's where the England team stay' and I said, 'Aye, I'm playing for them Wednesday night'. And the driver never said another thing for the next quarter of an hour.\" After the long silence, Baker noticed a police car roaring up behind them, and the next thing he knew the taxi had pulled over and two cops \"with braided hats\" came up to the window. The driver had been on his radio and called the police. He'd assumed he had a dangerous lunatic in the back of his cab. \"So you are playing for England, are you?\" said one of the coppers sarcastically. Baker recalled: \"I said 'Aye' and he didnae understand me. So I said 'Yes' instead. Luckily Desmond Hackett had written in the Daily Express that day 'Why bring a Scotsman to play for England?' and I had the paper. I said 'Look, that's me' and the policeman turned to his mate and said, 'God, Fred. Are we that bad?'\" Baker scored a cracker on his debut and went on to win a further seven caps, almost making the 1966 squad. His second international, however, against Scotland at the old Hampden in front of 130,000 people, was a miserable experience. He found the constant booing and taunts of \"Sassenach bastard\" and \"Baker, you traitor\" deeply upsetting. He would so loved to have played for Scotland and would have done many times but for his less than fortuitous birthplace. Hearing him speak about playing in the white shirt with Bobby Charlton, Johnny Haynes and others is a joy. \"I didn't feel relaxed but, you know, they were a nice bunch of lads.\" He went on to join Torino, Arsenal, Nottingham Forest, Sunderland, Hibs again and finally Raith Rovers. Grab the film rights for the Reluctant Englishman. It is a fantastic story. Meanwhile, the LA Galaxy general manager, Alexi Lalas, the man who as a player once resembled a beatnik backpacker but now resembles an ex-beatnik backpacker turned Apple executive, says he is so proud he will even drive Beckham to the airport. Good luck at Heathrow, Dave. \"LA Galaxy and England? We've got a right loony on board.\" Boycott, God's gift and the ability to play by smell I was listening to Geoffrey Boycott on the radio the other day talking about the fact that he'd bumped into Andrew Strauss. Boycs told him straight that he'd spotted a few technical problems in the young man's technique but they could be easily sorted. Whether Strauss asked him to elaborate or Geoffrey even offered is unclear but the loveable curmudgeon huffed that it wasn't his job anyway. He then came out with a seemingly casual remark that grabbed me by the googlies. \"I think I understand batting. Some great players don't. They are just naturally supremely gifted.\" Ain't that the truth. In every sport there are some who have such a God-given, God-like (God, I'm jealous) innate instinct for what they do that if you asked them to explain it, analyse it or deconstruct it they wouldn't have a clue. Some force of nature is at work elevating the kicking, hitting or throwing of a ball into a thing majestic, sublime and way beyond our ken. A veteran broadcaster once told me that Denis Law, for example - intelligent, witty and otherwise hugely perceptive - was a disappointing match analyst. \"As a player he couldn't tell you why he went on a sudden dart to a certain part of the six-yard box. He just did it.\" He didn't read the game, he smelt it. To ask him to sit back and explain it was hopeless. Now, there is something beautiful about that. 'I've been misquoted' is footballers' favourite excuse I was talking to Jonathan Agnew about Fredalopedalogate the other day and the dear old thing was candid about his own occasional lack of candour. \"It's the easiest excuse to make, I've used it - 'I've been misquoted'. You often used to get away with it, these days increasingly less so.\" \"I never said that\" or the more erudite \"I have been misquoted\" is the footballer's favourite get-out, best exemplified when Glenn Hoddle added grammatical insult to religious injury: \"I never said them things.\" Not only had he said them things but he'd said them before - in this life. Another dubious excuse is from foreign players who spit out poison to their press compatriots and then claim, with Jacques Chirac-style shrug of the shoulders, to have been \"mistranslated\". Massimo Maccarone tried that one, unsuccessfully, after he'd poured a bucket-load over poor Steve McClaren. They're all contemptible, lying two-faced money-grabbing cowards. But don't take that out of context. Terry explains the offside rules for budget wedding The \u00a3108,000-a-week John Terry gets married tomorrow. The invitation to the greatest day of his and Toni Poole's life disseminates the glad tidings by rather tersely and strictly stipulating \"No cameras, OK?\" The well-known celebrity periodical has snapped up the rights and is no doubt already bidding for the sequel. According to the News of the World the invitation, \"bound in a cream coloured cover with a glossy snakeskin motif\" contains \"some simple rules we've agreed on\". Do they make themselves clear? We don't want any trouble, now do we? That would be a shame; get my drift sunshine? Why doesn't he go the whole horrendous hog and perform a lucrative chocolate promotion like Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey so memorably did? That went down very well. How about Terry's All Gold? Stone me, what a vulgar farrago. I'm definitely not going."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
