One quarter of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer in the most widespread outbreak ever witnessed, according to analysis of aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs released on Tuesday. Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: \u201cMy greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there\u2019s no action. \u201cPeople need to see these [bleaching] events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.\u201d Prof Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights. Hughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef \u2013 northern, central and southern \u2013 the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998. Some 25% of the reefs were severely bleached \u2013 meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached. Hughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to \u201chigh levels of mortality\u201d of corals. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events \u2013 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 \u2013 all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating. Hughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species. The 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said. Corals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals. Hughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef \u2013 from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that \u201clight up like a Christmas tree\u201d when viewed from the air. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.\u201d In February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900. Some scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually. Wachenfeld said the reef\u2019s sheer size \u2013 it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs \u2013 made it resilient, \u201cbut climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before\u201d. He told Guardian Australia: \u201cThree mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate. \u201cNo one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.\u201d The globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Wachenfeld said: \u201cWe\u2019re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.\u201d Measures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals. \u201cNone of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,\u201d Wachenfeld said. \u201cDealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.\u201d Under the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C. \u201cThat\u2019s the window we have to aim for,\u201d Wachenfeld said. \u201cAs we approach and go beyond 2C, I don\u2019t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef. \u201cThe world is heading for 3C of warming \u2013 we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances. \u201cThe reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.\u201d In a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience. \u201cThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures. \u201cThankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.\u201d Queensland\u2019s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats \u201care testing the reef\u2019s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.\u201d She said the Palaszczuk government had \u201ccommitted to a zero net emissions target by 2050\u201d and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022. \u201cThe missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
