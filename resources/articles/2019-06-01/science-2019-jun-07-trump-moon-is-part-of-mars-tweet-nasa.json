In a tweet, apparently commenting on his own administration\u2019s space policy, the president said: \u201cFor all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago.\u201d He added: \u201cThey should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!\u201d Trump\u2019s declaration shocked many space enthusiasts, because the moon has not traditionally been regarded as part of Mars. The leading theory is that a collision between Earth and a planet-sized entity, many years ago, resulted in debris that eventually became the moon. On average Mars is 140m miles from the moon. Nasa did not immediately respond to a question from the Guardian asking if the moon is part of Mars. Irrespective of whether the moon is part of Mars (it isn\u2019t), Trump\u2019s announcement was doubly surprising given his previous enthusiasm for a moon trip. His criticism of Nasa for \u201ctalking about going to the moon\u201d came just three weeks after Trump championed the idea of a lunar visit. On 13 May Trump said in a tweet: \u201cWe are going back to the moon,\u201d while in March Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, who was appointed by Trump, announced plans to send US astronauts to the moon by 2024. In October Mike Pence, the vice-president, said: \u201cOur determination is to see Americans back on the moon in the very near future.\u201d There is a possibility Trump\u2019s tweet was a comment on Nasa\u2019s broader plan to eventually travel to Mars from the moon, but either way it soon emerged that Trump\u2019s moon reversal may have been provoked by the Fox Business TV channel. One hour before the president offered his take on the moon\u2019s origin and his criticism of Nasa, Fox guest Neil Cavuto had expressed scepticism over a moon trip. Cavuto reportedly told the TV cable network that Nasa is \u201crefocusing on the moon, the next sort of quest, if you will, but didn\u2019t we do this moon thing quite a few decades ago?\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a Guardian question about whether Trump\u2019s statement should be considered official guidance. In ancient times the moon was worshipped as a god, while more recently some children\u2019s stories have speculated that it is made of cheese."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
