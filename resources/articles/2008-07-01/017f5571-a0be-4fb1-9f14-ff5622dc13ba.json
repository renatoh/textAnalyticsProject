He was blonde, apparently capable of developing relationships and more than happy to take his clothes off for the camera. He was practically a woman, people said, and I don't think they meant that in the nice way. Now the trailer for Quantum of Solace is out, we can report that it wasn't just a one off. Bond still has: Emotions! A female boss refusing to take any nonsense! And more naked flesh on show than any of the women in the film! What has Craig done to Bond? I don't know, but, gosh, I think I like it. Unfair treatment? Claws are out for Sienna Miller this week, after she was spotted in LA with married father-of-four, scion of a loaded family and marginally successful actor Balthazar Getty. Mainly they've been spotted looking bored, but the world's press is struggling for ever more inventive ways of insinuating - without any evidence - that they are Doing It. As ever, it's a question of different values for different sexes, yet he's the only one of them to have made binding vows to another person and brought four children into the world. And he's not the one attracting the majority of the vicious commentary. Glastonbury casualty Everyone knows Amy Winehouse's Glastonbury appearance was the most depressing thing in Somerset this weekend, but which was worse? The random acts of violence towards the crowd, the impression that she's not winning her battle with drugs, or her persistent devotion to her freeloading jailbird enabler husband, Blake? Standing by your man is all very well, but not when all you've got is a little boy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
