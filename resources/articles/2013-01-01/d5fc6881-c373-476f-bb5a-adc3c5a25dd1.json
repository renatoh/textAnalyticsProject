It appears to have \"COCK\" written in big blue letters along its flank. Has it been grafittied, offensively, by a rural yob with a spray can? Or is that the unfortunate name of the farmer who owns it? It could be COOK, I suppose. In which case is that the (less unfortunate) name of a farmer, or perhaps an instruction? Mmmm, with rosemary and garlic ... Admittedly, these are not the central questions of this interesting documentary, made by the same people who do Made in Chelsea. It's more about the next generation of British farmers and whether agriculture is actually a viable career for a young person today. This opening episode focuses on three young Herefordshire farmers. Specifically, it's about whether Robbie can turn round the fortunes of his mum's struggling pig farm; whether Ed, who left a swanky London job to go back to the family farm, will hang on to Tash, his swanky London girlfriend; and whether Nick will manage to get out of the business altogether. Nick is the best \u2013 in terms of TV, I mean, not farming. He does a nice comedy routine on the subject of livestock death. \"Quite a popular one for lambs at this time of the year is to jump in water troughs and drown,\" he says, doing the rounds of the fields on his quad bike. \"Ewes like to sort of generally collapse in a heap and die, that's quite popular. Getting stuck in brambles, that's always a favourite for a sheep suicide. Or lie there and let a crow peck its eyes and backside out, that's the other favourite.\" Eurgh. There seems to be some debate about whether or not crows actually do this. But yes, I'm beginning to see that farming may not be right for Nick. It's not as if his old job is totally different from farming, though, as we discover when he tries to get it back: he was an auctioneer at a livestock market. Maybe Nick just has a thing about animals and death. It was probably him who wrote on the sheep."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
