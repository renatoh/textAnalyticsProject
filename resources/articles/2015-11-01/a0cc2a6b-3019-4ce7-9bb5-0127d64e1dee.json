Bevan Stanley Cameron was found in his cell on 28 October at Casaurina prison, 35km south of Perth, according to a statement by WA Department of Corrective Services. He was taken to nearby Fiona Stanley hospital and underwent surgery but died on 2 November. The corrective services commissioner, James McMahon, expressed his condolences to Bevan\u2019s family and friends and said the death would be investigated by a coroner. It\u2019s the fourth Aboriginal death provisionally put down to be suicide by hanging at the prison since 20-year-old Jayden Stafford Bennell died on 6 March 2013. Aubrey Wallam, 31, died about 18 months later on 22 October 2014, and Mervyn Bell, 28, died on 8 September 2015. The families of each of those men are waiting for the coroner to set the date of their respective inquests. All four deaths occurred after the Department of Corrective Services advertised a $5m construction contract to minimise the number of ligature points at Casuarina prison. The work was put to tender in 2009 as part of a statewide program based on coronial recommendations after a death in custody at Roebourne prison in 2007, and was supposed to be completed in 2012. Cameron was one year into a seven and a half-year sentence for a number of offences including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, over an incident that culminated in him drunkenly crashing a stolen car and then running away, leaving his three-year-old daughter in the wreck. He pleaded guilty to the charges and his lawyer reportedly told the court that Cameron could not remember the crash but was deeply ashamed. He was being housed as a medium-security prisoner. Marc Newhouse, from the Death in Custody Watch Committee in WA, said the rate of Aboriginal deaths in WA prisons was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cThere has been a number of deaths in custody in WA over the last few months and it goes back for us to the efforts that the premier has been making, since he gave an undertaking to look at ways to reduce deaths in custody and reduce the number of Aboriginal people being jailed,\u201d Newhouse said. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s not working.\u201d The WA premier, Colin Barnett, gave that undertaking in November 2014 to the mother and grandmother of Ms Dhu, a 22-year-old Yamatji woman who died in custody the police lock-up at South Hedland, 1,500km north of Perth, on August 4, 2014. Since then the government has announced plans to introduce a telephone custody notification system and suggested court fines, which often result in jail time for people who cannot afford to pay, could be skimmed directly from welfare payments. Newhouse said it was particularly concerning to see another case of hanging. Reducing the risk of death by hanging was one of the key recommendations of the 1991 report into the royal commission into aboriginal deaths in custody. \u201cThe royal commission was how many years ago? And we are still dealing with basic things like ligature points,\u201d Newhouse said. The inquest into Ms Dhu\u2019s death, which was not suicide, was scheduled to start in South Hedland this month but has been moved to the central law courts in Perth because the 25 lawyers who are scheduled to appear would not be able to fit in the South Hedland courthouse. The state coroner on Friday refused an application by the Death in Custody Action Watch Committee to be an interested party at the inquest, which would have allowed it to cross-examine witnesses and submit evidence. Instead the committee has been granted leave to make a submission at the end of the hearing, which is expected to run for two weeks. \u2022 Lifeline 13 11 14"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
