Van Gaal hopes British football\u2019s most expensive player will continue at Old Trafford but acknowledged Di Mar\u00eda had not enjoyed a good campaign since signing from Real Madrid for \u00a359.7m. Di Mar\u00eda has lost his place in the starting XI and has also experienced a troubled time in his private life, his rented property suffering an attempted burglary while he and his family were inside. Since being sent off against Arsenal on 9 March Di Mar\u00eda has not started a match as United have turned in some of their finest displays under Van Gaal. \u201cThe manager and the club is always dependable on the opinion of the player himself,\u201d the Dutchman said of Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s future. \u201cThe player decides; we shall see what he decides. \u201cHe cannot say that he has had a marvellous season here. The decision is not only to him because now we have a contract, so we shall speak always with every player, evaluation, as I always do. Then we speak with each other about the future, and that is with every player.\u201d Di Mar\u00eda has made 23 starts, scoring four goals, and Van Gaal is hopeful the player\u2019s disappointing form may be down to a hangover from Argentina\u2019s 2014 World Cup campaign in which they reached the final. \u201cI hope. You cannot always say that is the main factor. Of course, it plays a role, and I hope it is that, because then we can have a fantastic season next season. You have to adapt to our philosophy and that is also difficult for him, probably. Normally he shall have a fantastic season, I believe in that.\u201d Van Gaal is working on the basis of having Di Mar\u00eda next season. \u201cI am pleased with his attitude, so that is not a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Di Mar\u00eda shall stay and he is working very hard.\u201d Asked if he expected more from him, Van Gaal said: \u201cA player has to contribute. What we expected, as a team and as a staff, from each other. Normally Di Mar\u00eda should have played but the last weeks he doesn\u2019t play any more and the team is winning. Now we are losing, so the chance of him coming back is higher; it is always like that. The issue that he is not always in the line-up is also for him a disappointment, but for me a disappointment. \u201cI like every player who wants to perform how we want him to perform. He can convince me of the way of playing, or I have to convince him and that is in every club \u2013 that is what I have done. I am not a dictator that says: \u2018You have to play like that.\u2019 No, you can play. But we have team functions and that is obligated to perform. You can play as you want to play but then I have to judge with other players in that position.\u201d Van Gaal reiterated that this close season will be crucial to United\u2019s hopes of challenging for next year\u2019s Premier League crown. \u201cThis summer is very important, of course \u2013 that I have already said. The balance of the selection and the preparation, but we are very busy with that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
