All interested parties had been given until midnight to make a formal bid after the American billionaire's \u00a362.6m offer was accepted 11 days ago. Neville's and Padfield's withdrawals means Lerner cannot now be challenged. The 44-year-old, who may attend Sunday's match against Newcastle at Villa Park, is set to formally replace Doug Ellis next month when the 21-day window that shareholders are given to return offer documents expires. Neville's decision follows doubts over the strength of his funding. He had initially led a consortium involving the Comer brothers but refused to reveal the identity of his new backers despite tabling an offer in excess of \u00a357m last month. Padfield had entered the takeover race late, although speculation had mounted that the AV06 consortium he was representing were prepared to respond to Lerner's bid by making an offer of around \u00a370m. He had also considered the possibility of merging with Neville's consortium but it is understood that the two groups made little progress in talks, leading to separate statements yesterday. \"I can confirm that the AV06 consortium will not be pursuing a counter bid for Aston Villa PLC,\" said Padfield. \"The reason for withdrawing is that the backers were not satisfied with the constraints which had been imposed on them in the making of a counter bid. I have met representatives of supporters' groups and was extremely impressed with their vision for the club under a new owner. The AV06 consortium is disappointed that that we will not be able to have the involvement which we had hoped in the fulfilment of the club's potential.\" Neville delivered a much longer message, which praised Ellis for his contribution at Villa and included the suggestion that his AVIL consortium had \"acted as a catalyst in bringing forward other bidders\". He insisted that funding had been in place but admitted the \"structure of that financing was not acceptable to the consortium or me\". Lerner, with his considerable personal wealth, would appear to have no such problem and Neville used his address to urge the Villa fans to throw their support behind the American. \"I have come to the conclusion that together with the brilliant Martin O'Neill as manager, Randy Lerner and his team have the right credentials, the necessary finances and the pooled resources to restore the club to where all of us supporters want to see it, and with that in mind, I have decided to end my consortium's approach in order not to jeopardise the takeover in any way,\" said Neville. \"I would also call upon all other potential bidders to stand aside and allow the will of the supporters to prevail.\" England's manager Steve McClaren today names his first squad for competitive action with Everton's Andy Johnson set to return as the pool's fourth striker for the European Championship qualifiers at home to Andorra a week tomorrow and in FYR Macedonia the following Wednesday in Skopje. With West Ham's Dean Ashton injured Johnson, who was monitored by McClaren in Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Blackburn, would be behind Darren Bent and the pair who started in the 4-0 win over Greece, Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
