A desperate scramble for a recording device later, we're in business] How are things? I suppose everything is being aimed at London 2012 right now? [On a very fuzzy line] Yeah, preparations are going quite well. I've had a good start to the season and I'm on track for next year. We'll take this year as a stepping stone, there's a couple of goals that I'd like to hit this season, so I think it'll end up being a successful year. You've been keeping pretty busy too, we noticed on your Twitter feed that you've been to Amsterdam, Venice and London in the last week. Yeah, I've had a busy time lately, setting up the season. After Manchester, I'm in Ostrava, then Portland, then New York then I'll be back here in the UK and Europe so it's a busy couple of months. Where's your favourite place to be? I must admit I quite like Mozambique, it's pretty unspoiled, pretty rural. It's a beautiful place, really low-key and down-to-earth and the people are friendly. I really enjoy it there, apart from the fact that there's no cell phone signal, although I guess that might be a perk. There are a couple of places that have captured my heart for different reasons, and that's one of them. You're going to be based in Italy for the season? Yeah, we're going to be based in Gemona, which is not far from Venice and Trieste. It's a beautiful city, very quiet, only about 1,500 people, but the facilities there are nice and it's quite central to fly anywhere in Europe so it'll be a nice place to stay. Now you're a Lazio fan \u2013will you have chance to get to the Stadio Olimpico? Yeah I should get some time for a game or two. I think being a Lazio supporter in Italy is not always a good thing, but it's a team that I've supported from a young age. A friend of mine's parents came from Rome and I used to go to their house at the weekend to watch the games and it became second nature for me to shout for them. So I've stuck to my guns there, though I must admit there's been some [CRACKLE, CRACKLE, CRACKLE] but there have been some good moments too. Did you manage to get to any World Cup matches? [CRACKLE, CRACKLE, CRACKLE continues ominously] I didn't unfortunately. Half of Europe went to South Africa, I think I was the only South African to come to Europe. I didn't get chance to see any, which was quite depressing for me, but I've made athletics my No1 priority so I have to make sacrifices. Speaking of sacrifices, you've lost a bit of weight I believe? [Chuckle] Yeah, I've been quite strong in the past but my power-to-weight threshold could have been better. I'm just about as strong as I was before, but I've lost a kilogram or two. It could make a real difference. What are your top dieting tips? My top [FUZZY CRACKLE] Yeah, if I was going to lose a few pounds [FUZZY CRACKLING ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE] what advice would you give me? [STATIC SILENCE] Can you repeat that? If I was going to lose a few pounds \u2026 Hello? Sorry the signal is very bad. I think [CRACKLEFUZZYSTATICSILENCE] Hello? [SILENCE] [He's gone. A few minutes later the phone rings] Hello? Unplanned tunnel. Sorry about that. Not a problem. Can't hold you responsible for the layout of the British railway system. You were about to tell me about your top dieting tips. Just lots of veggies and no carbs after seven at night. Sound advice. What would you cook us if we came round for dinner? If we weren't on a diet that is. Oooh. I'd make a homemade bread with jalapenos, then we'd have a lasagne and then molten [?] pudding with chocolate truffles for dessert. That sounds really good although I don't really remember what it tastes like. So are you a bit of a chef in the kitchen? Yeah, I lived by myself for a couple of years so I'm quite used to cooking and I really do enjoy it. You've got a racehorse as well. How did that happen? I've got a couple at the moment. I grouped up with a family who were very big on racehorses and I used to go and watch some races. The horseracing culture in South Africa is quite big. I've got a horse that won the Epsom Derby and the Dubai Duty Free \u2013 it's a really top-bred horse, so hopefully we're going to travel a bit with him I'm hoping. And when you're at the races do you stick your mortgage on the outsider or keep your powder dry? I'm not much of a punter, I just really enjoy the sport. It's a beautiful, beautiful sport. Horses aren't the only animals in your life. You've got a couple of white tigers too. Hahahaha. You've really done your research [this is the first time anyone has ever said this to Small Talk. Ever]. Yeah, I keep them in my house and they're getting a bit big now, the male is 200kg and the female 150 or 160, so I'm going to have to find something to do with them and I hope everything's in one piece when I get home. One question we always ask is 'Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?' and it seems you might be able to give us a definite answer. I think a tiger. They're both the same weight up front but not at the back and I think they're used to fighting by themselves, they don't fight in a pack. One-on-one they'd be best equipped for a fight. Your autobiography is Blade Runner \u2013 have you ever seen the film? I actually haven't. I've got it on my computer, so I need to watch it. I should, I really should. What's your favourite film then, if you haven't seen that one? I really like Guy Ritchie films, old Stanley Kubrick films, Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, those are the movies I really enjoy. Do you ever do karaoke? I did karaoke in a Chinese bar in [OMINOUS FUZZY DISTORTION] about three or four years ago but that was probably the first and last time, not because I didn't enjoy it but because the people in the bar didn't enjoy it. It was the one that goes [ADOPTS DEEP VOICE] \"You got me on my knees, baby. Doo doo do doo.\" Hey? Oh, we're going through a tunnel so if the phone cuts off. Ah, Eric Clapton \u2026 I don't know [FUZZY STATIC] pretty dodgy. [POP! CRACKLE! SILENCE \u2026] [Small Talk begins to wonder if he's just pretending about all these tunnels. Two minutes later, during which time Small Talk has been whistling Layla, the phone rings once more.] Hello, hello? [Very, very faint, and sounding slightly sad] Hi Small Talk, sorry about that. Not to worry. Let's get to the important stuff. Charlize Theron or Minky van der Westhuizen? Ooh, Minky van der Westhuizen. Yeah, she's [OBSCURED BY STATICFUZZ that ends with a happy cackle]. She's just got divorced recently, not that I follow all the social movements. Have you ever seen a UFO? I've probably thought that I've seen a UFO, but I don't think it would have been one. Might have been a bit late in the day or early in the morning. What would you put in Room 101? Room 101? Oof. Erm. Jeez. I don't think [FUZZYSTATIC] asked a question like that before. [STATICFUZZINESS] like a cocktail bar? Er, OK. This is becoming slightly impossible. Last of all then, can you tell us a joke? Yes. I should be able to tell you a joke. [FUZZ! FUZZ!] sure. I'm really slow today, nothing is coming to mind. [CCRRRACKLE STATIC! FUZZ! FUZZYSTATIC! Small Talk can just about make out something about letting a barking dog in to your house]. Great stuff. Possibly. Oscar thanks for your time. Thanks very much, Small Talk. Oscar Pistorius is a BT Ambassador and is taking part in the BT Storytellers campaign.
