This was a third consecutive defeat \u2013 and a month has passed since his side has beaten any team \u2013 a dire run of six matches. Perhaps most damning regarding this latest abject display is that there is no surprise. The progress engineered by Van Gaal in returning United to the Champions League and beginning a rebuilding of the squad has been stalling for most of the season. It finally halted when Wolfsburg knocked United out of Europe\u2019s top club competition and Bournemouth downed them in the following Premier League match. United came into this contest on the back of those two results. Van Gaal billed Norwich City\u2019s visit as must-win match but after a familiar opening 25-minute flurry his side became becalmed and their opponents proceeded to do what United just cannot: take their chances. For a manager with an autocratic streak Van Gaal\u2019s willingness to discuss how confidence is affecting his players is intriguing and opens the door further to self-doubt. It was the manager\u2019s explanation for the two terrible goals conceded. Cameron Jerome, on 38 minutes, and Alexander Tettey, on 54, proved ruthless but each should never have been allowed a chance. The opener arrived when Phil Jones missed a tackle on Nathan Redmond. This allowed a pass to Jerome along the right. The striker was a few feet inside United\u2019s half and a sluggish Chris Smalling lost the race to him, yet still Jerome might have been stopped. On cutting inside a covering Ashley Young tackled like the novice right-back he is and when Jerome shot, a weak David de Gea hand failed to stop the ball. The second strike was the result of another series of errors. On the occasion of his 500th appearance, Wayne Rooney should be troubled by how Tettey outmuscled him. He passed to Jerome and again Jones failed to get a foot in. When the ball was returned to Tettey, Young\u2019s amble when trying to close him down meant there was a universe of time for a toe-poke that beat De Gea once more \u2013 and Norwich were 2-0 up. Anthony Martial\u2019s quick feet inside a crowded area pulled one back with 24 minutes left. At the close Smalling had a golden chance to redeem himself and allow Van Gaal to sleep easier but his stooped header went wide. It was United\u2019s first defeat over 90 minutes at Old Trafford this season but Alex Neil\u2019s side had still arrived sniffing blood. Robbie Brady said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve been beaten at home this season. They are known for rolling teams over in the second half and they\u2019ve had some unbelievable comebacks but we caught them on the counterattack after that and I thought we held them well after they got the goal back.\u201d The careful playing style Van Gaal adheres to is detested by many United fans. It places high emphasis on guarding the ball, so to see how quickly possession was ceded to Norwich is a mark of the side\u2019s dysfunction. \u201cWe knew they would want to keep the ball but we were able to get the ball back a lot quicker than we expected sometimes,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt was a good game to be involved with. Things went well for us. \u201cThey were coming off the back of some poor results. They got beat last week. We thought they might come out quick to try to hurt us early on. They would have wanted to prove a point after last week but we managed to get the first goal against the run of play but second half we were more in it and created a few chances.\u201d United\u2019s sequence since Watford were defeated 2-1 on 21 November is 0-0 against PSV Eindhoven, 1-1 against Leicester City, 0-0 against West Ham United, 2-3 to Wolfsburg, 1-2 to Bournemouth \u2013 and now this reverse. It cannot continue for too much longer if Van Gaal wants to retain his job and the Boxing Day visit to Stoke City takes on particular magnitude. United have dropped to fifth place and given the Premier League was the club\u2019s priority over any other competition this season, including the Champions League, the manager is treading on precarious ground. Juan Mata said: \u201cWe tried. You always have to believe until the end that you can score, firstly to equalise and then win the game. Anthony Martial scored a good goal and after that we created chances but it was too late in the game. We couldn\u2019t do it and I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d As is everyone connected with the club. Van Gaal dare not lose at Stoke or to Chelsea two days later.
