Durham, who finished fourth in Division One last season, had their 11-year spell in the top flight ended last month when they were relegated and hit with a 48-point deduction from the start of next season as part of their \u00a33.8m bailout by the England and Wales Cricket Board. After sitting out the first round of fixtures, Paul Collingwood\u2019s side will host Nottinghamshire from 14 April \u2013 the visitors will also be adjusting to life in the second tier after finishing bottom of Division One \u2013 while the champions, Middlesex, begin their title defence on the same day away against Hampshire, the club saved by Durham\u2019s demotion. The English season will have a new look overall with the group stage of the Royal London Cup played in May - the final of which will be held at Lord\u2019s on 1 July - while the bulk of the NatWest T20 Blast will be played in two blocks across July and August before Finals Day at Edgbaston on 2 September. The most eye-catching change comes in the County Championship with the introduction of a round of nine day-night fixtures that will start from 26 June with England\u2019s cricketers free to play as they prepare for their first floodlit Test at home against West Indies at Edgbaston starting on 17 August. The floodlit round will have matches hosted by Essex, Hampshire, Warwickshire and Yorkshire in Division One and Durham , Glamorgan, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Sussex in Division Two, with Derbyshire also playing a three-day floodlit tour match against West Indies starting on 11 August. \u201cIt was important for us to arrange a full round of fixtures to give our England players the chance to experience the conditions,\u201d said Tom Harrison, the ECB\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut just as we wanted to assess the impact of making Test cricket more accessible by changing the hours of play, the counties have really embraced the potential of Championship matches that stretch well into the evening when people have finished school or work.\u201d Floodlit fixtures (all start 26 June) Division One Essex v Middlesex, Hampshire v Somerset, Warwickshire v Lancashire, Yorkshire v Surrey Division Two Durham v Worcestershire, Glamorgan v Derbyshire, Northamptonshire v Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire v Kent, Sussex v Gloucestershire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
