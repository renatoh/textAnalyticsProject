A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday revealed an internal complaint was made about the process that awarded the contract to the Indigenous and Remote Eye Health Service (IRIS) for the delivery of ophthalmology services in remote areas at twice the market rate. It came after a former chief of staff to Wyatt, Kate Johnson, went public with allegations that the minister fostered \u201ca culture of bullying in his office\u201d, which became the subject of a Department of Finance investigation. Glasson, who ran as the Liberal candidate against Kevin Rudd at the 2013 election, was a director of IRIS between 2016 and 2019, along with lobbyist Kerry Gallagher. The holding company of IRIS is called Vanguard Consulting. Vanguard Health has donated at least $21,000 to the Liberal National party of Queensland since 2009. In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for Wyatt said the contract to Vanguard was awarded \u201cfollowing advice provided by the Health Department\u201d on 1 August 2018. Initial briefs were signed by Wyatt on 9 August, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, on 15 August. The contract was approved on 24 August. \u201cThe Australian Society of Ophthalmologists \u2013 through Vanguard Health \u2013 was provided funding from the previous Labor federal government in 2010/11, to plan and develop a four-year plan for eye services (IRIS 1.0),\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThe IRIS proposal was assessed by the Indigenous Health Division, in line with the standard process for unsolicited proposals under the Indigenous Australians\u2019 Health program, and was assessed as suitable for the funding on the basis it would meet the unmet need for cataract surgery. \u201cGiven the pending delivery of the \u2018roadmap\u2019 for Indigenous Eye Health and relative value for money considerations, the department recommended the IRIS initiative be funded as a two-year trial, with an independent evaluation in the second half of year two to assess effectiveness and efficiency.\u201d The spokesman said that the department\u2019s advice was that \u201cthe initiative would deliver 500 eye procedures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the two years\u201d. To date, more than 300 remote operations have been carried out. According to the Herald\u2019s report, a staff member in Wyatt\u2019s office complained that \u201cthe company [Vanguard] has party connections\u201d and they \u201ccontacted every man and their dog\u201d over the contract. The staff member, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the Department of Finance that that \u201cjust because you\u2019re connected to the party doesn\u2019t mean you get written a blank cheque\u201d. Labor\u2019s assistant minister for Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the issue was a \u201cmatter of scrutiny\u201d for the Morrison government. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s a matter of scrutiny \u2013 whether that\u2019s scrutiny for the big banks, scrutiny for George Christensen, scrutiny for Ken Wyatt \u2013 they pull the covers over,\u201d Leigh said on Tuesday. \u201cThey say there\u2019s nothing thing to see here. A doona is the best metaphor for the Morrison government that anyone can come up. They\u2019re either asleep or pulling the covers over.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
