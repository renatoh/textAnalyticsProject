It's like Woody Allen without the wit. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower (12A) (Stephen Chbosky, 2012, US) Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller. 103 mins Life as a high-school outsider never looked so appealing as in this well-intentioned coming-of-ager, in which Lerman's loner is adopted by a band of bohemian outcasts. Watson's post-Potter moment is somewhat overshadowed by the flamboyant Miller. Sinister (15) (Scott Derrickson, 2012, US) Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, James Ransone. 110 mins Despite the old \"just moved into a house with a terrible history\" storyline, and a found-footage element, there's some well-engineered terror to be found here. Crime writer Hawke's efforts to get to the bottom of things inevitably drag us all into something really nasty. Taken 2 (12A) (Olivier Megaton, 2012, Fra) Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen. 91 mins The first movie left us in no doubt: if you kidnap a member of Neeson's family, he will find you and kill you. But some people never learn, so here we go again. Or don't, which would be the smarter option with this lame franchise-squeezer. Sparkle (12A) (Salim Akil, 2012, US) Jordin Sparks, Carmen Ejogo, Derek Luke. 116 mins Talented performers (including the late Whitney Houston) can't make up for the fact that we've seen this rags-to-riches Motown-ish melodrama before (when it was called Dreamgirls). Still, it looks and sounds good. Everything Or Nothing (12A) (Stevan Riley, 2012, UK) 98 mins A celebratory but thorough 50th anniversary documentary on the roots and power of the James Bond franchise, focusing on writer Ian Fleming and producers Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli, plus numerous ex-007s (but not Sean Connery). The Knot (15) (Jesse Lawrence, 2012, UK) Noel Clarke, Matthew McNulty. Talulah Riley. 92 mins This week's wedding farce comes with little to distinguish it from the last one. Still a long way from the British Bridesmaids they're all reaching for. Some Guy Who Kills People (15) (Jack Perez, 2011, US) Kevin Corrigan, Karen Black. 94 mins The childhood enemies of a grown-up smalltown loser mysteriously meet gruesome deaths in this smart little horror comedy, whose cult cast helps it strike the right tone. English Vinglish (PG) (Gauri Shinde, 2012, Ind) Sridevi, Adil Hussain, Mehdi Nebbou. 134 mins An Indian woman in New York finds self-esteem \u2013 and more \u2013 through her multicultural English class in this feelgood dramedy. Out from Friday Pusher British update of Drive director Nicholas Winding Refn's cult 90s Danish thriller. Much Ado About Nothing Filmed Shakespeare from London's Globe Theatre, with Eve Best and Charles Edwards. Out from Wed On The Road Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty finally hit the road, along with Kristen Stewart, in this adaptation of Jack Kerouac's novel. Hotel Transylvania Adam Sandler hosts a monster leisure resort in this horror-tinged family animation. Hit &amp; Run The past catches up with Dax Shephard's getaway driver in this action comedy. Private Peaceful Michael Morpurgo's first world war drama, ready for duty. Bhoot Returns Sequel to the Bollywood ghost story, this time in 3D. Coming soon In two weeks... Tim Burton's retro stop-motion horror Frankenweenie\u2026 Sundance winner Beasts Of The Southern Wild\u2026 In three weeks... Another resurrection for James Bond, in Sam Mendes's Skyfall\u2026 Shedding light on The Shining in Room 237\u2026 In a month...
