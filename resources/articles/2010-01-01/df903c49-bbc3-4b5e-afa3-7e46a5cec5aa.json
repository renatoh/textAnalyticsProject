Don't read on if you haven't seen episode two \u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that many UK viewers will not have done\u2026 Anna Pickard's episode one blog Showmance Feeling threatened by the glee club \u2013 and outraged by the fact they used her photocopier \u2013 cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester is looking to shut them down. So, having had it pointed out that the club needs 12 members to exist (they have six) Will Schuester attempts a recruitment drive that culminates in a disco school assembly sales pitch. The group rebels, performs Push It by Salt-N-Pepa, which works better. Meanwhile, to support his newly pregnant wife Terri, Will takes a second job as a school cleaner. Only she's not pregnant; the pregnancy was hysterical (as is Terri, who decides not to tell her husband). Programme notes Building on the televisular jacuzzi that was the first episode, Showmance adds extra bubbles just to prove that it can \u2013 and throws a disco ball in for good measure. The whole thing is full of unlikely happy moments. The sequence where Emma Pillsbury, guidance counselor (and possessor of a ridiculous crush on Mr Schue) finds Rachel in the bathroom attempting bulimia is unexpectedly fun. Yes I know, it doesn't sound it \u2013 but half the bathroom scene is shot from the inside of the toilet bowl, and then there are the leaflets in the guidance counselor's office. The camera flicks over DIVORCE: Why Your Parents Stopped Loving You; to the more generic RADON: The Silent Killer before finally settling on the most fitting, a primary coloured leaflet entitled So\u2026 You Like Throwing Up. The tension between Mr Schuester and Emma was flagged up in the first episode, and is developed here \u2013 though it promises to be doomed with Will's terrifying wife in the picture. Rachel's crush on Finn, on the other hand, seemed rather less likely to come to fruition \u2013 after all, writers of US TV shows usually drag these things out for months, perhaps years. But then, in episode two, they suddenly kiss. Done. You're already getting the sense that this is not about defying expectation as acknowledging it, satisfying it, then moving on to other brightly coloured shiny things. Perfect short attention span television, really, because ooooh, look over there! A butterfly! Still, the Finn/Rachel Berry (FinnBerry!) relationship will be done in by the new members of Glee if nothing else by next week. They may only have been doing it to make sure Finn isn't cheating on head cheerleader Quinn, but with three cheerios now in glee club, a nefarious plan is hatched by Sue: \"I need eyes on the inside. We're going to bring this club down from within,\" she says with true malice in her voice. \"And I'm going to get my boyfriend back\", adds Quinn. \"I don't care so much about that\", Sylvester tops off the conversation, dismissively. God, I love her. Gleefilled quotes Finn's chaste intentions: \"I'm still on the fence about celibacy club. I only joined to get into Quinn Fabray's pants.\" Ken Tanaka's touching and heartfelt pitch for Emma's heart: \"I'll treat you right, I'll put up with all your crazy, they can't fire me because I'm a minority and so I'll always be able to provide for you \u2013 you could do worse.\" Come now, who wouldn't melt? And the Sue Sylvester exchange of the week: \"Iron Tablet? Keeps your strength up while you're menstruating\u2026\" Mr Schuester: \"I don't menstruate.\" Sue Sylvester: \"Really? Neither do I.\" There's something so very straight-faced about the way Sue talks to Will woman-to-woman\u2026 Set Llist Le Freak, Gold Digger, Push It, Say A Little Prayer For You, and Take a Bow at the end, with a small clip of Emma wailing along to All by Myself in her car. Which all adds up to five and a bit songs \u2013 which seems paltry compared with the first episode. Performance of the week Arguably, Gold Digger (mainly because Mr Schuester suddenly stops being so very nice-but-dull when he starts performing). In second place: Take a Bow, although Artie (particularly) in Let's Talk About Sex also puts in a strong bid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
