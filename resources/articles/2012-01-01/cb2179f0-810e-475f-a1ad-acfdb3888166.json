Rahman's a formidable jazz pianist in post-Herbie Hancock territory, but she's also devoted to the lyricism of traditional songs, inspired on this set by both Irish folk music and the work of Bengali legend Rabindranath Tagore. John Fordham Moulettes Sing Unto Me Quirky, gently chilling and upbeat in tirn, Moulettes match fine female harmonies against cello, violin and bassoon. They were in excellent, unpredictable form at Gabby Young's New Year party at Southbank. Robin Denselow Body Language Holiday This is one of several exuberant, infectious tracks from the up-and-coming Brooklyn boy-girl foursome's debut album, Social Studies. Probably the best example of US disco-pop bearing that title since, well, Madonna's Holiday. Paul Lester Dodgy What Became of You Very strong, poignant comeback from the Britpop trio, indie rock geezers. The passing years have helped them invoke the essence of the Isley Brothers. Dave Simpson Minny Pops Trance Britain had Joy Division; Holland had Minny Pops. This track, from a rereleased 1981 live album, Standstill to Motion, is a doleful delight, its sonorous vocals conveying a sense of internal warfare. Caroline Sullivan Margo Guryan Someone I Know Singer-songwriter Margo Guryan doesn't interpolate Bach's Jesu just for kicks on this 1968 obscurity \u2013 the familiar melody helps conjure an enchanting sense of deja vu as the ethereal New Yorker sings of meeting a stranger she feels she's known her whole life. It's the sound of falling in love. Stevie Chick Spoon Don't Buy the Realistic Spoon's (below) potential for greatness was signalled early \u2013 the opening track of their first album, from 1997. It's a perfect fade-in to the moment when the guitars suddenly click into place with bass and drums, unveiling that perfect, spiralling riff. Michael Hann Guy Ropes and the Tent Pegs Burn Your Bras Girls It's hard to know where to start with the remarkable Lord of the Boot Sale blog, where Lorraine Chase's It's Nice 'Ere Innit? rubs shoulders with Mick Jagger's Memo from Turner, but this is particularly astonishing. A blunderingly offensive 1972 novelty record so of its time, you imagine DCI Gene Hunt laughing his head off as it plays.
