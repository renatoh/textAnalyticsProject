The club are briefing in Spain that a club director, Jos\u00e9 Angel S\u00e1nchez, has already spoken to David Dein directly to inform him they are interested in signing Vieira, and that a price of \u00a330m was what Arsenal will demand if Vieira insists on leaving. But the Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez is being cautious, having previously reached the stage of believing that Vieira had committed to moving to the club for the beginning of the 2002-3 season. On that occasion Vieira decided to spurn the approach and remain at Highbury - much to P\u00e9rez's annoyance. Therefore he wants to be absolutely clear on the Arsenal captain's attitude and asked a lawyer, who is commonly used by the club for such high-level intermediary work, to establish exactly what Vieira has told Arsenal and to what degree he is intent on selecting Madrid over others, such as Internazionale and Chelsea, who dearly covet his signature. The lawyer was told that Vieira's stance was based purely on his fear that both Arsenal and the Premiership have become comfort zones for him where the challenge is too repetitive and easily hurdled to take the player to the next stage in his personal development - and where the Champions League trophy always beckons but never arrives. Vieira intends to clear the air with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger directly this week, having informed him of his wish to leave in a telephone call after France's disastrous exit in the quarter-final of Euro 2004. As Madrid juggle other options which include Roma's Brazilian midfielder Emerson and Porto's Ricardo Carvalho, it emerged that P\u00e9rez's belief that only creative players can be gal\u00e1cticos means that Vieira is viewed as fitting on the second tier of the club's pay scale. It still means that he would earn more than he does at Arsenal - but that he would earn less than Beckham, Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, R\u00e1ul, Ronaldo and Luis Figo, plus any further gal\u00e1cticos who might be brought in. That would be a hurdle for Vieira, who knows where he stands in the world football pecking order and would need to change his attitude before going full out to persuade Arsenal he is ready to leave. Martin Keown has completed his move to Leicester having been released by Arsenal at the end of last season and has been joined at the Walkers Stadium by David Connolly, who has left West Ham for \u00a3500,000. Norwich are in talks with the Danish defender Thomas Helveg, who is available on a free transfer after leaving Internazionale. Portsmouth's midfielder Amdy Faye looks set to stay at Fratton Park after the breakdown of his proposed \u00a33m move to Fulham. Tottenham have reached an agreement with Grasshoppers Zurich to sign Reto Ziegler when the Swiss season ends in January. The left-sided 18-year-old is currently with the Switzerland squad having played every game in their run to the semi-finals of the European Under-19 Championship. Spurs' sporting director Frank Arnesen said: \"Reto is a very young player who has played at the highest level in Switzerland. A lot of big European clubs tried to sign him. I am delighted that we could.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
