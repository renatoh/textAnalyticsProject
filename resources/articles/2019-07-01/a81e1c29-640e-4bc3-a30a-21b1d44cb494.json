The Institute for Government (IfG) warned there is \u201cno such thing as a managed no deal\u201d and the hard Brexiters predictions of a \u201cclean break\u201d from the EU will not materialise. Johnson will begin his first full week in Downing Street by ramping up planning for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, with more than \u00a31bn to be announced within days for preparations by Sajid Javid, the chancellor. He sent out a raft of cabinet ministers over the weekend to talk about \u201cturbo-charging\u201d preparations as part of a publicity blitz, making clear that the UK will be heading for no deal unless EU leaders agree to replace the Irish backstop. The new prime minister is also heading to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the coming days to promise to \u201cstrengthen the union\u201d, but he faces a difficult meeting with Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, on Monday as she warned over the weekend that she cannot sign up to his no-deal Brexit strategy. In its report on no deal, the IfG predicted that the union of the United Kingdom would come under \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with Northern Ireland \u201cmost acutely affected\u201d. It said that legislation to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland with immediate effect would be needed to get through a no-deal Brexit if the devolved government is not restored by the end of October. \u201cJohnson may well find that having left one political union, he spends an increasing proportion of his time trying to keep another together,\u201d it said. The IfG, which has offices next to the Foreign Office near St James\u2019s Park, has regular access to lawmakers and top officials enabling it to give frank assessments on all aspects of government. Its publication comes just days after Johnson unveiled plans for a high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds, 20,000 new police officers and extra money for social care and schools. The pledges appear designed to appeal to the public in an election, fuelling speculation that Johnson is preparing for one even though he is publicly ruling it out before Brexit happens. However, the report outlines just how uncertain the future would be for Boris Johnson after a crashout, suggesting everything other than Brexit would be overshadowed. In another sign of the uncertainty Johnson faces, the owner of Vauxhall warned on Sunday that it will close its Ellesmere Port plant with the loss of 1,000 jobs if Brexit renders it unprofitable. \u201cNo deal is a step into the unknown: the prime minister\u2019s second 100 days will be even more unpredictable than his first,\u201d the report says, adding that the EU is unlikely to agree to negotiate any \u201cside deals\u201d to soften the impact. \u201cRather than \u2018turbo-charging\u2019 the economy, as Johnson has suggested, the government is more likely to be occupied with providing money and support to businesses and industries that have not prepared or are worst affected by a no-deal Brexit \u2013 as well as dealing with UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens here, who have been similarly caught out,\u201d it says. The authors reveal that the government\u2019s planning assumptions are \u201clocked away on secret computers known as Rosa terminals\u201d across Whitehall in classified documents but warns that \u201cas the name suggests these are just assumptions\u201d. Nobody can predict how the country, businesses and ordinary voters will react to no deal, something the IfG has been saying for some time, say the authors, Joe Owen, Maddy Thimont Jack and Jill Rutter. \u201cThe risk registers that exist across Whitehall for a no-deal Brexit may have detailed plans for how to manage anticipated risks. \u201cBut some of the biggest potential headaches will come from those issues that have not been foreseen,\u201d the reports concludes. With Labour, the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats and up to 40 backbench Tories all pledging to fight a no-deal Brexit, Johnson has begun a campaign to try to convince the public and MPs that his government will be ready if necessary. No 10 revealed that Johnson has tasked a series of new cabinet committees with preparing for no deal, with overall responsibility going to Michael Gove, effectively now a minister without portfolio. The prime minister spoke to his cabinet at lunchtime on Sunday to outline a new \u201cdaily operations committee\u201d codenamed XO. It will be chaired by Gove and meet in the Cobra emergency situation room, with live actions, deadlines and lines of accountability on screens at every meeting. Others involved include an all-male lineup of Javid; the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab; the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay; and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. There will be two other Brexit committees chaired by the prime minister \u2013 an exit economy and trade committee \u2013 meeting regularly, and an exit strategy committee meeting twice weekly. Dominic Cummings, the mastermind behind Vote Leave, who has been hired as Johnson\u2019s special adviser, has been tasked with delivering Brexit \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. In a meeting with fellow special advisers, he made it clear that he believes No 10 can outmanoeuvre parliamentary critics of no deal and force Brexit to happen by 31 October. However, leading former cabinet ministers \u2013 Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart \u2013 are all preparing to join the cross-party battle to make sure parliament has a say on the form of the UK\u2019s departure. One source close to the group said Cummings\u2019s confidence of being able to proceed with a no deal if necessary was \u201cmisplaced\u201d, while another former cabinet minister described the senior No 10 adviser as a \u201cmaster of disinformation and spin\u201d. The IfG report warned that Johnson\u2019s emergency efforts, now led by Cummings and Gove, will drain the capacity of Whitehall and government and crowd out his ambitions for domestic reforms. It pointed out that Theresa May said her priority was stamping out \u201cburning injustices\u201d when she assumed power and Johnson\u2019s ambitions could similarly be stymied. \u201cDeal or no deal prime ministers need time, capacity and political capital to spend on their priorities,\u201d the authors say, warning how a Brexit crisis could swamp efforts. \u201cBrexit is likely to preoccupy the work of the civil service for years to come. There will be at least 16,000 officials working on it by the autumn, and that number could still increase,\u201d it says. \u201cDelivering a no-deal Brexit would leave the prime minister with little space for an ambitious domestic agenda. \u201cWhitehall would be working flat out on Brexit for months, with many areas of work extending for years,\u201d the report adds. No matter how keen Johnson and his new team are to institute a new domestic agenda, \u201cmajor showdowns in parliament would continue, on the budget or Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 both due shortly after 31 October\u201d, says the report. \u201cThe difficult choices that have been unresolved for the last three years will not evaporate overnight on 31 October. And Brexit will remain the key dividing line in a parliament in which Johnson\u2019s government has a wafer-thin majority, and one that is constantly under threat,\u201d it concludes. In the coming weeks, it says the whole of government must shift to no-deal planning with thousands of civil servants moved to operational no-deal centres immediately. The report also suggests an emergency Brexit budget may be needed in the autumn, something the new chancellor is said to be looking at already. A second report by the Confederation of British Industry out on Monday will say neither the UK nor the EU are ready for no deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
