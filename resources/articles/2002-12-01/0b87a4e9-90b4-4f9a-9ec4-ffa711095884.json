The 18-year-old will spend a week in Spain from December 31 practising on clay. Bogdanovic will be joined by Miles Maclagan, who was a surprise call-up to play in the doubles with Tim Henman last September when Britain defeated Thailand 3-2 to retain their place in the elite world group, comprising the leading 16 nations. Neither Henman, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, nor Greg Rusedski, who missed the Thailand match with a foot injury that later needed an operation, are certain to play in either the Australian Open, which begins on January 13, or the Davis Cup tie in Sydney from February 7-9. Roger Taylor, Britain's Davis Cup captain, was always going to include Maclagan in his plans but the inclusion of Bogdanovic pushes the youngster ahead of several more experienced players. It is a further indication that Taylor believes the talented but raw left-hander, who was born in Belgrade, has considerable potential. Rusedski and Henman both began hitting this week, with Rusedski due to play in the Doha tournament starting on December 30, although that appears increasingly unlikely. Henman's return is currently scheduled for the pre-Australian Open exhibition event in Kooyong. \"If they are fit then they would be carrying the workload but it's early days at the moment to speculate on their fitness,\" said Taylor. \"We just have to take it week by week.\" Taylor's name has been mentioned, along with Henman's former coach David Felgate, among those who may take over from France's Patrice Hagelauer, who resigned this week as the LTA's performance director. \"There is currently no shortlist,\" said a spokesperson for the LTA yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
