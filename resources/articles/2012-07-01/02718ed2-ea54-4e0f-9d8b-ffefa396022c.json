Despite last month's pledge by ministers to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families, who cost the state \u00a39bn a year, the study shows the impact of cuts will mean such households lose \u00a33,000 a year by 2015 with the poorest and most vulnerable households bearing the burden of austerity measures. The research was commissioned by Action for Children, the NSPCC and the Children's Society, which claim ministers have lost sight of children in their policies. Once the government's cuts programme is fully implemented by 2015 \u2013 only 12% have taken place so far \u2013 the study says the effect on the poor will be dramatic. The number of troubled families will rise to 150,000 by 2015 and the number of children in troubled families will jump to 365,000, up by more than 50,000. The government's troubled families unit is investing \u00a3448m in a scheme that aims to change the lives of 120,000 troubled families by 2015. However, its work focuses on cutting truancy, antisocial behaviour and ending worklessness. Andrew Flanagan, chief executive of the NSPCC, said rhetoric used by ministers claimed that \"it's the adults who are feckless\". But he said: \"Children did not get themselves into that situation [to be in a troubled family]. Maybe the government's strategy might work a long way into the future. But, here and now, children are suffering the consequences.\" The research shows there were 130,000 troubled families in Britain in 2008 \u2013 those which had five or more of the seven indicators of \"multiple disadvantage\": no parent in the family in work; living in overcrowded conditions; no parent with any qualifications; mother suffering from mental health problems; at least one parent with a long-standing illness or disability; an income below the poverty line; and an inability to afford a number of food and clothing items. Dame Clare Tickell, the chief executive of Action for Children, said those suffering four disadvantages would amount to more than a million by 2015. Matthew Reed, the Children's Society chief executive, said that would mean \"three children in every classroom in the UK would be in households where parents were making choices between breakfast and dinner, heating the house or having shoes for schools\". The analysis shows the most extremely troubled families, those with six or more disadvantages, carry the biggest burden of the budget cuts. Even with the government's new universal credit, putatively designed so that no household is worse off, \"extremely troubled\" families lose 8% of their income a year. Fewer than 50,000 children live in such households now, but the figure will almost double to 96,000 by 2015. The report makes it clear that the poor rely to a far greater extent on the state than any other section of society and while the study recognises the government has introduced new measures, such as the pupil premium and extra childcare for disadvantaged two-year-olds, \"they do not fully compensate for the overall cuts in spending\". The government said Labour had spent \u00a3150bn on benefits and tax credits, but \"too many families have been systematically failed by the system\". The Department of Work and Pensions said: \"Only by reforming the welfare system and breaking the cycle of worklessness and dependency will we improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities. That is why we are introducing the universal credit which will simplify the complex myriad of benefits and lift 350,000 children and 550,000 adults out of poverty\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
