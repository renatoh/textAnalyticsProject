This is how racism works. But the other \u201cism\u201d is far less discussed, which is why Guardian US decided to dedicate an entire series to \u201ccolourism\u201d this year. To this day, colourism across the world remains taboo. The term is defined as the discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone. This means that darker skinned people of colour have to fight prejudice even within their own community, where lighter skin is seen as more desirable. In the US, it was born out of slavery, where lighter-skinned enslaved black women and their children \u2013 often the result of rape by slave masters \u2013 were given preferential treatment. This lingered through centuries and, to this day, lighter skin is associated with wealth and power, giving privileges to those who have it. We explored the topic through the lens of 27 black women \u2013 writers, illustrators, photographers, activists, artists and mothers. The series, Shades of Black, was read by 1.2 million of you, and was nominated in September for a prestigious ONA award. Shades of Black included an original video and photographic work, personal essays, and a longform piece featuring captivating personal experience validated by expert sources and data. Dream McClinton, a Guardian fellow at the time, said that while writing her piece, Dark-skinned Black Girls Don\u2019t Get Married, she often felt drained and defeated. \u201cHearing the levels of oppression women like me face for something so mundane and arbitrary like skin tone, there were moments where I would require a hug or just walk away from my desk altogether,\u201d she said. Reporting on the story required McClinton to confront the uncomfortable idea that her skin tone made her less attractive to men. She explained her feeling that the dating pool was limited \u201cbecause of something as arbitrary as shoe size\u201d. This is supported by data: a 2003 study (the Multi-City Study of Urban Equality) showed that among 16- to 19-year-olds 55% of light-skinned women were married, while only 23% of dark-skinned women had tied the knot. These numbers did stay in McClinton\u2019s mind, but she finally decided to try her hand at online dating, which is how her piece ends \u2013 with some hope. Although it was understandably difficult for McClinton to continue writing over nearly two months, the process also seemed cathartic. As she contributed work on the overall series in addition to her own story, she spoke with many powerful, confident, smart, dark-skinned women who encouraged her not to let others\u2019 judgment about appearance stifle her in any way. That was a positive change from where she had found herself a few months earlier, when she wrote a personal blog about her lack of hope in finding love, and first mentioned it to our editing team. We liked this premise, and felt the unexplored nature of the topic made it vital to investigate. Summer Sewell recognised instantly that we were looking at just the tip of the iceberg. It felt like a wealth of experiences were lurking just under the surface, ready to be offered to a wide audience \u2013 not just didactically to a white audience, but also to a black one, as well as other minorities. We hoped that those affected by colourism would engage in and prompt a conversation among themselves about their own lived experiences, and even their biases. Sewell also came to understand the importance placed on skin tone at a young age, although her experience is not the same as McClinton\u2019s. Her observations of those around her made it clear that colourism was an extension of racism, and just as sinister. To tackle this complex issue, we asked eight women with varying skin tones to talk candidly about their experiences for our video, we found overwhelmingly that self-love is the key to be able to fight the feelings of inadequacies colourism can engender, even though, as one woman stated: \u201cI have stood next to two [lighter-skinned] friends and people have literally not said hello to me because they don\u2019t see me.\u201d This feeling was often described by our essay writers as all-encompassing, and something that touched every area of their lives: from dating, parenting, activism to wearing make up or even toxic lightening creams. But would the topic hit a nerve with our readers? The answer is a resounding yes. When we asked readers to share their own experiences with colourism, we received hundreds of messages from people of colour in different countries detailing the doubt and lack of self worth \u2013 and in some cases, privilege \u2013 that colourism forces them to sort through every day. A reader wrote to say that in India a woman is judged by the colour of her skin from birth. Another in the UK wrote that \u201cmany black girls I pursued told me that they were only attracted to light-skin black boys\u201d, while another confessed that their mother was ashamed of their skin: \u201cAt school, in mosque and at family gatherings, I was demonised.\u201d As for McClinton, she says that the fact the project resonated with so many of our readers of colour was bittersweet: sweet because there\u2019s strength in numbers, and she is pleased the issue is being explored and reported on; but bitter because of the long-term suffering as a result of our ignorance. To have 30 women tackling this prejudice and laying their pain bare for the world was beautiful and brave and a conversation that needs to be addressed as publicly and as frankly as possible. McClinton writes: \u201cOur voices are present, our skin is radiant, and we will not be ignored any more. We are valid and beautiful and strong, even if the world refuses to acknowledge it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
