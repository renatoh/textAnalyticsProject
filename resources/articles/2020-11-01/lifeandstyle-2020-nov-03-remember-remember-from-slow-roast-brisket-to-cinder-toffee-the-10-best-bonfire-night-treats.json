Gone are the big gatherings. Gone is the sense of community spirit. Gone are my neighbours deciding that my children\u2019s bedtime is the best time to get their friends over and let off the world\u2019s loudest firework display. This year, Bonfire Night will be smaller and more household-focused than usual. But it doesn\u2019t mean that all traditions have to be lost. If nothing else, we can always eat like it\u2019s a typical Bonfire Night. Bonfire food has only three defining principles. It needs to be warming. It needs to be seasonal. And, most of all, it needs to be easy to eat standing up, ideally while wearing mittens. Here are 10 of the best. Baked potatoes We\u2019ll start with a Bonfire Night essential. A jacket potato is simple, warm and can be handheld. \u201cThe only ones that don\u2019t seem to work are those that are fiddled with. By which I mean those occasions when I\u2019ve been tempted by suggestions to bake them in foil, pierce all over with a fork or cook on a fancy trivet,\u201d writes Nigel Slater, so it\u2019s his fault-free recipe we\u2019ll use here. Chilli con carne Of course, the potato is just a vehicle for a fat dollop of toppings \u2013 and few are more seasonally appropriate than chilli con carne. Sorted Food\u2019s recipe is made with brisket and slow-cooked for four hours. The result is rich and thick and promises to stick to your guts until long after the sparklers have gone out. Baked sausages with harissa and tomatoes Back to Slater, whose recipe for gussied-up sausage and beans \u2013 scorched with the warming notes of harissa \u2013 seems tailor-made for a cold November evening. \u201cI like a coarse-cut, spicy sausage to cook with haricot beans,\u201d he says. \u201cThe pork, fennel seeds and black-pepper-seasoned sausages that hang in Italian grocers, displayed in plump clusters tied together with string, to be exact.\u201d Campfire crescent dogs Then again, if you want to incorporate the fire into your dining experience, a crescent dog seems the most sensible option. This is a hotdog sausage wrapped in shop-bought croissant dough and roasted over the fire on a skewer. Providing you trust your children around uncontrollable infernos, this is a great option for parents. Pumpkin soup If you would like a lighter option, there is always the opportunity to make a seasonal soup. The beauty of Barney Desmazery\u2019s pumpkin soup is that it\u2019s quick to make, easy to scale up and keeps for ages. You could make a bucket of this stuff now for warming up on 5 November. Marshmallows Cold November nights aren\u2019t really for dazzling guests, but, if you wanted to go upmarket, you could try making your own marshmallows instead of buying them. If nothing else, William Drabble\u2019s version contains quite a lot of Pernod, which can\u2019t be said for Rocky Mountain Mega marshmallows. S\u2019mores When you have marshmallows, you can make s\u2019mores. Again, these gloopy, squidgy chocolate-and-marshmallow cookie or cracker sandwiches can be assembled from shop-bought ingredients, but Anna Jones has a recipe that calls for homemade ginger biscuits. \u201cThe stuff of dreams,\u201d she says. Cinder toffee Gnawing on a lump of honeycomb is as much a Bonfire Night tradition as gorging on baked potatoes. Tamal Ray\u2019s version substitutes the traditional black treacle (\u201ctoo overpowering\u201d) for a more mellow hit of date syrup. Parkin Good news! With all that leftover black treacle, you can make parkin. This sweet, oaty gingerbread cake is exactly right for this time of year: sugary enough to count as a treat, but substantial enough to serve as genuine ballast. Felicity Cloake\u2019s recipe is one of the best you\u2019ll find, but act fast: as she says, \u201cparkin is one of those cakes, like malt loaf, that carries on getting better for some weeks after making\u201d. Toffee apples We\u2019ll end with probably the most divisive item of all, the toffee apple. Some may see them as a morally offensive and difficult-to-eat collision of antipathetic textures, but this is Bonfire Night and you can\u2019t argue with tradition. Especially when \u2013 as with this recipe, in which the apples are skewered on twigs and shot through with red dye \u2013 they look so beautiful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
