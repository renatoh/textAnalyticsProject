At an angry parliamentary Labour party meeting, senior figures including John Cryer and John Spellar said the party\u2019s deputy leader was being wrongly vilified in anonymous attacks from sources close to the leader\u2019s office. It followed a day of accusations and counterclaims by Watson and Corbyn allies over whether Momentum has a plan to increase its influence with the help of Unite. On Monday morning, Watson spoke to the media about comments by Momentum\u2019s founder, Jon Lansman, who was secretly recorded addressing supporters at a meeting of a new branch in London this month. Watson had demanded that McCluskey respond to a secret recording claiming that the union would fund an expansion of activities by Momentum if he were re-elected as general secretary. In response, Labour sources briefed that Corbyn was \u201cpretty much unanimously supported\u201d in a shadow cabinet meeting in \u201cslapping down\u201d Watson over his intervention. At the PLP meeting on Monday night, some MPs cheered when Watson entered the room. Cryer, the chair of the parliamentary party, said he was at the shadow cabinet meeting and that the briefing bore \u201cno relation\u201d to what had happened. Spellar and David Winnick, the leftwing MP for Walsall North, both demanded to know who had sanctioned the briefing against Watson. Corbyn, who attended the meeting to support Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, said he did not know who had briefed the media. One source said: \u201cThis was more like a meeting from the early 80s. The parliamentary party is broken. The split is out in the open, but the briefings aren\u2019t.\u201d In an unusual acknowledgment of the day\u2019s bruising rows, Corbyn released a short recorded clip on Monday night calling for unity and insisting that Labour can still be a force in British politics. \u201cSometimes spirits in the Labour party can run high. Today has been one of those days,\u201d he said. \u201cMy plea to all Labour party members, whether grassroots or in senior positions, is: think of our people, first; think of our movement, first; think of the party, first,\u201d he said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday morning, Watson said Lansman had \u201coutlined a hard-left plan to control the Labour party after Jeremy [Corbyn]\u2019s departure\u201d. He said: \u201cI regard this as a battle for the future existence of the Labour party. This is high stakes, and I hope my fellow members are going to understand that.\u201d It was vital for Labour and Unite members who opposed Momentum\u2019s ambition to take action, Watson said. \u201cI think this is so serious. I think it\u2019s vital that ordinary members of Unite are made aware of this plan, that they know what\u2019s going on inside their union, and they take action to block it.\u201d Watson said he was shocked at the ideas outlined. \u201cI thought that Momentum were changing. What Jon Lansman has outlined is a plan with Len McCluskey, the leader of Unite, to take control of the Labour party.\u201d McCluskey had to show leadership over the issue, Watson said: \u201cWe could do with him trying to understand how important this is.\u201d The acting general secretary of Unite, Gail Cartmail, said Watson should stop interfering in Unite\u2019s leadership election. Ballot papers for the leadership vote will be sent out to union members by the end of this week. \u201cHe [Watson] didn\u2019t seek to validate the allegation and he could have picked up the phone and I would have put his mind at rest,\u201d she said. Asked whether Unite would affiliate with Momentum, Cartmail said there were no such plans, but did not respond to a question asking whether the union would rule out giving money in the future. Hours after appearing on radio, Watson was criticised at a shadow cabinet meeting in Euston. Corbyn\u2019s allies, including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, shadow defence minister Emily Thornberry and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, rounded on Watson for speaking out. Watson\u2019s intervention was defended by others, including the health spokesman, Jon Ashworth, and the housing spokesman, John Healey. One attendee said Thornberry \u201clost it\u201d while criticising Watson during a lunch break, \u201cbut he gave as good as he got\u201d. In the hours after the meeting, sources briefed the media saying Watson had ignited a \u201cwar\u201d when the party should be concentrating on the local elections. \u201cThe irony of Watson\u2019s careless behaviour is that with antics like this, he risks the outcome of local elections and mayoral elections. He is on an ego trip,\u201d one said. \u201cJeremy was supported pretty much unanimously in the shadow cabinet in slapping down Watson for what has been seen as a reckless intervention designed to influence Unite\u2019s general secretary election,\u201d another source added. Corbyn and Watson attempted to quell the row by releasing a short statement that appeared to distance the Labour leader from Lansman\u2019s comments while calling for unity. \u201cThe leadership represents the whole party and not any one strand within it. No one speaks for the leadership except the leadership themselves and their spokespeople,\u201d it said. However, the PLP meeting at 6pm quickly turned on Corbyn, sources said. In a swipe at Corbyn, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, addressing the meeting, said: \u201cNever forget, the best way to represent and deliver for working people will always be from the government benches.\u201d After the meeting, the former Labour MP Lord Watts confronted Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s head of communications, and told him he was \u201ca disgrace\u201d. Speaking afterwards, a leadership source described the PLP meeting as \u201crobust\u201d, and denied that the leader\u2019s office was behind the briefings against Watson. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been giving no such briefings. You\u2019ll know as well as we do that after PLP meetings in particular and after other Labour party meetings there\u2019s often briefing that goes on, and the message that Jeremy gave to the meeting is that we need to be a united party and we need to be talking about the issues that affect our voters. A statement from the union said Watson\u2019s comments were extraordinary and added: \u201cFor the record, Len McCluskey has never met Jon Lansman to discuss this or any other matter.\u201d Unite later confirmed that in August, Lansman attended a meeting of around 20 people including McCluskey and Corbyn at the union\u2019s headquarters in Esher, Surrey, but insisted that the gathering was informal. The election of Unite\u2019s new leader is being watched closely by all sides of the Labour movement. McCluskey is Corbyn\u2019s close ally, while the union is Labour\u2019s biggest corporate funder. If McCluskey wins, the union\u2019s votes and influence could help to introduce rule changes that will help the party\u2019s left maintain power if Corbyn steps down. Momentum has had close connections with Unite since the group was established to support Corbyn\u2019s first leadership election campaign in 2015, according to insiders. At the organisation\u2019s national steering committee meeting in February 2016, Lansman told Momentum supporters that Unite wanted to support the group, but would only do so if it only had Labour supporters as members, sources said. For over a year, Lansman has been involved in a power struggle for control of Momentum with Trotsykist and hard-left factions, who wanted to keep the group\u2019s membership open to non-party members. Lansman eventually won the power struggle by mounting a so-called \u201ccoup\u201d in January which means that all Momentum members from this summer will have to be Labour supporters too. Lansman wanted Unite\u2019s support to increase influence over Labour, according to former Momentum comrades. \u201cHe knows that Unite\u2019s support is necessary to control the levers of power,\u201d one said. A spokesperson for Momentum denied there was any secret plot to take over Labour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
