There is a principle that those who commit offences against serving officers receive harsher than normal sentences \u2013 see for instance the 20- and 40-year stretches recently given to the accomplices of Raoul Moat. If we are to accept the justice of this, surely police officers found to have brought their service into disrepute should be subjected to a severer penalty than mere dismissal. Nigel Rayment London \u2022\u2008Seumas Milne says that British colonialism bears some responsibility for the current sorry state of the West Bank and Gaza (Comment, 6 April). This flies in the face of the facts. Britain spent 20 years restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine. It then lost over 800 soldiers, police and government officials trying to stop the state of Israel being founded. As a Palestinian old enough to remember once said to me: \"I like the British \u2013 they're the only people who tried to stop my country being stolen.\" Graeme McIver Bolton, Lancashire \u2022\u2008Reading your report on Ofsted's latest findings (Schools failing to help girls escape career stereotypes, 12 April), I picked up my pen to write about how single-sex schools encourage and allow girls to pursue non-stereotypical subjects, activities and, yes, career paths too. But, hang on a minute, what about the boys? Has Ofsted done a survey on how schools encourage boys to escape their stereotypical career paths? And if not, why not? Dr Helen Wright President, Girls' Schools Association \u2022\u2008Gerald Ronson's Heron Tower, we are told (Financial, 13 April) has \"a large aquarium populated by four bamboo sharks and 1,200 other fish\". Is this to be construed as a warning to those who would mess with capitalism?
