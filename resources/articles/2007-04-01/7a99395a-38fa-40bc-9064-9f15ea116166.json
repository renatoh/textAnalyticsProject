Until fairly recently, the size of the annual Levy payment from the betting industry was often decided at one minute to midnight on the final day of negotiation, while the contracts to set up the original Attheraces satellite channel and to keep racing on Channel 4 also went to extra time and penalties. So it is tempting to assume that something will turn up to resolve the current wrangle over the broadcast of live pictures in betting shops, even though an end to blanket coverage in every shop in the land is less than two weeks away. The bookies must want to show races from tracks like Ascot, Newbury, Chester and Goodwood. The punters surely want to bet on them. Common sense insists that there is a deal to be done. But common sense would need sat-nav to find its way through the tangle of claim, counter-claim, threat and bluster that surrounds the attempt by Turf TV - effectively, the 30 tracks that formed the Racing UK channel, plus Ascot - to break SIS's 20-year monopoly on broadcasting to betting shops. And even if it managed to get from A to B, it seems that the process has already passed the point of no return. Wars have been known to start for no better reason than that a country has spent so much on its armed forces that it cannot leave them idle. And Turf TV may now be in much the same position, since well-informed speculation suggests the company has agreed to buy 10,000 set-top boxes to be given away to its subscribers, which is enough for every betting shop in the country with at least a thousand to spare. It therefore seems unlikely that Turf TV could stop its breakaway now even if it wanted to, so if you want to watch the \"shoulder races\" - those not covered by terrestrial television - at several major tracks between now and December 31, you need to find one of their subscribers. Once you have managed that, you may decide to save on travel expenses in future by renting a flat nearby. The new year, meanwhile, will see all 31 courses drop off the SIS schedule and will be the point at which the major chains must decide whether to pay up for the Turf TV service or soldier on with SIS alone, offering approximately half of the live racing that their customers currently enjoy. By then, the major bookies will have had nine months to crunch the numbers. They say that you can't put a price on quality but the accountants at Ladbrokes, Hills and elsewhere will do their best. And this is when the enormity of Turf TV's gamble could become apparent. All courses signed to SIS get \u00a34,200 per race, which Turf TV will match when they take over the broadcasting rights. For a significant number of tracks, this is probably the difference between existence and closure, and unless a significant number of bookies take the Turf TV service, the courses will merely be paying their own money to themselves. Turf TV's tracks are betting that their product is so valuable to the bookies that in the long term they will be forced to cough up. If it is not, some of them could go to the wall. Could Bangor-on-Dee, for instance, really afford a cut in its turnover of about \u00a3400,000 a year? There is nothing wrong with a punt, of course, in racing above all. There is also a useful maxim, however, that you shouldn't bet with stakes that you can't afford to lose. Ron Cox's tip of the day Fluff 'N' Puff 4.40 Chepstow Despite his veteran status, Fluff 'N' Puff has held his form well since joining Andy Turnell at the start of this season and, with the yard at the top of their game, he can record his fifth career victory. The gelding looked unlucky when unseating two-out at Ludlow two runs ago and should not be judged harshly for his nine-length defeat by Bronson F'Sure (winner since) last time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
