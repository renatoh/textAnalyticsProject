One early critic described the experience as \u201canxiety\u201d. Not just black and white \u2026 Riley arrived at what would become her defining modus operandi in stages, and at a time of personal crisis with a relationship breakdown. She had tried a brushy, expressive black monochrome painting, but found it lifeless. Then, in 1961, came Kiss, two black forms that nearly touch against a white background.
