An internal IFA report seen by The Observer has concluded that the never-on-a-Sunday policy is probably sectarian and discriminatory towards some religions. Only evangelical Protestants support the continuation of the ban. The ban is unique to Northern Ireland; no other member of Uefa, European football's governing body, bars games on the sabbath. Last night the IFA's chief executive, Howard Wells, accepted that the ban, which he opposes, is in all likelihood a breach of the association's rules outlawing sectarianism in the sport. He also revealed that a fresh attempt will be made in October to overturn the 60-year-old ban. The report, part of the IFA's strategy for football in Northern Ireland, is dated April this year but has not yet been made public. Among its recommendations is a proposal to lift the Sunday ban. Its authors warn that it contradicts the IFA's policy to 'give sectarianism the boot' . A number of senior Irish League clubs and individuals connected to local leagues have threatened legal action, including the use of the Human Rights Act, to have the ban repealed. Asked if the report reflected the IFA's current thinking on the Sunday ban, Wells said: 'We have signed up to an equality policy that treats all parts of the Northern Ireland community equally and this must extend to allowing people the freedom to play on Sunday. The reality is that there are different communities arriving all the time into Northern Ireland. There are a lot of different religions here now.' He said that an extraordinary annual general meeting scheduled for October would discuss dumping the ban. 'We don't want to force people to do things that are against their beliefs or cultures, but we have to provide a freedom of choice for those that want to play on Sunday,' he said. However, the Free Presbyterian Church warned that it would use its influence in the Northern Ireland Assembly to thwart such a move. First Minister Ian Paisley founded the church, which still exercises considerable authority over his Democratic Unionists, the largest party at Stormont. Many of the DUP's MLAs are members of the Free Presbyterian Church and active supporters of organisations such as the Lord's Day Observance Society. The Rev David McIlveen, the church's moderator, denied that the ban was sectarian or racist. He pointed out that many Christians from Africa now living in Northern Ireland were in favour of keeping Sunday 'special and sacred'. He said: 'We feel that a number of Christian sportsmen would be discriminated against. This would in general be a backward step for sport.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
