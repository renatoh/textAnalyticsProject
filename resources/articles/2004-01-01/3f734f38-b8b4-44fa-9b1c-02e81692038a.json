Among the stipulations of the FA's suspension, United will be forbidden from going through with plans to invite a number of local clubs for games with the specific intention of keeping Ferdinand fit. He will be allowed to train with his team-mates but cannot play in any game, whether competitive or not, when it is \"11-a-side with match officials\". A similar clause was inserted in the small print of Eric Cantona's eight-month suspension in 1995 and the FA's hierarchy at the time threatened United with sanctions after it emerged they had arranged friendlies with Rochdale and Oldham, a turn of events that led to the Frenchman threatening to quit for good. Ferdinand is also facing another delay in an already protracted saga because of the vast amount of paperwork that goes with such a complex case. After considering the FA's 37 pages of findings, Ferdinand's legal team have produced a 125-page document of their own. It arrived at Soho Square at 4pm yesterday, only an hour before the deadline at which an appeal would have been automatically ruled out. The FA's lawyers will spend the next three weeks wading through the legal arguments before, under their own regulations, they have to submit an official reply, but officials at Soho Square, among them the chief executive Mark Palios, were said to be taken aback by the sheer volume of United's response. Another critical factor is that, as well as appealing against his suspension, Ferdinand intends to fight his conviction on a charge of misconduct. Had he just been hoping to get his sentence reduced, the FA would have simply reconsidered the evidence from the two-day hearing at Bolton in December and decided whether the punishment should be amended. Now, though, another hearing will have to be arranged for the player to give evidence, along with his character witnesses, UK Sport's drugs testers and everybody else who was involved, indirectly or not, when he failed to give a urine sample at United's training ground on September 23 last year. The FA's next step will be to appoint a new three-man commission, chaired by a QC, and a convenient date will have to be set when everyone can attend. Whereas Sir Alex Ferguson had said on Friday the hearing could be held within \"the next 10 days or so\", FA sources have indicated that more realistically it will be the last week of February at the earliest. Ferdinand might have struggled to make Sunday's FA Cup tie at Northampton anyway after suffering a knee injury during the surprise 1-0 defeat at Wolves at the weekend. If the \u00a330m England defender does not succeed in getting his sentence reduced, he will miss the rest of the season, the European Championship finals in Portugal and the first six weeks of next season. The Champions League will resume - United play Porto home and away at the end of February and early in March - before his case is even heard. It took three months before the FA heard the original case, much to Sven-Goran Eriksson's concern. \"It is far too long,\" the England manager said. \"It is the system that is wrong but I think it will be changed now. It is no good for the game. It is no good for the player.\" \"In Italy punishments are dealt with swiftly. If a player gets a red card he is sentenced on the Tuesday. If he requests a personal hearing it's dealt with on the Thursday.\" But he acknowledged that United played a part in the delay. \"Of course,\" he said, \"it is in Manchester United's interests to keep it going until Wes Brown is fit.\" Ferdinand and United have also been criticised for the way in which they have conducted their case. And it has been reported that there were clear inconsistencies in his evidence. Gordon Taylor, the Professional Footballers Association's chief executive, has expressed his concern that the United defender will not be able to receive an objective hearing because of the weight and balance of publicity his case has already attracted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
