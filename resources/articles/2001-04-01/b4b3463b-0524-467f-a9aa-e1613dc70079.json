This time round Rovers will indubitably finish the higher but what is increasingly likely is that they will take the second automatic promotion slot behind Fulham as well. Saturday's victory put clear daylight between Graeme Souness's men and third-placed Bolton Wanderers, and as the manager said: \"We are in a wonderful position because our destiny is in our hands. \"We're not going to win all the games but neither are the teams who are challenging us: we'll be punched on the nose and it's how we're going to deal with those punches when they come. To date when that's happened to us we've bounced back and shown great character and if we're going to get out of this league we're going to have to keep that kind of attitude.\" Character is not a word that has been much used in conjunction with Blackburn since their championship win in 1995 but that is one commodity Souness does not lack. In just over a year in charge the tough Scot has managed to succeed where Ray Harford, Roy Hodgson and Brian Kidd have failed before him and instil plenty of character into his team. So much so that when they fell behind to an early QPR goal they never faltered, rolling their sleeves up and grinding out a good result. Rovers were unflustered after Chris Plummer's header from a corner had surprisingly put the home side ahead and David Dunn's scrambled shot soon restored parity. When Matt Jansen fired Rovers ahead on the stroke of half-time the game was up for QPR and Eyal Berkovic's late strike was no more than they deserved. \"It wasn't a classic but given that Birmingham lost and Bolton didn't play it was a good afternoon for us,\" said Souness. For poor old QPR, on the other hand, only heartbreak awaits. Under the less than inspiring management of Ian Holloway they have lost five, drawn two and are eight points adrift of safety with just six games remaining. Worse, their parent company, Loftus Road plc, is losing \u00a3570,000 a month and they were put into administration last week along with their sister club Wasps by Chris Wright, who then did some adroit wheeler dealing and bought the rugby operation back. The football club and the ground still await a new owner, though Wright will underwrite their costs until October. Relegation would be a hammer blow. They would lose out on more than \u00a32m of television money, their gate receipts would be reduced and they have 22 players coming out of contract this summer who can leave on free transfers. And to think they were in the Premiership just five years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
