As Leeds prepare for two pivotal games against the Belgian champions in the space of eight days, O'Leary and his chairman Peter Ridsdale have been dismayed to learn of G\u00e9rard Houllier's intentions. It is well known that the Liverpool manager is looking for a new goalkeeper after a number of dubious displays by Sander Westerveld this season and although Martyn signed a four-year contract last summer, the emergence of Paul Robinson means he can no longer be guaranteed a first-team place at Leeds. Ideally, O'Leary would like to keep both the 33-year-old England international and his 21-year-old understudy but there is also a feeling in the Leeds camp that Martyn should not be perceived as indispensable. Leeds understand that Martyn heads a Liverpool shortlist that also includes Coventry's Chris Kirkland. It is a subplot Leeds could do without as they size up an Anderlecht side whose success in reaching this stage has been unexpected as their own. After the first three games of the opening phase the Belgians were bottom of their group but squeaked into the second stage after beating Manchester United 2-1 in Brussels. So far in Group D they have been soundly beaten 4-1 by Real Madrid but a 1-0 win at home to Sven-Goran Eriksson's Lazio put them level with Leeds on three . O'Leary will have to fare without Robbie Keane who is cup-tied, having played for Internazionale. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
