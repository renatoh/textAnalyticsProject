He has a son with Beki Blackman, from whom he is now divorced. He is currently single. Beki believed in me too much. She gave me every chance: to start my own business, pay off the debts, cut down on the drinking. She should have stood her ground more. She really did stay until the bitter end, until there was nothing left. I liked Beki's honesty, her openness and the fact that she was worldly-wise. There was a chemistry at first sight, and that quickly developed into love. You always know when you've found the love of your life. Graphic design was seen as a trendy career with amazing prospects, and I think we thought our future was assured, so we might as well spend and live well. Life looked golden, and the credit cards were there to be used. We lived in London for two-and-a-half years, and had fun. However, the job I had, as principal designer for a company, was very frustrating. I was working long hours, making the firm a lot of money, none of which I saw. My boss had a Ferrari, and I couldn't afford to run a Fiesta. It all seemed wrong. Beki was fed up with being in a similar situation, so one Friday afternoon I resigned. We moved to Bristol. We both felt a slower pace of life would be good for us and our relationship. Things were good to begin with but, after a few years of partying, we had no time for ourselves. People had come to depend on our flat as both a social space and a place to talk about their problems. We were always welcoming, but it seemed there wasn't much reciprocal support from other people. Our debts never worried me as much as they did Beki, and that put a tremendous strain on us as a couple. I tended to live for the day; she would be worrying about paying the rent for the next month. I like the nice things in life - Beki is more realistic. Every now and then, the debts would be lassoed in and then they'd creep up again. I have had a long and, sadly, fond relationship with alcohol. It allowed me to bury my worries about money, work, relationships. It's a mental cosh, but an illusory one. My dependence crept up on me. All of our money ended up funding our excessively sociable lifestyle. I was overjoyed when Beki got pregnant, but at the back of my thoughts was the fact that we had all these money worries. I started working longer hours. There was a huge drinking culture in my workplace, which didn't help. Every lunch hour was spent in the pub, all work meetings took place there and we'd drink after work. Beki had no close family to rely on once the baby came, so she felt very isolated. To be honest, I continued my lifestyle very much in the same vein as it had been before our son was born. If I could go back in time, I'd have left my job five years before I did. Beki told me to and I didn't listen. I am sure that our relationship was salvageable at that point. I was wrapped up in the lifestyle, the status I had in the company. Those things mean nothing to me now. I didn't think enough about Beki's needs. She appeared to our friends to be happy but inside she was getting sadder as I let her down again and again. She felt abandoned by me, and she was right. I wasn't shocked when she asked for a divorce, but I had a huge number of regrets. Beki is still my best friend and I can't imagine anyone else I'd rather have as the mother to my child. I'm not interested in looking for a partner at the moment. I'm applying for jobs in her local area because I want to be close to her and our son. Her story Beki Blackman is 41 and currently single. She has two sons and lives on the north Cornwall coast. She is an artist and works part-time as a waitress. She and Richard Comer were together for 14 years. Being with Richard taught me never to use a man as an excuse not to follow your dreams. I should have pursued my art as well as supporting him. Before I knew it, 10 years had gone by and I had lost myself. I don't think Richard respected me because I was compromising myself. We met at a party when I was 21. I was a graphic-design student, Richard was a designer. There was an immediate attraction. He said he'd give me a lift home and turned up at the door with a nice leather jacket and helmet. I thought he had some big motorbike. We walked down a few streets and there it was - this tiny, crappy 50cc moped. That's Richard: the impression and the reality are two very different things. There were always money issues. I should have heeded the warnings but was naive. I was waitressing, while Rich was getting well paid, but he borrowed money from me to go on holiday. Once I graduated, we got jobs in London and moved in together. We were on \u00a320k each and living the good life. It was brilliant, but the pressure started to mount. We had deadlines and sometimes had to be in the office until midnight. My friends in Bristol seemed to be having fun so we decided to leave our jobs and head south. In Bristol I had a series of retail jobs, while Richard got an executive position in a mail-order company. He promised that when our debts were paid off he would support me and allow me to do my art full-time. We were earning good money and spending it: drinking every night, eating out, just about paying the bills. There was no intimacy. If we went out for a romantic meal, Rich's phone would ring and six others would join us. I would get up in the morning, find 10 sleeping bodies in the living room, bottles on the floor, no food in the fridge. I got broody when I hit 30, but Rich said he wouldn't have kids until we were married. I agreed because I wanted a child. Three years later I had our son. In the meantime, Richard had attempted to start up a couple of businesses. The ideas were good but they got us further into debt. Richard would borrow money and then drink it away and the business would fail. He was happy to use other people's cash to fund the businesses, but when I asked him for \u00a350 for art materials, he refused. I found out he'd borrowed money from friends and banks and hadn't told me. Bailiffs came round and I got Rich to admit we owed \u00a38,000. I would meet him in the pub on a Friday lunchtime and take his wages off him to pay the rent. I said we needed to move and Rich needed to find a different job, with less hours. I rearranged our finances so we could get a mortgage on a house in Taunton. But Richard did nothing. He drank every night in Bristol and came back to our house at the weekends, while I was stuck on my own with a new baby. We were in the house four months when things fell apart. Richard got behind on the mortgage repayments. When I told him I wanted a divorce and to get back into work, he opened the paper and put a ring around cleaning jobs. That's all he thought I was capable of. I moved to Cornwall and stayed with friends. It was an amicable divorce, but I was so miserable, I wanted to die. I don't regret having been with Rich, but I regret taking so long to end it. There is potential inside Rich, if he can tap into it. There was a bloke I loved once who was full of good things, and he's still in there somewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
