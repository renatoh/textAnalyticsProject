This loss raised doubts as to whether they are equipped with the toughness of mind necessary to get to the pinnacle and stay there. The flaws were seen everywhere. They were drab when the onus was on them to take command, still passive as Everton snatched a second goal and absurd when Kolo Tour\u00e9 was sent off for two cautionable offences in quick succession at the very end. City will complain about penalty appeals rejected by the referee, Peter Walton, but in each case there was a question as to whether there had been rashness or intent in the handball. Everton had pulled off a feat that must be admired all the more because they had arrived without a victory in seven games and also had to withstand the dismissal of their forward Victor Anichebe in the second half. So far as City are concerned, this outcome should make them worry about their sparse scoring rate at home. Carlos Tevez could do almost nothing to enhance it on an occasion that was intended to speak of a renewal in his relationship with the club. He had withdrawn his transfer request and, in the spirit of concord, been allowed to retain the captaincy. It is not all that uncommon for any striker to end a match without a goal, but there must have been a yearning to see Tevez confirm by his deeds that City is where he sees his future. However, the principal difficulty with the Argentinian is that they cannot afford to see him have a humdrum match. No other striker on the books has either the hunger or the technique to score repeatedly. It was an apt assessment of their condition that the City goal was accidentally put into his own net by a blameless Phil Jagielka in the 72nd minute. The passing by David Silva and the substitute Adam Johnson had been convincing then, but the drive from Yaya Tour\u00e9 still needed the assistance of that ricochet off the centre-back. With 13 minutes to go, City almost levelled even though parity was more than they deserved. After Mario Balotelli hit a post, Howard beat him to the loose ball and then got himself in the path of a Tevez drive. The Argentinian caught the eye then and he can legitimately argue that his team-mates caused too little mayhem. It may have been an indifferent showing by Tevez but little was done to bring out the best in him. City could not get over the shock of the boldness Everton brought with them to Eastlands. The goals scored so early in the night left City bemused as well as wounded. Apart from considering the harm inflicted they must have been incapable of understanding how little they had done to interrupt the visitors. After four minutes, a delivery from the left by Leighton Baines went deep to Seamus Coleman and he turned it into the centre for Cahill to score with a header. City might have fatalistic about the circumstances of the second goal in the 19th minute. They were down to 10 men since the right-back Pablo Zabaleta was off the field so that a cut to his head could be bandaged. Nonetheless, Everton's move was of such fluency that it would be churlish to insist that the goal had come through weight of numbers alone. Baines made ground on the left and his delivery was laid off by Anichebe to Cahill, with the midfielder setting up Baines to complete the move he started by bending a finish into the far post with his right foot. It had been so exquisite a piece of play that it looked as if it were Everton rather than City who possessed limitless riches. Some in the home ranks would have started to recall a pair of defeats to David Moyes's team in the league last season. Indeed this was a fourth successive Everton victory here. They might have been thinking, too, about their own bluntness in attack, with just eight league goals scored at home before this match. Everton, however, had been in difficulties of late and that was reflected in the fact that Moyes preferred Anichebe despite the fact that the striker has rejected a new contract offer and was booed when he came on in the goalless draw with Wigan. Anichebe's rehabilitation had made great progress by half-time, but he was to prove reckless even if Walton was draconian. Having been booked for impeding Joe Hart in the 55th minute Anichebe still made a needless challenge on Zabaleta and was dismissed. Nothing, all the same, will dampen Everton's joy. For City, the frustration and doubt about the progress of their enterprise will wash over them once more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
