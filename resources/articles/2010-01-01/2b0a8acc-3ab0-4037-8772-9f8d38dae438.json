Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments, a study in contrasting wind sounds that deliberately avoids pathos, sat uneasily alongside lusher and longer works by Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov. Dutoit's programming of the Symphonies was admirable and a vote of confidence in his excellent wind sections, but he was better rewarded in Rimsky's Scheherazade than in the Symphonies, which felt under-rehearsed. Vadim Repin's account of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto was idiosyncratic, and it seemed as if soloist and orchestra only began to work for each other late in the work. Repin began nonchalantly, almost scrappily, but his big, open Russian tone was wonderfully authentic, and the performance went up a gear in the dizzying first-movement cadenza. Repin's account of the andante was unusually broad and spare, and the finale was anything but ethereal. Everything came together best, however, in a hugely effective performance of Scheherazade. The opening seascape depicting Sinbad's voyages had a compelling rhythmic momentum that Rachmaninov must have had in his head when he wrote The Isle of the Dead some 20 years later. The RPO strings produced real excitement in the quicker second movement, and Clio Gould played Scheherazade's theme with ever-changing character throughout. The finale was edge-of-the-seat stuff. Dutoit sometimes seems to be going through the motions, but when he is engaged and demanding of his players, as he was here from start to finish, the results are of the highest class."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
