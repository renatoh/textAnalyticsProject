There was little of the swashbuckling style in which the Spaniard so delights in evidence in south London, but a timely win has provided his team with a platform going into Saturday\u2019s derby. \u201cWe will hopefully play a different game [then] to today,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, suggesting this slog still felt unnatural. Everton scored early through Romelu Lukaku\u2019s 10th goal of the season, the Belgian bundling in Juli\u00e1n Speroni\u2019s weak push from close range, and clung on while Crystal Palace frantically pursued an equaliser. When that pressure petered out the poise was all Evertonian and there should have been greater rewards on the counterattack late on. Muhamed Besic and Gareth Barry were excellent in niggling, destructive roles in front of the backline, while John Stones was composed and impressive. This side will be ready for their city rivals. Lukaku\u2019s finish was instinctive, anticipating the goalkeeper\u2019s parry of Steven Naismith\u2019s low cross, and although his first touch remains erratic his aggression in the channels still marks him out as a wrecker of defenders\u2019 reputations. He has drawn criticism at times but he has a goal more than at this stage last season, when he was a Chelsea loanee at Goodison Park. \u201cHe is a joy to work with,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. \u201cHe has never shied away from the responsibility. \u201cHe wanted to be there, to put himself in the spotlight. I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves. But he is a young man and once people see what he can do consistently they will get excited. You\u2019d be surprised how he has been getting stronger and better in every game. Now he has reached the physical level where he plays his best: all power and pace. But we are all part of a team and if the team doesn\u2019t get the results when you face adversity you learn a lot more from each individual. The reality is that this squad is ready to try and kick on again.\u201d Liverpool will test that conviction, but Everton will be better placed to unnerve them with James McCarthy nearing a return after persistent hamstring trouble and Ross Barkley given a rest among the substitutes. Palace will have to demonstrate they, too, can recover after suffering the first setback of Alan Pardew\u2019s brief tenure. This was a strangely spluttering display, wrecked by Marouane Chamakh\u2019s departure with a broken nose and a lack of guile and subtlety thereafter. Jordon Mutch appeared a little lost on debut, and Yaya Sanogo too isolated on his first appearance at Selhurst Park. The manager has options with four arrivals in the transfer window to date \u2013 Pape Souar\u00e9 will join his team-mates on Tuesday after his \u00a33.45m signing from Lille, while Shola Ameobi works on his fitness \u2013 and Pardew will monitor the market on deadline day. The priority is at the back with his team too often left playing catch-up. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep falling behind and giving teams a head start,\u201d said Scott Dann. \u201cMore often than not you can\u2019t get back in the game and that showed here. We need to make sure we stop conceding early goals.\u201d Man of the match Gareth Barry (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
