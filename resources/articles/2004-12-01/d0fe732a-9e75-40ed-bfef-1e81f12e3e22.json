Adults who, rather than grappling with the niceties of the grown-up world - Pinot Noir, harmless flirting, growing shallots - have opted for the safety of the toy room. Plastic soldiers, train sets, balsawood boats. They are the large men who tackle life with the help of a magnifying glass and a small screwdriver. The fiddlier the better. The one area of the model-making universe I've always felt wistful about is remote-control cars. As a youngster I never got my hands on one; they were too expensive. And when, as an adult, I could afford one I couldn't be bothered with building one. But now, even dedicated hobbyists have accepted there's a market in toys for boys who can't wait. And so the advent of RTR - 'Ready to Run' - remote-control cars which can be unboxed and driven in less time than it takes Nicholas Soames to eat a cream bun. The remote-control car scene takes in everything from 60mph racing cars to obsessively accurate scaled-down rally cars, but the most exciting are the off-roaders. These are the ankle-height vehicles you've probably seen careening around your local park scaring dogs and denting Zimmer frames. The undisputed big daddy of off-roaders is the Savage 25, a 1/8th scale miniaturised monster truck - the most powerful RTR kit ever. The four-wheel drive minibeast has a 2.5bhp 4.1cc nitro engine, 7in shock absorbers, a rigid aluminium chassis, disc brakes, two gears and four multi-studded rubber wheels that wouldn't look out of place in an Ann Summers catalogue. The Savage is capable of doing 40mph, which when scaled-up means a top speed of more than 300mph. To finally satiate my childhood desires, I went to a muddy swamp in darkest Surrey. Dan Foulds, who owns the MaxBashing circuit and edits a magazine of the same name, explained to me that the course got its name because 'it was a place you could give your RC off-roader a maximum bashing'. Before I was let loose, however, a stuntman put the miniature monster through its paces. Barrel rolls, 15ft leaps, dirt spins... so precise was his handling that I began to think that the Savage wasn't a remote-controlled vehicle, after all and that there was actually a trained stunt rat at the wheel. My go next. The old toggle handsets have been replaced by a sort of handgun-shaped controller. The throttle is where the trigger should be and the steering is via a wheel mounted on the barrel of the gun. It takes a while to get used to the Savage's astonishing acceleration. And anyone who has trouble with their lefts and rights will struggle to keep the Savage out of the undergrowth. Or in my case a small river. Mercifully, the Savage seems indestructible, no matter how much abuse you throw at it, and soon I was doing 20ft leaps, big-air jumps, back somersaults and dirt-spewing end-over-end crashes. It was, as we modellers like to say, 'Bashing to the max.' \u00b7 The HPI Savage 25 costs \u00a3475 and is available from good toy stores"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
