Ings had a goal disallowed and rattled a post here before netting his 20th league goal of the season to earn Southampton a draw, becoming the first Southampton player to reach that landmark since James Beattie in 2003 and keeping alive his chances of winning the Golden Boot. For Brighton, who took the lead through Neal Maupay, this point all but guarantees their top-flight status for another season. Ings finished clinically midway through the second half but both teams could have snatched victory through unlikely sources, Yves Bissouma blasting wide after Mat Ryan made a fingertip save to prevent Jannik Vestergaard\u2019s piledriver from finding the top corner. As Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl acknowledged, Southampton were regrettably sluggish out of the blocks but returned reinvigorated after the introduction of Ch\u00e9 Adams and Kyle Walker-Peters at the interval. \u201cDisaster first half, very good second half,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cIn the end I think we made the right changes at half-time. You don\u2019t deserve more when you start like this, we were a little bit slow in our minds.\u201d Whereas Brighton appeared reinvigorated after making six changes, Southampton\u2019s introduction of five new faces led to a disjointed and muddled first-half display, which Maupay seized on. Glenn Murray cutely flicked on Tariq Lamptey\u2019s long throw and Maupay punished some slack Southampton defending, darting between Vestergaard and Jan Bednarek to fire home. It was a sharp finish, his 10th goal of the season, a milestone that puts him in good company, becoming the sixth French player to reach that tally in his debut season in the Premier League, following in the footsteps of Eric Cantona and Thierry Henry. Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg, who was stripped of the captaincy last month and is the subject of interest from Everton and Tottenham, reverted to midfield after an awkward first half at right-back and Southampton slowly asserted their authority, with Jake Vokins striking narrowly wide on his Premier League debut. Lewis Dunk made a miraculous goal-saving block to stop Adams smacking in a rebound after an Ings shot rattled the woodwork, and Brighton were guilty of retreating deeper and inviting a swell of Southampton pressure, which eventually told when Ings bared his teeth. \u201cIt would have been a bit unjust if we had nicked the win,\u201d said Graham Potter, the Brighton manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
