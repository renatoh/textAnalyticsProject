Ronnie Gordon smiles back, like he does \u2212 part cheeky, part honeydew. \"About two in the morning, if you're lucky,\" he purrs in his broad pre-Rasta Kingston accent, adjusting his pork-pie hat \u2013 not one of those trilby imitations, but the authentic round kind. Then he heads up the ramp to be manoeuvred into the waiting Dial-a-Ride cab while net curtains twitch at the windows overlooking the forecourt. Ronnie Gordon is one of the last \u2013 if not the last \u2013 of the great voices singing in Britain after crossing the Atlantic between the Caribbean and the imperial mother country as part of the \"Windrush generation\". Named after the ship that disembarked the first Jamaicans on to the quays at Tilbury docks in 1948, the migrants arrived as fodder for a racist post-colonial enterprise enabling Britain to pay rock-bottom wages to black citizens of the crumbled empire for menial work to which white Britons considered themselves ill-suited. What the West Indians brought as well were the seeds of an effervescent culture that became transatlantic: Jamaican jazz, ska and, later, reggae music. Tributes and cover versions are ubiquitous, but there are not many cellars where you can hear the originals sing the real thing. Except, that is, where Ronnie is heading tonight: a local pub where the canal cuts beneath St Pancras Way. \"The Constitution, please, Mr Driver,\" says Ronnie as the cabbie secures the wheelchair. From the moment he stood up to sing at a lunchtime session at the Finsbury Park Hotel in north London, soon after he arrived in England in 1957, Ronnie Gordon became part of that history. Now, aged 75, he is releasing his first album, Ronnie Gordon Speaks His Mind \u2212 backed by some of the best soul, ska and reggae musicians living in Britain. It's a unique and unprecedented event: the original song-man from Jamaica, surrounded by musicians who have all left their mark on Britain's reggae, soul and jazz scenes down the decades \u2013 as are the gigs he's playing at the Constitution. At first it was just Ronnie, Mick Eve and Ronnie's cousin Winston Lewis on guitar playing to a handful of people. Then, as word of mouth kicked in, other top-class musicians began to join in and the audience started to grow. These are all highly talented musicians at the top of their game who return from wherever they are to be here tonight. Winston Delandro, formerly of Gonzalez, has worked with the likes of Johnny Nash, Jimmy Ruffin and Eric Clapton, and now travels the world with Ali Campbell's post-UB40 band. Mick Eve has been touring lately with Boney M \u2013 but his musical heart is back here in the cellar towards which Ronnie's taxi rides. \"I was born in Kingston, in what is now a bad part of town,\" recalls Ronnie as we pass through the lights of Mile End Road. \"There was poverty and there were some bad people, but not guns and knives like these days. People lived well in that country.\" The music, Ronnie explains, \"was big bands at first, and there was swing music, Duke Ellington music. I'd go and listen to it in Jubilee Gardens around the time when I got my first pair of long trousers, at 15 or something. Then the music changed \u2013 to smaller bands and solo singers, and American R&amp;B. There were talent competitions in cinemas and I used to enter \u2013 and that's how I met Laurel Aitken.\" Aitken is regarded as the founder of ska, among the first artists to be recorded by Chris Blackwell, and the first reggae success in Britain. An older cousin, Pearlita, who had elected to sail to England, \"wanted to pay my fare,\" says Ronnie, \"so that someone would accompany her. At first I didn't pay her much regard \u2013 I wanted to go to America. But we boarded a ship called the Irpinia, spent five hours in Santo Domingo, and after a while we landed in Southampton.\" Ronnie celebrated his 20th birthday during the voyage. \"When I came here to England, I didn't feel cut off from the music back home because I was living in Tottenham, and the music was all around me.\" We park up outside the Royal Fish Bar and Kebab House by the ramp on to the Regent's canal, near Camden Road. \"We pay for the taxi with whatever we get in the hat later on,\" says Ronnie. We arrive at a door giving on to the canal. There's a rattle of metal and the door lifts to reveal a cosy subterranean space lit by blue fairy lights that shine on the face of a lanky man, also in his mid-70s, wearing a sort-of goatee beard and a broad smile: sax player Mick Eve, welcoming the singer he has played with for more than half a century. \"They're here,\" Mick says, indicating a group of musicians coming down the narrow stairs from a door at street level, carrying guitar and other instrument cases \u2013 \"looking like bandits from Al Capone, as usual.\" Mick and Ronnie first met at the Finsbury Park Hotel in 1961. Mick served in the RAF, stationed in Hertfordshire; he was among those young white men drop-jawed at the new sounds arriving in England from America and the Caribbean, to be heard in clubs like El Rio in Notting Hill. \"I had a Trinidadian girlfriend at the time, which helped,\" he informs me. Among Mick's early partners playing gigs around the bases were John McLaughlin, who later formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra and paired up with Carlos Santana, and Brian Auger who, with his band the Trinity, famously teamed up with Julie Driscoll to record a hit version of Bob Dylan's \"This Wheel's on Fire\". During national service, Mick supplemented his \u00a32-a-week pay by getting the train back to London at weekends for jazz sessions at the Finsbury Park Hotel. At the Sunday-lunchtime sessions, recalls Ronnie Gordon, \"people would get up and pitch all sorts of songs\". And one day, in late 1957, \"I just asked: 'Can I sing a song? I'm Jamaican.' And Mick has never excluded me since.\" Ronnie had been living on the Seven Sisters Road, sharing a room with a Jamaican family who made room for him and a cousin by taking the mattress off their bed. \"We shared a cooler in the hallway with all the other people in the house,\" recalls Ronnie. He worked in many places, including for Ford at Dagenham, before joining the Post Office at Mount Pleasant, where he remained until retirement. But Ronnie and Mick's life soon focused on the Flamingo Club in Wardour Street, where Mick played a residence with Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Britain's foremost white soul touring band in the day, with whom Ronnie also \"sat in\" to sing. \"It was a place where you might want to dress up a bit for the weekend,\" says Mick. \"It was lovely there,\" recalls Ronnie. \"They used to play straight jazz, but then it changed when the all-nighters started.\" Ronnie cut a single with the Blue Flames, then joined Red Bludd's Bluesicians after they had advertised in Melody Maker for a singer. The band included \"a white gentleman on keyboard, name of Jon Lord\". Was that the Jon Lord who formed Deep Purple? \"Yes, I think that was it \u2013 Deep Purple, yes \u2013 a very nice young man, and so good on the piano.\" Talking to Mick Eve about those days is like being handed an encyclopedia of that scene written with his inimitably droll sense of humour. \"I was mooching around in Denmark Street one day and there's this racket coming out of a guitar shop, and Chas Chandler comes running out saying: 'Mick! Come in and listen to this fella I met in New York, Jimi Hendrix is his name.' I said: 'I don't need to go into the shop, Chas, I can hear him from here.'\" And: \"I remember when the Stones came down to the Flamingo for the first time \u2013 the hookers all crowding around Brian Jones.\" In the late 60s Mick had \"run away to live in Europe\", returning to join, in 1970, the great R&amp;B and funk-fusion band Gonzalez, which toured and recorded up to 1986. Ronnie's life, however, went in a different direction for a while. Neither Mick nor Ronnie want to talk much about \"the sort-of-interval\" of Ronnie's marriage, except to explain how, says Mick, \"she wouldn't allow us through the door\". Ronnie stopped singing publicly for three decades, but continued to write songs in his head and \u2013 his divorce impending \u2013 \"had a few comebacks\u2026 like Frank Sinatra!\" In 2001 he retired from the Post Office, bought himself a keyboard, took lessons and reconvened with Mick to play pub sets \"for a roast and a few pennies\". Then Tamara Edwards, the woman who organised the restaurant sessions, booked Ronnie and Mick to provide music \"suitable for the over-21s\" at her nephew's 21st birthday party at the Constitution. The landlady of the pub, Wendy Clare, was smitten by what she heard from the two seventy-somethings: \"They were just perfect,\" she says. \"I wanted to put them on for free.\" The musicians' warm-up warms the night air and empty bar. Mick Eve and the Trinidadian guitarist Winston Delandro help Ronnie, who's recovering from a hip operation, to move his wheelchair to the front of the stage. The cellar fills to create a shebeen atmosphere: Mick's playing is polished, Winston picks the beat \u2013 often circumnavigating, but never losing it \u2013 with the odd dazzling flurry on the fretboard while Ronnie sings. \"We'd like to do a little number I wrote 50 years ago,\" he says, introducing his single \"Shake Some Time\". Once the ska starts up, time dissipates \u2013 as do London's social straitjackets. The audience, dancing, jivin' and foot-tappin', is a 50/50 mix of black and white, aged 20 to 70. Maybe that's just the alchemy of ska and its irresistible beat. They strike up Laurel Aitken's classic song \"Gimme Back Me Pork Pie Hat\". And there's Dandy Livingstone's \"A Message to You, Rudy\". The gig is over and the cellar has emptied out. \"I'll see you in my dreams,\" sings Wendy to Ronnie as we head out to the taxi. Ronnie closes his eyes, but he is thinking \u2013 not sleeping. \"When you get a big crowd like that, you want to give it a little bit more,\" he says. It is approaching 2am when the cab pulls up at Hibiscus Lodge. And he says: \"It was fun in the 60s, but it's even better now. I could be alone, sitting in a room with the TV, and instead I get to play with the most beautiful musicians I ever met. So I am blessed, even if I don't always remember all the words.\" Ronnie Gordon Speaks His Mind is released later this month on Barefoot Label (barefootlabel.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
