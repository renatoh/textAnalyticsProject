The Wanderers manager gave a plausible explanation for the substitution that riled visiting fans late on but there was no attempt to provide any excuses for his players after another insipid showing. Bolton are in free fall, this performance the type that gets managers the sack. That would be the knee-jerk reaction to their current predicament but Lee, who admitted he was unable to find a single positive here, is not alone in hoping the Bolton board show understanding. Mindful of the job Lee has inherited, Steve Bruce urged Bolton to act with restraint. \"Let me tell you, it would be difficult for any manager to replace Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or Alex Ferguson given the standards they have achieved,\" said Birmingham's manager. \"Now the same is going to be true of Little Sammy to replace Big Sam [Allardyce] at Bolton. \"If you look at any successful club, and Bolton are one, they've got continuity. There's going to be bad times - there have been low times for me in my six years at Birmingham, but today we're sitting 12th. The club has stood by me and I've repaid them by being loyal. The one thing Sammy's got to have now is time.\" Lee is likely to appreciate those sentiments although a vote of confidence from his players would be more welcome. This was not the occasion. Nicolas Anelka might be the Premier League's leading scorer but here he was anonymous before he sprang to life at the final whistle, leaving the pitch quicker than anyone else. Birmingham, obdurate and hard-working, exposed Bolton's fragility, with Olivier Kapo stabbing the enterprising Sebastian Larsson's cross over the line in the 37th minute. Bolton were listless in response, the only chance for the away fans to find their voice coming when Lee withdrew Andy O'Brien for Gerald Cid, leaving Kevin Davies on the bench. Bolton's manager later revealed that O'Brien, suffering from cramp, could not play on. The pain may be more prolonged for the rest of Bolton's squad unless Lee can find a remedy for their worst start to a Premier League season. The manager views Thursday's Uefa Cup tie in Macedonia against Rabotnicki Kometal as \"another opportunity to try and get our season going\", before fixtures against Tottenham at home three days later and Derby away the following Saturday. Chelsea and Arsenal are next. \"I understand the pressure that comes with football,\" said Lee. \"But although I'm new to the manager's job, I'm not exactly new to football. We are in a difficult position but I wouldn't like to use the words survival or crisis.\" Man of the match Sebastian Larsson (Birmingham City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
