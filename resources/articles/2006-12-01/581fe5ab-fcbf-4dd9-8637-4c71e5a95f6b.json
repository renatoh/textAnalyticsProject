We pick it up half-way through. India: \"I do not slag off working-class people in crop tops, you fucking loon. Where? When? Why would I slag them off? I am many things, but I am not a snob. You're driving me mad.\" Julie: \"I wrote to the letters page, not you, you stalking cretin. Why don't you fuck off and turn yet another of your husbands gay?\" Meteoric rise Will Lewis rose from Sunday Times City editor to Telegraph City editor, then managing director (editorial), then Daily Telegraph editor with his own \"digital news hub\", all within 14 months. Which is not bad at all for a 37-year-old. Fall to earth Charles Allen could only defy gravity for so long. Plunging advertising revenues and audience figures finally forced him from the stage, although he delivered a defiant final bow in Edinburgh. Losing respect George Galloway thought he was feline groovy on Celebrity Big Brother.

Annus horribilis Tessa Jowell started the year by separating from husband David Mills and ended it by losing a battle with Gordon Brown over the BBC's licence fee. All this, and the bill for the 2012 Olympics is spiralling out of control. Odds are she won't be culture secretary this time next year. Highest score The World Cup attracted the most TV viewers this year: 18.5 million saw England against Sweden. Deal or No Deal NTL's merger approach to ITV had the City gripped. Then Sky called its bankers and suddenly it was game over. Launch of the year High definition television finally hit the high street this summer through Sky and NTL/Telewest, just in time for the football World Cup. Fans were over the moon... until they saw England play. Blunder of the year ITV forgetting to renew Paul O'Grady's contract for his hit show in January. He waltzed off to Channel 4 instead. Best website YouTube came of age and was swept off its feet by Google's $1.65bn takeover. Clips previously bound for You've Been Framed were \"monetised\" and renamed \"user-generated content\". Tabloid fodder Big-haired Russell Brand was the most written about man in Britain - thanks in large part to a talent for bedding women taht made David Walliams look demure. Turn on... Ruth Badger's sales technique and Syed Ahmed's romance with Michelle Dewberry made BBC2's The Apprentice compulsive viewing. No wonder the new series is transferring to BBC1. Tune out... Davina McCall's chatshow, Davina, had viewers cringing. Switch off... Mark Thompson had started well as BBC director general; then the licence fee decision went against him, and he lost friends by threatening to abandon a move to Manchester.
