It could, then, have been a stroke of good fortune for the Group of Eight nations to be meeting at the same time as a downward spiral of retaliation and counter-strike took hold in Israel and Lebanon. In a sane world the summit would have allowed the heads of the most powerful countries to sit down and jointly persuade all sides into respecting a ceasefire and imposing a period of calm. Instead, the G8 meeting in St Petersburg remained divided. Its emergency communique, issued last night after long wrangling, merely called for \"utmost restraint\" and an end to attacks, and for the UN security council to consider a monitoring force on the border between Israel and Lebanon. The G8's language, though, fell well short of a ceasefire, despite Jacques Chirac's optimism. For Israel, a ceasefire would mean respite from deadly rocket strikes, such as the one that struck a railway station in Haifa on Sunday, killing eight civilians. For Lebanon, it would have meant allowing its dysfunctional government to deal with the sudden population convulsions taking place as its citizens flee in panic at Israeli air attacks, and try to restrain the fanatics intent on provoking Israel further. For Palestinians, it would mean a pause for the desperate population corralled into Gaza. And for all parties it would have halted the escalation that threatens to draw in further involvement by Syria and Iran - a nightmare scenario. Without a clear ceasefire none of that can happen. But despite active support from France and Russia, the US was intent on blocking any such call. Tony Blair laid blame on Syria and Iran for supporting extremists. George Bush, pressed over whether he supported a ceasefire, instead reiterated: \"My message to Israel is that as a sovereign nation, you have every right to defend yourself against terrorist activities.\" Condoleezza Rice was forced to perform somersaults of logic to support her president's position by arguing a ceasefire that halted the violence would make matters worse. The time for calling for restraint has passed, since too many on both sides show no signs of exercising any. Sunday's deadly Hizbullah rocket attack on Haifa, in particular, elevates the conflict to a point where the danger cannot be overestimated. The most plaintive event yesterday, in the midst civilians of all faiths being killed, was the Lebanese prime minister, Fouad Siniora, appearing on CNN to plead for his country's future. Lebanon's government bears the signs of collapsing into a failed state. To expect it to successfully disarm Hizbullah's militants, while Israeli jets pound Tyre and Beirut as they did yesterday, inflicting collective punishment and undermining its fragile economy, is unrealistic. Last night there were reports of Italy acting as an interlocutor, the first positive sign of the weekend. Israel's leaders must be aware of the dangers they face. The road they are going down is one that Israel travelled before, and it ended in 1982 in disaster - hence the comments yesterday by Amir Peretz, Israel's defence minister, specifically ruling out a reoccupation of Lebanon. It is also worth remembering that the weekend's chaos began three weeks ago, with the provocative kidnapping of an Israeli soldier by allies of Hamas. Then, on Wednesday, Hizbullah captured two more. Their fate remains unknown. Israel's disproportionate response has now brought the area into chaos. It has acted as though the politics of the region do not exist; instead it has reacted directly to each kidnapping and each missile. Israel has the right to defend itself, a task made harder by the hidden arsenal of Hizbullah, and it should object to any one-sided calls for restraint. But it cannot control its enemies' responses: it can only control its own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
