Would Ellis take her late husband's clothes to make quilts for their three children, she asked, to give them something precious to remember him by? So Ellis sat down with the kids, aged 11, nine and eight, to talk about what their dad meant to them and how they had spent their time together. Armed with stories and piles of his clothes, she went away and sewed three quilts, delivered to the grieving family on what would have been their father's 52nd birthday. It's an emotional story, but one that reveals how a handmade quilt is more than a warm bedspread. It's a precious, deeply personal object, an heirloom and a teller of stories. Often filled with fabrics that have special meaning, from a cherished item of clothing to a hand-me-down tablecloth, quilts improve with age as fabrics soften and fade. Traditionally, they were a chance to sit with family and friends. Today, most of our downtime is spent online or in front of the TV. \"I like to think a quilt retains the spirit of the person who makes it,\" says Ellis, a New Zealand-born quiltmaker who has settled in London. \"The act of piecing together cloth, to make something both practical and personal, is a time to stop and consider where you've been and where you're heading. Making things makes us happy.\" Ellis believes a quilt is a great way to mark an occasion, from a birth to a death to a marriage or a divorce. She recently made one for her mother from scraps of her mother's wedding dress, alongside fabrics collected from countries she would have loved to have visited, before she got too elderly. Isn't it a bit morbid, cutting up someone's clothes? \"It's a brave thing to do. But it's actually a celebration of a life,\" Ellis says. \"I made a quilt for a woman in her late 30s whose husband had left her. It symbolised the start of her new life and was mostly pink, a colour he hated.\" Best of all, a quilt is the perfect way to recycle fabric and scraps that might go to waste. \"It weaves together the threads of your life.\" Make a simple quilt A quilt doesn't have to be difficult to make. In essence, it's fabric that you cut up and sew back together again. And it doesn't have to be large. You could make a table runner, or a small, framed quilt. The fabric, design and size are up to you. Find inspiration from paintings, gardens, street maps or anything that moves you. And you don't have to sew the really hard part. There are companies that can do the actual quilting and binding for you. Try Quilt Room or Google \"long-arm quilters\". This design, above, is simple. Each piece is small and almost uniform in size. Gather all the fabrics you want to use, making sure they're clean. Cut your first piece into 22cm strips. Place each strip on a cutting mat and cut random widths, from five to 12cm. You don't need to measure as you'll find you get into a natural rhythm of \"fat, fat, skinny, medium, medium, skinny\" etc. You'll end up with pieces measuring 22cm x 5-12cm. Continue until you have cut all your fabric and pile them up. Pick one piece and sew it to another, joining them along the 22cm length, then add another and another. Just use your own eye and aesthetic. Keep going until you think you are close to your required width, then press all the seams. Start the next row and do the same. Keep sewing rows until you have the length you want. Lay your rows out in an order that you like. Starting at the top, pin two rows together, right sides facing. Sew together and repeat until you have attached all the rows. Press the seams and trim the excess.
