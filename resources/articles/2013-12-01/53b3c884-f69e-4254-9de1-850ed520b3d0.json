Spurs' 4\u20131 victory over Anzhi in the Europa League on Thursday secured a fourth win in five matches, and three points against Liverpool at White Hart Lane would see them go level with their opponents in the Premier League. Holtby, who scored a fine effort against Anzhi, insisted that the result at City is history and that Spurs are close to returning to top form. Asked what has changed in the past two weeks, the German midfielder said: \"I think the belief in ourselves and the way we want to play. The momentum we have now, that winning streak, these good performances in the last two weeks, we have to show it against a big side like Liverpool, especially at home. If we win that game we could bounce maybe to second or third place, and that's what we're aiming for. Now it's on to us to handle that pressure.\" Tottenham have beaten Sunderland and Fulham and drawn with Manchester United since their 6-0 capitulation at Eastlands. Holtby added: \"We played against Man United at home, where we had a lot of pressure on us, had a good result but unfortunately we didn't win that game. Then we got two difficult games against teams who sit with their backs to the wall, had very tough times. It wasn't easy to win both away games but we did that. Now we are ready to play Liverpool, but we have to do the talking on the pitch.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
