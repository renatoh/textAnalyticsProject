The book, which promises to be an entertaining read, aims to build on the success of two other Highdown books by another big-stakes gambler, Dave Nevis on. But word reaches us that the production of a similar book chronicling the life of Harry Findlay, right, has been shelved, despite the newspaper seemingly preparing the ground by sending a reporter out to spend some time with Findlay in Australia a couple of months ago. TELESKY BETTER THAN KAUTO? A new star could have been on show at Enghein racecourse in France on Wednesday. The three-year-old Telesky was an impressive hurdle winner and he boasts some impeccable human connections. He is trained by Serge Foucher, who looked after Kauto Star, below, in the early years of his career, and was \u2013 like last weekend's Grand National winner Mon Mome \u2013 bred by Alexandre Deschere. Foucher is in no doubt that this impressive hurdle winner is going to be very good. \"I think he's even better than Kauto Star at this stage,\" said the trainer. HONEST TRAINER DISCOVERED Commiserations to a Newmarket trainer who, news reaches us, was recently stopped for speeding. Asked by the police if he knew how fast he had been travelling, he replied that he didn't because he was using his mobile phone at the time. It proved to be the wrong answer as he earned a few extra points on his licence. The tale of the trainer's unnecessary honesty has proved popular in the town's pubs in recent days. WHAT COST FRIENDSHIP? Tattenham Corner was pleased to receive a recent email entitled \"Bring a Friend for Free \u2013 Bet 365 Gold Cup Meeting\" from Sandown Park racecourse. However instead of being an opportunity too good to miss, it proved to be a bit of a false dawn given that the generous offer advertised in the title of the email actually turned out to be a deal whereby anyone buying five hospitality packages at \u00a3140 each upwards for the meeting, could claim a sixth one for free. Hardly \"bring a friend for free\". WHAT'S IN A NAME? The excellent website of Roger Curtis (http://www.rogercurtis.com) contains the musings of Maderson Blue, a seven-year-old hurdler with the trainer. Curtis writes: \"As it now appears obligatory to have a blog, there is now, on the site, Maderson Blue's blog, which is all by his own hoof.\" Maderson Blue was named in honour of the Irish painter Arthur Maderson, a contemporary figurative painter who avoids publicity, but does exhibit, above. Maderson Blue made his hurdling debut in February, but the experience did not go to plan, as he explains in his diary. \"When we set off, we seemed to be running in a bumper. It went on and on without anything happening, sort of like The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, but without the hallucinogenic narcotics.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
