This was the chief philosophical question banging around in my head when I came to on the hillside. The string in question was connecting the inside of my nose to a dandelion leaf, perhaps 20cm away. I was on my knees bent double over the pasture, shaking like a sheep, and it was clear that neither the shaking nor any gradual movement towards an upright position was going to sever this viscous coupling. Eventually, my fascination with the mucus tendril wore thinner than the thing itself and I snapped myself upright, no doubt dragging the tendril across my chest, where it was quickly absorbed. I didn't bother to check. Instead I went back to the car, where my wife had spent the last half hour reassuring our two children that Daddy had a very upset tummy and that's why he'd suddenly screeched the car into the farm track and taken off across the field like a hare. Oh, and that funny braying noise from round the bend in the hedge was probably a donkey. It had been such a lovely day. In fact it was the first day that had felt like a lovely day in the four months since my father had died. We were in my favourite bit of Cornwall, above Boscastle - a place to which my family is deeply connected - and we were on our way to some destination that now escapes my memory. My mind was clear, that much I can remember. The day was bright and funky. I felt sentient again. The kids were behaving themselves. The hedges were scrolling by in that faintly oppressive, utterly delightful way Cornish hedges do. I could see all the way forward and all the way back, without meeting obstructions. And then it wasn't clear any more. Something had got in. It was my dad. And it wasn't my dad as an abstraction - a mess of regrets, resentments, philosophical precepts, unexplained mysteries and love - but my dad as my dad. I had the curious sensation that his head was inside my head, like a balaclava fitted to the inside of my skull, and that his features were pressing against the inside of my features. And the fit was too tight. It was uncomfortable. No, it hurt. In fact, shit, this is blinding and I can't really see where I'm going and I must stop the car or the children will be killed, Jesus, there's a farm track, hard left and on the brakes and out we go and full pelt over the grass before my head cracks open ... This whole performance must have taken five to 10 seconds. The next bit took at least half an hour. My memory of it is patchy, but I do remember depositing myself under the lee of a hedge and braying like a donkey. Then my wife arrived, and I managed to stop braying for long enough to send her back to the car while I got on with my business - the car containing a five- and a two-year-old was invisible at least 70m away - and so I brayed and brayed and brayed on my own under the hedge until I was sick. This was the very texture of my grief. I'm sorry it was so sticky and undignified. Let's face it, there are good reasons why we choose to sublimate the snot factor during the period of mourning. And I'm rather embarrassed that it was all so melodramatic. I have always liked a bit of drama, but this took me completely by surprise. I'm not a big weeper by nature, any more than I'm big, strong and silent. I like to think of myself as reasonably sensitive yet attuned to practical issues; in touch with my emotions, but not their servant. In fact, the element of surprise in this episode might have been the point of it all. To get ready for my father's death, I had worked hard over the eight years of his ailing plus the 18 months it took him to die (from cancer of, by the end, just about everything). I had thought my way into every corner and alcove of a father's imminent death, examined every wrinkle in the sleeve of forthcoming woe. I imagined what it must be like to be him - sometimes whole days would be spent inside his head. I even snivelled a bit in private as the end came closer. And I was there in the room with my mum when he went, quietly and very movingly, one clouded hazel eye open and getting clearer with every passing minute. The hour or two we spent with his body will remain with me for the rest of my life as the occasion on which I learned by experience, rather than by protestation, that life persists because of love. Afterwards I sat up in my mother's house - just her house now - till the sky went peacock blue. I felt as alive as I have ever felt. I wished my two sisters were there; it seemed unfair that it had happened on my shift and not theirs. And then we did the crematorium and the memorial service - \"mops and buckets please to be allocated to the family pew, for deployment during Never Weather-Beaten Sail\", Mum said - and got on with it: me, the girls, my mum, my aunt, my wife, my children, all the people whose lives had been in one way or another included in my dad's. We got on with it and waited out our grief, going about it in our different ways. And if there's one other thing I've learned from my father's death, it's that, no matter how clever, sophisticated, sensitive, grown-up and prepared you are, you cannot second-guess the mourning process. It is a process without reason. Every day is different and fails, utterly, to measure up to expectation. Indeed, the only thing that is certain about grief is that it will certainly get you. If you accept it, it will engulf you; if you step out of its way, it will follow you; if you negotiate with it, it will outflank you. Grief has its own terms and they are never the same as yours. That's the point of it. My friend Gary has recently had a bout with it. In fact it's ongoing. His father died in February, in his bed at home after four years of illness. Gary spent those four years preparing himself for the moment. When it came - suddenly and without warning - he wasn't there. Nevertheless, he saw the body, touched it, wept unselfconsciously and got on with the arrangements. His mother needed a lot of looking after. The hardest part for him was hearing his mother crying in anguish and rage in her bedroom after the body had gone, \"like a very distressed little girl - she completely disintegrated to the point where she didn't seem like my mum any more\". Like me, Gary spent the next few months getting on with it, hobbled by a certain background heaviness but functioning reasonably well as a dad and a man. Then, in August, he went on holiday with his family to a campsite in Biarritz. The weather was horrible, the children fought and moaned, the mobile home they'd hired got smaller and smaller and then ... wham! Gary found himself back in Selsey, aged seven, in a mobile home, in teeming rain, moaning and complaining at his father, while all about him had a bad time. \"I was being an ungrateful, grumpy little shit,\" he says, \"not joining in with anything, refusing to enjoy myself - just like my children were now.\" Out of nowhere, he sank into four days of bottomless gloom, tearful, angry and resentful. \"I just wanted to go home ... \" Gary and I are very different personalities. But we were both determined to pre-rationalise our experience of death: to second-guess grief. It was only when we let our guards down, took ourselves out into the country, got in touch with nature and, through nature, our childhoods, that grief hit us hardest. \"I'm not surprised by that,\" says Annie Kiff-Wood of the charity Cruse Bereavement Care. \"Both of you had temporarily released yourselves from normal routines and left behind the brakes and barriers we all keep in place to check our moods and personalities. It is commonly the case that people who spend a long time preparing themselves for bereavement take longest to experience the full impact. \"And let's not forget,\" she adds, \"that the death of a parent is among the hardest to deal with - your relationship with your parents is absolutely unique in your life. It is impossible to replace what a parent has given you.\" Cruse finds that the majority of the calls it receives now come from people in their 30s and 40s who have lost a parent. Four years on from my unsavoury outburst in Cornwall, I find that I am able to miss my old man in a way that seems proper and dignified - in a way that approximates to the mode I spent nearly 10 years anticipating and practising for. I would say that the period of active, unpredictable, assaulting grief lasted perhaps six months and then settled into something much less abusive - my primal-donkey moment was undoubtedly the cathartic jumping-off point. There are triggers that still set me off, of course. You can't play Campion lute songs anywhere near me for a start, or say the word \"Tripoli\". But after four years, grief has become a well-mannered companion. I am looking at my dear wife right now. She is disassembling before my eyes on the other side of the kitchen table. Her father died at the weekend. I'm wondering what I should say to her. \u00b7 Call Cruse Bereavement Care on 0870 1671677 or visit crusebereavementcare.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
