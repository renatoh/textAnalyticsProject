There\u2019s something about the picture of an older woman having tea by the window at the Criterion Grill that reminded me of the Penrith Tea Rooms from Withnail and I and its pearl-clutching customers. One in four people in Lytham St Annes was aged 60 or over at the time. \u2018Old age and death,\u2019 the article grimly informs us, \u2018are two of the major service industries in the town. The only civic development since the Second World War has been the crematorium\u2026 death, like socialism, is omnipresent, but nowhere visible. These are the two main enemies of the majority of the people.\u2019 Prophetically for the 1980s and beyond, 80% of the Fylde coast was employed in the service sector, and just 18% in manufacturing \u2013 \u2018a metaphor for the Conservative dream,\u2019 as the authors say. But these \u2018affluent refugees from the industrial towns\u2019 rub shoulders with \u2018the wealthy poor\u2019, who are concealing their poverty under their mink coats. Even those suffering blame it on \u2018years of socialism\u2019. Just as austerity was sold by the Tories after 2008, so was the recession at the time. One of the older women at Taylor\u2019s coffee shop says: \u2018It\u2019s taken years to get into this mess, it\u2019s not going to be cured overnight. The medicine won\u2019t be very pleasant.\u2019 Then there\u2019s the maxim farmers were fond of: \u2018Conservatives break the farmer, but Labour breaks the country.\u2019 Which returns us again to Withnail and I and Uncle Monty: \u2018Shat on by Tories, shovelled up by Labour.\u2019 The whole subtext of the piece is that Thatcherism is dying, if not already dead. If only that were the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
