The Labor leader will appear before the press club on Friday as the Shorten camp remains unhappy with Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson\u2019s decision to foreground the former leader\u2019s lack of popularity as one of the factors behind the election defeat. While the campaign review was generally well received within Labor ranks as a solid and constructive bit of analysis, there was some push back at Thursday\u2019s national executive meeting, and internally, about invoking popularity as a measure of the success or failure of leadership. As one Labor source put it: \u201cThey\u2019ve jammed Albo now by saying only a popular leader can win an election \u2013 so if he is less popular than Morrison before the next election, do they dump him?\u201d The official campaign review, released on Thursday, found that Labor lost the federal election because of three overriding reasons: weak strategy, poor adaptability and an unpopular leader. \u201cLabor lost the election because of a weak strategy that could not adapt to the change in Liberal leadership, a cluttered policy agenda that looked risky and an unpopular leader,\u201d the review says. \u201cNo one of these shortcomings was decisive but in combination they explain the result.\u201d The review flagged significant problems with the organisation of the campaign, with advertising and polling, with the digital strategy, and with internal culture. It says the campaign \u201clacked a culture and structure that encouraged dialogue and challenge, which led to the dismissal of warnings from within the party about the campaign\u2019s direction\u201d. It says Labor lost votes among low-income workers, Christians and in the coal regions in New South Wales and Queensland, but gained votes among high-income voters in the cities concerned about the Coalition\u2019s lack of action on climate change. Weatherill, who briefed Shorten on the findings before the review went to the national executive, told reporters he could not ignore the former leader\u2019s longstanding unpopularity with voters. \u201cWe arrived at a conscientious view based on the evidence that Bill\u2019s leadership made a contribution to the loss, not the only contribution, but part of the story.\u201d \u201cWe arrived at that view based on evidence, and obviously there are lots of different perspectives that have been put to us, but we have remained steadfast in that view,\u201d the former South Australian premier said. \u201cWe think it would have been wrong for us to place all of the blame on Bill Shorten\u2019s leadership. We think that would have been a wrong analysis and not based on the evidence. We think it would also have been wrong to say he played no role, his leadership played no role\u201d. Albanese will use a speech to the press club to respond to the key findings and recommendations, which include a call for Labor to pursue legislation capping individual political donations, and legislation for truth in political advertising \u2013 both in response to Clive Palmer\u2019s impact on the contest. The Labor leader will pledge to hold a national conference next December, and to create structures for collaborative policy-making. The speech will acknowledge that Labor has heard the rebuke from part of its base in May, and it will send a message to colleagues that the time for seminars is over. Shorten declared in advance of the review\u2019s release on Thursday that he was staying in public life for another 20 years, and said if the universe was \u201cto grant re-runs, I would campaign with fewer messages, more greatly emphasise the jobs opportunities in renewable energies, and take a different position on franking credits\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
