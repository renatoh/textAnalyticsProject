Vintage \u00a39.99 Heilpern's gleeful biography redresses all the cliches surrounding playwright John Osborne. Here was a man whose life was a compendium of feeling, a tortured, rebellious youth whose deep sensitivity to criticism was matched only by his ability to dish it out, often with savage, malicious cruelty. His plays were like nothing anyone had ever seen before, but he packed his characters so full of bitter rage that they leapt from the stage and into society, an epochal moment in the history of British culture. Heilpern never lets himself get bogged down in the tortuous disintegrations of Osborne's private life and his joyful book is as much a tribute to the dashing, rakish charm without as the anguished soul within. Knowing that the man himself would have hated it is all part of the fun. The Innocent Man, by John Grisham. Century \u00a312.99 This non-fictional book by novelist John Grisham ends when Ron Williamson, the innocent man of the title, is cleared by DNA evidence. Fingered for a murder he could never have committed, Williamson spent 11 years on Death Row, an appalling miscarriage of justice. Grisham fills page after page with his usual legal shtick, never seeming to acknowledge that, when we know what is going to happen, plot alone will not fill the gap. Not only is Grisham unable to make us care about his characters, but he also seems unaware of what this case says about the systemic flaws that continue to vitiate the American criminal justice system, in particular an absurd reliance on polygraphs and a primitive drug-based understanding of mental illness. This is Grisham's first foray into 'true crime'. He should stick to what he is good at. Donne: The Reformed Soul, by John Stubbs Penguin \u00a39.99 'Every man is a little world,' John Donne once wrote. 'Every man is a little church too; and in every man there are two sides, two armies: the flesh fights against the spirit.' In this stylish biography, Stubbs picks apart the agonised conflicts of Donne's world - and his church - and turns them into a dazzling portrait of the age. In Donne, the corporeal and the spiritual fought like rabid dogs. His life was marked for ever by his youthful decision to renounce Catholicism for a more politically acceptable set of beliefs. He was forced to give up his career when his secret marriage to Ann More offended her powerful family. When he accepted a position in the Church of England, he was forced to conceal many of his true opinions. Intimate and measured, Stubbs renders Donne with skill and verve. Waxing Mythical: The Life and Legend of Madame Tussaud, by Kate Berridge John Murray \u00a39.99 Few people know Madame Tussaud beyond her brand of London waxworks. Berridge's biography rescues this remarkable woman from her own myth, restoring her as near to life as the thin source material will allow. Born in France in 1761, Marie Tussaud was beginning to make her way in glamorous and decadent Paris when the ancien regime powder-keg exploded, pitching Europe into a revolutionary chaos from which it has never really recovered. Berridge brilliantly captures Tussaud's place in her time, first under the shadow of the guillotine, then in anxious petit-bourgeois Britain, where she moved in 1802. The constant theme in Tussaud's life was the making and keeping of money. From the traces of her dry, commercial spirit, Berridge recreates the birth pangs of the modern age. All Round Genius: The Unknown Story of Britain's Greatest Sportsman, by Mick Collins. Aurum \u00a37.99 Of all yesteryear's unassuming heroes, Max Woosnam may well be the greatest. Born in north Wales in 1892, Woosnam had all-round sporting gifts which brought him Olympic gold and the captaincy of England at both football and tennis. In many ways though, these were the least of his achievements. Returning home from the First World War, his varied career took him as far as Hollywood, where he defeated Charlie Chaplin at table tennis. Collins tells this remarkable tale with love and enthusiasm, rendering a portrait of Woosnam that brings into stark relief the behaviour of today's sporting stars. This is an engaging book, one that leaves you yearning for the old days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
