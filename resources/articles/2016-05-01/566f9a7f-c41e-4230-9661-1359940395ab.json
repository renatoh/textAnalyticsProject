Gayle was widely condemned at the start of the year for asking the reporter Mel McLaughlin out on a date on live television when playing in Australia\u2019s Big Bash League, saying: \u201cYour eyes are beautiful, hopefully we can win this game and then we can have a drink after as well. Don\u2019t blush, baby.\u201d And now speaking to Charlotte Edwardes, in an article published by the Times magazine, Gayle claims to have \u201ca very, very big bat, the biggest in the wooooorld,\u201d before adding: \u201cYou think you could lift it? You\u2019d need two hands.\u201d According to the piece, Gayle goes on to ask Edwardes how many black men she has \u201chad\u201d before inquiring as to whether she has ever had a \u201ct\u2019eesome\u201d. He then asks Edwardes if she dyes her hair while flicking his eyes downwards, according to her account of the exchange. Later on in the interview he says \u201cwomen should have equality and they do have equality. They have more than equality. Women can do what they want. Jamaican women are very vocal. They will let you know what time is it, for sure.\u201d With Gayle warming to his equality theme, Edwardes asks about sharing domestic duties such as cooking and looking after a baby and he adds: \u201cNo, that OK. [With a baby] then she doesn\u2019t have to [cook]. We can stop and buy a meal. If she\u2019s working, then the couple share. First person home, cooks.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cwomen should please their man. When he comes home, food is on the table. Serious. You ask your husband what he likes and then you make it.\u201d On homophobia, however, Gayle said: \u201cThe culture I grew up in, gays were negative. [But] people can do whatever they want. You can\u2019t tell someone how to live their life. It\u2019s a free world.\u201d Gayle, who was fined Aus$10,000 in January by his employers Melbourne Renegades for the exchange with McLaughlin, is due to play in England this summer for Somerset in the NatWest T20 Blast, his second time at the county following a brief three-match spell last year. Somerset\u2019s chief executive, Guy Lavender, who said Gayle\u2019s comments in January were \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d, declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian on Friday, having not read the Times interview, but added: \u201cBroadly speaking, when he was with us he was fantastic both in terms of activities on and off the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
