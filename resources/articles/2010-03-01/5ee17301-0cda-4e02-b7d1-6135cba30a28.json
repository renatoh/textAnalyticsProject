Only the Sound Remains, for viola and small orchestra, is Skempton's latest work for Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, commissioned for its violist Christopher Yates, and takes its title from the first line of Edward Thomas's The Mill-Water. The sense of nostalgia and elegy that pervades Thomas's poem runs through Skempton's 35-minute piece. The viola leads the way through a series of ruminative episodes, touching on the pastoral world of Vaughan Williams and the shifting colour fields of Morton Feldman, while always remaining totally truthful to Skempton's own vision, and his precious ability to find beauty and expressive power in the simplest musical objects. James Weeks conducted the premiere, beginning a Skempton portrait concert that was shared between BCMG and Weeks's own vocal ensemble EXAUDI. A selection from Skempton's recent outpouring of choral pieces \u2013 every one setting their poetic texts, ranging from The Song of Solomon to WB Yeats, with totally clarity and tact \u2013 was interleaved with exquisite examples of his instrumental miniatures: Two Interludes for cello played by Ulrich Heinen, Two for Guitar played by James Woodrow. There was another new work, which had been dedicated to Skempton. Slow Pan, by 22-year-old Charlie Usher, who won the Guardian's young composer competition in 2004, is essentially an extended piano solo, played by Malcolm Wilson, to which six more instruments add occasional commentary and definition. It takes chances, but most of them come off impressively. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 March 2010. The original gave Charlie Usher's age as 23. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
