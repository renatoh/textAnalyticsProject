Most flights to the USA are leaving Britain today. If you have a confirmed ticket, it is now safe to assume you'll be able to travel. Is it worth getting to the airport early? BA are asking people not to arrive earlier than the usual specified check-in time. However, most airlines are asking passengers to make their way to the gate promptly and carry minimal hand-luggage. To avoid lengthy searches and confiscations, please be aware that all sharp objects are now banned in the cabin, including the following: replica guns (plastic or metal); household cutlery; knives with blades of any length; letter openers; razor blades; tradesmen's tools; scissors; knitting needles; sports goods such as rackets, cricket bats, golf clubs and darts. Any chance of cancelling my trip? British travellers due to take a package holiday to America in the next week may be offered compensation, if they have booked with a UK Federation of Tour Operators member. The FTO has agreed to offer free cancellation or transfer to alternative holidays, where available, to those travelling on package holidays to New York or Washington DC for departures up to midnight on Friday September 21. The deadline for cancelling/transferring departures for elsewhere in the US or Canada passed at midnight on Tuesday September 18. Are flights to non-American destinations affected? BA flights to Islamabad are still cancelled. Most European scheduled flights may be slightly delayed due to heavy security but should go ahead. Try to arrive at airports at least two hours before departure. All airlines are appealing for passengers to keep hand luggage to a minimum and avoid packing sharp objects to avoid searches and delays. Is there thought to be any risk to tourists abroad? The Foreign Office said that while it is not aware of any specific threat to British nationals overseas, travellers should keep a low profile and maintain a high level of vigilance, avoiding demonstrations and public events. It advises against travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan and says all Britons should leave those two countries if possible. Can I claim on insurance for delays? Probably not - a common clause says insurers will not cover loss or damage \"directly or indirectly caused by war, terrorism, revolution or any other similar event\". But you could be eligible for compensation if you cancel - see below.
