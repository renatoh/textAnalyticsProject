It was also the one occasion a home team outscored its opponents on tries and in total the European teams scored 13 against 32, five of them coming in the last two matches between Ireland and New Zealand, then Wales and Australia. In contrast the penalty tally went the other way, 33-23, and with statistics showing that the vast majority of Test matches are won by the team that scores the more tries, it is the ability of the southern teams to create under pressure that continues to mark them out. 2 Back to the future The southern hemisphere teams have backs who stand out in an era when the hit is king. Even South Africa, who still base their game on physically dominating opponents, are not immune to razzle-dazzle, with the full-back Willie le Roux personifying how they have recalibrated their game. New Zealand, with Dan Carter, right, playing only a bit-part last month, had Julian Savea, Israel Dagg and Ma'a Nonu to make good the loss while Quade Cooper was a key difference on Saturday as Australia again overcame Wales, with his ability to move the ball wide under pressure. Wales badly missed Jonathan Davies and still struggle to bring Leigh Halfpenny into the line and, overall, the north lacks the craft of the south. 3 World Cup pointers England, the hosts, had the best month of the Six Nations sides, beating Australia and leading against New Zealand with 17 minutes to go, despite being without a number of players. They have been consistent under Stuart Lancaster without being outstanding, hard to beat but lacking a wow factor. Wales, the championship winners for the past two years, have the muscle butnot the wit; Ireland are volatile, poorone week and outstanding the next; Scotland struggle to make much of possession, like Italy; while France had a miserable year with their only victories coming against Scotland and Tonga but in Wesley Fofana they have the outstanding three-quarter in Europe. Things can only get better. 4 Southern comfort It was a gruelling month for Argentina, whose Europe-based players are playing all year round. Victory over Italy was their only solace last month but some of their squad are moving to Super 15 sides. New Zealand won 14 out of 14 this year, pushed hard by England, France and Ireland, but always able to work their way out of trouble and make decisive plays. South Africa have made significant advances under Heyneke Meyer, looking multi-dimensional without losing sight of where they came from, and their games against the All Blacks in next year's Rugby Championship promise to be epic. Australia looked forlorn at Twickenham but four successive victories and the rehabilitation of Quade Cooper will send them into the new year with hope. They did not buckle against Wales's physical onslaught and moments of the highest class behind won them the match. 5 Refereeing Australia and New Zealand struggled to deal with the way the breakdown is refereed in Europe, complaining that sides were able to slow the ball down, but with the World Cup hosted by England in two years, they will have to get used to it. Why there is a variation in approach between the hemispheres is something that only the International Rugby Board can answer but, as the All Blacks found in 2007 and 2011, staging a World Cup has its advantages on the field. The forward pass has become confusing with physics being applied to the law. In certain instances a pass may now go forward as, if the passer's hands are pointing backwards, it does not matter where the ball ends up. It is something to do withmomentum. TheWales coach, Warren Gatland, moaned about Australia's third try but Wales's second against Tonga the previous week came after a moreblatantly forward pass.
