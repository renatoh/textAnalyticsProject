Facebook and Twitter are effective channels for customer service, and are great spaces through which to explain brand values. But social media users are likely to be put off by overt attempts to shift products \u2013 which means marketers looking for an easily measured return on investment are likely to be disappointed. Justeat.co.uk, a website through which people can order takeaway food from local outlets, has more than one million fans on its Facebook page and 40,000 Twitter followers. The company uses BuddyMedia for its Facebook engagement and the tool is crucial for managing social media channels between different departments within the business. But digital marketing director Tess Tucker says it took a while for the brand to learn how to get the most out of social media. Its Facebook page was set up by the company's marketing department, but users flooded it with customer-service issues, reporting problems in the system or complaining about a late-arriving pizza. \"We, in marketing, felt responsible, but the questions customers were asking were out of office hours and there was no one in the department to respond \u2013 and, anyway, they wouldn't know how to handle those questions,\" Tucker says. This problem was addressed by giving the Just Eat customer-service team access to the Facebook page and accepting that it is an important customer-service channel. The Just Eat Facebook page is still used for creating conversations with customers and telling people about the brand. \"It is not about driving orders: a lot of activity is around supporting what our brand stands for and being entertaining. If you are going to be in people's feeds, you have to earn the right to be there or you turn them off,\" Tucker says. Some Facebook pages can become cluttered, featuring complaints, praise, customer-service queries, ad campaigns, ethical concerns, competitions and offers. First Direct bank has tried to keep customer service separate from its social interactions on social media. Head of social media Rebecca Dye says: \"We have a Facebook account and two Twitter handles, one dedicated to customer service. We made the decision early on to have a very clear channel where we have those conversations. We can direct people there, they know it exists and will always get an answer.\" For First Direct, says Dye, the big draw of using social media is in recreating a sense of community with users. \"If you ring us and want to pay a bill, we have a chat with you. Conversation is what our reputation is built on. If you are only logging into internet banking, the relationship becomes much more transactional. With social media, we are able to bring those conversations back. \"Our Facebook page is based on having conversations, not pushing sales and product. It is about helping people understand what makes us tick as a brand.\" When Dye joined First Direct two years ago, she was doubtful people would want to spend time having general-interest conversations with a bank. But she says people really do want to talk about diverse subjects on the bank's Facebook page, which has about 28,000 fans. Caspar Nelson, head of brand communications at Phones 4u, says rival phone retailers, such as Carphone Warehouse, spend twice as much on marketing, but that budgets don't count when it comes to social media. \"It is about creating great content and engagement without laying out a lot of cash,\" he says. If customers voice issues about service on the Phones 4u Facebook page, Nelson adds: \"By having an industry-leading customer service social strategy, yes an initial post might be negative, but hopefully we can be seen to be finding a solution and turning that into a positive. Once they [customers] become advocates, that really is powerful.\" The mobile-phone retailer has launched an integrated marketing campaign to persuade people to upgrade their phones. The campaign includes TV ads that show Phones 4u staff offering newly single people better partners. For the first time, the retailer is putting a strong focus on social media: using the hashtag #projectupgrade, it is asking people to upload ideas for other things in their lives that they would like to upgrade, whether it be their house, car or bank balance. The authors of the most persuasive entries will have their wishes granted. However, TV and print advertising is still vital for directing people to social media. \"I can't imagine using social media instead of above-the-line advertising \u2013 they are very much complementary,\" says Nelson. \"Some brands, such as Red Bull, can just concentrate on social media, but even they use some above-the-line advertising to support their presence.\" Brands have to beware of what consultant Paul Armstrong calls \"brandfill\", whereby they jump on the latest bandwagon simply to have something to talk about on social media. The theme may be newsworthy, but it will do little to build their brand values \u2013 and could even damage them, Armstrong warns. \"Brands are jumping on the news of the moment and putting something out for clicks and engagement. But my worry is, what does it do for them in the long term? It stays in people's minds.\" He wonders whether some of the brand activity surrounding the Royal baby \u2013 he mentions ads by Oreo and Coke \u2013 really have enough synergy with the event to justify their activities. Oreo tweeted a picture of a baby's bottle on a stately looking cushion, with an Oreo biscuit balanced beside it. The headline ran: \"Prepare the royal bottle service.\" Coke ran a press ad with two bottles of Coke labelled \"Wills\" and \"Kate\", and announcing: \"Time for a royal celebration. Share a bottle with Wills and Kate.\" So brands must rethink their approach to marketing on social media. Traditional media can build brands and push sales. Social media give consumers the chance to answer back, so brands need to make sure they are listening and can engage with what users are saying. The use of social media is about joining a conversation rather than blaring out a message from a megaphone.
