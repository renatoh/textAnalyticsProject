The election of a new Speaker should have been a relatively simple process. A straightforward elimination contest even an averagely dysfunctional organisation could probably have got wrapped up in a couple of hours. Tops. There were no last-minute backroom deals to be made by the candidates \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll grant you a couple of urgent questions if you vote for me\u201d \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t even as if every MP was that bothered who won. Just 562 out of a possible 650 turned up for the first round of voting. But still somehow the Commons managed to make a meal of it. Twenty minutes for new ballot papers to be printed between each round because MPs couldn\u2019t be trusted to remember who had already been eliminated moments earlier. Another 20 minutes to vote. Five minutes for the tellers to count the handful of votes and then 45 minutes to bugger about chatting in the tearooms. It was almost as if everyone was desperate to do anything but think about the general election. But all bad things come to an end and Lindsay Hoyle was finally duly elected. In line with tradition, the new Speaker was dragged to the chair. Labour\u2019s Caroline Flint and Conservative Nigel Evans did the honours. Hoyle began by thanking his family and making a moving tribute to his daughter Natalie who had taken her own life in 2017. \u201cShe will always be missed,\u201d he said. He went on to promise to make the house a model of tolerance and respect. We can always hope. Ken Clarke, the father of the house, had got proceedings under way with a genial mumble by inviting the seven candidates to give a five-minute stump speech to the Commons. Most followed much the same format. They were all definitely not going to be like the previous Speaker. Promises to be an umpire not a player. The sound of the clock being rewound was audible. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. In this particular election, Bercow was the new anti-Christ. To hint that anything he had done during his time in office might have been in any way progressive or of value was to risk instant elimination at the hands of grumpy Brexiters. Even when they were planning on continuing some of Bercow\u2019s innovations, they were at pains to accentuate the differences. Doublespeak has seldom been so finessed. Rosie Winterton kicked things off by saying how she was determined to lower the temperature and keep statements and prime minister\u2019s questions short. Unfortunately it took her well over a minute longer than her allotted five to say how brief she was going to be. Not the best of starts. Chris Bryant went out of his way to praise the intellect and sincerity of the house. No one would be more \u201cEver so \u2019umble\u201d to serve. He also declared he would stamp out clapping in the chamber. Something that was greeted with a prolonged round of applause. It had always been a mystery why Edward Leigh had nominated himself. Not least to Leigh himself, as he is a man of little charm and to whom almost no one in the Commons looks up. His interventions usually inspire a mass exodus from the chamber. This time he was just heard in silence as he rambled inconsequentially about refurbishment. Meg Hillier also realised she was a rank outsider but was determined to go down in flames. She used her time to say there were many MPs who were bullies whom no one wanted to work for and everyone knew who they were. Yup. And they wouldn\u2019t be voting for her. Eleanor Laing spoke with great theatricality \u2013 \u201cLittle Eleanor\u201d she called herself \u2013 and her thinly disguised anti-Bercow diatribe ended in a whisper. Harriet Harman talked of all the different roles she had taken in the Commons and the importance of having a second woman as Speaker as she tried, unsuccessfully, to convince MPs that she wasn\u2019t the continuity Bercow candidate. Hoyle spoke with the gravitas of a man who knew the job was his for the taking. He was the Man. There would be no emergency S024 debates or breaches with conventions on his watch, thank you very much. Brexit would be safe in his hands. The first ballot ended with Leigh and Hillier eliminated, having only scraped together 22 votes between them. After signing a few souvenir order papers for Tory MPs \u2013 look out for them on eBay later \u2013 Clarke looked hopefully towards the other candidates and invited them all to have a 10-minute think about whether they really wanted to prolong the agony. \u201cPlease, Rosie,\u201d dozens of MPs muttered pleadingly. Winterton ignored them and pointedly walked out the other end of the chamber. Still five in it. A lifetime later and the results of the second ballot were counted. Winterton was out and Harman bowed to the inevitable and called it a day. Bercow-lite was never going to cut it. The thanks she got from the entire house was heartfelt. Then into an entirely new space-time continuum for the third vote. In which two MPs managed to spoil their ballot. Either they are technically braindead or have no homes to go to. To no great surprise, Hoyle was still streets ahead, though below the magic 50% figure. So Laing was next out and everyone turned towards Bryant, imploring him to do the decent thing. No such luck. \u201cI\u2019m here for the duration,\u201d he said, thereby guaranteeing him the undying hatred of all those who had vote for Laing. Hoyle it would be. Just not yet. No one had realised just how long eternity could be. John Crace\u2019s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by Guardian Faber.
