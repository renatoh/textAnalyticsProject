The leader of the house was forced to drop his proposal for an alternative vote system - where MPs would have listed the options in order of preference, ensuring at least one passed - due to widespread opposition. But the system he has now outlined has raised reformers' concerns that they face a repeat of the 2003 \"fiasco\" when the Commons rejected all options in a series of free votes. They argue possible compromises fell because people held out for later options with a larger elected component. They fear offering an ascending proportion of elected representatives again - from an entirely appointed house through to an entirely elected one - will result in another stalemate. Chris Bryant MP, who will on Monday chair a cross-party Unlock Democracy rally calling for the maximum elected component possible, said: \"We will be trying to persuade Jack to go from 100% elected down.\" But he added: \"We are not purists and don't want to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Personally, I will vote for 50% as well as 80%.\" Mr Straw will lift a standing order which prevents contradictory motions being passed - allowing people to support a 50% elected house, but still have a chance to vote for an 80% elected house. The free vote will not bind the government. But many MPs fear the system is a recipe for confusion, suggesting it is hard to argue that a later option with a small majority should supercede an earlier one with a large majority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
