The 32-year-old, a member of England\u2019s T20 squad in New Zealand, had two seasons left on his contract at Lord\u2019s but was given permission to take up a four-year deal at Headingley without any compensation being sought. The catalyst for his switch came midway through a campaign in which Middlesex missed out on promotion, with the combination of Malan, in his second season as the captain, and Law, in his first as coach, not working out. \u201cI just needed a fresh challenge,\u201d Malan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been captain for two years and I\u2019ve been banging my head against a wall for a wee while. I didn\u2019t really enjoy the cricket as much as I\u2019d have liked to.\u201d Asked to elaborate, Malan replied: \u201cThe new coach has come in and you want the club to move in the right direction. [But] I didn\u2019t really know what was going on and what the plans were and so on, and that frustrated me.\u201d Malan discovered the Australian\u2019s vision in fact matched his own but only after resolving to leave and there appear to be few hard feelings after praising the \u201cfantastic\u201d staff who looked after him \u201clike a family\u201d during 13 years at the club. The left-hander, who was part of the 2016 title-winning team and averaged 47 in Division Two last summer, represents a strong signing by Yorkshire, who in their official release spoke of an over-reliance on on the runs of Gary Ballance. Malan said: \u201cYorkshire, when I spoke to them, seemed like a team that really want to win trophies. I don\u2019t want to finish my career just plodding along in county cricket. The grass might not be greener. I might not score more runs but at least I\u2019m going to challenge myself to still work hard and be better than I was.\u201d While still involved in England\u2019s limited overs set-up and desperate to be in next year\u2019s T20 World Cup squad despite knowing many rested senior players will return, Malan won the last of his 15 Test caps in 2018 and was again overlooked for the second leg of this New Zealand tour. Ed Smith, the national selector, said on dropping Malan that \u201cit may be his game is better suited to overseas conditions\u201d. But the player, who struck a maiden Test century in Perth during the 2017-18 Ashes series yet averaged 27.8 overall, is not giving up. Malan said: \u201cWhat Ed said wasn\u2019t ideal but he\u2019s clarified it to me \u2013 my Test record in England isn\u2019t as good as it should be, which is my own fault and no one else\u2019s. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t play Test cricket again. It\u2019s up to me to score runs for Yorkshire and keep my name in the hat. \u201cJonny Bairstow has been left out [of the Test squad for New Zealand] and there are a few other guys pushing for spots. But there\u2019s no one really nailed down apart from Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Rory Burns, who played exceptionally well in the Ashes. \u201cYou never want other people to do badly but if opportunities arise you want to be scoring runs in domestic cricket. That\u2019s all I want to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
