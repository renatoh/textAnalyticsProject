The Kampala Child Protection Ordinance 2019 also criminalises children loitering in public places, begging or soliciting, vending or hawking, and bans the sale of alcohol and drugs to children. Kampala\u2019s deputy Lord Mayor, Sarah Kanyike, said the law would control the influx of street children and encourage voluntary initiatives to help them leave the streets. \u201cAll along we have had no law governing these children. This bill provides for protection of children against certain forms of exploitation and sexual abuse. We have put [in place] penalties for the offenders,\u201d Kanyike said. Offenders face up to six months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of 40,000 Ugandan shillings (\u00a39), or both. At least 10,000 to 15,000 children, mainly from the semi-arid north-east Karamoja region, live on the streets in Kampala, according to government estimates. \u201cWe have nowhere to go. It\u2019s through begging that we earn a living,\u201d said 14-year-old Esther. \u201cWe are not scared and [we are] ready to face the [legal] consequences.\u201d The law is \u201cfirefighting\u201d, warned Ariong Moses, president of the Global Health Corps Fellowship Alumni Association of Uganda, as it doesn\u2019t address the origins of the problem. \u201cWe are running away from addressing the root causes that have brought so many children to the streets, instead opting to punish those who try to help them. Those kids need help, not isolation and segregation,\u201d Moses said. Other activists have welcomed the new legislation as a way to prevent people from seeking to exploit youngsters. \u201cWe believe that this law, if well implemented, will help us in reducing the pull factors and making the streets as difficult as possible, particularly for the exploiters,\u201d said Faith Atwine, deputy director communications, strategy and impact at Dwelling Places, Uganda. \u201cWe believe [the law] will go a long way in reducing the magnitude of the problem. Children will not come to the streets to beg if they are receiving nothing from the streets,\u201d she said. However, she cautioned: \u201cWe have to stay alert and watch out for any new ideas that these exploiters might come up with, so that we are able to act immediately to ensure children are protected from exploitation by selfish people out there.\u201d Lack of jobs, neglect, parents\u2019 failure to adequately provide for children\u2019s needs and high poverty rates are among the factors that drive children to a life on the streets. Some eight million or 21.4% of Ugandans are living in poverty, according to the revised National Household Survey report published in January 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
