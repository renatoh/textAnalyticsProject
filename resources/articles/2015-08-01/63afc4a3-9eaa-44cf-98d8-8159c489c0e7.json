In whirlwind fashion a host of Tottenham greats, from Bill Nicholson to Gareth Bale, are displayed alongside thunderous music and a cinematic voiceover, which, at the end, affirms the club\u2019s motto: \u201cTo dare is to do.\u201d It\u2019s very dramatic, a little over-the-top and, on Saturday, somewhat contradictory. Because Tottenham\u2019s performance here was one which did not live up to that tradition of showing dare. Quite the opposite, in fact, as a team who were 2-0 up at half-time and largely in control crumbled under pressure from their opponents. There was absence of courage, of belief, and ultimately that cost them two points. These remain early days, of course, and the team will get sharper both mentally and physically. But given Spurs\u2019 poor home record last season \u2013 they lost six of their 19 league fixtures at this venue \u2013 the concern is that what took place at the weekend is part of a long-term trend. Another concern, which was vocalised by one furious home supporter sitting near the press box, is that this is a team which remains reliant on Harry Kane to kill off the opposition. The forward was withdrawn on 64 minutes due, in the words of Mauricio Pochettino, to \u201ctiredness\u201d. Kane certainly looked short of his best and, indeed, failed to convert a golden opportunity early in the second half to put the hosts 3-0 up. But it was telling that, when he was replaced by \u00c9rik Lamela, the visitors sensed their opportunity had come to get back into this match. \u201cHarry\u2019s an incredible player, so to see him go off was a relief,\u201d said the Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland. \u201cIt gave us more time on the ball as Spurs tried to sit in and see the win out. We got hold of the game and started to dictate it.\u201d Indeed they did, pushing the home team further and further back until they conceded through Marko Arnautovic\u2019s 78th-minute penalty and Mame Biram Diouf\u2019s header five minute later. Stoke had their reward for showing persistence and craft. Spurs, on the other hand, were left to rue what might have been having led through Eric Dier\u2019s header and Nacer Chadli\u2019s volley in first-half stoppage time. Their collapse cannot be put down solely to Kane\u2019s withdrawal, especially given the suspect nature of Spurs\u2019 defending all afternoon. But such is the 22-year-old\u2019s status at the club after his stunning exploits last season, it is natural that opposition teams should get a lift when he departs from the action, and particularly when that means the team does not have a striker on the pitch. That it has come to this reflects poorly on Spurs. It has been obvious for months that they need a recognised goalscorer given the failings of Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado \u2013 the former is no longer with a squad number while the latter has joined Villarreal \u2013 and Kane, as Pochettino stated himself, was always going to enter the season significantly short of fitness given the extended holiday he took after representing England at the European Under-21 Championship. But two games in and the search continues. Spurs have signed the Cameroon forward Njie Clinton from Lyon but, aged 22 and having scored just seven goals in 30 games in Ligue 1 last season, he cannot be deemed the solution. \u201cThe transfer window is still open when you start the season and maybe it\u2019s a good thing to fix for the future,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cWe need one or two players more, yes.\u201d Saido Berahino is supposedly on his way to White Hart Lane from West Bromwich Albion, with QPR\u2019s Charlie Austin also a reported target. What is for sure is that a club which prides itself on its attacking principles, of daring until the death, needs frontline reinforcements. Stoke, meanwhile, appear to have concluded their summer business after the arrival of Xherdan Shaqiri and the 23-year-old, who was suspended for this match, is sure to bolster a squad that looks capable of bettering last season\u2019s ninth-place finish. \u201cMore goals, more clean sheets, more wins, more points,\u201d added Butland. \u201cWe just want to improve.\u201d Man of the match Stephen Ireland (Stoke)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
