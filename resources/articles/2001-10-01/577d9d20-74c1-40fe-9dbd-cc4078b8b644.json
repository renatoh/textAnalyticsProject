Hoteliers are offering discounts or added value deals to entice European travellers to visit the Caribbean while the Americans stay closer to home after the terrorist attacks in the US. There are particularly good deals to destinations which rely heavily on the US market such as Jamaica and Barbados. Nigel Cleevely, UK managing director of the Caribbean all-inclusive specialist Sandals, said it was the first time it had discounted its holidays. Discounts of up to \u00a3600 per person are available to resorts in Jamaica, St Lucia and Barbados. The offers even cover the Christmas holiday period. David Kevan, product manager at Tropical Locations, said many hoteliers were offering room upgrades or free nights. 'Not many upmarket hotels are discounting but the added value deals offer great value for money,' he said. Caribtours said business was beginning to pick up from the UK as travellers perceive the destination to be safe. 'Compared to Florida, Dubai or the Far East people view the Caribbean as very much in the comfort zone. There are no obvious religious or political affiliations,' said Caribtours managing director Catherine Leech. \u00b7 Caribtours (020 7751 0660) is offering a 14-night stay at the Round Hill hotel in Jamaica for \u00a31,134 per person for stays up to mid-December, a saving of \u00a3595.
