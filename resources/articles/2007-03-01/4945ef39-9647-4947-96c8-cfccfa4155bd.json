This time, Sony has announced that, unlike the versions being sold in the US and Japan, in Europe its next-generation console will lack the Emotion Engine - the chip that powered the PlayStation 2. Which means that European gamers, unlike their American and Japanese counterparts, have no guarantee that the PS3 will play their favourite PS2 games. Sony says it will handle PS2 backwards compatibility through software emulation - as Microsoft does with the Xbox 360 - and that the list of playable PS2 titles will be frequently updated via new versions of the PS3's firmware, which will download automatically via the PlayStation Network. (Of course, that will require an internet connection.) It also has a site that will provide details of which PS2 games will be playable on the PS3, at faq.eu.playstation.com. Alas, even that sop has merely served to enrage committed PlayStation consumers still further - the site will remain blank until the PS3 launches on March 23. Alex Kwiatkowski at Datamonitor managed to find a positive spin in the removal of the Emotion Engine: \"It will have a positive impact on the PS3's long-term cost profile. By launching the PS3 in Europe with the new chassis, Sony has removed one of the barriers to future price reductions.\" Only one apparent flaw in that argument - Sony has manufactured more than 100m Emotion Engine chips, and economies of scale suggest that it can't possibly cost the company more than a few pence to manufacture. Custom component But Phil Harrison of Sony reveals that it may, after all, be a valid point: \"What has previously gone into PS3s on sale elsewhere in the world was a custom component, which we have now removed.\" Harrison won't be drawn on precise details of which PS2 games will be playable on the PS3 at launch, but says: \"We expect the list to encompass over 1,000 PlayStation 2 titles.\" So, will Sony concentrate on making the big PS2 titles - the Grand Theft Autos, Gods of War and Gran Turismos - compatible with the PS3? \"I can't give information on individual titles, but clearly, that would be our aim.\" Kwiatkowski reckons he has identified a shift in policy from Sony regarding the PS3. Sony has been criticised for not securing exclusivity on games such as Grand Theft Auto IV, whose predecessors have initially been available only on the PlayStation and PS2. GTA IV will come out simultaneously for the PS3 and Xbox 360. He says: \"It shows where Sony is putting a lot of its focus - on developing new titles in-house.\" Harrison confirms this shift in policy: \"That's absolutely the strategy. When we launched the PlayStation, there were no accompanying games developed by Sony. When we launched the PlayStation 2, there was one: Fantavision, which, beautiful game though it was, was no game on which to launch a platform. But the PS3 will launch with more exclusive, high-quality games from our studios than we've ever done before.\" Speculation is still rife that, as habitually occurs with console launches, the PlayStation 3 may not sell out when it launches. Big high street retailers such as Game, HMV and Virgin are still accepting pre-orders. To be fair, there have never been anything like the PS3's 220,000 units made available for a console launch, but unsold PS3s on March 23 would embarrass Sony. Says HMV: \"We are still taking pre-orders, in line with expectations. Because the PlayStation 3 is more expensive, that will slow it down in comparison with, say, the much cheaper Wii. But we're confident all stock taken in advance will be accounted for by pre-orders.\" Even if the PS3 does sell out at launch, there is a suspicion that subsequent sales will be sluggish compared with the Wii and the Xbox 360 - a suspicion reinforced by sales figures from Japan and the US. In Japan, between January 22 and 28, the PS3 was outsold by the all-but-moribund PS2 - 21,000 PS2s sold compared to 20,000 PS3s; meanwhile more than 80,000 Nintendo Wiis flew out of the shops. But there have been encouraging signs from the US that PS3 sales are picking up, although it is still thoroughly eclipsed by the Wii and Xbox 360. In January, Sony sold 243,554 PS3s in the US, compared to 436,000 Wiis and 294,000 Xbox 360s. The PS3 was, however, also outsold by the PS2, which shifted 299,352 units during the same period. The fact that a brand-new PS2 can now be picked up for \u00a350 would seem to highlight the importance of price to console consumers. UK retailers are bullish, however. Tricia Brennan of Game says: \"From our customers' reaction to date, we anticipate that demand for the PS3 will be high for many months to come post-launch. At the end of the day a console's success has always been driven by great games, and the PS3 has a huge range of titles available for launch.\" Sustaining momentum At Datamonitor, Kwiatkowski says: \"I think it will sell well. But it's about sustaining momentum by making attractive titles available during the first year of the PS3's life. It's not just about hardcore gamers making their choice, but finding broader appeal. Once the early adopters are out of the way, it's much harder to attract the hearts and minds of the second wave.\" One thing is for sure: it's a nerve-racking time at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. But if removing the Emotion Engine is a factor in paving the way for a PS3 price cut well in advance of the crucial Christmas market, then the entire games industry - bar Nintendo, Microsoft and everyone who paid \u00a3425 for a PS3 - will breathe an audible sigh of relief. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
