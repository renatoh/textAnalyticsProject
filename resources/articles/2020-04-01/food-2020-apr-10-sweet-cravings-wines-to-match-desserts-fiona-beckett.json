That includes the glorious Nigella, who still inexplicably manages to keep her Gina Lollobrigida-like figure. All I can deduce from that is we are all craving a little sweetness in our lives right now, and wine, of course, can tick that box, too. I may be wrong about this \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict anything reliably at the moment \u2013 but I don\u2019t anticipate there will be a run on sweet sherry or port any time soon (if there were, the producers would be ecstatic: they\u2019ve been trying to reverse falling sales for decades). At this time of year, I prefer lighter wines such as sauternes and other late-harvest sauvignon blancs, especially if any early-season strawberries have made it to the shelves. They also go with other fruits such as peaches and apricots, for which it is still early, or with almost any kind of classic apple or pear tart. They work less well with lemon-based desserts, which have the effect of throwing many sweet wines out of kilter, though late-harvest riesling \u2013 which matches lemon for acidity \u2013 is the exception that proves the rule. Meringue-based desserts such as pavlovas also need a light wine, rather than a dark, sticky one. Though you should turn to the latter if you\u2019re having something like a dense, squidgy, chocolate cake. That\u2019s if you haven\u2019t run through your chocolate stash, obviously. Then there are sweet or semi-sweet sparkling wines such as moscato d\u2019Asti and, you may be surprised to hear, \u201cextra-dry\u201d prosecco, which, perversely, can contain up to 17g of residual sugar ( left over after fermentation). By comparison, \u201cbrut\u201d proseccos have in the region of 10-12g sugar, which still makes them a bit sweeter than most champagnes and, to my mind, makes them go better with sweet foods, such as cake and biscuits, than savoury ones. And I can\u2019t help but feel that even if you don\u2019t normally touch the stuff, now is the moment for Bailey\u2019s or \u2013 better still \u2013 an own-label equivalent, not least because it will probably be half, if not a third, of the price. At the time of writing, you could still get Tesco\u2019s really rather delicious Salted Caramel Cream Liqueur (17%) for \u00a312, which in my book is better than any Easter egg. Keep it well away from the teens. Four sweet wines to enjoy over Easter Gavioli Moscato Spumante \u00a36.49 Lidl, 6.5%. Super-pretty bottle of an Asti-like sparkler that would go down hugely well with a milk chocolate Easter egg. Fleurs de Prairie Ros\u00e9 Sparkling \u00a38.99 Aldi, 12%. Sweeter than it looks - a blend of muscat and the very obscure vald\u00e8ze. Imagine pink prosecco. Booths Sauternes 2017 \u00a314, 13%. Really lovely, own-label sauternes that tastes of lemon meringue pie. The Kings Series \u2018A Sticky End\u2019 Noble Sauvignon Blanc 2017 \u00a312.96 Ocado, \u00a315.99 (on mix-six) Majestic, 10.5%. Intensely sweet, viscous and luscious \u2013 like sauternes on steroids.
