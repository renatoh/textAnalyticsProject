But if Gareth Batty suffered from such negative thinking, he would probably have given up the game years ago. Released by his native Yorkshire after a single season in 1997, the 24-year-old off-spinner then spent three summers in the shadow of Saqlain Mushtaq at Surrey, managing a grand total of four wickets in three first-class appearances. Now, however, after his first season at Worcester, he is looking forward to a winter at Rod Marsh's academy, and celebrated by taking five for 60 yesterday to make it exactly 50 championship wickets in a most productive year. With Kabir Ali, the skiddy swinger who will be going to Adelaide with him, taking his first-class tally to 70 with four for 72, Worcestershire fought back strongly after Derbyshire's openers had put on 103, with 26 boundaries before lunch. Luke Sutton hit 12 of them in a 63-ball half-century after he replaced the injured Michael Di Venuto as opener and captain. But once he fell to Kabir the rest of the batting folded, much as Derbyshire's own promotion challenge had last week. Jason Kerr and Kevin Dean offered overdue resistance in a ninth-wicket stand of 62, but Kabir returned to have Kerr caught behind for 54 and even on a pitch already offering spin to Batty as well as seam for the unlucky Matt Mason, Worcestershire are well placed to win. However even that may not be enough, as they also need Essex to beat Nottinghamshire at Chelmsford. Still, Batty has not given up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
