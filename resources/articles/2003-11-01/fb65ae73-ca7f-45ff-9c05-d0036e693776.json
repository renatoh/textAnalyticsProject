He will take over the position in August 2004 from opera singer Dame Janet Baker, who has been Chancellor since November 1991. The chancellor is the formal head of the university, whose official duties are to confer degrees on behalf of the University, and to chair the university's court. Beyond the formal and representational duties, the new chancellor will play a key role in the university's life, particularly through his chairmanship of the university's development Board. \"We will benefit greatly from Greg Dyke's insight, enthusiasm and personal commitment to the University of York,\" said Gordon Horsfield, the chair of the university's council. \"I am confident that Greg will make a great impact on York.\" \"York University took a risk when they enrolled me as a mature student with my one grade E at A level,\" Mr Dyke said. \"Going there changed my life, for which I've always been grateful. I hope by taking on this role I can help repay the debt I owe the university\" he added. Initially a newspaper journalist, Mr Dyke graduated from the University of York with a degree in politics in 1974. He has maintained a close relationship with the university and was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of the University in 1999 for his contribution to industry and public services. Mr Dyke became the director general of the BBC in January 2000. His term of office at York University will be five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
