A clean sweep of the day\u2019s events on grass was complete when Dermot Weld\u2019s Tarnawa landed the Turf. Then Authentic, the Kentucky Derby winner, brought down the curtain on the meeting with an authoritative success in the Classic under a copybook frontrunning ride by John Velazquez. The 4-1 chance was Bob Baffert\u2019s fourth winner of the race in the last seven years. O\u2019Brien\u2019s first ever victory in the Mile arrived in the most unlikely fashion, as the 73-1 outsider Order Of Australia finished strongly under Pierre-Charles Boudot to beat his stable companions Circus Maximus and Lope Y Fernandez. Order Of Australia was due to run in a race on Friday\u2019s undercard and only made it into the field for the Mile when William Haggas\u2019s One Master was scratched two days ago. Boudot, meanwhile, took over in the saddle after Christophe Soumillon tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d Boudot said. \u201cOrder Of Australia is a fast horse, the mile is very good for him and the good ground was perfect. He gave me a nice turn of foot when he got to the front. He\u2019s a tricky horse as he needs some help to concentrate.\u201d Glass Slippers was the first overseas runner to win the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint, after Tom Eaves plotted a winning path from a tricky pitch against the rail halfway down the stretch. \u201cKevin knows his horses like the back of his hand,\u201d Eaves said afterwards, \u201cand when we came off the track [after exercise] yesterday he said: \u2018We\u2019re in business.\u2019\u201d \u201cI talked to Ryan [Moore] before the race and he sort of went over the race with me and said, if he was going, he would go down inside and hope for a bit of luck.\u201d Boudot was also aboard Audarya, and again the beneficiary of remarkable good fortune as Ioritz Mendizabal, her regular jockey, also failed a Covid\u201119 test before he was due to travel to the US. \u201cIt is only by chance to get these rides,\u201d Boudot said, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry for Ioritz Mendizabal and Christophe Soumillon. \u201cAudarya was amazing, a real warrior. It\u2019s a difficult situation with Covid, but I was given two nice opportunities.\u201d Tarnawa\u2019s win in the Turf completed a memorable day at the races for European stables, as Colin Keane \u2013 also replacing Soumillon \u2013 brought Weld\u2019s filly with a perfectly timed run in the straight after turning in with only a couple of rivals behind him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
