A celebration of \"three manly games\" most valued by the descendants of Genghis Khan - horsemanship, wrestling and archery - it clearly has enough in common with Cheltenham to have tempted the Mongolian ambassador to come and compare the two yesterday. The entry of a horse sharing the name of his country's capital city helped coax his excellency Dalrain Davaasambuu to Gloucestershire, as did an invitation from Cheltenham management tickled by the entry of the Jessica Harrington-trained Ulaan Baatar in the Arkle, the second race of the Festival. Clad in full national dress, Davaasambuu struck an exotic figure both in the hospitality tents and among the tweed-clad hordes in the parade ring at Prestbury Park. Races in the Naadam are traditionally run over distances of 15 to 30 kilometres but Davaasambuu, a keen horseman as a young man in his home village of Davst, was plainly delighted to be sharing the atmosphere of Britain's premier jumps meeting, albeit over easier trips. \"If you grew up in the country as I did then it was imperative that you could handle a horse by the age of three years old,\" he said, ignoring the stares of passing punters uncertain what might have been tipped into their Guinness. \"Animal husbandry is a crucial part of surviving in rural areas and horses were the main means by which we herded animals. But every Mongolian has an interest in horses; they are a crucial part of our culture,\" he said. For Davaasambuu, who has been ambassador to the court of St James's for three years, this was a second taste of British racing. \"I went to Royal Ascot two years ago and I really enjoyed that. It is a marvellous spectacle and I am probably more fond of Flat racing than the jumps because it is not as dangerous, but this is a great event. \"As well as the racing it is clearly a great celebration of the bonds between Ireland and Great Britain expressed through horses and horsemanship. We are looking to promote our affinity with horses in Mongolia. We are famous for our skill and it is a big sport. Racing horses is a good way for people to make money at home.\" Unfortunately for the ambassador his attempts to make money from his opening day at the Festival were less successful. After placing his obligatory bet on Ulaan Baatar he attempted to ensure he backed a winner in the race regardless of how Barry Geraghty got on on board. \"I have backed every horse in the race to make sure I can collect some money,\" he said. Many punters will have felt just as desperate yesterday as they sought for winners. The Irish contingent had to wait until the third race for their first triumph but Hardy Eustace's success in the Champion Hurdle certainly appeared to buoy the spirits of a jolly Eddie Jordan and Kevin Moran as they tramped through the tented village. \"We're the lairy pair from Dublin,\" Jordan explained. The former England captain Mike Atherton was more restrained as he contemplated a three-day visit to the Festival outside the weighing room. \"I thought that four days would be too much of a good thing,\" he said. \"I have been a regular here for a few years but I have given up on ownership. It's too damn expensive.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
