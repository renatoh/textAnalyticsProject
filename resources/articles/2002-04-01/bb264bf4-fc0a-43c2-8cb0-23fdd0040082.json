With her hips thrust forward, her legs tremble in time to the quickening rhythm. But the sultry style never overshadows her smile. She is half Elvis, half Duracell bunny, and totally New York. Having fun is a quality that makes the Yeah Yeah Yeahs different from the other new-wave garage bands strutting their way out of the Big Apple. The trio's riotous tunes embrace grubbiness before suddenly revealing a debt to the Shangri-Las, and each one ends in unstoppable giggles from O. There is a feeling that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are simply filling time before getting the next round in. But playing for kicks - and breathing cliches - doesn't mean that the trio don't look and sound great. Guitarist Nick Zinner keeps his head down as his hands furiously create fluctuating punk rhythms, his experimental playing suggesting that bass-players may soon be extinct. Drummer Brian Chase looks like an accountant, his incongruous appearance and open-mouthed concentration disguising the force with which he plays. O more than compensates for what Chase lacks in charisma. Dressed in Debbie Harry chic, shouting with abandon, and adopting a girlie yelp reminiscent of Siouxsie Sioux, she moves robotically before bending like elastic, playfully interpreting each sassy lyric. Unfortunately she needs to because we can't hear her. The sound quality is terrible, the scuzzed-up, bluesy guitar of Miles Away drowned in screeching feedback. As O pulls off her shirt, leaving her skinny red tie to dangle, she is rendered almost silent by the bare-knuckle battle between the guitar and drums. The Kinks riff in Bang rises above the murky sound and shows the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' astute understanding of pop. Cold Light has a sleazy, urban undercurrent thanks to lots of bass drum and a hard and fast rhythm that falls to a drone, one mournful chord left hanging as O's inevitable giggles begin. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs may just be the cool kids who have the last laugh."}, "isHosted": false}}}
