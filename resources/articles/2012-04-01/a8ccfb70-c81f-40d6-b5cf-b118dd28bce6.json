Ahmed and Mohamed Abou Nasser, identical twins from the Gaza Strip, present cinema posters of action films that could never be made in a region that has not had a cinema since the 1980s. Similarly, the grandiose ponderings and special effects of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey have been recast by Larissa Sansour. Her midget plastic Palestinaut sculptures have here escaped from the film to explore the Cornerhouse. Cornerhouse, to 5 Jun Robert Clark Matthew Monahan, London A few years ago the Los Angelino sculptor Matthew Monahan was making a name for himself with sculptures that turned materials and cultural history inside out, including giant heads crafted from scrunched-up paper and figures tapping everything from Soviet statues to pagan folklore in beeswax, carbon paper and foam. Recently, he's turned away from these ephemeral media, creating bronzes recalling the Greek gods, gothic saints and modernist machine men. Yet Monahan's sculptures have a vulnerable quality. Created in fragments, held together with pins, and with their hollow insides visible, they suggest frail bodies and the traumatic clamour of the metal foundry. Modern Art, W1, to 12 May Skye Sherwin Tony Swain, Edinburgh While there might be nothing as redundant as yesterday's newspapers, artist Tony Swain invests them with an enduring afterlife. Newspaper images of vast landscapes or intimate interiors are collaged and worked into with a bold yet sensitive painterly application that lifts newsworthy scenery and topography into dreamlike realms of atmospheric resonance. Swain often imbues his cityscapes, seascapes and domestic interiors with something of the mythic import of 19th-century landscapes. All of which would seem like a lurid falsification of newsworthy fact if it weren't for the delicacy of Swain's infiltrations and transformations. Fruitmarket Gallery, Thu to 8 Jul RC Olivia Plender, Milton Keynes Olivia Plender's graphic novels, videos, performances and installations can seem a piebald affair. Their subjects include the hoary old cliche that says artists must be tortured, bohemian and male, obscure American spiritualists and English youth movements, and A Pilgrim's Progress, the suitably edifying text used to teach Victorian factory workers to read. Her first big survey takes a wry, questioning approach to all manner of educational models, from grassroots groups to major institutions and organisations. Open University initiatives, the BBC's arts programming, national libraries and Google rank among the models she takes to task. MK Gallery, Fri to 17 Jun SS Michael Dean, Leeds Concrete slabs lean against the walls on a specially fitted wall-to-wall wool carpet. Constructed on site, one abstract mass is so unwieldy it can never leave the gallery in one piece. Seeming to mimic the architectural spaces in which they are set, the sculptures have titles as heavy as their subjects: Education, Health, Home. The exhibition title is Government. Gallery invigilators sit about on the carpet and sporadically read aloud cryptic texts from the artist's notebooks, torn pages which visitors are invited to take away and peruse at their leisure. Even the handles on the gallery doors have been recast with slogans that contribute to this cryptic litany. Two read Yes. Two read No. The sculptures stand there like sentinels defying us to reach out to their forbidding authority, a temptation the artist is in fact eager to encourage: \"Touch with the eyes, and then \u2026 touch with the hand.\" Henry Moore Institute, to 17 Jun RC Willie Doherty, London The past three decades have seen Willie Doherty tackle the acid drip of violence slowly eroding lives and landscape in his native Northern Ireland with a bleak, poetic vision. This show of his lesser-known early photos, from 1985 to 1992, has all the dank gloom and burgeoning menace of his lauded films. The sky is always grey, above grim stone barricades resembling low-rise fortresses. Doherty's films use voiceover, describing scenes of conflict to conjure restless ghosts in the empty spaces before our eyes. In these nascent works, snipped bits of text \u2013 Last Bastion or Shifting Ground \u2013 narrate the photos like movie subtitles. Matt's Gallery, E3, Wed to 27 May SS Andy Warhol, Sheffield Who would have dreamed that Andy Warhol, the starstruck 60s pop artist, would go on to produce a late period that, like Goya and Rembrandt, offers poignant revelations of our common mortality. In these late self-portrait screen prints his trademark mask of deadpan composure is crowned by wigs and barely conceals a more vulnerable Warhol. Yet there is also a pathos here worthy of Buster Keaton, the deep sadness of one haunted by self-created personas that no longer seem to fit. Graves Art Gallery, to 1 Dec RC Stan Douglas, London Stan Douglas got into his role as a postwar press photographer to create his series Midcentury Studio, using actors and vintage as well as new technology to recreate overlooked moments from American history. As his shots of funfair foolery, housewives and criminal types suggest, film noir drama, carnival distractions and home-making dominated America's news in Douglas's chosen period of 1945-51. That all is not necessarily well, though, is suggested by the undertow of violence, as in the woman juggling knives on a suburban lawn.
