Riveting viewing it was not, but the Restoration Road Trip touches a nerve because it taps into nostalgia for a time when Britain cranked out engineers instead of hedge fund managers, and skilled workers built tangible end products instead of sitting in a call centre or behind a till. But it also raises a nagging disquiet about the radical transformation of the UK economy over the past 50 years. The collapse in manufacturing was by far the most striking trend in a fascinating chart from the Office for National Statistics last week showing changes since 1948, when industry made up more than 35% of output; today it is just above a tenth. It's not only fiftysomething men who hanker for the days when they could wield a rivet gun instead of a computer mouse. The change has brought other structural changes, such as yawning trade deficits, a hollowing-out of wages, and pitiful levels of capital investment. None of this appeared to matter terribly when the economy was rattling along at 2.5% a year, but even George Osborne has acknowledged that we are spending too much and making too little; and despite hints of a rebalancing in the latest GDP data, unless some of these trends are reversed, any recovery will be underwhelming at best. Professional economists' forecasts, hitched up to mathematical models that extrapolate past relationships into the future, tend to assume growth will eventually bounce back to some long-run average \u2013 the so-called trend rate. But as the thoughtful City analyst Andrew Smithers pointed out last week, in a note bluntly entitled \"The UK's Trend Growth is Seriously Overestimated\", economies' growth patterns can show sharp breaks, particularly when \u2013 as is true for the UK \u2013 they have endured a serious shock. He points out that Japan grew at a trend rate of more than 8% a year from 1955-1973, but that halved to 4% from 1973, after the oil crisis, plunged to just 1% from 1990 after the catastrophic crash, and has stayed there ever since. And the painful truth \u2013 not least for Labour \u2013 is that in the lead-up to the crisis, the economy was running on thin air. Investment by government and business combined has collapsed, not just over the past five years, but over a much longer period, from above 20% of GDP in 1990 to less than 15% today. That appeared not to matter in the early noughties, when machine tools seemed pass\u00e9, and bankers, management consultants and retailers were helping to generate rip-roaring growth with minimal capital investment. Yet that model was never going to be sustainable: UK exports tend to be mainly of goods, and the result of our dependence on services has been a persistent and worsening trade deficit. Osborne has rightly argued that we need to \"pay our way in the world\". Smithers argues that without a step-change in investment levels \u2013 and, as the coalition cracks down on immigration, without a fast-growing workforce \u2013 our long-run growth rate could be just 1%, perhaps even less. But boosting investment will take more than just waiting for companies to cheer up. Underinvestment has long been an achilles heel of the UK economy: partly the flipside of Britain's long, slow industrialisation, but also because of corporate short-termism. Costly investments in equipment, technology or training that might yield long-term benefits often mean a short-term hit to profitability, and to shares. Since executives' incentive plans tend to be linked to share prices, they often use any spare capital to buy back shares, giving the price a temporary, artificial boost, with no permanent benefit. Add in the fact that the banking sector is still hamstrung by bad debts from the boom years, and there's no hope of the investment revival without which an industrial renaissance is impossible. Labour has something to say about many of these problems. It would put shareholders on remuneration committees and employees on boards as a way of taming the bonus culture. It's looking at ways of rewarding firms that boost Britain's human capital with training. And it would set up a British investment bank to bypass the high-street banks. It could also do worse than pinch a few ideas from the LSE's excellent Growth Commission report, and promise to depoliticise national infrastructure decisions and beef up education for poorer kids. All of these would help to build a more solid, sustainable business model. But even if there is a coherent answer here to the question of what kind of economy we should build, Labour has two problems. First, it risks sounding either like a plea for a return to riveting, or like a ragbag of ideas hard to sum up in a slogan more convincing than the Tories' most likely line: \"Don't Let Labour Ruin It\". The second is that a fair chunk of the industrial neglect, deregulation and executive pay inflation that put the economy in trouble happened on Labour's watch. Somehow, Ed Miliband needs to capture the residual pride in industrial Britain summoned up by the Restoration Road Trip without sounding as irrelevant as a steam enthusiast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
