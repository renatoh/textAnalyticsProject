During the last weekend of December over 3,000 blocks of ice (each a 30cm cube) will be sliced out of the frozen local lake and trucked to the town of Eagle River. Once at their destination dozens of volunteers will heave the blocks into place, to construct an ice palace. The resulting 6-metre or so tall structure is built to a different design every year and illuminated with coloured lights, bringing tourists in their droves. The tradition, which dates back to the late 1920s, was started by a CH Hanke, who ran a business cutting and exporting ice. With the leftover ice from his harvest he started building palaces, for fun. Ice harvesting used to be big business. During the winter it was cut and stored in underground vaults. Come summer, the ice was used to preserve food, make iced drinks and ice cream, and even cool rooms. In Britain the growth of the catering industry (which wanted to offer their customers fresh fish, meat and iced desserts) meant that demand for ice exceeded supply by the 19th century, forcing restaurants to ship their ice in from as far afield as America and Norway. During the 20th century refrigeration killed the ice harvesting industry, and today it is only the construction of ice palaces, like the one at Eagle River, and ice hotels like the one in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi, Sweden, that keep the tradition alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
