We\u2019re going to win this race,\u201d Biden said from the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden stood on stage flanked by the California senator Kamala Harris, his running mate. \u201cJust look at what has happened since yesterday. Twenty-four hours [ago] we were behind in Georgia now we\u2019re ahead, and we\u2019re going to win that state. Twenty-four hours ago we were behind in Pennsylvania, and we are going to win Pennsylvania. Now we\u2019re ahead, but we\u2019re winning in Arizona, we\u2019re winning in Nevada. In fact our lead just doubled in Nevada.\u201d The former vice-president spoke as Americans anxiously await counting to conclude in a handful of states. Biden is ahead in the key swing states, with his lead widening as more votes get counted. On Friday, Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania, whose 20 electoral votes alone are enough to carry him over the threshold. He remained ahead in Nevada, and took the lead in Georgia, where the margin was so slim that the state declared there would be a recount. Trump has a narrow lead in North Carolina, and is expected to win the state of Alaska. Biden\u2019s lead in Arizona, which the Associated Press has called for Biden while other media organizations say it remains too close to call, has slightly shrunk. As Biden inches closer to the presidency, however, Trump reportedly was not ready to concede. After the lead slipped in Pennsylvania, the White House put out a statement insisting \u201cthis election is not over\u201d. \u201cJoe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!\u201d Trump tweeted. Those legal challenges from the Trump campaign and the larger Republican apparatus have slowed down the counting process. The campaign has taken legal action in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. But legal experts have noted that the lawsuits appear to be long shots and even if successful, they would not change the outcome of the race. The president and some allied groups have argued, paradoxically, that vote counting in some states should stop and in other places (where Trump might benefit) should continue. Biden is increasingly favored to emerge as the president-elect when all the counting is over however, and on Friday evening said he was confident of a victory. \u201cAnd look at the national numbers. We\u2019re going to win this race with a clear majority of the nation behind us,\u201d Biden said. The Biden campaign had originally planned to formally declare victory on Friday evening, appearing to believe news outlets would have called the race by then.The campaign had said vice-presidential nominee Harris would introduce Biden, longtime supporters and top Democrats, including senior Biden campaign staffers, the Democratic national committee chairman, Tom Perez, and Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, as well as longtime local supporters, had gathered at the Chase Center in anticipation. Biden himself, three days out from election night, was visibly upbeat, smiling through his short speech. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the first Democrat to win Arizona in 24 years,\u201d Biden said, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the first Democrat to win Georgia in 28 years, and we\u2019ve rebuilt the blue wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago. Michigan, Wisconsin, the heartland of this nation.\u201d Biden stressed patience. \u201cI know watching these tallies on TV moves very slowly and as slow as it goes it can be numbing,\u201d he said. And he looked ahead. \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for the final results I want people to know we\u2019re not waiting to get the work done,\u201d Biden said, adding that on Thursday, he and Harris met with experts on the economy and the coronavirus. \u201cWe have serious problems to deal with \u2013 from Covid to our economy to racial justice to the climate change,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any more time to waste on partisan warfare.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said many, many times, I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about the future of our nation,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign looked increasingly desperate as reports of internal finger-pointing grew and long-shot legal challenges became more unlikely. In the months leading up to 3 November, Trump had vowed to wage a serious legal defense if re-election appeared to be slipping away. But the campaign\u2019s response in recent days has been a clumsy set of lawsuits that in reality could only slow the count. Aides and staffers have told national news outlets that there was no set of competent leaders helming the legal defense strategy. At the Chase center, Biden ally and Delaware senator Chris Coons appeared unimpressed by the Trump campaign\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing in these lawsuits that have any chance of affecting the outcome\u201d , he told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve been really struck by the incoherence of the arguments made by the president. Principally, \u2018I want the counting to stop\u2019 at a moment when, if it stops, Joe Biden\u2019s the winner. He\u2019s arguing at the same time that there\u2019s some vast conspiracy that has somehow worked to his disadvantage when at the same moment in many states the Democratic challengers didn\u2019t win for Senate or Democratic challengers were unsuccessful in taking House seats.\u201d Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have offered only a half-hearted front of support for Trump. Some have echoed Trump\u2019s unfounded accusations that the election results are rife with fraud. But others have gently said that while every vote should be counted, both Trump and Biden should accept the ultimate results. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for the president to wait for that number to be apparent,\u201d said the Missouri senator Roy Blunt at the Capitol, according to Politico. \u201cI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for Vice-president Biden to accept the unofficial result and do whatever he thinks he should do. Part of the obligation of leadership is you should always have in your mind: \u2018How do I leave?\u2019\u201d Comments such as Blunts have lead even some Republican staffers to conclude privately that calls by Trump\u2019s allies to drop his efforts to fight the election results might have to end soon. On Friday evening, another challenge emerged for the Trump administration with reports that Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, had tested positive for Covid-19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
