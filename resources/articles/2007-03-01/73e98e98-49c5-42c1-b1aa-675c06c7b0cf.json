I'm not sure, as I write, whether they actually got to see Tony Blair, but I hope it works. It would make a good precedent. Maybe too good for anyone to authorise. It's hard to say no to motivated children. We've had a good run of it, but we've relied on leaving the classroom a lot. Thank heaven for cadavers. I love teaching ancient Egypt. Any excuse to visit the British Museum works for me, especially when the sun is pouring through that amazing glass roof. There's nothing like an away-day of blood and guts to get the children going. Riding on the back of the Egypt trip we went to listen to Sounds of the Orchestra at a local venue. Another beautiful spring day and the children, buoyed up on dead bodies, behaved like angels, as an octet taught them about wind and brass, and blew them away with Harry Potter and Star Wars, via EastEnders. On the walk back, they told us where they were going for Easter. A surprising number are going abroad. I just tried to book a last-minute flight to Anywhere. I got Nowhere because the prices are extortionate. As is always the case for teachers in school holidays. Here is the plan: get a petition from thousands of teachers and long-suffering partners, friends and families to subsidise the holiday price hikes. Next: Select a group of adorable, motivated children and send them to Downing Street. Finally: Find a strong arm of the media to sponsor us ... the world may become our oyster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
