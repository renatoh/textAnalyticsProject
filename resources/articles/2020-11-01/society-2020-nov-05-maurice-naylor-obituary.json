He joined the NHS in 1955, with his twin brother, Frank, who also served with distinction. Maurice joined the Manchester Regional Hospital Board, transferring to the Sheffield board in 1957, becoming its chief officer in 1963, and remaining in post when it became Trent in 1974. Maurice was involved with major initiatives there. The NHS reorganisation of 1974 brought together the family practitioner, community health, school health and ambulance services with the hospital services for the first time and also brought the teaching hospitals into the mainstream of the NHS. Two new medical schools were established in Maurice\u2019s time at Trent, Nottingham in 1970, and Leicester in 1975. The Resource Allocation Working Party established by Barbara Castle in 1975 was the first serious attempt to end the inequality in the distribution of resources between the regions in England. Maurice was a powerful advocate for his region, one of the poorest. Although the redistribution took many years it was well under way by the time he retired in 1981. Maurice also led the planning and development of the district general hospitals in the region, including Doncaster, Rotherham, Barnsley, Nottingham, Derby and Leicester. After his retirement he became the first director of the National Association of Health Authorities, from 1981-84. He was greatly admired for his wisdom, calmness under pressure and a steadfast belief in the NHS. He was an exemplar of the public service ethic, working hard and expecting the same of others, with absolute integrity and fairness. He was a match for ministers and civil servants with his quiet and authoritative style. Maurice was serious and inspiring in his work and privately showed great kindness. Born in Flixton, near Manchester, he was one of three children of Thomas Naylor, an accountant with Manchester city council, and his wife, Agnes (nee Porter), a teacher. After leaving St Joseph\u2019s College, Market Drayton, in 1936 Maurice followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to work for the council, returning to this work after second world war service with the Royal Artillery. He was captured at the fall of Singapore in 1942 and later described the \u201coverwork, starvation, neglect and brutality\u201d he experienced as a prisoner of the Japanese. He was active in Veterans Associations and, at the age of 94, addressed the VJ Day anniversary service at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in London, which was attended by the Queen. Maurice\u2019s wife, Maureen (nee Walsh), whom he married in 1948, died in 2016. His brother, Frank, and sister, Agnes, also predeceased him. He is survived by his children, Anne, Mike and Liz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
