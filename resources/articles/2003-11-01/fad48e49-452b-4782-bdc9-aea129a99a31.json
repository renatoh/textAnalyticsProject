Park at the base and climb the 562 steps, easier than it sounds! The rock formations at Ayo and Casibari are visually interesting, offer good walking/scrambling and I saw many blue tailed lizards and wild parrots there. Quiet beaches include Arashi - no facilities but an idyllic stretch of sand and never crowded and my own favourite; Boca Catalina - small but perfectly formed. The snorkelling here is magical and the soft white sands, even in high season, are usually deserted. Paul Griffin \u00b7 Aruba is really too small to have anywhere 'off the beaten track', but some parts of the island are more interesting than others. Mass tourism was developed deliberately in the 1980s to pay off debts and the coastal strip on the north-west side of the island with the best beaches is now wall-to-wall hotels. To get away from it all, head for the east coast, where there are a few good sandy beaches, but generally the sea is too rough and dangerous for swimming and there is no accommodation. Dos Playa and Andicouri are popular with body surfers and nesting turtles, while at Boca Prins there are sand dunes. Boca Grandi, on the east coast of the south tip, has good snorkelling and swimming, being protected by a reef, but it also\u00e6receives tours coming here to see the huge elkhorn coral. Sarah Cameron Caribbean Islands Handbook (Footprint, 2003) \u00b7 Is there anywhere worth visiting? In a word, no. However Aruba is not all resort hotels and shopping malls. The north side of the island, the wilder side, is very barren and wind beaten. Just look at the trees. The main access point half-way along the coast to Natural Bridge is impressive but has its share of tourist coaches. The quad bikes take you to more barren bits which have even less to see. Better accept Aruba for what it is - nice beaches, good but expensive food and good diving. There is no natural fresh water in Aruba and the bird resort at Bubali (back of Palm Beach by the windmill) is a very pleasant place, little used and great for sunrise and sunsets. A drive to San Nicholas gives a great taste of seedy bars by an oil refinery. But if you give up and want to feel like a film star then stay at the Renaissance resort in Oranjestadt and go to their private island (or buy a day ticket) for a wonderful coral reef island with bird life, a beautiful lagoon and a relaxing time.
