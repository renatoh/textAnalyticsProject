Nicholas Hytner now seeks to repeat the process with an immersive Dream that has half the audience standing and that looks both to the past and the future. Its spectacular use of aerial acrobatics evokes memories of Peter Brook\u2019s legendary 1970 production, while its reassignment of much of the text is in line with our faith in sexual liberation. I loved the fiesta-like atmosphere while questioning the textual transpositions. The evening begins with the prolonged imprisonment of Hippolyta \u2013 played by Gwendoline Christie of Game of Thrones fame \u2013 in a glass cage. She is clearly the captive bride of Oliver Chris\u2019s autocratic Theseus: the evening\u2019s most moving moment is the look of wounded complicity Christie shares with Isis Hainsworth\u2019s similarly threatened Hermia. As is common, Hippolyta and Theseus then mutate into the fairy queen and king, but Titania speaks lines normally assigned to Oberon while Oberon speaks hers. It is a startling reversal that has loss as well as gain. The bonus is that it heightens the comedy to see Oberon falling head over heels for an ass: the sight of Chris lasciviously nibbling the erect ears of the translated Bottom is one I shan\u2019t soon forget. The payoff comes when, returning to Theseus, Chris is forced to soften his sexual authoritarianism by recalling his dalliance as Oberon with a male donkey. But, while the role reversal gives Titania/Hippolyta unusual agency, it has perverse side-effects. The great speech in which the fairy queen laments the death of her votaress sounds odd coming from a man. I\u2019d also argue that you don\u2019t need to fiddle with the text for the play to offer a critique of male power hunger. Hytner\u2019s purpose, I guess, is to question the idea of a rigid, binary sexuality. This leads him, mistakenly I believe, to show Lysander and Demetrius, as well as Hermia and Helena, snogging each other in the midst of what is meant to be a fierce fight in the forest. But, for all its excesses, the production is staged with immense physical bravura and is great fun. Hammed Animashaun is a suitably overweening Bottom fascinated to be treated as the fairy king\u2019s toy boy while protesting: \u201cNot now. I\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d He also leads a mixed-gender group of mechanicals who perform the Pyramus and Thisbe interlude in tracksuits as if they were a mime ensemble. David Moorst is also an extraordinary high-wire Puck interacting with the audience as freely as with the immortals. A wealth of invention has gone into the show. Bunny Christie\u2019s design is full of airborne beds and rising greensward, although, unforgivably, the manoeuvring of the set distracts from Puck\u2019s final speech. Arlene Phillips as movement director and Lennin Nelson-McClure as circus captain create some eye-catching gymnastics. We even get a full-throated rendering of Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Bonkers. That song, which proclaims \u201cMan, I\u2019m just livin\u2019 my life\u201d, might be said to epitomise a pleasantly bonkers show that celebrates a freewheeling pan-sexuality. But, while Hytner\u2019s production is like a delirious party, I would have enjoyed it still more if it released the microscopic beauties of Shakespeare\u2019s text as well as the play\u2019s comic energy. \u2022 At the Bridge theatre, London, until 31 August. To be broadcast on NT Live on 17 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
