But the move immediately prompted claims by family doctors that it could lead to them being unfairly blamed for problems beyond their control. The threat to close any of England's 8,000 GP practices judged to be giving patients substandard care is the ultimate sanction included in the Care Quality Commisison's (CQC) decision to extend the \"special measures\" regime for failing hospitals to general practice. From October, any surgery which the CQC deems to be \"inadequate\" will be given up to six months, but in some cases only a few weeks, to draw up and implement an action plan of improvements. Any that fail to address concerns quickly enough will be put into \"special measures\", under which NHS England, which funds general practice, will take charge of overseeing the turnaround, ordering the changes deemed necessary, such as hiring more staff or extending the hours in which the surgery is open. If, after a further period of no more than six months, problems are still evident, the CQC will cancel the practice's registration, which means it will have to close. Professor Steve Field, the CQC's chief inspector of primary care, said that a surgery could be rated as inadequate if a CQC inspection or other evidence revealed \"serious failings\", such as a failure to manage its medicines properly or ensure good hygiene or undertake staff criminal records checks. \"If a GP practice is rated inadequate that will be the starting gun to force it to improve fast\", said Field, a former chair of the Royal College of GPs. While most surgeries provide high quality care, a small minority do not, said Field. Problems at just one surgery could potentially affect thousands, or even tens of thousands, of patients, if it had a large number of GPs, he added. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) GP committee, said that all patients should receive excellent care from their GP practice and that most do. However, he warned that \"it is important not to create a counterproductive blame culture based on isolated examples that would wrongly damage patient trust in wider GP services.\" Problems at a surgery may be because of underfunding, difficulty in recruiting staff or the poor state of the premises, he added. \"The last thing we want is for GP practices to close when what patients need is high quality, local services.\" Dr David Wrigley, a Lancashire GP who is also on the BMA's ruling council, said: \"It's inevitable that there are pockets of below average standards of care across the country, but I think this is all part of the government's 'trash the NHS' agenda and the CQC are doing the bidding for them.\" Recent CQC inspections have found that problems occur most often at small surgeries, which have just one or two doctors. For example, the Granville Road surgery in Southfields, London, run by Dr Mujb ul Haq Khan, was found not to pose a threat to patients' safety and welfare because emergency medication and oxygen on site had expired, risks of infection had not been tackled and quality of service was not being monitored. The CQC's crackdown will also see it use patient complaints and information gathered by local bodies such as HealthWatch and whistleblowers in deciding which surgeries are putting patients at risk. Some practice nurses and practice managers already ring the CQC's hotline to raise concerns about their surgery, Field said. NHS England said it would make arrangements for patients affected by any closures to start being treated at other nearby practices or by a new GP taking over the running of the surgery that has fallen foul of the regulator."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
