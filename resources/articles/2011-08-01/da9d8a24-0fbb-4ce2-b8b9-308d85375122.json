This track is a relentlessly angular affair with spiky BVs, loud drums and ambiguous oriental noises. Whether it's about love, lust or displaced friendships I don't quite know, but what I do know is it's well written and sung with genuine heart. I imagine Tom to be like a postmodernist version of Willy Wonka. With a thousand well-educated Oompa-Loompas in American Apparel, running around a massive aerodrome made of ice, helping him to restring his electric harp and filling his pots with multicoloured ink. The thin culture bunnies of east London will love it and so do I. Elbow Lippy Kids (Fiction) On the best-titled track of the week, Guy Harvey's reassuring tones reminisce, I guess, about childhood. As far as I can decipher the narrative (and I am enjoying it), he seems to be talking about the currency of the streets back in the day: \"Lippy kids on the corner again/ Lippy kids settling like crows/ I never perfected that simian stroll but the cigarette sense/ It was everything then.\" A \"simian stroll\", I can only imagine, means to walk like a monkey/ape, which conjures up northern malcontents trading snouts on pokey back streets full of naive hope. Forgive me If I got that wrong. Britney Spears I Wanna Go (Jive) Imagine If C3PO really did exist and, post-Star Wars, dated an abusive Somalian warlord who left him penniless and in deep cognitive therapy. Imagine that in therapy he discovered the source of all his problems was the fact he'd been built with a sensual chip which had no way of being satisfied, as he had no penis or lips. Imagine then, as an exercise in emotional relief, he was encouraged to make music and help some of his equally turbulent celebrity friends, whom he'd mostly met in an Arkansas dry-out clinic, to make their music. Imagine his first attempt at co-producing a professional track (I Wanna Go) was with his new bessy, Britney Spears, who is also confused, scared and hugely misguided. J Pearl Feat Shayne Ward Must Be A Reason Why (Simply Delicious) Music for evil stumpy Russian men to dance to while wearing budgie smugglers and pretending they're being fellated. J Pearl's singing makes Jordan sound like Roberta Flack. Personally, it makes me feel like I'm on very strong antibiotics and stuck in the world's largest butchers. Nero Promises (MTA) So discomfort-inducing it reminds me of a recent nightmare I had where my mother was trying to poison me with her own breast milk.
