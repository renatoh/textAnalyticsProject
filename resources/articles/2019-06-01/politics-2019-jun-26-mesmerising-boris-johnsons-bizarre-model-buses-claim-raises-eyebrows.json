Speaking on Talk Radio on Tuesday, the frontrunner to replace Theresa May was asked by the interviewer, Ross Kempsell, what he did to relax. Johnson replied: \u201cI like to paint. Or I make things. I have a thing where I make models of buses. What I make is, I get old, I don\u2019t know, wooden crates, and I paint them. It\u2019s a box that\u2019s been used to contain two wine bottles, right, and it will have a dividing thing. And I turn it into a bus. \u201cSo I put passengers \u2013 I paint the passengers enjoying themselves on a wonderful bus \u2013 low carbon, of the kind that we brought to the streets of London, reducing C02, reducing nitrous oxide, reducing pollution.\u201d Some people on social media put forward the theory that Johnson\u2019s claims might not be entirely based in truth. Others suggested the story was a sign of Johnson\u2019s feeling of entitlement, a sense that he feels he can say whatever he wants, no matter how absurd or questionable and get away with it. One wondered: is Johnson\u2019s \u201cmost basic faculty deserting him?\u201d Several people speculated as to whether campaign internswere now frantically building model buses in case they were asked to produce proof of Johnson\u2019s hobby. \u201cBoris and his girlfriend have been up all night painting bus models and then knocking them around a bit to make them look old,\u201d said Australian journalist Matt Bevan. As historian and author Greg Jenner noted, this is not the first time Johnson\u2019s name has been linked to bus art. A sketch of a London bus by Boris Johnson raised \u00a31,000 in a charity auction earlier this year. While Johnson was trying to draw a connection between his hobby and the buses he introduced to London during his tenure as mayor, others found a stronger link with another sort of bus: those painted with Brexit campaign slogans, which Johnson was pictured with so often during the lead-up to the EU referendum. BBC presenter Simon McCoy speaking after the clip was broadcast, quipped: \u201cWonder what he writes on the side of it\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
