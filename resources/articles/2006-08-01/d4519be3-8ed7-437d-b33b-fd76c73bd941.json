This misrepresents the nature of the protagonists and the issues at stake. The most active \"self-appointed guardians\" are the Swedish state-owned monopoly Vin &amp; Sprit, and the Finnish state-owned monopoly Altia - two of the largest spirits producers in the world. They are demanding a restrictive definition of \"vodka\" that would exclude not only the products of multinationals, but also those of many small producers around Europe who use materials other than cereals or potatoes. This can't be justified by reference to the protection of consumers or tradition. Research shows that most consumers do not know what vodka is made from - and those who know do not care. Even in Sweden and Poland, only 1% of vodka drinkers say that the raw materials are relevant to their choice of vodka. Most people simply \"knock the stuff back without a moment's thought\". Nor are the Baltic producers guarding an established tradition. Neither Vin &amp; Sprit nor Altia produced spirits under the name \"vodka\" until the 1970s, when they began using the name on their traditional products brannvin and viina for sale in export markets. But the fact that these products could be called vodka does not mean that its definition should now be limited by reference to them. There is no history of restricting raw materials in these countries. Indeed, Vin &amp; Sprit used to use \"sulphite waste liquor\" (a waste product of the paper industry). Thankfully this is no longer allowed, but Vin &amp; Sprit still uses beet molasses to produce brannvin - the product on which it founds its claim to a \"tradition\". In Poland, too, vodka has been produced from raw materials other than cereals and potatoes. Records show Polish producers using sugar beets and rutabagas (swedes), and more recently they attempted to introduce vodka made from apples. In the circumstances, for the Polish MEP Boguslaw Sonik to describe our wish to retain the status quo and the right to use any agricultural raw material as \"hypocrisy\" looks like the pot calling the kettle black. The European Vodka Alliance supports countries regulating the production of their traditional products such as brannvin or viina - and to translate these, if they wish, as \"Swedish vodka\" or \"Finnish vodka\". But the Baltic states, in seeking to restrict the generic term \"vodka\", are not defending their traditions but attempting to eliminate competition from vodka producers elsewhere in Europe. The definitive characteristic of vodka is that it has been distilled - and often filtered through charcoal - to ensure that impurities from the raw materials have been removed. This being so, restricting raw materials would not affect the finished product's quality: it would be pure protectionism. To characterise those seeking the restriction as \"vodka purists\" is pure nonsense. \u00b7 Chris Scott-Wilson is counsel to the European Vodka Alliance chrissw@tswp.com \u00b7 If you wish to respond, at greater length than in a letter, to an article in which you have featured either directly or indirectly, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
