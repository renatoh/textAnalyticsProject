If it's legal, ethical, and done in good faith, I'm prepared to consider it.\" Bernard Hogan-Howe made the comments in an internal video mission statement to his force, in which he promised to cut crime and slash costs with \"humility, transparency and integrity\". Hogan-Howe, who beat Stephen House, Sir Hugh Orde and former acting commissioner Tim Godwin to the job on Monday, said that during the selection process \u2013 which included rounds of interviews with the Home Office and Metropolitan Police Authority \u2013 he made a promise that he wanted to make the Met \"the best police service in the UK, and \u2026 in the world.\" He set out three aims: \"To cut crime, cut costs, and continue to develop the culture of the organisation \u2013 our diversity and the way we relate to each other \u2013 and to do all that based on simple but important values of humility, transparency and integrity.\" The former chief of Merseyside police, talked of wanting to do \"total policing \u2026 Some of you might recognise that phrase from my time in Merseyside\" he said, \"For those of you that don't, what I'm talking about is a war on crime.\" But as well as wanting to make the Met a force \"that criminals will fear\", he said he also wanted to focus on crime prevention and on caring for the victims of crime. Hogan-Howe is taking over the \u00a3260,000-a-year post after his predecessor, Sir Paul Stephenson, resigned over the phone-hacking scandal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
