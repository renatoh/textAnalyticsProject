With the final straight in sight only the most pessimistic of Albion fans would bet against them returning to the Premier League they left last season, more likely than not alongside their fellow fallen idols Newcastle United. In the words of the manager, Roberto Di Matteo: \"Now we have our destiny in our own hands.\" The Swansea manager, Paulo Souza, had described his players as being \"tired both physically and mentally\" after Saturday's goalless draw with Sheffield Wednesday. That did not stop them from dominating possession during the early stages, the catch being that once again there was no end result to show for it. Employing their regular but cautious 4-5-1 formation it is easy to see why the Welsh side are the Championship's lowest scorers, failing to hit the target in nine home games so far this campaign. The fact that City's right-back Angel Rangel recorded their only shot on target of the first half says it all, though Nathan Dyer did strike an upright in the 22nd minute with a mis-hit cross. The flip side to Swansea's season is that defensively they have come to resemble the dictionary definition of mean, running up their 21st clean sheet in the league on Saturday. West Bromwich showed little inclination to test City's back four, Di Matteo also employing a 4-5-1 formation in an attempt to stifle rather than stretch the home side. Albion's goal tally on the road this season exceeds that of Swansea's total home and away but on this occasion the Italian initially appeared content to contain. The visitors started to show more adventure after the break, Luke Moore's powerful drive from 10 yards bringing a good block from Dorus de Vries at his near post. That was enough to stir Swansea from their final-third coma and, as Alan Tate and Dyer at last dirtied Scott Carson's jersey with efforts, news of Nottingham Forest's travails at Barnsley stirred emotions further in the stands among both sets of supporters. It was Albion who made the breakthrough with 11 minutes remaining. The substitute Giles Barnes pushed the ball past Rangel inside the Swansea area and went to ground under the defender's challenge. Roger East immediately pointed to the spot to the fury of three sides of the Liberty Stadium who believed as one that Barnes had milked the situation. After a prolonged delay which saw Shefki Kuqi booked for his protests, Graham Dorrans drilled the ball high into the net. That knocked the stuffing out of Swansea, who seemed to sense that the game was up. In the final minute of normal time Ishmael Miller broke through City's offside trap before rounding De Vries to make the game safe with a second goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
