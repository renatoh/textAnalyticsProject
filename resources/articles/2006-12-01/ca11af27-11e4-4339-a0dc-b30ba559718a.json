Most pertinent for West Ham's fans was whether their left-back Paul Konchesky should have been dismissed for a sliding challenge on Fulham winger Wayne Routledge in the 85th minute of a blood-and-thunder game. Chris Coleman, the Fulham manager, thought referee Chris Foy was correct, while, naturally, his opposite number Alan Curbishley disagreed and made it clear that West Ham will make a formal appeal, which should allow Konchesky to play against Portsmouth on Boxing Day. Curbishley admitted he was still asking questions of his new charges, after getting his reign off to a winning start with a much-needed victory over Manchester United last week. They did not manage their first win of the season outside Upton Park and even extended their run without an away goal in the Premiership to more than 13 hours, but they did curtail an appalling run of 10 successive away defeats and Curbishley was pleased with the way his players performed. 'The performance deserved more than a point, but we kept a clean sheet away from home and could even have taken all three points,' he said. 'You need to nick a three-pointer when you are in our position, but it did not happen for us. Do results breed confidence or confidence breed results? Either way we need to get both of them.' Warming to his theme, he added: 'The players have been asked some tough questions, such as what do you do when you have lost four games on the spin? Make sure you don't lose the fifth, that's the answer.' West Ham certainly could have won it, hitting the woodwork twice, but defeat would have been harsh on a Fulham side missing 10 players through injuries, the most recent of which is the most bizarre. Zat Knight turned up at training with a broken jaw on Thursday after 'fooling around' with his brother the day before. 'X-rays showed he's got two breaks in his jaw and he could be out for two months, possibly more,' Coleman said. 'It's a freak accident - that's what he said and we believe him. But it has come at a bad time for us, as we are down to the bare bones.' Coleman was heartened, however, by the battling spirit his side showed in the first of a run of six successive London derbies in the League. Moritz Volz was a revelation as a makeshift midfielder and Michael Brown was his usual tenacious self, although at times the biting challenges from both teams threatened to spill over into something more. Coleman, no shrinking violet himself as a player, loved it. 'It was a good London derby with some good niggly battles and I really enjoyed it,' he admitted. West Ham went closest to scoring when Matthew Etherington's looping header evaded goalkeeper Antti Niemi but scraped the crossbar before being cleared off the line by Tomasz Radzinski in the 16th minute, and Marlon Harewood volleyed against the post from close range 20 minutes later. Niemi beat away shots from Nigel Reo-Coker and substitute Yossi Benayoun, but his opposite number Robert Green was the busier, saving well from Brian McBride's fierce free-kick and powerful header and then smothering an attempt from Volz when the German ran in on goal. So no goals, a point each and both managers pleased with their sides' efforts. But will that be enough to keep them out of the danger zone? That is the big question. Man of the match: Moritz Volz Not much to choose between him and his midfield partner Michael Brown, but Volz was playing out of position and always looked in control. May describe himself as a humourless Westphalian on his website, but had every reason to smile after a terrific game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
