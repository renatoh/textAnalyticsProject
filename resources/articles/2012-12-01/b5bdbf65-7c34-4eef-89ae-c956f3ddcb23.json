However, neither EDF nor I realised it had failed to set up the debits properly until two months ago, and it now reckons I owe it \u00a31,514. Can the company bill me for 12 months like that when the direct debit failure was its responsibility? CB, Bletchley, Bedfordshire I'm sorry to tell you that you can be billed up to six years after a transaction. What is extraordinary about this is that EDF didn't notice it wasn't getting its dues from you and you, as you admit, were lax in not checking your bank statements more carefully. The company has now decided to cancel all the bills from before last November and to pay \u00a3100 in goodwill, so you now owe \u00a3746.74, which you can pay in monthly instalments over two years. So, stressful as the episode was, the error has ended up in your favour.
