Her ideas about Oxbridge go back to Evelyn Waugh; her ideas about the French intellectuals of the late 60s share the shallowest complacencies of an age in which European leftwingers praised Mao's cultural revolution. Not for nothing did Raymond Tallis claim in his brilliant expose of post-structuralist literary theory, Not Saussure, that when the emperor was after new clothes, he tended to shop in Paris. Steve Thorn Colyton, Devon I had to read Dr Seaton's letter several times to be sure she was not being ironical when invoking Foucault, Derrida, Baudrillard and Lacan as evidence that \"France has been a major cultural force in modern Europe\". Anyone who has engaged seriously with these writers will have discovered they are masters of the art of gibberish. Their bituminous prose, laden with technical terms they do not understand, conceals incoherence, philosophical errors that would put a freshman to shame, factual inaccuracy and scholarship of unbelievable sloppiness. Their reputation has survived because they are judged by those who cannot tell Stork from butter. Few historians take Foucault's periodisations seriously; Derrida's lucubrations on language impress few linguists; Lacanian psychoanalysis and his theories of child development are widely, and justly, regarded as evidence-free nonsense. And yet the views of these writers are imposed as gospel truth on hundreds of thousands of humanities students whose academic progress depends on being able to regurgitate ideas that are in many cases actually impossible to think. In France, however, the caravan has moved on and there are some major thinkers who are indeed contributing to France's deserved reputation as \"a major cultural force in modern Europe\". France has recovered from charlatans who are still revered outside their native land. Prof Raymond Tallis Stickport, Cheshire I must contend Dr Seaton's claim, for the discipline of psychology at least, that \"nothing produced in Britain comes even close\" to the contributions of French thought. Any analysis of the leading international journals would reveal this claim as ill-informed prejudice. I have no wish to indulge in an exchange of national stereotypes, hence I point out that part of the explanation for the weaker impact of French ideas in psychology at least is the culture of publishing in French-language internal reports, rather than English-language papers in peer-reviewed journals. Here we Brits have a clear linguistic advantage. None the less, British-based psychology can be justifiably proud of its high reputation for training and research. This is one of the reasons that so many more students from the continent of Europe wish to come and study in Britain, with its quality of teaching and student supervision, rather than in France, where they are just anonymous faces in over-filled lecture halls. French universities better than British, let alone the coddling of Oxbridge students taught in tutorial groups? As John McEnroe might say: \"Vous ne pouvez pas etre serieux!\" Prof Miles Hewstone University of Oxford We Americans may know that France has \"everything else after Jazz, Whitman and Faulkner\". But I always considered Shakespeare and Co (no, not the shop) were British. Just try and discuss theoretical advances in any French university today. If they're open. Anthony Axon Freckenham, Suffolk Dr Seaton is no doubt correct about the excellence of French philosophical and cultural thought in the 20th century. But outside the universities nobody gives a damn. Compare this with France's greatest philosopher, Rousseau. He expressed his radical and revolutionary ideas in a simple, lucid, passionate prose which any reasonably well-educated contemporary could understand. His political, economic and educational ideas transformed the world. Messrs Derrida, Baudrillard, Lacan and others settle in their comfortably tenured magisterial chairs and are paid whether or not they make their ideas understood to l'homme moyen sensuel. So to most of us, the philosophical hierarchy within the universities in France, America and England is a supreme irrelevance. Unlike Rousseau. George Manuell Tamworth, Staffs It is an irony that Dr Seaton's views are widely held in American academia about Harvard. Dynamic and original thought now is associated with other non-Ivy private (Stanford, Duke, NYU, Chicago) and state universities (Michigan, Minnesota, California) and Harvard is seen as the bastion of the orthodoxy and old school ties that she decries. Subir Sinha London James Syme, in his courteously restrained response to my rather rude tirade about French cultural superiority, noting that Cambridge alone outdoes France in Nobel science prizes, suggests a point the edited version of my letter did not. There is a reason why it is the sciences - and not difficult modernist fiction or books about the philosophy of freedom - which can still flourish in totalitarian societies. Freedom of thought is more difficult to quantify empirically, but it is no less important, as every dictator who bans books knows well. French thought, at its best, gives us the tools to resist our own dehumanisation (if you doubt this, read all of Diderot's novels or any of Rousseau). The recent student protests are an example of that passion, however convoluted. All my criticisms of Britain should really go double for the US (and probably even for hallowed Harvard).
