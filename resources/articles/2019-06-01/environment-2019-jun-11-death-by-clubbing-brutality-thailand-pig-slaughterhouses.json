Undercover images taken in the central Thailand abattoir and shared with the Guardian also show workers stunning the animals on their eyes with what appear to be homemade stunning machines, contrary to equipment recommendations. Although Thailand does have specific guidelines for pig slaughterhouses \u2013 which require that the animals be killed \u201cwithout suffering\u201d \u2013 humane slaughter practices in the Buddhist country\u2019s small- and medium-sized abattoirs are virtually non-existent, say campaigners. Pigs are transported in caged trucks that are often overcrowded and offer no protection from the elements \u201cThe Thai public, in general, is not aware of the need for humane killing practices,\u201d said local animal rights activist Wadchara Pumpradit. \u201cFarm animals are born to be killed for food and people do not consider their needs or their right to be respected.\u201d While the Thai government runs training courses on humane slaughter, regulations are not enforced and smaller-scale producers and processors are largely unmonitored, added Pumpradit. \u201cThe current monitoring system regarding humane slaughter needs to be strengthened. How can we be sure licensed slaughterhouses are complying with the law when they are not directly monitored?\u201d he asked. \u201cElectric prods, and long steel nails held clasped in a fist, protruding between fingers, were used to move pigs along,\u201d said photojournalist Jo-Anne McArthur Pork is a staple ingredient in Thai recipes, from the average household kitchen to the nation\u2019s beloved street stalls. Roughly 18 million pigs are raised a year by various-sized producers, ranging from an estimated 200,000 smallholders to multinational giants, in an industry worth roughly $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn). In a slaughterhouse in central Thailand where 500 pigs are killed every day, photojournalist Jo-Anne McArthur recently documented the animals arriving on pickup trucks. She then followed the slaughter process as they were clubbed with a large wooden bat, slit open with a knife, allowed to bleed out, and finally dragged into a vat of boiling water. From start to finish, the slaughterhouse\u2019s poor practices are representative of operations in small- and medium-sized abattoirs across the region, said global farm animal adviser Kate Blaszak of the international charity World Animal Protection (WAP). \u201cCaged transport is a common mode of transport in south-east Asia. Usually the animals arrive cramped, dehydrated, exhausted and severely sunburnt if they\u2019ve been transported during the day, often across borders,\u201d said Blaszak. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got poor unloading and handling of the animals: falling and slipping pigs, or pigs which are dropped, dragged, beaten and kicked. Clubbing is a manual attempt to stun an animal \u2013 to render it unconscious before killing by bleeding by knife. But clubbing is very ineffective in pigs. \u201cThe simple speed of manual clubbing cannot meet the necessary energy for an effective stun. Clubbing just beats, bruises and abuses animals and is ineffective. \u201cElectrical stunning is sometimes done and usually with completely unregulated stunning equipment, which is sometimes homemade. It\u2019s consistently wrongly applied and completely ineffective as it doesn\u2019t even span the brain. It\u2019s just cruel electric shock and pain. Good practical training and enforcement can overcome all these issues, to the benefit of all involved.\u201d The slaughterhouse did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment. McArthur\u2019s photos underline the need for slaughter training across the region, where inhumane practices are \u201cthe routine\u201d in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, said Blaszak. Undercover footage of an open-air slaughterhouse in Phnom Penh, where pigs are violently clubbed in full view of surrounding apartment blocks, has sparked calls from activists for the government to implement stricter animal welfare laws. \u201cAcross south-east Asia, humane slaughter standards and enforcement are needed for all species slaughtered, including pigs, poultry, cattle and buffalo, as well as geese and ducks,\u201d said Blaszak. \u201cHowever, from my experience, there is little routine enforcement or even regulation for animal welfare during slaughter except large company slaughter in some countries. Thus there is no general incentive for training and compliance day-to-day, for most animals in most countries.\u201d \u201cThe owner of the slaughterhouse recounted that he once welcomed a group of vet students to see the slaughter process. He said that many of the students vomited,\u201d said McArthur Training should involve all stakeholders in the supply chain regarding the risks to welfare, food and worker safety involved with inhumane slaughter, said Blaszak. And the training must demonstrate how humane slaughter benefits animals, workers, traders, producers, retailers and consumers, she adds. \u201cThere\u2019s a plethora of science that demonstrates this.\u201d Thailand does have a specific good manufacturing process (GMP) regarding operations in pig slaughterhouses. However, \u201cwhile it states that \u2018pigs shall be rendered completely unconscious prior to slaughter\u2019, that practice is only promoted and not enforced\u201d, said Pumpradit. A Thai slaughterhouse worker dismantles a pig carcass In 2014, Thailand passed its first-ever animal welfare act, which covers pets, working animals and animals for food. Exceptions include animals killed for traditional sport and religious reasons. In 2016, a 23-year-old woman was the first person to be prosecuted under the law after she threw her roommate\u2019s chihuahua from their fifth-floor Bangkok apartment window. The incident sparked outrage on social media, but in a nation notorious for its troubled tiger temples, elephant sanctuaries and rampant wildlife trafficking, the concept of what constitutes animal cruelty is evidently unclear. Welfare groups, along with the Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (TSPCA), hope to work together with the Thai government to strengthen the role of law enforcement regarding humane slaughter. But Pumpradit is not expecting immediate miracles. \u201cThe TSPCA were the first to introduce the animal welfare act, and that took about 20 years,\u201d said Pumpradit. \u201cIt will be a long battle. Law and regulation is one thing, but law enforcement is the most challenging. If you don\u2019t enforce, people are not likely to comply when behind closed doors.\u201d The need for animal welfare reform everywhere in the region is acute, said Blaszak, who adds that pigs are highly intelligent animals capable of feeling intense pain and suffering. \u201cLocal consumers deserve pork that has been raised and slaughtered to good welfare standards along with the intrinsic benefits of good meat quality and safety.\u201d Slaughterhouse workers butcher pigs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
