It was six minutes to two, time to go, and in the tunnel at the Benito Villamar\u00edn 21 players lined up ready to go out alongside the referee, Valent\u00edn Pizarro G\u00f3mez, and one of his assistants. Just up the stairs, the other linesman stood by the dressing-room door, flag in one hand, getting a little impatient. \u201cWe\u2019re only missing Joaqu\u00edn,\u201d he called down, \u201c\u2026 yeah I know.\u201d Alongside him the Betis manager, Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2018Rubi\u2019, wore a look that said what do you want me to do? so the linesman took a step inside. \u201cCome on Joaqu\u00edn!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s go mate. We\u2019re waiting for you here.\u201d Rubi looked at his watch, then stuck his head round the door, nervous now. The next time he looked it said one minute past two, 01.28 on the screens around the stadium, and the place was going wild. Joaqu\u00edn had finally left the dressing room, high-fived his manager and, with linesman in tow shouting \u201ccome on let\u2019s go\u201d, led them into the sunshine. He had shaken hands with all of Athletic\u2019s players, Betis\u2019s anthem booming round as he went along the line, and posed for a team picture with dozens of kids, many in wheelchairs. He had chosen ends, I\u00f1aki Williams calling wrong, stood head bowed in silence in honour of former player Francisco Aparicio, and belted the ball into the net. He had been out only seven minutes, touched the ball only twice, and hadn\u2019t even been playing 90 seconds, but he had already scored. Nine minutes and three seconds later, he had scored again. And nine minutes and 19 seconds after that, he had scored another. It had taken 19 minutes. Nineteen minutes and 19 years, which made it all the more special. Five times Joaqu\u00edn had touched the ball, three times he had guided it into the net, all of them perfect finishes. He had thumped at his chest when he got the first, hand pounding at the badge of the club where he began his career, owns 2% of the shares, and wants to be the president one day; now he thumped it harder, heart racing, standing before the crowd, arms wide. \u201cThe euphoria,\u201d he said later, \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe it.\u201d Nor did anyone else. Athletic had the league\u2019s best defence, conceding just nine times; now, in less than 20 minutes they had let in a third again, the scoreboard showing 19.50 and 3-0. And that was just the start, each stat sillier than the last, leaving you to choose which you liked best. \u201cMy daughters didn\u2019t stop crying: they\u2019re not used to seeing their dad score goals. They said: \u2018Hey Dad, how cool that you scored three goals; I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever do that,\u2019\u201d Joaqu\u00edn admitted later. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Nor did I.\u2019\u201d He arrived on 100 goals, averaging just over one every eight games across his career and he had never scored a hat-trick, not even at youth level. The Benito Villamar\u00edn had not seen any of their players score a hat-trick since Finidi George, 22 years earlier. And only six players had scored a hat-trick inside 20 minutes for anyone, anywhere. But now he\u2019d gone and blown away all those records in the blink of an eye. Yet if it was fast, it was also slow: it had taken Joaqu\u00edn until he was 38 years and 140 days old to get a hat-trick, long after most have retired. On Sunday he was the oldest man on the pitch \u2013 and that includes the referee \u2013 and became the oldest player to score three in a La Liga match, overtaking Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano at 37 years 255 days in 1964. This is his 20th senior season; he has scored in all of them. The day Joaqu\u00edn made his first-team debut, at the start of 2000-01, the Betis captain Juan Merino hid his boots. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have to clean them,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn told him. Today, Merino would have to join a queue. Joaqu\u00edn won the Copa del Rey, one of only three trophies in the club\u2019s history, posing with the trophy wearing nothing at all and then placing it at the altar when he got married a few days later. Back then, most expected him to be a superstar somewhere. When it was suggested that his dad was off negotiating a move away Joaqu\u00edn replied: \u201cNah, he\u2019s on the sofa at home with his arse hanging out the back of his trousers as usual.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea came. And he was the gal\u00e1ctico that never was, Florentino P\u00e9rez making a show of publicly courting him. But in the end he joined Valencia after six seasons at home \u2013 not least because Betis needed him to. He went to M\u00e1laga and Fiorentina, then he came back again. He was 34; he\u2019d be lucky to have a season ahead of him, most thought. That was four and a half years ago now, and there will be more. Betis are expected to announce a new contract soon, taking him beyond his 40th birthday, Joaqu\u00edn joking on Sunday night that he could turn the screw a little bit now. Not that it is just the hat-trick; it is the three games in a row he has scored, the role played both on and off the pitch in pulling Betis away from the relegation zone and their manager away from the sack, the way he is playing. It is 12 years since Joaqu\u00edn was in the Spain squad \u2013 the country\u2019s best player at the 2002 World Cup, the kid who least deserved to miss in that shootout against South Korea \u2013 but it might not be so daft to suggest he would fit in again now. In the past couple of years, he has actually got better. When Lionel Messi said the words that couldn\u2019t be unsaid last week, depressing everyone when he admitted, at 32, that retirement is close, Joaqu\u00edn noted: \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t got my physique, has he?\u201d He was joking but there was something in it, something that expressed hope for everyone, maybe even Messi. His dad reckons he is so strong because he was breast fed until he was seven. And yet it\u2019s psychological too, enthusiasm renewed over the past couple of years. Derby wins followed with Setien, a new style that suited him: after one, in which he scored the winner, he said could leave football \u201ca happy man\u201d, but staying made him even happier man, and that\u2019s the key. The day after Messi scored his 35th league hat-trick \u2013 more than anyone else ever \u2013 Joaquin scored his first \u2013 later than anyone else ever. This was something to celebrate, for all of us. Joaqu\u00edn put out a video saying he was exhausted and staying at home, only to crack up and giggle: \u201cNo one believes that for a minute,\u201d announcing: \u201cI\u2019m off out for a wee drink.\u201d Meanwhile, his feat was splashed across every front page. \u201cSuperhero\u201d, \u201cJoaqu\u00edn performs magic\u201d, \u201cMonumental\u201d, ran the three headlines in Diario de Sevilla alone. What he had done was a reminder of the power of enjoyment, further evidence that a grin isn\u2019t a handicap and a joke isn\u2019t a crime, still unprofessionalism; that scowling seriousness is not the only route to success, and happiness helps. Everyone\u2019s favourite cheeky scamp, more famous for his gags than his goals, Joaqu\u00edn isn\u2019t just a comedian, he is also a competitor; he\u2019s not still playing because he\u2019s funny, but he may well still be playing because it\u2019s fun, another way of clinging to your childhood. \u201cI have kids of 19 and one of 38 in my team,\u201d Rubi said. Emerson, who provided the assist for the first, was one the day Joaqu\u00edn made his first-team debut. Diego La\u00ednez, playing alongside him, was two months old. Loren Moron made the third. His dad played against Joaqu\u00edn, now he plays with him, just like Sergio Canales. \u201cGranddad,\u201d Canales wrote on the ball, \u201cit\u2019s an honour to play with you.\u201d \u201cThe dickhead,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn laughed as he read it out on the radio. \u201cIf I had known how much hassle there would be, I wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn joked on Sunday night. He might even have scored more, the clock showing 90.57 when he raced into the area and drew a sharp save from Unai Sim\u00f3n. \u201cI was as stiff as dried cod: if I\u2019d stopped to control it, I\u2019d have fallen over,\u201d he said. Besides, three was just enough. Athletic pulled two back but Betis had won again \u2013 that\u2019s three in a row now, a single defeat in six, Europe in sight instead of relegation \u2013 and standing pitchside at the end the ball under his arm, Joaqu\u00edn was beaming, barely able to believe it. \u201cThis was my first hat-trick and I think it\u2019ll be my last,\u201d he said. Back in the dressing room, everyone was waiting for him again. When at last he arrived, they got to their feet and gave him a standing ovation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
