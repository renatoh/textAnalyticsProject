Fonte said: \u201cSlaven Bilic was also a very big influence. I thought he really wanted me and he sold me the project and the ambition of the club. I also have part of my family living in London and they are big West Ham fans. It just made sense for me at this stage to join West Ham. It is a new challenge and a new beginning and I am looking forward to it. \u201cWith the way that West Ham is going we can only look to be challenging in the top eight. I told the manager we want to win and we want to win trophies. The ambition is big and we need to aim high. West Ham are a massive club and it is an exciting challenge and it should be for everyone. We all need to get together and start working.\u201d Fonte joined Southampton from Crystal Palace in 2010 when the Saints were still in League One. He has not played since the 3-0 defeat at Everton on 2 January after submitting a transfer request. West Bromwich Albion was also interested in signing Fonte and could now make a move for the Angers defender Romain Thomas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
