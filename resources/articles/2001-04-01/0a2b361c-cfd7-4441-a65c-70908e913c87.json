The first gives a neater result, while the second, which I think the more interesting, is not for the fainthearted. It includes turning the chicken over in the pan so that the cheese topping melts into the pan juices, resulting in a deeply savoury finish. For 2, as a main dish with salad. 2 large boneless chicken breasts 50g butter 100g mozzarella cheese, cut into 5mm slices 2 tbsps groundnut or vegetable oil 3 tbsps pesto from the jar freshly ground black pepper Cut each breast in half lengthways and flatten with a rolling pin between two sheets of clingfilm, until they are 5mm thick. Be gentle, you don't want a pur\u00e9e. Cook the chicken in the melted butter and oil in a shallow pan for 1-2 minutes on each side. Without removing the chicken from the pan, spread each piece with a tablespoon pesto sauce, place a slice of mozzarella on top of the pesto and sprinkle with pepper. Now, EITHER: pick up the chicken with a fish slice and place it in a grill pan. Flash under a preheated hot grill till the mozzarella melts. Add the remaining pesto to the pan with 2 tablespoons water and stir. Remove the chicken from the grill and pour over the pan juices, OR: turn the chicken over with a palette knife so that the cheese is on the bottom. As soon as it starts to melt and sizzle, scoop each piece up with a fish slice, making sure that the melted cheese is not left behind. Turn the chicken over, the cheese and pesto now tantalisingly melted, and place in a warm serving dish, easing the cheese from the slice with a palette knife. Add the remaining pesto and 2 tbsps water to the pan, in which some of the pesto and cheese will be left behind, and stir, scraping up all the crusty bits in the pan. Pour the pesto pan juices over the chicken and eat immediately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
