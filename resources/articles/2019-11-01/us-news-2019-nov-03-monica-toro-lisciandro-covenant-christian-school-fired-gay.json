Monica Toro Lisciandro said her summary dismissal by the head of the Covenant Christian school in Palm Bay highlights a lack of workplace protections in Florida for LGBTQ people before a landmark supreme court decision on the issue expected by next spring. Only 21 states currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The 37-year-old drama teacher and dance studio owner said she felt shamed and demeaned by the accusatory tone of the school\u2019s head, Lorne Wenzel, and assistant principal, Shannon Schrope, during a meeting convened following a parent\u2019s complaint. \u201cI don\u2019t talk this way, but they said: \u2018There are allegations you\u2019re in a relationship with a woman, you attend Pride and you host homosexual activities at your studio,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, OK, we have a Rainbow Project at the studio that\u2019s for kids looking for a safe space, and for volunteering in the community. That\u2019s what they meant by homosexual activities. \u201cIt was very much like I was dirty, I was bad. So I said: \u2018Yes, it\u2019s true.\u2019 And they said: \u2018You can\u2019t work here.\u2019 They spoke about sin and how they wouldn\u2019t bring somebody in who was cheating on their spouse, and that if I didn\u2019t engage in homosexual activity I could still teach there. I was waiting for them to tell me I was going to hell.\u201d Lisciandro, who has been in a relationship with her partner, Natalia Dick, 38, for more than a year, said she was in tears by the end of the meeting and offered to hand in her classroom keys and computer. \u201cThey said: \u2018Oh no, we want you to teach today. We want you to pass the baton to the new teacher to avoid embarrassment for you, and to keep the school\u2019s reputation intact.\u2019 It was going to be this whole theme about why I was leaving, you know, some personal stuff, this, that and the other.\u201d Initially at least, the school, which has 283 fee-paying students from kindergarten to high school, did not tell parents the reason for the abrupt departure of Lisciandro, who taught drama classes part-time for three years. \u201cI am sorry to say that for personal reasons Mrs Lisciandro is not able to continue teaching our musical theater class,\u201d Wenzel wrote in an email. But after Florida Today published a story about the dismissal, Wenzel issued a statement, reported by NBC, confirming he had fired her because she was gay. \u201cCovenant Christian school requires that all employees must agree to and model our position on human sexuality, which is based on the biblical teaching that asks all Christ followers to abstain from any sexual activities outside of a one-man, one-woman marriage,\u201d he wrote. Wenzel did not respond to a request for comment. Lisciandro, however, claimed the school conveyed no such policy when she was hired. \u201cThey never said that. They lost their drama teacher and said they were really in a bind and needed someone to come in and direct it. Now they say you can\u2019t be Christian and hold a position of leadership in the school if you\u2019re gay,\u201d she said. A \u201cnon-discrimination policy\u201d on the school\u2019s website states it \u201cdoes not discriminate on the basis or race, color, or national or ethnic origin\u201d. A Florida Today story from May about the state\u2019s taxpayer dollars supporting private religious schools refers to a student handbook, since removed from the school\u2019s website, which stated that students who are homosexual are subject to expulsion. \u201cIn their statement it\u2019s like we affirm everyone, we value everyone. But you can\u2019t work here if you\u2019re gay, so you really don\u2019t affirm me,\u201d Lisciandro said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t teach children, if I\u2019m a good teacher but I can\u2019t teach children just because I\u2019m gay, then you don\u2019t affirm my worth. It\u2019s so hypocritical. \u201cBefore I came out two years ago I was almost suicidal. I was worried I was going to ruin everything and everybody\u2019s lives. I was married to a man and I have three kids. I\u2019ve done a lot of work loving myself and accepting myself, then in that moment, in that meeting, it took me back to those feelings. If I felt that kind of shame as an adult who spent years coming to terms with everything, I can only imagine how students would feel.\u201d With no legal protections in place in Florida, Lisciandro said she could not fight her dismissal, but wanted to prevent the same thing happening to somebody else. \u201cIf it can help someone, that\u2019s the reason for speaking out,\u201d she said. Joe Saunders, senior political director for Equality Florida, said the case is proof of the need for legal protection for LBGTQ workers. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that in 2019 anybody in Florida, or anywhere, is fired for being who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in a moment when the supreme court has ruled definitively in support of marriage equality but, where there are no local protections against discrimination, people can put a picture of their legal married partner, their husband or wife, on their desk and be fired for it. \u201cOr, in the case of Monica, go to a Pride event and stand with their community, and come into work the next day and be told that they\u2019re immoral and lose their livelihoods because of it.\u201d Saunders said his group has been trying for years to get protections for LBGTQ workers through Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature, and would try again next year. According to Step Up for Students, a state-approved not-for-profit group, 118 of Covenant Christian\u2019s 283 enrolled students have their tuition fees of up to $7,734 annually met by Florida\u2019s tax credit scholarship program. Additionally, the school also accepts taxpayer-funded scholarships from two other state programs, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. \u201cThe legislature could act tomorrow and say that if you are a private religious school receiving public education dollars it\u2019s illegal for you to discriminate against teachers and students,\u201d Saunders said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
