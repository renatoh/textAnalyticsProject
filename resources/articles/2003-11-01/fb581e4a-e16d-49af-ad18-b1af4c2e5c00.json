When the Today programme fell off air on Friday, it was down to Clare Runacres to save the day. Runacres, based at Broadcasting House in central London, took over when the power failed at the BBC's White City news headquarters. Sounding slightly flustered, she said: \"I'm sorry, we seem to be having having problems bringing the Today programme, but we will try and rejoin them as soon as we possibly can.\" Regaining her composure, she reached for the well-practised crisis-saver: \"In the meantime, here's some music.\" (Pedants might like to know that the tracks were all by Poulenc: Mouvement Perp\u00c0tuel No 1, Pastourelle, and Improvisations Nos 2, 13 and 15. The recordings were by pianist Pascal Rog\u00c0.) Between tracks, she apologised for the fault, before she was able to read a news bulletin. In the meantime, presenters Edward Stourton and Sarah Montague rushed to a studio in an unaffected part of BBC Television Centre. On Radio 5 Live, there were two minutes of \"dead air\" when nothing was broadcast, before engineers played a recording of an interview with Sir David Attenborough conducted by the station's afternoon presenter, Simon Mayo. The electrical meltdown was particularly problematic for the station's breakfast show co-host Victoria Derbyshire, who is heavily pregnant: like her colleagues at Radio 4, she had to decamp to another studio with Mark Pougatch, who was standing in for Nicky Campbell. Sir David also came to the rescue of BBC News 24, which used a recording of an interview with him to fill in time. Staff were back at Television Centre in the mid-afternoon, and the 6pm and 10pm bulletins on BBC1 were broadcast as normal. BBC engineers have launched an investigation into the critical failure, which has caused the postponement of a widely-publicised relaunch of BBC News 24. Television news programmes were shifted from Television Centre in west London to back-up accommodation in Westminster when the power failure hit. BBC executives said their contingency plans worked smoothly, but admitted that serious questions would be asked about why backup power supplies were also knocked out. There are concerns that the supply is not robust enough to cope with the heavy demands placed on it. The problem began at 7.52am with the apparent meltdown of a crucial \"bus bar\" - a device that conducts heavy electrical currents to several circuits - in the BBC's backup electrical supply. That caused a failure in the main power system and also prevented the last-resort diesel generators from coming on stream. The BBC said the meltdown caused \"some smoke, but no fire\". One insider quipped: \"It seems that those of us who thought there was no smoke without fire have been wrong for all these years.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
