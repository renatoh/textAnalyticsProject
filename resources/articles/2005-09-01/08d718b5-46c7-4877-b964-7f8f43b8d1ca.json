Agcert, which raised \u00a361m on the stock market just over three months ago, intends to collect carbon \"credits\" so they can be traded with energy intensive companies in the mining and oil industries to help to meet the objectives of the Kyoto protocol. It is doing so by building pits for pig manure in Brazil and Mexico which will capture the escaping methane - a particularly bad greenhouse gas - and burn it to produce less damaging CO2 The company said its construction plans have been delayed by up to a year, so it will not be able to collect as many credits as it had planned by the end of 2006. Farmers get only 10% of the value of the credits so the rest provides revenue for Agcert's business. It blamed problems in buying the flares to burn off the methane, regulatory issues, adverse weather conditions and spiralling costs. Chief executive Alan Tank has left immediately and director Bill Haskell will take over his role, with a board overseeing operations. The company's finance director is Paul D'Alton, who left troubled china company Waterford Wedgwood this year. \"The directors remain confident that the economics of the business are sound and believe that the impact on expected results described is principally a matter of timing,\" the company said. Agcert's shares, which sold at 140p on flotation, sank 48% to 120p yesterday. The news also hit the shares of XL Techgroup, a technology commercialisation company which joined the stock market less than a year ago. Agcert was its first venture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
