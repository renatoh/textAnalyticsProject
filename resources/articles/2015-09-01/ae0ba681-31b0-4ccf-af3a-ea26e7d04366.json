The Belgian could make his debut at Crystal Palace on Saturday because of David Silva\u2019s ankle problem. Despite De Bruyne becoming City\u2019s most expensive player, Pellegrini shrugged off the cost on Friday. The manager pointed to how Raheem Sterling, for whom City paid Liverpool \u00a344m plus add-ons in July, has settled in instantly. \u201cI will answer the same as I said about Raheem,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe price \u2013 maybe at the beginning everyone will talk about the price. At the end it\u2019s part of the game of the player, the team, to demonstrate why we brought him here. There can be very cheap players \u2013 they play very well, and maybe expensive players, they don\u2019t do so well. \u201cI am sure when I started with Raheem \u2013 within two or three games he demonstrated why we brought him here. I am sure with Kevin De Bruyne, at the end of the season, no one will remember how much we paid for him.\u201d De Bruyne previously had an unsuccessful spell with Chelsea but Pellegrini would not comment on that. \u201cI can\u2019t analyse that because I don\u2019t have the information,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent teams, different moments.\u201d While Silva is ruled out of the Palace game, Pellegrini believes the playmaker should be available for Tuesday evening\u2019s visit of Juventus for their opening Champions League group match. \u201cHe is out for tomorrow [Saturday],\u201d said the Chilean. \u201cMaybe it is a risk for him to take a knock in the same spot, so maybe it is better for him to rest for a couple of days.\u201d Asked if Silva would be fit to face Juventus, Pellegrini said: \u201cWe hope so, we will see.\u201dFabian Delph could miss up to a month and a half due to the hamstring injury the midfielder suffered in the opening 10 seconds of England\u2019s win over Switzerland on Tuesday. \u201cIt is not the same injury [as in pre-season],\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt is the same leg, the same muscle but not the same part.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
