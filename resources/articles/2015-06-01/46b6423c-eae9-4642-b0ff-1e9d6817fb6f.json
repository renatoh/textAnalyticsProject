His lasting contribution lay in demonstrating how to create safer and more effective ways for doctors, nurses and others to work together, in an environment of learning from mistakes. The work he pioneered, and was passionate about, resulted in safer and better care for patients. As director of clinical governance for the NHS (1999-2006), and then as deputy chief medical officer for England from 2003, under Liam Donaldson, he helped establish consistent standards of care across the English NHS. He ran an innovative training establishment in Leicestershire, Elision Health (2006-2008), where surgical and multidisciplinary teams could develop their skills. In 2007, as director of education at University College London Hospitals (UCLH), he commissioned a state-of-the-art education centre, a learning hospital equipped with cameras and simulated theatre and wards, and rooted in the science of human factors, which seeks to understand how people behave and interact in particular situations. The death of a homeless man outside UCLH resulted in Halligan and Nigel Hewett setting up a specialist homeless team in 2009. Halligan saw there was both system failure and profound injustice in the way homeless people were treated by the NHS, and he set up an independent charity, Pathway, in 2010, to address this problem. There are now Pathway teams in 10 hospitals across the UK, and many thousands of homeless people have received better care as a result of Halligan\u2019s vision. As chief of safety for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals (2008-13), he appointed the first-ever independent patient safety ombudsman, with a whistleblowing remit. During this period he visited Camp Bastion field hospital in Afghanistan, the busiest and clinically most challenged A&amp;E in the world, a multinational hospital led by British regular and NHS reservist doctors and nurses. The experience convinced him that if well-led teams, with a holistic focus on the patient, can function in such an environment, then that must be possible within the NHS. This led him to establish an NHS Staff College at the UCLH Education Centre in 2010. Its role was to allow clinicians, and managers in particular, to learn how the best of the Camp Bastion clinical approach could be adapted to improve NHS care. In Life in the Slow Lane: Making Hospitals Safer, an article published in the journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 2012, Halligan and colleagues set out evidence of a successful approach to learning from mistakes. From 2014 until his death, Halligan was director of Well North, a Public Health England initiative to improve the health of underprivileged people across the north of England. He sought to help people voice what matters to them and, with the support of their community, take action to address those concerns. Halligan was born in Dublin, son of Michael and Maureen (nee O\u2019Connell). He went to school at Templeogue College, Dublin, and qualified in medicine from Trinity College Dublin, in 1984, alongside Carol Furlong, whom he married the following year. Halligan was appointed lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at Leicester University in 1993, and in 1997 became the youngest professor in his speciality of foetal maternal medicine. A voracious reader, he was particularly interested in military history, always on a quest to learn more about leadership. He also played the accordion. Halligan is survived by Carol, and their daughters, Molly, Becky and Daisy. \u2022 Aidan William Francis Halligan, surgeon and medical administrator, born 17 September 1957; died 27 April 2015"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
