Public Health England confirmed that a student at the university and a relative of theirs had tested positive for the UK\u2019s first cases of the virus. Joseph, a second-year English student, said he had no serious concerns after hearing the news: \u201cI think the university\u2019s done a really good job of helping people stay calm and giving out the official advice. None of my friends are that concerned either \u2013 they\u2019ve even been making jokes, including some puns about corona being a beer. So no, I\u2019m not worried: it seems to have been contained.\u201d Others felt more apprehensive. \u201cEveryone feels a bit unsettled,\u201d said law student Daniel Williams. \u201cIn my house group chat, everyone is legitimately concerned. I live with a few European citizens who aren\u2019t registered with a GP and they are seriously thinking about whether they should go to lectures.\u201d He added that another student with a weakened immune system went straight home because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take the risk\u201d. Williams said he had noticed more Asian students were wearing masks on campus but that it was to be expected as \u201cwe are all worried, knowing [the virus] is in such close proximity\u201d. Social policy students Shuo Liu, 25, and Zhaoyuan Wang, 24, said that although they didn\u2019t feel the situation in the UK was that serious compared with China, they wore masks \u201cjust in case\u201d. They said they felt people were looking at them differently because they are Chinese. Liu, from Hunan province, said: \u201cPeople stare at us because we are wearing masks. They think that because we are Chinese we\u2019re carrying it, without thinking about whether we have even been to China recently or not.\u201d In a statement emailed to students by the university, Public Health England said the affected student \u201cdid not come into contact with anyone on campus whilst they had symptoms of the virus\u201d. But another undergraduate, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said: \u201cIt is shocking to know it\u2019s so close. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been given enough information. From speaking to friends, there is definitely a touch of panic on campus \u2013 exams were only a couple of weeks ago, so this could possibly have already spread further than one student. An awful lot of students including myself will be wary going into lectures on Monday, worried about who may or may not have the virus.\u201d The two Chinese nationals fell ill at Staycity Aparthotel in York last Wednesday and were taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle the following day by health professionals wearing hazmat suits. The hotel sealed the apartment where the patients had stayed, but the rest of the building has remained open. Biology student Kate Bunting said it was \u201cquite scary\u201d to learn that the patients had been living at Staycity as it\u2019s close to where she lives. However, the second-year biology student said she and her friends felt some of the media coverage was scaremongering: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as scary as it sounds, the fact that there\u2019s a low risk of further contamination gives me some security, and it\u2019s only because it\u2019s here that people find it a bit scary. But nobody I know is changing their behaviour because of it and the uni\u2019s done a good job of updating us throughout the week. It\u2019s just been a normal day on campus, it\u2019s quiet but then it always is on a Saturday.\u201d In the north-west, where 83 evacuees had travelled from Wuhan to Wirral, Matt Raw and his wife were relieved to be in Arrowe Park hospital on Saturday, on the first day of their mandatory two-week quarantine. \u201cWe have all the essentials we need,\u201d he said of their digs, which the couple were sharing with a mother and daughter, in a block next to Wirral University Teaching hospital. Despite the possibility that he might be infected, Raw was in bright spirits. \u201cThere is an army of people here who are looking after us extremely well,\u201d he said. Residents of Wirral were less enthusiastic at the arrival of the cohort from China on Friday night, despite Public Health England and Wirral University Hospital urging patients to remain calm and attend their appointments as normal. In Wuhan, one British citizen remained stranded with his wife and family, worried that they would be forgotten by the UK government. Chris Hill, 38, has chosen to remain in the country where he lives with his wife, Caitlyn Gao, and daughter, Renee Gao, who are both Chinese citizens. \u201cMy only worry now is after everybody pulls out, the FCO will forget about those who are staying and not give any support for us,\u201d he said. \u201cFor British nationals that are staying in Wuhan, but also in China, to have the consulate and embassy evacuating, it\u2019s not a good sight to see really, is it?\u201d Mr Hill, who is from Sunderland, said he received a call from the FCO on Saturday morning saying he, his wife and daughter would be able to get on an evacuation plane bound for France. But his wife is unable to leave because she works as a nurse at a hospital and is also unwilling to abandon her parents. \u201cI am not willing to leave her behind and take my daughter,\u201d Mr Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s either we all go or we all stay in Wuhan, which I told the FCO officer and she was shocked at my answer but respected my choice to not break up the family.\u201d As of early Sunday morning local time, the total number of cases of coronavirus diagnosed in China stood at 14,380, according to China\u2019s national health commission. In the course of Saturday, 45 more residents died from the disease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
