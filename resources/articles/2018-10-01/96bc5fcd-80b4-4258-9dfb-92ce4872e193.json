There was blood, there was sweat and there were certainly plenty of tears. And, in a week where the word \u201cemotion\u201d has perhaps been thrown around more than ever before in rugby league, on the game\u2019s biggest stage of all, there was an outpouring of which anyone of a Wigan association could only have dreamed this summer. When it was announced that Shaun Wane\u2019s 35-year association with his hometown club would end this year, it was clear then that Wigan\u2019s season was going to go one of two ways. For a few weeks, as the announcements followed about players such as John Bateman and Sam Tomkins following him out of the door, it looked as though it would be costly. In the end, though, perhaps it was fitting that Wane\u2019s Wigan did exactly what they have become renowned for under the guidance of one of the town\u2019s favourite sons: rise to the occasion. This final incarnation of Wigan Warriors under Wane are not glitzy. They are not glamorous. But they are determined, resolute and, for the fifth time in the Super League era, they are champions. It was a double, too: earlier, a stoppage-time penalty by Charlotte Foley gave Wigan Warriors Women their first Grand Final triumph with an 18-16 victory over Leeds Rhinos at the Manchester Regional Arena. At Old Trafford, when Dom Manfredi crossed with three minutes remaining to finally secure the farewell Wane and his players were craving, it was difficult to know where to look first. On the field, Tomkins almost immediately burst into tears. On the sidelines, there were hugs aplenty for Wane and the granite-tough Wiganer, like his players, was unable to hide his emotions as the full-time hooter sounded and the celebrations began. \u201cLosing wouldn\u2019t have defined my career but I\u2019ve made a difference here. I\u2019ll miss everything about the place,\u201d he said. There have been a plethora of highs during Wane\u2019s journey from 16-year-old apprentice to first-team coach. This one will be tough to top whatever happens next as he embarks on a new journey in Scottish rugby union. League surely hasn\u2019t seen the last of him, though. A man with his track record is too big a loss for the sport. On any other night Manfredi\u2019s story \u2013 this was only his fifth game back from over two years out injured \u2013 would have grabbed the headlines. In the end, it was his two tries that proved to be the difference here. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019s the story \u2013 I\u2019ve a place in my heart for him,\u201d Wane said of the winger. But for every winner, there is a loser, and as in the Challenge Cup final this year, Warrington will look back on this as a night on which there were more than enough chances to win. It means their wait for the title will go into a 64th year in 2019, and just as at Wembley, Warrington\u2019s profligacy would come back to haunt them here. \u201cIt could have gone either way up until the 77th minute,\u201d their coach, Steve Price, reflected. \u201cIt was hard, and it was ferocious, but I\u2019m super proud of them. We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d This, Warrington\u2019s fourth Grand Final defeat in six years, could have easily had a different outcome had they built on Josh Charnley\u2019s early try which broke the deadlock. Wigan quickly replied when Manfredi finished Oliver Gildart\u2019s evasive break, but what followed thereafter was bone-crunching defensive superiority. Wane, you suspected, would have loved every minute of it \u2013 as he would have Tom Davies\u2019s expert finish from George Williams\u2019 kick which made it 8-4. There were plenty of flashpoints away from the tries \u2013 most notably when Tomkins\u2019 knees caught Daryl Clark as he collected a ball. \u201cThat would have been a yellow card if it was a normal game,\u201d Price said, but Tomkins escaped without being sent to the sin-bin. Warrington\u2019s chances continued well into the second half. On two separate occasions Stefan Ratchford \u2013 only the second player to win the Harry Sunderland Trophy while being on the losing side \u2013 was halted by Morgan Escar\u00e9, Wigan\u2019s French full-back who will define the success of the post-Wane era. And after standing up to Warrington\u2019s attack time and time again, with three minutes remaining, the moment he and his players were waiting for arrived when Manfredi dived over to secure yet another title for Wane and the club he has given his all for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect ending,\u201d was Wane\u2019s softly spoken, teary summation afterwards. The power of emotion, it seems, should not be underestimated after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
