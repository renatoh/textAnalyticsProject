I had my UK passport stamped in Cuba in 2000 and was then offered a job in the US. I panicked slightly as my passport was sent to the US embassy in London, but my sponsored US visa was given without any hassles. Anna Howard If you are travelling as a tourist, and have the appropriate visa, they don't stamp your passport on entry or exit. Lynn Eaton I was limited to 30 days instead of 90 in the US because I had a Cuban stamp in my Canadian passport; the US stamp was placed right by the Cuban one, to make it clear. Tim Burford Don't worry - once you have been to Cuba you won't want to go to the US again! Jess White &amp; Linda Clapham Rosi McNab asked if it is possible to combat jet lag by using pressure points. Two weeks ago I returned from Australia with a gizmo called No more JET LAG which I bought at The Sydney Museum for A$8 (\u00a33.27). As the booklet-cum-gizmo said, it is easy, effective, safe and works in all time zones. I followed the instructions to apply acupressure on the evening I returned from Australia and I suffered absolutely no symptoms of jet lag. My fellow-traveller used it after two days of feeling frightful and had overnight success. Unfortunately my local bookshop says it is not available in the UK. Can anybody help locate it? Christine Guedalla Nicky Thomas wanted to know the best areas in Hong Kong for a quick shopping spree. For bargains, head to the markets: Jade Market for pearls and semi-precious stones; Stanley Market for 'western size' clothes; Ladies' Market for accessories and petite clothes; Cat Street Market for Mao memorabilia and cheap 'antiques'; Night Market for cheap watches and electronic gizmos. For cameras and big-ticket electronic items, best stick to reputable chains such as Fortress. Vicky Button If you want to buy cheap clothes then definitely go to Stanley Market on the south side of Hong Kong island. The clothes come from the same factories as those exported to Europe and America, so you get the same quality at a fraction of the price. You don't need to haggle, but you can have a go if you like. Stanley is a beautiful seaside village so afterwards you can hang out in a bar or restaurant on the waterfront. A great day out. John Burgess To be frank, Hong Kong is not that cheap for shoppers because it is still the third most expensive city in the world. If you want just normal high street stuff, designer labels, Central District and Pacific Place on the Island side and Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side are the areas you should explore. If you want computer gear, go to Sham Shui Po Station and follow the tourists. Ap Liu Street nearby has a very good second-hand market for electronic goods. Causeway Bay area has a bit of everything and opens until late. Mong Kok, Tung Choi Street and the northern half of Fa Yuen Street are good for open markets. Humphrey Yiu, London This week's questions I'm arranging a girls' (late 20s/early 30s) getaway but don't want to go somewhere where the only thing to do is get completely trashed. Any ideas for somewhere in the UK that's not extortionate? Michelle Stones Is it possible to travel by ferry from the UK to St Petersburg so I can catch the Trans-Siberian Railway? Keith I've been told bathing in the Dead Sea is good for psoriasis. Are there any hotels there with health centres/spas?
