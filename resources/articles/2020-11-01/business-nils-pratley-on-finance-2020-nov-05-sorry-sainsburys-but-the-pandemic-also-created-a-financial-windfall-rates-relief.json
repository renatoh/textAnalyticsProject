All that hand sanitiser, plus the burden of paying so many staff to shield at home, adds up, don\u2019t you know? Simon Roberts of Sainsbury\u2019s offered other arguments: in the age of Amazon, the business rates system is unfair on bricks and mortar retailers. As if to reinforce his point, he unveiled plans to shut the doors permanently on 420 Argos standalone shops, with the potential loss of 3,500 jobs. You can understand why he\u2019s so prickly. The symmetry is awkward: Sainsbury\u2019s received relief on business rates worth \u00a3230m in the first half of its financial year, and now it\u2019s paying \u00a3231m in dividends to shareholders. Since the Qatar Investment Authority, with a 21% stake, will be the biggest beneficiary, it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say Sainsbury\u2019s is also feeding the nation of Qatar with dividends. To be scrupulously fair, a few of Roberts\u2019 points were accurate. Yes, the business rates system is rotten. Yes, the biggest chunk of the divi, worth \u00a3160m, relates to the pre-Covid financial period. And, yes, one shouldn\u2019t mix apples and pears: dividends and relief on rates are different items. But those arguments all miss the glaring inconsistency at heart of this issue. Rishi Sunak gave retailers relief on a property-based tax because most shops had to close during the first lockdown. But supermarkets remained open and, indeed, enjoyed a boom. They should never have been included in the rates giveaway. Sainsbury\u2019s revenues, like Tesco\u2019s and Morrisons\u2019, were the strongest in years. With the rates freebie covering most of the extra Covid costs, Sainsbury\u2019s underlying pre-tax profits surged by 26% to \u00a3301m in the half-year. The pandemic created a logistical challenge, but also a financial windfall. The mistake is really the chancellor\u2019s, of course. Over a full year, the supermarket industry will benefit from rates relief worth roughly \u00a31.5bn, money that would surely have been better directed at the hospitality or events industries. There is roughly zero chance of Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco or Morrisons\u2019s returning a few quid to the Treasury \u2013 but they should. WH Smith board joins list of indecent packages Remuneration committees need to calm down. The pandemic has crumpled a lot of companies\u2019 share prices, and thus the value of many executives\u2019 share-based incentives. But the apparent rush to reload directors with new bumper pay packages is indecent. The latest example is WH Smith. The board had the notion that now would be a fine moment to hand the chief executive, Carl Cowling, a share-incentive package worth almost \u00a35m, Sky News reported on Thursday. The thin justification, it seems, was that there\u2019s a big rebuilding job to do at WH Smith after the hit to the stores in airports and train stations; a three-year arrangement, in place of annual awards, would keep Cowling keen for the long-term, went the thinking. Forget it. The board cannot possibly know when normal service will resume in the travel market. WH Smith had to raise \u00a3165m from shareholders for pandemic protection as recently as April. Setting fair performance hurdles is virtually impossible at the moment. Fund managers killed the board\u2019s proposal before it could become formalised \u2013 quite right too. A \u00a35m package would have been wildly over the top in the current climate. If Cowling has to rub along for a while on his basic salary of \u00a3525,000, so be it. Insurers don\u2019t stir patriotic feelings Stephen Hester\u2019s decluttering and cost-cutting strategy at RSA, the FTSE 100 insurer, always seemed designed to attract a bid, and now it\u2019s happened. Canada\u2019s Intact Financial and Denmark\u2019s Tryg are in talks to agree a joint-offer at \u00a37.1bn. RSA\u2019s board says it\u2019s minded to accept, which is no surprise whatsoever. At 685p a share, the bid would equate to a takeover premium of roughly 50%, which doesn\u2019t come along often in the insurance game. Nor, one suspects, will there be any wailing over the loss of a large British company to an overseas predator. Insurers don\u2019t stir patriotic feelings. Nobody was bothered back in 2015 when Zurich attempted a bid for RSA before walking away. It feels a shame, though. RSA has had setbacks in the last couple of years. But, slimmed to its UK, Canada and Scandinavia core, it looked a more coherent and promising set-up than, say, Aviva.
