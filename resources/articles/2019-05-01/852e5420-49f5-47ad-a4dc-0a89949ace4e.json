Jewish students say they are frustrated at the slow pace of action at many universities, as well as cases where Jewish groups have been billed by universities for providing security for on-campus events. Chris Skidmore, the universities minister for England, said institutions should formally adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism \u2013 the same wording that caused controversy in the Labour party last year. \u201cThere is no place in our society for hatred or any form of harassment and it is frankly appalling that the battle against antisemitism still exists,\u201d Skidmore said. \u201cIt is unacceptable to oblige certain groups of students to incur additional costs because of their race or religion just to counteract the actions of others. \u201cInstitutions like King\u2019s College London are already displaying leadership in this area but I expect our universities, as vehicles of change, to show moral leadership and adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which shows that an institution and its senior leaders are serious about ensuring their campuses are tolerant environments where ideas and debate can flourish but persecution can never take hold.\u201d Daniel Kosky, the campaigns officer for the Union of Jewish Students, said a number of universities used the IHRA definition internally, and formal adoption would be \u201ca practical step to allow them to really tackle antisemitism\u201d. The IHRA definition, a one-paragraph summary with 11 examples, was written in 2016 and has since been adopted by the UK government. The definition states: \u201cAntisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\u201d Kosky said his organisation was aware of four or five instances in the last year of Jewish student groups being asked to pay for security for hosting high-profile events on campus. \u201cWe see that as unfair and we want to nip it in the bud,\u201d he said. Another issue is the slow pace of university disciplinary proceedings involving antisemitism and other hate crimes, with students complaining of cases dragging on for as long as 10 months and a lack of information on progress. Universities UK (UUK), which represents more than 135 universities in Britain, said its work in the area was ongoing. \u201cWe recommend universities do all they can to tackle antisemitism, including considering the IHRA definition, whilst also recognising their duty to promote freedom of speech within the law,\u201d a spokesperson said. Opinion remains divided within UUK, whose board voted not to adopt the IHRA definition last year. Some members argued the decision should be left up to individual institutions rather than infringe on their autonomy. Nick Hillman, head of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: \u201cThe government is recognising that Jewish student groups face particular challenges. Given recent rises in antisemitism in the UK and elsewhere, it is right that the minister shows support for Jewish students in this way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
