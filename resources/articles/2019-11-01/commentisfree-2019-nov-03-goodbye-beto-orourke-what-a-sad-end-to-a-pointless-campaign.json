What a sad end to a pointless campaign", "bodyText": "When Bernie Sanders was first asked about Beto O\u2019Rourke entering the presidential race, his reply was dismissive: \u201cFree country, anybody can run.\u201d But others thought O\u2019Rourke was a powerful new rival. The New York Times said that Sanders\u2019 \u201cstronghold on the party\u2019s progressive wing has weakened\u201d because he was now \u201coutflanked on the left by rising stars\u201d like O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke debuted with a splash: a long, flattering profile in Vanity Fair in which O\u2019Rourke \u2013 to his later regret \u2013 said \u201cMan, I\u2019m just born to be in it.\u201d He was not, as it turned out, born to be in it. After the initial burst of publicity, Beto fizzled quickly. His poll numbers never got out of single digits, and at first he didn\u2019t seem to know what he stood for or why he stood for it. Eventually, he hit upon a signature issue: gun control. But his provocative rhetoric \u2013 \u201cHell yeah, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15\u201d \u2013 seemed to backfire entirely, and he was accused of \u201churting the cause\u201d and even \u201csingle-handedly dooming a gun control bill.\u201d He continued to lack a following outside of Texas, a place where he could not even win a statewide election against the Senate\u2019s most reviled member. Perhaps the only person who ever truly thought Beto O\u2019Rourke was likely to be president was Beto O\u2019Rourke. What, if anything, can we take from the brief, underwhelming presidential run of Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke? First, media hype does not a candidacy make. Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post declared in March that \u201cBeto fundraising number[s] suggests Bernie now officially yesterday\u2019s news, faces stiff competition for youth vote\u201d. Indeed, Beto initially hauled in an impressive amount. But things change quickly in politics; remember that Rudy Giuliani and Jeb Bush were both once Republican frontrunners. Horse race pundits like to issue declarations and prophecies, but are just speculating. Political media is in constant need of new stories to tell, so we get a lot of \u201cCould Candidate X Be The Next Big Thing?\u201d coverage. The sensible thing to do is ignore most of this. Betomania was never likely to grip the country. We might also learn quite a simple lesson, namely that if you\u2019re going to run for president, it helps to have a good reason for it. A reason beyond being \u201cborn to be in it\u201d, that is. The Vanity Fair profile in which Beto debuted his national run was full of personal details about his life, such as his reading habits and his love of punk rock, but he didn\u2019t say much about what he wanted to do as president, beyond having the United States \u201clead the world\u201d. He also voiced uncertainty about being \u201cagainst\u201d things, saying he preferred to be \u201cfor\u201d things, which is fine if you specify the things you\u2019re for, but also a worrying sign that you\u2019re insufficiently outraged by injustice. You\u2019d think even Beto could have said he was against that, but he wouldn\u2019t even go so far as to say he was a progressive, saying he \u201c[didn\u2019t] know\u201d and was \u201cnot big on labels\u201d. Beto\u2019s campaign suffered from the same defect as Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Insider accounts confirmed Clinton could never really find a clear reason why she was in the race to begin with, and didn\u2019t have any kind of clear agenda in mind. It was mostly that she just wanted to be president, and felt like the sort of person who ought to be president. Like Pete Buttigieg, who talked about having the right \u201calignment of attributes\u201d for the job\u2014 \u2013 or him, an Ivy League education, military service, and small-town heartland authenticity \u2013 Clinton and O\u2019Rourke emphasized their personal traits over their political ideas. But people want substance: they need to know what you plan to do for their lives, not just why you\u2019re a cool person with the kind of haircut that the president might have in a movie. Beto\u2019s run always seemed like an ego trip. His family did not seem nearly as enthusiastic as he was about it, and his young son promised to \u201ccry every day\u201d if O\u2019Rourke went through with it. He got into trouble for casually joking about putting the burden of parenting on his wife as he criss-crossed Texas campaigning for the Senate. But fame and power are alluring, and O\u2019Rourke was one of dozens of politicians lured into the 2020 race by the promise of a national profile and a shot at the highest office. A slew of nondescript white men, including John Delaney, Michael Bennet, Tim Ryan, Seth Moulton and John Hickenlooper, were delusional enough to think they might stand a chance. They might not have been that irrational, though: even in failing, they succeed in making themselves more well-known and possibly even more influential. They\u2019ll all go eventually, though. With no original ideas, no movements behind them, they have nothing to offer the electorate, and the electorate knows it. O\u2019Rourke should never have run for president, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself, because some men are just convinced they\u2019re born for it.
