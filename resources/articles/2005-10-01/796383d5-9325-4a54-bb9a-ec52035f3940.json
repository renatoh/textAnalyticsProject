Initially nominated by their bosses, the PAs who get through to the final round are assessed by recruitment consultancy Office Angels. A chief aim of the awards is to encourage employers to say thank you to their PAs for doing such a great job. The other is to celebrate the increasing responsibilities of this group of professionals. \"When we first launched the awards eight years ago, we felt nobody was recognising the role of very senior PAs,\" explains Paul Jacobs, managing director of Office Angels. \"Their role had changed demonstrably since the beginning of the 90s - and has continued to do so - yet there was nobody singing its praises publicly. In many respects, executary PAs are the backbone of the office.\" With 5,000 entries this year - compared with 1,500 when the awards were launched - more and more PAs clearly are valued, and research to accompany this year's awards backs this up. A staggering 81% of employers claim the strength and breadth of their executaries' skills frequently leaves them in awe. Little wonder, when you consider that some of the main areas of PAs' work now include event organisation, marketing, public relations and human resources - all above and beyond traditional secretarial skills. That said, Wren, 30, believes there is some way to go in changing perceptions. \"I think things are a lot better than they were, but I still think there are a lot of people who don't quite realise the extent of what we do,\" she says. \"I think we could be paid more because of that change, too.\" When she first started in an admin job straight from school, she remembers the role having an old-fashioned status, much further down the hierarchy. \"We were very much a support, whereas now I work in partnership with my boss. I work with her, not for her,\" she explains. In Wren's 39-hour week (although she admits she usually works a lot more), she has a huge variety of tasks, including running meetings, managing projects, compiling complex reports, working with an office budget and managing two of her own support staff. But it's not all high-powered, she admits. \"There's always some filing that needs doing - my least favourite bit of the job.\" You need a can-do attitude to be a really good PA, she feels. \"I also think you need to be assertive, as well as very reason- able. Good negotiation skills help, too.\" Denise Greig, her fellow winner, agrees. The 31-year-old PA to the assistant director of voluntary housing organisation, Step Forward, won the category for team executary, so not surprisingly, she adds to Wren's list of attributes multi-tasking. \"Although I report to one main person, there are also three operations managers within the Midlands region who I work with,\" explains Greig, who lives in Nottingham. Her motivation to land an admin role when she left school came from her desire to organise. \"I like breaking things down and working on them point by point, and I like taking on projects from beginning to end,\" she says. \"Now, of course, my role has much more responsibility and I really love the variety that involves.\" Her reward comes from what is achieved by the organisation she works for. \"Step Forward is the support arm of the Metropolitan Housing Partnership and as such, we help people like the elderly, teenage mothers, women escaping domestic violence and the homeless live as independently as possible. It's so nice going home at night knowing you've helped someone have a better quality of life, and that is ultimately what I love about my job.\" Having previously worked in the private sector, she admits that working in a voluntary organisation has been an eye-opener. Nearly half of UK bosses in the Office Angels survey describe executaries as the ultimate flexiworkers, responding to changing roles, consistently challenging environments and colleagues. But not all coworkers recognise this. \"At one point, I was getting frustrated - besides having to do all the important stuff, people were giving me loads of little admin duties as well. I just didn't have enough hours in the day to get through it all,\" says Greig. She did what any self-respecting PA would do and asked for help. \"My boss got the finance department to cover the costs for an administrator to support me and everything became manageable again.\" Trust is the key component to any successful working relationship, she believes - a view seconded by 63% of employers interviewed by Office Angels. \"Particularly when you are working with more than one manager, and the kind of service users we have, a huge amount of trust and confidentiality is required.\" Greig also supports the survey result which found that 68% of bosses credit executaries with lifting morale by adding a personal touch to office life. She regularly organises Friday night drinks and birthday cakes for colleagues, mentors new staff and even remembers the names of clients' children. \"What executary PAs bring to the atmosphere can make all the difference to office culture,\" says Jacobs. Both Greig and Wren admit they found the assessment process for the awards rigorous. But they enjoyed the challenge and modestly described themselves as \"gobsmacked\" when the winners were announced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
