At the last tournament in Brazil the then manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, had talked about \u201cseven steps to heaven\u201d. His team, notoriously, would descend into hell after step six \u2013 the 7-1 humbling against Germany, which has hung over them ever since. The exorcism will be possible only if Brazil can go all the way in Russia and there is no doubt that failure is not exactly on the press agenda at present. A nation does not expect, it assumes and, given the way Tite has re-energised the set-up, who can blame them? The pressure is excruciating and, when Tite faced the media on the eve of Sunday\u2019s Group E opener against Switzerland, it seemed revealing that he was asked whether he was on any medication to help him sleep. His response \u2013 part humour, part conviction \u2013 reflected his comfort and it extends to the trappings of Brazil\u2019s tag of favourites. They are here to win it and Tite is not afraid to say so. \u201cAs somebody who has been through eight or nine surgeries, I take no drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to manage my ghosts, my angst, my human side. Yes, there is this expectation. I just try to focus on what matters. \u201cThe work we have done gives us the expectation but also a lot of inner peace. We have been building up to this for some time. Winning is a dream and my focus is totally geared to that. It feels like the world is looking at us but we want to be natural on the pitch, like we have been in all the games.\u201d Tite has given the captaincy to Marcelo for the Switzerland tie and, with Dani Alves out injured, it appears that he will continue to pass the armband around. He had previously indicated that Alves, who has captained the team the most during his tenure, would assume the responsibility in Russia. Each member of Tite\u2019s likely XI against Switzerland has captained the team, even the 21-year-old striker Gabriel Jesus. Marcelo, one of only six survivors from the last World Cup, radiated confidence, particularly when asked about the 7-1. \u201cThere is no longer any trauma,\u201d Marcelo said. \u201cIf there was, I wouldn\u2019t be playing any more. I would have retired. Of course, I wish it were different but there is no trauma. I always look for new goals and this World Cup is another challenge. \u201cThe captaincy is something that I like. When you are a kid playing on the beach, you dream of representing the national team and now I have the opportunity to be captain at a World Cup. Money cannot buy this feeling. In the group everybody contributes but I am 30 and, of course, you gain experience.\u201d In the numbers game that can colour match previews Tite can point to having suffered defeat only once in his 21 matches in charge \u2013 against Argentina in a friendly. There have been 17 wins. But there is another detail that seems to have slipped under the radar. It comes from the Switzerland side and it is the one that shows them in sixth position in the Fifa world rankings, looking down on France and Spain, among others. How the world governing body gets to its master-list is often questioned and mocked but do not tell the Swiss they do not deserve their status. \u201cWe have worked hard to have this ranking,\u201d Stephan Lichtsteiner, the captain, said. Before the Brazil game it underpins the quiet confidence that has built around their camp. Vladimir Petkovic\u2019s team are set up to pass and pass \u2013 everything goes through the midfield fulcrum Granit Xhaka \u2013 and there was the statistic from Euro 2016, when Switzerland reached the last 16, that showed they had enjoyed more possession than their opponents in every game, even against France in the final group tie, which finished 0-0. Switzerland have the utmost respect for Brazil and it was a snappy soundbite when Lichtsteiner said that Neymar, whom Tite revealed was not yet 100% fit after ankle and metatarsal damage, was \u201cpractically impossible to neutralise completely over 90 minutes\u201d. The right-back is set for a direct confrontation with Brazil\u2019s brightest star. \u201cHe is probably the best and most complete player in that position in the world,\u201d Lichtsteiner added. But he returned with a measure of swiftness to Switzerland\u2019s pre-match message \u2013 they are hellbent on showcasing their own game. \u201cIt\u2019s about us imposing ourselves and using our full-backs to get forward,\u201d Lichtsteiner said. \u201cWe have to be cohesive as a team and close the gaps when we confront players like Neymar.\u201d Petkovic mentioned how his team\u2019s mentality had grown during his four years in charge. They have lost only once in their previous 22 matches, winning 16 of them. \u201cI always focus on our way of playing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to dominate and win. We are not here to make a lovely match against Brazil but to win it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
