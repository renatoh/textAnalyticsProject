Thank you all for joining in \u2013 I\u2019ll also be liveblogging the Great British Bake Off Grand Final on Tuesday, so would be lovely to see you then. Otherwise I\u2019ll be back here for another spin round the Strictly dancefloor next Saturday from 7.05pm, or you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens. Have a brilliant week! They dance their final dance to Bat Out Of Hell, so at least we\u2019re spared awkward wedding dance shuffling. And as the song says, they\u2019ll be gone when the morning comes. It\u2019s been the best experience of Seann\u2019s life, we learn, apart from the last few weeks. Katya thanks him for his commitment (lol), and for making her laugh. This series has been quite the journey for all of us, but I\u2019m very much looking forward to a return to sparkly business as usual. So who will stay, and who will go? All the judges vote to save Graeme and Oti, which means SEANN AND KATYA are going home. And now a re-run of this of a brilliant piece of choreography from Katya, which mostly showcases what an incredible dancer she is, and how little progress Seann has made in recent weeks. If you imagine he\u2019s dancing to an entirely different song, his ability to keep time is vastly improved. To this song, sadly not so much. Dance-off time \u2013 first we\u2019re revisiting Graeme and Oti\u2019s Cemetary Cha Cha! This dance is not Graeme\u2019s finest work and he moonwalks like he\u2019s trying to wipe dog poo off his shoes. But on the other hand Oti is a goddess and Graeme very much embodies the spirit of this show \u2013 he knows it\u2019s all ridiculous, he\u2019s throwing himself at it, and watching them dance makes me smile. I\u2019d also forgotten how bad this version of Thriller is. Jacko must be spinning in his cryogenic ice pod. Has anyone listened to the official Strictly podcast? I love Scott Mills and keep meaning to, but haven\u2019t quite got round to it. So based on last night\u2019s scores, Seann and Katya should be going home. But this judging panel is fickle. What if they decide that the limited Cha Cha in Graeme and Oti\u2019s Thriller routine is a problem, as was the case with Vick and Graziano last week? More worryingly, what if Seann suddenly learns to count to three? So who is joining Seann and Katya in the dance-off? I\u2019m worried for Ranj, not going to lie. Charles and Karen are safe, along with Stacey and Kevin and Ranj and Janette (yesssss). So that means GRAEME AND OTI in the dance off. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of the UK\u2019s premium manufacturer of generic pop, Rita Ora. She\u2019s had more Top 10 singles than any other British female solo artist in history, I learned today. Which is testament to either a) the immense UK appetite for foot-tappy chart pop or b) the paucity of British female solo recording artists in the 30 years since Shirley Bassey/Petula Clark previously held this record. YOU DECIDE. This IS a tune, mind, and I\u2019m very much here for the dressing-up-box bridal outfit. Less so for bringing your own dancers. Rude. Seann and Katya looking thoroughly over this, to be honest. Seann looks like a man whose Uber is just round the corner. Also through to next week is Joe and Dianne, Faye and Giovanni and Kate and Aljaz. First couple in the bottom two this week: SEANN AND KATYA! So who is safely through to next week, and who is blessing us with a re-run of last night\u2019s dance? Ashley and Pasha are safe, along with Lauren and AJ and Danny and Amy. I love the way Kevin lifted his earmuff so he could hear the results. PREVIOUSLY ON STRICTLY: A Halloween House of Horrors. Highlights: Stacey and Kevin\u2019s Tango, Charles and Karen\u2019s Jive, Pashley\u2019s Charleston, Joe and Dianne\u2019s Foxtrot. Lowlights: Fluffy Ranj, Seann and Katya\u2019s timeless Viennese, Graeme\u2019s death by Cha Cha, and mean marking of Kate\u2019s Rumba. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH SPECIAL HALLOWEEN EDITION: Tess in a mesh curtain, Claudia in shoulder pads and toxic green heels. Nope. Oh lord, Shirley has embraced the fishnet too. Stop it. Tonight\u2019s Halloween Special bonus pro dance features evil table dancing, with Aljaz as king and Oti as a kick-ass queen (obviously). It\u2019s all quite sinister but rather fabulous. Aljaz in military apparel is the kind of leadership we all need. And we\u2019re off! We\u2019ve reached the point in the series where the credits are a handy reminder of Strictly couples I\u2019d entirely forgotten about. Lee and Nadiya! Remember them? Evening all, and welcome back for this week\u2019s Strictly Results Show! Last night\u2019s Halloween Spooktacular was the usual mix of great dancing, costume-encumbered dancing and \u2018we focussed on the theme and forgot to practice\u2019 dancing; much like the spoils of an evening\u2019s trick or treating, it was a very mixed bag. That said, I did watch Faye and Giovanni\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice during the freebie hour daylight savings gifted us this morning, and agree it was technically superb and deserving of high marks, I just find the jazz/theatre genre a bit cringy, no idea why. Perhaps I had a terrible jazz dance experience as a child. Tonight we have to send home another couple \u2013 Seann and Katya should be in the bottom two, and if they\u2019re not we\u2019ve all wildly underestimated their popularity (not for the first time). As for who\u2019s alongside them, my money\u2019s still on Graeme and Oti or Dr. Ranj and Janette \u2013 both had a bit of a shocker last night. Kick off is at 7.50pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! I\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7.50pm for the results, so join me then for the dreaded dance-off. Thanks for joining in, and enjoy the rest of your Saturday! Hx So that\u2019s it for the Halloween Spooktacular (DRINK)! That was quite fun, albeit a mixed bag on the dance front. Huge round of applause to the costume and makeup department as usual. Ashley and Pasha and Faye and Giovanni are joint top of the leader board, and Seann and Katya are at the bottom - wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find them in the bottom two tomorrow, maybe alongside Dr. Ranj and Janette or Graeme and Oti? My faves tonight were definitely Stacey and Kevin, Joe and Dianne and Ashley and Pasha, although I\u2019d probably slip Kate and Aljaz a vote for some mean marking. Scores: 6,7,8,8 - a total of 29 for Lauren and AJ. Craig thought Lauren\u2019s shaping could do with some work, but he loved her focus and energy. Darcey loved Lauren\u2019s attitude, but she needs more shaping. Shirley thought it was Lauren\u2019s best dance, and Bruno thought it was a strong, proud and powerful performance. So Lauren is supposed to be the Evil Queen from Snow White, whilst AJ looks like Westley from The Princess Bride. Nice log-splitting chopper action there. Lauren is doing a decent job of evil queen fierceness and focus, but her Paso lacks precision and her footwork is a bit stompy. Not nearly scary enough, sadly - a great effort but not enough attack. And FINALLY, it\u2019s LAUREN AND AJ! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Poison\u2019 by Nicole Scherzinger. I\u2019m not familiar with this song from the Scherzinger back catalogue, but she\u2019s the wicked queen of the pop banger. God, imagine being the Dave Arch singer who has to belt this out with Scherz IN THE AUDIENCE. Scores: 8,9,9,9 - a total of 35 for Joe and Dianne. Bruno though it was a Foxtrot with a bite, and Joe\u2019s improvement has exceeded his expectations \u2013 Joe is leading the dance and he\u2019s a good actor too. Craig loved the breakouts, and might even start following Joe on social media. Darcey loved the footwork, and we might well see Joe in the final. Shirley gives Joe a hug and talks about his nan \u2013 has anyone told her he\u2019s 27 and not 15? It\u2019s embarrassing, stop it. This has a Twilight fairground theme, with Joe spinning Dianne\u2019s Waltzer. Scream if you want to go faster. Joe has addressed all manner of issues with his frame and is actually starting to look like a proper dancer. Very much enjoying the literal pushing and pulling \u2013 not sure the music quite works but it was a pretty good effort from Joe. Enjoyed that. Only two left! Next up it\u2019s JOE AND DIANNE! This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Youngblood\u2019 by 5 Seconds of Summer. This is quite a stompy tune, more suited to something like a Tango (in my humble opinion). But the kids love a bit of 5SOS and it\u2019s got \u2018blood\u2019 in the title, so l\u2019m on board. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Faye and Giovanni. She isn\u2019t going to win either, the nation demands a journey. Shirley thought it was first class, and an outstanding routine. Bruno thought it had all that jazz, and Craig agrees that it was A-MAY-ZING. Darcey loved it too \u2013 a stunning performance. Fog! DRINK! Well this is...theatrical, although there\u2019s a bit too much floor humping for my liking and Faye actually does Jazz Hands. I\u2019m sure that from a dance perspective that was incredibly good, but absolutely not my cup of tea I\u2019m afraid. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s FAYE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re going for Couple\u2019s Choice \u2013 a Theatre/Jazz routine to \u2018Fever\u2019 by Peggy Lee. Very disappointed that Faye hasn\u2019t gone down the commercial route for her Couple\u2019s Choice \u2013 I was hoping for a dance medley of Steps\u2019 best moves at the very least. Still, Theatre/Jazz is absolutely my favourite thing*. I\u2019m not accepting \u2018Fever\u2019 as a Halloween song, nothing spooky about running a temperature. BINGO FULL HOUSE! Down the rest of the bottle. *This is a massive lie Scores: 6,6,6,7 - a total of 25 for Charles and Karen. Darcey thought it started with loads of attack and intent, but there were moments with timing issues and Charles feet were a bit flappy. Shirley loved the routine and concept, but there were quite a few mistakes. Bruno loved the wacky energy and it had an infectious appeal. Craig loved it too, it just needed a bit of tidying up. Shirley in those evil contacts AND the schoolmistress glasses is entirely terrifying. Can I just express my disappointment that Charles opted to play it safe as Riff Raff, rather than strapping himself into a basque, stockings and suspenders as Frank N. Furter? If you\u2019re going to do Rocky Horror, you might as well do it properly. I\u2019m aggrieved. I am however very happy about the amount of actual Jive in this - Charles has got great timing and is giving his kicks and flicks both barrels. Bags of energy, great routine, and brilliant characterisation - I\u2019m glossing over a few timing issues. LOVED that. Next up it\u2019s CHARLES AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Time Warp\u2019 from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, following in the hallowed (halloweened?) footsteps of Jamelia and Tristan. If you have a 3D TV, you might want to move your chair back a bit before Charles does the pelvic thrusts. I\u2019ll accept Time Warp as a Halloween song due to the film having the word \u2018horror\u2019. Also it\u2019s a horrible song. Scores: 3, 5,6,6 - a total of 20 for Seann and Katya. Kate and Aljaz really were robbed, weren\u2019t they? Craig thinks Seann might find himself in the dance off again - Seann had timing issues and it was too skippy. Darcey agrees - Seann needed to smooth things out. Shirley liked some of Seann\u2019s footwork but agrees there were mistakes and timing issues. Bruno loved the roleplay, but Seann lost the flow. As a Viennese Waltz, it\u2019s hard to watch Seann when Katya is nailing this character so brilliantly. His frame appears to be a bit loose and his timing a bit iffy, but Katya\u2019s choreography is winning the day and Seann might as well not be there. So Katya is dressed as a terrifying wind-up doll, whilst Seann is wearing zombie lederhosen. This is a basically a snuff version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which it not a movie niche that ever needed filling. It\u2019s time for SEANN AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018I Put A Spell On You\u2019 by Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins. This is the original version of this incredible song, capturing that time Katya cast a pub cider magic spell over Seann that rendered him unable to breathe. Thankfully she knew mouth-to-mouth and it was all fine, phew. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Ashley and Pasha. They still won\u2019t win, mind. Tricks and treats reference - DRINK! Bruno thought it was astonishing - one of the best Strictly moments of the season. Craig though it was swivelicious, and Darcey agrees - great details, and she loved it. Shirley thought it was one of the best choreographed routines she\u2019s ever seen. Tens all round, anyone? Poor Pasha and his giant belly. I still have no idea who he\u2019s supposed to be, but Ashley looks like Katie Perry in a puffball dress I\u2019d have paid very good money for in 1987. Well this all kinds of bonkers, but it\u2019s a great Charleston from Ashley. She\u2019s the consummate performer, as you would expect, and this kind of dance is right up her street. Great fun, fab footwork from Ashley. Ooh, Scherz is in the audience! Next up it\u2019s ASHLEY AND PASHA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Witch Doctor; by Don Lang. I have high hopes for this \u2013 Ashley doesn\u2019t do anything by halves and I fully expect her to deliver precision swivel. Ah, I\u2019ve missed Pasha\u2019s acting. If he was any more wooden I\u2019d carve him into a bookend in the shape of a woodpecker. Scores: 6,8,7,9 - a total of 30 for Danny and Amy. Really? Shirley\u2019s already mentioning Blackpool, which is a bit previous. She liked the lift, but the footwork was a bit bumpy along the way. Bruno thought Danny was flying high, but Craig thought it lacked grace and needed smoothing out. Darcey loved how Danny has softened his knees, but it needed more care coming out of the lifts. Fog! DRINK! Sadly (or not) it means we can\u2019t see Danny\u2019s feet, or in fact anything below the knee. This is rather odd - the music is making it feel a bit skippy, but I\u2019ve never been entirely sure what constitutes an American Smooth. Not my favourite dance of Danny\u2019s, just a bit...ordinary. I am unmoved. Next up it\u2019s DANNY AND AMY! Tonight they\u2019re dancing an American Smooth to \u2018Spirit In The Sky\u2019 by Doctor and the Medics. Technically this is a Norman Greenbaum song, but Doctor and the Medics did a considerably more weird version in the 1980s. It doesn\u2019t shout \u2018American Smooth\u2019 to me, but nothing is off limits this week. Scores: 4,6,5,5 - a total of 20 for Kate and Aljaz. I really don\u2019t think that deserved the same marks as Ranj\u2019s Jive. Darcey saw glimmers of desire, but Kate needed to use full extension of her arms. Shirley thought Kate\u2019s body needed more music, and expects more from Kate in the final detail in Week 6. Bruno thought Kate did her best but it needed more fluidity, and Craig wanted more resistance and tone in the body - currently Kate is using bits of it in isolation. So Kate and Aljaz are dressed as those living statues you see in Covent Garden, and they both look incredible. Kate is giving this her very best effort, and definitely has some movement in the hips and fluidity in the movement. Could do with a bit more emphasis and extension in the basics, but not the worst Rumba we\u2019ve ever seen. Actually kind of enjoyed that. Next up it\u2019s KATE AND ALJAZ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Rumba to \u2018Skin\u2019 by Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man. Skin isn\u2019t technically spooky unless it\u2019s hanging off, but I suppose we can allow this through on the \u2018bone\u2019 reference. Bit iffy, however, which by coincidence is also my current expectation of this Rumba. Please prove me wrong, Kate and Aljaz. Scores: 5,5,5,5 - a total of 20 for Dr. Ranj and Janette. Craig didn\u2019t love that, the costume was covering a multitude of sins. It was stompy and there were lots of timing issues. Darcey agrees there were lots of mistakes, Ranj got carried away with the character and it wasn\u2019t great. Shirley loved the concept and it started well, but Ranj lost his way. Bruno thought Ranj polished the floor beautifully, but he needs to avoid mistakes next week. So this has a kind of Monsters Inc. theme, which means Janette gets to be Boo in teeny pyjamas and Dr. Ranj is encumbered by a giant furry monster suit. I think he\u2019s Sully, but it\u2019s been many years since I saw this film. Awful lot of faffing about at the beginning of this, and once they get into some actual Jiving it\u2019s all kinds of awful. Ranj\u2019s timing is all over the place, not helped by wearing a massive feather duster and giant slippers. Oh dear. It\u2019s time for DR. RANJ AND JANETTE! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Monster Mash\u2019 by Bobby Pickett. I vaguely remember Dave Myers and Karen doing a Jive to this a few years back, and it was dreadful. Hopefully Ranjette can replace this memory with a bit more monster and considerably less mash. God these comedy VTs are terrible. It\u2019s my least favourite thing about Halloween Week. Incredibly tedious. Scores: 8,9,9,9 - a total of 35 for Stacey and Kevin. You can tell Stacey is trying really hard not to scream, but is failing badly. Bruno thought Stacey came back better than every - splendid styling and incredibly focussed. Craig thought it was a very strong performance - full of intent and purpose and Stacey is unstoppable. Darcey loved the attack and footwork, and the unique change of role at the end. Shirley thought the footwork was beautiful, and loved the control in the change of frame - just fantastic. Ooh, I like the bit with the clock, that\u2019s rather clever. This is a great Tango from Stacey, she\u2019s got some super footwork and is giving this plenty of attitude without overdoing it. Kevin is an incredibly good choreographer who brings out the best in her every time. That was brilliant, I loved it. Apparently for the first time ever, Stacey is leading some bits of this dance. Interesting, let\u2019s keep an eye out for that. Next up it\u2019s STACEY AND KEVIN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to the Doctor Who Theme. Stacey is The Doctor, because it\u2019s 2018 and this is perfectly fine now, and Kevin is a Cyberperson. Or possibly the Tin Man from The Wizard Of Oz, it\u2019s hard to tell. The main reason I never watched Doctor Who as a child is because I found the theme music intensely creepy and unsettling, not sure a Dave Arch Tango version is going to help much. But I\u2019m qualifying it as a Halloween song on this basis. Reading the terms and conditions - Moira Stewart in devil horns! I love her, she\u2019s a broadcasting legend. Scores: 4,5,6,6 - a total of 21 for Graeme and Oti. Do ghost scoring paddles count as ghost puns? Let\u2019s say they do, god knows I need a drink after that. Shirley was thrilled by some bits, mostly those out of hold. But the Cha Cha wasn\u2019t great, although she accepts the stiffer legs were part of his character (sure). Bruno thought it was tremendously horrendous, and a bit more Michael Flatfeet than Michael Jackson. Craig thought it was messy, flat footed and stiff hipped, but he loved the Thriller references. Darcey thought the moonwalk was the best bit, but everything else died. Graveyard fog! DRINK! I know zombies don\u2019t have Latin hips, but this is awfully stiff. He\u2019s fine in the Michael Jackson bits, but the limited amount of actual Cha Cha is dire. Oh dear, not Graeme\u2019s greatest effort, please don\u2019t make me watch that again tomorrow. First up tonight it\u2019s GRAEME AND OTI! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha to \u2018Thriller\u2019 by Michael Jackson. I have every expectation of this having very little actual Cha Cha and a great deal of zombie arms, but it\u2019s probably best to let it go sooner rather than later. Nobody watches Halloween Week for a faithful interpretation of the steps, all bets are off. Out come the stars! I\u2019m already anticipating a bunch of movie/TV references I won\u2019t get because I don\u2019t do horror or sci-fi. For example, why does Pasha look like one of those Mr Grasshead things you grow in your kitchen? I\u2019m depending on Tess to enlighten me. Out come the judges! Bruno\u2019s back from his travels, and they all look splendid. I want Darcey\u2019s wet-look cobweb dress right now, it\u2019s stunning. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess as Miss Scarlet, in the studio, with a paper shredder, Claudia in black velvet with giant buttons. Both rather fabulous. It\u2019s a theme week, so we get a bonus pro dance opening! It\u2019s a Day Of The Dead theme, which is the most bonkers zombie party ever. Mexico, via Hellstree. OK this is amazing, I love it. And we\u2019re off! Last week on Strictly: SO much dancing, including a banger of a Jive from Danny and Amy, and a very promising start to Couple\u2019s Choice. In the end we had to wave goodbye to Vick (sadly) and Graziano (less so). This week \u2013 HALLOWEEN! Gird your evil loins for crap acting, costume madness and absurd scoring. And VTs like this, which is just weird. First SPOOKTACULAR of the night, from the BBC continuity man. DRINK. Is it time yet? Darkness falls across the land... Ooh, I know this round on Pointless. a) Jerry Lee Lewis b) Whitney Houston c) Echobelly d) Take That e) Freddie Mercury If any of these guys on Pointless know c) I\u2019ll pickle my walnuts. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swig of some evil-tasting concoction for any occurrence of the following: The word \u201cspooktacular\u201d Ghost puns Random non-spooky music choices Reference to tricks and/or treats Graveyard fog Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing Halloween Special! Brace yourselves for an evening of quivering Quicksteps, chilling Cha Chas and frightful Foxtrots, plus plenty of spooky VTs and other standard Halloween fare. Traditionally the Strictly Halloween Special is a ghastly mess, happily trading dance integrity for a prop cupboard pile on and costume madness. But actually last year\u2019s was really good, and Movie Week a few weeks back was also great, so maybe Strictly is just getting better at pulling off a theme. I\u2019ll be here from 6.50pm to add some creepy tension to tonight\u2019s proceedings, whilst you are actively encouraged to get your freak on in the comment box below.
