Sophisticated, stunning, multilingual and with a head for business, she inhabited the avant-garde world of mid-century British art and design, shaping careers for others in fashion publishing and textile design, while balancing her own roles as trendsetter, wife and mother. She is best remembered for her formation in 1964 of Tamesa Fabrics, the source of expensive and exclusive cloths much loved by architects, which she ran until 1985, when it was sold to Osborne &amp; Little. Isabel was educated in Rome, where she was born to a Spanish painter father and an English mother. Isabel's adored husband, Hans, whom she married in 1941, was equally polycultural, and together they lived in Chelsea, with weekends in Sussex and jaunts to their flat in Rome. Isabel's career as a stylist began in the late 1930s at Elizabeth Arden, whose London salon was the only choice for the chic set. Spotted there, she was invited to work at wartime Vogue, where, it is said, she was responsible for snapping up Norman Parkinson, who began his employment there in 1945. His photograph of Isabel, wearing a hat by Hans, dates from this time. Also a fan and friend of Cecil Beaton, she supported progressive photography, including the work of Lee Miller, the US war correspondent whose post-liberation photographs of Paris were featured in the magazine Time off and a brief flirtation with Harper's in the early 1950s followed, but soon afterwards she was back with Vogue as a fashion editor. Throughout, she moved in the circle of progressive decorators and cutting-edge artists and designers, one of whom was her husband, with whose work she was always closely involved. Just prior to her death, she put together a retrospective of his work, currently showing at the Galerie V\u00f6mel in D\u00fcsseldorf. After 1956, her flair for talent spotting is more thoroughly documented. Alastair Morton sought her assistance in rebranding Edinburgh Weavers, the innovative offshoot of his family textile firm, Morton Sundour. For seven years (until Morton's death and the company's sale to Courtauld) she orchestrated a now celebrated range of printed and woven textiles. Among the artists she commissioned were Robert McGowan, Marino Marini, Alan Reynolds, William Scott, Victor Vasarely and the sculptor Elizabeth Frink. The striking publicity brochures that introduced each new range and credited the designers were also her doing. In 1963, as she began to construct Tamesa Fabrics, Isabel approached Marianne Straub, then a designer at Warner &amp; Sons and head of woven textiles at the Central School of Art and Design, to design the majority of woven fabrics for the new firm. Prints, including some by Hans, were included, but the focus was on subtle, beautifully textured and richly toned cloths. The first major order came from architect Howard Kenton, and soon afterwards, the Design Research Unit, an influential consortium of architects and designers headed by Milner Grey and Misha Black, were championing Tamesa's range. By 1968, Design, the magazine of the Design Council, declared that: \"For years, interest in furnishing textiles has been concentrated on printed designs. The work of Tamesa Fabrics has changed all this ...\" Already shipping fabrics internationally, Isabel enjoyed a success that was in part based on her delight in working with clients; among early projects were cloths for the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, British Airways' Trident, the QE2 liner, virtually all of the new British universities, and the British embassy in Paris. As further testament to her shrewd eye for trends, in 1970 the Tamesa showroom was relocated to London's World's End, making an early contribution to what is today the King's Road-Chelsea Harbour nexus of furnishing fabric showrooms. By now she was showing furniture by the likes of John Makepiece and Peter Latham, importing warp-printed silks from Korea, which were hers exclusively in Britain, and having cloths woven in Belgium. In 1976, she set up a Tamesa branch in Brussels. Isabel was always of the present, as informed on politics as on the arts. Outspoken and playful into her 90s, she is remembered by her twin daughters for her vivacious character, turning even an everyday meal into an elegant feast. \u00b7 Isabel Tisdall, fashion and textile stylist, born November 19 1911; died July 27 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
