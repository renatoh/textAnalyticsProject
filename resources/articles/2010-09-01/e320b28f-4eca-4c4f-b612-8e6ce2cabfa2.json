It is understood that the stocktake will allow Scudamore to gauge reaction to new rules introduced in the past 18 months partly in response to opaque takeovers and the financial meltdown at Portsmouth. They require clubs to provide future financial information, prove they are up to date with taxes, and places the onus on prospective new owners to prove they have the funds to deliver on their plans. He will also seek to discuss the impact of Uefa's financial fair play rules, which will essentially require clubs playing in Europe to break even from 2012-3. But the tour is also seen as a means of canvassing opinion on whether more should be done to save clubs from themselves \u2013 up to and including salary caps. Having argued vociferously against them in the past on the basis that they are a clumsy instrument that would damage English club's ability to compete in Europe, Scudamore's view is not believed to have changed. He has also argued that they would militate against the so-called \"dream factor\" \u2013 the ability of the likes of Fulham to challenge the established order. Only a handful of clubs are believed to be in favour. Cricket in a fix There was a gargantuan elephant in the room as the International Cricket Council's chief executives gathered in Cape Town yesterday. The match-fixing allegations that have dominated headlines around the world for two weeks were not on the agenda. But the topic that did dominate discussion \u2013 formalising the Future Tours Programme until 2020 and introducing \"context and content\" to world cricket, including the possibility of a one-day or Test match league and a Test play off \u2013 is directly related. The unstructured and bloated international cricket calendar has been cited by some as a potential contributory factor to spot-fixing and a key aim of the committee, which includes the ECB chief executive David Collier and will consider market research from England and elsewhere, is to ensure every match is meaningful. The meeting, which concludes today, is also likely to discuss Pakistan's future touring commitments. With the possibility of the team returning to England as a neutral home receding for obvious reasons, domestic Test grounds without any scheduled England action next year will be watching anxiously. Looking east Sport England, UK Sport and the Youth Sport Trust could all move to the Olympic Park in Stratford following the 2012 Games, Digger understands. It was announced in July that Sport England and UK Sport would merge in a bid to save back office costs. Although the timetable for the merger is still being consulted on, with no decision expected until the impact of next month's Comprehensive Spending Review on sports funding is known, the two bodies are unlikely to merge until after 2012. The increasingly favoured option would then to be move them from their expensive central London locations once their leases run out and house the two quangos \u2013 as well as the Youth Sport Trust \u2013 on the Olympic Park. On the wrong track It is the latest sign that when it comes to fear, loathing and paranoia, even English football politics still has a way to go to catch up with South Africa. An independent report from forensic investigators has found the South African Football Association admitted installing tracking devices on the vehicles of some of its most senior executives, including the organising committee chief executive Danny Jordaan, pictured, in the run up to last summer's World Cup. But the report commissioned by Leslie Sedibe, the SAFA chief executive who also had one of the devices attached to his car, found there was \"no malicious intent\". They were removed following complaints from the executives concerned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
