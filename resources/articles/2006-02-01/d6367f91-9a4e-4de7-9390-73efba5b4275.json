Dr Rath's publicity campaigns have persuaded people to take vitamin supplements instead of antiretroviral drugs. MSF and TAC say some have died. One libel suit - against a former education minister, Kadar Asmal, who also criticised Dr Rath - has not been dropped."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
