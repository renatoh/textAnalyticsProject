Lists of the nation's top celebrities are being scoured by PR consultants for names of glamorous stars. They must be young, beautiful and - most importantly - have a child young enough to ride in the latest, must-have, showbiz accessory: the pushchair. If you fit the bill - as Gwyneth Paltrow, Sophie Ellis Bextor and Sara Cox have done - you will be inundated with free samples of top toddler transport technology: the off-road buggy, the travel buggy, the lightweight buggy, the twin buggy and the buggy board to name but a few. And the reasons are not hard to understand. When Brooklyn Beckham was pushed around in the Teutonia Y2K, sales rocketed. The same happened when Sophie Wessex picked the Jane Matrix car seat, Liz Hurley landed on a double spread with a Maclaren and Kate Moss chose the Combi. And when Paltrow picked the exclusive Bugaboo Frog to push around baby Apple, the pram world went mad. Parents fled towards shops to pick up one for themselves, phone lines jammed with inquiries and sales soared. Hence manufacturers' burning desire to press their products on stars. This, after all, is the one piece of baby kit that a top actress or starlet can be seen and photographed with and feature in a tabloid spread. Just look at what Paltrow did for the Bugaboo Frog. 'Hits to the Bugaboo section of our website doubled overnight,' said Andrea Harrison, managing director of retailers Lullabys.co.uk. 'I had a woman come in with 13 weeks to go because she was afraid we would run out.' At one of Bugaboo's biggest outlets, Whizzy Wheels in Leicester, the reaction was the same. 'The Gwyneth effect has taken off,' says owner Angelique Warner-Neil. 'We know that for the next four weeks the Bugaboo will boom because of celebrity endorsements. It is because parents are older and more affluent so can afford to choose nice buggies. The pram says everything about a person. It says \"I have arrived.\"' The effect is so great that product placement has become a primary marketing tool And it is more than just Gwyneth. Moss's choice carried a border with an animal print and after she chose it Mothercare saw sales of a pushchair that just looked similar soar. The new exclusive buggy, the Stokke Xplory, has already been ordered by Bextor, Sara Cox and Kacey Ainsworth, East Enders' little Mo. 'Product placement and sending celebrity mothers-to-be buggies is important,' says Simon Hathway, European marketing manager for Maclaren. 'Once they are photographed then people who aspire to be like them want the same accessories.' Gaye Price-Jones, a PR consultant for PJP, which works predominantly in the mother and baby market says: 'We try to get the product out on television, fashion shoots and obviously with celebrities. Your pushchair is a fashion statement but the fact is celebrities will choose ones that not only look good but are good.' The parenting press has caught on and started running celebrity columns and pages dedicated to what celebrity mums own. 'All the companies send out masses of pushchairs,' says one PR agent who asked to remain unnamed. 'I was told that Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet got lots. But if you can afford the top-priced pushchair, you want it to be exclusive. It's like buying a Gucci coat - you don't want to bump into someone in the same one.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
