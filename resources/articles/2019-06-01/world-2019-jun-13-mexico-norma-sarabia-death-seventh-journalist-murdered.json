Norma Sarabia, a 46-year-old journalist who had reportedly received threats for denouncing police corruption, was gunned down on Tuesday night as she returned home in Huimanguillo, a city in the south-eastern state of Tabasco. \u201cShe was such a hard worker \u2026 she always liked to get to the news first,\u201d one close friend, Laurencio Palma, told the news website Animal Pol\u00edtico. Mexico\u2019s national human rights commission said Sarabia was the 149th Mexican journalist to be killed since 2000, making it one of the most dangerous countries on earth to be a journalist. In an article for Sarabia\u2019s newspaper, Tabasco Hoy, one colleague slammed the \u201cindolence and apathy\u201d with which politicians treated the slaughter of Mexican journalists. \u201cApparently the powerful care little about these murders,\u201d wrote the columnist Luis Antonio Vidal, the head of the local press association. Concern over the safety of another Mexican journalist \u2013 kidnapped just 12 hours after Sarabia\u2019s slaying \u2013 eased on Thursday after authorities in the eastern state of Veracruz announced he had been freed. Armed men reportedly seized editor Marcos Miranda Cogco on Wednesday morning, prompting fears he would become the week\u2019s second murdered journalist. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who is best known as Amlo, was praised for including pledges to respect freedom of expression and shun censorship in his inaugural address last December. \u201cWe must protect journalists, defend them and not kill them,\u201d he told reporters last month. But reports suggest 10 journalists have already lost their lives since he took office. Jan-Albert Hootsen, the Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said he saw few indications meaningful steps were being taken to halt the killings. \u201cOne of the major differences between Mexico and Turkey or China or Russia is that there is no concerted effort from the federal government to silence critical reporters here. There is no politics of repression from this president. But there is definitely a lack of commitment to solving the real issues, which are crime, violence, impunity and corruption.\u201d A record nine Mexican journalists were murdered in 2017, only for that record to be broken in 2018 with 10 killings, according to the CPJ. Sarabia\u2019s murder \u2013 at least the seventh this year \u2013 means that record is again likely to be broken in 2019. \u201cI hate to talk about numbers because we are talking about people but \u2026 if nothing changes we will end up with 12, 13, maybe even 14 murdered journalists. It just doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d The most notorious recent killing was that of Javier Valdez, a crusading editor famed for documenting the human cost of Mexico\u2019s drug war. Valdez was shot dead in 2017 and his suspected killer arrested last year \u2013 but activists say nearly all such murders go unsolved and unpunished. \u201cThe number one issue we are dealing with in Mexico is impunity. The impunity rate for regular crimes is about 90% and with crimes against reporters \u2013 especially lethal ones \u2013 it is almost 100%\u201d Hootsen said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
