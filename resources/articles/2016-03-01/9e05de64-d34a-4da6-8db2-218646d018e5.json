Carson, a gay man, was killed by Morales on 17 May 2013 after a brief verbal dispute in New York\u2019s West Village neighborhood. The second degree murder charge, with the hate crime designation, carries a prison term of life without parole. The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for just over one day before reaching their verdict. \u201cI feel like I got justice for my nephew,\u201d said Florence Bupurs, Carson\u2019s aunt who attended much of the emotional two-week trial. Speaking on behalf of the family, she said that \u201ceven if I don\u2019t feel like [the verdict] is enough, it will have to be enough ... It\u2019s closure\u201d. Adding to the drama of trial, which spanned several weeks, was the fact that Morales, 36, was deemed fit to represent himself after rejecting four public defenders assigned to him by the court. For Carson\u2019s supporters this meant not just having to be in the same courtroom as Morales, but having to listen to him examine witnesses each day. It also meant for Carson\u2019s friend Danny Robinson, who was with Carson at the time he was shot, having to answer questions posed by his friend\u2019s killer. \u201cYou could have avoided all of this from escalating to the level it did if you and Mr Carson just went along with your own business?\u201d Morales asked Robinson on the first day of testimony. \u201cThat is so offensive,\u201d Robinson responded, as the prosecution objected. Robinson was visibly shaken after the testimony. Robinson testified that the encounter began when Morales walked past the two men calling them \u201cfaggots\u201d and \u201cqueers\u201d, at one point saying: \u201cYou look like gay wrestlers.\u201d Surveillance footage shown to the jury appears to capture this exchange, with Robinson and Carson choosing to come back to Morales and confront him after his aggressive comments. During closing arguments, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said that the slurs Morales allegedly used are an example of \u201chow a killer dehumanizes the target of his anger\u201d, adding that to Morales, \u201cMark Carson was nothing but a sub-human faggot\u201d. Several witnesses testified that a verbal altercation between the men ensued after the comments. All three went around the corner where Morales pulled out a gun and shot Carson once in the face before fleeing on foot. A forensic pathologist testified during the trial that Carson would have been killed instantly by the shot. During his closing remarks to the jury last week, Morales said the shooting \u201cwas not a deliberate act. It was moreso a reaction to a perceived threat on my life\u201d, adding: \u201cMr Carson reached into his right pocket and retrieved what appeared to be a gun and I reacted to that.\u201d No other witness recalled seeing Carson with a gun, and none was recovered on the scene. Robinson said that the only reaching Carson did was to retrieve his cell phone to call 911. When he took the stand in his own defense, Morales testified that he did not aim his gun at Carson but instead turned around to run, firing as his arm flailed out. Police officer Henry Huot, who captured Morales after the shooting, testified that Morales pointed his gun at the officer before \u201cfumbling\u201d it on the ground. This was the basis for charging Morales with \u201cmenacing a police officer\u201d , which the jury also convicted him of. Huot said he tackled Morales, and once on the ground Morales said \u201che thought he was tough and I shot him\u201d. Huot also said that to him Morales sounded \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cdemonic\u201d the way he was laughing. The jury was played cellphone video of Morales immediately after being captured in which he can be heard saying \u201cI fucking shot him, he\u2019s dead\u201d while badly slurring his words. Morales cackles and can be seen licking the pavement before his mood suddenly shifts and he begins cursing at the arresting officers and refusing to speak further. Morales testified and later reiterated during his closing arguments that he did not remember any of the behavior portrayed in the video, attributing it to \u201cfear, shock, trauma, or all of the above\u201d. Morales also argued that he was too intoxicated to act rationally, claiming he had consumed about 10 drinks the night of of the incident. As part of his defense, Morales, who insisted throughout the trial that he was not a bigot, called a transexual woman to the stand to testify that the two had been engaged in a sexual relationship in the past. The court allowed the woman to testify from behind a sheet and under the pseudonym Jane Smith to protect her identity. While Smith was on the stand, Morales told jurors that \u201cI consider myself trisexual, bisexual \u2013 multiple,\u201d adding during closing arguments: \u201chow do you prosecute someone for a hate crime and you never even question their sexual orientation?\u201d Prosecutor Lucey asked jurors not to be swayed by Morales\u2019 expressed sexual orientation. \u201cWhat you should take away from this witness is that the defendant never walked with her in public, never brought her home to meet his family,\u201d Lucey said, adding that Morales had \u201cself-loathing\u201d issues and \u201chad a problem with proud open gay men\u201d. Early on, in an attempt to build the case for a hate crime, the prosecution asked jurors to consider testimony about an incident from earlier in the evening where Carson allegedly used homophobic slurs towards the employees of the Annisa Restaurant after being asked to stop urinating on the street in front. Several restaurant employees testified Morales came into the restaurant and repeatedly asked if certain employees were \u201cfaggots\u201d before flashing a gun. The restaurant is located just a few hundred feet from the historic Stonewall Inn, the symbolic launching point of the modern LGBTQ rights movement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
