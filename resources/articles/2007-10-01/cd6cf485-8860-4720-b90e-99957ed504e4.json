Very slowly, that lopsided balance has been changing over the past three years. Londoners' share has fallen by 6 per cent. But according to the postcodes of a million Eurostar travellers, only about 4 per cent come from the Midlands, 2 per cent from the north-east and even fewer from the north-west. Eurostar's hope is that next month's launch of its faster service from the new London terminus at St Pancras will change all that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
