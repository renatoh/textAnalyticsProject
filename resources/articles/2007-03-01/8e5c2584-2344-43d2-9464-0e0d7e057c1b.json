Manchester United supporters are not exactly famous for worrying about England in any case and neutrals will know better than to expect excitement from Tel Aviv on Saturday week. Middlesbrough went a goal down, recovered to take a 2-1 lead, then were denied their day of glory when a penalty was harshly awarded against them. This was another lucky escape for United in other words, who remain on course for a possible Treble despite losing players and their form of a few months ago. However, their injury problems are deepening on a daily basis. Edwin van der Sar had to cry off with a calf strain sustained while warming up, so Tomasz Kuszczak was hastily promoted from the bench and Chris Eagles sent to sit with the substitutes, leaving the visitors without a recognised goalkeeper in reserve. Kuszczak was in action straight away, making a save to deny Stewart Downing after the England winger's run behind the United defence had been superbly picked out by an inch-perfect pass from Julio Arca. On the ground where he won a highly contentious penalty in the league three months ago, Cristiano Ronaldo's every touch brought resounding boos, treatment that merely encouraged the winger to increase the quotient of dummies and step-overs. This in turn resulted in him being clattered by a combination of Lee Cattermole and Stuart Parnaby, though it was the confusion caused by Ronaldo swapping from the right wing to the left - as advertised by a song from United's travelling support - that led to the opening goal. Gabriel Heinze did well to tidy up in defence after Nemanja Vidic was nearly caught out, and even better to continue his run to launch an attack. Boro had no one marking Ryan Giggs when he popped up in the middle, and when he played a simple ball forward to Wayne Rooney instead of the expected one out to Ronaldo, the defence continued to stand off until it was far too late and the striker's crisply struck shot was nestling in Mark Schwarzer's bottom right corner. That was the signal for United to relax and gradually assume control, or it should have been. They almost increased their lead when a Giggs volley struck the base of a post, though they were once again indebted to Kuszczak for a fine one-handed save when Yakubu turned smartly from a throw-in and produced a shot on target from just inside the box. Boro were not doing much attacking, but that was a reminder of their potency in front of goal. When Rio Ferdinand and Kuszczak went for the same Downing cross on the stroke of the interval, the centre-half reaching the ball but leaving his goalkeeper stranded, Boro knew exactly how to take advantage. Arca headed the ball back into the danger area for Cattermole to control, turn and shoot in the same movement, finding the empty net with Kuszczak still trying to get back into position. If an equaliser was not what United wanted to see, neither was Henrik Larsson marking his last game for the club with a booking for diving just before half time. Whatever Sir Alex Ferguson said in the dressing room was redundant 90 seconds into the second half, because that was all the time it took for Boro to take the lead. Downing did a decent impersonation of Ronaldo by winning a corner with a cross from the left, then turning up to take it from the right. In both cases the delivery was excellent, with Kuszczak forced to flap at the first one and the second floating over an entire six-yard box full of defenders and landing square on the forehead of the completely unmarked George Boateng at the far post. As with Boro's first goal, questions could be asked about United's organisation at the back, but this time there was no question of the substitute goalkeeper being to blame. For a good 10 minutes the Treble was off, United were not going to grace the new Wembley and Gareth Southgate could be safely crossed off the list of managers worried about where Sven-Goran Eriksson might be turning up next. Then, for the second Saturday in succession, fortune smiled on 'lucky United' (copyright J Mourinho). To be more accurate fate turned its back on Boateng, who could consider himself decidedly unlucky to concede a penalty for handball. Rob Styles, the referee, was right on the spot when Giggs swung over a corner and will doubtless argue there was contact and intent need not come into it, but Boateng could hardly even have seen the ball coming as Ferdinand was standing right in front of him before ducking down at the last minute to attempt a back header. Ronaldo cemented his lasting unpopularity in these parts by gratefully accepting the opportunity to score from the spot. Mark Viduka and Yakubu had chances before the end, but United were not going to slip up three times. Boro will do well to get as close at Old Trafford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
