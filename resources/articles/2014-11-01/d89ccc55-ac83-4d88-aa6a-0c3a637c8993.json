Van Persie, the outstanding footballer in the Premier League two seasons ago, managed only 13 touches of the ball when United won 2-1 against his former club, Arsenal, last Saturday, leading to Van Gaal substituting him after 75 minutes. Radamael Falcao\u2019s return from injury puts Van Persie\u2019s place under pressure for Saturday\u2019s game at home to Hull City but the Colombian has not played for five weeks and it is James Wilson, an 18-year-old \u201cknocking on the door\u201d, who is more prominently in Van Gaal\u2019s thoughts. \u201cWe shall see tomorrow,\u201d Van Gaal said to the question of whether he would be confident enough to start the teenager. \u201cYou shall see if I give him that confidence.\u201d Van Gaal has previously excused himself from discussing Van Persie by saying it is not his policy to talk about the form of individual players. On this occasion, there was no such protection for the striker on the back of his peripheral performance against Arsenal, when the 31-year-old had the fewest number of touches in any match for over 10 years by a United player who has been on the pitch for at least 75 minutes. No other top division player, including goalkeepers, has had so few touches in a game this season. \u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cI had a striker, an international striker, Mario Gomez, who touched the ball nine times in matches at Bayern Munich in my time. But I do think 13 is [too] few for a striker. You can count his touches of the ball. \u201cThe more important thing is how he is playing. It was a very bad game from him and that is why I changed him. When I change a player it is not because he is the best player on the pitch, or then I would be doing something wrong. When I change players it is normally because they are doing something not good in their performance.\u201d Van Gaal did go on to point out Van Persie was bound to be isolated in a game Arsenal dominated until half-time. \u201cWhen you pick up this match it is easy to put the question. Thirteen touches of the ball? Yeah, OK . . but strikers do not often touch the ball, that is their profession.\u201d The manager\u2019s suspicion, however, is Van Persie has lost self-belief after not being able to maintain the prodigious level of performance that helped United to the championship in Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s final season. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of confidence, maybe a question of scoring a wonderful goal at the right moment,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cIt can be tomorrow. You know how strikers are: they have to score goals. They feel like that; it\u2019s not that I\u2019m asking that. I have said to them: \u2018You have to be at an attacking point, you have to help our team come and search for space \u2013 for me, it is not important who is scoring.\u2019\u201d The win against Arsenal elevated Van Gaal\u2019s team to fourth position but the manager does not believe it was a turning point for his first season. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cThe performance was not the performance, I think, that shall give us a lot of confidence. The performance was not the performance I had in mind but the fighting spirit was unbelievable. We didn\u2019t perform well and we have to improve that. When we win with a good performance it will give us much more confidence than a good result against Arsenal.\u201d Van Gaal, confirming that Luke Shaw will be out with ankle ligament damage for \u201ca few weeks\u201d, hopes Marcos Rojo can return to his squad against Hull and he went on to talk about what he perceived as a lack of leadership in his team. \u201cAt this moment it is difficult to say one is the leader. But I don\u2019t think leaders are so important. I have not experienced a lot of leaders in my teams, not in Bayern Munich, not in Barcelona, not in Ajax. At Ajax, I had [Danny] Blind and later Rijkaard. At Barcelona, I made Guardiola captain. At Bayern Munich, I had Philipp Lahm and Schweinsteiger. It is not so easy, leadership, and you can be a leader the wrong way. So it\u2019s not so important.\u201d That was still a slightly strange admission given that he made Van Persie his captain during Holland\u2019s run to the World Cup semi-finals. Yet the message here was Van Persie could no longer consider himself an automatic starter, especially now Falcao is nearing full fitness. \u201cEvery player in my selection has to fight for his position,\u201d Van Gaal said, adding that he hoped Falcao could re-establish himself as one of the top strikers, on the basis \u201cwe have him on loan because of that\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
