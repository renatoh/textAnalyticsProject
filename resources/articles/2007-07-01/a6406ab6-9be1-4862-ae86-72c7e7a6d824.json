That and the voluble swearing make this the Wii's first grown-ups only game, no doubt a selling proposition not lost on marketing. Following last year's release on PS2, Xbox and PC, the Wii version suffers badly from lack of a conventional joypad with aiming and just about everything else feeling uncompromisingly clunky, making its Grand Theft Auto-lite play mechanics even less fun. Although not as awful as most film licensed games and with some amusing dialogue and a voice actor who does a very passable Al Pacino, Scarface is a crude simulacrum of Rockstar's classic series. \u00b7 Vivendi, \u00a340 Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six PS3 Like ordering a coffee-style beverage from Starbucks, when playing a Rainbow Six game, you know what to expect, which is a wafer-thin plot about terrorists; a small team of Special Forces soldiers at your mildly tactical command; and a difficulty level keen to mete out death at every turn. Vegas has one key difference: you'll live an awful lot longer thanks to its munificently forgiving health system that requires you to find some cover after you've been hit. A few seconds later you're ready to rejoin the global war on terror. The absurdly clumsy under-door camera and slightly dowdy visuals aside, this is without doubt the most accessible and balanced Rainbow Six outing yet, even if it's not quite up to the standard of its verbosely entitled Ubisoft stable mate game, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2. \u00b7 Ubisoft, \u00a340 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix Nintendo DS Everyone's favourite speccy wizard is back again in his ongoing campaign to off Voldemort and survive school. In videogame terms this translates to a lot of traipsing around the appropriately labyrinthine corridors of Hogwarts interspersed with magic lessons, wand-based fights with fellow pupils and various mini-games, none of which you'd seek out as a game on its own. Trying too hard to mimic its console big brothers' exploration heavy gameplay ends in a mess of fake-3D environments and fixed camera angles, which, along with a uniquely irritating (but vital) pointing hand that's supposed to tell you where you're going, make for an unfocused and dreary experience from the start. The plot is barely sketched in, lessons are mostly unrewarding and the whole thing is patronisingly easy, which combine to make this feel more like a boring but very straightforward set of chores than entertainment. \u00b7 Electronic Arts, \u00a330"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
