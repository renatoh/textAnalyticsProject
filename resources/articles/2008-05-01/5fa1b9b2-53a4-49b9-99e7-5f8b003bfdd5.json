Notebook knows of two of them who resigned because the RSA is to sponsor an academy. Now comes news of discontent over his Charter for 21st Century Education, designed, it says here, \"to express the vision for the nature and purpose of schooling\". As the language suggests, the consultation document \"reeks of New Labour\", according to one of the fellows. \u00b7 Notebook last spotted Don Foster, Liberal Democrat spokesman on culture, media and sport, and once their education spokesman, at the 60s disco at Keele University's Pioneers Reunion for 60s graduates last week. The 1969 Keele graduate asked the DJ to play the Rolling Stones' Brown Sugar. Seeing a youthful female student rivalling his own celebrated Mick Jagger impersonation, Foster shouted across to her: \"Do you know Brown Sugar?\" \"Yes,\" she shouted back. \"Me mum sings it.\" \u00b7 The Guardian's revelation that Ofsted inspectors might soon be judging schools in England on pupils' wellbeing and happiness, meaning they would have to keep records of pregnancy rates and drug problems, sparked frantic rebuttal efforts by Ofsted and the Department for Children, Schools and Families to keep the story from spreading to radio and other papers. But they could hardly deny the document setting out these ideas, or the fact that it had been discussed by the New Relationships with Schools group - some of whom were extremely positive, we hear. Besides, the logic of creating Ed Balls's new department is that the lives of children inside and outside school are going to be treated as a seamless whole. Happiness inspections sound impossibly bonkers, but headteachers are taking the threat seriously. \u00b7 Just as education initiatives never just begin, they are always kickstarted, so conference organisers constantly try to make their agendas sound exciting and edgy. So the serried ranks of suits at the Independent Schools Council next month can feel just a little untamed and wild at heart as they listen to the opening address entitled Riding the Storm Facing Education UK. Will the speaker, Dame Judith Mayhew Jonas, leap on to the stage to the sound of heavy metal or, given the age group of many of the audience, the Doors intoning Riders on the Storm? Perhaps not, though it would raise expectations for the breakout sessions: the venue, it should be noted, is the Brewery in London, and while the ISC is certainly capable of organising a piss-up there, that probably won't be happening either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
