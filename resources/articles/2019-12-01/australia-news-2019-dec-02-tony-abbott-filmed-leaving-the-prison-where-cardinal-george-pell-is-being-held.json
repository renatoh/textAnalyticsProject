Abbott was filmed leaving the Melbourne Assessment Prison on Monday morning by a Seven News crew, but refused to confirm exactly who in the jail he was visiting. \u201cLook, I was simply visiting a friend, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Abbott, who then ignored a question about \u201cwhat sort of spirits\u201d Pell was in, before stepping into a vehicle. Abbott said in February that he telephoned Pell, a friend and mentor, after it was first revealed Pell had been convicted of child abuse offences. The former senator Derryn Hinch said on Twitter that Abbott\u2019s visit to the prison on Monday was a \u201cdisgrace and a cruel insult to his victims\u201d. In March, Pell was sentenced to six years in jail after being convicted of sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in 1996. The former Liberal prime minister John Howard wrote a character reference for Pell after he was convicted for child sexual abuse. Australia\u2019s highest court has agreed to refer Pell\u2019s case to the full bench of the high court to hear appeal arguments. That hearing won\u2019t be held until at least March 2020. Attempts to reach Abbott on Monday night for further comment were unsuccessful. with Australian Associated Press"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
