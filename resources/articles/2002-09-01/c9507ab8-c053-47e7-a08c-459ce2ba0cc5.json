With West Ham at the bottom of the table and without a win all season, Di Canio was reported in one newspaper to have launched a tirade at Roeder during the defeat by Tottenham on September 15. Di Canio, who has since said he was issuing a war cry to his manager, has not been an automatic first choice this season. After initially voicing his concerns about the appointment of Roeder last season, his actions were claimed to be a further blow to team morale. \"They're trying to ruin me, but they won't succeed,\" said Di Canio in the new Italian sports daily Contro Campo. \"I'm furious, out of my mind. After half an hour of the second half, I took a free-kick which resulted in an equaliser. \"Crazy with joy, I ran towards Roeder and shouted at him 'It's for you, Glenn.' \"Four minutes later Roeder substituted me and I left amid applause and I embraced him. That's all. \"And what do I read the day after in the newspaper? I read 'Di Canio argues with Roeder because he substitutes him.' In England they massacre you with a headline, then apologise in small type. \"In first place in the list of infamy, there's the Sun, followed by the Daily Express, the Mirror, the News of the World and the Daily Mail.\" Di Canio first attracted controversy when he pushed over the referee Paul Alcock after being given his marching orders during a game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal. But he believes the English press are too negative and that their personal attacks on England managers are often overly critical. \"On a personal level they've murdered people like Keegan and Hoddle, legends of English football,\" Di Canio added. \"And look at what's happening to Eriksson. They can't bear it that a foreigner is in charge of the national team and doing a good job.\" Di Canio, who was last year urged by Lazio fans to join the club he had supported as a boy, has only a year left on his contract but admitted he is undecided about his future. \"Who knows? I've never hidden my love for Lazio, and everybody knows I'd love to move closer to Terni where my parents live, but they also know that I could stay at West Ham. Here the fans love and respect me.\" The Nigerian defender Joseph Yobo is set to return to competitive action for Everton tomorrow in a reserve match against Manchester City. The \u00a31m buy from Marseille has been sidelined with an ankle injury picked up in training. The Crystal Palace manager Trevor Francis will not face criminal charges following an incident involving the goalkeeper Alex Kolinko last month. The Latvian was struck by Francis after Bradford City scored against Palace; Francis said he saw his player laughing on the sidelines. Francis tried to brush the matter off as a harmless joke, but Kolinko, who denied laughing, claimed he was punched. But the police have now decided not to take the matter further."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
