Apparently she said the same thing in Liverpool. \"You forget where you are on these long tours,\" she explains. Still, if anyone can be forgiven such a geographical howler, it is her - the last touring Staple Singer and veteran civil-rights campaigner, who launches into Eyes On the Prize by promising \"enough inspiration and vibrations to last you six months\". The voice once described as \"joy and thunder\" is a low, throaty gurgle now, but when her 68-year-old chops soar into the choruses, her ample bosom swells with so much passion and indignation that you fear for the front rows. These days, Staples is as much a walking encyclopaedia of the struggle as a singer, and when she trots out the story of black children being spat on and stoned while trying to board an Arkansas schoolbus in 1960, it's still as haunting and disturbing as Why Am I Treated So Bad?, the Staples Singers song inspired by the event, which she reveals was Martin Luther King's favourite. A break for the band to twang away allows her to take a breather, though Respect Yourself sounds sluggish and I'll Take You There loses something as a clap-along. With most songs and anecdotes dating from the 1960s, there could perhaps be more made of struggles continuing today. But even though We Shall Not Be Moved - once sung in defiance of the policemen clearing black people from restaurants - seems to last as long as 1964, when she says she'll continue to March Up Freedom's Highway \"until Dr King's dream is realised\", it is hard not to feel humbled as her mission carries on. \u00b7 At Colston Hall, Bristol, tonight.
