The five-match series begins on 25 February \u2013 12 days after Stokes is due at Bristol Magistrates to face a charge of affray. Following his court date on 13 February, Stokes is due to fly out to New Zealand to join the Twenty20 squad in the Trans-Tasman Tri-series. After the fifth ODI at Perth, where England secured a 12-run win over Australia to take the Gillette ODI series 4-1, the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, said he expected the all-rounder to leave for New Zealand \u201cthe next day or two\u201d after his court appearance. Stokes\u2019s inclusion means there is no place for Middlesex\u2019s Dawid Malan, who was drafted into the squad for the recently completed series with Australia as cover for the all-rounder. The ECB had hoped Stokes would be able to play some part in the series until the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s investigations continued into the third week of January. A potential comeback was then pushed back to the T20 series. The Nottinghamshire seamer Jake Ball has also been omitted. The return of Stokes will not only help him get up to speed before the two-match Test series with New Zealand that follows \u2013 his last competitive match was on 22 December 2017 for Canterbury \u2013 but it will also put pressure on players in the XI. Bayliss, while stating earlier in the week that Stokes would not automatically regain his starting place, hopes his presence will light a fire under those who need to do more. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem. Everyone knows he is coming back in the team at some stage and that keeps everyone on their toes to make sure they are not the ones who get pushed aside when he comes back.\u201d With the squad announcement, the chairman of selectors James Whitaker, said: \u201cOn behalf of the England selectors I\u2019d like to congratulate head coach Trevor Bayliss and captain Eoin Morgan on their victory in the Gillette ODI series over Australia. Our ODI side has made excellent progress over the last three years and it\u2019s encouraging to see with the 2019 World Cup on the horizon. We\u2019re sure to encounter strong opposition in New Zealand but it\u2019s another opportunity for the team to test themselves and to continue playing entertaining cricket.\u201d England\u2019s 15-man squad for the ODI series against New Zealand Eoin Morgan (Middlesex) (Capt), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Tom Curran (Surrey), Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), Ben Stokes* (Durham), David Willey (Yorkshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham) *Ben Stokes\u2019s involvement is subject to any court obligations in relation to the incident in Bristol in September and his travel arrangements are yet to be confirmed.
