The designer is known for her pro-animal, anti-fur stance, so how did such a blunder happen? \"Stella went absolutely ballistic\", reported the Mail on Sunday, and threatened to sue the high-end Mayfair boutique. Now the ad, which ran in Vogue, has been dropped. Quite right too: the bra was lent for an editorial shoot, but mistakenly used for the advertisement. Whoops. Asos bags Matt &amp; Nat However, Stella can console herself with some shopping on Asos (admittedly an unlikely image). They've just started stocking one of our favourite designers - Canadian accessories line Matt &amp; Nat. The range includes a gorgeous deep pink clutch and silvery-grey bag. They're both part of the brand's Japanese paper range - we strongly recommend you check out the full Matt &amp; Nat range, which is great for presents for both men and women. Why is it suitable for Stella? Sorry, we nearly forgot - they're all vegan. All wrapped up Dedicated eBayers and fashionistas will already have noted the arrival of the latest Celia Birtwell collection at Topshop. The previous collections have all been big hits, and with 60s-inspired floral dresses and blouses amongst the new numbers, this one looks set to be no exception. We particularly like the very wearable wrap dress Back to black Meanwhile, next door at Topman, it's back to basics. The menswear store has been running a series of projects with designers reinventing the classics - now it's the turn of the black trousers. We're not sure quite how you redefine such a wardrobe staple without going too wacky, but with top designers like Ann-Sofie Back and Todd Lynn amongst those involved, it will be interesting to see what they do to reinvent the wheel. And \u00a365 for 100% wool plus a designer name is a good price, come to that. School's in for summer \"Clothes for girls who wish they'd been sluts in high school\" is how young designer Natascha Stolle describes her vision. Hmmm. Not sure we particularly like that as a creative principle, but it must be resonating somewhere, because Stolle has just been snapped up by London fashion week's top emerging talent show, Fashion East. Only a year on from her MA at Central Saint Martins, expect to see Stolle mixing teenage sensuality with more sophisticated chic on next month's catwalk. And on a related note ... Feeling bereft now that Gossip Girl's preppy, Marc Jacobs look has vanished from your \u2013 ahem - little sister's TV screen? Never fear - more guilty teen entertainment arrives this week with movie release Wild Child (Aug 15). Channelling a west coast fashion obsession fit to rival that of Park Avenue princess Blake Waldorf, 16-year old Poppy is shipped off from LA to English boarding school for bad behaviour. We know we're old enough to know better, but we can't resist a peek at the wardrobe of this high-maintenance miss. Wardrobe hitch-ed Fashion faux pas seem to be the theme of the week. The most shocking revelation from Peaches Geldof's surprise wedding in Las Vegas (only the elder Geldof daughter could possibly adopt Britney as a role model) is not the suddenness of the nuptials nor the fact that no one even knew she was dating the guy - including, according to some sources, her didn't-know-he-was-ex-boyfriend. No it was - prepare yourselves - the fact the groom kept his sunglasses on throughout. Presumably this was to indicate just how cool he is. The Rev Steven Fabretti, who joined the happy couple in holy matrimony, was less impressed. \"I remember thinking it strange to wear sunglasses inside the chapel. They held hands and looked eye-to-eye - with him still wearing sunglasses - during the ceremony.\" We can only hope they were Ray Ban Wayfarers. \"They looked very happy together. I remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic,\" concluded the rather sweetly innocent Rev Fabretti."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
