Stars Catherine Tate and Mark Gatiss will be back together on the evening of the general election this Thursday to perform Graham\u2019s 2019 version, along with a full cast including Bill Paterson and Nina Sosanya, for one night only in central London. Election night parties are thin on the ground and many voters will be looking for distraction. Graham\u2019s play offers a compromise, since the playwright will be asked to read out the exit poll results the minute the play finishes at 10pm. \u201cIt is not your average Christmas show, but the peculiarly twee way we run elections in this country means that many polling stations are in the same places that carol concerts and nativity plays are being staged,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe wanted to bring people together and Josie and I also felt that the arts often departs too quickly from the political scene and just hands the baton to journalists and pundits.\u201d The play is again set in real time on the final 90 minutes of polling on election night in a marginal seat. In 2015, the original Donmar Warehouse production, labelled \u201ca glorious night at the polling station\u201d by the Observer, was broadcast live on More4 and nominated for a Bafta. \u201cWe enjoyed it so much the first time, we wanted to restage the whole exercise again,\u201d said Rourke. \u201cBut it was fascinating to see what had changed.\u201d The core mechanics of the play, its elements of farce, have endured, she added, because the key characters, the three clerks in the polling station and those who come in to vote, are limited in time and space. \u201cYet not only was the last time pre-European referendum, it was also at a time when people were still wondering about the possibility of a hung parliament and imagining what chaos that might bring,\u201d said Rourke this weekend ahead of the performance in the auditorium at Bush House on The Aldwych. \u201cJames is not looking to write a stinging political satire. He wants instead to be fair to all sides and so he remains hidden in the text.\u201d Graham agrees that the aim is to include people rather than divide them. \u201cIt is not all about Brexit this time, but of course it\u2019s there in the shadows, behind everything. It\u2019s why we are all here now. \u201cIn the 2015 version there was concern about the chaos that would come from a tight election result, with no majority. In the end, that didn\u2019t happen then, but we were still right because it was all to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
