Unfortunately, ours was demolished by our district council as it was on land sold to Tesco for a superstore. The council agreed \u00a380,000 compensation, which is nowhere near enough to provide alternative facilities. We have one football pitch for 15 or more teams, so several teams play away all season, and we have no indoor leisure facilities at all. But at least we do have a massive supermarket where the kids can race around the aisles. Sandra Semple Seaton, Devon \u2022 I couldn't disagree with Joe Anderson more (Letters, 1 January). Councils should certainly demand more money from the government. Banks have been given \u00a3350bn in quantitative easing and look where growth went. If local government had had a tenth of that to develop infrastructure and housing, we would be in a different position. Cllr Colin Challen Labour, Scarborough borough council \u2022 The new year has got off to a bad start. No Martin Kelner to look forward to on a Monday morning, in the Sport section. \"Que se passe-t-il?\" as Martin would ask. Pete Wedderburn Belfast \u2022 Re \"guys\" (Letters, 1 January): as a former children's TV producer and now a cub scout leader, I have discussed with groups of young people how they would like to be addressed. Boys and girls? Old-fashioned. Young people? Too formal. Posse? Not really. Squad or team? Irrelevant. Out of a poor selection, guys seems to be favourite, simply because most young people do not see it as applying only to the males. Martyn Day Twickenham, Middlesex \u2022 What's the matter with \"people\"? Cherry Lavell Cheltenham, Gloucestershire \u2022 The French should be lucky with a doubling of costs on their opera house (Report, 31 December). The first estimate for costs of Hamburg's Elbphilhamonie was \u20ac77m. Now they are at more than \u20ac575m. Finish date for the project, due to open in 2010, is now 2017.
