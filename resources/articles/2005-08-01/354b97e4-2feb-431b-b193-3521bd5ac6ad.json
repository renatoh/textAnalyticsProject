It's already won a clutch of design awards, including the prestigious US Industrial Design Excellence Awards, and we predict there are more to come. It was designed by cycling obsessive and environmentalist Errol Drew, who now lives in Bermuda but had London in mind when he developed the idea. In the Eighties, Drew ran bike shops in north London, importing the first mountain bikes to the UK. An early member of Friends the Earth, he organised Camden's first bicycle group to get everyone on their bikes. Given that only 2 per cent of people in the UK cycle to work, as opposed to 27 per cent in Holland, there's evidently still some work to be done, though the iXi might encourage the style-conscious. The idea was to make a bicycle 'visually appealing and user-friendly in the manner of other modern consumer durables. It should appeal to sophisticated consumers who might not normally venture into a traditional bike store.' This explains why the drinks holder doubles as an iPod holder. Additionally, there's a maintenance-free drive-belt system, replacing the traditionally oily chain to encourage novice cyclists worried about looking after their bikes. \u00b7 The iXi bike, \u00a3999, available to order from the Conran Shop (020 7589 7401)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
