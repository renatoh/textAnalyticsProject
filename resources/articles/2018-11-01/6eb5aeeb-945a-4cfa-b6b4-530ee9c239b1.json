The hashtag started after a patronizing tweet by the National Rifle Association, America\u2019s most influential gun rights group, and appears to have only grown in the week of violence that followed. \u201cThis hits close to home because I spent time at Mercy hospital during my residency,\u201d wrote Dr Sara Hurtado Bares, an infectious disease specialist in Nebraska. \u201cTime for the medical community to make our voices heard loud and clear. Enough is enough.\u201d \u201cToday in America,\u201d wrote Dr Mark Seamon, a professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThree mass shootings \u2013 one stemming from domestic violence, one barely making our local news.\u201d Seamon has also tweeted alerts using an acronym unlikely to be recognized outside of American emergency rooms: GSW. Gunshot wound. The \u201cindividual, grassroots\u201d movement, according to activists with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and other advocates,turned convention on its head. Healthcare professionals have been apprehensive about commenting on the hot button issue, fearing professional repercussions. \u201cPhysicians have been hesitant to speak out in the past because of concerns they would be suffer consequences at work,\u201d said Dr Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist. \u201cThe willingness to take on politically charged topics is definitely increasing,\u201d said Seamon. \u201cPreviously many physicians were hesitant to speak out about the horrors of what they saw on a daily basis. No more.\u201d \u201cI have told countless mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, wives, husbands, sons and daughters that their loved one is dead,\u201d he added. \u201cIt never, ever gets easier. But honestly, I don\u2019t want it to get easier \u2013 I want to not have to do it any more.\u201d The groundswell of #ThisIsOurLane followed a confluence of criticism and violence. Within the space of a few hours, the NRA criticized an American College of Physicians policy paper that appears in the Annals of Internal Medicine; a shooting in California killed 12 people in a bar; and Melinek tweeted en route to her second gunshot autopsy of the week: \u201cDo you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly?\u201d Melinek said physicians feared being seen as \u201crepresenting their agencies\u201d, offending hospital donors or turning off gun-owning patients. \u201cI\u2019ve had colleagues say to me, \u2018You\u2019re very brave\u2019, with concerns there would be consequences for me.\u201d In the week that followed, photos of emergency department staff holding #ThisIsOurLane signs have flooded Twitter. Doctors such as Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician at Rhode Island hospital held a \u201ctweetatorial\u201d to answer basic questions about gun violence. Among statistics she tweeted: 100 Americans are killed and 200 injured by firearms each day. Most of those people are white men in rural America who use firearms to kill themselves. About one-third of gun violence is concentrated among minority men in inner cities. Firearms deaths are the second-leading cause of death for American youths. The issue of deaths on such a scale, she argues, can be treated like motor vehicle crashes, which have seen an enormous decline in mortality. Already, nearly 40,000 healthcare workers have signed a letter calling for healthcare workers to \u201ccome together\u201d to address the epidemic. Longtime advocates for gun violence research, such as Dr Garen Wintemute, said the NRA\u2019s tweet tapped into a reservoir of pent-up emotion on the issue. \u201cPressure has built because with every mass shooting, there\u2019s an increasing sense of needing to do something,\u201d said Wintemute, whose website gives doctors resources for taking action. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really hoping is out of this will be a real surge in willingness to talk with patients about firearms, when it\u2019s relevant, and take action when the course of the conversation concludes action needs to be taken.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
