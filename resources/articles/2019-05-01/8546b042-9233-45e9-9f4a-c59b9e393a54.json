The Fairfax/Nine papers are using a striking image of Hawke, hands clasped on his walking stick, staring down the barrel of the camera. The portrait takes up the full front page of the Canberra Times, with just his name and the dates of his life, as well as a quote from Bill Shorten: \u201cThe Australian people loved Bob Hawke because they knew Bob loved them. This was true to the very end\u201d. The Age\u2019s headline also quotes Bill Shorten\u2019s tribute to Hawke: \u201c\u2018He knew he was loved, to the end\u2019\u201d and previews its obituary on the front, in which the former PM is described as \u201cLabor\u2019s golden boy who transformed a nation\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald calls him \u201cThe fearless reformer\u201d and says he was \u201cone of the nation\u2019s greatest public figures and a hero of the Australian Labor Party\u201d. The West Australian runs a portrait of Hawke smoking a cigar: \u201cHere\u2019s to Bob\u201d, is their headline, as the paper pays tribute to \u201cthe tough-talking, boozing larrikin who many rate our best prime minister\u201d. Under the headline \u201cSee ya mate\u201d, the Mercury in Tasmania celebrates Hawke\u2019s connection to their state, celebrating his work to save the Franklin River and featuring photographs of him on visits to Hobart in 1989 and 2012. The NT News also just has Hawke\u2019s name and dates on the front, and has chosen a photograph of the former prime minister, who was famous for his love and beer and ability to down it quickly, raising a glass. The Daily Telegraph shows Hawke, beer in hand, with his wife Blanche d\u2019Alpuget. Its headline is: \u201cLarrikin. Leader. Legend.\u201d The Courier Mail has the same photograph and headline but adds a line riffing on Hawke\u2019s famous comment about the America\u2019s Cup: \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t celebrate Hawkie\u2019s life today is a bum\u201d. The Advertiser calls him \u201cOne of a kind\u201d, and links the death to tomorrow\u2019s election. \u201cOn the eve of a likely return to power for his beloved Australian Labor Party, Bob bows out,\u201d says the paper. The Herald Sun runs a quote from Hawke\u2019s wife Blanche d\u2019Alpuget in which she called her husband a \u201cgreat Australian \u2013 many would say the greatest Australian of the postwar era\u201d under a striking photograph of the former prime minister and the headline \u201cLegend\u201d. The Australian headline is: \u201cFrom larrikin to legend\u201d and says the nation is mourning \u201cthe everyday man who rose to be the people\u2019s PM\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
