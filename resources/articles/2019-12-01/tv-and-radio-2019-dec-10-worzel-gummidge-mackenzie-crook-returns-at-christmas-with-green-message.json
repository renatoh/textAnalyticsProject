A children\u2019s television classic since Jon Pertwee portrayed him on ITV between 1979-81, Worzel, the nattily dressed scarecrow of ten acre field, has been rebooted for BBC One by the writer and actor Mackenzie Crook. Two lavishly made one-hour specials will be shown in prime slots over Christmas aimed at the whole family. Crook said he saw the character as a \u201cguardian of the natural world\u201d and the programmes were an opportunity to write something which was, he hoped, very funny but did have environmental messages. \u201cHopefully it is very subtly done, not in a preachy way. I don\u2019t want it to be annoying. \u201cKids are so on board with that [environmental] message at the moment, it\u2019s the adults that are catching up. It seemed natural,\u201d he said. The two episodes touch on the consequences of the climate crisis as well as plastic pollution. Crook said: \u201cIt seems to be the easiest, most visible thing we can start doing, just not using single-use plastic. I can see even in a year or two it will be banned and we won\u2019t be able to believe that we were able to use it.\u201d The programmes do have serious intent but they are also very daft and will appeal to both children and adults. Sir Michael Palin, who plays the Green Man, the creator of all scarecrows, saw the programmes as an \u201coasis of calm \u2026 it is also a lovely oasis to be in because it is warm and friendly and extremely silly\u201d. The programmes are markedly different in tone to so much that is on television at the moment, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually in your face, fast, high action, noisy \u2026 this is calm and you have to listen, take it in and I think the more TV like that the better, really, otherwise we\u2019re just getting everyone shouting for attention.\u201d The films will be shown in the evening on Boxing Day and on 27 December. The creatives who worked with Crook on his BBC Four show Detectorists have teamed up with him again for Worzel Gummidge. The cast includes Steve Pemberton and Rosie Cavaliero as a farming couple who take in two foster children and quickly learn there is more to the wooden scarecrow in the field than meets the eye. Zoe Wanamaker plays an eccentric aristocrat and Vicki Pepperdine plays Aunt Sally, which is a very different role to the one played by Una Stubbs 30 years ago. She is definitely not a love interest. Another difference is that Crook\u2019s Gummidge does not have interchangeable turnip and swede heads. He has one, which is made of wood. His brain is made from conkers. Worzel Gummidge was created in the 1930s by the novelist Barbara Euphan Todd and the first book was published in 1936. \u201cIt is an enduring story of fish-out-of-water kids who find a secret and magical friend who leads them on adventures,\u201d said Crook. The books are \u201cof their time but the world and the characters are still there so we brought it up to date and made our own stories\u201d. Crook said he hopes there will be more Gummidge to come. \u201cAdapting Barbara Euphan Todd\u2019s books into these two films has been a joy and I\u2019ve completely fallen for her charming, irreverent scarecrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
