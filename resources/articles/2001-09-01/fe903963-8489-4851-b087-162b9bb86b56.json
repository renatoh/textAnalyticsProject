But then a little flap. Gary Neville: 7/10 Another enterprising first half in tandem with Beckham. Like Cole he did not get as far forward as in Munich but was a useful outlet for England. Rio Ferdinand: 7/10 Looks as at ease as Scholes in possession and when asked to defend did so competently. Sol Campbel: 5/10 Not much activity, but again Campbell did not look totally comfortable. Tentative, but 87th minute goalline clearance will have boosted confidence. Ashley Cole: 6/10 Very little to do in defence but what he did was done efficiently. None of his forward sprints from Munich. Eriksson has maybe had a word. David Beckham: 8/10 Playing like a man inspired by responsibility. Faced with Albania's best player, Edvin Murati, Beckham worked relentlessly. Passing neat and at times a lot more than that. Paul Scholes: 8/10 Excellent pass for Owen's opener and once again showed his discipline by holding his withdrawn position. Some of his footwork was superb. Steven Gerrard: 6/10 Hardly the force he was in Munich, but then that was a very high standard. A few good passes but not the commander he was in Germany. Nick Barmby: 6/10 Fluffed two good early chances but then redeemed himself a little with a shimmy past a couple of defenders and a useful cross. Worked hard. Replaced by McManaman. Emile Heskey: 5/10 Disappointing evening. With Albania defending deep there was little room for his usual surges. Limped off and replaced by Fowler. Michael Owen: 8/10 Another controlled finish that further suggests he continues to develop as a footballer. Some delicate touches before the goal, too. Substitutes: Robbie Fowler: 8/10 Set up by Owen as soon as he came on for Heskey. Missed that but then supplied that sublime second. Steve McManaman: 5/10 Not his best. Missed a decent chance; one poor defensive header. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
