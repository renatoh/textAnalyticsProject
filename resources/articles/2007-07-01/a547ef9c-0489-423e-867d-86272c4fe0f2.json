Brown, 30, held talks with the Latics manager, Chris Hutchings, yesterday after being left out of Fulham's squad for the pre-season tour to the Far East. Hutchings expects to make the former Sheffield United midfielder his sixth signing of the summer if he can reach agreement with Brown over personal terms. \"We have had an offer for the player which we have accepted,\" said the Fulham manager, Lawrie Sanchez. \"Hopefully it will be resolved one way or another quickly for the sake of everyone.\" Birmingham have joined Newcastle in the race to sign the Chinese captain Zheng Zhi from Shandong Luneng. Zheng spent four months on loan at Charlton last season, making 12 appearances and scoring against the Magpies. City's interest in the 26-year-old midfielder comes only a week after the Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung became the club's leading shareholder. Yeung has made it clear he sees the Far East as a lucrative market for Blues to exploit during the coming months. Those commercial aims would be aided by the presence of representatives from that region in the Birmingham squad. Yeung, who may attempt to take complete control of Blues in the new year, said: \"We've started observing local players. We hope to have some new developments in three months. We all know the Premier League in England is very popular. I believe it will get even more popular in China. The market is bigger.\" With the club's pre-season tour of Germany now completed, the Birmingham manager, Steve Bruce, is expected to step up his attempts to complete the signing of the Tottenham pair of Mido and Hossam Ghaly for a joint fee of around \u00a39m. Brighton have finally got the go-ahead to build a new stadium in Falmer. The Seagulls have been waiting for almost nine years for approval for the 22,000-seater arena on the outskirts of the city. They have been without a permanent home since the sale of the Goldstone Ground in 1997 and spent two years groundsharing 70 miles away at Gillingham before returning to the city with a move to the Withdean Stadium in 2001. Lewes District Council could still appeal the decision - as they did in 2005 - but the club are confident that the \u00a350m project will now proceed as planned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
