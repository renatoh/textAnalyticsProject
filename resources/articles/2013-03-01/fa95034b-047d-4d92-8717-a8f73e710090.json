After all, only you [Huhne] had been in the car at the time of the offence, it had taken place at night, the camera was forward facing, and you could choose who, if anyone, to share the secret with. And you did get away with it for some eight years \u2026 To Pryce However, in November 2010, motivated (I have no doubt) by an implacable desire for revenge, and with little consideration of the position of your wider family, you decided to set about the dual objective of ruining [Huhne] whilst protecting your own position and reputation in the process. Your weapon of choice was the revelation of his part in the offence in 2003. But it was a dangerous weapon because it had, in truth, been a joint offence. To Huhne I make clear that your lies and your endeavour to manipulate the process of the court will not add a day to your sentence, although they are likely in due course to be relevant to the issue of costs. In any event you must receive a discount of 10% to reflect the fact that your late plea took a degree of courage, saved the time and expense of a trial, and may reflect the beginnings of a degree of remorse \u2013 albeit that it is easy now to apologise for your wrongdoing. To Pryce Having presided over your trials I have no doubt that whilst the immediate problem was Chris Huhne's, and that it was his idea that you should take his points, you were readily persuaded and chose to go along with it to your mutual benefit. To Huhne and Pryce To the extent that anything good has come out of this whole process, it is that now, finally, you have both been brought to justice for your joint offence. To Huhne You have fallen from a great height (albeit that that is only modest mitigation given that it is a height that you would never have achieved if you had not hidden your commission of such a serious offence in the first place) \u2026 this was as your counsel accepts a serious offence, indeed as it seems to me a flagrant offence of its type. To Pryce He was therefore somewhat, though not greatly in my view, the more culpable of the two of you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
