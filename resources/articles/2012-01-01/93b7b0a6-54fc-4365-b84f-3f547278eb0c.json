Mino Raiola accused Webb of deliberately covering up his own mistake by telling the Football Association he did not have a proper view of Balotelli's stamp on Scott Parker during City's 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Webb's evidence has been crucial in the FA charging Balotelli with violent conduct, meaning the near certainty of a four-match ban, starting with the second leg of the Carling Cup semi-final against Liverpoolon Wednesday. Some at City also suspect Webb saw the incident and, while they couched their criticisms in a more reasoned way, Raiola was scathing of the referee, the FA and the Tottenham manager, Harry Redknapp. \"The referee saw everything and even spoke to Mario after what happened,\" he said. \"So in my opinion this referee must be banned for life because he didn't tell the truth. The television images show that he is really close to the action, so how can he say he didn't see it? What was he doing? No, he is saying he didn't see it, only so he can defend himself. \"He has proved himself to be a coward. He saw everything from a metre away then he declared he didn't see anything when the press and Redknapp pushed him. That's why he's a coward because, if he had not changed his mind, the television proof would not have been enough [to charge]. I'm really mad and I think the Football Association should send this referee to the optician. If you don't see what happens one metre away, what do you see?\" Of Redknapp he added: \"Don't make me speak about Redknapp because it will make me really mad. It's not normal what they do in England.\" Raiola went on to accuse the FA of being prejudiced against foreign players and said Balotelli would think about moving if he carried on attracting so much controversy. \"If the FA don't start to protect him more, we will look for other alternatives and leave the UK. We don't accept this kind of morality. I want to be balanced but I'm worried because when English players are involved in more serious things nothing happens whereas when foreigners are involved, such as Balotelli or [Vincent] Kompany, they are treated more harshly.\" A spokesman for the Professional Game Match Officials' Limited defended Webb, saying: \"The integrity of our officials is beyond reproach.\" Raiola offered a stirring defence of the Italian striker, though one that ignored the fact Balotelli appears to be condemned by the television pictures and, by planting his studs into Parker's head, has brought the controversy on himself. City will almost certainly accept the ban, with Mancini's assistant, David Platt, admitting it would be \"futile\" to appeal when there is so much video evidence and the possibility of a fifth game being added if they were unsuccessful. There is a clear sense at the Etihad Stadium, however, that Raiola's outspoken attack, in keeping with his volatile reputation, has some foundation. \"I have seen it from an angle [on television] that is good enough to make me think the referee saw it live,\" Platt said. \"It's just my opinion and we're all allowed our opinions. It's my opinion that Howard saw the incident.\" Later he said he would accept Webb's claim but referred pointedly to the way referees who make mistakes that affect the course of games can be punished by missing matches. City accept Balotelli should have been sent off \u2013 \"It looks poor when you slow it down,\" Platt said \u2013 but their grievance is that he would not have been charged if Webb had said he had seen it. The player's recklessness means he will miss the trip to Anfield, as well as league fixtures against Everton, Fulham and Aston Villa. It will be a month before his next domestic game, leaving City with only two forwards, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Edin Dzeko. Balotelli is sticking to his story that it was accidental and Raiola continued: \"Mario can't be banned for four games. He wasn't balanced and there was also a push from [Luka] Modric. It is not an intentional foul because Mario doesn't want to hurt anyone. He didn't see Parker, that's all.\"He then returned to the subject of Balotelli's future and re-iterated that he was willing to leave England if necessary. \"If I find that there is something strange against Balotelli, my duty is to protect and then take him away. In this case I would speak with City, ask them Balotelli's price and look for the best team for him, as there are only six or seven places where he can play. I talked to Mario, who said he is happy to stay in England, but he does not understand certain things and they sadden him. Our plans were to stay in England but not like this. Mario is very upset and it's not right to attack him all the time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
