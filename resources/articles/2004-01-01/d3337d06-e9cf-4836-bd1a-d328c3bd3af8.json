But the experts advising the government on whether Britain should allow GM crops to be grown warned that two other crops could pose a threat to birds and insects. The report, the last big study before the government decides whether to give the green light to GM farming in the UK, comes against a growing clamour from environmental lobby groups to ban the use of the modified crops. \"Based on the evidence provided by the farm scale evaluation [FSE] results published in October 2003, if GM herbicide-tolerant maize were to be grown and managed as in the FSEs this would not result in adverse effects,\" the report from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (Acre) said. Field trials on GM herbicide-resistant maize did not demonstrate evidence of adverse environmental impact, Acre said. But the other two crops, beet and spring-sown oil seed rape, would have adverse effects on arable weed populations, insects and birds, compared with conventionally managed beet. \"In a sense we are saying 'yes, but' to the maize and 'no, but', both to the beet and the spring sown oil seed rape,\" said Jules Pretty, deputy chairman of Acre. \"That is not 'yes, no, no.' That is very important.\" English Nature, another advisory panel to the government, has told ministers that oil seed rape and beet should not be commercialised, but GM herbicide-tolerant maize may be commercialised subject to certain conditions. The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, said the government would consider the findings of the report before making a decision. \"In October we welcomed the publication of the results of the farm-scale evaluations - the largest study of its kind ever undertaken - and today we welcome the advice of Acre on the implications,\" she said. \"We will now consider Acre's advice, as well as the advice from English Nature, very carefully before reaching a view on whether these crops should be approved for cultivation in the EU. \"I have said consistently that the government is neither pro-nor anti-GM crops - our overriding concern is to protect human health and the environment, and to ensure genuine consumer choice.\" Mr Pretty said it was now up to ministers to consider what to do in the light of the Acre advice. He told a news conference: \"This advice confirms the case-by-case approach taken by Acre for GM crops. \"This is neither a green light for GMs nor a death knell for them. It is simply the same kind of process, of taking forward case-by-case as we have done in the past. \"These experiments showed the effects of herbicide management regimes,\" he said. \"If these had been conventionally bred herbicide-tolerant crops, we would expect the results to have been similar. \"It is the management regime that is the key part and the herbicides used.\" But green lobby groups fear moves to commercialise GM crops will harm organic farmers and lead to the emergence of damaging herbicide-resistant weeds. Sarah North, a Greenpeace campaigner, commenting today on the Acre advice, said: \"This is bad for farmers, bad for the organic food industry and bad for our countryside. \"Experience in America shows that planting GM maize leads to huge increases in pesticide use,\" she said. \"The only reason GM maize got through the British tests was because its effect on the environment was compared to a pesticide which is so toxic it's now been banned. Giving it the all-clear is like recommending a holiday in Baghdad because it might be safer than Chechnya.\" The European commission said it has today postponed a decision on whether to adopt a proposal for the authorisation of a new type of genetically modified maize."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
