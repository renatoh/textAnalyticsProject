Unlike some of his British predecessors, there is no entourage and the latest member of British cycling\u2019s select club of grand tour winners isn\u2019t expecting a fuss. There is no agent, PR, minder or publicist in sight. He orders a fried breakfast \u2014 hold the black pudding \u2014 and a pot of builder\u2019s tea and is already looking forward to a socially-distanced drink in the pub later the same afternoon, watching the Arsenal game. The Londoner wasn\u2019t really supposed to win the second biggest race in world cycling, in Milan, days ago. He had started the 2020 Giro as a support rider to an in-form Geraint Thomas but when a rogue water bottle rolled down a Sicilian street and sent the Welshman flying, everything changed. \u201cI\u2019d never experienced that before,\u201d Geoghegan Hart says, stirring his tea. \u201cBecause Geraint crashed in the neutralised zone, right next to the rest of the team, we could stop for five or six minutes. He was quiet clearly in a lot of pain, immediately. We had no idea how it had happened and it was only later in the stage that we heard he\u2019d hit a bottle. \u201cWe\u2019d started on such a high with Filippo Ganna winning the first stage and Geraint setting a really good time, so then there was this down \u2014 and it was a big down \u2014 and there was no immediate way to put the past behind us. We just had to be patient.\u201d When Thomas crashed out, Geoghegan Hart\u2019s long apprenticeship, first at Team Sky and more recently Ineos Grenadiers, was over. Even so, \u201cGooganga\u201d, as the Italians have nicknamed him, was under the radar until the final week, when stage wins and an inexorable progress up the race standings pulled him into contention. \u201cOnce everything that happened had happened to \u2018G\u2019, then you have to stay in the game,\u201d the 25-year old says. \u201cThe beauty for someone like me was that if I was going to try for stages, then I had to wait until the last week of the Giro anyway because physiologically I had a much better chance. The race route was perfect for that.\u201d By midway through the race it looked possible that he might finish in the top 10. Anything more seemed fanciful. \u201cWe never set a number, though. It was: \u2018Wake up, get ready, do the stage the best you can, see what happens, back to the hotel.\u2019 That\u2019s always how I have been in the grand tours I\u2019ve done. Anyone who tells you there was a plan is being quite brazen, or maybe looking back through rose-tinted hindsight.\u201d Two mountain stage wins, and a consistent performance in the Giro\u2019s three time trials, took Geoghegan Hart into the final week within reach of the overall lead as the race reached its climax. Victory was sealed on the final day. Italy\u2019s most renowned cycling commentator has long struggled with Geoghegan Hart\u2019s name. \u201c\u2018Googanga\u2019 he called me on Italian TV. That was just him trying to pronounce my surname. I started hearing it at races and Italians shouting it excitedly, with a real emphasis on the last \u2018A.\u2019 Now it\u2019s the Italian way you say my name.\u201d Having been out of Britain for almost a year, he is now back in Hackney. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice, although with Covid, social interactions are limited, of course, although that has been a blessing in disguise as it\u2019s made it much more manageable. Most of the media stuff has been remote. \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised, though, by the coverage. There wasn\u2019t a massive media presence at the Giro, certainly from British media, although I know there were logistical issues. But I just feel in general that cycling only gets into the mainstream media when there\u2019s a big name that wins. I really felt strange when Simon Yates won the Vuelta for the lack of attention he got, especially after the year he\u2019d had.\u201d As an elite athlete Geoghegan Hart is exempt from Covid quarantines. Tested eight times for the disease in the past few weeks, he drove to London and will drive back to Andorra, rather than fly, once his end-of-season break is over. \u201cOne of the good things to come out of the past few months has been the recognition that exercise helps people, physically and mentally,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen in Spain and Italy and France is frightening. To lock people in their homes and ban exercise \u2026 because to me, going running, alone in open space, having fresh air, is what humans need more than anything. It\u2019s what I need more than anything.\u201d For now, though, he is enjoying being back in London and has been an Arsenal fan all his life. \u201cIt was a growing up in Hackney thing, really. Where I grew up there were more [Manchester] United fans than Spurs fans. When I was seven, eight, maybe nine, it\u2019s hard to think of a better time to have been an Arsenal fan. \u201cWe\u2019re investing in the next generation,\u201d he says of Arsenal\u2019s future, \u201cand people come and go and get older all the time.\u201d The same could be said of Brailsford\u2019s Grenadiers, who have already shed Chris Froome, while Thomas\u2019 twilight years are now surely upon him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like that internally,\u201d he counters. \u201cI don\u2019t think any riders are saying that. It\u2019s not an Ineos thing, it\u2019s peloton wide. There\u2019s not many big [general classification] riders now that are 28, 29.\u201d With Egan Bernal sidelined for rehabilitation due to scoliosis, Thomas coming back, yet again, to bid for another big win and Froome departed, Geoghegan Hart\u2019s trajectory may continue to be upwards in 2021. \u201cI love my job and I\u2019m aware of what a privilege it is to be on this team,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of pro bike riders, lots of people in cycling, would love to be on this team. \u201cI\u2019m ambitious and of course I don\u2019t want this to be the only time I cross the line first, but in this sport things change and opportunities come and go. I\u2019ve never been the best person at keeping quiet since I was at nursery school, but I have always tried to speak when you really need somebody to listen. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a problem showing leadership. I\u2019m sure that some people will say I was lucky, because we had a great group of guys there that I have known a while and we were winning stages. We had a great time.\u201d In a traumatic year, cycling\u2019s shockingly poor record on diversity, in terms of both gender and race, has also been under scrutiny. A ham-fisted attempt at solidarity with the peloton\u2019s lone black rider at the Tour de France was the only moment of recognition throughout the racing season for the Black Lives Matter movement. Geoghegan Hart, a stablemate within Ineos Sport to F1\u2019s Lewis Hamilton, and whose partner, Hannah Barnes, is a British cycling champion, is more aware than most of how slow to progress his sport has been. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we can change overnight but it\u2019s something I have thought a lot about and how I can have an impact on it. There are big barriers to entry into cycling, even if it\u2019s just coming from a non-cycling background.\u201d He checks his watch and realises that Arsenal are calling and that he needs to get to the tube station. Before he leaves, though, did he get lucky by winning the Giro in the year of Covid? \u201cWhat has happened in my career quite a few times is that my best form has coincided with a teammate winning the race,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I have been part of that win, and there\u2019s nothing that I have enjoyed more, but some might look at it and say: \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been on Sky or Ineos, then you might have done it yourself already.\u2019 But the most important thing is always that the team wins.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
