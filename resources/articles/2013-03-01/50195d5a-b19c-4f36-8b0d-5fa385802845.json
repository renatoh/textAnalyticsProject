In an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, Newcastle United's French defender said: \"I really thought my leg was broken, I was in so much pain I couldn't think of anything. I was completely shocked \u2013 I still am. I've never seen such a tackle in football in my life. I shudder every time I think about it.\" Ha\u00efdara said he found it \"hard to swallow\" that McManaman will receive no punishment because the FA is prevented from taking retrospective action. \"I don't understand,\" he said. \"His tackle could have ended my career and ruined my life. I don't want to change the physical mentality, pace and commitment in England but we can't tolerate tackles like this in football.\" Despite saying that he felt \"really, really angry\" with McManaman immediately after the incident, Ha\u00efdara maintains he will bear no grudge and will be happy to respond to overtures from the player for a meeting in the next few days. \"Now I feel differently and just hope that this will give him a lesson,\" he said. Ha\u00efdara revealed that a series of scans have shown no damage to his knee ligaments or broken bones and that he has sustained nothing more than severe bruising to his left leg. But he suggested the brutal challenge may have inflicted some short-term psychological damage. \"I feel the need to be cautious and don't want to go back too fast,\" he said. \"I will be apprehensive.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
