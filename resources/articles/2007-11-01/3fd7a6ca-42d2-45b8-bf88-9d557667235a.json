Add the stock and milk in equal proportions. Add the fish, and lightly poach it in the broth. Strip the corn cobs and pare off the niblets with a sharp knife. When the fish is done, lift the fillets from the pan and set aside in a colander to cool. Add the potatoes to the liquor. While they are simmering, flake the fish into a bowl and discard the skin along with any stray bones. When the potatoes are almost done, add the sweetcorn to cook for the last couple of minutes. Return the flaked fish to the pot and stir. Serve in small bowls with a garnish of parsley. \u00b7 Go to lifeandhealth.theguardian.com/foodmonth to see a video of Hugh preparing this dish.
