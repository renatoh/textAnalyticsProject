Up until now the fans and the board have remained remarkably supportive of the players and manager despite a season that has miserably failed to meet expectations. Patience is beginning to wear thin, however. On Saturday the supporters turned on Mario Melchiot, booing his every touch after his second successive defensive error, and later on David Gold, Birmingham's chairman, turned up the heat on Steve Bruce. \"We have always been very loyal,\" said Gold, concerning Bruce's position as manager. \"That should not be mistaken for blind loyalty, though. Steve Bruce was employed as manager of Birmingham City. He has nine games left to keep us in the Premiership. I feel I've been successful in every other aspect of my life and I can tell you being stuck in the bottom three of the Premiership really hurts, it hurts like hell.\" Time is clearly no healer. Birmingham have been anchored in the relegation zone since October and those clinging on to hopes of starting next season in the Premiership are ignoring the malaise that has set in and a run-in that could not be more demanding. Next up in the league is a trip to Old Trafford before Chelsea visit St Andrew's the following weekend. The fixtures thereafter are hardly kind, heightening fears that Birmingham's fate is already sealed. Portsmouth's victory over West Ham did not aid Birmingham's cause, but Bruce refused to blame Alan Pardew for his dubious team selection. The Birmingham manager is aware that results elsewhere are academic as long as his side is unable to summon any momentum of their own. A 5-0 thumping of Pompey in January briefly raised hopes of a revival though results since then, with the exception of a narrow victory over Sunderland, have eroded any optimism. Injuries have contributed to Birmingham's fall yet that is not the sole reason for their slump. A goal drought has afflicted the strikers all season - they have managed only four in open play between them in the Premiership since August - and Bruce's attempts to address the problem have failed. Chris Sutton has joined the overcrowded treatment room before opening his account and DJ Campbell, who made his first start against Spurs, cannot be expected to make the transition from non-league football to the Premiership within 12 months. Impotence up front places pressure on other departments, particularly defence, and it is there that Birmingham have looked increasingly vulnerable in recent weeks. Matthew Upson's absence through injury has left a hole in central defence as big as the one that Melchiot wanted to disappear down when he allowed Jermain Defoe to pick his pocket. Aaron Lennon, benefiting from Defoe's perseverance, did what no one at Birmingham appears capable of when he rammed a left-foot shot low into the bottom corner of the net. Bruce refused to defend Melchiot, admitting that the full-back, who committed another blunder against West Bromwich Albion the previous weekend, has failed to match last season's standards. The Dutchman is not alone in that respect. Emile Heskey in particular cuts a sad figure, his confidence palpably lacking. A heavy first touch allowed Jamie Clapham's through ball to run harmlessly into the arms of Paul Robinson and a miscue from two yards brought sighs of exasperation. For \u00a36m Birmingham are entitled to expect a better return than one goal in 17 appearances. Others have also failed to deliver. There was no better example of Nicky Butt's demise than the sight of the impressive Jermaine Jenas leaving him in his wake as he burst from the halfway line. Butt was not so much struggling to keep up as treading water. The former Manchester United and England midfielder is no more than a run-of-the-mill footballer now, part of a side that has too many players the wrong side of 30. Little wonder that Bruce envisages major surgery in the summer. Although his team showed plenty of spirit against Spurs, brain as well as brawn is required to succeed in the Premiership. Those that might have provided the former, Muzzy Izzet and David Dunn, were, like Sven-Goran Eriksson, sat in the stand. It was a worthwhile visit for the England coach, who must have warmed to the sight of Defoe making a rare start. His assist and Robbie Keane's tap-in after Michael Carrick fed Jenas with a beautifully weighted pass ensured Spurs held on to fourth place. Afterwards Martin Jol spoke of his vision for Tottenham, remarking that he has the \"foundations and walls\" in place. \"The roof is not there yet,\" added the Spurs coach. It could be worse. Bruce probably feels like knocking everything down and starting again. He must hope that he gets the chance.
