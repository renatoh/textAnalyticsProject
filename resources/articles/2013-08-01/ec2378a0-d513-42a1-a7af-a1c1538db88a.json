England have scored 551 for six declared in the first innings. Australia, having been 286 for five, have battled their way to 513 and at the close of play on the fourth day England are 59 for one, looking good with a lead of 97. I probably don't need to remind England fans what happened on day five: Shane Warne took four wickets, England collapsed and Australia scored the 168 needed to win in quick time. I mention that match not to make Australians feel better (though they need some cheer after events at the Riverside) but to illustrate a point \u2013 when you're used to winning, success breeds success. You can find ways to win from all kind of positions and, crucially, you believe you can win from any situation. The Australian team that I was lucky enough to play in had a certain aura and sometimes you had teams beaten before you even walked on the field. England aren't at that stage but after 12 Tests without defeat and five wins in six they've got that confidence, that belief. Adelaide was as much down to attitude as anything else. That last day England went into it with a negative mindset, whereas we backed ourselves to win from that situation, as we did in more or less any Test-match situation. England started to play a little bit negatively, a little bit defensively and the rest is history. We saw something of that old Baggy Green mentality from England on Monday evening at the Riverside. When you're playing in a good team where you're confident in yourself and your team-mates, when you've done the business before, it makes it so much easier. The opposite is also true: when you're used to losing you somehow keep finding ways to lose. Australia were right in the game with England 275 for eight in their second innings, but the last two pairs were able to score another 55 runs. Then they couldn't have had a better start to the run chase and even at 168 for two were still in a reasonable position. But when you haven't had that experience of toughing it out for a victory you can be on top in a game, something happens, it's \"here we go again \u2026\" and you end up losing another one you could have won. They'll be devastated and probably rightly so. As a bowler it's a strange feeling when you start running through a team. You get that one wicket under your belt and suddenly you start running in feeling loose, feeling relaxed and thinking about what you want to bowl rather than focusing on trying to force that wicket. On Monday evening Stuart Broad was slap bang in the middle of the zone and when you've got a bowler in the zone at one end and someone like Tim Bresnan at the other keeping things tight, the batsmen just feel suffocated. After the third wicket fell, negativity swept through the Australian team and after that the game was over. But it's not all down to attitude. England have got some hugely talented players and the one who has really impressed me is Ian Bell. He hasn't won a man-of-the-match award but for me he's been the man of the series. Back when I played, I always felt that we could get a mental edge over him. But, like England, he's greatly improved in that regard. He's a very experienced player and he knows his game very well. Most impressively of all he has shown he can adjust. The contrast between the first Test and the second Test was quite incredible \u2013 he played a lot square and behind square on a slow wicket at Trent Bridge, then at Lord's when the ball came on a little bit better he played very straight, down the ground. He hasn't just gone out thinking: \"This is the way I play, no matter what the conditions\". A lot of batsmen these days don't adapt. You get them on a slow turner or on a wicket that is quick and bouncy and they can't cope. They just try to play the way they play and they don't score runs. Bell, though, has become a complete batsman and the scary thing for Australia is that as a team England haven't really produced a complete performance yet. It has been one or two players per Test that have done the business. Australia will try to find the positives but you wonder where they can go from here. They've taken a massive blow and somehow they have to pick themselves up. If you get on a roll \u2013 good or bad \u2013 it's hard to get out of it, but it's not impossible. Back in 2001, for example, we had won 16 Tests in a row, the last of which was the first Test against India which we had taken by 10 wickets. In the second Test in Kolkata we had them following on 274 runs behind and four wickets down in their second innings with Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly back in the hutch before they'd even reached parity. We were nailed on to win our 17th on the bounce \u2026 but then Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman come out and put on 376 for the fifth wicket and we end up losing by 171 runs. It just goes to show that no team, no matter what kind of momentum may be behind them, is invincible. Australia have to remember that and come out fighting in the final Test."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
