This is not because the ruling - which has triggered a tidal wave of apoplexy among seasoned net users all over the world - is the right one. It will in any case go to appeal. The reason it is important is that it could be the start of some serious thought about a space that has become a no-go area for rational thinking. Of course, we all want the internet to be as free a place as possible - just as we would like the rest of the world to be. But the idea that the web is an ethereal space where normal laws need not be obeyed nor taxes be paid is a recipe for the worst kind of anarchy. If libertarians claim that there should be no libel laws anywhere then they are at least being consistent. But to argue that libel laws should exist everywhere except on the internet is ridiculous. Citizens of cyberspace should enjoy at least the same freedom to do as they do in the real world but also the same freedom (from extortion, robbery, libel, etc) that they do elsewhere. The fact that it is much more difficult to enforce the law through the web must not be used as an excuse for doing nothing. For heaven's sake, the web has yet to celebrate its 10th anniversary as a mass phenomenon. No one should be surprised at the slowness of progress. Dan Gillmor, of Silicon Valley's local newspaper, the Mercury News, argues that to say that defamation occurs where something has been read rather than where it was posted is an invitation to abuse, and that in any case it is absurd to expect anyone who posts anything on the internet to understand the libel laws of 190 nations. These are fair points but the distinction between being posted and read is a very tenuous one. The web is a global book whose pages can be opened anywhere in the world. The essence of posting is that you know it could be read - and intend it to be read - by anyone, otherwise why not email your thoughts to a closed group? This is an international problem and requires an international solution which doesn't result in American law being declared international law. It will not be easy to find case law that allows people to publish critical material about human rights abuses in Zimbabwe (even though declared illegal by its government) without compromising free speech in Ohio. But it can be done, and the outcome is likely to be the lowest common denominator - so there will be an underlying bias in favour of libertarianism. International monitoring has been slowly happening in every other activity - from world health to nuclear safety - so why shouldn't it happen on the web? We already have bodies like the World Trade Organisation fixing tariffs for trade and punishing recalcitrants plus a European and International Court of Justice. People readily accept common European tariffs, even a common European currency, so why is it such a big deal to have a common European - and eventually, global - libel code whose principles could be decided by an international court even if the cases continue to be heard in national courts? The biggest stumbling block is not the mosaic of different laws but the inability of the internet community to police itself. The nearest thing the internet has to a self-governing body is ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) which controls the web's worldwide addressing system. It recently voted to relieve itself of representatives elected by internet users. Some precedent that. The optimistic way of interpreting all this is that the internet is shedding the unreal dreams of its founding architects. (Do you remember when self-policing involved spamming anyone who dared to commercialise the internet?). This is the philosophical equivalent of the dotcom explosion which brought web entrepreneurs down to earth with a bang. Growing up means accepting that the global village needs its own bobby. The question is not whether it will happen but whether net users are mature enough to take the lead in the building process. It has already started in Australia and it desperately needs sensible contributions from those who will be affected. Is it too much to hope that the equivalent of Linux - the global cooperative building a rival operating system to Microsoft - might emerge for governance of the web? Nothing ventured, nothing gained. \u00b7 Comments to online.feedback@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
