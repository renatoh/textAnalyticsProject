And now we are hungrier than ever.\u201d As mission statements go, it is not only emphatic but potentially hubristic. Then again, Brailsford has form. Five years ago this week, when Team Sky were unveiled at Millbank Tower on a grubby London day, Brailsford set himself two targets: to win the Tour de France within five years and to get a million more people on bikes in Britain. In both measures he has overachieved. Yet he remains forever restless: still itching to discover more, still itching to make Team Sky the alpha males of the peloton again. Hence the heightened focus on hi-tech when he spoke on Sunday at the team\u2019s winter training camp in Mallorca. \u201cThe advances in technology and human applications are just exploding,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are certain areas where it is becoming obvious that there are gains to be made and so we\u2019re working pretty hard on that. I\u2019m off to San Francisco in a couple of weeks and I\u2019ve got my fingers in quite a few pies over there to get abreast of all the latest technologies and see how we can apply those to our sport.\u201d Sky are believed to be concentrating on finding new ways to improve rider recovery but Brailsford would not be drawn on specifics. As he put it, with a twinkle in his eye: \u201cWe\u2019ve done pretty well helping other cycling teams out over the last five years\u201d. When pressed, however, he did admit: \u201cBig data is an obvious area where there is a lot of work going on, in football and American sports, and we have a lot of data in different areas. That\u2019s a great area of interest to us.\u201d Five-year plans. Embracing technology. It has a whiff of Harold Wilson\u2019s \u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d plans about it. It is also bold given that 2014 hardly went to plan. Chris Froome crashed in the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and in the Tour de France; the team\u2019s No2, Richie Porte, fell ill in Tirreno-Adriatico and contracted pneumonia in the Tour; Geraint Thomas crashed on the penultimate day in Paris-Nice when second \u2013 and, as Brailsford admitted, the team were not as consistent as they wanted to be either. But Brailsford is not one to apply balm to old bruises. \u201cHow we think about it is this \u2013 it\u2019s not failure so don\u2019t get downhearted about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an opportunity to learn how to win more. You\u2019ve got to be hungry, you\u2019ve got to have the desire and motivation to get up and believe you can go and do something again.\u201d In terms of targets for the next five years, Brailsford believes there is a broader spectrum of races the team can win. \u201cWhen people look back at the last five years they will say that we were fantastic at stage-racing but we haven\u2019t fared that well in one-day races.\u201d That is indisputable. Sky have never won one of the Monuments, the five most prestigious one-day classics on the calendar, although Ben Swift was third in Milan-San Remo last year and they had two top-10 finishers in Paris-Roubaix. As Brailsford concedes: \u201cWe can become a more complete team.\u201d Brailsford has a spycatcher\u2019s attention to detail, so it comes as no surprise that in Team Sky\u2019s hotel in Mallorca there are antimicrobial hand sanitisers on every dining table and bottles of water on every floor. But there is a human side to him too, and he says he detects that Froome\u2019s hunger switch is on again after a mixed 2014. \u201cWhen you go through a massive life-changing experience like that, you win the Tour de France, you go in and it\u2019s such a big experience, that\u2019s going to impact anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you try and support people through that. And now he\u2019s happy in his skin, as it were. He says: \u2018Right, I\u2019ve won the Tour, we know what we need to do, let\u2019s go and give it another crack.\u2019\u201d Brailsford has also noted that Froome is growing into his role as team leader. \u201cThe amount of respect he\u2019s got from other riders in terms of his leadership ability is off the scale, they love him,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way, for example, in the Vuelta when he\u2019s suffering and he\u2019s riding back up and he\u2019s getting dropped again and he rides back up. He refused to give in and he refused to quit and he suffered and suffered and suffered. The riders see that, they see the suffering that he does, as it were. They respect him. \u201cAnd the way that he\u2019s always very grateful to them, he appreciates their help. He communicates well, they\u2019ve got a lot of respect for him.\u201d Froome, meanwhile, agrees that he is \u201ca lot hungrier and eager to get back\u201d and has set his sights on the Ruta del Sol, Tirreno-Adriatico and Fl\u00e8che Wallonne as he builds up to regain the Tour de France in July. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018make right\u2019 for last year but it definitely leaves me hungry, leaves me wanting to achieve more,\u201d he said. Froome believes that with the signing of Nicolas Roche, Leopold Konig and Wout Poels, Sky have the best team in their history. \u201cI really do think this year we have an amazing pool of riders to select the Tour team,\u201d he said. \u201cI would go as far as to say it\u2019s the strongest all-round team we\u2019ve had.\u201d Brailsford, however, believes the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. \u201cHow do you define strongest team given we\u2019ve won the Tour de France twice?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think the analysis ultimately is in the outcome. But ultimately, in terms of pure talent and ability, we\u2019ve got some great strength in depth. If it\u2019s on top form I think it would be the strongest team. It\u2019s been a lot of fun to be around. It\u2019s a great group dynamic. So in that respect, it could be the best team we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Brailsford has no regrets about stepping down from his role with British Cycling to focus on Team Sky last April. Most mornings in Mallorca he is out after breakfast, when the morning mists are still strangling the palm trees, to ride his bike before his riders begin their training. \u201cI\u2019ve been away more since I stopped that dual role than I was before,\u201d he adds, smiling. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that. It\u2019s a clear focus now and it certainly feels after the first five years that we are starting a new chapter. It really does. There\u2019s an energy. Everybody\u2019s hungry. It\u2019s like we are starting all over again. It feels fantastic, to be honest, it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
