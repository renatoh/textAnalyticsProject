Mohammad Qamar Sarwar-Rana, of Kings Heath, Birmingham, performed more than 18 operations, including circumcisions and a vasectomy, when his blood could have infected patients. Sarwar-Rana, who acted as a locum at four different hospitals, ignored Department of Health rules issued in 2002 and never told the consultants involved in the surgery that he had hepatitis. The GMC will decide whether his actions constitute serious professional misconduct."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
