Almost inevitably, Britain's enduring obsession with the weather has now entered the complex world of spread betting. Following the sunniest March for 40 years, City firm Cantor Index has linked up with the Met Office to offer punters a chance to place spread bets on the weather. The initiative, launched last week, offers spreads on hours of sunshine and inches of rainfall in individual months. Prices will be offered for specific sporting events and days such as Christmas. Other spread betting firms have toyed with the idea but dropped the plan fearing a lack of interest. However, Tim Hogman of Cantor Index said: 'It's been amazing. This has really taken off. Sometimes clients can be a bit unsure about a new product but this has hit the ground running. He added: 'Everyone is betting on a dry or sunny April. Clients are buying sunshine hours and selling rain.' Cantor is 'selling' rainfall for the month of April at 33 to 37mm. This means that should rainfall be less than 33 mm, punters will get a payout. So far, with over half the month gone, there has only been 4mm. The company has increased the predicted number of sunshine hours for April from 187 to 195. Hogman said the 'vast majority' of those taking a bet have been private individuals. Cantor has launched the weather betting with WeatherXchange, a subsidiary of the Met Office, set up to provide data products, brokerage and consultancy to the weather derivatives market. Until now weather derivatives have only been available to market professionals who use them to hedge against the risk that adverse weather conditions pose to business. According to the Met Office, some 70 per cent of businesses can suffer from adverse weather. The complex financial products are used by energy firms such as Innogy, Npower or British Gas. In the US, weather derivatives were made famous by failed Texas energy trader Enron. Energy companies typically take out derivatives contracts to protect themselves against selling less energy if the winter is unusually warm. The global market for weather derivatives has been growing steadily in recent years and is now estimated to be worth $4.3bn, according to the Weather Risk Management Association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
