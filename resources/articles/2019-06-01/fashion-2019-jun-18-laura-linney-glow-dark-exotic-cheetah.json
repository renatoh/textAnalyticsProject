We started with just a swatch of the sequinned fabric, and I went in for several fittings. This dress was incredibly comfortable but also wonderfully festive and celebratory. But the great surprise of this dress \u2013 which none of us knew, not even Derek \u2013 was that the white sequins were glow-in-the-dark. I got in the car to go to the Tonys and all of a sudden I started to glow in the dark like an exotic cheetah! It was great fun. I\u2019d never worn anything quite like this, and a full-blown sequin outfit is not easy to pull off. Unless it\u2019s 1975: it doesn\u2019t happen much any more. I have a long relationship with Derek and I also know that he loves the theatre, so it was an obvious choice for me to wear one of his dresses. It\u2019s always wonderful to be with a designer from the beginning of an idea \u2013 he gave me several choices of colours and sequin patterns, but I just followed his lead. I\u2019m not a dressy-dressy person, but it is fun to dress up and it\u2019s part of the tradition of a red-carpet event. The Tonys mean a great deal to me because I grew up in the theatre, and it\u2019s really satisfying to be part of this tremendous theatre community. I did not grow up fashion-conscious at all. I wasn\u2019t exposed to it, and it wasn\u2019t realistic for me. It\u2019s taken me a while to be comfortable with it. Most of the time I am working, so I make some effort to look presentable, to feel like a human being and not just schlubb around. At the same time, there\u2019s a reality about living in trailers when you are doing film, or dusty rehearsal rooms when you are in a play; to still be comfortable and functional, there\u2019s a balance you have to hit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
