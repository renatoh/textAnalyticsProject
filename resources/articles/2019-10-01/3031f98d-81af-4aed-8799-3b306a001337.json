Creasy led a successful push in the Commons earlier this year to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland \u2013 the only part of the UK where it remains illegal except in a very narrow set of circumstances. MPs amended the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill, to say that the government in Westminster would be required to extend the right to abortion if the Northern Ireland assembly and executive at Stormont are not up and running by 21 October. Another amendment imposed the same requirement in respect of same-sex marriage. With just days to go before that deadline, the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has spent much of the past few days locked in discussions with all the political parties at Stormont. Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker, speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, hinted the government believes the devolved institutions could soon be restored. \u201cThe British and Irish governments both share the view that there remains an opportunity in the coming days to reach an accommodation,\u201d he said. He said that if the assembly and the executive are not up and running by Monday\u2019s deadline, the government will extend rights to abortion and same sex marriage to Northern Ireland, as required by the act. But he insisted, \u201cthis would not be a good outcome\u201d, saying it would be better for the decisions to be made by the devolved institutions. \u201cOne only has to look at the passionate and sincere demonstrations in recent weeks on both sides of this issue to appreciate that this remains a highly sensitive matter in Northern Ireland. \u201cI understand that there are many people in Northern Ireland who may welcome the change. There are also many who would not. I would prefer, and the government would prefer, that the Northern Ireland assembly was considering reforms of Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion law.\u201d However, Creasy claimed handing control back to Stormont would be in contravention of the act, which places an obligation on the secretary of state to ensure the recommendations of a report by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women be extended to Northern Ireland. \u201cThe act specifically says the regulations that enable abortion rest with Secretary of State and are a human rights issue. For the assembly to take over the responsibility will require change to that,\u201d she said. She tweeted that the government was using women as \u201cbargaining chips\u201d. The DUP, which describes itself as a \u201cpro-life party\u201d, has expressed concerns about the extension of abortion rights; and the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, joined a demonstration outside Stormont on the issue last month. In an article published shortly afterwards, she said the party\u2019s position on the issue was \u201cresolute and unchanged,\u201d and insisted the planned liberalisation of abortion law was \u201cfar beyond anything any Northern Ireland assembly would ever have endorsed\u201d. With Boris Johnson hoping to secure the DUP\u2019s support for his Brexit deal in the coming days, Creasy challenged Walker in the Commons. \u201cThe last time that there were official cross-party talks was in July. We are literally five days away from this bill becoming an act, and therefore the provisions on abortion and same sex marriage being extended as equal rights to Northern Ireland. \u201cWhat could it possibly be in the next couple of days that has made suddenly the government to have such a renewed vigour in these talks, and to offer the idea that abortion could be suspended for Northern Ireland, to the people, when there\u2019s a Brexit deal to be done?\u201d she asked. Walker replied that he completely rejected that characterisation. As crunch talks continue over securing a Brexit deal with the EU, the support of the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs is crucial. The DUP\u2019s apparent backing for customs arrangements proposed by Johnson, which involve an effective border in the Irish Sea, came as a surprise to many \u2013 though it remains unclear whether the DUP will support Johnson\u2019s deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
