The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, who chairs parliament\u2019s joint committee on law enforcement, said asking the AFP to justify the widely condemned raids would be \u201cthe first order of business\u201d once MPs returned to Canberra in July. On Thursday the Labor senator Doug Cameron told Guardian Australia the oversight powers of parliament\u2019s committees were \u201cthird division and not A grade\u201d compared with the US and UK, citing an inability to investigate the operation of security agencies. Kelly, a conservative Liberal MP from New South Wales, said the bipartisan committee on law enforcement had scope to examine the activities and powers of the AFP and said the acting commissioner, Neil Gaughan, needed to appear to \u201cgive us an explanation as to why this occurred\u201d. \u201cWe would call in the commissioner of the AFP and he would have to be cross-examined by members of the committee,\u201d Kelly told Guardian Australia. \u201cI understand there is a need for balance. No one likes to see journalists\u2019 homes being raided but the security people that we have, and the AFP, have certain responsibilities as well. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a position where we are prejudging anything, but that is what the committee is there for, to have that oversight.\u201d On Thursday Gaughan all but confirmed the journalists themselves were at risk of prosecution in the case of the ABC\u2019s report of alleged unlawful killings by Australian troops and Annika Smethurst\u2019s report of plans to extend powers to spy on Australian citizens. But while MPs will interrogate the raids through parliament\u2019s existing mechanisms, Cameron wants a standing committee established in addition to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, which scrutinises legislation. The idea for a standing committee is one of many proposed to deal with the shocked reaction at the extent of Australia\u2019s secrecy laws, which can penalise both public servants who make unauthorised disclosures and journalists who publish official secrets. The idea builds on work by the former Labor senator John Faulkner and a private member\u2019s bill by Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, to give the existing committee power to start its own inquiries, but goes further by calling for oversight of operations and the processes of security agencies. \u201cIn a democracy you can\u2019t hand over to the AFP and security services complete and unequivocal independence from parliamentary oversight,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cOnce you start giving these agencies more power we have to have more oversight.\u201d Cameron said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to get information through the Senate estimates process, with police using the fact investigations were still active to block questioning. The standing committee could hold hearings in private where necessary or in public where in the public interest, he said. The PJCIS is expressly forbidden from reviewing intelligence gathering, operational methods, particular operations, information from a foreign government or complaints against security agencies. Cameron said parliament was \u201cexcluded from oversight\u201d and the existing committee was \u201crestricted\u201d. \u201cIf you want the public to have confidence in the federal police and security agencies they have to have confidence there is proper oversight from the people they elect.\u201d In the UK the intelligence and security committee can review operational information where it is provided voluntarily, while in the US the Senate and House select committees on intelligence can review operations as a matter of course. Last year after a push from Centre Alliance, government departments including the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet rejected a call for greater parliamentary oversight of security agencies, citing the existing inspector general of intelligence and security. Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, said: \u201cThe principle of accompanying new powers with new oversight is one that Labor has long supported. \u201cOf course, any legislation we submit in this new parliament will go through our usual processes, but this has been a longstanding commitment from Labor.\u201d The Greens have proposed stronger whistleblower protections and a charter of rights in response to the raids, while Centre Alliance has proposed adding a constitutional protection for freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said the raids \u201cprovide a salutary warning that freedom of the press, a pillar of our democracy, cannot be taken for granted, and indeed is under significant threat\u201d. \u201cA constitutional amendment along these lines would put a brake on any future government efforts to suppress the freedom of the press or freedom of expression for all Australians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would also set a clear benchmark against which current laws can be judged.\u201d Scott Morrison has suggested he is \u201copen to discussing\u201d concerns about security laws\u2019 impact on the press but has not proposed any substantive changes to secrecy laws. Keneally has suggested to the government that Labor would support a process to review national security laws, provided it was on a bipartisan basis. \u201cThe government of the day is the Morrison government and they need to stand up, speak on this issue; if they want to work with us on this, I say the door is open,\u201d she said on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
