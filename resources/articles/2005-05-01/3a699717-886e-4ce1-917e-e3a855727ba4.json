Crete", "bodyText": "Why? Because of its silver sea, snow-capped mountains and the huddled, intimate hamlets. The best thing: The Cretans. The people on the island have a raw, unpredictable and admirable energy for life, and they burst with hospitality. Cretans are very much of their island and it is hard to separate the two - I couldn't imagine one without the other. My ideal day: I'd wake up at the Nida plateau,'the roof of Crete' reputed to be the birthplace of Zeus. It's a green plain closed in by the ash-grey Dikti mountain. Then I'd head for a swim at Kefalas, in a hidden bay, followed by lunch. An afternoon siesta is a national event in Crete. In the evening, I'd go to a taverna called The Three Doors in Vrysses, which has fantastic food fresh from the mountains. My advice: Get out of the tourist villages and explore - it's such an un-European island. Hire a car but not a moped or motorbike - the Cretans are dangerously spirited drivers! Getting there: Cheapflights currently has return flights to Heraklion, Crete, from Gatwick from around \u00a3139. \u00b7 Rory MacLean's Falling For Icarus: A Journey Among The Cretans is published by Penguin at \u00a37.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
