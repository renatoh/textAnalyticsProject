Exterminate/self-isolate The public have been warned tougher measures will have to be implemented if people do not adhere to physical distancing rules, but no one expected it to come in the form of extraterrestrial villains. Residents of Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, near Whitby, were surprised to see a Dalek patrolling the streets telling people to stay indoors. \u201cBy order of the Daleks, all humans must stay indoors, all humans must self-isolate,\u201d the Doctor Who villain screeched as it zoomed along the street. It is unclear who is behind the creative stunt, which some found amusing, but it brought back scary memories for many fans of the long-running sci-fi series. One Twitter user wrote: \u201cAm I the only one to feel a genuine shiver of fear watching this? As a child I would most certainly have been hiding behind the sofa. And if a Cyberman came marching down the road, that would be it, I\u2019d be running for my life!\u201d Tayside police in Scotland shared the video, saying: \u201cOur colleagues in Skaro division have deployed their Direct Action Local Enforcement Kops to ensure everyone is following guidelines about isolation and social distancing.\u201d Girl thanks hundreds of key workers with personalised display An eight-year-old girl from Chesterfield has thanked NHS staff and key workers with an elaborate window display featuring hundreds of their names. Grace Cooper came up with the idea as a way of keeping busy during the lockdown, and, after her mum issued a callout for names on Facebook, they were soon inundated. She has carefully written each name on a love heart, around a sign that reads: \u201cNot all heroes wear capes.\u201d Grace said: \u201cIt\u2019s to thank all the key workers for going out and risking their lives to save us. I want them all to know they are appreciated and we are grateful to them.\u201d Her mother, Lauren Liggatt, told the Derbyshire Times: \u201cWe\u2019ve got hundreds of names now and I\u2019ve got a huge pile which I need to put up. We\u2019ve filled one window are now moving on to another one. \u201cGrace is really pleased with it and I am so proud of her. She said she wanted to thank the people who are working to keep us safe and well, and that is so nice of her.\u201d Police make special visit to birthday boy in lockdown A four-year-old boy whose birthday celebrations were cancelled because of the coronavirus lockdown was treated to a visit from a local police officer who stopped by to lift his spirits on the big day. Dexter Lee should have been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his family but the trip had to be cancelled when the lockdown came into force. Unable to see any of his friends or family on the special day, Dexter\u2019s mum, Anna, asked if anyone knew of a police officer who could cheer up her son, who wants to join the force when he is older, with a special wave as they drove past. To her surprise, Sgt Mark Wilson from Merseyside police, along with the force mascot, Bobby, turned up with a goody bag and a superhero card from Ch Con Andy Cooke especially for Dexter. Dexter and his big brother, Freddie, even got to sit in the police van, while their grandparents watched from their cars, which were parked nearby. \u201cThe most we were hoping for was for a police officer to drive by and flash the sirens. We are so overwhelmed by the effort the police went to today. It has brought a lot of cheer to us and the whole neighbourhood,\u201d Dexter\u2019s parents said. Couple stuck in neverending Maldives honeymoon Hundreds of travellers are still stranded around the world after coronavirus lockdowns came into force \u2013 but one honeymooning couple ended up better off than most. Surrounded by a fleet of staff catering to their every need on a luxury Maldivian resort, Olivia and Raul De Freitas have found themselves on an eternal honeymoon. Arriving at the Cinnamon Velifushi Maldives resort on 22 March for what was supposed to be a six-night stay, the newlyweds were soon the only two guests left when their home country, South Africa, closed its airports in response to the pandemic and they were unable to leave. The resort, which hosts up to 180 guests, continued to put on a full performance in the dining hall each night for the pair while nine staff members remained on standby. Room service checked on them five times a day, while other workers treated the couple to an elaborate candlelit dinner on the beach, they told the New York Times. They were told they would have to hire a chartered jet with other South Africans stuck in the Maldives in order to get home. But, at a cost of a $104,000, they decided to stay put. They have now been transferred to another luxury resort, along with other South Africans in the region, with a large proportion of their costs subsidised. However, their return date remains unknown. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 April 2020 to correct the picture caption."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
