On Saturday, Cowell will return to The X Factor for the first time in four years in a bid to reverse the show's falling ratings. He will be part of a new look judging line-up featuring former Girls Aloud star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (formerly Cole), who has buried the hatchet with Cowell after she was ignominiously dumped from the US version of the show. Cowell criticised the corporation after it emerged that BBC1's celebrity dance show Strictly Come Dancing had been scheduled directly against The X Factor when it returns the following weekend. He said the BBC wanted to \"damage\" his show and \"should be grown up about it and admit it\". \"I always think that when people do that the people they are pissing off are the viewers,\" Cowell said at the programme's launch this week. \"And they say this isn't a ratings battle, it is, that's why they did it. \"They didn't have to put it on at the same time as us, they did and it means that people then have to make the choice where before I think it was more of a gentleman's type agreement. It just shows the producers of the show for what they are. \"They don't want this show to do well, they don't want people to watch it, and our job is to do the best job we can so people prefer X Factor to them. They are two of the most popular shows of the year, it doesn't make sense to make viewers choose.\" The X Factor's ratings have been in decline ever since Cowell last appeared as a judge in 2010 and it has lost out in the ratings wars to its bitter BBC1 rival for the last two years. The US edition fared even worse and has since been axed. Despite the decline, last year's final, won by Sam Bailey, had an overnight audience of just fewer than 10 million viewers, making it one of ITV's biggest shows of the year. Cowell, who signed a \u00a3150m deal with ITV last year, admitted he had been \"arrogant\" about the show in the past and said he would be disappointed if this year's series did not do better and beat Strictly Come Dancing. \"The expectations on us are huge,\" he admitted. \"I think that when we have been arrogant in the past, when we were winning, you kind of get complacent, that's when we lost out,\" he added. \"When we were on the back foot and had to really concentrate on the show, that's when we did better. I feel we are in that position at the moment. We are not necessarily expecting to win although we would like to; we are going all out to make a better show.\" It is not the first time the programmes have clashed. Five years ago, it prompted the then BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons to criticise the corporation, saying viewers were \"asked to make a choice between the programmes and that choice didn't go in favour of the BBC\". \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
