The twist is that Hancock is a lazy, boozy slacker. While saving lives, he creates expensive chaos wherever his missions take him, making him a public menace. Depressed idealistic PR man Jason Bateman takes up his case on a pro bono basis with mildly amusing results. Then comes the second twist. Another superhero emerges and this for some reason has the effects of weakening Hancock's powers. It ends up a confused festival of sentimentality and special effects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
