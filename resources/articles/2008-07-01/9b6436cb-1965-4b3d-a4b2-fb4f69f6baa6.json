It's close in many ways to The Birds, but on the opposite coast, much more violent and offering an explicit explanation of the source of the looming catastrophe. A storm followed by a creeping mist visits a small town in Maine and commercial artist David Drayton (Tom Hanks lookalike Thomas Jane) finds himself sheltering with his small son and several dozen other shoppers in a supermarket. The all-enveloping mist outside is somehow devouring everything in its path. First, some ghastly carnivorous tentacles reach under the grill of a loading bay at the back, leading eventually to a frontal assault by fierce creatures that are not of this world. Is this an act of a vengeful God as local religious zealot Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) thinks? Or has it something to do with the top secret Arrowhead Project at a nearby government research station? Just as scary as the initial suspense and the grotesque monsters is the response of the isolated community in the store. They divide first over class and race, then on religious grounds, with the insane Mrs Carmody's faith faction seeking to make blood sacrifices to placate an angry God and the rational Drayton's secular survivors risking their lives to seek help from outside. It's an allegory of a sort that harks back to the Cold War anxieties that produced the wave of 1950s horror flicks (in this it resembles M Night Shamalayan's recent, much inferior The Happening), but it's unusually harrowing and relentless in its apocalyptic pessimism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
