You've turned the volume knob down against the soaring arias of pro- or anti-urban rhetoric, the coughing, the whispering, the snoring \u2013 all the sonic ooze that generally accompanies the great American political ballet. What's left there for you to piece together a coherent story is a series of gestures and movements that speak for themselves, sometimes gracefully, at other times awkwardly, often in the form of crippled, painful-looking seizures. Last week, the curtain rose on a new act in the staging of American urban policy, a long-winded narrative of Joycean proportions to which president-elect Barack Obama added a new character in the form of the White House office of urban policy. The creation of this position is, in terms of political gesture, small but emphatic. It plainly acknowledges that the important question about America's urban areas is no longer whether there are problems in this country's relationship to its cities but rather what might possibly be done about them. Obama's biggest leap across the embattled stage of urban politics is perhaps his decision to expand the rigid and unrealistic definition of urban America as a list of central cities with fixed limits - a definition that automatically sandwiches a fat, one-dimensional American suburbia between thin slices of urban and rural. By contrast, the office of urban policy is poised to consider and coordinate policies that affect entire metropolitan regions as well as ones that affect the metropolis itself. The regional perspective marks an important shift in policy direction for at least three reasons. First, it recognises that cities grow, oftentimes in unpredictable ways that render obsolete traditional conceptions of urban boundaries. Consider the social, economic, and geographic linkages between Boston and New York, or New York and New Jersey and Connecticut. Or between New York and Philadelphia, or Philadelphia and Washington, or Washington and Baltimore. As much as any one of these cities has a unique and insular urban culture, so does this formidable coastal megalopolis, whose multi-regional identity crosses more boundaries and more levels of governance than one cares to count. Second, the regional perspective signals a response to these dynamics on a federal level, a political gesture so foreign to American cities, so counterintuitive after years of painfully inadequate self-governance, that many an urban theorist, most notably Jane Jacobs, has convincingly argued for greater urban autonomy as an alternative to quietly suffering de facto abandonment at hands of the national government. Finally, it's worth mentioning that this style of urban policy represents a spectacularly overdue return to form for the Democratic party, which spinelessly gave up on cities just as much as Republican administrations sadistically mistreated them. This holds true even when measured against the veritable yardsticks from Democratic party history like Lyndon Johnson's Model Cities programme. There, the emphasis on coordinating existing programmes and funding local urban planning initiatives reinforced the central city mindset even as suburban subdivisions spread like drug-resistant bacteria over America's unsuspecting corpus. Meanwhile, the new cabinet-level department of housing and urban development (HUD) barely got to see the light of day before the Nixon administration stripped it of responsibility, reducing it (and the idea of urban development) to a political albatross. By the time the Newt Gingrich-controlled House of Representatives attempted to abolish it altogether, the \"UD\" portion of the maligned acronym had long ago became a phonetic formality: in fin-de-siecle America, urban policy had resoundingly come to mean one thing: housing \u2013 promoting home ownership to the haves, and public housing development for the have-nots with undetermined success (see: New Orleans, Post-Katrina; Crisis, National Mortgage). Given this history, it should be noted that Obama's administrative changes do not constitute a revolution, especially in the absence of radiant linguistic packages like Kennedy's New Frontier and Johnson's Great Society. But creating a White House office that reports directly to the president and revives HUD from its depressed slumber are more likely than not to help with the implementation of Obama's specific proposals. The needs of urban centres and metropolitan regions are obvious (infrastructure improvements, job creation, assuring sustainable development of transportation and housing), and big city mayors, many of whom have shown themselves to be capable administrators at a time of failed federal leadership, deserve access to dedicated federal funding to shore up the economic and cultural might of cities where poverty, public health and overdevelopment continue to threaten the livelihood of millions. Obama seems to recognise that the concept of the American dream is in dire need of a little breathing room and some conceptual upgrading. Few people need any more rhetorical reminders that they're after it, but most of us could use a better roadmap with more alternate routes - including bike paths! A real federal urban policy? In the public transportation system of any great society, it's the first stop to a new and better frontier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
