It is understood that the US billionaire has revived his interest in buying the club after negotiations with Ellis broke down last week at Villa Park, and the owner of the Cleveland Browns American Football team continues to believe that he holds the key to O'Neill's appointment. O'Neill is understood to be surprised by reports in the local press indicating he is ready to be introduced as the manager. It was suggested that the Irishman would be confirmed as David O'Leary's successor yesterday or today. Within Lerner's group there is also a sense of disbelief given the lack of progress over talks. \"The idea of O'Neill joining camp with Ellis in charge is completely off the wall,\" said a source. Villa responded to yesterday's stories linking O'Neill with the post by insisting that no appointment was imminent. \"Contrary to rumours circulating there is no announcement planned concerning the appointment of a new manager,\" said Steve Stride, the operations director. \"The situation remains ongoing and we will inform fans as and when it is possible. But speculation concerning an announcement is extremely premature.\" It is apparent that O'Neill has been offered the Villa position, although it is believed he will require unequivocal assurances about any takeover before deciding to commit. O'Neill is not prone to making rash decisions and his circumspection over the uncertainty surrounding the club's ownership is understandable. The picture would become a lot clearer should Lerner's second attempt to gain control be successful. There remains the possibility of a deal being resurrected, although under vastly different terms to before. This time, unlike last Wednesday, there will be no face-to-face meeting. Instead Lerner would leave any transaction in the hands of the two banks involved. The American was left bemused by his earlier meeting with Ellis, when he arrived with the intention of making an offer subject to due diligence, and would not countenance the possibility of enduring another frustrating experience. None of the other parties interested, including the consortiums headed by Athole Still, Michael Neville and Nicholas Padfield QC, have dropped out of the running but it has become increasingly clear that Lerner offers the surest route to progress and O'Neill's arrival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
