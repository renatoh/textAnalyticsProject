Certainly Arsenal are in the quarter-finals because in Sylvain Wiltord they have found the French answer to Jack Dawkins, the artful dodger. Yesterday Wiltord came off the bench here to score twice in the last quarter-hour and win a sixth-round tie that Chelsea briefly threatened to steal from under Arsenal's noses. With five goals in the competition so far Wiltord is fast becoming the talisman who could take Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team over the Severn Bridge to this season's final in Cardiff. At times it was difficult to believe that Chelsea had come to Highbury as FA Cup holders. For much of the game they performed with the world-weary passivity of players who had long since given up the idea of winning even a raffle on the road. Chelsea's sole victory away from Stamford Bridge this season remains their fourth-round Cup win at Gillingham. Yesterday Claudio Ranieri sent out a team to contain Arsenal and by the time his attack had acquired the extra pace of Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jesper Gronkjaer it was merely to chase the game. Though Arsenal were well worth their victory Wenger will be relieved to have got away with having to pick a defence that, at least on paper, appeared to be made more of straw than bricks. With Martin Keown and Silvinho injured and Tony Adams suspended the Arsenal manager was forced to play Oleg Luzhny, a full-back, at centre-back alongside the ponderous Igor Stepanovs. At Dynamo Kiev Luzhny was called \"the horse\" and though it is not known if Latvians ever christened Stepanovs \"the cart\" the potential danger this pair faced in the speed of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink appeared Chelsea's best chance of taking an early grip on the tie. Ranieri, however, seemed more concerned initially with holding the opposition in midfield. Given Patrick Vieira's dominance between the penalty areas the Chelsea coach did have a case but with the suspended Ray Parlour another Arsenal absentee Ranieri might have done worse than start with Gronkjaer, especially on the form the Dane had shown against Manchester United a week earlier. The delayed introduction of Gudjohnsen also eased the pressure on Arsenal's odd couple at centre-back, a point emphasised when the Icelander struck a post with a bicycle kick two minutes after Hasselbaink had brought the scores level with the best goal of the afternoon. \"That was the turning point,\" Ranieri shrugged afterwards. \"If we had scored then I think we would have won. Arsenal would have been forced to come forward more and we would have hit them on the break.\" True perhaps, although the feeling persisted that Chelsea would have done better had their coach's second thoughts been his first. Then again the last two coaches to win the FA Cup at Chelsea, Ruud Gullit and Gianluca Vialli, have both been sacked so maybe Ranieri knew what he was doing. The way Wenger's players were consistently first to the ball and raced forward in large numbers to support an attack when they were not defending in depth did not suggest a team due to play a Champions League game against Lyon in midweek with a visit to Manchester United four days later. With Lauren feeding off Vieira and both looking to release Robert Pires on the left Chelsea were on the back foot from the outset and rather fortunate that Dennis Bergkamp had a goal disallowed in the second minute for a push after Pires had taken the ball off Albert Ferrer. Not until the approach of half-time did Chelsea achieve anything of note, if one can call bookings notable. Celestine Babayaro soured the game by fouling Fredrik Ljungberg and kicking out at Bergkamp. Dennis Wise then became involved in confrontations with Vieira and Pires which led to a minute or two of massed shoving before Hasselbaink, Wise and Thierry Henry were cautioned. \"I felt there were certain moments when a number of players were happy to stay on the pitch,\" Wenger observed diplomatically. \"They needed to put on boxing gloves,\" Ranieri smiled, but apparently did not see Babayaro taking a swing at Lauren. Fortunately for Babayaro neither did the referee Graham Barber. Having replaced Sam Dalla Bona, Gronkjaer's first significant act was to give away a penalty by pushing Lauren away from Henry's centre, Henry himself putting Arsenal ahead with the kick. Until then Chelsea had done nothing to suggest they might be capable of drawing level, but just past the hour Gustavo Poyet and Gudjohnsen worked the ball to Hasselbaink, who from the penalty arc beat David Seaman with a superb right-footed shot. Gudjohnsen's near-miss followed, whereupon Wenger replaced Pires with Wiltord, who proceeded to win the tie. In the 73rd minute he flicked a long ball from Stepanovs, which Marcel Desailly had failed to intercept, past the advancing Carlo Cudicini and in the 85th the dodger scored simply after Lauren had left Babayaro and Gronkjaer in all of a twist to set up the chance. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
