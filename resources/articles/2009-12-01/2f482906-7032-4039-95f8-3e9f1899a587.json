There were 13,378 assaults reported in 2008-09 by Jobcentre Plus staff, of which 12,188 were verbal and 896 were attempted physical assaults. There were 294 actual assaults, almost one a day. Jobcentre Plus employs nearly 70,000 staff, meaning nearly one in every five may have experienced abuse of some kind. The figures were released in answers to parliamentary questions tabled by the Conservatives. Jobcentre Plus is a government agency supporting people from welfare into work and helping employers fill vacancies. The government had planned to make efficiency savings, but was criticised for closures as the country entered recession. The government subsequently boosted numbers working to deal with the newly unemployed but the Tories said the figures of abuse directed at Jobcentre Plus staff were evidence of the folly of closures. Jobcentre Plus spends \u00a340m a year employing 1,600 security staff. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Theresa May, said: \"These are shocking figures. \"Jobcentre staff are doing their best in very difficult circumstances with centres coming under increasing pressure because of rising benefit claims during the recession. \"However, some of the blame for this lies at the door of the government. Their irresponsible decision to close a jobcentre every week during 2008, when unemployment was rising, has put an unbearable strain on staff.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
