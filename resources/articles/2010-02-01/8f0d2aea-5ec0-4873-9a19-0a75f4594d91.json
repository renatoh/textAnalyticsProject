Chelsea, often on the attack, would have merited a draw on a night where they endured disadvantages and the exasperating loss of their goalkeeper Petr Cech to a peculiar calf injury in the second half. He hardly appeared even to land awkwardly after collecting a routine cross. Initial reports of cruciate-ligament damage are categorically denied by the club and it will be a relief if he can return soon. Chelsea will not want to place too many hopes in the little-known hands of Henrique Hil\u00e1rio, though the substitute at least kept a clean sheet in about half an hour of action. That quiet spell came as a surprise. No one is ever permitted to ignore the former Chelsea manager Mourinho and the incumbent, Carlo Ancelotti, has his own renown, yet the delight came at San Siro in a spectacle that destroyed the illusion that coaches always shape the course of events. There were tactical tweaks aplenty from Mourinho, but talent on the pitch had a greater say. Indeed, this was the sort of uproarious game that has never been anticipated on any coach's whiteboard. Internazionale moved ahead after three minutes. With Ashley Cole and Yuri Zhirkov both injured, Ancelotti had brooded over the candidates for Chelsea's vacancy at left-back and opted for the winger Florent Malouda, who had experience of the post at Lyon. Perhaps everyone had been too preoccupied with the topic because Inter erupted on the other flank. The visitors seemed utterly unprepared as Diego Milito cut inside, went across John Terry and scored with a low shot that beat Cech too easily at the near post. Self-disgust over such a lapse seemed to galvanise Chelsea. The attacks were sustained, despite Nicolas Anelka being below par, and no one could pretend that Inter had cunningly contained the danger. A 30-yard free-kick from the outstanding Didier Drogba struck the crossbar at a ferocious velocity after 14 minutes. Yet many in Chelsea's ranks would know how signs of encouragement can prove false around Mourinho. The Portuguese had the ideas and means to unsettle Chelsea. Terry was troubled by Milito. In addition, Inter have more verve this season after reinvesting the funds raised by the sale of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona. It allowed for the purchase of Wesley Sneijder, whose stylishness was sustained during the first half in particular. Inter's advantage ought to have been doubled in the 34th minute. Walter Samuel swept a fine pass to the left and Sneijder's low ball went towards the far post, where Samuel Eto'o missed his kick embarrassingly before Terry cleared. The home side were not so constantly masterful and Chelsea could have had an invitation to level the score at the end of the first half. The referee Manuel Mejuto Gonz\u00e1lez was indifferent to the appeals when it looked clear that Samuel had felled Salomon Kalou inside the penalty area. Chelsea hardly required additional motivation but the incident intensified the emotions. Given the identity of the Inter manager, drama and for that matter melodrama were to be anticipated. Mourinho had decried Ancelotti as an establishment figure, so burnishing his self-conferred reputation as a radical. The Portuguese's revolutionary purpose is hard to identify. You could mistake him for a person who craves vast wealth and attention. Picturing himself as an outsider is a self-motivational technique. He may be blocking out the fact that he works for one of the grand institutions of the sport, the sole Italian club to be ever-present in Serie A. Still, it cannot be too hard to be so embedded in the establishment when a game can still be as enthralling as this. The Inter manager could scarcely claim to have dictated the events that filled the opening phase of the second half. In the 51st minute Chelsea equalised after Mikel John Obi had set Branislav Ivanovic free. The full-back's low ball was taken by Kalou and curled into the net, with the goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar seeming a little uneasy. Inter had regained the lead within four minutes. Sneijder delivered from the left and although Esteban Cambiasso's first shot was blocked by Ivanovic the ball broke back to the midfielder, who finished at the second attempt. Whatever is said about the sophistication of Mourinho and Ancelotti, this was not always a night in which a masterplan was being unfurled. The players had notions of their own and Lampard was on the verge of a goal after build-up play by Drogba and Anelka, but his drive was saved by C\u00e9sar. This taxing match had stimulated Chelsea and paved the way for an engrossing return. Kevin Mitchell, page 2"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
