Smartly marshalled archive footage finds the sweet spot between gawping at carnage and contextualising it within the sport's painful evolution; the thrills of well-timed overtaking manoeuvres are set against the horror of men being roasted alive. Eventually, 1: Life on the Limit must arrive at Senna, San Marino, and the moment when, after decades of (crucially, untelevised) destruction, racing was forced to lift its visor and take a hard look at itself \u2013 yet Crowder's film is now equally haunted by Michael Schumacher's presence in a way that furthers its thesis: as F1 tightens up on safety, might the real speedfreaks be driven towards potentially deadlier pursuits?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
