The thing is, I stretched the truth during my interview and said that I'd got a 2.1, when, in fact, I only achieved a third. Nobody bothered to check and I got away with it, and have been doing well since. But the company has now been caught short by someone in this year's intake and management has said that they are going to check the academic results of everybody hired in the past two years. What should I do? Your chances of getting out of this with more than you deserve will be greatly helped if you learn one lesson. Stop the euphemisms. What do you mean, you stretched the truth? Turning a third-class degree into a 2.1 isn't stretching anything: it's a lie. You haven't yet admitted that, even to yourself. Try saying it now, out loud: \"I lied.\" All will now depend on two things. First, on how well you've done. A degree may help people get their first job but after that, for most, it has little value. After that, people are judged not on promise but on performance. This fact might just save you. If your performance has been as good as they hoped from someone with a 2.1, you have a chance. Second, come clean. No weasel words, no wheedling attempts to mitigate your fib. Under no circumstances uses phrases such as \"stretching the truth\". Tell them you badly wanted the job: so badly that you lied about your degree. Tell them you were confident, given the opportunity, that you could prove your value - and you hope that you have. Tell them you're mortified. And promise them that, since you joined, you've told no other lie, big or small; and nor will you ever. Volunteer all this right away - and if your record is good enough, you might just get away with it. If you do, I suspect your determination will be greater than ever. Your company might even reach the same conclusion - and that could work in your favour. I'm not sure you deserve it, but good luck, anyway. I have an editor's role - but without the pay or the job title I am an editorial assistant in a publishing company, but for the past year I have been working as a desk editor (a role involving much more skill and responsibility). This is unofficially recognised by my colleagues and, since I am good at my work, I assumed a change in job title would come sooner or later. The person who recruited me has since left, and I have twice asked my new boss to be considered for promotion - a small step up to assistant editor. My boss is sympathetic and complimentary, but says there is nothing she can do on account of \"departmental structuring\". She hints that my best option is to move on - although good editorial posts come up once in a blue moon, and editorial assistants are ten a penny. I suspect my employers want me to continue in my role without recognition or increased pay, in the expectation that when I leave, they will find another unwary recruit to fill my shoes. Sadly, I plan to change careers in the next year (potential payrise notwithstanding, I am tired of living on under \u00a316k a year) but I still want something to show for my efforts and put on my CV. I continue to like my boss and enjoy my work, but feel increasingly angry and upset. I know I can't force the company to promote me but is there a way of registering my frustration that doesn't make me seem a bitter trouble-maker? Two things intrigue me. First, your intention, revealed towards the end of your letter, to change careers in the course of the next year. And second, the fact that you've taken this decision with sadness. It sounds as if, reluctantly, you plan to move from publishing, which you enjoy, to another less attractive trade purely for the money. I know this isn't what you asked me about; but if that's, indeed, what you have in mind, please think very carefully. I know that good editorial posts are hard to come by and that there's a lot of redundancy about at the moment; but you've acquired several years of experience in a field you like and you know you're good at what you do. It seems a bit of a waste to chuck all that in. My instinct is that you should do everything you can to stay in publishing while making some progress on status and salary: either with your existing company or with another in the same line of business. And that, of course, makes it even more important that you get proper acknowledgment for the job you've been doing over the past year. The first thing you must do is cool it. However justified you may be in feeling angry and upset, you're much more likely to get what you want if you present your case with sweet reason - and an understanding of your boss's perspective. If you imply what you suggest to me - that your company is deliberately denying you recognition in the belief that you'll finally flounce out - you'll do your case no good at all. The good news is that you still like your boss and that she continues to like your work. Everything suggests that she's under pressure from her own boss to keep costs down: that's surely what all this \"departmental structuring\" rhubarb is really about. So, when you go back to your sympathetic boss, don't talk money; just hand her a written request that your year's work be recognised by the title of assistant editor. It's a reasonable request - and it won't affect her budget. And even if it doesn't lead to a raise at next salary review time, it will give your CV the extra qualification you've obviously earned. \u00b7 Jeremy Bullmore writes a column for Management Today, in which some of these questions first appeared.
