And Hill has been quite overawed by the commitment of many people who work in the housing sector. They seem to live, eat and breathe housing. It's not just a job for them. \"People involved in housing, in my experience as a housing minister and as a human being, really care. They are extraordinary people, dedicated and almost preoccupied with housing. They are now reacting to the new momentum and the political impetus coming from government.\" And that political impetus has been huge. As far as government budgets are concerned, housing is the last of the big spenders. Hill points out that it was also one of the last to get going, but he is proud that it is currently a political priority and is getting the money the sector so badly needs. \"We are now spending twice the budget we inherited in 1997,\" Hill says. \"Growth in housing investment has been a gradual process but we are now in a new big spend. What we are hoping for now is a new big delivery.\" Hill reckons the government is well on the way to meeting its decent homes target, with the one millionth home to be brought up to standard shortly and more than 10,000 key workers on the housing ladder with government help. He has viewed much of it first hand. \"I can no longer count the number of new bathrooms, kitchens, toilets and windows I have seen,\" he says. But as the minister responsible for planning too, he is not only interested in refurbishment. He is keen on new build, with modern construction methods. \"There is a lot of good-quality design going on. The deputy prime minister talks about the 'wow factor'. There's a lot of 'wow' around and we want to see more of it. \"We are saying to the planners that if you are unhappy with the quality of the design, then reject it,\" Hill says. The government's planning reform agenda is just coming on the statute books now. But the change needs to be cultural and not just legislative. Hill insists the phrase \"development control\" and the planning ethos behind such words should be thrown on the scrapheap. \"Planning is about change and about identifying the change that is necessary and is compatible with local needs and the countryside.\" And modern, prefabricated building methods are a must wherever possible. They help because of skills shortages in key building trades and labour shortages as well as offering faster and safer delivery on new homes. \"Statistically, construction is an industry that is somewhat accident-prone. The results are much better for modern manufacturing methods,\" Hill insists. In many places new build is in addition to refurbishment of existing properties but in some cases - the housing market renewal areas, for example - demolition is making way for modern accommodation. Hill is not respon- sible for the pathfinder projects but each minister is sponsoring at least one of them. Hill has Merseyside. \"In parts of Liverpool and Bootle, you are looking at acres and acres of dereliction. The properties are more than 100 years old. Many are too small and haven't got the facilities - the inside bathrooms and toilets - that people quite reasonably depend upon.\" In some cases terraced houses are being knocked through into each other to create larger homes. But many will just be razed to the ground. All new build will be part of a wider community. The strapline for the ODPM (Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) is all about sustainable development, and Hill is an strong advocate. The days when housing was a stand-alone service, isolated from employment, health and social services, are gone within the housing professionals' world - if not yet banished from developers' minds. \"It's the developers that still have that traditional attitude. Not all, but some are still inclined to look at the bricks and mortar only. We need high levels of community involvement. The developers have to recognise that what they are proposing will affect people's lives for a long time. It's not just a hit and run job.\" Hill also suggests it would be nice if developers completed the social housing ingredient of schemes first, rather than last. But Hill does reserve some criticisms for RSLs (registered social landlords) too. There seems to be a reluctance among RSLs to manage housing stock that is integrated into wider mixed-tenure communities. Many prefer their social tenants to be in one block, which goes against Hill's - and many others' - agenda. \"What we are insistent on is mixed-tenure estates. What we would really like is the 'pepper-potting' approach, where you mix your social tenants, your intermediate and your owner-occupiers.\" And there's a noticeable change in Hill's attitude when pressed on the issue of tenants, like those in Camden, north London, who reject the government's preferred options for sorting out their housing problems - stock transfer, arms-length management organisations (Almos) or private finance initiative deals. The relaxed, chatty, man-next-door suddenly sits up and raises his voice. \"Look, 20% of Camden's 25,000 tenants voted against the Almo. What about the 80%? Why doesn't Camden go back and ask what they want? That turnout was unusually low and the 'no' vote was unusually high. I accept that Defend Council Housing put up a far more high-profile campaign and that there was considerable hostility from the local paper, but out of the five unitary councils with three stars for their housing, four are already getting on with Almos. \"We have no intention of getting rid of council housing per se. Under the Almo, the properties remain in the ownership of the council and the tenants remain tenants of the council. But the government is very reluctant to pour money into councils that are not performing.\" And with that Hill relaxes again. The housing minister comes across, like most people working in the sector, as a man thoroughly enjoying his job.
