In a space no bigger than 15ft square, huge, frothy, white rambling roses tangled with colourful clematis and bumper honeysuckles. They bordered and crossed the garden via chunky poles linked by thick rope. The climbers recommended for small gardens are usually timid things, but with a bit of DIY, you can create height to cater for the big beasts. This made me think. I have a preformed structure in the shape of my willow tree, which could support a brute of a plant, such as a towering honeysuckle, to send clouds of fragrance across the neighbourhood. For advice on which variety to go for, I went to Louisa Arbuthnott, of climber specialists Stone House Cottage Garden and Nursery, Worcestershire (01562 69902; shcn.co.uk). Because honeysuckle scent is strongest at night, she advised me to choose one that flowers around this time of year, when the evenings are warm. For my moist conditions, she recommends Lonicera similis delavayi: semievergreen with delicate white flowers and a fabulous scent. For a dry soil, L. etrusca 'Superba' fits the bill, with yellow flowers that have a hint of pink and a strong scent. For less space, the best scented of the more manageable summer-flowering honeysuckles are L. \u00d7 americana and the yellow and white L. periclymenum 'Munster'. Even these reach a strapping 8ft, so you will need to put up good support. But for the fragrance and privacy, it's worth the effort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
