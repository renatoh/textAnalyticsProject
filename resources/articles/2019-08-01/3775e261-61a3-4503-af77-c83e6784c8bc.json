The 36-year-old has fallen into a useful-looking set of rides at the Ascot event, notably Sapa Inca (3.25) in the Classic. From the Mark Johnston yard that had 50 winners last month, this improving filly went second close home in a big field at Glorious Goodwood after trouble in running. She can cap what could be a big day for her rider, who has been having a thin time in recent weeks. 1.05 Ascot Turner also has a fine chance in the opening Dash, aboard Lancelot Du Lac, who will be remembered for winning the Stewards\u2019 Cup under Frankie Dettori in 2017. The veteran has dropped a few pounds since then but was in good heart on the all-weather when last seen in the spring and his stable is going well now. 1.40 Ascot It was a high-class piece of form that Billy Ray put up when chasing home Withhold at Newbury and he looked the likely winner a furlong out. With Danny Tudhope aboard, he should do well in the Shergar Cup Stayers. 1.55 Haydock David O\u2019Meara does well with his imports and the ex-French Young Fire has a couple of bits of form to his name that suggest he might be nicely treated on this mark. 2.15 Ascot The Shergar Cup Challenge represents a welcome step down in class for Melting Dew, who has fared poorly in much hotter races this year. He is back down to a fair rating, the cheekpieces return and Turner may have another big chance here. 2.30 Haydock With Oisin Murphy up, Miss O Connor appeals most in this Listed race. Unbeaten in two, the ex-Irish filly is taking a big step up in class but could hardly have done better than scoring by 11 lengths on her British debut. 2.50 Ascot Andrew Balding has a fair Shergar Cup record and his Zwayyan is of interest in the Mile, having been beaten less than a couple of lengths in the race last year. He went well for a long way in the Hunt Cup, his first outing after a break. 3.05 Haydock If one horse should relish the soggy conditions here, it is Addeybb, who powered through mud to win his Lincoln last year and did so again at Royal Ascot this summer. Dettori\u2019s only mount on the card is Wissahickon, who has a lot to prove in such conditions. 3.45 Newmarket Charlie Appleby can win his first Sweet Solera with the talented Light Blush. The first foal of a dual Listed winner, she won handily on her debut here and then was second in a Sandown Listed race to a horse on which Dettori delivered a fine ride from the front. 4.00 Ascot Another Balding contender on this card is Hero Hero, who was overstretched by a mile here at the Royal meeting but had previously impressed at Chester and looks the right type for the Sprint."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
