The former England captain spent the last few months of the season on loan at San Siro and is due to return to the United States to resume playing with LA Galaxy in mid-July. However, the 34-year-old has spoken with the national coach Fabio Capello and has been left under no illusions that he must be featuring regularly in a competitive European league if he is to secure a place in the Italian's squad to compete at next summer's World Cup finals in South Africa. Whether Milan will opt to secure him on a longer-term basis next season remains to be seen, particularly following the manager Carlo Ancelotti's departure to Chelsea. \"It has not been finalised although Milan are one of the clubs that have shown an interest,\" said Beckham. \"Nothing has been finalised but I will definitely be coming back to Europe though because of the World Cup. The manager [Capello] has always said to me, 'Wherever you go, play at the highest level'. Most places in Europe are at the top level.\" Tottenham Hotspur, who have tried three times to secure his services in the past and whose manager Harry Redknapp has declared his admiration for the midfielder, would represent his likeliest destination within the Premier League with the veteran having proved his fitness while helping secure Champions League football for Milan. Beckham has paid tribute to the techniques adopted while with the Rossoneri for prolonging his career. \"It has made a big difference,\" said Beckham, who played his first 90 minutes for England since the 2006 World Cup finals against Andorra on Wednesday. \"More than anything, the sharpness of the training \u2013 it isn't anything to do with diet but the work rate and the way Milan work is superb. \"Carlo Ancelotti had one of the biggest influences with the team and the fitness and the regimes we had there. It will carry on without a doubt without him but it is one of the best clubs I have been with fitness-wise and professionalism-wise. It has been good. I will be going back to America and will be playing 10 or 11 games, so I don't think the manager [Capello] will be worried about that. He will be thinking about where I will be going in December, though.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
