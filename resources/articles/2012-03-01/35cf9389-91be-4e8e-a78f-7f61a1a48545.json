The 27-year-old will be included in a 32-man elite training squad to be announced by the England coach, Steve McNamara, on Tuesday morning but will then head for Leeds to answer a charge of dangerous use of a forearm on the Bradford stand-off Ben Jeffries in the Wolves' 23-10 Super League winat Odsal on Saturday night \u2013 even though the incident was deemed worthy of no more than a caution by the match referee, Thierry Alibert. If found guilty, Bridge will be suspended for one or two matches, which would add to Warrington's problems ahead of the televised game at Leeds on Friday night, given injury concerns over Michael Monaghan and Ben Westwood, who both missed the Bradford game. McNamara is expected to call up a number of new faces who were in the England Knights development squad last season, including the Leeds centre Kallum Watkins, in addition to confirming England's fixtures through to the World Cup on home soil in the autumn of 2013. They will play two games in June and July against the Exiles team drawn from the overseas players employed in the Super League, after losing the first International Origin match at Headingley last summer. But with Australia and New Zealand refusing to play any internationals at the end of this season, England will instead face Wales and France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
