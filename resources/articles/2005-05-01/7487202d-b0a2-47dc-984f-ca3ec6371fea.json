Amid the pomp of this old town institution - a place where wealthy Italians stay for family beachside holidays; where Murano chandeliers line the corridors, and where a child called Federico Fellini once peeped through the hedges to get a glimpse of 1930s grandeur - a young Italian bellboy spotted two twentysomethings after a different kind of holiday. And so he took time out from hauling luggage to impart his secret to us: that Friday night in Rimini was \"big party night.\" That it would all be going on at a club called Byblos. That \"everybody will be there\". And that we were, of course, invited to join him. More than that - we would be fools to miss out. Unmissable nights out in Rimini? It sounded unlikely. Party town isn't the reputation that precedes this Italian seaside destination. It was a popular in 1970s, but has belatedly lost its appeal to overseas tourists. So much so that before my short break there, the more I heard about the place, the more anxious I became. One friend recalled Rimini was \"a bit grim,\" while another sneered, \"even the name sounds dirty\". More troubling were the analogies that kept surfacing. Take this description I stumbled across on one website: \"Rimini is one of the least pretentious towns in Italy, with a reputation for good fun that puts it on a par with Blackpool or Torremolinos.\" That's damning with faint praise if I ever heard it. Unpretentious is one thing - a bit tacky is another. Yet something is happening in Rimini that will put the naysayers in their place. The good times are returning to the province - and the young, stylish fashion set with them. Design hotels are popping up across the region along with destination clubs and oversubscribed beach parties. If you steer clear of the bulk of the seafront, with its naff bucket-and-spade, amusement-arcade ethos, you can get a taste of why Italians are increasingly hailing it as their answer to Ibiza. Which is how I found myself being ushered on to a table at 3am, perilously close to a floodlit swimming pool but dancing recklessly nonetheless. This is Byblos - one of Rimini's three big-name clubs (the others are Pascia and Villa Delle Rose) on the opening night of the season. Our informer was right - everybody was there. The place was packed, with the crowds sashaying around the pool or dancing in the open-air courtyard of this villa-converted club complex. The atmosphere was like a huge house party, with a barbecue bar, friendly crowd and danceable pop pumping into the warm evening air. Our companion was not, I should add, the bellboy, but Matteo Sornani - Rimini's male version of Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. He knows everybody (every bar we entered we were treated to a chorus of backslapping and \"Ciao Matteo\") and is central to the region's rejuvenated party scene. He started the Grand's Sunday night summer beach parties, tickets to which are hot property throughout July and August. You are guaranteed entry if you're staying in the Grand - otherwise you have to call ahead to ask for an invite (they claim to be open-minded about this, but I get the feeling the old and the ugly need not apply). At the end of the night, when the sun has gone down, everybody jumps, fully-clothed, into the pool - a fate I pleasingly managed to avoid at Byblos. There is another venture on the cards for Sornani, too. He is soon to be director of NoMi, a bar/club with an enviable location in Rimini's cobbled old town. Unlike the big clubs - which you need to either drive or taxi to - it will be within stumbling distance of the hub of bars that now occupy the converted old fish market, the best place to see and be seen enjoying your pre-club apperativos. Attached to NoMi will be the new DuoMo design hotel. Ron Arad is designing both, so they are set to make a stylish entrance on to the scene (so stylish, in fact, that they are turning up fashionably late to the party, since delayed building works mean they won't now be ready until at least September). But there remains an air of great anticipation about both of them. Rimini is one hour from Bologna and three from Milan, if you are driving Italian-style (ie fast). For that reason, it is considered a great weekend destination for the city-based Italian fashionistas, who hare down to the coast for a taste of the sun, sea and relaxation. Another popular pastime is the shopping, since factory outlets for a number of major Italian labels are dotted around the area. Many of the big names - like MaxMara and Fuzzi - have their own outlets, and several Italian women I spoke to swear by making a special trip to these cut-price shopping haunts, although the few I visited were a bit Nancy Dell'Olio for my taste. Yet, as a cheap weekend break it remains less well-known among twenty- and thirtysomething Brits, who have yet to catch on to the improved nightlife, or register that it also has all the advantages you'd associate with Italy - good food, wine and weather - that also make for a cheap and charming getaway. You're only a short drive from the wine-producing hills of San Giovanni in Marignano. At Tenuta del Monsignore, a vineyard dating back to the 17th century, you can taste and buy the local wines alongside olive oil and honey. Owner Sandro Bacchini is the 12th generation of producer and was pleasingly proud of his bottles (or \"children\" as he called them). When I helped myself to my second glass of his wonderful prosecco - which cost all of \u20ac4 a bottle - he patted his stomach and proclaimed himself \"very pleased\". I could only lament that Ryanair were not more generous with luggage allowance, otherwise I would have taken it home by the crate. You can also line your stomach for a big night by eating in Montefiore Conca, a pretty hilltop village with a 14th-century fortress from which you have an uninterrupted view of the province of Rimini. With the curvaceous hillside and red-tiled roofs, I felt as far away from Blackpool or Torremolinos as I possibly could. My lunch at Loncanda della Corona, a Michelin-recommended restaurant which serves local cheeses, home-made pasta and hearty meat dishes, was a world away from the stick-of-rock cuisine that that seaside-town smear suggested I'd get. But if even that is too much effort for post-club chilling, I couldn't think of a better place to wake up than the Riviera Golf Resort. Just one year old, and already turning away business, visiting DJs tend to stop over here in one of the 32 individually-designed urban-style suites. You can play golf if you like, but why bother, when you can lounge around beside the 82-metre pool and eat in the perfectly minimalist white restaurant? I was grateful for their spa, since the massage I had there went some way towards evicting the toxins I'd ploughed into my body the night before. The last Friday of the month they, too, host a party - which I wasn't surprised to learn since the place left me feeling so relaxed I was suddenly ready to hit the dance floor all over again. Pascia (pronounced the same as Pasha, but nothing to do with that Ibizan club) has just reopened near Cattolica after four years and an expensive makeover. You can spot the place by the queue of cars that snakes down the road from the entrance (drink-driving is a worrying non-issue in these parts). Like Byblos, the average age is much older than you would find in many British or Ibizan clubs - 25-35 is the norm. It's not that younger people aren't allowed in, just that Italians are more self-selecting in their clubbing. Younger people don't want to go where older people are - and the prices (\u20ac10 a drink) are expensive enough for them to not bother exercising their curiosity with the odd visit. The result is a more sophisticated but also more serious venue. House music pumps from the speakers and dancing girls prance about on podiums in their next-to-nothing uniforms. It is not yet a tourist attraction in itself, as the place seems populated with only Italians, with the dress code being anything that would have been fashionable circa 1980. As I watched the short skirts and slick hair waft past me to the dance floor, I couldn't help thinking this was Rimini all over. You know the style is there somewhere - you just have to look beneath the surface for it.
