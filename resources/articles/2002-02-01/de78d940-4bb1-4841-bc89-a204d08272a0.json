Wilkinson kicked four penalties and a conversion as the Falcons made the better of rotten conditions at Headingley. Leeds, on the other hand, were unable to come to terms with the filthy pitch and the swirling rain and remain rooted to the bottom of the Zurich Premiership table. This was never going to be a classic - the weather saw to that - but in Wilkinson Newcastle had the one player with the vision and the know-how to adapt his game in order to ensure his side came out on top. The first half was simply a battle of the kickers, Wilkinson outscoring his opposite number Braam van Straaten by four penalties to three. And for all that Leeds enjoyed the majority of possession, they were unable to find a way through the well-organised visiting defence. On the rare occasions when opportunities arose they let themselves down with silly handling errors. For that reason one has to feel sorry for their scrum-half Scott Benton who tried his heart out, produced some incisive, darting breaks but lacked support from a back-line that included both Van Straaten and his fellow South African Test player Japie Mulder on his Tykes debut. The hosts were made to pay for their attacking ineffectiveness as, seven minutes after the interval, Newcastle collected the only try of the game. The hooker Steve Brotherstone, on his Falcons debut having signed on loan from Northampton last week, found Stuart Grimes with his lineout throw and the Newcastle pack did the rest, forcing the replacement lock over the try line. Wilkinson duly converted and then proceeded to close the game down. He made sure that Leeds were penned in their own 22 as he played the percentages game to perfection, keeping the Tykes on the back foot with a clutch of accurate, raking kicks. Leeds were unable to find an answer, as their director of rugby Phil Davies readily acknowledged. \"Jonny played very well for them. They employed an excellent kicking game and, while we played some good rugby, we were too far away from their line to hurt them,\" he admitted. The Newcastle director of rugby Rob Andrew, who saw his side move up to fourth place as a consequence of victory, agreed with Davies. \"Jonny was outstanding for us; the way he kicked and managed the game was excellent,\" he said. \"To be honest he was fighting himself not to play that way, it was just not the sort of game he would usually want to employ. But I think his tactical appreciation in appalling conditions was spot on. \"He has the technical expertise to carry out any sort of game we chose to play.\" And Andrew added: \"I know it wasn't the prettiest of games but you could do very little with the ball out there. We decided that possession was the most important thing and we knew as long as we kept our discipline and defended well Leeds would be able to do very little from 60 or 70 yards.\" Andrew was right, Leeds could not cope and Davies is well aware that the clock is ticking against them as they look to preserve their status in the top flight. \"We were under no illusions when we got promoted at the end of last season. We knew it was going to be tough and that is exactly what it is. But we have to move on from this defeat and stay focused. We can't work any harder than we are and we now have nine more matches to try and make sure we can get out of the position we are in.\" Leeds: Scarbrough; Hall, Davies (Woof, 65min), Mulder, Emmerson; Van Straaten, Benton; Shelley, Rawlinson, Kerr, C Murphy (P Murphy, 65min), Palmer, Hogg, Hyde, Seaunati.
