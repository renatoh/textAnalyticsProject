For the first time in three months he was allowed to send out a runner, having had his right to make entries suspended as punishment for administering a banned substance to a horse. But anyone monitoring recent activity at his Seven Barrows stable, near Lambourn, would have noticed little difference from how things have been at a similar stage of previous years. Yesterday all was peace and tranquillity. The only sound came from the open door to Henderson's office, where the trainer was taking calls from his owners. The message to most of them was similar \u2013 your horse just needs a little more time and some rain before we send him to the track. In common with most major jumps trainers Henderson's fallow period generally runs into early autumn and it will be a month at least before he is running significant numbers of horses. In that context his three-month suspension seems less severe. According to figures produced by Timeform he has previously averaged a mere 15 runners and three winners between 11 July and 10 October. \"We're all very much looking forward to the season, which, for us, normally starts at this time of year,\" he said yesterday. \"And it's not going to start until we get some rain anyway. I mean, we've got a few to run [on the current firmer going] but not a lot.\" The punishment meted out by the British Horseracing Authority may not have hurt Henderson's career but it has certainly hurt his feelings. In his first public response he said last week that he had been \"treated like a criminal\" and spoke of \"the worst experience I've ever had\". The BHA has offered no rejoinder and the trainer is now refusing to enter into any further discussion of the subject, with the aim of putting it behind him. On all known form the racing industry will be happy to let him do so \u2013 after all, as Henderson could justly complain, the jockey Fergal Lynch was not even given a formal suspension when he confessed earlier this year to the much greater offence of having \"stopped\" a horse. Moonlit Path, the mare who tested positive for tranexamic acid after carrying the Queen's colours at Huntingdon in February, is no longer in the yard. Following four runs in which she failed to achieve a place she was retired as a hopeless case. Henderson has also parted company with James Main, the vet who administered the drug, a clotting agent, to Moonlit Path and then refused to attend the BHA's inquiry. But there is no attempt to shift blame for the episode \u2013 the trainer accepts that he ordered TA to be used, though he claims he did so only to protect the horse from the effects of internal bleeding. There are no other notable absentees from Seven Barrows and Henderson says he has not lost a single owner. He is especially proud to have retained Her Majesty's patronage, despite the Moonlit Path embarrassment, and has taken delivery of a youngster called Morecambe, who will carry the royal colours this winter. He expressed cautious hope yesterday that he could conjure a big effort in the Cheltenham Gold Cup from Barbers Shop, another of the five horses he trains for the Queen. Only seven when well beaten in the race last season, Barbers Shop is said by the trainer to have \"done really, really well physically and he's much, much stronger\". Henderson also spoke of high hopes for his trio of Champion Hurdle candidates, Punjabi, Binocular and Zaynar. At Seven Barrows it is as though the last three months had never happened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
