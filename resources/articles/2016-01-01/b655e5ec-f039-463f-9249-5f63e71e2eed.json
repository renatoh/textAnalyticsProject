Alli\u2019s wonder strike at Crystal Palace earned Tottenham a fine win, having gone behind in the first half following an own goal by Jan Vertonghen. The game was poised at 1-1 after a Harry Kane equaliser when three golden touches from Alli produced what could be the goal of the season, a volley from 20 yards that left mouths gaping. Brendan Rodgers, the former Liverpool manager, claimed last week he almost signed Alli from MK Dons before the midfielder moved to Spurs. Pochettino said players often speak with a number of clubs before settling on a decision, saying Messi came close to joining Barcelona\u2019s city rivals Espanyol at 17. \u201cDo you know how many players in football are close to signing for many clubs,\u201d said Pochettino, whose son Sebastiano \u2013 a sports scientist \u2013 was sat behind the Spurs dugout on Saturday. \u201cDele Alli, it\u2019s impossible to speak about that because maybe different clubs are close to signing Dele Alli, it\u2019s like Harry Kane, it\u2019s like different players, it\u2019s only one comment from some manager. Dele Alli now is here. \u201cWe were close at Espanyol to signing Lionel Messi. Messi was 17 years old, playing for the under-18s and was very close to signing for Espanyol. It was close but it never happened.\u201d On Alli\u2019s strike, he said: \u201cI prefer that he scores goals like today, it was fantastic. We try to push the players to try. To do whatever they can. You never can stop the quality that they have, they have natural skills to play football and you need to give them a professional side but cannot stop natural talent because they are very creative.\u201d Alli\u2019s goal with six minutes remaining ensured Tottenham extended their lead over fifth-placed Manchester United to five points. Nacer Chadli also had a major impact on the game, crossing for Kane to head in the equaliser before scoring a screamer himself in injury time from 25 yards. The winger said: \u201cDele is always scoring volleys in training. He\u2019s very good at them and practises a lot so the fact it has happened in a game is not lucky. It was a fantastic goal, unbelievable. \u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed with him. He is still young but he plays like he has a lot of experience. He has a lot of potential and if he fulfils half of it he will be a great player. \u201cHe is a very skilful player and tough also, he has everything in his locker. As a young player you always have to work hard and I think he knows that. The way he is playing he is going to be picked [for England] for sure.\u201d Vertonghen has undergone scans on ankle and knee injuries sustained in a collision with the Palace striker Connor Wickham, who appeared to elbow the defender in the face. Alan Pardew said he did not see the incident but criticised Alli for a tackle on Yohan Cabaye during the second half. No Palace player has scored in the league since mid-December, and Pardew is hoping to secure a deal for Emmanuel Adebayor before the end of the January transfer window. The Wolfsburg striker Nicklas Bendtner has also been linked with a move to Palace. With Roy Hodgson in the stands to watch Alli\u2019s goal and a number of other English players on the pitch, Pardew believes things are looking bright for England at Euro 2016. The Palace manager said: \u201cWe\u2019ve produced a lot of good English players recently, it was only 18 months ago we were all moaning about where is the new talent. \u201cSuddenly we have an abundance of talent; [Oxlade-]Chamberlain, Walcott, Dele Alli, Harry Kane, Vardy. Suddenly we\u2019ve got a lot of pace and energy and if I was him [Hodgson] I\u2019d be chortling and chuckling all the way to the summer. I\u2019m sure he enjoyed the goal. He had no pressure on him today but for me it was a horrible goal.\u201d Man of the match: Dele Alli (Tottenham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
