Cuts are inevitable, but a short-term approach \u2013 simply shrinking budgets, or \"cutting the state down to size\" \u2013 will damage schools, health and welfare services. It is crucial to tackle waste and excess, but we must think carefully and radically about what public services we want, and how to deliver them more effectively. Those are the key messages from readers and contributors to the Guardian's series A New Public Services, distilled from hundreds of contributions to the debate in print and online, over the past two weeks. The series was intended to gauge perceptions of and attitudes in the public services as they prepare to move from a golden age of bumper year-on-year spending increases into a period of relative austerity. We asked Guardian writers, readers and bloggers, public servants and citizens for their views on what should be cut, what protected, and how we should deliver services in the future. It is neither scientific nor exhaustive but, from the diverse views, we have identified five key themes, which we believe reflect the core concerns and aspirations of contributors. We have expressed these as the following questions, which we've put to the three main political parties. \u2022 Trust Staff would be more motivated and productive if they were trusted more to exercise professional judgment and were less constrained by targets, paperwork and micro-management. How would you restore professional autonomy and remotivate public-services staff? \u2022 Jobs and pay There are too many unproductive jobs, too far from the frontline, and too many managers. Executive pay is too high. Where would you make staffing cuts, would you cap executive pay, and what role would there be for alternative providers, such as the private, social enterprise and voluntary sectors? \u2022 The Sure Start principle There's too much spending on services that \"pick up the pieces\" or knee-jerk policy responses to media headlines. How would you rebalance investment to encourage long-term preventive services such as Sure Start or prisoner rehabilitation schemes, and in which policy areas? \u2022 People power Too much spending reflects the needs of the providers, not the users of services. How would you incorporate user \"voice\" into the commissioning, design and provision of services? How far would you hand spending power to users \u2013 say, through individual budgets? \u2022 Scrap grandiose schemes The billions spent on national databases, such as those for children, and huge IT systems would be better spent on frontline services. PFI hospital and school building schemes should be scaled down. Do you agree? Each of the three main parties is committed to making cuts and efficiency savings in public services. But there was concern among many respondents that a crude approach to cutting billions off departmental budgets \u2013 exemplified for some readers by cuts pushed through by the Thatcher government in the 1980s \u2013 would disproportionately affect the least well-off, and store up social problems. Anger at the cause of the crisis \u2013 an out-of-control financial sector \u2013 and a sense of injustice that the poor, pensioners, ethnic minorities and unemployed teenagers will suffer most as public services shrink, were matched by a general acceptance that public spending cuts were inevitable. Some voices warned against panic, arguing that it was wiser to maintain investment and capacity and raise taxes. Others pointed out that some services had already been cut close to breaking point. But many thought the financial crisis was a big chance to tackle waste and inefficiency. There was support for the view that the bureaucratic demands of centrally imposed targets and audits meant that too many staff were employed on non-essential functions. Few called for across-the-board pay cuts, but there was a strong feeling that chief executives and top civil servants were paid too much. There is still huge support for popular institutions, such as the NHS, but there was curiosity about, and in some cases passionate support for, ideas such as personal budgets, social enterprise and \"expert patient\" self-help programmes that promise financial savings and question the notion that a centrally directed welfare state, its staff and agencies are always best placed to supply all services. But if statutory services don't hold all the answers, there was scepticism about the corporate private sector, and cynicism about markets, privatisation, choice, mega-IT projects and other centrally imposed policy fashions of recent years. There was little stomach for grand Whitehall-led policy roll-outs, or for more structural reorganisations of services. So what next? A sharp, brutal move to a \"small state\" has its vociferous supporters on the Guardian blogs. Other voices see change as a progressive re-ordering of investment priorities \u2013 spending on long-term preventive services, for example. Others located the future of many services as local and personal, through community self-help and voluntarism, and service user partnership with the professionals who provide the services. If there was anything like consensus, it was that change was necessary. One contributor wrote: \"Public service reform was too difficult in the good times.
