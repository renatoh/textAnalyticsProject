While Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal were winning impressively in Valencia courtesy of a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hat-trick, Eden Hazard scored the decisive spot-kick at Stamford Bridge after Kepa Arrizabalaga had made two saves to deny Eintracht Frankfurt in a penalty shootout. The London clubs will meet in Baku, three days before Liverpool take on Tottenham Hotspur in the final of the Champions League in Madrid. Maurizio Sarri, who has now steered his side to two major finals and a place in the top four of the Premier League in his first season in English football, pointed to the English clean sweep as evidence of the domestic league\u2019s excellence. \u201cHere the level is very high,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think that, to get to the final of the League Cup, we had to play against Liverpool, against Tottenham \u2013 the finalists of the Champions League \u2013 and then we played against, in my opinion, the best team in Europe in the final, Manchester City, you can understand the level here is very high. \u201cAt this moment, the Premier League is the best championship in Europe and, as a consequence, in the world. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy for an English team to arrive in the last month in a very good condition, physically, because here we play more than in the other countries. We played the match No 61 today. In Italy you can play 51 or 52 matches, but those 10 matches is a big difference \u2013 [the equivalent of] two and a half months without training. \u201cBut this was a wonderful match against very dangerous opponents. Now we need to rest as much as we can. Unfortunately we have to go to the United States [for a \u201cfinal whistle on hate\u201d charity game against New England Revolution in Boston on Wednesday] but, when we come back, we\u2019ll have 10 days to prepare for the final and to recover energy.\u201d The Italian, notoriously superstitious, had refused to go on to the pitch to join his players in a huddle before extra time, and turned away from the last few penalties as Arrizabalaga saved from Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia and Hazard, with what may prove to be his last touch of a football at Stamford Bridge, scored the winner. \u201cI don\u2019t want to enter on the pitch,\u201d explained Sarri. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need to talk to them. I spoke with [the assistant first-team coach, Gianfranco] Zola so they knew very well what to do. And, with the penalties, I didn\u2019t want to suffer so I don\u2019t know whether Kepa saved well or not. \u201cWe played the first final against Manchester City and lost. So now we want to win. In our opinion, our group deserves to win. We were in trouble three months ago and, here in England, if you\u2019re in trouble the level of opponents is very high and it\u2019s not easy to overcome difficulties. We were able to do it. So now we deserve to win a trophy.\u201d Hazard said: \u201cAgainst Arsenal, we\u2019ve struggled a bit the last two or three years. \u201cSo we need to go to Baku with quality to win the game. I always take my responsibility when I have to and, today, I scored and we won. I am happy, the boys are happy, the fans are happy. But it\u2019s not finished.\u201d He then told BT Sport: \u201cI am only thinking to win something for this club. If it\u2019s my last game I will try to do everything. If it\u2019s not, we\u2019ll see. In my mind I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Chelsea and Arsenal, meanwhile, have each been allocated just 6,000 tickets for the final at the 68,700 Olympic Stadium in Baku."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
