It could be a goal, or a miss, or a referee's decision - a moment that defines everything and the arguing ends. Jose Mourinho will contest that that time has still to come. For most observers, however, the defining moment arrived on a crisp spring day when the ball fell to John O'Shea, a boyhood Liverpool fan standing in front of the Kop, with the electronic scoreboard showing that normal time was up. O'Shea, a second-half replacement for the injured Wayne Rooney, was an unlikely hero and he was sporting a boyish smile as he contemplated the implications at the top of the league. \"That must have been soul-destroying for Chelsea,\" he suggested. \"We've been in that position before and it really is soul-destroying. With a couple of minutes to go they [Chelsea] must have been watching the game thinking we were going to drop two points, maybe even three. They were probably thinking Liverpool could nick one because we were down to 10 men and only just holding on. Then we go down the other end and score the winner.\" A lot of the debate since O'Shea's potentially title-winning goal has centred on how much luck United are getting. Sir Alex Ferguson, in a rare moment of magnanimity towards Liverpool, admitted himself that Rafael Ben\u00edtez's team were \"unlucky\" and Mourinho, who clearly has no intentions of following the United manager's advice to \"button his lip\", could not resist questioning the leaders' good fortune. The alternative argument is that United have shown the kind of attributes that are essential for a team with realistic aspirations of finishing as champions: defensive resilience, in Saturday's case inspired by Rio Ferdinand, a thou-shall-not-pass mentality epitomised by the largely unsung Edwin van der Sar and the ability to conjure up late and decisive moments. These are the exact qualities that have established Chelsea as the hegemonic force of English football in the previous two seasons. \"It's been fairly rough over the last couple of games,\" said O'Shea. \"We haven't been as fluent as we can be but we keep winning, don't we? It's a case of digging deep and you have to give us credit for that.\" Digging deep is something Liverpool may have to do when Barcelona come to Anfield tomorrow chasing a 2-1 deficit. \"Everyone is very low but there will be no problem on Tuesday,\" Dirk Kuyt promised. \"We just have to remember how well we played against the side that looks certain to be champions. We are low but we will recover. United have shown throughout the season that they are the best team in the land. People will say they were lucky to beat us but, if you're going to win the championship, you need that bit of luck and it does look like they are going to be champions. As a Liverpool player it hurts to say it but they are virtually there and they deserve it for what they have done over the season. You can't deny they are going to be worthy champions.\" The force is certainly with United and at the very least their supporters are entitled to feel slightly heady when they pencil in the possible dates for the season's climax. Confirming everything at Manchester City on May 5 has a particularly nice ring to it. Ferguson is also acutely aware that the trip to Stamford Bridge will be moved from April 15 to May 8 if either United or Chelsea reach the FA Cup semi-finals, throwing up the possibility that his team will already be champions by the time they head to London. The question is: would Mourinho's players form a guard of honour?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
