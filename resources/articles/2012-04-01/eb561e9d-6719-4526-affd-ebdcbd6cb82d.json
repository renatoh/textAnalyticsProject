Unmarked when equalising 7 Xavi Chipped an early ball in Alexis S\u00e1nchez's direction but by resorting to shots showed how his side were being frustrated 6 Andr\u00e9s Iniesta Starting position in the play was often on the left, from where he pickpocketed Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa and then scored his team's second 7 Alexis S\u00e1nchez Was often involved in the carousel passing in and around the visitors' area \u2013 but was starved of consistent chances 5 Isaac Cuenca A surprise inclusion, operating wide right, and lost possession early on before he supplied ball for Busquets's finish 6 Lionel Messi World's best player crashed a penalty against the bar that would have placed a foot in the final for Bar\u00e7a. Off peak in each leg 5 Substitutes Dani Alves (for Piqu\u00e9, 26); Tello (for Cuenca, 68); Keita (for F\u00e1bregas, 74). Not used Pinto, Thiago, Pedro, Adriano. Chelsea Petr Cech Fine save from Messi on 19 minutes with legs was bettered by spaghetti-legged act to put off Messi for Argentinian's penalty 8/10 Branislav Ivanovic Forced into centre-back following John Terry's and Gary Cahill's departures. Put in a valiant shift and might have scored with header 7 John Terry Only he knows why he kneed S\u00e1nchez in the back for the red card that made sure he will miss the final 3 Gary Cahill Went down early when challenging S\u00e1nchez and pulled hamstring after eight minutes. Bitter disappointment on a big night 5 Ashley Cole Can be proud of defiance once Terry received marching orders. Made one fine break in the opening moments 7 Mikel John Obi Difficult for him to settle into any rhythm but on an evening of stubborn Blues heroics he continued to try to close down space 7 Frank Lampard Lost Busquets for Bar\u00e7a's first goal. As staunch in defence as his colleagues, the veteran produced a class pass to play in Ramires 7 Juan Mata Had to wait 14 minutes for his first touch \u2013 a cross aimed at Drogba from the right \u2013 as the Spaniard had scant chance to show skills 7 Ramires Produced a sand-wedge of a finish over Vald\u00e9s to give Chelsea hope of progressing despite booking that ruled him out of final 8 Raul Meireles Spent his evening helping to pile up the Chelsea barricade by patrolling first line of contact with advancing Bar\u00e7a wave 6 Didier Drogba Gave away penalty and was lucky to see Messi miss but the forward was a vital presence whenever Chelsea broke 6 Substitutes Bosingwa (for Cahill, 12); Kalou (for Mata, 58); Torres (for Drogba, 80). Not used Turnbull, Essien, Malouda, Sturridge. Referee Cuneyt Cakir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
