Four years ago Warnock planned to spend \u00a34m on the midfield player if Sheffield United had not controversially lost their place in the Premier League. And despite Barton's \"baggage\" \u2013 past indiscretions that include a six-month jail sentence for assault and affray \u2013 Warnock has already noticed him trying to help QPR while yet to kick a ball for them. Having also signed Luke Young, the Aston Villa full-back, QPR are now trying to land Shaun Wright-Phillips. A fee has been agreed with Manchester City for the winger and Warnock said: \"I think the big draw for Shaun is going back to London and we have to try to convince him. I think Joey has spoken to him \u2013 they were room-mates when they were at Man City so that might help. \"I want to go everywhere in the Premier League and know that my team has got a chance. To get four or five quality players in an already decent squad \u2013 we know we will have [a chance].\" QPR's cause will be helped by Young and Barton, who Warnock is convinced would have been an England regular and at a top-four club but for his off-field problems. He added: \"I think when he looks back a lot of what's happened, he will regret. But I've said and done a few things and when I look back, it was a bit silly. You have to learn from that. Joey wouldn't be signing for us if he hadn't got some baggage, but I don't worry about that.\" The acquisition of Barton on a free transfer from Newcastle may even prove to be the bargain of the season, according to Paddy Kenny. The QPR goalkeeper said: \"People have to give him a chance. You know what you are going to get from Joey, a 110% every week, and that's what we need.\" Yet keeping Barton out of trouble may prove to be an equally challenging task for Warnock as keeping QPR in the Premier League; that task highlighted by Saturday's disappointing defeat against the perennial strugglers of Wigan. Two goals from Franco Di Santo settled the outcome but Rangers struck the woodwork three times, twice through Adel Taarabt, before Bruno Perone headed against the crossbar. Roberto Mart\u00ednez, the Wigan manager, was relieved, in more ways than one. While Argentinian players have generally flourished at neighbouring clubs, the Spaniard has not been as fortunate. Mauro Boselli arrived for \u00a36m from Estudiantes and returned to them on loan in the summer with a sole Carling Cup goal to his name for the Latics. And Di Santo has been similarly profligate, but mention of his goalscoring record \u2013 now four in three years \u2013 irks Mart\u00ednez. \"I have seen articles that judge him on his scoring records at previous clubs and I think that is unfair. We know the potential Franco has,\" he said. \"He has good decision-making, he knows when to bring players into the game, when to use his strength, when to take people on \u2013 his decisions were really mature [against QPR]. Now it's about being consistent.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
