And that's just the stuff backstage", "bodyText": "\u2022 A strange notion that a festival sponsored by the Telegraph might hold out its hand to liberals and set its face against writers perceived to be too conservative. But the shunning of David Goodhart, author of the immigration blockbuster The British Dream, has led cynics to worry that something is afoot. \"The book isn't very good,\" said Peter Florence, co-founder and director of Hay. But those who fret will worry further on learning that Peter Hitchens, the Mail on Sunday columnist, author and scourge of liberals everywhere, also had his hopes of appearing dashed. \"I was given in January to understand that I would be asked to talk about my book on drugs,\" he tells us. \"A few weeks later I was told that I would not be wanted after all, because there had been a drugs debate the year before. I would have thought they would have known that in January. It's a shame, and it would have been interesting.\" Florence says there's no trend. \"I like him a lot, and would have loved to have done it because he's always been great value on the three occasions he's spoken \u2013 but we'd done that debate the previous year and didn't want to repeat ourselves so soon.\" Hitchens will rise again. Goodhart, who knows? \"David Goodhart can invite who he likes to his own events,\" an observer said. \u2022 As fresh polls predict unprecedented election success for Ukip in next year's European elections, observers compare the two views on offer. There's Nigel Farage, all sun and bonhomie. And then there's Professor Alan Sked, who founded the party and now says it has \"gone completely fruitcake\". Those closer to Sked will no doubt point to events in East Riding, where offensive tweets have appeared on an account owned by Robin Cook, Ukip's local treasurer and prospective parliamentary candidate. Stuff like, on Abu Qatada: \"Of course give him fair trial, just ensure the witness box has 50,000 volts attached.\" And \"why not send him into a tunnel, make sure he doesn't come out of it. Worked with Diana\". A bit unstatesmanlike, we told him. Not me, he said firmly. We have been having trouble with that account. I am not the only one with access to it. On the days in question, he tells us, he was in London with no link to the internet. Still, it's the sort of shambles that would make a critic like Prof Sked, writing today on Comment is free, look away. \u2022 Meanwhile, as Chris Grayling seeks to strip \u00a3220m from the legal aid budget, legal types consider what a boon this could be for Whitehall's favourite private contractor G4S, which may offer cut-price legal representation. For then a suspect could be identified by a G4S investigator, represented by a G4S lawyer and taken in by G4S van to repent in a prison run by the company. All bases covered, for a pretty penny. Happy days. \u2022 The item about the new play, Confessions of Gordon Brown, prompts reminiscence from our friend, writer - and politico Richard Heller. He has also mined the theatrical seam that is the former premier. \"In 2005, the Diary reported my intention to write a play called Waiting for Gordo, a bleak existential drama of backbench life in the Labour party,\" he writes. \"Radio 4's Today programme picked up the story and commissioned me to write it, with help from listeners' contributions, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Beckett's original.\" Beckett's characters became Jim Estragoner and Don Vladimerely, two obscure backbenchers who have nothing to do but pass endless criminal justice bills and await the arrival of Gordo, who will give their lives purpose and importance. \"Nothing happens for two acts, but finally Gordo arrives \u2013 and nothing happens all over again.\" Prescient, wasn't it? \u2022 Finally, as they prepare for that inaugural appearance at Glastonbury, we learn more than we needed to know about the Rolling Stones, and in particular Keith Richards. Sir Mick tells Q Magazine of his limited contact with Margaret Thatcher: \"She struck me as a peculiar politician. She was quite brittle.\" At the same time Keith confesses that he appropriated books from Dartford library. \"I still owe fines from about 50 years ago,\" he says. And then there's a memory from legendary producer Nile Rodgers: \"After reading an interview with Keith Richards, who said he'd given up drugs because it impaired his musical ability, I checked myself into rehab,\" Nile tells ShortList magazine. \"The day I got out, I got a call from Keith asking if I had any coke!\" Ever the wag, that's Keith.
