Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s performance in the British election last night \u2013 and what it could mean for progressives in the US \u2013 is dominating conversations so far at the People\u2019s Summit, which is taking place in Chicago. Bernie Sanders is among those hailing the performance of Corbyn and Labour, who while running on a liberal platform, managed to wipe out the Conservative party\u2019s majority \u2013 in an election some predicted Theresa May\u2019s party would win by a landslide. \u201cAll over the world, people are rising up against austerity and massive levels of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Sanders said on Friday morning. \u201cPeople in the UK, the US and elsewhere want governments that represent all the people, not just the 1%. I congratulate Jeremy Corbyn for running a very effective campaign.\u201d The Guardian is reporting from the summit on Friday and Saturday, and there was a palpable sense that the UK election result seems to have galvanized both the grassroots and progressive politicians up and down the ticket. Maybe it\u2019s just because your Guardian correspondent has an English accent, but people seemed very keen to talk about British politics. Like Sanders, Corbyn has faced criticism from the centre of his party for being on its left, with internal detractors arguing he would be disastrous with voters. Ro Khanna, US congressman for California, told us that Corbyn\u2019s win \u201cshould provide inspiration to Democrats here\u201d. Now it\u2019s the job of progressives, Khanna said, to \u201cmake the case to the Democratic leadership that a positive populist message is not just morally right, it\u2019s strategically smart\u201d. Coming up: the progressives who\u2019ve already won Some of the most hotly anticipated Summit events were featuring progressives who have won office this year. Khalid Kamau, elected to the South Fulton, Georgia, city council in April, and Christine Pellegrino, elected to New York state assembly in May, both ran on progressive platforms. They\u2019re at the People\u2019s Summit to tell activists and elected-officials-to-be how they did it. Kamau campaigned for South Fulton \u2013 just outside Atlanta \u2013 on a platform that included included raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, making voting day a holiday and decriminalizing marijuana. \u201cPeople think that stuff will never work here in Georgia. But if you can get it to work here then you can scale it up to a national level,\u201d he told the Guardian. Both Kamau and Pellegrino were backed by independent organizations such as Our Revolution and People for Bernie. Those groups encouraged activists to make phone calls and canvas on the candidates\u2019 behalf. In Pellegrino\u2019s case the result was remarkable: the former Sanders delegate became the first ever Democrat to represent New York state\u2019s ninth district when she won her special election in May. If you\u2019re at the summit The Guardian has a booth just in front of the main stage. We\u2019ll be working from here or around here on Friday and Saturday so do come say hi. We could talk about Corbyn. Photo of the day Here\u2019s Lord Buckethead, illustrating the less serious side of British politics. He ran against May in her Maidenhead constituency (high-profile members of parliament often attract irreverent opponents \u2013 May was also challenged by a man dressed as Elmo). Buckethead\u2019s longshot candidacy garnered 249 votes, which was not enough to defeat May\u2019s 37,718.
