It is testament to the buzz around the 37-year-old designer that the fashion crowd made the trip far out of their central London comfort zone. Rose is one of the most exciting talents in London menswear. Her label dates back to 2007, but after a hiatus she relaunched it on the catwalk in January. That show was also presented in Tottenham, at Seven Sisters Market. With an 80s take on workwear with silky shirts, Phil Oakley haircuts and tie pins, it was a hit and demonstrated that Rose was one to watch. She also designs for Balenciaga, a highlight of the Paris schedule. This collection continued on the theme of the everyday but moved the focus from work to leisure. The front row seats were made of crash mats, and the moulded climbing wall with colourful grips formed the backdrop. It was appropriate. Models, male and female, wore fleeces, cargo shorts, hoodies and wide jeans \u2013 outdoorsy clothes given a high fashion edge. The workwear that Rose proposed last season was also featured, with striped shirts, wide-legged trousers and blazers. These came in oversized proportions that changed them from banker-wear to something more suited to the kind of creatives in Rose\u2019s milieu. \u201cI started to look at subcultures in Toronto, Portland and Sydney \u2013 couriers and people doing outdoor sports,\u201d Rose said at a preview of the collection. She was open about tapping up territory not usually part of the fashion vocabulary. \u201cI was interested in traditionally uncool things like golf,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the corporate man off duty, like a tech dad.\u201d Of course, a trip to Millets wouldn\u2019t be sufficient here. Rose mixed rambler-wear with rave staples, like cycling shorts and oversized sportswear. This was inspired by the photography of Trevor Hughes, and his pictures of the Toronto cycling and music scene in the 80s and 90s. Rose namechecked Steve Jobs as an inspiration and said that the corporate world she touched on previously remains fertile territory. \u201cThat bled through from last season,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the idea of taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 on his bicycle, wearing rainproof clothing \u2013 featured on the \u201csave the date\u201d for this show. The kind of items usually reserved for biking on a rainy day or for the camping backpack gained an unlikely endorsement on Sunday night but they fit into a wider trend. Identified as \u201cgorpcore\u201d by New York magazine in May, outdoorsy pursuits \u2013 or at least the outdoorsy wardrobe \u2013 is becoming fashionable. Young urbanites are swapping glamour for fleeces, cagoules and hiking boots \u2013 not for practicality but as a fashion statement. Other designers at London men\u2019s fashion week have explored similar territory. Cottweiler\u2019s collection, shown on Saturday, had models toting square water carriers more usually seen on a camp site. With her studio close to the climbing centre, Rose wants to keep things in her community, using a local roti restaurant as caterers. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to the brand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to bring people to Tottenham again.\u201d London men\u2019s fashion week finishes on Monday, with Craig Green and Vivienne Westwood on the schedule. Across the four-day event, a genderless, artistic and anything goes aesthetic has dominated. Designers including Charles Jeffrey, Edward Crutchley and the duo Art School had male models wearing ornate dresses, and there have been performances from dancers on their catwalks. The focus will now shift to Florence, where Off White and JW Anderson will show collections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
