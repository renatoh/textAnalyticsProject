That leaves them no room for manoeuvre if they are to stay in the second band for the 2015 World Cup draw. Slide further into the third band and they will be dropped into a pool with two seeded teams. For a coach, Declan Kidney, who is limping towards the end of his contract in six months, that would make him effectively redundant before Christmas. His injury-ravaged squad may well hang on to their rating and, depending on what happens elsewhere next weekend, it might not be imperative to beat Argentina in Ireland's third and final Test a week on Saturday. But currently they are in a rut of trying very hard and coming up empty-handed. Defeat by the Boks was Ireland's fifth in succession. Yet at half-time they were nine points clear against opponents who were extraordinarily careless in conceding 11 penalties in 40 minutes, from which Jonny Sexton harvested four successful kicks for a 12\u20113 advantage. It was noticeable how quick the Boks were to take the field for the second half, waiting for almost two minutes for Ireland to join them. It was as if they had been only too happy to escape the tongue lashing from their coach, Heyneke Meyer, who admitted as much later. \"There were a few harsh words,\" he said. \"It was unacceptable. You'd like to play a game where you scored lots of tries but this means more than beating Australia at home. \"Speaking to the players at half-time, I said we've always been ahead at half-time in every game this year, even in two away games in Australia and New Zealand, but then we'd lost in the second half. I said this was the worst half I'd seen and told them they have 40 minutes to show us what we can do. The guys responded to that.\" It started courtesy of Ireland's stand-in captain, Jamie Heaslip, getting himself sin-binned for illegally tampering with an advancing Springbok maul. When the shoe had been on the other foot, and JB Pietersen was binned in the first half, Ireland could take no advantage. They conceded 10 points in Heaslip's absence. The Springboks conceded only four penalties after the interval. Ireland, meanwhile, were lost in the contact stuff without their main ball carriers and increasingly were being picked off by the Bok back row in which Francois Louw was particularly effective. And behind him Ruan Pienaar, whose try closed the gap to 12\u201110 to get South Africa motoring, was excellent. There is no better kicker of the ball in world rugby and he pinned Ireland back brilliantly. Nevertheless Tommy Bowe was upbeat about what happens next for Ireland. \"There's a lot of talk about a lot of players being missing but I think the last two weeks have been as intense and impressive period with the Ireland squad than I've ever seen,\" he said. \"I felt going into this game we were going to show that and I think in the first half we did. We played with a bit of accuracy and intensity and unfortunately we let that slip a little in the second half which is something we're going to have to address but I think the mood in the camp would be good coming in on Monday once we get over that. I'm looking forward to the next two games.\" The first of those is against Fiji on Saturday, a non-capped game in which Kidney will draft in a few new faces, out of choice rather than obligation. Then it will be all hands to the pump for the Pumas. With two wins from their last 10 games and only one try scored in the last three, Ireland are not looking too hot.
