Once upon a time the old Cassidy \u2013 the one who was a night owl, unwinding late in restaurants and bars \u2013 might still have been \u201ca little hoarse\u201d or else planning to doze off in the makeup chair. Instead, the new Cassidy, who hosts the ABC\u2019s popular political program Insiders, is quiet and focused. He jots down a few notes, clears his throat. Familiar dark eyebrows crease together under loose silver hair. Cassidy has been a morning person for the past 14 years now \u2013 as long as Insiders has been running. He\u2019s earned his own Barrie Cassidy Appreciation Society, albeit of uncertain membership. Ratings for the Sunday talkshow, featuring a big political interview and a panel of journalists (and a regular segment from Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer Mike Bowers), are up 30% in two years. And over the past six months, it has has surged ahead of both Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise and Channel Nine\u2019s Today to become Australia\u2019s most watched morning program. \u201cSeeing as it\u2019s been the better part of the year, I guess we can finally boast about it,\u201d Cassidy says. \u201cWe\u2019re now the top ranked morning show any day of the week.\u201d In the wooden booth of the Korean restaurant he\u2019s \u201cbeen meaning to try\u201d, Cassidy explains this is his day off. At 65, he golfs \u201cbadly\u201d, jogs a regular path along the Yarra and works his way through some of Melbourne\u2019s better restaurants. \u201cIn a job like this, you never really switch off.\u201d Cassidy has been on our screens for the better part of half a century, as a newsreader, a foreign correspondent in Washington and Brussels, the host of shows from The 7.30 Report to Offsiders. He was press secretary to Bob Hawke, and has been variously accused of \u201closing the plot\u201d by Malcolm Turnbull and of \u201cdeclaring war\u201d on Kevin Rudd but insists he is a friend to neither party \u2013 and gets along just fine with them both. He has a great shaking laugh, the kind that catches you up under his arm. According to outgoing ABC news director Kate Torney, Cassidy is \u201ctoo humble\u201d. She is surprised to hear he has even agreed to be profiled. \u201cWhen he offered me the job as executive producer on Insiders, I was really surprised he knew who the hell I was, to be honest,\u201d Torney says. \u201cI was just in awe of him in those days but also a little scared of him because he\u2019s a man of very few words.\u201d That seemed to serve him well enough on the morning of the show\u2019s very first episode in July 2001 \u2013 when the then prime minister John Howard appeared as the guest. It was also the weekend the Wallabies won a test match against the British and Irish Lions and, from the stands, Howard had screamed himself hoarse. Less than an hour to airtime, he could barely speak. \u201cHe thought about pulling out,\u201d Cassidy says. \u201cBut he was good company. At least I\u2019m not the only one who suffers from getting carried away at football matches.\u201d Another brand of football has made its mark on the program too. \u201cThey tell me my performance will sometimes be affected by Collingwood\u2019s performance,\u201d he says. That has included two separate grand final defeats. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word before going to air and I was wondering whether he\u2019d say a word on air, to be honest,\u201d Torney says. Worth remembering, too, is that it was the cheek of a football fan that landed Cassidy his first stint reporting in 1962. Twelve years old and thumbing through the weekly four pages of his home town of Chiltern, Cassidy decided the match reports weren\u2019t up to scratch. \u201cThe shire president owned the newspaper and he was a lovely bloke but he wasn\u2019t a great writer,\u201d he says. \u201cEven at 12, I understood that.\u201d Later he moved from his first job at the Border Morning Mail in Albury to Shepparton News so he could play football on the weekends. However, it would be many years and many jobs in between, including court reporting for the Melbourne Herald, before Cassidy became truly excited about journalism. The feeling stole up on him suddenly, on his first day as a press gallery reporter in Melbourne\u2019s Old Parliament House. \u201cAlmost instantly, for the first time really as a journalist, I loved what I was doing,\u201d Cassidy says. \u201cI had no background at all in politics growing up, but I loved the debate. I could sit there all day listening.\u201d For the next year, Cassidy spent his evenings at night school, taking any class even vaguely related to politics to find out \u201cwho was prime minister before Menzies\u201d. In Melbourne, Cassidy recalls, the day began at 10.30am in premier Dick Hamer\u2019s office, with a cup of tea and the rest of the press gallery. \u201cHamer would sit on his desk and chat to us about whatever we wanted and then at the end he\u2019d say \u2018get your tape recorders out and we\u2019ll put it on the record,\u2019\u201d Cassidy says. \u201cIt was such a quaint, old-fashioned way of handling the media \u2013 it was almost neighbourly.\u201d Cassidy moved to the ABC, covering first state and then federal politics.In 1986, Hawke offered him the job of press secretary. \u201cI remember he was 10 points behind in the polls and people said I was crazy,\u201d Cassidy says. \u201cBut I thought if I was ever going to see politics from the inside, then this would be the guy to do it with. And even though he was a lout and a larrikin and a drunk, I still admired him.\u201d That Cassidy was himself something of a blank slate in political terms, not driven by any ideology or faction, made him particularly helpful to Hawke. After a rocky first day (in which an unsuspecting Cassidy threw Hawke\u2019s carefully marked up horseracing form guide in the bin), the prime minister came to rely on \u201cButch Cassidy his press bloke\u201d more and more. It was a job that took Cassidy to more than 30 different countries, to intimate dinners at the White House and talks that changed history. Also along for the ride at the time was adviser and later Labor minister Craig Emerson. \u201cWhen I met Barrie, I thought he was really famous: Barrie Cassidy from the ABC,\u201d Emerson says. Over their four years working for Hawke, the pair formed a close \u201cand entirely deniable\u201d friendship. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great sense of humour,\u201d Emerson says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s very experienced in analysing bullshit from politicians. Barrie can do that better than anyone.\u201d He can also smell political survival better than most, which is why when Paul Keating challenged Hawke in June 1991, Cassidy knew it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before Keating succeeded him. But he quickly realised Hawke couldn\u2019t be persuaded to bow out. \u201cHe said to me \u2018I think you\u2019re a bit tired\u2019 and I said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 and left,\u201d Cassidy says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m introduced at functions, people always say that I left when Hawke left, but actually I left between the two challenges.\u201d It was then, after an approach by the \u201cmost senior numbers man\u201d in the Labor party, that Cassidy\u2019s own career could have swung into politics. \u201cI said there was only one seat I\u2019d ever take \u2013 the seat where I grew up, because you\u2019d need to have an emotional attachment to that seat to really tolerate the things politicians do,\u201d Cassidy says. Instead, he chose to return to journalism \u2013 to the Australian newspaper, then back to television. But, those four years in Hawke\u2019s camp left their mark. Accusations of Labor bias have followed Cassidy ever since. In 2013, the day after the September election was called and in one of his last acts as arts minister, Labor\u2019s Tony Burke appointed Cassidy as chairman of the Old Parliament House advisory council. The move was quickly branded \u201cpolitical favour\u201d by opponents, with both the new prime minister, Tony Abbott, and the attorney general, George Brandis, calling for Cassidy\u2019s resignation. Abbott accused Labor of rushing \u201cto appoint its friends to all sorts of positions in the dying days\u201d. In the end, Cassidy gave in, resigning from the position to avoid \u201cshrouding the board in controversy\u201d. \u201cIt was a pain in the arse, actually,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was never a member of the Labor party but you build up lifetime relationships with people. That\u2019s never stopped me getting on well with Coalition MPs too. I think they understand that I do my job and they do theirs.\u201d In 2014, Cassidy took three months off to write his family memoir Private Bill, travelling through the old war zones of Europe in the footsteps of his father, who had been taken prisoner during the second word war. The time off could well have been a permanent decision, Cassidy says, but he missed the \u201cengagement\u201d too much. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to walk away from it all. People have said in the past that I\u2019ve been a mentor to them but in the last few years, because of the changing nature of journalism, I\u2019ve seen that reversed and now young people are mentors to me.\u201d He stops to skewer another dumpling and check his phone. In the spirit of the new digital era, he\u2019s just celebrated his third month on Twitter. \u201cIt took me a long time to get on, I thought it\u2019d be too negative or too time-consuming,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be irrelevant. I don\u2019t know how long the ABC wants me to do Insiders and maybe my career is coming to an end. Twitter is about survival.\u201d Something beeps under Cassidy\u2019s finger and, with one deft tap, falls silent. He reads it and chuckles. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to remain relevant, I better start now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
