This result will reinforce the view in some parts that the first cracks are starting to appear in Forest's promotion challenge as Freddy Eastwood condemned Billy Davies's side to their second defeat in three matches on a night that ended with Amy Fearn refereeing. Fearn, who was strongly criticised by Mike Newell when she ran the line at a Luton Town match in 2006, replaced Tony Bates in the 71st minute after the referee limped off injured. There were the predictable cheers when she awarded her first free-kick, in Coventry's favour, but her time in the middle passed by without major incident as Forest's threat petered out and Chris Coleman's team held on to secure victory. Davies, who has expressed his frustration at the board's failure to bring in any signings in January despite submitting a list of targets he hoped would help sustain Forest's charge, was entitled to claim that his side did not deserve to lose but the lack of a cutting edge to complement the neat, incisive passing in midfield was glaring. \"I have seen us have better final third opportunities,\" the Forest manager said. Indeed Forest's best chance arrived as early as the sixth minute, when Paul McKenna's quickly taken free-kick released the recalled Joe Garner only for Keiren Westwood to block his low drive. Coventry had been pegged back for almost the entire opening half-hour but a rare attack during that period produced the only goal when Eastwood prodded home from close range after Lee Camp could only parry Richard Wood's effort. Defeat leaves Forest in third place, four points behind West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United, and, as Davies was quick to point out, far higher than anyone at the City Ground would have imagined the team would be at the start of the season. \"We have put ourselves in a wonderful position with 16 games to go,\" he said. \"The players should be very proud with where they are.\" And what about the referee? \"I was happy with the second one,\" said Coleman, smiling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
