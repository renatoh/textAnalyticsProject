Racing into the channels, Ronaldo was the difference last night, his pace a constant concern for Arsenal's centre-backs, who lacked cover in the full-back positions. The match was fairly equal in terms of possession but the contrast between the two main strikers was considerable. While Ronaldo tore between Johan Djourou and Kolo Tour\u00e9, Emmanuel Adebayor battled vainly against Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. Ronaldo occasionally risked the assistant referee's flag but he never stopped stretching Arsenal's back line. With Dimitar Berbatov and Carlos Tevez on the sidelines, United began with a three-prong attack that saw Park Ji-sung and Wayne Rooney working the flanks and the free-spirit Ronaldo darting into the space between and beyond Arsenal's centre-backs. Sir Alex Ferguson used Ronaldo in this role in Porto last month and he clearly relishes the opportunity to play centrally. He might even have a greater influence in this position as opposed to out wide where he relies on the service of others. All the same, no one could have envisaged such a dramatic start, Park smuggling the ball past Manuel Almunia when Kieran Gibbs slipped after Ronaldo broke on the left. Three minutes later Ronaldo added a second with a free-kick blockbuster which many may unfairly blame on Almunia. Arsenal must have been tempted to open up the midfield and place Robin van Persie alongside Adebayor but there were 80 minutes left: an awful conundrum for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. It was not until the half-hour mark that Samir Nasri was switched to the left and Van Persie joined Adebayor. Arsenal, however, were unable to find their rhythm, their build-up play floundering against United's quickly retreating five-man midfield. There was not even a decent effort on Edwin van der Sar's goal in the opening half. After United's magnificent third goal, Ferguson was able to relieve Anderson, Patrice Evra and Rooney of their duties. Darren Fletcher, tracking Cesc F\u00e1bregas, was unlucky to be dismissed; Van Persie the recipient of a fortuitous penalty. All that was left was for a dispirited Arsenal side to monopolise the ball as United sat deep and the game fizzled out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
