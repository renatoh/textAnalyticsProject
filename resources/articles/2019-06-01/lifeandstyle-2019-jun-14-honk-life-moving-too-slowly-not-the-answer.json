That\u2019s not the answer", "bodyText": "You needn\u2019t spend long in a city where the honking of car horns is out of control \u2013 New York or Delhi, say \u2013 before you notice something: in practical terms, almost every honk is pointless. Every driver is stuck in the same traffic, with the same desire to make progress and the same inability to do so. Surely no honker believes their honk will make the critical difference and get things moving; honking simply provides drivers with brief cathartic relief from their fury that things aren\u2019t moving faster. This is the modern epidemic of impatience in a pure form. You want reality to be one way, but it stubbornly insists on being the other way, so you make a loud noise to express your anger \u2013 thereby ensuring everyone in earshot is annoyed, so at least you don\u2019t have to feel so alone. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the publication of Faster: The Acceleration Of Just About Everything, by the science writer James Gleick, which first introduced me to a truth that has grown truer in the decades since: the faster life moves, the worse impatience gets. Rationally, it shouldn\u2019t be that way. In a world of dishwashers and jet engines, time ought to feel more expansive, thanks to all the hours freed up for more meaningful matters. But, of course, that\u2019s not how it feels. Instead, we grow more agitated with even the smallest delay. As the speed with which we feel our desires ought to be gratified tends toward zero, every wait becomes an affront. If you knew a journey would take for ever \u2013 because you were a medieval cattle drover or a passenger on a 19th-century transatlantic steamship, maybe \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t mind so much. It\u2019s because cars can move so fast that it\u2019s annoying when they don\u2019t. Rereading Gleick today is unsettling because he was writing before smartphones and broadband became ubiquitous, and the trends he identifies have since reached warp speed. Online, it\u2019s easy to feel independent from the constraints of reality \u2013 as if you could be anyone, know everything and visit any location on the planet, all instantaneously. So every time you realise you aren\u2019t, it feels worse. The problem isn\u2019t limited to impatience. The rage that\u2019s often unleashed on social media towards dissenting opinions betrays the same indignation: how dare anyone challenge my power to lay down the law? We live as if we are just on the verge of becoming gods, but never quite get there. No wonder we take it badly when reminded we never will. All this helps explain the true appeal of what is misleadingly called the \u201cslow movement\u201d \u2013 typified by those \u201cslow TV\u201d programmes featuring the whole journey of the 830 Dalesman bus trundling across North Yorkshire, or the seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo. Why do we call these \u201cslow\u201d? The Dalesman doesn\u2019t dawdle, and Norwegian trains move fast. We\u2019re responding to something deeper than slowness: the idea of letting things take the time they take. This is what I\u2019m forgetting when I get antsy waiting for a toddler who is intently studying the hinges of a neighbour\u2019s front gate: not that \u201cslow is better\u201d, but that reality has its own speed \u2013 sometimes slow, sometimes fast \u2013 and railing against the facts is a foolish and self-defeating way to use up your life. Re-read this In 1999\u2019s Faster, James Gleick examines the near-universal illness of \u201churry sickness\u201d, and how our increasingly efficient society makes us prone to greater impatience and boredom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
