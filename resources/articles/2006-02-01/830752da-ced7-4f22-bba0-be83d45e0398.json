Mr Greenspan's official title would be \"honorary adviser\" to the chancellor and his task would be to offer his services on \"issues relating to global economic change\", the Treasury said. Mr Greenspan's new role will involve regular meetings with Mr Brown, but the advice will come for free. \"Dr Greenspan has declined any direct remuneration,\" the Treasury said. Mr Brown, a big fan of the former Fed chairman, said: \"I am delighted that Dr Greenspan has agreed to be honorary adviser. His advice on issues relating to global economic change will be much appreciated.\" In December, the chancellor hosted a special meeting of the G7 finance ministers and central bankers in London to pay tribute to Mr Greenspan whom he described as \"the rock of stability upon which today's global economy is built\". The admiration seems to run both ways. Mr Greenspan has described Mr Brown as being \"without peer amongst the world's economic policy-makers\". The Treasury last week announced a series of global economic forums with world leaders on a number of issues: financial services, digital electronics, science, education, health care and modern manufacturing. Mr Greenspan has acquired legendary status during his time at the US central bank, especially for his cool head in several crises from the 1987 stock market crash to the September 11 attacks on the US. His final act in charge of the Fed was to raise US interest rates to 4.5% yesterday before handing over to Ben Bernanke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
