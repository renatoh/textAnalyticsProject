That will end our live coverage. To summarize: A Nevada parole board has voted unanimously to allow OJ Simpson to go free as early as October, citing the former NFL star\u2019s compliance with prison rules, his lack of prior convictions, his low risk of committing another crime, his community support and stable post-release plans. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to read Amanda Holpuch\u2019s full report on today\u2019s hearing below. Simpson\u2019s attorney said he never believed parole was a sure thing: \u201cIt was hard to know the certainty of this,\u201d LaVergne says. \u201cMr Simpson is obviously a very polarizing figure. He\u2019s very well loved, but he\u2019s also held into contempt by a lot of people.\u201d LaVergne now berating a reporter who\u2019s brought up retired correctional officer Jeffrey Felix who worked at Lovelock and talked about Simpson. The attorney says he\u2019s started the process of getting Felix\u2019s pension stipped. Interestingly, when Simpson was sitting in front of a hot mic in the moments before the parole board\u2019s decision was announced, the microphone overheard him saying he might sue Felix. It\u2019s official: Inmate No. 1027820 at Lovelock correctional facility will be released in October. Now Simpson\u2019s attorney Malcolm LaVergne is fielding questions from media. LaVergne says Fremong\u2019s testimony in favor of Simpson was very helpful in helping broker Simpson\u2019s release. Right now Fremong is sitting with Simpson and his family inside the facility, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re friends,\u201d LaVergne says. \u201cThis was a big mishap.\u201d Now the parole board is back in the room, saving OJ from the hot mic (and himself). Tony Corda is speaking. He says Simpson deserved to go to prison for his crime, but he\u2019s complied with the rules of the prison, he\u2019s a low risk to reoffend, he has community support and stable post-release plans. The question is whether he\u2019s served enough time in prison on this case. Corda agrees he has. Jackson and Endel also concur. And finally Bisbee votes to grant parole, completing the unanimous 4-0 decision. \u201cThank you!\u201d Simpson says as applause rings in the room. OJ now talking about cookies and ice cream. And now Mike Tyson. Not a joke. OJ Simpson and his attorney Malcolm LaVergne are back in the teleconference room at Lovelock correctional center. Now Simpson is smiling and laughing with others in the room on a hot mic (!), talking about the challenges of the teleconference format. If there was any surprise to today\u2019s routine hearing, it was Simpson\u2019s semi-confrontational posture to the board, specifically the self-justification of the robbery in his opening remarks. That said, every testimony was in his favor and by all accounts he\u2019s shown himself to be rehabilitated: a model prisoner. Most seem to agree he\u2019s served more than enough time for the crime he\u2019s been incarcerated for. All signs indicate he will be paroled today and released on or around 1 October, but it\u2019s not as if Simpson\u2019s very American tale hasn\u2019t offered up final-reel twists in the past. Stay tuned. Bisbee calls the hearing into recess so the board can move into deliberations, which could take up to a half hour. The four-member panel must be unanimous to make a decision. If they are divided, the other two commissioners are brought in to add their feedback. From there, it\u2019s subject to a simple majority. A 3-3 deadlock will result in another hearing in six months\u2019 time. Fromong closes: \u201cWe all make mistakes. OJ made his. He\u2019s been here and from what I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s been a model inmate. He\u2019s been an example to others. During the trial I recommended he serve one to three years. That\u2019s what I recommended to the DA. I\u2019m here to say that I\u2019ve known OJ for a long time. I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s a threat to anyone out there. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. I know that he does a lot for other people and I feel that nine-and-a-half-to-33 years was way too long. And I feel that it\u2019s time to give him a second chance. It\u2019s time for him to go home to his family, his friends. This is a good man, he made a mistake.\u201d Now Bruce Fromong is speaking. He says first and forement he\u2019s not only here as Simpson\u2019s friend of almost 27 years, but he\u2019s also appearing as a victim of a crime. He believes Simpson was misguided on the date of the crime, that he was misled about what was going to be there that day. He was promised family photos, family heirlooms, possibly his ex-wife\u2019s engagement ring, when in reality it was mostly football memorabilia. He admits there were items in that room that were stolen from Simpson, but he insists that he never stole anything from OJ. (A point on which Simpson appears to agree.) \u201cI will make this clear to you: OJ never held a gun on me,\u201d Fromong says. \u201cThere was a coward in that room, a man named McClinton, who came up gangster-style. He held the gun on me. Not OJ. Another man came in, hit me. Not OJ, he never laid a hand on me.\u201d Simpson\u2019s attorney\u2019s second point focuses on the amends that Simpson has made with Bruce Fromong, one of the two robbery victims (and the only one still living). Fromong will testify next, but Simpson will make his closing statement first. \u201cI am sorry the things turned out the way they did,\u201d Simpson says in his final statement to the board. \u201cI had no intention to commit a crime.\u201d LaVergne says this letter, which he claims he\u2019s reading without Simpson\u2019s knowledge, proves Simpson\u2019s positive intentions and represents \u201cthe definiton of character\u201d: that Simpson had a friend suddenly in a position of power but he refused to use it to try and get better treatment or an early release. That\u2019s the first part of LaVergne\u2019s closing remarks, he says. Bisbee now tells Simpson\u2019s attorney Malcolm LaVergne that it\u2019s time for closing statements. He reads a letter written by Simpson to Nevada state Assemblyman Osvaldo Fumo, the full text of which appears below. Arnelle Simpson, OJ\u2019s oldest child, is now speaking on his behalf: \u201cNo one really knows how much we\u2019ve been through.\u201d She says the family realizes he\u2019s not perfect but has done the best he can and acknowledges he didn\u2019t make the right decision in 2008 when he tried to take back his property. Indeed, Endel is wearing a Kansas City Chiefs tie. Endel asks how he\u2019d anticipate dealing with public scrutiny if released. Simpson says he\u2019s been recognized publicly \u201csince I was 19\u201d and is more than used to it. He says even in the two decades since his double-murder trial, he rarely encounteres negativity on the streets and has remained as appraochable as ever. Adam Endel, another parole commissioner, asks whether he\u2019s completed his restitution payments to the victims. After a bit of a confusion, Simpson confirms he has. Endel then asks why parole would be better for Simpson than completing his sentence in Lovelock. Simpson says he\u2019s been denied time with his four kids long enough: \u201cI\u2019ve served my time. ... I\u2019ve not complained for nine years. All I\u2019ve done is try to be helpful.\u201d He says he\u2019s received many interview requests and job offers from media and turned them all down. Endel asks if Simpson emphasizes that any violation of his parole, if it\u2019s granted, would result in his returning to prison: \u201cI\u2019ve never lived a criminal life. I\u2019m a pretty straight shooter.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t made any excuses in nine years here,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cBut I should have never let these security guys try to help when they were only trying to help themselves.\u201d Jackson says they\u2019ve received hundreds of letters of support and hundreds of letters against his release. Most of the latter group, Jackson says, have begged the board to consider Simpson\u2019s criminial trial in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and her friend and subsequent civil judgment against Simpson. Jackson confirms what we already knew: the board will not considered either of these factors in their decision. Simpson somewhat meekly shrugs his shoulders in consent. Simpson is asked whether these courses, including a computer course, will help his re-adjustment to the world. \u201cI\u2019m not a guy who has conflicts on the street,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cI\u2019m a guy who\u2019s got along with just about everybody.\u201d Corn asks another question: \u201cWhat do you think the impact was on your victims?\u201d Simpson says he knows what the impact was, but re-emphasizes that no one ever accused him of pulling a weapon on them. Now Susan Jackson, another parole commissioner, asks about his commitment to Christianity and how he started a Baptist ministy in prison. He then tells Jackson about the various courses he\u2019s complete in prison, inclduing courses in Alternative to Violence and Victim Empathy. He admits that he \u201chad a few drinks\u201d on the day of the robbery because they were celebrating a wedding, but he never had a substance abuse issue. Jackson says that she asks the question because he promised the parole board in 2013 that he\u2019d attend Alcoholics Anonymous, which he hasn\u2019t done. Simpson says he never had a problem and believed that his initiative with the Baptist prayer group and role as commissioner of an 18-team softball league compensates for the exprience he\u2019d have had in AA. ... Simpson\u2019s voice raises as he goes deeper into his account: \u201cIt\u2019s been ruled legally by the state of California that the property was mine.\u201d He finds it unfair that he\u2019s in jall for going to retrieve property that courts ultimately found was rightfully his. He says he didn\u2019t realize guns were brandished in the hotel room until after they were back in the car driving back to their hotel. The former NFL star explains he was contacted by a man who offered photographs of the sports memorabilia that OJ immediately recognized as personal belongings, including his mother\u2019s photo album and personal letters. By chance, \u201ca perfect storm\u201d as Simpson called it, they all ended up in Las Vegas at the same time. The people who had the memorabilia were former friends of OJ, he explains, who had actually helped him move the stuff into storage before. He continues to tell how the scheme to retrieve the property unfolded, nothing that\u2019s not already in the public record. He emphasizes that he had no weapon. (Remember: The four other men who accompanied Simpson, including two who testified that they carried guns, accepted plea deals in the heist and received probation.) He continues ... Simpson is asked whether the first time he was arrested was after the age of 24. He admits he was arrested for the first time \u201cwhen I was 46 or 47\u201d. We all know what that was for. Bisbee says he\u2019s had a substance abuse issue and that Simpson is male. Then she says that Simpson is \u201c90 years old\u201d and both rooms erupt in laugher. OJ, of course, is 70. She corrects her error with a smile. He has stable post-release plans and no gang affiliations. Bisbee says these factors make Simpson a low risk, but the violent nature of the offense will force the board consider factors, both aggravating and mitigating. \u201cMr Simpson, you are getting the same hearing that everybody else gets,\u201d Bisbee says, prompting a hint of laughter from Simpson and his attorney, but adds that she will be adding more information than necessary due to the excessive amount of media interest in the case. Bisbee goes into the explaining the detailed risk assessment used by Nevada to determine the prisoner\u2019s likelihood of committing another crime: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty darn predictive is the bottom line here.\u201d Connie Bisbee, one of the four parole commissioners, starts off the hearing at 10:01am local time by calling for Simpson, who will be joined by one of his representatives. And here\u2019s OJ, who, as previous reports have indicated, has indeed lost a considerable amount of weight. He\u2019s wearing his blue prisoner uniform and joined by his attorney. Bisbee says his parole eligibility date is \u201cOctober 1st, 2017\u201d. The four commissioners of the parole board have taken their seat in their Carson City office. No sign of Simpson yet from Lovelock. The hearing should be under way shortly. The board will depend heavily on a points system that considers 11 factors, including criminal history, age and gender, history of alcohol and/or drug abuse, and behavior as an inmate. Most of these are expected to align in Simpson\u2019s favor. Remember: the same four commissioners for todays hearing already granted Simpson parole on the lesser charges of kidnapping, robbery and burglary in a July 2013 hearing. One factor that won\u2019t be considered is Simpson\u2019s trial (and ultimate acquittal) in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. OJ Simpson, a/k/a inmate No1027820, is scheduled to appear before the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners today for a hearing that will determine whether one of America\u2019s most notorious prisoners will be released after serving nine years of a 33-year sentence for convictions related to a 2007 kidnapping and armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel. The hearing is slated to begin at 10pm local time (1pm ET/6pm BST) or just about 25 minutes from now. Here\u2019s a general idea of what to expect: Simpson, who will participate by video conference from about 100 miles away at Lovelock correctional center, will take questions from the six parole board commissioners for 30 to 45 minutes. He must received a majority of votes from the six-member board in order to receive parole. A 3-3 deadlock will result in another hearing in six months\u2019 time. If paroled, Simpson will be released \u201con or after October 1st\u201d, according to David Smith, a spokesman for the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners. The release of Simpson, now 70, would no doubt kick off a renewed media frenzy that\u2019s been suggested in the days leading up to today\u2019s hearing, which will be broadcast live nationally on ESPN. Offshore betting websites, 5Dimes.com and Bovada.lv are both offering odds on whether the disgraced football star will be released. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s at stake with today\u2019s hearing. OJ Simpson, the former NFL star famously acquitted of murder but later jailed for a doomed bid to retrieve sports memorabilia that he said belonged to him, is expected be a free man soon. On Thursday morning, a Nevada state parole board will hold a hearing for Simpson, 70, who is in the ninth year of a 33-year sentence for armed robbery and assault with a weapon. The disgraced gridiron hero, with the help of several other accomplices, broke into a Las Vegas hotel room on 13 September 2007 and held up two memorabilia dealers for collectibles and personal items he claimed were rightfully his. He was found guilty by a jury on all 12 charges and given the maximum sentence. Four members from the Nevada board of parole commissioners will consider parole for Simpson at the board offices in Carson City in a hearing scheduled for 10am PT. Simpson will participate by video conference from about 100 miles away at Lovelock correctional center, the Pershing County prison where he has been incarcerated since December 2008. The same four commissioners already granted Simpson parole on the lesser charges of kidnapping, robbery and burglary in a July 2013 hearing. That ruling left Simpson with four years remaining before reaching the minimum sentence of nine years. The rate of inmates who are granted parole in discretionary hearings held as they approach their minimum sentence is around 82%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
