Samuel Garvin is a T-bird - the name by which all graduates of the Thunderbird Business School in Arizona are known. Thunderbird, named after the airbase it was built on 50 years ago, was ranked No10 in the world and No6 in the United States in the Financial Times' executive education league table. The $60m gift from Mr Garvin and his wife Rita is believed to be the biggest ever received by a business school and in recognition of the gift, the school has been renamed to Thunderbird, The Garvin School of International Management. Mr Garvin is the founder, chairman and chief executive of the billion-dollar business Continental Promotion Group. Garvin first designed the firm's business model while studying at Thunderbird. Mr Garvin said the gift was \"just the beginning\" of his new programme of support to the school. He added: \"Today, the world needs more global business leaders to serve as bridges between cultures, and the Thunderbird degree, with its emphasis on world business, international studies and language, is perhaps the most important, relevant and respected advanced degree a student of world business can possess.\" Some $40m (\u00a321.7m) of the gift will go towards a support a permanent endowment while the other \u00a320m will go towards specific projects. Scholarships for students from the universities the Garvins attended will also be established. Roy A. Herberger, Jr, the president of Thunderbird, said: \"This gift will support our ability to continuously improve operations on four continents while furthering our investments in a world class faculty. \"The Garvins' gift also focuses on the importance of attracting outstanding students through scholarships and a curriculum designed to consistently meet the demands of a global economy. This wonderful act of generosity fuels our commitment to the values that have made Thunderbird the top ranked international management program in the world.\" The British government is keen to build on the American model of graduate endowments, however, they have a long way to go. University Endowments, a research paper from the education charity the Sutton Trust last year reported that that only five UK universities have endowments worth at least \u00a3100m, compared with 207 in America. The average university in the US top 500 has about 15 times the endowment of the average top 100 UK university."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
