And as her representative, Mr Clifford has taken a 20% cut - netting him \u00a3160,000. The News of the World paid Ms Loos \u00a3350,000 for access to the lurid text messages from the England football captain that she has stored on her phone. She received a further \u00a3150,000 from Sky One for her interview with Kay Burley, which brought near record ratings to the channel. And tonight Ms Loos will make her first terrestrial TV appearance, on Channel 4's Richard &amp; Judy at 5pm. A sighting of Mr Clifford emerging from Sun editor Rebekah Wade's office shortly after allegations about his client first appeared in the News of the World points to a deal with that paper too. Although the Sun could not boast an interview with Ms Loos, it was able to call on several \"friends\" of the former PA. Mr Clifford, who has been advising Ms Loos since she first approached him in January, said he had told the former PA she would \"never have to work again\" if she sold her story. In an interview with the London Evening Standard he describes the allegations - dismissed as \"ludicrous\" by the Beckhams - as \"the biggest story of the decade\". He also reveals that Ms Loos is considering becoming a TV presenter. Mr Clifford tells the Standard he has set up a meeting between Ms Loos and his friend Cheryl Barrymore, the showbusiness agent and former wife of TV presenter Michael, to discuss television presenting jobs. He claims that Beckham could have avoided the current media storm, but also insists it has done nothing to harm the footballer's image. \"David Beckham is wealthy and experienced enough to have made sure this never happened,\" says Mr Clifford. \"He should have been aware that if he played around, eventually it would come back and bite him on the bum. But it hasn't done him any harm at all, not even to his sponsorship deals... If anything, it will enhance his image,\" he adds. Ms Loos was initially pilloried in the News of the World's rivals for her allegations, with the Sun coining the term \"sleazy senorita\" to describe her. But her confident interview with Sky News' Kay Burley, screened last Thursday, won round many of her critics and earned her often glowing reviews. Sarah Marbeck, the model who also claims to have had an affair with Beckham, is due to appear on TV in Australia today to give her story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
