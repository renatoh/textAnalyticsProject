Mexico. It's so flexible. We filmed all of The Matador there. It doubled for Budapest, Manila and Denver, Colorado in the snow. We brought in a snow machine and all the ice in Mexico. You could not get a margarita in Mexico City that night. We ended up having snowball fights with the local kids. I never travel without ... A notebook. I tend to like to keep a diary of what's going on and things I see. My top travel tip is ... Always carry Kleenex in your back pocket in case you're in a country that doesn't have toilet paper! I've been to Cuba, certain parts of Mexico and Bosnia recently and found it's good to have something with you! When I'm travelling I always miss ... My wife. Much of my travel for work is alone and I often spend four-five months in a place with a group of new people. Of course, when I'm travelling with my wife, I miss my mistress ... joke! The luxury I can't live without it ... A good shower. My favourite hotel is ... The Camino Real in Mexico City. They have a sister hotel in Oaxaca - the Camino Real Oaxaca - which is built in an old monastery. That's one of the greatest hotels I've ever stayed in. It's beautiful and unique, the rooms are very large and there's a gorgeous pool. And Oaxaca is a beautiful little city. It's the best of Mexico with none of the bad. I know I'll go back to that hotel. I love ... Mexico City. It is a really great city. But it can be a dangerous, polluted and traffic-filled city. It's not everyone's cup of tea - but I happen to love it. I always bring back ... Some intestinal disease. Nothing else. One of the best things about travel is ... Meeting new people. I'm a New Yorker so I don't know the names of my neighbours, but when I'm travelling I really like to meet people and talk to them. You have the freedom of knowing you're never going to see them again so you can have a real, honest conversation. I find a city will instantly become more interesting or wonderful once you've met an inhabitant. The things I hate about travel is ... The process of getting through airports. I don't mind flying, it's the unpleasantness at the airport and the people you deal with there that is the problem. I've just started ... Flying first class. But only when it's somebody else's dime. For the first time in my career, flying first class is actually a contractual obligation of being a director. \u00b7 The Matador, starring Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, is released on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
