He is defending his seat against the SNP in a contest that will define how Scotland rates not just Tony Blair's record but the importance of a general election now that there's a parliament in Edinburgh. O'Neill, 56, is cheerful enough. He's got home around 9pm to eat his supper and catch the climax of the Liverpool game. And then he talks a good game himself about the campaign. As he goes the rounds in his Ochil constituency he finds neither the disenchantment with New Labour of which the chattering classes speak, nor the attitude that Westminster no longer really matters. 'I haven't really experienced the kind of impatience with politics which leads to what you might call positive apathy,' he says. 'People say, \"Well, we think you've been doing quite well\". One man said, \"Well, you're the best of a bad lot\".' If politics is the art of persuading people not to mind their own business, then O'Neill is a gentle master. With his workers he conducts an amiable canvass of schools, factories and shopping centres to plug Labour's achievements and its plea that it needs more time to finish the job. If the evening is fine, he likes to chat to people as they do their gardens. Few object to setting aside spade or lawnmower for five minutes or so. But for all his cheerfulness he knows that Ochil, a triangle of little industrial towns strung between the affluent enclaves of Bridge of Allan in the west and Kinross in the east with a trio of old mining villages in the south, has been deeply penetrated by the nationalists. Under its old name of Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire, it was captured by George Reid for the SNP in that party's surge of 1974. Five years later devolution lay in tatters and O'Neill won it back, though with a majority of less than 1,000. Reid, now a deputy presiding officer in the Scottish Parliament, took him on again in 1997. This time O'Neill had a majority of 4,652. But now the screw seems to be tightening. The SNP controls Clackmannanshire, which accounts for about two-thirds of the electorate. Its candidate is council leader Keith Brown, who enjoys a big local media presence. Ochil is third on the SNP's list of target seats. By contrast O'Neill, like others in Scotland's almost forgotten army at Westminster, has to make himself heard as the Scottish media become increasingly fixated on Holyrood. And he has had to come to terms with the effective end of his own front-bench aspirations. His patron, Neil Kinnock, made him defence spokesman in 1985. His greatest frustration was to be denied his hopes of Cabinet office when Labour failed to win in 1992. With Kinnock went his ministerial career. His 'soft-left revisionism', as an academic commentator described it, made him enemies in the party and he never won election to the Shadow Cabinet. O'Neill admits he was 'a bit cheesed off' when Blair became leader and he was told that 'we need some fresh faces'. Junior posts might be available, it was hinted, but he reflected that these entailed a lot of drudgery, unappealing if they were heading nowhere. Later he rejected the idea of standing for the Scottish Parliament, believing it should have new blood. 'I didn't think the old fart syndrome had a great deal to offer.' Instead he decided to make the most of the option on offer - chairmanship of the Trade and Industry Select Committee, which he took over in 1995. It has kept him busy and fulfilled, with a fairly good media profile. Its major studies have included energy policy, the Dounreay reactor, e-commerce and the car industry. He was lucky, he says. Select committees came into their own as a check on government, partly because the reduced Tory opposition was 'spread so thin'. He got enough exposure in the Scottish press to 'suggest, at least, that I was doing a job of work'. He says: 'It wasn't as if I was on the one hand sulking in my tent or on the other hand excluded - I've tried to give sympathetic criticism of the Government. I'm not there to foul the party nest but at the same time I'm not necessarily slavishly New Labour in every respect.' His own constituency workload, he finds, has not been much reduced since the Scottish Parliament got going. 'People know me, they know I still do surgeries.' And they don't make much of a distinction between MPs and MSPs. 'The concept of reserved powers is an alien one to a lot of my electorate,' he says. He admits that the future reduction in the number of Scottish MPs will cause bloodletting, particularly for Labour, but argues that it will allow those who remain to focus on issues and specialise. Some, he acknowledges, have found it difficult to find useful things to do. Not surprisingly, he is deeply scornful of the SNP's attitude to Westminster. He says: 'They haven't covered themselves with glory, because they've never been there most of the time. When the national minimum wage was going through the House of Commons we had a very long sitting that went right through the night, and no nationalists were there. The party that claims to stand up for Scotland wouldn't even get out of its bed to defend the low-paid.' The SNP has tried to exploit mutterings among some Labour Ministers that Scotland's share of public spending should be cut because it puts English regions at an unfair disadvantage. O'Neill notes that the Prime Minister, in Aberdeen on Monday, ruled out any change. He accepts that the north-east of England in particular gets a raw deal, but agrees it would be injudicious to remove any inequity by slashing public spending in Scotland. 'It would create unnecessary tensions in Scotland for Labour. If we can move towards a sense where there is a duty on government in a far better articulated way than hitherto to help the disadvantaged regions, I don't think Scots would worry unduly about that. 'But the idea of pouring money into the leafy suburbs of the Home Counties in the interests of equality between the regions, well, that's not the way to go. I don't see why other regions should not get what they need, but equally I don't see what we've achieved should be undermined.' One of the most frequently heard criticisms of New Labour, particularly in London, is of its record on public services. Why, I ask, does it persist with public-private partnerships or its plan for a 'Railtrack' on the London Underground? He replies that people 'aren't particularly worried about who does what as long as they don't make massive profits providing a bad service'. To renationalise Railtrack would mean 'throwing money at shareholders who, in the short term at any rate, haven't done badly'. And, he adds, his committee's work has shown that state corporations don't always get best value when they subcontract. He instances the long-delayed building of the Jubilee Line extension. 'Sometimes they've been ripped off, either intentionally or by accident.' What about the stalemate over the Underground? 'I think a lot of us are very impatient with Ken Livingstone,' he says. 'There has been a sense that his self-indulgence has caused untold damage on a number of occasions. There is a bit of showboating by Livingstone.' The troubles of the Tube seem a long way from Alloa, Tillicoultry and the other towns and villages of Ochil. They're too remote from the New Towns to benefit from the hi-tech employment of Silicon Glen. But the service economy has picked up, with jobs in the call centres in Stirling and retailing parks helping to make up for the decline of mining and textiles. There's even a new bridge being built over the Forth at Kincardine to hook the area up with the motorway network. It's getting late and he bids goodnight. He's on the road from 8am until 9pm. He still enjoys it. 'If you're a politician and you don't like election campaigning, you shouldn't really be in the job.' But next Saturday afternoon he will call a short truce and join that other Martin O'Neill at Hampden for the Scottish Cup Final. However, this O'Neill, raised in Edinburgh and still resident there, will be supporting Hibs.
