One of the show\u2019s regular hosts, Anushka Asthana, said the award had been given for work she already regarded as \u201can absolute career highlight because it has given me the chance to work with the best producers that I\u2019ve ever come across \u2013 who have put their heart and soul into launching and growing this podcast \u2013 ever since editor Katharine Viner came up with the idea.\u201d After the virtual ceremony, attended by George the Poet, last year\u2019s winner of the Podcast of the Year award, the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner said: \u201cThis is a fantastic tribute to our brilliant Today In Focus team for making it such an intelligent and essential daily listen, and to the many Guardian journalists who have contributed their expertise and voices to Today In Focus.\u201d Asthana added: \u201cWow, we\u2019re so chuffed with this award. Winning on current affairs is particularly exciting because \u2013 led by the brilliant Nicole Jackson and Phil Maynard, our producers \u2013 my co-presenter Rachel and Axel on sound design, have worked with Guardian journalists to showcase their work in an incredibly creative way while also generating our own original material. It\u2019s great to see the team get that recognition.\u201d Other well-known big winners included the veteran footballer Ian Wright, whose podcast Football Inside Out: Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup 2019 won in the sports category, and children\u2019s author and performer David Walliams, who won in the family category with Marvellous Musical, a podcast aimed at introducing children to classical music. The event also acknowledged the size of the public\u2019s appetite for listening to people discussing sexual behaviour, gender and relationships. Overall winners of podcast of the year title were Poppy Jay, Rubina Pabani and Roya Eslami for their podcast Deep, Down and Desai: Brown Girls Do It Too, which discusses personal and sexual topics. They also won in the best sex and relationships podcast category. Chris and Rosie Ramsey\u2019s equally candid podcast, Shagged. Married. Annoyed, won the listeners\u2019 choice award, which came out on top in a record total ballot of 229,000 public votes, and the Guilty Feminist\u2019s host Deborah Frances-White received the Spotlight Award, in recognition of the wide audience she draws with a series of podcasts that has featured comedians such as Sara Pascoe and Felicity Ward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
