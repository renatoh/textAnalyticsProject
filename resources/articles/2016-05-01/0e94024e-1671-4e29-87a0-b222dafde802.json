The Commons home affairs select committee said that, 17 years on from the official inquiry into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence, the number of black and Asian faces in senior police roles was \u201cpitiful\u201d and \u201cmany police forces seem to have no better grasp of how to increase diversity than they did decades ago\u201d. The MPs\u2019 inquiry report published on Saturday said that radical action was needed to achieve the ambition of the home secretary, Theresa May, to have a police service \u201cthat looks like the people it serves\u201d and reflects the ethnic profile of the communities it serves. The report names the four forces that do not employ a single black or black British officer in their ranks as Cheshire, North Yorkshire, Dyfed-Powys and Durham. It says that \u201cit is very disappointing\u201d to find that 11 forces have no minority ethnic officers above the rank of inspector and that only two police chief officers identify themselves as black or with a minority ethnic background, neither of them chief constables. Keith Vaz, the Commons home affairs select committee chairman, said: \u201cThe lack of black and minority ethnic representation in our police forces is stark and shocking, and no one looking at this picture can believe it promotes effective policing.\u201d \u201cIn order to police by consent in 21st-century Britain, the police service must mirror the communities they represent, in religion, race and ethnicity. If not, they will be unable to deal with the challenges of modern day policing. \u201cIf we compare the figures from 1999 and 2015, representation of the population in our police forces has progressed at a snail\u2019s pace. This was unacceptable in 1999 and it\u2019s totally unacceptable now. It is as if the Macpherson report was never written,\u201d added Vaz. The report said that no police force in England and Wales has a black and minority ethnic representation that matches its local demographics. Even the Metropolitan police, which has 12.4% black and minority ethnic representation, falls far short of the 40% minority ethnic composition of the capital\u2019s population. The MPs heard evidence from the Met police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, that the law should be changed to allow the force to introduce positive discrimination and introduce 50:50 recruitment. But May has opposed such a move, saying it was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and would require a derogation under EU law to make it legal. When a proposal to endorse Hogan-Howe\u2019s positive discrimination approach was considered by the MPs it was voted down by five votes to two. The report acknowledged that there had been a steady increase in the overall proportion of black and minority ethnic officers with 6,979 out of 127,000 police officers in England and Wales on 31 March 2015. This was an increase of 265 compared with 12 months earlier. However, while there has been some increase in black and minority ethnic officers, it is overwhelmingly concentrated in the junior ranks, there are wide variations between forces, and the lack of non-white faces in its senior leadership suggests the police have an unconscious bias. The MPs call for the appointment of a national \u201cdiversity champion\u201d by the home secretary along with urgent steps in each force including coaching and mentoring, diversity training for selection panels, and the establishment of a senior black and minority ethnic leaders\u2019 forum. Supt Manjit Thandi, who leads on diversity for the College of Policing, responding to the report, agreed that not enough was happening but said there were no quick fixes. \u201cWe are tackling this and have already delivered a bespoke evaluation and action plan to all 43 police forces to improve the recruitment, development, progression and retention of BME officers and staff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to expose senior police leaders to the challenges faced by our diverse officers and staff so we are trialling a reverse mentoring programme in pilot forces.\u201d Thandi said there were \u201cno quick fixes\u201d because they wanted to attract more diverse candidates and to develop existing officers and staff into leadership roles and change their culture so that difference and inclusivity were valued."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
