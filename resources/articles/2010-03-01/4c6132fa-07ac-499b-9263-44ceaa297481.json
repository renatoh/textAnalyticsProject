A packed council chamber \u2013 including Lancy the Giraffe, the club's mascot \u2013 heard a number of objections to the Tesco superstore that will be built between the cricket and football grounds to fund the redevelopment, as well as a rival application for another supermarket to be built on a nearby site. But Trafford Council's planning committee approved Lancashire's plans on a majority vote. The decision will now be referred to the Government Office for the North-West, who have 21 days to decide whether it should be sent for a national inquiry. But with the Northwest Development Agency meeting next week to vote on a \u00a37.2m funding package to add to Lancashire's pot, the club are cautiously optimistic that there will be no further delays \u2013 allowing them to submit a bid to stage a Test in the 2013 Ashes series to the England and Wales Cricket Board, which is due in Manchester for a meeting next month. \"We're absolutely delighted,\" said Cumbes, the former Lancashire seamer who deferred his retirement as chief executive to see the five-year redevelopment project through to the end. \"It was always going to be difficult but it means the club can now move forward in terms of continuing with international cricket at Old Trafford. \"It does get referred to Government North-West, but the government likes decisions to be made locally, so we would hope they would endorse what Trafford Council have said. Then we can start to talk to contractors, and getting ourselves set up for starting work at the end of this year or early next year at the latest. \"We've now got a great chance of retaining international cricket in the North-West because it means we can get on with doing what we want to do, and meeting the requirements that the ECB have.\" Matt Colledge, the leader of Trafford Council, said: \"If the committee's decision is supported by Government Office North-West, this is the beginning of exciting times for the Old Trafford area and the borough generally. It is an important milestone for the cricket club and will hopefully enable them to achieve their ambition to bring international Test match cricket back to Old Trafford. \"These developments will bring \u00a316m of additional value into Trafford and create more than 600 jobs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
