Hawthorn may be no strangers to rivalry curses themselves but their Carlton opponents will be more than aware that they haven\u2019t overcome the Hawks since round six, 2005. Shooting for a 10th straight win against the Blues on Friday night, Hawthorn have started to hit their straps over the past month. Though Carlton\u2019s small forwards Eddie Betts and Jeff Garlett have combined for 12 goals in the past three encounters with the Hawks, Carlton have often failed to put up competitive scores in these clashes. When they last overcame the Hawks it was on the back of five goals to Jarrad Waite and he again looms as Carlton\u2019s main hope up forward. The midfield battle will be evenly matched so Carlton must also find alternative avenues to goal. The Blues had plenty of forward entries last week against Essendon but they\u2019re going to have to make them count if they\u2019re to upset the Hawks. By contrast, Hawthorn don\u2019t seem to have a care in the world at the moment. Jeff Kennett is busy disrupting a different club for once and they come out of their break with four consecutive wins behind them and sit in second place on the ladder. All this and Alistair Clarkson still doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re anywhere near reaching their potential. They\u2019ll be looking to start the second half of their season with a bang. 2) Are the Tigers tough enough? Adelaide fans would have been pained by the sight of their spearhead Taylor Walker hobbling around on crutches last week just as much as they were from watching Kurt Tippett waiting in the wings for his new club Sydney. How they could do with either of them roaming the forward fifty against the Tigers, who are fresh from a break. The Crows were toweled up by the reigning premiers last week and Sydney were able to expose their propensity to turn the ball over under pressure. The Swans have an elite midfield, there is no doubt about it, but you\u2019d think Dustin Martin and Trent Cotchin would have been licking their lips as they watched Daniel Hannebery do as he pleased. The Swan gathered 28 possessions in the first half and Adelaide can\u2019t afford to be as lenient on the Tigers\u2019 dynamic midfield duo. Richmond have some issues of their own of course and coach Damien Hardwick would have made his team more than aware that they currently sit last in the league\u2019s tackling tally. It\u2019s a damning statistic for a team with finals aspirations and they\u2019ll need to turn it around fast. Tiger tough? We\u2019ll have to wait and see on that one. It\u2019s the first of five very winnable upcoming games for Richmond. 3) Are you a member of the Jake Carlisle fan club? Is there anything that Jake Carlisle can\u2019t do? Or to be more precise, is there any Jake Carlisle act that won\u2019t be greeted with breathless applause? The kid can seriously play and is well and truly in line for All-Australian selection but the football world is currently an embarrassingly cloying parent and Jake Carlisle is its over-achieving child. Even after being annihilated by Jarrad Waite in the first half of last Friday night\u2019s win against Carlton, Carlisle still managed to find his way at the top of the best players lists. After Tim Watson wrapped up his on-ground interviews with Essendon players following the win, you half-expected to see dressing room footage of him and the Seven crew giving the young star a shoulder rub. Carlisle\u2019s Bombers should be too good for the Suns, who are themselves in the unique position of appearing to be \u2018on a roll\u2019 despite only winning one of their last four games. They are definitely coming but it\u2019s hard to see this being the night they\u2019ll topple a genuine premiership contender away from home. If Carlisle is left in defence he will be leading a miserly brigade who will make it a tough night for the Suns\u2019 forwards. 4) Will we ever get a fixture we\u2019re happy with? The AFL have used byes, they\u2019ve used split rounds and now they have what we should be calling the \u2018staggered splits\u2019. Three consecutive six game rounds may please the broadcasters and keep the league front and centre in the news cycle, but what sort of spectacle does it lead to? I got a perfect score in my footy tipping comp last week but a 6 just isn\u2019t that impressive, is it? Fans are no doubt aware that fixturing an 18-team competition has its difficulties, but next week\u2019s Saturday night blockbuster between Richmond and the Western Bulldogs surely didn\u2019t even look very blockbustery in the lead-up to the season, let alone now. On Sunday the potentially grueling double-header of GWS v Port Adelaide and Collingwood v Bulldogs may t have fans scurrying for the Neighbours repeats on Ten\u2019s digital channels. Is there a better way of satisfying the need for a mid-season break? Maybe. Maybe not. But if you\u2019re being trumped by Harold Bishop and Toadfish Rebecchi, it may be time to at least reassess. At least we can be happy for North Melbourne fans who will be basking in the relief of not having to throw anything at their TVs this weekend. 5) Collingwood v Western Bulldogs So, Bucks and the \u2018Brat Pack\u2019 are apparently at war. We should all be glad that the football world has settled on that title and not \u2018Rat Pack\u2019 because if we\u2019re honest, Johnson, Didak and Shaw will eventually be remembered in the Emilio Estevez/Judd Nelson league rather than that of Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. The body language Heath Shaw showed towards his boss was a natural talking point coming out of the Pies thumping of Melbourne last weekend but then winners are also grinners. The Pies were ruthless at times on Monday and you can\u2019t see them letting up against a struggling Dogs outfit who are staring down the barrel of a fifth straight defeat. Sticking with the underworld analogies, the Pies are looking like Michael Corleone for this clash and the poor Doggies Fredo. You\u2019d think they\u2019re about to be rowed out onto the lake. The Bulldogs have proved incapable of beating top-eight sides over the past two seasons and it\u2019s hard to see that changing against the Pies, whose midfield depth should again prove too strong. Collingwood will also be looking to eradicate their goal-kicking yips which are beginning to look like they will be a genuine issue come September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
