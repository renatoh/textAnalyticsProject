Kazunari Saito was allegedly paid to feed sleeping pills to Sayaka Nishizawa before suffocating her at her apartment in April, local media said. Ms Nishizawa, 21, had contacted her alleged killer days earlier via his mobile phone website, which he had set up to sell sleeping pills to people contemplating suicide. Ms Nishizawa reportedly paid Mr Saito 200,000 yen (\u00a3835) to kill her, imploring him to stay with her until he was certain she was dead. Police initially attributed her death to suicide, but launched a criminal investigation after noticing that her keys and mobile phone were missing. They tracked down Mr Saito after examining Ms Nishizawa's email correspondence. Reports said she had sent a message to Mr Saito's website saying: \"I want to die. How can I die?\" He replied: \"I will give you lots of sleeping pills. I will help you.\" The electrician, 33, allegedly visited her apartment in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, and fed her 20-30 sleeping pills before suffocating her with a plastic bag. Her father found her body four days later. Mr Saito confessed to the killing while being questioned about supplying sleeping pills to visitors to his website, on which he offered to \"do anything\" for money, including murder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
