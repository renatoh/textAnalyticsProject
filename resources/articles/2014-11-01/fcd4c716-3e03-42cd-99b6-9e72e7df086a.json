Police and protesters have made statements that have been challenged, disproven or denied. A long-awaited announcement on whether or not a grand jury has decided Wilson, 28, should be prosecuted by Missouri authorities is expected shortly. The US Justice Department is conducting a parallel investigation and looking into whether federal civil rights charges should be brought against the officer. Protesters generally expect that Wilson will not be indicted. Bob McCulloch, the St Louis County prosecutor overseeing the case, has said that he will ask a judge for permission to release all the evidence from the case if Wilson is not charged. This means that the conclusion of the grand jury process may offer resolutions to some of the mysteries that have loomed over a town anxiously preparing for the possibility of further clashes between police and demonstrators. These are some: 1. Did Wilson know that Brown was a robbery suspect? Issue: Wilson reportedly confirmed to the grand jury during his four-hour testimony that he first stopped Brown and Brown\u2019s friend, Dorian Johnson, on 9 August because they were jaywalking down Canfield Drive. But he apparently said that as the pair walked away, he realised that Brown matched a description for a suspect in a so-called \u201cstrong-arm\u201d robbery at a nearby grocery store minutes earlier, that had been broadcast over police radio. It was this, Wilson reportedly claims, that led him to pull his SUV up to Brown, where a struggle ensued. Why it matters: If Wilson was explicitly trying to apprehend Brown for a robbery, potentially leading to a criminal record, his claim that Brown reacted aggressively and assaulted him could have been more persuasive to jurors. Johnson has always maintained that Wilson was in fact simply infuriated because the friends had disobeyed him by refusing to get out of the road, and returned to grab Brown. The notion that the 18-year-old responded by assaulting Wilson would make less sense in that scenario. A third possibility is that Brown, who was carrying the cigarillos he had stolen, reacted aggressively because he mistakenly thought that Wilson had realised he was wanted for the robbery. What we know: Police have repeatedly contradicted themselves over this. While abruptly releasing a police report on Brown\u2019s robbery at the same time as he disclosed Wilson\u2019s name as the shooter, at a press conference on 15 August, Ferguson\u2019s police chief, Thomas Jackson, seemed to imply that the two incidents were linked. He said Wilson left another call after a description of the robbery suspect \u201cwas given over the radio\u201d, and had then encountered Brown. Yet at a second press conference that day, Jackson said Wilson did not, in fact, know that Brown was a robbery suspect when he made the stop. Asked why, then, had Wilson stopped Brown, Jackson said: \u201cBecause he was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. That was it.\u201d He repeated this in an interview with CNN. However in an interview the same day with the St Louis Post-Dispatch, Jackson said that having first stopped the friends for jaywalking, Wilson then \u201csaw cigars in Brown\u2019s hand and realised he might be the robber\u201d. In a coded police radio call, which Wilson has reportedly told authorities he made after the initial stop of Brown and Johnson, he told colleagues: \u201cPut me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.\u201d This was apparently a request for backup, indicating that he may indeed have realised that Brown was the robbery suspect and therefore called for support. But in the most detailed official police account of the confrontation published so far, no mention was made of the robbery or of Brown being identified as a suspect for it. A set of \u201cpreliminary investigative details\u201d given by a detective to a medical examiner at the scene apparently after an initial debriefing of Wilson, and included in the state autopsy of Brown\u2019s body, simply stated that after Wilson asked the friends to move out of the road, Brown \u201cbecame belligerent towards officer Wilson\u201d and then the struggle ensued. 2. How badly injured was Wilson? Issue: Police and supporters of Wilson have said that the officer suffered significant injuries to his face during the struggle with Brown at the officer\u2019s SUV. Why it matters: Evidence of visible or serious injuries to Wilson\u2019s face could have provided powerful support to the officer\u2019s allegation that Brown was assaulting him at the SUV, rather than the other way around, and that the 18-year-old was ultimately the aggressor in their confrontation. If Wilson had sustained a severe injury during their first struggle, that could also strengthen Wilson\u2019s apparent argument that it was reasonable for him to open fire when Brown turned to face him and, he claims, threatened again to do him physical harm. What we know: Chief Jon Belmar of St Louis County said in the first press conference on the shooting on 10 August that Brown had \u201cassaulted\u201d Wilson at the SUV. Speaking to a KMOV television reporter three days later, Chief Jackson of Ferguson said of Wilson \u2013 then still unnamed \u2013 that the \u201cside of his face was swollen\u201d. At a press conference that day, he added that Wilson had been taken to hospital. Afterwards, rumours continued to swirl about the severity of Wilson\u2019s injuries. On 20 August, Fox News reported that \u201ca source close to the department\u2019s top brass\u201d in Ferguson told them that Wilson \u201csuffered severe facial injuries including a bone fracture near one eye and was nearly beaten unconscious\u201d. The following day, the Washington Post appeared to confirm that Wilson suffered a fractured bone in his eye socket. Even before then, a photograph purported to be of Wilson, showing a man with a horrific eye injury, was shared thousands of times on social media and blogs. It turned out to in fact depict a motocross rider who died in 2011. But on 21 August CNN reported that a source had informed them \u201cunequivocally\u201d that Wilson did not, in fact, suffer a fracture. Police have declined to address the claim directly. Wilson reportedly told investigators that Brown punched and scratched him, leaving \u201cswelling on his face and cuts on his neck.\u201d In surveillance footage from the Ferguson police headquarters later on the day of the shooting, injuries were not clearly visible on Wilson\u2019s face. 3. How far was Brown from Wilson\u2019s SUV when he was shot? Issue: The day after Brown was killed, police gave a fairly clear description of where he died in relation to Wilson\u2019s SUV, where the pair engaged in a struggle. \u201cThe entire scene, from approximately the car door to the shooting, is about 35 feet,\u201d Chief Belmar of St Louis County said at a 10 August press conference, repeating this five minutes later for emphasis. Why it matters: If Brown indeed died only 35ft away from Wilson\u2019s vehicle, the officer\u2019s claim that the 18-year-old promptly turned around after fleeing and threatened to charge back at Wilson would appear feasible. This may support Wilson\u2019s apparent case to the grand jury that it was reasonable to shoot due to a fear that Brown was about to do him harm. What we know: The police\u2019s initial figure became a fixture in thousands of media reports on the shooting. While Wilson remained publicly silent, a purported friend, \u201cJosie\u201d, called in to a popular conservative radio show and reiterated the point. \u201cMichael takes off with his friend. They get to be about 35ft away and Darren, of course, protocol is to pursue,\u201d she told Dana Loesch. \u201cSo he stands up and yells, \u2018Freeze!\u2019 Michael and his friend turn around and Michael starts taunting him.\u201d But Shaun King, an activist and writer, has put together a detailed and convincing case that Brown in fact died much farther away from Wilson\u2019s SUV than police first stated. Using photographs from the shooting scene, satellite imagery of Canfield Drive, and a recording of the apparent distance on a measuring wheel, King estimates that Brown actually ended up 148ft away from Wilson\u2019s vehicle. Police have declined to comment on his findings. If previously unpublished evidence from the scene supports King\u2019s case, the grand jury will likely have been considering a version of events different from the one generally accepted in the media. If Brown was indeed 148ft away, and Wilson had not caught up to him after giving chase, it may have been more difficult for the officer to persuade the grand jurors that Brown posed him a serious physical threat requiring lethal force. 4. Did witnesses dispute that Michael Brown had his hands up? Issue: A series of witnesses, beginning with Brown\u2019s friend Dorian Johnson, told media in the weeks after the shooting that when Brown stopped fleeing and turned to face Wilson, he raised his arms in surrender. Their statements convinced demonstrators that Brown was murdered, and led to the creation of \u201chands up \u2013 don\u2019t shoot!\u201d as the unofficial slogan of the movement protesting over his death. Why it matters: If Brown indeed surrendered to Wilson after fleeing, it would appear difficult for the officer to justify shooting him \u2013 even if jurors were persuaded that Brown was the initial aggressor at the SUV. Wilson\u2019s case would have been undermined if Brown was showing a universal gesture of surrender when he was shot. If, however, this recollection of the incident was challenged by witnesses other than Wilson himself, the grand jurors would have been presented with testimony that would appear to bolster the officer\u2019s explanation. What we know: What the forensic evidence says about this is disputed. Professor Shawn Parcells, a pathologist who worked on a private autopsy for Brown\u2019s family, said that one shot, to the middle of Brown\u2019s right arm, \u201ccould have occurred when he was putting his hands up\u201d. But other pathologists have said that a state autopsy indicates that his hands were not aloft. No witnesses have gone on the record to say decisively that they saw Brown failing to surrender or charging at Wilson. But the Washington Post reported last month that \u201cmore than a half-dozen unnamed black witnesses have provided testimony to a St Louis County grand jury that largely supports Wilson\u2019s account\u201d but \u201cnone have spoken publicly out of fear for their safety\u201d. Such a weight of testimony could have given significant support to Wilson\u2019s case. Adolphus Pruitt, the president of the NAACP\u2019s St Louis branch, has said that the group is offering protection and assistance to witnesses who have testified in the case \u2013 including some who, he said, could later be subject to accusations that they did not \u201ctestify strong enough against the cop\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
