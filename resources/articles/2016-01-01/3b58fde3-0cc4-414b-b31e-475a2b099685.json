Thousands of people took to the streets this weekend for three different protests to call authorities to account. The first was a \u201cflashmob\u201d gathering of women with tambourines and banners with slogans ranging from the flat-out furious to angry black humour. \u201cAll the pepper spray in Cologne has sold out, so how can we feel safe?\u201d asked one. They wanted more respect for women across German society, not just punishment for the perpetrators of the New Year\u2019s Eve attacks. They are furious with police who did little to stop the attacks and then apparently covered up the scale of the problem, and officials whose initial response was to warn women to stay \u201can arm\u2019s length\u201d away from men. \u201cIt makes me so angry, they have enough police to protect banks and politicians, but simple women in the street? Not enough,\u201d said Cornelia Quarta, a housewife who started off with the women\u2019s demonstration and, like many there, went on to join a growing anti-fascist demonstration on the other side of the station, where banners carried messages such as \u201crefugees welcome\u201d. For some of the hundreds who began gathering around midday to confront supporters of anti-immigration group Pegida at a rival rally, the enthusiasm of some parts of German society to heap blame on outsiders brought up unpleasant memories of second world war atrocities. \u201cLook what happened 70 years ago, people haven\u2019t learned,\u201d said supermarket clerk Sebastian Budnik at the anti-fascist rally. \u201cA mass of people, doing stupid things, but believing they are right.\u201d A statement issued by Cologne police on Saturday night said the number of reported cases of violence had risen substantially to 379 \u2013 40% of them involving sexual assault. Police earlier said 31 people had been identified as being involved in the violence, of whom 18 were asylum seekers suspected of crimes ranging from theft to assault. None of the asylum seekers was suspected of committing sexual assaults. Pegida was quick to capitalise on news that there were asylum seekers involved in some attacks and called a demonstration for midday on Saturday. Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson flew in to tell the crowd \u201cIslam is a cancer, and Pegida is a cure\u201d, earning shouts of approval when he urged his listeners \u201cit is our God-given right and duty to protect our women. It\u2019s what men do.\u201d For all the talk of women\u2019s rights in speeches, and banners calling all refugees rapists, there were far more actual women at the rival protest, behind barriers heavily guarded by riot police. \u201cI am upset when I see there are areas in the city you can\u2019t go to as a woman,\u201d said Bettina Sattler, a violinist carrying a banner reading: \u201cAny pack of drunks is unbearable.\u201d She joined the women\u2019s demo, thinking of her daughters, and was at the second rally to protest against rightwing groups hijacking women\u2019s rights to push an anti-immigration agenda. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s simpler to say \u2018they must go\u2019 than to think about a solution,\u201d she said. \u201cGod [gave] them brains \u2013 [but] you can\u2019t force people to think if they don\u2019t want to.\u201d Germany was lauded for its generosity to refugees fleeing from Syria, Iraq and other countries last year, but now seems to be drawing back from that welcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation I absolutely don\u2019t like. I am full of sorrow for Germany,\u201d said administrator Monica Payen. Like others at the anti-fascist demonstration, the 60-year-old worried that politicians had failed to get to grips with the difficulties of absorbing a huge influx of new arrivals in a short period. Franca Santoro, a social worker whose parents were themselves immigrants to Germany, said: \u201cIt\u2019s better to be open about the challenges. It\u2019s not good to \u2018protect\u2019 us, it just makes the racism worse. I thought there would be a lot of racists on the other side, so I came.\u201d Others called for better German lessons, more outreach and a franker discussion of the cultural differences between societies that refugees had left behind and their new home. Anti-immigration groups have been fast to seize on news about the background of the crisis, and Pegida drummed up over 1,000 supporters who travelled from around the region to hear speakers slam chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcome to refugees. \u201cHistory will not forgive Mrs Merkel,\u201d said Robinson, speaking through a translator to a crowd that roared its approval. \u201cHow dare the media imply you are wrong for being here?\u201d Police who were criticised for incompetence in failing to protect women on New Year\u2019s Eve were taking no chances. Helicopters buzzed overhead, water cannon and dozens of riot police were deployed around the streets, separating the protests, channelling demonstrators away from each other and, at one point, using the cannon on Pegida protesters. For a couple of hours, the far-right demonstrators and their opponents faced off, with the anti-fascists shouting slogans like \u201cNazis, no\u201d and \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here.\u201d Nearby, a group of radical teenagers were waving a flag saying \u201cGoodnight White Pride\u201d. \u201cThere are so many Nazis, I\u2019ve come out because I want to stop them,\u201d said one teenager. \u201cIf their side gets bigger, our side needs to.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
