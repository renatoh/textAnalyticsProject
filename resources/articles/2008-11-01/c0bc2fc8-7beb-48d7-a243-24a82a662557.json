To be frank, I wish the place nothing but ill. Its construction has been buggering up the traffic round there for what seems like a decade, I loathe shopping malls on principle, shopping for me being a distress activity only embarked upon when all other avenues have been exhausted, I don't like the fact that they knocked down the old burgundy-tiled Shepherd's Bush station to make way for a shinier replacement, and I am no great fan of what used to be called rampant consumerism. But ... but ... well, for a start the new tube station really is rather neat, large, bright, and airy; and they seem to have eliminated the wind-tunnel effect that used to freeze the marrow and play absolute havoc with one's coiffure as one ascended the escalators. As for the mall itself ... well, I was meeting my daughter there and she was trying to tell me how to get to Top Shop. \"OK, go to the Village ...\" The what? How nauseatingly inappropriate (and reminiscent of the place where Number 6 was imprisoned). A shopping Mall is, in effect, an anti-village; it's a place where no one lives. But, readers, I went to the Village, and it is hard not to be impressed. For a start, it is far larger than many English villages. It is like being in a cathedral where money is worshipped; and it's a cathedral many orders of magnitude larger than the ones where God is worshipped. Such samey blandness as the parade of shops exudes is negated by the sheer scale. It helps if you keep your gaze upwards. \"Wow, dad, it's so modern,\" said my middle child, and he was right: on that day, there was no building more contemporary available for the intimate inspection of the public. Looking up at the tesselated dome was a cross between walking through a giant space greenhouse and the inside of an insect's eyeball. And what a public: the place was heaving. I have walked through the new Grand Arcade in Cambridge, but that was at night and all the shops were shut; I felt as though I was walking through a designer apocalypse. The presence of people would not have improved things much, I thought; and apparently business was not good there right now. But Westfield was the busiest place I have been in since ... well, I can't remember when. The queues for the \"better\" restaurants (Nando's, Pizza Express) looked, at lunchtime, as if they wouldn't be cleared till dinner time. The next day. But it was in the Apple store, where the children were inspecting the company's new phones, that I had an epiphany: this is it. I am now at the epicentre of the modern world. And I don't much like it. I don't need one of these phones; I can't afford one; indeed, I can't afford anything, except some stuff from Waitrose (where we are reminded, in large writing on the walls by the check-out tills, that until 1908, the whole White City area was countryside), in the whole 40-acre, or however the hell big it is, complex. \"I'm going to spend every available free minute I have here,\" said my daughter, not a particularly acquisitive thirteen-year-old, \"until I know my way around with my eyes closed.\" Oh well. Good for her. But for me, I saw the future finally trundling away without me, like a bus that one realises one is too tired, too old, to carry on running after any more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
