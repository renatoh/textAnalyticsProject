Fuck\u201d and \u201cFucking hell\u201d. She also indicated her displeasure on Instagram. Wu initially said fans responding to her tweets were \u201cmaking a lot of assumptions about what I was saying\u201d but on Saturday she said the tweets were indeed related to the news about her show. In her statement, Wu said she had been \u201ctemporarily upset\u201d because the renewal of the sitcom meant she would not be able to pursue another project which would have been more challenging. \u201cI\u2019ve always sought artistic challenge over comfort and ease,\u201d said Wu in a lengthy message posted to Twitter. \u201cI was disappointed in not being able to do that other project \u2013 because that other project would have challenged me as an artist.\u201d In Fresh Off the Boat, Wu plays Jessica, the mother in a Taiwanese American family in Florida in the 1990s. Her star rose considerably in 2018 with the lead role in Crazy Rich Asians, a hit comedy about a New York economics professor who travels to Singapore with her boyfriend and learns he is absurdly wealthy. The role landed a Golden Globe nomination as the film was lauded by critics and audiences alike. Crazy Rich Asians featured an almost entirely Asian cast, which many saw as a challenge to racism in Hollywood. \u201cMy words and ill-timing were insensitive to those who are struggling, especially insensitive considering the fact that I used to be in that struggle too,\u201d Wu said in her statement on Saturday. She added: \u201cIf one does have privilege, they ought to use that privilege the best they can. For me \u2013 that means pushing myself artistically.\u201d She said she hoped fans could understand her disappointment about the loss of another job. \u201cThat conflict is part of being human,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
