Etherington was carried off on a stretcher after he collapsed in agony during Stoke's victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Tuesday, and the club's worst fears were realised when they received the scan results. Tony Pulis, the Stoke manager, has refused to concede that Etherington is definitely out of the final and remains keen to give the 29-year-old, who has been one of the club's most influential players over the past couple of seasons, every opportunity to be fit to face Manchester City at Wembley on 14 May. Yet a torn hamstring can often take up to six weeks to heal, leaving Etherington with insufficient time to recover unless Stoke's medical team can perform a minor miracle. Pulis is determined to cling to the slimmest of chances that the former West Ham player will defy the odds. \"He's had the scan, he's got a torn hamstring and we'll know better in seven days how much chance he's got,\" he said. \"He'll be treated and looked after as best we can. We've got to do our damnedest in the next seven days to put him in a position where we give him the best opportunity to play in the Cup final. His leg could be hanging off and I wouldn't rule him out. \"Matty, the form he's been in, the way he performed in the semi-final as well, was so looking forward to it, as they all are. We were hoping it was a pulled muscle, not torn, but we've got 17 days [from the time of the injury]. He's got a chance. The first week is about making sure the bleeding stops before the mending process starts. So we'll let it rest. He's very disappointed but while he's still got a chance, you keep him going.\" Stoke have had a bad month with injuries. Ricardo Fuller will be out for up to four months after he underwent an operation on his ruptured achilles tendon on Wednesday and Danny Higginbotham will miss the start of next season after suffering cruciate ligament damage. \"Going to Wembley to play Manchester City is hard enough as it is, but to lose three very important players makes it even harder,\" Pulis said. \"But we'll leave no stone unturned [to try to get Etherington fit].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
