The call comes after yet another setback to Sven-Goran Eriksson's forward plans. Already without Liverpool's Michael Owen and with doubts hanging over Wayne Rooney's health, Aston Villa's Darius Vassell had been brought in to provide cover up front with Emile Heskey. But after scoring four goals for his club in a friendly in Dubai yesterday, Vassell has picked up a knee injury that may stop him joining the England squad in Manchester at the weekend. Smith, Leeds' highest scorer with five goals this season, now has the opportunity to pick up his seventh England cap under Eriksson - 13 months after his last."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
