Police and prosecutors are examining evidence from people who contacted officers directly, to determine whether they should press further charges. The NSPCC children's charity was contacted by 13 potential victims, while a law firm specialising in compensation cases said it had heard from a dozen people who alleged Harris, 84, had assaulted them. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) might yet decide not to proceed given the Australian-born entertainer's age, and the likelihood of a significant jail term when he is sentenced on Friday. A spokesman for the law firm Slater and Gordon, which already represents 176 alleged victims of Jimmy Savile, said it would focus on possible civil compensation: \"We would be investigating opportunities to find redress along those lines.\" Harris has an estimated personal fortune of \u00a311m \u2013 a figure uncovered when his trial was shown a 2012 email from his daughter, Bindi, inquiring about the size of the estate and whether she was the beneficiary. He incurred heavy costs during the trial, employing two barristers, the PR firm Bell Pottinger, and a phalanx of private guards. The trial, which resulted in Harris being unanimously convicted on 12 counts on Monday, heard evidence from 10 women. Even before the new potential victims emerged there were seven other complainants whose testimony was not used for legal reasons, and other women who spoke to Australian media during the case. The director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said there was no decision yet on new charges. \"We will work with the police and look at any cases that they send to us to see whether there is enough evidence to bring more charges.\" The trial shredded the reputation of a man with a previously unblemished six-decade reputation as a family entertainer, with immediate repercussions in Britain and Australia. Moves are afoot to strip Harris of his CBE, with a parallel process under way over his Officer of the Order of Australia honour. Harris's hometown of Bassendean in Western Australia plans to remove a plaque in his honour, while his old school, Perth Modern, is to remove his artworks from its walls. The convictions cover assaults by Harris that include the groping of a girl aged about eight who had just sought his autograph, and his indecently touching a 15-year-old girl from an Australian youth theatre group on a tour of London. The latter, Tonya Lee \u2013 who waived her right to anonymity after giving media interviews \u2013 said she was thrilled by the verdicts. \"I am so happy that he was found guilty,\" Lee told Channel Nine. \"It just shows the justice system does work.\" Seven of the convictions relate to a childhood friend of Bindi, who told the court Harris groomed and touched her from the age of 13, continuing intermittent sexual contact for about 15 years. Among the complainants not used in the trial was a BBC television reporter, Letitia Fitzpatrick, who said Harris forcibly kissed her after she interviewed him in 1991.told the Guardian. \"I was in such shock and was just stunned by what had happened.\" The prosecution case rested on the significant similarities between many of the assaults, which the jury was told could hardly be coincidental given all but two of the 10 alleged victims did not know each other. The defence response was to ask the jury whether they could safely convict one of the most prolific and enduring entertainers of modern times purely on the evidence of the complainants. The jury spent more than 36 hours deliberating but were eventually unanimous on all counts. The entertainer will be sentenced following medical reports. The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, warned Harris's defence team that a jail term was \"uppermost in the court's mind\". The evidence of the fourth victim on the counts \u2013 the other six gave evidence as so-called bad character witnesses \u2013 proved arguably crucial. Harris insisted he could not have groped a teenage waitress at a celebrity event in Cambridge in the late 1970s as he had not visited the city until years later. However, mid-trial, a member of the public sent the prosecution video footage of Harris taking part in an ITV show called Star Games filmed in Cambridge in 1978, calling into question his alibi and the credibility of others. The jury was not told that seven more complainants alleged Harris groped or assaulted them, claims covering almost 30 years and involving women and girls aged from 14 upwards. These accounts were given in pretrial hearings, but were not pursued in the main trial for legal reasons. One woman said she was 14 in 1977 when Harris, on a visit to Sydney, grabbed her bottom and pursued her into another room, saying, \"Rolfie deserves a cuddle\". Harris played with the underwear of another witness, a well-known British celebrity, as she recorded a TV interview with him in the mid-1990s. Additionally, new complainants came forward in Australia during the trial, among them a radio host and her male co-presenter. It is a grisly conclusion to Harris's immensely long and hugely successful career, which began when he arrived in London from Perth in 1952, switching from art to cabaret and then children's TV. Over the decades he hosted prime-time entertainment shows, had a series of novelty pop hits and presented cartoon programmes and then animal shows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
