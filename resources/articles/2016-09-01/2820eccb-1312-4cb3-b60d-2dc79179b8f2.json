Pogba played as a quasi-No10 in the Europa League defeat at Feyenoord on Thursday, the first time he has been given a freer remit by Mourinho. Yet, as with the derby defeat at home against Manchester City last Saturday, when Pogba played deeper, the 23-year-old was unable to affect the match. Mourinho is conscious that Pogba is yet to consistently discover his finest form. \u201cThe world-record player is always a question that will be open until somebody breaks the record,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThere are clubs that paid 20, 30, 40 million, which is a bigger deal than United paid for Paul because you make a relation between what you pay and the club revenue and you realise that other clubs paying 20, 30, 40 is a much bigger thing than what United did. \u201cI just want Paul to forget that and to play his football. No pre-season; [after the] Euro final, holidays then come back. It\u2019s normal that in the first week he had the very good impact in the first game. It\u2019s normal that after the first game he has a little decrease. But I am full of trust with him because I know the player he is. I know he is a very good guy with a lot of ambition so the form will come naturally and will come with the team improving. The team improves, he will improve \u2013 no problem.\u201d Asked where he wants Pogba to operate on a regular basis, Mourinho said: \u201cHe can play where he was playing before in the Premier League, where he did against Feyenoord. It\u2019s not a problem with his position \u2013 he feels comfortable in [either]. \u201cIt depends on the situation. In the Premier League we were playing with Wayne Rooney as a No10, and against Feyenoord we played with [Morgan] Schneiderlin in front of the back four and we gave him more freedom to occupy other spaces.\u201d After consecutive defeats Mourinho is intent on winning at Watford on Sunday and is urging his players to find their own drive to do so. \u201cI always say that the best motivation you can have is your own motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an extra source of motivation but the motivation belongs to the player. The great life, the money they have to do what they want, I think they shouldn\u2019t need an extra source of motivation, that belongs to themselves so I believe in that. I believe on Sunday they will try to win the match and give everything and I will be just by them to try to help.\u201d Mourinho brushed off suggestions that the Watford match is now the biggest of United\u2019s campaign. \u201cWatford? I think Man United has to show every game, every game, every competition. \u201cThe club is too big, the supporters are too passionate for the professionals not to feel that every game is a very important game. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think they should need a defeat or in this case two defeats to try to give everything they have to give. It should belong to them and that is what I expect from them \u2013 that on Sunday we will try to win the match normal.\u201d If City defeat Bournemouth on Saturday United will be six points behind them when they kick off. \u201cIt is early days,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI prefer to be four in front than four behind \u2013 that is obvious \u2013 but as you are saying it\u2019s very early days.\u201d He remains intent on progressing in the Europa League despite the opening loss. \u201cI think we have to qualify,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to respect the competition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
