His widow, Helen Newlove, galvanised the reaction by pledging to campaign tirelessly for more community policing, support for families hit by antisocial behaviour and a clampdown on parents of problem youths. Following the brutal killing by a gang of drunken youths last August, there were calls for the government to help crackdown on Britain's drinking culture which often sees underage children drinking openly in public. The chief constable of Cheshire, Peter Fahy, said the legal drinking age should be raised to 21 to combat the \"scourge of antisocial behaviour by young people\". Following the conviction of Newlove's killer, there was also criticism from some quarters that the case highlighted an increasingly fractious society built on the concept of rights to the exclusion of responsibilities. A senior judge said parliament's \"concentration\" on rights had tied the hands of the magistrates who had granted bail to 19-year Adam Swellings in a separate assault case on the day he murdered Newlove. Addressing an offender at Liverpool crown court the day after Newlove's killers were convicted, the judge said: \"It is the fault of politicians that bail is so readily granted, rather than judges or magistrates. \"Parliament and its woeful and indeed dreadful concentration on rights forgets duties and responsibilities. It has meant people like you have the right to bail in these circumstances. \"We are living in a society which is bedevilled by wild feral youths such as you. \"Before we plunge into even greater violence at the hands of lawless and irresponsible youths, it is time for us to address the problem. \"It is time for parents to resume control over their offspring.\" The assistant chief constable of Cheshire police, Garry Shewan, said he believed society saw the Newlove case as a \"tipping point where we all have to take action against anti-social behaviour\". But his comments drew a furious reaction from Times columnist Martin Samuel, who accused the police of not doing their job. \"Not all, Garry. You. Specifically you. You, Garry Shewan, and the officers under your command have to take action against antisocial behaviour because that is your job. We're done. We're finished. They've got us licked. Garry Newlove tried to take action against antisocial behaviour and he was kicked to death outside his home, as his children watched.\" Samuel's article also contained the extraordinary contention, especially from a conservative newspaper, that the police had actually contributed to the death. \"If contributory negligence were more than a common law defence, Cheshire police would be beside Mr Newlove's killers in the dock,\" he said. The Conservative party has sought to ally itself with the Helen Newlove's claims that streets had been taken over by violent youths. \"Passing a new law is not enough. We need a big social, cultural and political change about our whole approach to these issues,\" David Cameron said in the aftermath of the case. He also suggested it was time for \"a return to a form of national service, what I call national citizens' service, something that every 16-year-old should do to learn about their duties and responsibilities as a citizen.\" A YouGov poll carried out for GMTV and the Daily Mirror in the wake of Newlove's death appeared to reflect growing concerns about antisocial behaviour. It showed that half of people felt less safe on the streets than a decade ago and 65% thought under-16s should not be allowed out unsupervised after dark. It was a theme that was picked up by Cameron, who specifically highlighted Newlove's case as he condemned growing \"anarchy in parts of the UK\". The government has accused the Tories of scaremongering about the extent of the problem. Children's secretary Ed Balls said: \"\"When David Cameron talks about anarchy in the UK, when he talks about the breakdown of society, I think he's running down the achievements and the contributions of the vast majority of our young people.\" The London mayor, Ken Livingstone, facing a sustained outbreak of teenage gun and knife crime in the capital, laid the blame at the door of parents who grew up in the 1980s. \"No mayor, no commissioner of police, can stop young people killing each other if they haven't been given a moral code,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
