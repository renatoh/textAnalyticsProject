In London, they can be the size of 10 or 11 buses. Formed when cooking oils and grease harden in cold water and meet with wet wipes and sanitary products, the slimy titans are choking waterways around the world. At the Malabar wastewater treatment plant, wet wipes are a dirty word. The workers call them rags. Unlike toilet paper, a wet wipe does not break down, even after hours rafting through the sewers. They pick up excrement and ball into dark nuggets. Staff spend hours every day hacking them out of pipes and filters. In June, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, backed up by Sydney Water, took Kleenex to court, trying to get the word \u201cflushable\u201d scrubbed off the packaging of their wet wipes. In a decision they are now appealing, they lost. For most, the word fatberg conjures up the image of mammoth, off-white cruiseships of filth made most infamous in the UK. They put one in the Museum of London and called it the \u201cthe Whitechapel Monster\u201d. On a livestream, viewers could watch how it hatched flies, gave off moisture, grew mould and slowly changed colour. In Australia, that still happens, on a lesser scale. \u201cSydney\u2019s network is not as old as London\u2019s,\u201d which inhibits their growth, says Sydney Water\u2019s Peter Hadfield. Here, they come in a range of forms. Out in the wild, a Sydney fatberg can grow up to 1.5m. \u201cOne little nick on the pipe becomes that catch point,\u201d Hadfield says. Five hundred tonnes of fatberg form like this every year. Small, intrepid crews are sent to break them up, costing $8m per annum. More often, the wet wipes sluice through the system in small bundles, all the way to the treatment plants, where it becomes process controller Luke Justus\u2019s problem. At Malabar, Sydney Water collects six dry tonnes every day of wet wipes. In a small subterranean room, the day\u2019s harvest is in a big tub, blackened through its journey, still sticky with oil, smelling foul. In a test conducted by consumer group Choice in 2015, they thrashed wet wipes in an agitator with water. Toilet paper disintegrated within 2 minutes and 40 seconds, reduced to white mush. After 20 hours, the wet wipe looked the same. \u201cIt\u2019s a laminated plastic material, so it\u2019s incredibly tough,\u201d Hadfield says. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t break down at all. \u201cYou can clean a barbecue grill with a wet wipe and it\u2019ll stay,\u201d Justus says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t tear apart. It\u2019s quite difficult to cut. It\u2019s very manual and very intense. Some of the guys have to use hydraulic claws.\u201d Sometimes a big chunk of fatberg dislodges from the sewers and hits the treatment plant\u2019s filter screens. It is like a scene from a Star Trek bridge, all klaxons and warning lights. \u201cSuddenly we have three or four of our screens fail on the master control system,\u201d Justus says. They mobilise a team, with claws and rakes and shovels, to scratch at the wet wipes. The frustration is evident in Justus\u2019s voice. Sarah Agar, the head of policy from Choice, says the ACCC lost its case against Kimberley-Clark over a \u201csemantic\u201d issue. The ACCC argued that \u201cflushable\u201d, in the mind of the ordinary person, means something that breaks down easily and won\u2019t cause blockages. But Justice Jacqueline Gleeson found that there was not enough evidence to suggest that wet wipes alone were the cause of fatbergs and the plumbing problems presented in court. \u201cWe are as equally as baffled as the public at the outcome of this case,\u201d Agar says. \u201cThe judge took a very technical approach to see if specific product had caused blockages. But I don\u2019t think you could find the evidence that any single wipe manufacturer was responsible. \u201cChoice\u2019s view is we should instead be looking at the property of the wipes. We believe \u2018flushable\u2019 means something that will flush like toilet paper and behaves like toilet paper \u2026 I can flush my keys but I wouldn\u2019t label them flushable. \u201cI would hope that on appeal, when the court looks at this again, they take a broader view.\u201d According to Sydney Water, the popularity of wipes comes from a surprising source \u2013 and they blame the actor Will Smith. \u201cWe had made an assumption that it would be young mums, with young families, with babies, who would be the primary user,\u201d Hadfield says. \u201cWe did quite an extensive survey and it was quite interesting, the major user group of flushable wipes were young males, 15-29. \u201cOne of the theories behind that was the rap artist and movie star Will Smith was interviewed and he said to men that they \u2018weren\u2019t really clean\u2019 if they were only using toilet paper, they needed to use wipes.\u201d Smith told the BBC in 2017 that using wet wipes was \u201cspecial and incredible\u201d. \u201cWill Smith, we hate you for what you said,\u201d Hadfield jokes. \u201cBut he was interviewed later and actually apologised because he was concerned he\u2019d caused a real problem with water utilities.\u201d For now, Justus\u2019s life will continue to be plagued by the fatberg menace. He says he wishes that fatbergs were more fat and less wipe. \u201cWhen we think about a fatberg, it\u2019s this image of an iceberg that is made out of fat. That is unfortunately not true \u2013 it\u2019d be easier to manage than what it is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
