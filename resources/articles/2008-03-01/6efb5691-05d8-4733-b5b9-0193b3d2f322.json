Throughout Tuesday and Wednesday in the Belarusian capital, hundreds of men and women of all ages had gathered to light candles and stand silently holding photographs of Irina Kazulina, a tireless campaigner for her husband, Alexander Kozulin, the country's most prominent prisoner. Irina lost her battle against cancer at the weekend, and her funeral took place yesterday. The politics of Belarus have largely fallen off the media map since the presidential election two years ago, when the incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko, who has been called \"Europe's last dictator\", won a third term in an election the OSCE denounced as \"severely flawed\". Since then, one of his chief opponents for the presidency, the 52-year old Kozulin, former rector of the Belarusian State University and leader of the opposition Belarusian Social Democratic party, has been languishing in jail, while his wife Irina and his supporters tried to keep his cause alive. I last met Irina in Minsk in the autumn of 2005, while I was investigating the Belarusian authorities' crackdown on education. She was, as always, her husband's strongest supporter, calmly explaining Belarusian politics with a soft smile and arguing his case when he wasn't around to do so himself. She was also something of a heroine to young Belarusian women: the democracy activist who was with me when I met her was visibly awestruck in her presence. A few months later, Kozulin was arrested and sentenced to five and a half years in prison for his part in organising demonstrations against the election. He remained in jail while his wife's condition worsened. At the weekend, she finally passed away, aged just 48. The Belarusian authorities refused to allow him out to see her during her last days, until finally on Tuesday - after a prolonged hunger strike by Kozulin in prison and much prodding from the US and Europe - he was allowed out to attend her funeral. It may be too soon for optimism over Belarus, and those who have spent time working on human rights in the country may not have much optimism left. Yet Kozulin's release may represent a softening of Belarus's stance towards political prisoners. In recent weeks the government has released six others; Kozulin is the last and most high-profile one still behind bars. If his three-day release becomes permanent, Washington has offered to restart talks between the two countries. Europe, where Belarus remains the only country excluded from the Council of Europe, may also reopen dialogue and eventually lift sanctions. That would be a good start, and there are signs Minsk may welcome it. Lukashenko has softened his rhetoric since claiming, immediately after winning 83% of the vote in 2006, that he had beaten a foreign-backed revolution. Widespread protests gripped the capital, Minsk, after his election victory, and there was much talk that Belarus would be the next ex-Soviet country to have a \"colour revolution\", after Ukraine and Georgia. That did not happen, and while Belarus fell into step with Putin's Russia for some time, the two have recently drifted apart. Last year, the Russian state-run energy company Gazprom threatened to cut off gas supplies to the country unless Belarus agreed to substantially higher prices, taking the country to the brink of losing its only supply. In August last year, Gazprom again threatened to reduce supplies unless Minsk coughed up back payments of $500m (\u00a3250m); it did. Thus Lukashenko's political and economic success - which was built, to a large extent, on cheap Russian energy - may have lost one of its underpinnings, and the president may now consider the benefits of closer EU ties. That, while it may not provide an immediate solution to Belarus's human rights issues, would ultimately be a good thing. It was a sobering sight for many who had gathered outside the Red Church to see Kozulin free. Inside, despite the cameras and photographers, the mood was sombre and respectful. Alexander Kozulin looked composed and well, dressed simply in black and flanked by his two daughters. But he broke down over his wife's coffin. In Irina Kazulina, the opposition - the pro-democracy campaigners, the pro-west camp, whatever one calls them - has lost a powerful ally and symbol. And yet her death could be a turning point for Belarus, not because it is likely to galvanise street protests or an international outcry - such things were tried two years ago and failed - but because it may give Lukashenko an opportunity to thaw relations with the rest of Europe. If Lukashenko takes it, it will be the start of a new road for Belarus - and a great legacy for Irina."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
