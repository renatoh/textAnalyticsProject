Dirty Baby, also Breskin-steered, and also luxuriously packaged as a visual-art object, has a more specific concept \u2013 musical parallels for pop-art pioneer Ed Ruscha's paintings with their gangster-threat titles, richly reproduced in two booklets. Cline is accompanied by a raft of LA musicians here, including producer Jon Brion, and the palette is broadened to include violin, cello, jazz reeds and brass. The first disc's suite-like structure offers acoustic guitar sounds under lazy harmonicas, building to slow funk beats, dirgey, vocal-like melodies, metallic improv, thick Bitches Brew-like textures and ambient hums. The second half comprises 30-odd short, Ruscha-dedicated vignettes, shuffling orchestral elegance and peremptory bangs, fast, jazzy basslines, blues-guitar boogies against what sounds like somebody blowing a post horn, gamelan-percussion swirlings and raw noise. It's less satisfying than Initiate, but Nels Cline has been an uncategorisable innovator for two decades, and certainly remains one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
