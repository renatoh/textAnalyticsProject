That's an incredible amount to be following me when I've only been on Twitter four weeks. And you know what they say? Numbers count.\" Anyone tempted to sneer at Poulter's embrace of twittering celebrity has either never met the 33-year-old or allowed their attention to stray from the world rankings. If numbers do count, as Poulter says, then his rise to 18 in the world provides clear evidence of his resolute self-belief. His second place two months ago at The Players Championship, the mythical \"fifth major\" at the treacherous Sawgrass course, epitomised his good form. That he also finished second at last year's Open, when he was only beaten by some stunning play on the back nine at Birkdale by defending champion Padraig Harrington, has instilled further conviction in Poulter that he can win his first major. But before we can reach that point, the new tweet-master croons over his gathering army of followers. \"Stewart Cink,\" Poulter chortles, as if he can't quite believe the American leads the field, \"has got 400,000 but he registered ages ago. I got half that in a month. Some people don't like it but it's a good thing, surely? If you're sitting in an office, doing nine to five, this is a great insight into pro golf. Where else are you going to see the inside of a players' lounge at a major? Lots of people can't afford to go to major tournaments, so I try and give them a little extra.\" He might tweet some pithy lines, as he did last month when he wrote from a soaking US Open at Bethpage \u2013 \"had sushi last night. Thought it was apt. Going to feel like a fish out there today\" \u2013 but Poulter has entertained his fans as much with his atrocious spelling. He blushes when admitting that some errors are not due to Hertfordshire homeboy slang. So he writes \"shaw\" rather than \"sure\" \u2013 as in his \"Mike Tyson can't sing but he shaw can punch\". \"I'm getting the piss taken because of my spelling,\" Poulter concedes, \"but I didn't grow up chewing on a Collins dictionary. It's something you do on the BlackBerry when you've got a spare second \u2013 and you fire it off. C'mon. The banter is more important than the spelling.\" Poulter's empathy with people who like golf and mobile chatter rekindles a fleeting nostalgia for his teenage self. \"In 1993,\" he says, when no one but him believed a jack-the-lad from a humdrum corner of the Home Counties would even make it as a golf shop professional, \"I was 17 and three of us camped near The Belfry so we could watch the Ryder Cup. We all worked in a golf shop [the Jack O'Legs near Hitchin] but the other two were further up the ladder than me. They were both assistant pros and that's what I wanted to be. The campsite at The Belfry was full and so the lady who owned it put us in her back garden. We had curried beans every night in the tent. It was disgusting \u2013 but we were on a budget.\" Poulter, whose runner-up slot at the TPC saw him win \u00a3680,000, cackles at the memory. When he was forcing down those curried beans from a tin, in a smelly tent, did he really believe that, one day, he would be close to winning The Open? \"Yeah. I went through some old photographs last night and there was one of me riding my brother Danny's bike. Danny was four and I was two but I nicked his bike and off I went, riding without stabilisers.\" It almost sounds as if Poulter could have ridden the Tour de France this month, and twittered alongside Lance Armstrong, had he focused on cycling. \"Hardly,\" Poulter grins, before the joke intrigues him. \"I dunno, maybe \u2013 whether it's riding a bike with no stabilisers at two or winning an adults' pool tournament, like I did at nine, I just believed I'd do it. So I always thought I'd make it as a professional even though I didn't realise golfers came up through this amateur scene, and Walker Cups, rather than on-course shops. But it's done me no harm at all.\" Poulter is one of the most engaging professional sportsmen you'll ever meet, for his soaring ambition is rooted in downbeat ordinariness. He might be mouthy, but he is never pompous nor conceited. He is driven, however, and burns with conviction \u2013 despite his modest background. \"I've never even seen it,\" he sighs when asked if he has played at Turnberry. I never made it as an amateur and got to see the Open courses on the roster. But I'm more confident than I've ever been before a major. I'm in great form and after finishing second last year I'm hungry. At the TPC, on the Sunday, I played flawless under pressure. I only got beat because [Henrik] Stenson shot a 66.\" Poulter laughs quietly. \"If he hadn't done that I would've won it. But it's that wonderful word 'if' \u2013 if only Paddy [Harrington] hadn't done the same thing at the Open last year I would have won that, too. I felt I had a great chance when I holed that putt at 18. I'd posted a good number but Paddy went out and birdied 15 and eagled 17. He slammed the door shut on me.\" Is the leap from runner-up to winning a major purely psychological? \"I don't know,\" Poulter says wryly, \"because I haven't made it. But my game's in shape and I showed how tough I was mentally last year at the Open and, most of all, at the Ryder Cup.\" The snobs who dismissed Poulter as a dandy, lacking the gravitas to win a major, would have been forced to reassess after he played with such grit and zeal to emerge as Europe's leading points scorer in last year's Ryder Cup. \"That was a career-changing week,\" he says. \"As a captain's pick I was under fire. It's not nice when you read negative comments and you know you have to deliver for Europe. It's a no-win situation unless you play flawless. \"I had some real doubts beforehand. But I got myself ready and I went out and delivered. It gave me unbelievable satisfaction because it's a big thing to be the leading points-winner and the only guy to play five matches. I take that into The Open because no tournament will ever equal the pressure I went through in the Ryder Cup.\" He endured a different pressure 18 months ago when, infamously, he was quoted as saying that, once he got his game right, it would be \"just me and Tiger [Woods]\". He was also reported as saying he didn't rate anybody else on Tour, a charge he now strenuously denies. \"I'd never say that. What I meant is exactly what Paul Casey has done this year. \"Eighteen months ago he was 40 in the world and now he's No3. He's played some incredible golf and proved my point. You can't catch Tiger because he's so far ahead, but you can go from 50 to No2 if you play flawless over 12 months.\" Poulter was mocked mercilessly by his fellow pros \u2013 and Woods led the way. Whenever he passed Poulter he would say \"Hi, No2,\" and the usually loud-mouthed man from Milton Keynes, via Hitchin and Stevenage, would mumble: \"Hi, No1.\" Poulter laughs in relief. \"He doesn't say that any more, thank God. But I like Tiger. He loves the banter.\" And what about the professionals he supposedly trashed as being beneath him and the hallowed Tiger? \"They just saw it as another opportunity to take the piss out of me. The banter with the boys was good \u2013 the only thing was that the whole story dragged on. But I settled everyone down by playing so well at the Open and the Ryder Cup, and this year has been ever better.\" Does he believe he will be the world No2 within another year? \"I'd like to think that,\" he nods. \"If I carry my form I'll be hopeful because I'm really consistent now.\" Poulter might not be especially gifted but he has belief and resilience that he will soon crack the top 10. \"I'm mad enough not to ever need a sports psychologist, because I really believe in myself. I never got to study psychology after leaving school at 15 but I know how to rationalise things and get the best out of myself.\" Apart from his happy marriage to Katy, whom he met at a Luton disco, and their three children, Poulter is also energised by his design company, IJP. \"It's great. Two years ago this week we first delivered stock and it's gone amazingly quickly. We're a passionate team, and we appeal to a range from 12-year-olds to people in their 50s. We have classic styles, some funky stuff, your tartans, the works.\" This week, of course, Poulter will show off some of his funkier designs. \"On Friday I'll wear a red, white and blue set of tartans. And hopefully the weather will be fine on Thursday so I can wear a lovely cashmere Union Jack sleeveless cardigan. I can't wait.\" And yet, seeing Poulter's suddenly concentrated gaze as he moves towards Turnberry, nothing will match a march on the Claret Jug. A first major for Poulter would light up Twitter, with or without his wonky spelling. \"It's what I really want,\" he says earnestly. \"I feel my game is good enough to win and if I play well I've got a real chance. It would be some story.\" Visit www.ianpoulterdesign.com to see the latest range of clothing from Ian Poulter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
