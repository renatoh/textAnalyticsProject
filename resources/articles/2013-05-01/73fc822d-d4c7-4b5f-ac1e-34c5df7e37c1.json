Kai, whose real name is Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, has been charged with murder by police and is considered armed and dangerous. On Tuesday McGillvary had written that he had been \"drugged [and] raped\" in a post on his Facebook page. \"What would you do?,\" he asked his 2,500 followers. An arrest warrant for McGillvary was issued on Thursday. Authorities in New Jersey said his whereabouts were \"unknown\" and offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. An investigation was launched after Joseph Galfy was found dead in his home in Clark, New Jersey. An autopsy determined that Galfy had died as a result of blunt force trauma, Union County prosecutor Theodore J Romankow said. McGillvary became famous after giving a vivid account of how he used a hatchet to stop an assault in Fresno, California, in February this year. Giving his name only as Kai, the 24-year-old told reporters that he had been hitching a ride with a man who he said had deliberately driven into a pedestrian. McGillvary said the driver had then got out of the car and attacked a woman passerby. At that point, McGillvary said he had reached for his hatchet and intervened, stopping the attack. Since then McGillvary has risen to web stardom, appearing on Jimmy Kimmel's show as thousands of followers flocked to a Facebook page under the name Caleb Kai Lawrence Yodhehwawheh, which is said to be updated by the hitchhiker. Romankow said McGillvary had cut his hair in an attempt to alter his appearance. He was last seen at a light rail station in Haddonfield, New Jersey, area, Romankow added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
