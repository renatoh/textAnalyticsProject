But in 2021, the WAO will return with a program designed to be inclusive and Covid-safe. The opera-going experience \u201cmay be a little different as we keep your health and safety at the forefront\u201d, says the WAO executive director, Carolyn Chard AM, but 2021\u2019s programming is as bold and fresh as ever. Audiences can look forward to classic titles from the likes of Mozart and Rossini and exciting new works, including the first Indigenous opera performed in the Noongar language. Some of the events on the program have been rescheduled from 2020, and all productions put West Australian performers front and centre. The WAO season will also be a way for West Australians to come together and reconnect. \u201cAs we navigate Covid-19, there has never been a greater need for the power of the arts to reconnect us to our community, rewire our hearts and paint fresh colours of hope,\u201d Chard says. \u201cOur dream is to speak to the heart through the human voice. We want to share the joy of music through opera and the powerful stories opera tells.\u201d Many of the events will take place in His Majesty\u2019s Theatre in Perth, but performers will head outside for the long-running free event Opera in the Park, which kicks off the program in February. Read on for the world-class works the WAO has in store for 2021. City of Perth Opera in the Park \u2013 Gala Concert The City of Perth Opera in the Park will take the form of a Gala Concert featuring Western Australian stars in concert of opera and musical theatre hits. Ticket registration is essential. One of the biggest events on the WAO program is free and open to all. For its 30th anniversary, Opera in the Park will offer a line-up of local talent performing live opera and musical theatre hits under the stars at the Supreme Court Gardens. To ensure as many West Australians as possible can attend under social distancing requirements, two back-to-back events will be held. Playing: 8pm, Friday 26 February and Saturday 27 February 2021.

Elijah was originally due to visit Western Australia in May 2020, but Covid forced the show\u2019s cancellation. It has been rescheduled for three performances in May.

Cav &amp; Pag (Mascagni, Leoncavallo) While these two operas were not written to be performed together, their pairing has become inseparable over the years. Love, betrayal and revenge play out in a quiet village in a rural corner of Italy in Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci. In Leoncavallo\u2019s Pagliacci, performed here in a double bill with Mascagni\u2019s Cavalleria rusticana, a travelling troupe stages a comedy about a betrayed husband and his beautiful, flirtatious wife - and life soon runs very close to art in this tale of love, lust and heartbreak. Initially due to be performed in 2020, the production has been scheduled for July with a West Australian cast. Playing: 7.30pm, 17, 20, 22, 24 July 2021. Book now. Star Navigator (Finn) Star Navigator (Ihitai \u2018Avei\u2019a) is a new work that will be presented with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra for one night only on Friday 13 August. The title was originally due to be performed in 2020, but was cancelled due to Covid. The work is based on the true story of Tupaia, a Tahitian star navigator who sailed with James Cook on the Endeavour. Star Navigator explores the 1769 meeting of two master mariners, each from a vastly different place and culture, as they journey together and develop an unlikely understanding. Playing: 7.30pm, Friday 13 August 2021. Book now. Koolbardi wer Wardong (Williams, Ghouse) Koolbardi wer Wardong will make its world premiere as the first Noongar opera with thanks to the support of Principal Partner Wesfarmers Arts.
