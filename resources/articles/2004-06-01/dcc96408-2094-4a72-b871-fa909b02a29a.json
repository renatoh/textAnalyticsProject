On recent evidence, however, it might be too much to ask. A lack of effective leadership was the reason they lost to France on Sunday night - or, at least, the biggest single factor behind the sudden flight of common sense that enabled Zin\u00e9dine Zidane to snatch first victory and then even the consolation of a draw from their grasp. That injury-time disaster exposed England's all too frequent inability to channel their self-belief into positive action on the pitch. Even if one accepts that Emile Heskey's ridiculously inept challenge on Claude Makelele, which presented Zidane with the chance to strike the equalising free-kick, was an accident of war, someone should have been on hand with sufficient influence to ensure that in the next 90 seconds England did the sensible things that would have ensured the retention of a point. Instead, panic set in. Even though injury-time was well under way, a second disaster seemed likely from the moment England restarted the match, and it came in Steven Gerrard's blind back-pass. No one on the pitch possessed the vision and authority to calm the team's nerves, to order the priorities, to orchestrate a mere couple of minutes of error-free play that would have salvaged a point and preserved England's pride. In that moment, David Beckham's failings as a captain were plain for all to see. When Peter Taylor, in charge of England's senior side for a single match, gave Beckham the captain's armband for a friendly against Italy in Turin in November 2000, it is unlikely that he expected to see the No7 still leading the team 40 matches down the line. But Sven-Goran Eriksson, watching that match in the Stadio delle Alpi while serving out his notice as Lazio's manager, has seen no reason to transfer the responsibility to another member of the squad. In a sense, it must be gratifying for Taylor to have another manager so explicitly endorsing his judgment. But by continuing to rely on Beckham, Eriksson has denied the players the option of a more genuinely constructive influence. Beckham is the team's most famous player, and its most distinctive individual. No other is publicised and marketed so intensively. From the point of view of the FA's commercial activities, his status as captain is wholly beneficial. Off the field he has become a considerable asset. Over the past 3 years, for example, he has also learnt to speak to the media with greater ease. During the 2002 World Cup he became an icon to tens of thousands of Japanese fans, and the captaincy certainly helped to establish that very high profile. On the field, however, his contribution is very different. Successful international captains can come in many guises, from the flawless elegance of a Bobby Moore or a Franz Beckenbauer to the let's-get-stuck-in approach of a Didier Deschamps or a Carlos Dunga. Beckham is a genuine team player, with a highly developed unselfishness, but his real value is that of an individual. His contribution is in his crossing, his passing, his dead-ball kicks. No one has yet suggested his talents include an ability to arouse and give focus to the emotions of his team-mates. And that, perhaps, is also why England so often start matches in an ineffectual manner, lacking structure and dynamism - a fault that certainly predates Eriksson's arrival. Convinced of their own qualities, they appear ready to wait for the match to take shape rather than knowing how to impose their own pattern on it. Against France, they kept their defensive shape well enough but the absence of genuine attacking initiative was only partially obscured by a successful free-kick and a piece of individual opportunism from Wayne Rooney. With Gerrard still maturing, no replacement leader is in sight. Gary Neville, Beckham's friend and contemporary, could have made a first-class England captain, after leading teams at all levels until he arrived in Manchester United's first team and found himself a long way down the queue. Neville has a good football brain, he is not afraid to make his opinions heard, and the responsibility of leadership might even have curbed his tendency to make rash tackles. Instead his latent talent for leadership will probably find its eventual expression in a successful career in management. Like home-grown young goalkeepers, potential England captains are finding their opportunities restricted by the presence of so many senior foreign players in the Premiership. How could any ambitious young Arsenal player, for instance, expect to displace Patrick Vieira? Gerrard, thanks to G\u00e9rard Houllier's patronage, is an exception. As a result, Eriksson's room for manoeuvre is seriously limited. Everything about English football culture encourages young players to become self-absorbed, and Beckham is hardly an exception. On Sunday, Eriksson watched his captain trying to pick himself up after missing a penalty that might have ensured an important victory, something that hardly increased his ability to attend to the needs of the team. Though Eriksson brings a valuable tranquillity to the dressing room, there are times when he needs a leader who brings a different kind of strength to the pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
