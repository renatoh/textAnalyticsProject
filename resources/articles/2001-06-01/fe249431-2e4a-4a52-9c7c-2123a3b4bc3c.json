There might be a few arguments about that but none of the millions who bought Stranglers records would deny that the band's former frontman, Hugh Cornwell, possesses one of the great pop voices. More of a sardonic narrator than a singer, the voice and its owner's sense of mischief made for some of the most watchable Top of the Pops appearances ever. So it's a shame that Cornwell now languishes on the sidelines of pop. Since he departed the Stranglers in 1990, his solo career has shown no signs of igniting. Meanwhile, the band's 13-year run of hits stopped the moment he left. Such is the cold war that exists between the two parties that a reunion seems about as likely as the voice featuring in the top 20 again. Instead, Cornwell is desperate to move on; his ageing audience, however, want to hear the hits. He obliges at first, playing acoustic versions of Nice 'n' Sleazy and Golden Brown before delving into new material. He's in good humour, but when a shout of \"boring\" after a new song prompts a supposedly jokey speech about the rights of the \"artist\", you suspect he means every word. And when technical difficulties prompt Cornwell to quip, \"This is turning into a fiasco,\" you feel for the man. After an interval, Cornwell returns with Moby's former backing band and proceedings improve enormously. Exchanging jeans for a dark suit, there is something of the night about Cornwell, which makes him extremely watchable. The band (notably lacking the Stranglers' trademark keyboards) do particular justice to a psychedelic Walk on By. However, his solo material underlines that Cornwell is a rudderless ship in need of some direction. His songs - guitar pop with psychedelic tinges - are good but hardly current, and full of lyrical embarrassments, particularly the excruciating Miss Teazy Weezy. The weird funk of Mothra and the punchy Long Dead Train suggest more promising directions, but the man is imprisoned by his legacy. To rising chants of \"Hughie\", he seems comfortable with the Stranglers' lesser-known Goodbye Toulouse. But on the obligatory No More Heroes, he is singing through gritted teeth.
