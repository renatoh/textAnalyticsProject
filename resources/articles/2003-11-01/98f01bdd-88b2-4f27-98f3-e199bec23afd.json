Fancy having the nerve to recruit someone just to organise his trysts. It's not tryst, silly, it's trust - the charity Charles set up in 1976, dedicated to improving the lives of disadvantaged young people in Britain. He knew all about disadvantage as a young man. Don't mock. He funded the trust's first year with his \u00a34,700 severance pay when he left the Royal Navy. What's its budget and how many young people has the charity helped? It's raising \u00a352m this financial year; has 800 staff and 10,000 volunteers; and has helped 470,000 people. Not just by inviting them to royal garden parties, I trust? No, its work is practical: 74,000 have improved their skills and job chances; 56,000 have set up businesses; and 188,000 have been assisted through personal and community grants. Where's the fun? There is loads of it. Only last month, the Fashion Rocks show at London's Royal Albert Hall raised \u00a3750,000. Whatever happened to Tom Shebbeare, the trust's first full-time director? He's now Charles's director of charities. Grander and grander! I suppose you'd have to be in Who's Who to be considered for the job? No. As a Society Guardian reader - the post was advertised here - you could be in the running ... if you've got the right qualities. And they are? The information pack lists approachable, charismatic, outgoing, robust, decisive, confident, courageous, energetic, resilient, inspirational, motivational. They must be offering a fat package for such a high flyer? Ahem. The salary will be disclosed only to serious applicants, as these are sensitive times in royal circles. Not to be confused with: The Duke of Edinburgh awards; the prince's truss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
