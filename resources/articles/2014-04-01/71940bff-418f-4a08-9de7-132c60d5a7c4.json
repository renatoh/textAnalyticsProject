Adrian Johnson sent Newman flowers and cards and regularly turned up at the ITN offices in London. He also sent her a large quantity of emails and text messages, Highbury corner magistrates heard. Newman, who has also worked for the Financial Times, the Independent and the Washington Post, blocked the 54-year-old alleged stalker from her Twitter account. Johnson, who had bleached blonde hair, sat in the dock wearing prescription sunglasses. He held a cane and wore an electric blue jumper. He showed no emotion and spoke only to confirm his name and to plead not guilty to the charge of harassment without violence on Friday. \"The main part of the evidence is from Mr Johnson's computer; evidence from his Twitter account is in excess of over 100,000 tweets,\" Johnson's lawyer, Rebecca Cooke, said. \"He disputes that his course of conduct amounted to harassment. The complainant is a Channel 4 News reader who has Twitter and regularly tweets. She has sent emails to the defendant and has also responded to messages on Twitter. \"The defendant never received a warning of harassment but he has since been blocked from the complainant's Twitter account.\" Newman is due to give evidence at the trial, which will take place in October. Prosecutor Penny Ferguson confirmed that his case would be relying on evidence seized from Johnson's computer. Johnson was granted bail on condition that he does not contact Newman or go within 50 metres of her, and that he does not visit the ITN building."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
