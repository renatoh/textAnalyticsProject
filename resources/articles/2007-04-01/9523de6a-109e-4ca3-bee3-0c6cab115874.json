I love the idea of co-sleeping, but his movements are keeping me awake so I was thinking of the next best thing and have him next to me, but on a separate bed. I don't really want a cot with all the bars and such, but a bed-type thing where I can put up a side if I wish, at the same level or adjustable to fit my bed, and something he can grow into. And not too expensive either. Any suggestions? Lindsey Varley, Stockport Co-sleeping takes time to get used to, so if you like the idea you may like to read Deborah Jackson's excellent Three in a Bed, \u00a37.99 (Bloomsbury). I must point out that the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths (FSID) has laid out recommendations for keeping your baby safe while it sleeps (during the night and for daytime naps) and you can view these at fsid.org.uk, or call the helpline on 020 7233 2090. There are a variety of things you can do. From my experience of co-running a parenting website for the past two and a half years, lots of co-sleeping parents (who I asked advice from, for you) put their mattress on the floor with a futon or spare mattress next to it for the baby (or, more realistically, this is where the father ends up sleeping!). This gives you all the space to sleep more comfortably but it does depend on you having room in your bedroom, which I'm guessing you have from what you've said. If you slide a bed next to you for the baby (ie if you don't put all the mattresses on the floor) then you have to make absolutely sure they are at the right height for ease of use, that the beds can't move during the night and baby can't fall down or get stuck between the beds. Even though very young babies don't move much, some can be champion rollers at a few weeks old, so unless you have a wall on the other side, you will need to look at a bedrail for peace of mind. These cost from \u00a315 to \u00a325, and you can get them in a plastic/mesh or wooden, fixed or so you can drop the side down. John Lewis (johnlewis.com, 020 7629 7711), Mothercare (mothercare.com, 0845 330 4030) and most nursery shops sell them. They work by having \"arms\" that slide under the mattress. They're also useful when baby goes into his own bed and starts being able to crawl/escape. This answers your request for a \"bed with a side\". Now then, despite you saying you don't want a cot with bars (they have to have those to pass safety tests, although that said I used my old 1960s cot for my daughter, which wouldn't have passed any modern-day tests but is spectacular!), I'm going to suggest a few products for you to think about, because in my experience, sometimes readers say they want one thing and go with something quite different. I've tried to find things as reasonable as possible, but because of the nature of what we're talking about they have all ended up around the \u00a3180 mark. (So you may decide that the two mattresses on the floor is the best and cheapest solution for you.) The Humanity Family Bed, \u00a3180 (maternityandnursing.co.uk, 01273 245141) isn't a bed as such. It's a pad (more of a thick sheet) with a 1.5m bolster attached, which you can remove when you wash the \"sheet\" and of course you can use the bolster cushion independently later in a variety of uses. You and baby lie on the pad and the idea is that the bolster stops you worrying about baby falling off. I realise it doesn't address exactly your problem of wanting your baby to have its own space, but if your bed is big enough it may allow you a bit more peace of mind to move away a fraction without having to always make sure baby isn't about to tumble out of the bed. As far as cots go, Mamas and Papas does the Close and Cosy cot, \u00a3200, (mamasandpapas.com, 0870 830 7700). The side drops away and can be stored underneath the cot, and it has eight height positions so you can get it on a level with your bed, and also the wheels lock. Mothercare has one (code: C2982-092), that also has all those attributes, but costs only \u00a3179.99. Blooming Marvellous (bloomingmarvellous.co.uk, 0845 458 7408) has the Bedside Cot (code 81222), which costs \u00a3179.99, has no wheels, six positions and again you slide the side away under the cot. Having wheels or not is a matter of choice. If you plan to move the cot frequently, then it's a good idea to get them. But otherwise, considering you have to lock the castors to keep the cot stable, you still have to do a bit of shuffling off the bed when you need to get out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
