Myself and a number of other players' contracts were up [at QPR] this summer. I've found that a lot of clubs are looking through their books and trying to make cutbacks. I was offered a new deal but earning 50% less than what I earned last year, and only on a one-year basis. I am now starting at Rushden &amp; Diamonds on a one-month contract to prove my fitness and then hopefully sort out something longer term. 'I think we've got to have a new structure in place. I don't think it can carry on as it is. There's been talk of regionalisation and of involving the Scottish clubs but I think there needs to be bigger rewards for getting into the First Division. In the Third Division I can see a lot of clubs going part-time or even semi-professional.' Mark Lawrenson TV pundit 'Lasting changes will come of this. What it will serve to do is put everyone's house in order in terms of their finances. You do feel for the clubs who were promised money, but this has been coming for a long time. As a football club in 2002 you simply cannot afford to spend more than what comes in. But some good will come of it. 'The market has swung back to the clubs. They will have the opportunity to say to players, \"Right, this is the deal, we might have to cut your wages\" and \"If you want a contract, come and prove you're worth it.\" We might start to breed hungry, successful footballers again. I think it will almost be like a natural cull.' Gary Silke Editor of The Fox Leicester City fanzine 'I think we knew it was going to happen but I still can't believe it. To be honest we've not been that concerned about what's going on down there, but suddenly we're dropped in the middle of it and it's our problem too. Normally our only concern would be to get promotion and bounce straight back but with a new stadium and Premiership wages, we'll just be hoping to survive.' Rick Parry Liverpool FC chief executive 'The English game, particularly at Premiership level, is still in good health. It's not all doom and gloom like it is elsewhere in Europe, but there has been a huge reliance on television income which has been rising rapidly over the last few years. I don't think we will see the same increase when the next television deal is negotiated. We have to try and reduce our level of dependency on television money.' Gordon Taylor Chief executive of the PFA 'We need to put it into context: Heysel, Hillsborough, Bradford, they were real crises. The TV money should always have been the icing on the cake rather than the main ingredient. 'The main ingredient has to be the crowd you pull. And in those terms any other business would look at its graphs and think it was doing quite well: the total pot has never been greater and crowds have increased for 12 or 13 seasons on the trot. 'It's a problem but it's not a crisis. But it would help if the Premier League and the FA were to show a bit more solidarity with the League; they need to be more mindful of the base of the pyramid.' Ashley Cole Arsenal defender 'A lot of teams are struggling down the league. We don't see it at Arsenal but something should be done to give players lower down more money.' Stan Ternent Burnley manager 'The crash of ITV Digital has affected every league club. But the biggest loser in terms of finance is the First Division. This season will be difficult, but I don't think it's a disaster. In 12 months' time we'll be stronger for it. We have been paying far too high a percentage of turnover in wages. Players and agents will now have to moderate their demands. 'By the letter of the law there was a mistake on the ITV Digital contract. As far as the law goes, what's happened is fine. But morally they are bang out of order. This will affect all kinds of families and people, not just the footballers.' Clive Tyldesley Commentator on first ITV Digital match 'I guess football lost its innocence a few decades ago and has never quite found a sense of reality to replace it. The court case was one of those moments when the real world told football to grow up and start behaving like a responsible adult. It won't want to. Many of us would rather it never had to. 'The game is all about fantasy and emotion. But some of the people that football has done business with are not in it for such things. If football wants to play their game it may have to play by their rules. 'At times like these football turns back to its roots and its core following. Football is lucky to have its supporters. The opening day of a season is the dictionary definition of optimism. There will be little or no sign of a reality check on the motorways this morning. Everyone travels in hope, and many in expensive new team shirts.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
