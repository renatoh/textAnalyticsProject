It was widely assumed Farah\u2019s name would be the most prominent in a lengthy cull of athletes, given he retired from the track in the summer to switch to the marathon, where he is yet to demonstrate world-class ability. The 34-year-old had also indicated a run in Birmingham during August was likely to have been his last in a national vest and even handed his top to a team-mate, Andrew Butchart, at the finish. However, selectors now look likely to give Britain\u2019s most successful athlete the time \u2013 as well as the training and medical support \u2013 needed to prove he can be an Olympic medal prospect over 26.2 miles in three years\u2019 time, when his 38th birthday will be on the horizon. A number of senior athletes will be under threat when funding decisions are announced on Friday morning. They include the former 100m hurdles world championship medallist Tiffany Porter and her sister Cindy Ofili, as well as the national long jump record holder Shara Proctor, who has struggled to capture the form that won her a world championship medal in 2015. Britain\u2019s relay squads are also likely to be hit as selectors stop financially supporting athletes without serious chances of contributing a medal in Tokyo in favour of promoting developing those with the potential to hit their peaks in 2020 or 2024. The former Olympic and world 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu, who quietly retired after a disappointing performance at the national trials in July, will certainly be taken off funding \u2013 and she is likely to be one of many. Some of the names of the recent world championships are also expected to join the Olympic Podium programme for athletes with the potential to win medals Tokyo 2020, including the 25-year-old Callum Hawkins, who finished fourth in the men\u2019s marathon \u2013 the joint-best performance by a British athlete ever in the event. It is understood UK Athletics is also set to tighten its rules to ensure more elite athletes attend the national trials. This year\u2019s event was marred by a large number of withdrawals, many at short notice, and the British sport\u2019s governing body will insist funded athletes consult a doctor 48 hours before the event if they intend to miss it through injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
