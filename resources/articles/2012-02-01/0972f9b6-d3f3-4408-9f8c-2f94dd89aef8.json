In the unlikely event that the award ever extends to comedy reviews, though, it's not one for which I'd rush to be considered. I have an uneasy relationship with the hatchet job; I've never been sure whether letting rip a one-star review is an act of which I should be proud \u2013 or deeply ashamed. Yes, I've delivered a few kickings in my time (\"Never mind Trigger Happy,\" I wrote of Dom Joly's live show last year. \"My trigger finger was twitching\"). But usually I do such things with more remorse than relish. Writing about live comedy isn't like reviewing distant, untouchable movies \u2013 nor is the critic separated from the artist, as Mars-Jones was, by soft covers and a spine. The standup is a real person, right there in front of you, on their own, trying their best. And, in any case, in the age of internet trolls and reality TV boorishness, there's quite enough abuse around. I've no particular wish to add to the pile. I know that sometimes the truth has to hurt, the review has to entertain a reader \u2013 and artists' sensitivities can go hang. This, presumably, is the philosophy of the Daily Telegraph sage who once wrote about a theatre piece I performed with my company: \"In more than 30 years of reviewing, I don't think any show has made me feel physically ill before.\" Is it my own parallel career as a theatre-maker that makes me uneasy with hatchet jobs? Maybe. Is it fear of repercussion? I'm not so sure. Shortly after trashing a show by Miles Jupp, I found myself paired with him in a comedians-versus-critics golf match in Edinburgh. I spent the whole round braced for a five iron to the solar plexus, but Miles is too gentlemanly for that. So I accept that, now and then, I have to wield the hatchet, but I've never felt I deserved a prize for doing so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
