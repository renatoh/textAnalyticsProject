The Arsenal manager, who worked as Guardiola\u2019s assistant for three years until December, said he was shocked at the severity of the sanctions and had been in contact with Guardiola, who reportedly intends to at least see out his City contract, which expires at the end of next season. Arteta\u2019s comments came as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho mischievously questioned whether his runners-up medal with Manchester United two years ago could be upgraded amid a Premier League investigation into City, the champions that season. City, who strongly deny wrongdoing, have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. Arteta said: \u201cI was shocked, and being in contact with Pep and the people at the club that I know, I feel for them because I know they are suffering. The admiration and love that I have for Pep, I know how hard they work, and I hope a positive thing can come from this. \u201cI just want the best for Manchester City, I really do, because that is the way I feel. I don\u2019t think we know at the moment what can happen and if there is any further action for other clubs. I don\u2019t want to guess. I love a lot of people there and I am so grateful for the time that I spent there so the only thing I want for them is positive. I just want the best for them, and hopefully a good outcome.\u201d In 2018 Mourinho\u2019s United finished second in the Premier League, 19 points behind City. \u201cI didn\u2019t lose one single minute analysing Uefa \u2013 they have to analyse,\u201d Mourinho said after Tottenham\u2019s 3-2 win at Aston Villa. \u201c If I go into that, I have to ask if the team who finished second in 2018 [United] are going to be champions, yes or no? That would be interesting but, joking apart, I just wait calmly. I don\u2019t think about fourth or fifth, I just think about doing the best we can.\u201d Steven Gerrard, who finished second with Liverpool to City in 2014 after his infamous slip, said of the Premier League investigation: \u201cI\u2019m really, really interested in it ... for obvious reasons. It\u2019s all ifs and buts. It is what it is. Manchester City were champions. As I sit here right now, congratulations to them.\u201d The Premier Lleague, which is not commenting, opened an investigation into City\u2019s financial affairs last March. If City are found guilty the league\u2019s rule book empowers an independent commission to deduct points, though that is arguably the most extreme scenario. The timeframe under investigation is thought to concern 2012-16, when Uefa said City misstated their sponsorship income. City won the Premier League in 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
