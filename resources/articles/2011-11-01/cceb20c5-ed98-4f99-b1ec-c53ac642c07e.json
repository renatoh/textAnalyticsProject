County commissioners voted four to one to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday after reaching an impasse over concessions with the owners of the controversial bonds. The move will be a blow for JP Morgan Chase, the Wall Street bank that arranged most of the funding for the county's new sewage system and is now in the midst of a series of court actions and investigations. The move comes amid growing concerns over defaults in the $2.9tn US municipal bond market. Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg, had to file for bankruptcy protection in October after running up \u00a3300m in debt on a new incinerator. Jefferson's decision is the latest in a series from cities that have seen their budgets devastated by the recession. The crisis in Jefferson came after commissioners rejected a proposal by JP Morgan and others that would have reorganised debt and imposed an 8% increase on sewer rates for the system's 478,000 customers. Jefferson's bankruptcy would be the 11th this year and the largest since Orange County in California, went bankrupt in 1994. In 2009 JP Morgan paid $722m to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle claims that it made payments to friends of Jefferson County commissioners in order top secure financing deals. The bank paid a $25m penalty that the SEC directed to Jefferson County, paid $50m in compensation and scrapped more than $647m in fees. JP Morgan didn't admit wrongdoing in the settlement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
