These days, many are such beautifully crafted works of origami and structural engineering that they require a level of patience and hand-to-eye co-ordination usually absent in those readers who get most excited about lifting flaps and pulling tags, and there can be few things more frustrating than an interactive book too delicate to be lustily interacted with. But older children with very patient fingers will enjoy the inventive gadgetry of Ghoul School, by David Roberts and Corina Fletcher (Pavilion \u00a312.99), which is filled with gothic imagery reminiscent of Quentin Blake. Eerie towers leap out in all dimensions, disembodied hands operate wheels that turn to reveal hidden horrors behind closed doors, and desks lift to disclose tiny, detachable books and magazines such as Scream, perfect in all details including an article on deceased boy band BoneZone. Only an obsessively careful child will keep it intact for more than a week but, although the book is short and the story almost non-existent, the detail is superb and children will love the gruesome school-dinner recipes and headless corpses. For a more charming example of the genre, with more robust flaps and attachments, try Lauren Child's My Dream Bed (Hodder Children's \u00a312.99), in which a sleepy girl attached to the book by a ribbon imagines dropping off in all kinds of exotic locations, including a shell and a bird's nest, all of which you can tuck her into. Not a pop-up book, but eye-catching for its silvery photo-montage illustrations is Metal Mutz, by David Ellwand and Christine Tagg (Templar Publishing \u00a39.99), in which lonely robot Tinribs tries to build himself a canine friend from bits left in the rubbish dump. The highlight is the final page, where a hidden battery compartment enables Tinribs's new friend to bark loudly and insistently while flashing his eyes - every parent's dream. No amount of gimmicks, however, can replace the appeal of really beautiful illustrations. For years, the matriarch of children's illustration has been the prolific Shirley Hughes, and her daughter, Clara Vulliamy, proves her literary as well as literal heir with her latest story, Small (Collins Children's Books \u00a39.99). Her drawings of children are similar in style to Hughes's, though without the crisp background detail. Instead, soft colours herald an entirely plausible shift into fantasy as Tom's toy mouse, Small, sets out on an epic journey after Tom mistakenly leaves him at home. Journeys are also the focus of the latest instalment in Hans de Beer's Little Polar Bear series, my favourite of the current picture books. De Beer brings dimension and depth to his Arctic landscapes, and sets his lovable little character against backdrops of intricate detail - a Russian trawler or an icy ravine. Little Polar Bear and the Big Balloon (North-South Books \u00a39.99) even touches on the theme of environmental disaster as our hero, Lars, befriends a puffin whose wings have been damaged in an oil slick. Equally endearing is Platypus (Viking \u00a39.99), the first in a new series by The Observer's political cartoonist Chris Riddell. Platypus's adventures on the beach with a rogue hermit crab are easy to follow, and small children will love the character's friendly face and the simplicity of Riddell's clean, bright drawings - a world away from his usual Bushes and Blairs. Ruggles (Andersen Press \u00a39.99), on the other hand, is a different kind of animal hero, a shabby old dog whose spirit of adventure is not dampened by his advancing years. Anne Fine, the new children's Laureate, tells his story in his own matter-of-fact way, accompanied by Ruth Brown's very English watercolour illustrations. Ruggles has a splendidly understated voice that reminds me of a character from Last of the Summer Wine; his observations are those of a retired man wanting to escape from the house, busying himself with the goings-on in the village, always under threat of nagging when he comes home late. There's a note of reflective melancholy that creeps in, too, as Ruggles confesses in the autumn chill that 'damp gets in the old bones', and he begins to appreciate his cosy home. The only objection to this book is that the text is very small, so it's only really suitable for reading aloud. If talking animals are too run-of-the mill, you could turn, instead, to talking monsters. Jasper the Terror by John A. Rowe (North South Books \u00a39.99) is the story of a well-meaning little dragon who can't help upsetting the other animals in the forest by setting fire to their homes and trousers every time he sneezes. The pictures are big, bold and slightly surreal, and the story has an ingenious solution. But beside the usual cast of fabulous beasts are a growing number of picture books grounded firmly in the realities of modern life. Many children will appreciate the disappointment of Emily in Grandma's Beach by Rosalind Beardshaw (Bloomsbury \u00a39.99), whose working mother is all set to take her to the seaside when she gets a call from her office and has to drop Emily at Grandma's instead. Fortunately, Grandma is extremely resourceful and creates a beach in her back garden. But the finest of these 'realist' picture books is the magnificent I've Got Nits! by Mike Brownlow (Ragged Bears Publishing \u00a34.99), a cautionary tale in the style of Roald Dahl's Matilda. The Fotheringtons are so posh, they can't believe their clean little girl could get nits - 'They can't infest our lovely daughter/ There ought to be a law, there oughta!' - but her headmaster explains exactly how to get rid of them. The rhymes are hilarious and the cartoon nits will leave you scratching vigorously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
