Hazlewood has the ability to gambol between genres and periods of music, and this gave his look at the musical legacy of space exploration a pleasingly wide scope. It moved happily from Hazlewood describing Hadyn's night-sky inspired The Creation (\"jarring bits of matter slowly coalescing, not without their lumps and bumps\") to people explaining just how far producer Joe Meek would go for the right sound. \"He was even recording the loo flushing,\" we heard. Brian Eno noted that the moon landing and Woodstock were the same year, and were similarly \"improbable and almost dreamlike\". Yet, a few years later, both faded from view. Both space travel and hippy ideals, he suggested, \"never really found completion.\" Place and creativity were themes too in Archive Hour \u2013 Soho! (Radio 4, Saturday), Suggs's history of London's bohemian square mile. Some of the old clips were marvellous. I liked one chap's assertion that in Soho there were no barriers of age, class, sex or money. \"The only people who were not tolerated were bores,\" he said. \"Boredom is the cardinal sin in Soho.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
