Reflecting on the incident involving George North in a match between Northampton and Leicester, Ritchie said that while he did agree North should not have been allowed to return, he was happy with the way the Concussion Management Review Group had dealt with the issue. The CMRG decided not to impose sanctions on Northampton but made nine recommendations to Premiership Rugby to try to ensure similar mistakes would not be made again. \u201cI understand the point that people were disappointed there were no sanctions, and disappointed George was not removed from the pitch and we hope everyone learns from that,\u201d Ritchie said as the RFU announced it was investigating Sale over a possible breach of concussion management protocol. \u201cWe all agree George North should have been removed but the important thing is how do we learn from the circumstances, and how do we make it more stringent, rather than looking at sanctions.\u201d When the CMRG announced its findings in late December, the Rugby Players\u2019 Association released a statement saying: \u201cWe feel sanctions would have sent a clear message about the gravity of concussion mismanagement.\u201d Ritchie said: \u201cI was not on the panel. I have just read the report and it makes very clear the primary thing of looking after the welfare of the player was not being flouted. There is information that could and should have been made available and the recommendations deal with that. There wasn\u2019t a deliberate flouting of the protocol and therefore player welfare was still at the centre of that.\u201d Ritchie said he believed it was more important to educate teams, and that sanctions should be imposed only as a last resort. \u201cPenalties are always at the end of the spectrum\u201d for \u2018repeated and deliberate offences.\u2019\u201d Ritchie refused to criticise Northampton\u2019s behaviour in the days after the incident: \u201cWe got to the right end conclusion. Never mind the particular circumstances of the particular club.\u201d He also preferred not to criticise the Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, who said in September: \u201cAll you need to have is a slap on the head and they have you off the field for 13 minutes now. I don\u2019t know where we are going with it.\u201d Ritchie said: \u201cDirectors of rugby are absolutely entitled to their own opinions so they\u2019ll say what they say. As you\u2019ve gathered from all I\u2019ve said we recognise we need to address the challenges.\u201d The investigation involving Sale relates to their 29-26 defeat at Harlequins last Saturday, during which the back-row TJ Ioane appeared to be concussed but remained on the pitch and completed the match. \u201cThe RFU and Premiership Rugby have appointed Dr Julian Morris to be the independent chairman and will be joined by the RFU\u2019s director of professional rugby, Nigel Melville, and Phil Winstanley, the rugby director at Premiership Rugby,\u201d read a statement. Ritchie said he felt it was \u201cinevitable\u201d there were going to be more cases for the CMRG to examine and that the process would be subject to review. He felt a key question to address were whether the process could have been sped up. It took 17 days for the CMRG to investigate what happened to North. \u201cCan we do it quicker? Or is it worth giving the time because it is such an important issue?\u201d Ritchie said, adding the authorities would need to look at how to resource the CMRG. \u201cIf you are doing one a month that is one thing if you are doing three or four a week that is another.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
