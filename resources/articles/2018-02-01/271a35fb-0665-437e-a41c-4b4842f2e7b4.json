The footage shows a woman shouting at the Asian cashier behind a glass screen next to the checkouts. In the 30-second clip, recorded at the post office in Camden High Street, north London, on 4 January, the woman claims that the male postal assistant is laughing at her and said: \u201cYou won\u2019t think it\u2019s funny then, yeah. You won\u2019t be laughing then, you ignorant fuckshit.\u201d The woman begins to walk away, but then turns to shout: \u201cWho would want to look at you? What woman would want to look at that?\u201d while gesturing at the employee. She goes on: \u201cMake sure you post my cards, otherwise I\u2019ll come back and get a refund, you fat Paki cunts. Go back to your own country, yeah, you\u2019re not wanted here. You fat motherfucking Paki! Ugly motherfucker!\u201d The Metropolitan police said they were looking into the incident, which happened on 24 January, and are looking for other possible victims. A spokesman said: \u201cThe Met is committed to tackling hate crime in all its forms and we have long since recognised the impact of hate crime on communities. Victims of hate crime can be assured that they will be taken seriously by the police.\u201d The victim, a 53-year-old man, did not wish to make a formal complaint, the force added. Samrat Hanif, who was in the queue at the time of the incident, filmed the woman shouting obscenities and posted it on Facebook. It has been viewed more than 900,000 times. He said that everyone who witnessed the outburst was shocked . \u201cAll of a sudden I heard she\u2019s screaming,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she was angry.\u201d He added that he hoped the video going viral would mean \u201cthis lady will never ever do this again\u201d. Post Office Ltd said it had offered its \u201cfull support\u201d to the team in Camden, adding: \u201cWe expect all of our people to be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve and are very concerned by this incident.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
