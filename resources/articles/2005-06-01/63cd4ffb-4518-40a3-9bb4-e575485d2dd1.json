Speaking before a speech on Conservative education policy last night, he said he had not voted on how to select a leader because anyone contemplating running should refrain. Mr Cameron is thought to be Michael Howard's favoured successor and bookmakers have him as the second favourite, behind the shadow home secretary David Davis. Yesterday the 38-year-old MP for Witney used a speech on his brief to set out wider values, arguing that getting education right would bring \"a socially mobile Britain, a socially cohesive Britain and an internationally competitive Britain\". Theresa May, who has declined to rule herself out of the race, also laid out her vision for the party in a challenging speech which urged it to become \"a little more female\". Intriguingly, the shadow secretary of state for the family and for culture, media and sport asked: \"Are we really saying there is no prospect of a woman leading any of the political parties in the near future?\" Mr Cameron's wide-ranging speech to the Policy Exchange think-tank called on the Tories to set out their fundamental values and argued for \"a genuine opportunity society\" in which every life was precious. He warned against opposing the government for the sake of it, adding: \"In opposition - as much as in government - politicians need to set out what they believe in, what their goals are, and what their compass will be. \"If you don't - and if you don't stick to them - you will get buffeted from one issue to another.\" He said priorities in education would be primary school literacy; secondary school discipline; improving testing and examining systems; special educational needs; and catering for all abilities. Mr Cameron's prospects have been boosted by the decision of party backbenchers to change the rules on electing a leader, returning the final say to MPs and restricting the role of activists, MEPs and peers to consultation. Changing the rules - which requires the approval of the party's board and of MEPs, peers and association chairmen - makes it harder to depose Mr Howard before the end of the year, when he intends to stand down. Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I didn't vote at all actually ... I think anyone contemplating taking part in this contest should not vote on the new system.\" Ms May told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"I'm worried about the signal that this gives about the sort of party we are, and the sort of party we are going to be, if we can't even trust our own membership to have a say in the election of the party leader. \"What does that say about how much of a voice we are going to give to the voters?\" Ms May, a 33-1 shot for leader, argued that women should make up half of the party's 100-strong list of outstanding candidates for target seats. Speaking to a group of senior businesswomen in London, she argued that the Tories need more women candidates, more women MPs, and more senior female faces. The shadow secretary of state for the family, who three years ago warned that voters saw the Tories as a nasty party, said the Conservative brand remained very badly damaged and called for a move away from \"yah-boo\", \"macho\" campaigning. She said the party still confused ideology and dogma with practical solutions, warning that tax cuts, increased choice and localism were not ends in themselves, but \"mechanisms that sometimes work and sometimes don't\". Ms May added: \"So long as 'modernising' remains nothing more than being 'less strident in tone', or 'nicer, younger, and gayer than the Tories of the 1980s', then the Conservative Party will remain dead in the political water.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
