In a podcast first, we attempt to recreate his experiment on paranoia. Daniel also claims the condition is on the increase. An actual time lord talks minutes and seconds with us. David Rooney is the curator of time at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. This week's Science Weekly Extra podcast is an extended interview with David who discusses the decimalisation of time, as well as those pips (and no that's not the name of a band from the 60s). Ahead of this week's re-reading of the human fertilisation and embryology bill, we look at what will be discussed. Perhaps predictably, we analyse the research showing men of the north have dirtier hands. Science correspondent Ian Sample and Nell Boase from the Guardian's arts team make up this week's pod. Statistically, Nell finds out she has the dirtiest hands in the studio. Feel free to post your comments on the blog below. You can also join our facebook group too.
