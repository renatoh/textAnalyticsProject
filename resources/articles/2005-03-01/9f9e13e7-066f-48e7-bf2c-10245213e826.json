With a view to today's opening race, trainer Philip Hobbs left plenty to work on with the five-year-old prior to his latest Huntingdon win. He is rated much better than that. \u00b7For an each-way interest in the same race at good odds, look to Ben de Haan's Regents Walk (2.00). Knee problems have limited this fellow's racecourse appearances, but he has been working well and has more ability than his form suggests. \u00b7The confidence Martin Pipe's team had in Contraband yesterday is nearly matched over Comply Or Die (2.35) in the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Novice Chase. The six-year-old has enjoyed a good break since his busy autumn spell. Nicky Henderson's Trabolgan is better than he has been at any stage this season but connections just hope his jumping stands the test. \u00b7 Azertyuiop (3.15) has come through his final work for the Queen Mother Champion Chase with flying colours and is said to be in tip-top condition. Moscow Flyer is probably not the type to do much on the gallops, but we gather he recently came off very much second best in a spin with stable-mate Ulaan Baatar who was well beaten in yesterday's Arkle Trophy. \u00b7 Medison, who has missed the cut in the Coral Cup, would have been Martin Pipe's first choice but there has been market support with bookmaker Victor Chandler for his stable companion Ilnamar (4.00) , a previous winner of the race. Fitted with a visor for the first time, the nine-year-old could be returning to form. \u00b7Nicky Henderson has The Bushkeeper in good order for the Kim Muir, but it is asking a lot of this fragile chaser to win it for a second time. The stable are also delighted with French import Juveigneur (4.40), and if the rain arrives to ease the ground so much the better. \u00b7 Rasharrow (5.20) has been one of the best backed horses for the Champion Bumper with Chandler, and we gather his jockey Tony Dobbin is sweet on Lenny Lungo's runner. The claims of High Tech Made may be less obvious, but noises from the Charles Egerton camp indicate this ex-Irish five-year-old has the potential to spring a surprise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
