Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been in discussions with the 32-year-old during the close season but the Arsenal manager is reluctant to offer him a two-year deal. Pires, who has 12 months to run on his current contract, is affected by the club's cautious policy towards its players over 30. However, he is seeking more security and has made it plain that he is unwilling to prolong his Highbury career on the basis of a one-year contract extension. That has alerted Internazionale, who tried to sign him in 2003, as well as Barcelona and Valencia. Arsenal are aware of their rivals' interest and, because of his age and the length left on his deal, would have to sell for much less than the \u00a36m they paid Marseille in 2000. The Gunners, however, are hopeful that the planned move to a 60,000-seat stadium in 2006 will see Pires rethink and commit to a 12-month extension. He, though, has already considered that and the chance to move to either of the other biggest leagues in Europe would appeal to him. Of perhaps greater concern to Arsenal fans are reports that Real Madrid have joined Barcelona in expressing an interest in Thierry Henry. The striker has two years left on his contract and, although the vice-chairman David Dein said two weeks ago that he was not for sale, that has not deterred Spain's two biggest clubs. Newcastle United remain confident of signing Scott Parker from Chelsea despite the growing belief beyond Tyneside that he will move to Tottenham instead. The St James' hierarchy are buoyant about their chances of landing the midfielder and are now showing increased interest in bringing Emre Belozoglu from Internazionale as the manager Graeme Souness reshapes his midfield. Newcastle are willing to pay the \u00a34m Inter want for the Turkey international but Inter let it be known yesterday that so are two other English clubs. One of them is understood to be Everton. Newcastle sold Andy O'Brien to Portsmouth yesterday for \u00a32m and expect to see Lee Bowyer reduce their wage bill by moving to Birmingham City. Sunderland yesterday completed the signing of Jon Stead from Blackburn Rovers. He cost \u00a31.8m and Sunderland hope to be able to conclude the signing of the Ipswich goalkeeper Kelvin Davis today. Middlesbrough completed the \u00a31.8m signing of the 22-year-old left-back Emanuel Pogatetz from Bayer Leverkusen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
