Prosecutors said he was known to the ABN Amro branch as Carlos Hector Flomenbaum from Argentina and had been a customer for the past year. They released an image of a grey-haired man aged 55-60. The bank discovered the theft on March 5, believing it took place that morning or the previous Friday. The vault is used by pawnbrokers and diamond cutters. More than half the world's diamonds are traded in Antwerp. AP Brussels Senator in chain protest as Leonardo goes to Japan An Italian senator chained himself to the gates of the Uffizi museum on Monday to protest against the loan of Leonardo da Vinci's Annunciation for a show at Japan's National Museum in Tokyo. The 15th century masterpiece, due to be shipped out today, will be shown until mid-June as part of events promoting Italian culture and products. Senator Paolo Amato said the loan exposes a priceless masterpiece to unnecessary risk and using it in a commercial event is belittling. The painting dates from 1472-1475 and depicts the archangel Gabriel revealing to the Virgin Mary that she is pregnant.
