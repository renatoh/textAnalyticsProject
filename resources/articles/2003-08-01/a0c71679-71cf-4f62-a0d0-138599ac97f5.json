The Swede was at it again yesterday with a play-off victory in the HP Open at Drottningholm. Not that it was that easy. She not only had to fend off her playing partner Annika Sorenstam but had to take on Suzann Pettersen in the play-off before securing the \u00a348,750 prize with a par at the third extra hole. Sorenstam was strangely muted in compiling a 68 for third place as Gustafson shot the same score after she was disturbed by a photographer and missed a putt at the last. It left her tied on 19 under with Pettersen, who had surged through the field with a spectacular course record 62 - one better than Gustafson's Saturday round - which included a run of eight holes covered in eight under par - six birdies and an eagle - from the 7th. But it was the Norwegian who vitally missed a short par putt in extra time. Wales's Becky Morgan provided another boost to her Solheim Cup hopes by tying for fourth alongside Laura Davies on 12 under. Both closed with rounds of 70 that they agreed could have been a little better. \"I didn't play very well today, but overall it was a good week,\" said Morgan, who has now had seven top 10 placings this season, which makes her a prime candidate for one of the five Solheim wildcards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
