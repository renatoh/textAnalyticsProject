Kim Jong-un, who is in his late 20s, has been called \"the great successor\" in state media since his father's death was announced on 19 December. And as the national grieving continues, Rodong Sinmun newspaper, which is run by the ruling Workers' party, said on Saturday that the country would uphold Kim Jong-un as \"supreme commander\" with vows made in \"blood and tears\" before Kim's body. \"We urge Comrade Kim Jong-un to embrace the people's call on him to become our supreme commander,\" the editorial said. \"We will complete the great task of our songun [military-first] revolution by upholding Comrade Kim Jong-un as our supreme commander, our general.\" The young heir, who was educated in Switzerland, will be the third generation Kim to rule the country since its inception in 1948. He was promoted to four-star general and appointed a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' party in September 2010 while being groomed to succeed his father, who died aged 69 last Saturday. The third son of the late leader has little political experience and senior officials are believed to be guiding the transition. State media have heaped praise on him amid fears that his succession could meet with resistance from the powerful Korean People's Army. The appeals are expected to be followed by a declaration from the ruling party's Central Committee, announcing him as supreme commander. North Korea is to remain in an official state of mourning until after Kim's funeral on Wednesday and a memorial on Thursday. Life in the capital, Pyongyang, has been at a standstill for days with shops and restaurants closed. But the Korean Central news agency said there were signs that the nation was beginning to move on. \"Streets, buses and the metro are all crowded with people going to their work. They are not giving way simply to sorrow,\" it said. \"They are getting over the demise of their leader, promoted by a strong will to closely rally around respected Comrade Kim Jong-un.\" North Korea has emphasised the importance of family legacy during the succession movement for Kim Jong-un. State media compared the occasion to Kim Jong-il's ascension to supreme commander exactly 20 years ago on Saturday. It was one of several posts, including general secretary of the party, that Kim held before he died of a heart attack. Meanwhile, neighbouring South Korea sent huge balloons across the border loaded with socks \u2013 rather than more common propaganda leaflets \u2013 as a humanitarian gesture to North Koreans struggling with cold weather and shortages of fuel and heat. And people in Pyongyang received a special gift from the late Kim Jong-il \u2013 the distribution of fish, reportedly ordered in the days before he died."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
