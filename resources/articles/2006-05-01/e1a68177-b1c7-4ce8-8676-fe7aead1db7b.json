Just think: you get paid-for transport, sometimes even in extra-squashy seats that have a little table for you to put your drink on, you get to stay in a nicer hotel than you could afford for yourself, and all you have to do in exchange is do some work and you'd be doing that anyway. Squint a bit and it's almost like a holiday. But hear that sound? That's the hollow laughter of seasoned business travellers everywhere, who can only think of interminable transport delays, dire hotel rooms, and endless evenings with unbearable colleagues with nothing to do but drink yourself into oblivion. \"It's quite nice sitting in business class, I suppose,\" says Anna Williams, a lawyer who travels frequently to Europe. \"But you're still on a plane and it's still quite boring. I don't like flying anyway. And then you have to get off the plane and be business-like when you feel crumpled and like you need a shower.\" Scott Robbins, a designer with clients all over the country, says: \"Business travel to me just means nights in soulless hotels watching boring TV or working because there's nothing else to do.\" And market researcher Helen Atkins says: \"It just means lots of hangovers and telling colleagues things you wish you hadn't by the next morning.\" But until video conferencing becomes something other than a way to frighten the PAs who have to set up the equipment, business travel will remain a fact of life. Don't worry, though, business trips have something to say for them apart from just racking up some air miles. \"Let's face it, a business trip can be quite exciting,\" says Gladeana McMahon, head of coaching at Fairplace. \"And if you go away with colleagues it can be a great networking opportunity and a chance to build relations in the company.\" But there are potential pitfalls, too. \"Travelling with colleagues can create a false camaraderie,\" she says. \"There is lots of dead time while you're travelling and meals out where you can maybe sink one too many glasses of wine. But remember: you've got to go back into an office environment with these people and you should be careful about what you say about yourself.\" If you're with colleagues and would rather not indulge in endless drinking sessions in the hotel bar every evening, or even just want some time on your own, it's fine to say so. \"There can be a bit of a group mentality that because you're together in a strange place you should be together all the time,\" agrees McMahon. \"But you don't have to join in. If you decide not to, stick to it.\" On the other hand, if you're feeling a bit shy with new colleagues, forcing yourself into being a bit sociable might pave the way to beneficial working relationships - and beats falling asleep in front of the flickering light of VH1. On a long trip, factor in time to switch off. The problem with business travel is that there's no end of the day. Even if you're socialising in the evening, unless you're close friends with your colleagues you might be exhausted by making small talk. Try not to work all evening, either. A walk round town is preferable, surely. Taking a few home comforts with you isn't a bad idea. \"Make sure you've got a good book and plenty of good music on your iPod,\" says McMahon. \"If you're away for a long time, think about maintaining your rituals - such as the newspaper you read and programmes you watch regularly - because those are the things that make you feel 'at home' wherever you are.\" And don't use business travel as an excuse for reverting to slob-like behaviour. Get enough sleep, at least think about ordering a salad from room service and make use of the hotel gym: staying sound in body will help you be sound in mind in your client's offices. Finally, the key to a successful business trip is preparation. Make a checklist before you leave and be rigorous about going through it. There's nothing worse than opening your briefcase to retrieve an important document to realise that it's still on your desk - 3,000 miles away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
