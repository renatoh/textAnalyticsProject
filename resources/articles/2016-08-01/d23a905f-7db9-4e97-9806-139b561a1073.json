Beazley, an outspoken critic of the US presidential candidate since concluding his stint as ambassador earlier this year, has written for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute about the dangers of a Trump presidency for the Australian alliance. The former Labor leader told ABC\u2019s AM on Wednesday a Trump presidency would \u201cbasically trash the structure of alliance and trade relationships in our region\u201d. He said although Trump had \u201cnever aimed anything at us\u201d he would \u201cdestabilise enormously the relationship we have in the north part of Asia with Japan and [South] Korea\u201d. In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Beazley took aim at Trump for suggesting South Korea and Japan should defend themselves, even if it involved conflict with nuclear-armed North Korea. \u201cSpecifically on this he said if the plans he has in mind for [the] relationship with Korea and Japan cause those countries to contemplate nuclear weapons, well good luck to them \u2013 that was his position, go ahead and do it.\u201d Beazley said North Korea could consider pre-emption if South Korea developed nuclear weapons. Australia would face a challenge of \u201cskilled advocacy\u201d, in having to \u201cwean [Trump] away from the lunacy\u201d of this foreign policy, he said on ABC\u2019s AM. The former ambassador called for an \u201cimmediate, forceful and sustained\u201d response if Trump were elected. \u201cYou\u2019d bring to bear all the force of a very close ally in changing the mind of a particular leader in the US.\u201d On Sky Beazley said Australia should not close joint military facilities with the US, because that would be \u201ccutting off our noses to spite our faces\u201d. But military cooperation should make Trump, if he were elected, listen to Australia\u2019s concerns. Beazley doubted the ability of the US political system to check Trump, because he could undermine alliances without legislation, for example, by saying he would not activate a security guarantee, or interfering with trade, or issuing executive orders to border agents. Beazley took aim at Trump\u2019s remarks that second amendment advocates could stop Hillary Clinton appointing judges to the supreme court, interpreted as hinting at her assassination. \u201cThis morning \u2013 it\u2019s just one outrage after another \u2013 he\u2019s basically calling on supporters of the second amendment to shoot Hillary [Clinton]. I mean really, how far can this guy go?\u201d Beazley told Sky News Trump\u2019s support was largely confined to white, working class males, and the comments would \u201cput a lid\u201d on his ability to appeal to other groups. \u201cThe American voting public needs to have words with him on that.\u201d Beazley said Trump was mobilising white working class men to vote in greater numbers but also mobilising Hispanics to vote against him. \u201cI think in the end he\u2019s going to start mobilising women [against him]. The combination of all the counter-mobilisations should hopefully keep him out of the White House,\u201d he said. Beazley said the \u201cmost immediate risk\u201d of a Trump presidency to Australia\u2019s relationship with China would be attacks on free trade. \u201cIf that destabilises the Chinese economy, well it destabilises our principal trading partner.\u201d Beazley said he was not sure Trump could implement plans for 45% tariffs on China without legislation, but said there were \u201can array of punitive measures available to him\u201d including tariffs on individual products and enforcement of anti-dumping provisions. \u201cHe could make a mess very quickly of a very critical trading relationship with China.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
