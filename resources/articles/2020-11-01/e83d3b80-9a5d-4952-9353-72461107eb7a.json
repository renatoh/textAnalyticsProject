The Liverpool centre-half collapsed in agony and now faces a wait for the results of scans to determine the severity of the damage. The early signs are not good and the problem deepens his club\u2019s defensive selection crisis. Gareth Southgate said he was \u201cpraying\u201d for a positive diagnosis while the goalkeeper Nick Pope described how upsetting it was to witness the plight of a player who missed the 2018 World Cup because of serious injury. \u201cJoe made a pass or a movement with no-one around him and ended up on the floor,\u201d Pope said. \u201cHe was in a great deal of pain. When you see one of your friends or teammates go through that, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who sold centre-half Dejan Lovren in July and did not sign cover, is already without his star central defender, Virgil Van Dijk (knee ligaments) and the full-back, Trent Alexander-Arnold (calf). He has been without Fabinho, who has played at centre-half, because of a hamstring injury, although he hopes to have him back after the international break. His only other established option in central defence is Joel Matip, who has just returned from a muscular problem. Gomez had played virtually every minute of Liverpool\u2019s seven games in 22 days since the October international break and Southgate said he had given him an extra day of recovery at the start of the week following his involvement in Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Manchester City. \u201cAnd yet this has still happened,\u201d Southgate said. Like many managers, including Klopp, Southgate is frustrated at the volume of matches that the players have been asked to play in this most unusual of seasons. He believes it will lead to many more unfortunate injuries. \u201cWhat was upsetting was to see that Joe was in a fair bit of pain and the fact was there was nobody around him when the injury happened so I didn\u2019t like that element of it,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to wait and see what the scans show and we\u2019re all hopeful for him that it\u2019s not what it might be. But it\u2019s not a good situation. \u201cOne of the worst things as an international manager is that you are borrowing players and something happens on your watch and you feel a responsibility and you start to go back but, in this instance, there is just nothing we would have done differently.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
