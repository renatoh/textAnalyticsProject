His victory over Spadea marked the first time since he took the title here a year ago that he has won two main tour matches in a row, but there is more work to be done, and urgently. He is currently 110th in the world rankings, but if he fails to beat the former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson today and thus goes out before the semi-finals he will fall outside the world's top 150 for the first time since 1993. He will also be down to the ignominious position of being British No3 below Arvind Parmar, who was beaten 6-4, 7-5 by Victor Hanescu yesterday. Rusedski's victory against Spadea was a further sign of improvement and put him a step nearer defending all the ranking points he earned here in 2003, but the trend must continue here and again at Wimbledon, where he reached the second round last year. Even he admits that simply maintaining his current position will require a huge effort. \"The more matches I get, the more chance there is of me doing well at Wimbledon, but it's highly unrealistic to expect too much of me there because I haven't had enough matches,\" he said. If he cannot make the most of playing at home and on grass, his favourite surface, he will find himself either relegated to lower-tier events commensurate with his ranking or reliant on the wildcards which he believes were promised to him by the ATP, the governing body of men's tennis, after his exoneration by an anti-doping tribunal in March. \"I don't really have to worry about rankings if the ATP helps me out over the summer,\" he said. \"That's going to be crucial. If I can pick up some points then hopefully by the end of the year I won't have to worry about wildcards.\" If ranking points were awarded for unquenchable optimism, Rusedski would be a world-beater, but he finds himself in circumstances which must be testing even his relentlessly rosy outlook. Tournaments in places such as Los Angeles and Indianapolis may insist on giving their precious stock of wildcards to young Americans rather than a 30-year-old Canadian-born British player who is attempting to finish his career on something approaching a high note. \"People keep writing about me retiring, but I'm going to be around for at least another year,\" said Rusedski, as bullish as ever. \"I still feel like there are things I can achieve. By the end of my career I want to be able to say I did my best.\" The British No4 Jonathan Marray's impressive grass-court season was halted when an ill-timed attack of nerves robbed him of his first ATP Tour quarter-final appearance. The world No250 lost 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 to the world No75 Flavio Saretta having served for the match at 6-5 in the second set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
