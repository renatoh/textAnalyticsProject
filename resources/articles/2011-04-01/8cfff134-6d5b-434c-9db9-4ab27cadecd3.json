Bolting on Sly Stone's horns, and \u2013 words you thought you'd never read \u2013 a genuinely thrilling harmonica solo from Hollies sessioneer Tommy Morgan, this sweetly defiant tale of striding out and ignoring the haters survives all Holmes can throw at it. Here's hoping new label Bella Union get their chequebooks out should Acker Bilk, MC NxtGen and Tang from Zingzillas be called upon next. Ella Chi Gobstopper (Conehead) Remember that skinny MC who Cheryl Cole took a shine to on X Factor? No, us neither. But this is how she'd have sounded had Cowell And Co (like Legs And Co but with higher waistlines) got their hands on her. By the time Chi's perky pop-reggae descends into an alarming grindie rock-out, you'll hate yourself for having liked it, but as she helpfully points out, \"You should watch your lip/ Giving too much gyp/ You need a gobstopper baby\". Asa Dreamer Girl (Dramatico) As someone who occasionally buys comps of eager 70s soul acts from Lagos striving to emulate Aretha Franklin, it's heartening to note that a) They're still at it, and b) Someone's now invested in a Nigerian soul diva. Here, Asa assumes the folk-funk stylings of Linda Lewis, borrows the flutey mellotrons from Strawberry Fields Forever, and weaves them into a production so breezy you might reasonably whisper \"new Sade\". Hot City Go Bang (Moshi Moshi) It all went a bit Radio 2 there for a minute, so here's a dispatch from the dancefloor. Allegedly Hot City's bass squelches and ravey Latin stabs are an antidote to \"dubstep po-facery\", and operate at the nexus of big-room house and UK funky. It can't just be me who'd sooner spend a month in a diving bell with only the Max Cooper remix of Portishead's Roads for company than set foot in said big rooms; and, really, this is about as funky as Nicholas Soames playing air baton. The Raveonettes Recharge &amp; Revolt (Vice) The Raveonettes had one good idea in 2002, opting only to record in B Flat Minor (their next CD was in B Flat Major, the sellouts). Their latest wheeze is playing the riff to Teenage Kicks into infinity and mumbling over it. In the vid, Sune Rose Wagner lugs a flag about. We don't see quite where he plants it, but it should be the Reading festival circa 1992, as this couldn't be more shoegazey if it tried. Mazes Most Days (One Little Indian) With an eye for the fitting metaphor, Mazes record on a ship in the Thames, bobbing in the wake of dredgers taking the capital's shit off to landfill. \"There go all the Carl Bar\u00e2t CDs!\" they must cackle, before shotgunning an Ace and chugging through Buddy Holly-goes-Ramones surf-pop gems like this.
