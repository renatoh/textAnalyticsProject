She writes: Forsaking the freezing cold and the nonstop meetings here in Davos, I'm scrolling through my Twitter feed. Some of the tweets are scary (\u201cCalifornia\u2019s drought from space\u201d) and others are downright frustrating (\u201cEurope relaxes renewables target\u201d), but most of the headlines I\u2019ve seen during this essential global climate meeting give me hope: \"India nearly doubled its solar power capacity in 2013\", \"China boosts 2014 solar target\", \"Texas first state to reach 10,000 megawatts of wind capacity\". In spite of climate policy gridlock, the conversation about climate change in the business community has progressed exponentially in the past couple of years. The business world is acting with more urgency. Just last week at the UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk in New York City, dozens of investment banks, insurance companies and institutional investors announced significant financial investments in clean-energy projects that will benefit their bottom lines and help limit climate change. It\u2019s no surprise that businesses are responding. Climate change is wreaking havoc on company supply chains, and cost-competitive renewable technologies are available to replace the biggest climate change culprit: fossil fuels. Solutions for tackling climate change are at our fingertips. Companies and investors must invest more in clean energy, and policymakers need to level the playing field, setting a price for carbon pollution and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies. At least one thing is clear today from Davos: the rest of the world has moved on and isn\u2019t waiting for climate policy to catch up. Dara O\u2019Rourke, a professor at UC Berkeley and the co-founder of GoodGuide.com, is the chair of WEF's Global Agenda Council on Sustainable Consumption. He writes: \ufeffOne thing that has surprised me in my time in Davos is how often I\u2019ve heard CEOs complain about how hard it is to promote sustainability and social responsibility inside their companies. In session after session, it has been clear that even the most powerful CEOs feel that transforming their organizations is hard. Very hard. In one of the few \u201cpublic\u201d sessions where CEOs talked about this, the panelists presented a long list of impediments to changing business for the good, including: a few bad apple companies (which have sunk public trust in corporations to record lows); investors (which think too short-term); the media (which only runs negative stories and beats up on them even when they try CSR); corporate boards (that are too share price focused); government regulation (which causes more problems than it solves); and consumers (who think green products perform worse and won't pay more). My first thought is that these sound like a bunch of scapegoats. (Interestingly, I haven't heard the same litany in sessions about technological disruptions and supply chain innovations.) Further, what about the role of the CEOs themselves? And of the ways that some corporations undermine the institutions needed to address global sustainability issues? But my second thought is that these are believable stoppers to sustainability. Short-term investors? Check. Conflicted boards? Probably. Selfish consumers? Sure. Although no single one of these is the root cause of sustainability failures, together they create enough barriers to block most sustainability initiatives inside corporations. That brings me to my third thought, if each of these barriers can block sustainability initiatives, then how do we align systems and incentives to move sustainability forward? And can strong leaders push past these blockages? For instance, it was fantastic to hear that Richard Goyders, the CEO of Wesfarmers, no longer meets with short-term investors. And to hear Marks &amp; Spencer and Unilever talk about engaging consumers in new ways. But clearly, unique CEOs and individual corporate actions are not enough. We need partnerships - including NGO and government action - to address these blockages, and to create incentives for firms to push through them. We need ways to align supply chains to solve problems, instead of allowing any one barrier to block everything. As one CEO quipped: Average CEOs do what average investors demand. It\u2019s time for exceptional leaders to create partnerships to push past these limits. Jo Confino and I (Caroline Holtum) are signing off now, but we're handing over to our US colleague Jennifer Kho who has a few more stories to share with those west of Europe over the next few hours. Be back in the same place tomorrow for the final day where the circular economy will remain on centre stage. Jo Confino adds a dash of pessimism to proceedings as he reflects on Davos so far: Has over-optimism infected Davos? The reason I ask this is because the pessimism over the economic crisis that infected the World Economic Forum in recent years, seems to have dissipated. But, this desire to put the crisis behind us may be a chimera. Some at Davos still worry that there are great systemic risks and that the recovery remains fragile. This over-confidence comes despite the fact that youth unemployment hangs over Davos like a black cloud, with all the social risks that this entails. The issue is being discussed here, but there is a paucity of ideas, with experts still relying on what has tended to fail in the past, namely skills development and training. While the economy is picking up a little steam, it is unlikely to create the jobs that are needed to bring youth unemployment down significantly. So all the more reason why governments need to back the 'green' economy, which is most likely to generate growth and employment. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen any time soon, given that many governments are choosing to abandoning the modest environmental commitments they had already made. Jo Confino spoke with Kumi Naidoo, the international director of Greenpeace International who told him that we are on the verge of possible game changing interventions [on deforestation], but wouldn't say we've got there already. Asked where the real action is taking place, he said that some governments and some businesses are driving the change. He specifically noted the 'significant shift' by the Indonesian government and increased interest from developed country governments like Norway. On the business side, he said those who use forest products like Nestle and Unilever have been moved by citizens, who have said they don't want to consume products that destroy forests. On the producer side, movement has been achieved by pressure. Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, who used to be really aggressive in their opposition to Greenpeace, have now invited Greenpeace to help them make the transition to sustainability. We managed to grab a couple of minutes with Connie Hedegaard, she was the Danish minister for climate and energy during Copenhagen and is now the European commissioner for climate action. She takes a stand against the large European business lobbying organisations, saying that they are holding progress on sustainability back. She also reminds us that it is not unusual that business thinks short-term; that is why you need politicians who dare to think long-term and take short-term decisions that don't work counter to where we should be going in the long-term. Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute makes a pre-launch announcement about Global Forest Watch, an innovative new tool for tracking where deforestation is actually taking place. Accurate, timely information isn't accessible at the moment; by the time deforestation is detected 'cattle are already grazing amongst the stumps'. Here's what he had to say about the new tool: Everywhere I go I hear the same refrain from business leaders: we want to do our part to protect forests, but we need better information about what\u2019s happening at the end of our supply chains. This is true in Indonesia, Brazil and the Ivory Coast. But, things are starting to change. A quiet revolution is underway where lower cost technologies and global communications are giving businesses, governments, and forest managers much faster and more complete information. WRI and our partners are leveraging these changes. Next month, we are launching Global Forest Watch, a major new initiative that uses satellite technology, open data, and human networks to show where and how forests are changing. You will be able to view forests at a 30 meter resolution worldwide. This information can be shared by everyone with a computer and in formats they can easily act upon. We\u2019ll be previewing the platform in Davos, where businesses are making ambitious commitments to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. Let\u2019s hope that more business and governments will join this effort. A strong call to action from Ikea's Steve Howard, he tells Jo Confino of his frustration at companies that are saying one thing publicly and another behind closed doors about climate change. If you don't want to end up on the wrong side of history, then it is time to put this at the top of your public affairs agenda, he says. A small hint of optimism creeps in as he also says that climate is back on the agenda in a way that it hasn't been since before Copenhagen. Scott Poynton, founder and executive director of TFT, a global NGO that works with companies to develop responsible products had this to say about corporate commitments on deforestation in advance of this afternoon's session on ending deforestation in supply chains: In the past three years, many companies have made bold policy commitments to rid their supply chains of deforestation. Getting to the point of making the commitments has been challenging enough but the real work comes in implementation. Wilmar, the world\u2019s largest palm oil company, made a significant announcement last December, committing to no deforestation, no exploitation of people and no peatland development across its entire business \u2013 yes, including all the third party oil it trades. This is hugely significant, not only for the palm oil industry but for all agri-commodities. If Wilmar can do this for palm, why can\u2019t others do it for soy, cocoa, sugar, beef, etc? Wilmar\u2019s announcement marks a breakthrough and strong implementation is now underway but the true breakthrough will come when others follow suit. Deforestation is happening because we suck it through our supply chains. At Davos, let\u2019s hope those meeting in the ending deforestation session agree to make their own bold commitments and then set about implementing them to seriously reduce the scourge of deforestation. I have been speaking with Danish environment minister Ida Auken who says there needs to be a concerted effort to ensure that water becomes a post-2015 development goal in its own right, rather than being split between various targets. Here is what she had to say: \ufeffWater is the foundation for life. Did we forget that? It seems as if a lot of leaders still take water for granted. But the the fact is that in just 16 years from now, half of the world\u2019s population will be living in areas with water stress. This is an unacceptable outlook. The World Economic Forum has acknowledged this threat and identified it as the number three global risk we face. But what to do about it? We discussed this in a session here in Davos and agreed that we need a global sustainable development goal (SDG) dedicated to water. The goal should include targets on all three aspects of water \u2013 social (access to water and sanitation), environmental (water quality) and economic (water efficiency). A global goal on water can help steer development and investments and it can guide leaders in all fields, not least political leaders. But a global goal on water will not be easy to get. So we all need to start lobbying now. If you have an opportunity to influence any UN-ambassador in New York, do it. If you can impact your national government to support such a goal, do it. And if you get a platform to speak up, tell people that if we are to set ourselves goals for a sustainable future, we must have a goal dedicated to water. Towards the end of yesterday, just as the snow started to fall, Jo Confino talked to BT's chief sustainability officer Niall Dunne and Accenture's Asia Pacific strategy practice &amp; sustainability services managing director, Peter Lacy about engaging millennials in the climate change equation. In the run up to the COP21 climate negotiations in 2015, there's much that brands can do to create demand among young people for sustainable products and services and to engage them in an open conversation about climate change - video World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim today called for everyone to put their \u201cnecks on the line\u201d by creating bold solutions to climate change ahead of the UN summit in September. Kim said that UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon had taken a big risk by calling the summit and it was the duty of politicians, businesses and NGOs to work together to ensure it did not end with empty promises. Kim said that countries were starting to respond to climate risks, highlighting initiatives in Thailand, Chile, South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria. In the wake of the recent devastation in the Philippines, Kim said the country now wanted to develop an innovative climate resilience insurance fund. He also called for a scaling up of green investment funds, saying that the World Bank hoped to create green bonds worth $50 billion by the time of the global climate talks in Paris. \u201cAll these initiatives have to be brought together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot fall into the trap of waiting for a political agreement before moving. By working on very practical initiatives and getting something moving on a stable price of carbon, we can create a platform that makes it easier for politicians to reach an agreement. We can all act now. There are so many win win win situations.\u201d While Kim appealed to peoples\u2019 business sense, he also gave a very personal appeal for action. Pointing out that his youngest son may still be alive in the year 2100, he said: \u201cOh my god, we try to give people a sense of urgency by 2030 but even that is not working yet. All our children and future generations will ask of their ancestors; what did you do when you knew about the impact of climate change.\u201d On climate day at Davos, Greenpeace's Kumi Naidoo and Oxfam's Winnie Byanyima call for a concerted effort from progressive companies to push governments to set tougher climate change targets. They highlight big food and beverage companies as among those that have the most to be gained from standing up and being counted on climate change: \ufeffTheir bottom line is under threat as extreme weather and shifting seasons threaten to disrupt their supply chains and drive higher and more volatile commodity prices. They should be doing much more to tackle their own emissions, including switching to 100% renewable energy in their operations and by taking the lead in ditching suppliers who recklessly cause deforestation. They should use their substantial power and influence to demand action from governments and not allow big polluters to dominate business groups such as the International Chamber of Commerce. With exceptions, their modest role in national and global debates on climate action to date has been striking given how much they have to lose. Read the full piece here. If you read Achim Steiner &amp; Rachel Kyte on green bonds earlier, and wondered how they work, the World Bank have a handy guide. Jo Confino has managed to grab a few minutes with UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. She says she is encouraged by the diversity of opinion on climate change at Davos and impressed by the extent to which it has been included on the WEF agenda. (Apologies for a slightly noisy recording) Bill McDonough, designer and author of Cradle to Cradle, laid down a challenge to business go beyond doing less bad and do more good. He was called 'the mastermind of sustainable design' by Al Gore in the session he just hosted and had a few words to say to Caroline Holtum: Hannah Jones, vice-president of sustainable business and innovation at Nike, is at Davos and has been writing about the immense complexity of mainstreaming the principles of the circular economy into the company\u2019s core operations. \ufeffWhile Nike-led technologies have greatly advanced the integration of sustainability and performance, materials innovation is not a problem we can solve alone. Creating a sustainable palette of materials would be disruptive to the world of production, but it\u2019s also incredibly complicated. The production of Nike footwear and apparel is contracted to around 765 factories globally. Materials for those products are supplied by hundreds more vendors. And those products use a palette of more than 16,000 materials. And that\u2019s just Nike\u2019s supply chain. It is clear that no single company, organisation or government has the ability to tackle this innovation challenge on their own. Instead, it will require new models of collaboration. We need to catalyse capital, capabilities, science and technology and resources far beyond the boundaries of our own supply chain. To tackle massive systemic challenges like those in the materials and manufacturing industries, Nike is harnessing the collective power of unconventional collaborations. Our ability to positively influence the systems in which we operate is critical to our future success. Read the full article on the WEF website. I've been speaking to Paul Simpson, the CEO of global NGO CDP, who has just come out of a debate on the risk of stranded carbon assets to capital markets. This is what he had to say: \ufeffThe IPCC, which has shown we have already emitted more than half of the one trillion tonnes of our total carbon budget, has alerted the world to the limits of emissions. This means that a significant percentage of fossil fuel reserves needs to be kept in the ground to keep us within a maximum two degree warming. The discussion concluded that stranded carbon assets present a potential material risk to the global economy and compared this to the risk of inflated real estate assets that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis. The meeting focused on the need for better disclosure from fossil fuel companies on the potential of their reserves to be stranded and their plans of how they intend to respond to this. Given that current accounting rules do not require them to do this , the discussion concluded that institutional investors and financial market regulators must take action to make this mandatory. Interestingly, the governor of the central bank of Korea, Kim Choong-Soo, who was present, said he could not initially understand why he had been invited, but after hearing the speakers, said he now recognised it as a significant issue for his country. I caught up with Michael Porter and asked him about Unilever CEO Paul Polman\u2019s recent comment to me that Porter's \"shared value\" concept is no longer radical enough. This is what he had to say: \ufeffWe think shared value is tremendously radical. It redefines how business operates at the core \u2013 how they think about their products and value chains, how they think about the boundaries of their responsibilities. A lot of companies are still on the journey between CSR and shared value and have not made the truly radical transformation of seeing society and social issues as being a core part of running the business. Paul uses the label of sustainability for much of their work. We believe that sustainability is not necessarily shared valued; it is a broad catch-all phrase. We have been accustomed for too long to believing there is a trade off between profitability and doing good which has fostered a culture that makes it profitable to pollute and make factories an unsafe place to work. But this idea is Alice in Wonderland; actually societal problems are the greatest business opportunity to restructure how you operate, to become more productive. Selling products to Africa is not doing good but a giant new market. But this takes a long time \u2013 CEOs often see the opportunity but it\u2019s difficult driving it down into the organisation, where staff are used to thinking narrowly. Porter gave the example of Dow Chemical which had created new billion dollar businesses after deciding to look at how the company could contribute to the Millennium Development Goals. The circular economy is a great concept but heck, it is difficult to bring into reality. These are the conclusions of a World Economic Forum (WEF) report launched today in Davos. The study points to mouth watering savings of $1 trillion a year by 2025 and the creation of 100 000 new jobs within five years. But like may other radical new business models it requires a systemic change, which no single business or organisation can bring about on their own. That\u2019s because the circular economy relies on the eradication of toxins from products so they can be up-cycled. But even the most simple products can contain hundreds of different substances, which each need to be tested. Not only is that an uphill task of its own, but many suppliers plead confidentiality and refuse to even tell their customers what materials they use. This is why WEF, in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is launching Project Mainstream; a collaboration of businesses that will focus their attention on a few key products that will have a global impact. Read Jo Confino\u2019s full report here. A bit of light hearted relief from the Coca Cola party last night. London Mayor Boris Johnson is always a tease and thought it was a great idea for the Guardian to publish this photo of him being \u201cbought\u201d by Coke. Here he is with his own personalised Coke can, along with Muhtar Kent, the CEO of the drinks giant. Johnson joked that while he should not announce it, Coke was going to become the next corporate to sponsor his Boris bikes scheme in the capital. This, of course, may not be a bad idea given that Coke is focussing on wellbeing and encouraging people to exercise. Was Johnson being more serious than he was letting on? Only time will tell. Our colleagues over on the business desk are bringing you all the latest news from the congress centre, where Larry Summers, former US treasury secretary is currently on stage. You can follow their live blog here. Rachel Kyte, group vice president and special envoy for climate change at the World Bank, echoes Achim Steiner's reflection on the positive outcome of yesterday's session on finance and the green economy. She sent us this update: Following on from the Investor Summit on Climate Change in New York earlier this month there has been lots of discussion about the future of green bonds. Zurich Re, some weeks ago, indicated that it would buy $1bn in green bonds. Discussions in this session sought to encourage others to follow suit. Can infrastructure, energy and other companies follow EDF and issue corporate green bonds, was the other question up for discussion. And Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank asked why not aim to double the size of the green bond market to $20bn by time of the UN Leaders Summit in September and double it again (or more) to $50bn by the Paris climate summit in December 2015. Doable seemed the response. An impactful result if the growth expands the universe of investors going into green assets. Achim Steiner, the executive director of UNEP gives us a whistle stop tour of his day yesterday: Davos! Big debates, big brains, big names. My day consisted of 16 hours of non-stop meetings with people full of ideas, sometimes full of themselves but all important in some way. The water session this morning : it must be progress when CEOs, ministers of finance and presidents focus on the global water crisis even if the answers only semi-reassuring. Next session: getting sustainability into the DNA of business. I listened to some real pioneers in the business world. I see some real shifts here, but why still so few leaders? The debate centred on what to do about the average CEO. Then agriculture and climate change, two big topics in Davos this year. From big agribusiness to consumer groups and ministers sitting in a big circle in real debate on solutions; most are still locked in to a 'more of the same but better' mode. A new UNEP report tomorrow will show dramatic loss of arable land across globe. Next, a session with Ban Ki-moon, Jim Yong Kim and leaders of the finance world. Will they commit to scaling up their funding for a low carbon green economy? Surprisingly, the answer was a yes. Watch the finance space! I also had many 'bilaterals' in the course of the day. One stood out: a young woman from India who has set up an inspiring social enterprise on the environment. WEF finds and invites these young global change makers to the table: another ingredient that goes into making Davos interesting. Good morning from a snowy Davos. We'll be bringing you all the news and views on sustainability and business as day three progresses. And a busy day it promises to be, we'll be hearing from Al Gore, William McDonough, Michael Porter and a host of others.
