Monet was, of course, a master of colour: a man obsessed with the emerald green of water lilies or the blue of a pond, subjects he drew obsessively, again and again. Now his most famous painting of all \u2013 Impression, Soleil Levant or Impression, Sunrise \u2013 is being shown in the southern hemisphere for the first time. Monet: Impression Sunrise, which opened this week at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA), tracks Monet\u2019s early inspirations and influences. It also shows later works of the French master including Haystacks, Midday (1890) and Waterlillies (1914-17), both of which are in the NGA collection. The centrepiece, however, is 1872\u2019s Impression, Sunrise \u2013 the image that inadvertently gave the impressionists their name. \u201cIt is modest in scale but its role and its position in art history is enormous,\u201d says NGA director Nick Mitzevich. \u201cAustralian audiences have a good knowledge of Impressionism, but this is the missing part of the puzzle.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s like a little exquisite jewel \u2013 it just sucks you in. That\u2019s the mastery of Monet: these simple brush strokes, these very carefully applied bits of raw colour. The shadowy stacks of boats and industry as the sun is rising. You get this sense of an early morning moment through fleeting bits of colour and brushstrokes.\u201d Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, owners of the largest Monet collection in the world, rarely loan out Impression, Sunrise \u2013 and usually only for a month at a time. The work, however, will be on show in Canberra for almost triple that time in a new 650 sq m space reserved for temporary exhibitions. The extended exhibition length is largely a bid to highlight research that the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet conducted on the painting in 2014, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of its opening. Among other things, Marmottan Monet has pinpointed the exact location of the view of the port of Le Havre that Monet painted in Impression, Sunrise. It also established that the picture depicts sunrise, not sunset \u2013 a matter that had divided art historians. Impression, Sunrise is not only significant for its beauty \u2013 with its depiction of a bright orange sun rising above a hazy sea \u2013 but for the name it gave to impressionism. In 1898, Monet told La Revue Illustr\u00e9e how he came up with the title: \u201cThey wanted to know its title for the catalogue [because] it couldn\u2019t really pass for a view of Le Havre. I replied: \u2018Use impression\u2019.\u201d NGA\u2019s Simeron Maxwell assisted the exhibition\u2019s curator Marianne Mathieu, scientific director of the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet. Maxwell explains that in the late 19th century the word \u201cimpression\u201d was \u201ca common term to mean a really quick sketch of something: \u2018impressions\u2019 were not to be exhibited, they were not seen as finished works. But Monet turned that on his head and said why isn\u2019t it finished?\u201d While critics were, on the whole, unimpressed by Impression, Sunrise when it was first exhibited in 1874, Monet now commands huge prices. Meules, a painting in his seminal Haystacks series, was auctioned last month by a private collector for US$110.7m (A$160m) \u2013 making it the most expensive impressionist painting ever sold, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Other artists included in the NGA exhibition \u2013 who either influenced Monet or were influenced by him \u2013 range from English painter JMW Turner to female impressionist Berthe Morisot. Frenchman Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, who encouraged Monet to take up landscape painting and to paint outdoors alongside him, also features. Many of the 60 works on display have been borrowed from the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet as well as London\u2019s Tate. Private collections in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and US have also lent works. Mitzevich hopes that Monet: Impression Sunrise will give local audiences \u201can insight into where impressionism came from.\u201d \u201cThe show is a meditation on one painting and it\u2019s before and after,\u201d he says. \u201cWe literally walk you through his inspiration.\u201d \u2022 Monet: Impression Sunrise is open at the NGA until 1 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
