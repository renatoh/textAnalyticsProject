That's not how they do on the Sussex coast, however, and instead the Brighton Japan festival has spent the last week celebrating the country's vast cultural resources that have shone like beacons in the face of the most severe adversity. It finishes this weekend with the third outing of the Anime Festival, taking in film screenings (Redline and the original 1954 Godzilla), cutesy J-pop performances, and fashion shows showcasing the Victorian doll-style Lolita look. There's dressing up of a different kind in a Cosplay competition, plus bonkers live Japanese-style gameshow action, Manga art, and taiko drumming. Various venues, Sat, Sun, brightonjapan.com Stuart Goodwin I Love West Leeds Festival, Leeds The citizens of West Yorkshire may be ambivalent about north, south and even east Leeds, but the fact that this festival is now in its seventh year shows that there is a lot of love out there for the westerly parts of the city. The arts are very much to the fore here, with the Big Free Festival Day next Sunday offering family-friendly visual arts and hands-on activities for all. Outdoor films include The Damned United in Armley, and there's intriguing art installation in the shape of Kevin Hickson's washing lines. You can also join heritage trails, have breakfast with artists and enjoy the musical finale at Bramley Baths.
