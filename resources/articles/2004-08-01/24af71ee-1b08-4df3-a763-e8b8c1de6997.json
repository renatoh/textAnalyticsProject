I love the page in T2 that gives you pictures of the highlights of the previous day's news with a quote underneath. I like The Ethicist, where they say things like: my granny's best friend dropped her lottery ticket down the side of the sofa and it's worth \u00a310,000, and should I give it back? I think that's funny. I occasionally read the Mail, although it's becoming increasingly irritating because it's so anti-feminist. Magazines: I read all River Publishing's customer magazines and Marketing, Campaign and Media Week. I like Tatler and Harper's because they're both quite journalistic. I like the combination of media and fashion without it being too girly. I read Vogue, Red and the investigative stuff in Marie Claire. I also like to get a lot of extreme sports magazines about skiing. Books: I get through about four to six books each week. I'm doing a PhD in marketing, so I read one or two brand bibles every week. I read horror, largely to find out about the psyche of my competition. I like beach books because they're easy to read and they connect you with Joe Public. TV: I watch the 6.30am news on the BBC. I watch sport and I love EastEnders and Footballers' Wives. Cutting It is my absolute favourite. Big Brother has got a bit odd - they're terribly sad people. Radio: I listen to Chris Moyles on Radio 1 because he's funny and he's consumer and half of our magazines are, so I can't afford not to. Ads: HSBC's private banking poster campaign is excellent. It has greying men - and they're always men, which is so frustrating - in a glider or power boat or with scuba diving equipment on, with someone helping them. It's all about having enough money to pay for personal service. New media: I tend to go to brandrepublic.com a lot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
