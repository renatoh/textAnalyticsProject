So an element of defiance commingles with a new sense of self-acceptance on this British troubadour\u2019s expansive third album title. The songs follow suit. A sizable US audience now figures in Kiwanuka\u2019s reckonings, thanks to the success of Cold Little Heart \u2013 from his second album \u2013 repurposed as the theme tune to HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies. Kiwanuka is equal to the challenge, combining Kiwanuka\u2019s Stateside-facing retro soul with broader, occasionally more Afrocentric influences. Best of all is this album\u2019s borderline psychedelic shimmer \u2013 the mostly analogue atmospheres Kiwanuka and producers Danger Mouse and Inflo conjure up here are just as enticing as the more conventional songs, which merge Motown fun and more languorous introspection. Skip straight to Piano Joint (Intro) for a taste of this album\u2019s more free-form grooves, or to Hard to Say Goodbye for 60s orchestral cinematics; listen as Hero, a side-on tribute to the civil rights movement, builds from a husky ballad to a rattling period piece faintly redolent of Jimi Hendrix. The only downside is that Kiwanuka could have been even braver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
