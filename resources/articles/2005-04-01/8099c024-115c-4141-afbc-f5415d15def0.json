The pretext is the decision by a few Japanese middle schools to use some history books next year that gloss over Japanese wartime atrocities... But Chinese resentment goes deeper, and focuses on what it sees as the repeated failure of Japanese leaders and society to make a full apology for their wartime record... \"South Korea has also objected to the textbooks and Japan's paltry efforts at atonement for Korean 'comfort women', forced into wartime military brothels. But China has exploited and exacerbated historic bitterness for political purposes: first, to divert attention from domestic tensions over economic disparities, unemployment, corruption and political restrictions; and second, to limit Japan's influence in Asia.\" Philip J Cunningham Los Angeles Times, April 11 \"Japanese politicians and publishers have made a cottage industry of denying the 1937 Nanking massacre in which the Japanese killed hundreds of thousands of civilians... This is an offence to Chinese sensibilities comparable with Holocaust denial in Europe... That tacit government approval is given to such xenophobic, rightwing thinking can be seen in the latest ministry of education-approved school texts that erase or evade such critical lessons drawn from Japan's bad behaviour in its war of aggression.\" South China Morning Post Editorial, April 11 \"Widening and increasingly violent protests against Japan are bringing relations between Beijing and Tokyo to a precarious crossroads. To avoid Asia's foremost powers turning down a path that will endanger regional stability, both must make the strongest efforts to avert a crisis. That nationalism is rife [in China], and increasingly so, is inevitable. Chinese should be rightly proud of their country's achievements. It is lamentable, though, that in some quarters, pride is being turned into an excuse for public animosity towards Japan.\" Korea Times Editorial, South Korea, April 11 \"Tokyo's approval of history textbooks which further distort Japan's war crimes... has touched off a spate of anti-Japanese sentiments in South Korea and China as well as enhanced their nationalism... Seoul and Beijing have already declared their objection to Tokyo's bid to become a permanent member of the UN security council... \"We sincerely urge Japan to put an end to its retrogressive and narrow-minded approaches toward its past and look back at it with the eyes of its Asian neighbours.\" Japan Times Editorial, April 9 \"It is certainly important to teach children about history, but a first essential step in history education is to make them think about how Japan should live peacefully with neighbouring nations. The classroom is not the place to play up disputes. If the state censorship of textbooks is contributing to frictions between nations, it should be abolished.\" Ben Thirlway Japan Today, April 11 \"Ask nearly any Chinese on the street about their Asian neighbour and you'll hear the phrase 'I hate Japan'... So what are the root causes behind this amazingly strong hatred? Let's look at China itself - a large, unruly, fractious country comprising around 200 distinct ethnic groups. Abandoning communist ideology in its drive for material wealth and prosperity, China's government has resorted to stirring up nationalism in a bid to maintain a sense of identity and purpose... Chinese hatred survives - even thrives - among the young because the government will not allow it to die.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
