Beth Hyland\u2019s new musical, loosely based on Chekhov\u2019s The Seagull, attempts to refocus the narrative. Trigorin \u2013 a global rock star in this version \u2013 is pushed into the wings, leaving singer-songwriter Nina in the spotlight. At its best, Seagulls homes in on the misogyny of the music industry \u2013 and culture more broadly. A gifted musician in her own right, Nina soon gets tired of languishing in the shadow of boyfriend and bandmate Con. He wants a muse, not a partner. But in leaving him behind and taking the opportunity offered by Trigorin, Nina walks into a world where she can never be sure if she\u2019s valued for her talent or her looks. As pretentious dreamer Con, Matthew Heywood has the moody, posturing entitlement of every wannabe male genius, while Flora Spencer-Longhurst\u2019s ambitious, witty Nina slices right through his self-importance. It\u2019s just hard to believe that this self-absorbed man-child would also capture the affections of Lauryn Redding\u2019s gloriously sardonic Masha \u2013 whose boyfriend Simon (Tomi Ogbaro) is just as helplessly devoted to her. Plastered with posters and festooned with fairy lights for Lotte Wakeham\u2019s production, Bolton\u2019s library has the convincing feel of the student union where the quartet\u2019s band plays. The music is one of the show\u2019s highlights \u2013 especially Nina\u2019s pointed song Muse \u2013 but elsewhere Hyland\u2019s writing can be clumsy and formulaic. While the shift to Nina\u2019s perspective is welcome, in many ways this narrative of aspiration, fame and disillusion still feels like a story we\u2019ve heard a hundred times before. \u2022 At Bolton Library and Museum, until 16 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
