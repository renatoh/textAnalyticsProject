In the circumstances the best suggestion is to play safe and go for a runner with proven form in the big sprint handicap and, perhaps, one who has shown form over further as this will be the usual fast-run race over what is a stiff six furlongs. Injaaz fits the bill and there was a big move in the betting for her yesterday. She has shown much improved form since being dropped to this trip and, after winning in eye-catching style at Goodwood, was beaten a short head by the consistent Halmahera in a valuable handicap at Doncaster last week. She should turn the table on that horse at the revised weights and has the invaluable service of Mick Kinane on board. Seven-furlong winner Royal Millennium has a touch of class and looks fairly treated, despite carrying third top weight, while similar comments apply to Capricho Indeed, Capricho has carried on improving since winning the Wokingham, disqualified after dead-heating with today's opponent Mine in the Bunbury Cup after failing to carry the proper weight and subsequently beating Attache over seven furlongs at Goodwood. However, there was a lot to like about the way Attache travelled in that race before getting run out of it in the closing stages and Michael Jarvis's runner looked even better last time when returning to six furlongs and beating Affaire Royale with a superb turn of foot at Haydock. Attache (4.05) has winning form at much further than this but has really come into his own at sprint trips and the time of his latest victory compared favourably with the Group 1 Haydock Sprint run on the same card. AYR 1.45: Airwave, unlucky when sent off a heavily backed favourite and fourth in the Doncaster Sales race, looks the one to be on after the fifth home, Monsieur Bond, boosted the form with an excellent second in yesterday's Mill Reef Stakes NEWBURY 2.00: Cotopaxi, trained by Venetia Williams, has improved beyond all recognition over hurdles this summer and could be thrown in here. AYR 2.15: This will be tactical affair and Vintage Premium, who is always up with the pace, could set up the race for the classy Island House who won this event two years ago. NEWBURY 2.35: Repertory, Smokin Beau and Lady Dominatrix will set some pace here and that will suit the in-form Bishops Court, who is drawn near to that trio in a favoured high-numbered stall. AYR 2.50: The draw isn't ideal but the Cambridgeshire candidate Unshakable has everything else in his favour. His trainer won't hear of defeat and the early-morning price of 5-1 with the Tote seems sure not to last long. Muchea has been in tremendous form, winning his last two, but has it all to do with top weight. NEWBURY 3.05: Marcus Tregoning's horses are back after a bout of coughing and if Bustan can reproduce his close fourth to Bandari in the Great Voltigeur at York that looks good enough. Legal Approach, from Mark Johnston's stable in form, looks the likely danger and met his only defeat at Windsor last month when third to Arctic Owl NEWBURY 3.40: Persian Lass may have been flattered by her close second to Miss Corniche earlier in the week at Yarmouth, but she had shown progressive form and should go well for a stable with an excellent record in this race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
