Backing for oil and gas operations in Oman, Kuwait, Brazil and other countries, amounted to more than a quarter of the total commitment by UK Export Finance (UKEF), the government agency responsible for promoting British exports with credit, guarantees, loans and insurance. The amount was more than double that committed to the high-emitting sector in any of the past four years, according to an analysis by the investigative environmental journalism outlet DeSmog UK. Britain claims to be a climate leader even as it promotes companies that contribute to greenhouse gases overseas. Last month MPs declared a climate emergency but faced criticism over climate plans deemed inadequate by environmentalists. This month parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee said the UK was sabotaging its climate credentials by providing \u201cunacceptably high\u201d subsidies that locked poorer nations into a fossil fuel future. A separate study this year found the UK led the European Union in giving subsidies to fossil fuels. UKEF said its support for oil and gas helped ensure the competitiveness of an industry in Britain employing 300,000 people. A spokesperson said the agency \u201cfully recognises the importance of tackling climate change and the need for a mix of energy sources and technologies as the world transitions to a low carbon economy\u201d. In a press release UKEF headlined the latest figures as the \u201cbest results for 28 years\u201d even though its annual report acknowledged high potential environmental and social risks for several of the projects. The agency\u2019s biggest single energy deal last year involved \u00a3734m in support of the Duqm oil refinery project in Oman. Other large sums were the \u00a3248m for oil exploration in Brazil, \u00a3171m for an oil refinery in Kuwait, and several hundred million for power projects in Iraq. The total \u00a32bn support for fossil fuels last year compared with \u00a3175m in 2017, \u00a3857m in 2016, and \u00a3432m in 2015, according to DeSmog. The figures did not include the aviation and the motor industry, though Airbus, Boeing and Norton Motorcycles also figured prominently on the latest list of supported projects. Companies selling pipeline surveillance equipment to Kuwait, Qatar, India and China, also featured. By comparison, support for renewables last year slumped to \u00a3700,000, and covered mostly wind turbines in the Netherlands and Germany. Kerry McCarthy, a Labour MP and member of the environmental audit committee, said the agency needed to clean up its act. She said: \u201cThese shocking figures show UKEF is increasingly undermining attempts to tackle our climate emergency. Instead of making renewable energy a priority, as UKEF assured us they were doing when they appeared before our inquiry in March, their own accounts show that support for fossil fuels has increased more than tenfold over the past year. Not only that, support for renewables has declined by a third.\u201d Outstripping all of them were arms deals, which topped the list with more than \u00a33bn support for weapons systems and Typhoon aircraft sold to Qatar, and with several million pounds for explosive ordnance purchased by Saudi Arabia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
