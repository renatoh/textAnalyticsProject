The first quake had magnitude of 7.7 and struck off the Gorontalo area of Sulawesi island, Indonesia's meteorological agency said. The second had a 6.0 magnitude. Indonesia last week launched a new hi-tech system aimed at detecting a potential tsunami and providing faster alerts in a region battered by frequent earthquakes. The sprawling archipelago of some 17,000 islands is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. The US Geological Survey put the first quake 54 miles off the coast and 13 miles beneath the sea. The second, less powerful, quake was at a much shallower depth of 6.2 miles. In December 2004, a massive earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island triggered a tsunami that battered much of the Indian Ocean coastline and killed more than 230,000 people 131,000 of them in Indonesia's Aceh province alone. A tsunami off Java island last year killed nearly 5,000 people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
