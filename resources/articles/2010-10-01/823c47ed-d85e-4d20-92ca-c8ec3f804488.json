From one point of view, this doesn't much matter. Modes of expression advance with technology. If people don't produce hand-written letters any more, that's because they've found more efficient \u2013 or exciting \u2013 ways to communicate. But in another sense, the disappearance of letter writing is an incalculable loss. For much of human history, letters have illuminated the past and enriched our understanding of great writers and artists. That we know about medieval love is thanks largely to Heloise and Abelard; Van Gogh's letters to his brother, Theo, provide an essential understanding of his art; Keats's letters to Fanny Brawne likewise help explain his poetry, as well as being literary masterpieces in their own right. Ours is an age in which correspondence is still being archived and published, as superb new volumes from Bruce Chatwin, Philip Larkin and Saul Bellow \u2013 featured in today's New Review \u2013 demonstrate. But the era in which these three writers lived might well prove to be the last in which the letter was the pre-eminent form of written communication. Now that email has taken its place, what does this imply for future historians and biographers? It is often said that we live in an age of information overload and that everything in cyberspace is permanent. But communication via the internet has a transitory, fragmented and cursory quality which seems likely to work against the construction of coherent future archives. Will book-lovers in years to come be able to read The Collected Emails of Zadie Smith in the same way that we can enjoy Bellow's letters? Inky manuscripts contain insights that can be lost forever to the backspace key. It is a curious paradox. We live in an age saturated with commentary, obsessed with recording the moment. And yet we could end up understanding less about people living today than about those who came before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
