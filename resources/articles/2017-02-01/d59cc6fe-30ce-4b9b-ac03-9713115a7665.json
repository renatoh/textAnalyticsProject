It has effectively killed the government\u2019s attempt to force nearly $4bn in savings through the Senate. Neither Labor nor the Greens will support the bill as it stands. \u201cI understand there are all sorts of consequences of this decision,\u201d Xenophon told the ABC\u2019s Radio National program on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying every savings measure should not be passed. We\u2019re saying that the trade-off, in respect of the family tax benefits and the childcare package, as good as it is, comes at too high a cost. \u201cWe want to see if there are other savings measures that won\u2019t have that harsh effect on families.\u201d The government\u2019s omnibus savings package includes multibillion-dollar cuts to family tax benefits, paid parental leave and unemployment payments, with some of that money used to pay for extra funding for childcare. The government ignited a political brawl last week by dusting off previously rejected cuts to welfare benefits, such as making young jobseekers wait a month before they can access benefits, and linking them to its long-awaited childcare reform package. Then, on Monday afternoon, the government tried to ramp up pressure on the Senate crossbench \u2013 after months of negotiations \u2013 to pass its welfare cuts associated with its childcare package by announcing $3bn of the proposed savings package would be allocated to a special account to fund the full roll out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The move sparked an angry reaction from political opponents and disability advocates, with Xenophon warning on Monday it was \u201cdumb policy and dumb politics\u201d to link future funding of the NDIS with billions in welfare cuts. \u201cAs negotiating tactics go, this is about as subtle as a sledgehammer,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. He said the government \u201cshould not pit vulnerable Australians currently receiving family tax benefit against another group of vulnerable Australians wanting to access the NDIS\u201d, saying the move potentially complicated his support for the package. Xenophon said he would continue talking with the government. Christian Porter, the social services minister, told ABC radio on Tuesday he wanted to have another talk with Xenophon. \u201c[Xenophon] does not consider it is a mechanism that he can support to find savings inside the family tax benefit system to pay for childcare,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear on that from the beginning. We want to keep working to make sure than people benefit from the childcare reforms which again, as Nick noted, seem to be widely lauded. \u201cThere are 1 million Australian families who\u2019d benefit from those childcare reforms and they are particularly focused on ensuring that families and mums who are less well off but who are working and want to work more, or who want to engage in the workforce for the first time, disproportionately benefited.\u201d The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie criticised the bill on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday, saying: \u201cI can tell you what they can go and do with their omnibus \u2013 they can stick it where it fits.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
