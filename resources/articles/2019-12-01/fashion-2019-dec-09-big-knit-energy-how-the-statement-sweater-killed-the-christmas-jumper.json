But that\u2019s what has just happened with Chris Evans, whose muesli coloured Aran knit in the murder mystery Knives Out has a) utterly broken the internet b) made people rethink their life choices, based on a desire to get intimate with a piece of clothing. Or, as writer Ira Madison III put it: \u201cI just ordered Chris Evans\u2019 sweater from Knives Out and I can\u2019t wait to **** it.\u201d Quite. Even the film\u2019s official marketing has nodded to the fact: in an official video statement, \u201cthe film everyone\u2019s talking about\u201d has been amended to \u201cthe sweater everyone\u2019s talking about\u201d. (Evans, himself, touchingly admitted he nicked the, what I\u2019m now referring to as the Charlie Bit My Finger of Wool Garments, off the film set to presumably set fire to it, in case it elbowed him out of the way and got cast in a new Captain America franchise). The Knives Out jumper is part of a new trend for the The Statement Utility Jumper. Recently, we\u2019ve also seen the ribbed, tight-fitting jumper in the No Time to Die poster, where James Bond looks as if he is both #humblebragging about his pecs but also semaphoring an edgy, ready-for-the-apocalypse vibe (all in all, very War Core). And Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse, going quietly off-kilter in ribbed, wide-necked jumpers. These jumpers feel imbued with a pre-worn history and a heavy attitude. As Knives Out costume designer Jenny Eagan said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the sweater or who\u2019s wearing the sweater.\u201d The Statement Utility Jumper is all very \u201cBig Knit Energy\u201d (Hi, Sarah Lund) and exactly the opposite of The Christmas Jumper that, in contrast, has all the dark energy and presence of Crazy Frog\u2019s cover of Last Christmas. In interesting timing, the Christmas jumper was officially cancelled last week when charity Hubbub said they were bad for the environment. An early Christmas present for anyone who felt the juddering, in-coming horror at the thought of wearing their Hotline Bling jumper to the Christmas party next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
