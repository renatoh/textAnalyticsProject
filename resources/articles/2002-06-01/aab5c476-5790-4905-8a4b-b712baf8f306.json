The rider always looked confident on the son of Polar Falcon, who made all the running to beat Secret Spoof by three lengths. Hills said he was looking forward to Epsom where he teams up with Esloob in the Vodafone Oaks tomorrow and Bandari in the Vodafone Derby on Saturday. \"They are having a lot of rain at Epsom and that won't worry any of my Classic mounts. It was soft when Esloob finished third in the Fillies' Mile at Ascot last autumn so we know she handles it - she is a very good filly,\" said Hills \"Bandari has won on the soft too so conditions will be to his liking - but not only that, it will put a greater emphasis on stamina and that might not be good for the favourite [Hawk Wing]. It could be a great weekend.\" Kevin Darley was at his confident best as he brought Donna's Double home in the S G Petch Launch New Seat Ibiza Handicap. Don Eddy, who trains the winner, said: \"I did not back him today, I had got fed up of him being brought too soon and being beaten.\" Ian Semple, who has histeam in fine form, having sent out winners at Sandown and Redcar on Monday, kept up the good work when Robert Winston brought Arogant Prince home a one-and-a-quarter-length winner of the Parklands Golfcourse Claiming Stakes. The Carluke trainer, who has his sights set on the Royal Hunt Cup for stable star Kelburne, said modestly: \"We have had a good run, but to be fair the horses have held their form all through the winter and the question now is how long will it last. \"But it is nice to keep the ball rolling and as far as Arogant Prince is concerned he takes no training, all you have to do is make sure he keeps his head in the feed manger - he takes no work. He might run at Pontefract next week.\" It looked as if Darley was going to double up on Blythe Spirit in the xtremesports.it Handicap, but the gelding threw it away by hanging left in the last furlong and he was run out of it by Mick Easterby's Cat's Whiskers, who stayed on well under a determined ride from Dale Gibson. Keith Dalgleish has a good record for Tim Easterby, and he teamed up with the Great Habton trainer's Roman Mistress to take the Gerrard Investment Management Maiden Stakes, scoring by length from Treaty of Utrecht."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
