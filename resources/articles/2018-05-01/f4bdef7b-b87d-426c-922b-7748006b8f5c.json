Economist Saul Eslake, who wrote the report for the Australian Conservation Foundation, found neither Australia\u2019s sovereign rating, nor the ratings of states and territories, had ever been affected by environmental policy decisions made by governments, although such decisions could affect foreign investors. ACF commissioned the report to address the use of the words \u201csovereign risk\u201d by federal MPs in relation to the Adani project. In March the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said he did not like the Adani mine but scrapping it would be a sovereign risk. \u2022Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He made the remarks after former ACF president Geoff Cousins gave an interview on the ABC\u2019s 730 in which he said the Labor leader had told him he could commit to revoking Adani\u2019s mining licence but then changed his mind. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, has described Shorten as \u201cwalking sovereign risk\u201d for hardening his stance on the project. Eslake said the term \u201chad a much more precise meaning in financial markets than the way it\u2019s bandied about by politicians.\u201d \u201cSovereign risk is about the risk that a government defaults on its debts and clearly Adani has nothing to do with that,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say a government decision to withdraw the Adani Carmichael mine permits would be a sovereign risk would be completely abusing the term.\u201d The report argues that over the past decade the term sovereign risk has been used more broadly to apply to almost any government policy that might adversely impact investors. But it goes on to say that Australia\u2019s sovereign debt rating has not been affected by past policy decisions made by governments on environmental grounds, such as bans or restrictions on unconventional gas exploration in the states and territories. \u201cThere have been numerous examples in Australia over the last 40 or so years where governments have made these decisions that have had some impact on foreign investment without impacting our credit rating, or the credit ratings of states, or without having perceptible effects on flows of foreign investment,\u201d Eslake said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think that a decision by future governments to revoke whatever approvals might have been given by another government for the Carmichael mine might affect our credit rating or material ability to attract foreign investment.\u201d Rob Henderson, a former chief economist of markets for NAB, said there was no evidence that making decisions on environmental grounds impacted Australia\u2019s credit rating. He said the Gillard government\u2019s minerals resource rent tax was \u201ca glaring example\u201d of a substantial policy change that had an impact on the mining sector. \u201cWhat happened afterwards? The mining sector had the largest investment boom in its history,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing that is the elephant in the room is that all the major Australian banks have effectively ruled out investing in the Galilee Basin mines on environmental and climate change reasons.\u201d Comment was sought from the opposition leader."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
