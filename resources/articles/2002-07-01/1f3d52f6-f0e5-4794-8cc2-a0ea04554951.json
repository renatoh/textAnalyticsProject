The former Yugoslav president, charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in the Balkans, dismissed reports of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo as \"nonsense\", Norwegian ex-foreign minister Knut Vollebaek told the UN tribunal in the Hague. Mr Milosevic is accused of responsibility for driving 800,000 Kosovo Albanians from their homes in 1999 and killing around 900 during an ethnic cleansing campaign. Refugees fled to Macedonia and Albania with their possessions piled on tractors, said Mr Vollebaek, who met Mr Milosevic several times to try to broker peace in the renegade province. \"There were endless lines of tractors with families on them. I think it was one of the most moving moments of my life,\" he testified. \"When I confronted Mr Milosevic with that, he said they were just picnicking, so I shouldn't be concerned. They were just on a trip having a picnic,\" said Mr Vollebaek, former chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE withdrew 1,400 observers from Kosovo in March 1999, days before Nato began its air campaign against Yugoslavia. Mr Milosevic is also charged with war crimes in Croatia in 1991-92 and in the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He declined to plead and judges entered not guilty pleas on his behalf. He does not recognise the court and is defending himself. \u00b7 A former Yugoslav soldier has been jailed for eight years for the killing in May 1999 of two Kosovo Albanians, in the first war crimes case to be tried in a Yugoslav court. Ivan Nikolic, 30, was found guilty of \"war crimes against the civilian population\" by the court in Prokuplje. He shot dead two ethnic Albanian civilians in the Kosovo village of Peduh, while serving with the Yugoslav army."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
