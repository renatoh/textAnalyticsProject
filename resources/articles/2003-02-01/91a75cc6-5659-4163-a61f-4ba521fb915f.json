West Indies - Chris Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Brian Lara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper (captain), Ramnaresh Sarwan, Ricardo Powell, Ridley Jacobs, Vasbert Drakes, Mervyn Dillon, Pedro Collins. Preamble Afternoon everyone. Both teams need to win this one - the Windies will be as good as out if they lose, while Sri Lanka would have to beat South Africa in their final group game - so it should be a cracker. Let's hope so, although if it's an anti-climatic shambles, at least I'll get to leave work nice and early. Not that I want to give you the impression that I woke up with a very sore head and would rather be anywhere but work, or anything. The toss Sri Lanka won the toss and will bat. As we've seen, batting first in the day/nighters seems to give a side the edge, as it tends to get a bit damp in the darkness. More swing, slower outfield, etc. And the visibility, oh the visibility. The pitch It's hard and dry, and there's not much grass on it. The outfield is lush and green ... a 25-degree-centigrade sun is blazing down from the Cape Town sky ... why am I stuck in a room in London with no window? Anyone who fancies joining me in sounding off about their job / lot in life should feel free to do so. 1st over: Sri Lanka 2-0 Mervyn Dillon opens the bowling, Marvan Atapattu faces. Dillon's first ball is fine, with a tad of movement off the seam. His second ball kicks up and finds an inside edge - or is it a glove - and spoons off to leg slip, where there's no man. There's a bit of bounce in this wicket. Sanath Jayasuriya confuses himself and inadvertently sends the ball to deep fine leg; no catch, one run. \"As we all know, batting first on a night game is not just an advantage, it is tantamount to four points should the game not get rained off,\" writes a resigned Spencer Jones. \"Therefore, there isn't really a point in bothering with the cricket commentary, and you're just here for the banter and to keep Andrea Lowe occupied.\" That's it, Spencer, sell it to the readers for us. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 10-0 Jayasuriya goes after Pedro Collins, cutting the ball over second slip and away for four. A tatty first over but a nice final ball that moves off the seam and nearly nicks off Atapattu's outside edge. \"You mean your tight-fisted Guardian bosses didn't even pay for you to go out there?\" splutters Robert Dean. \"And here was me with visions of the lucky commentators sipping cold beer in the sun.\" Don't get me started on this, Robert. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 11-0 A good over from Dillon, conceding the one run as Jayasuriya nudges the ball to square leg. \"I'm emailing to whinge,\" writes Tom Crane, getting into the spirit of things. \"I'm off on holiday after work today, but I get the distinct feeling I'm coming down with some sort of cough/cold.\" WICKET: Sri Lanka 11-1 Atapattu run out 3 The batsmen hare after a run that was never there as Jayasuriya toks the ball to short leg. Bowler Collins, following up superbly, picks the ball up and rolls the ball towards the stumps. Atapattu is miles from the crease as the bails sail into the air. 4th over: Sri Lanka 12-1 Tillekeratne is the new man in, and he's off the mark third ball with a single. Gordon Gibbs writes: \"Not related to the cricket at all, but while walking through Streatham last night, I noticed a cabbie stopped at a set of traffic lights. Not a common sight in Streatham. Even stranger was the fact that said cabbie was sporting a cowboy hat and singing along to Elton John very loudly. He seemed to be having a whale of a time. Not being from south of the water, can anybody confirm whether or not this is par-for-the-course behaviour from the eight taxi drivers who seem to ply their trade in the deep south? We've got loads of the buggers up north, but I can't ever recall seeing one looking quite so happy.\" 5th over: Sri Lanka 15-1 The Sri Lankans are on the back foot here, with the Windies attack finding good line and length. A couple for Tillakaratne, but the best Jayasuriya can do is slice a ball away to third man for a spawny single. Jayasuriya's on 8, Tillekeratne is on 3. \"What does Tom Crane have to whinge about?\" whinges Robert Jackson. \"A couple of snuffles? He's going on fecking holiday for god's sake. It's us people with no holiday to look forward to / hangovers / deathly jobs / no girlfriend / going-to-London's-worst-venue-the-Clapham-Grand tonight who should be whinging. And I am.\" 6th over: Sri Lanka 17-1 Sri Lanka nearly suffer another run-out as the batsmen scamper for a single after Jayasuirya pushes the ball to square leg, where Chanderpaul dives forward and wheechs the ball towards the stumps. He misses, which is a good thing for Tillakaratne, who's nowhere near the crease. \"I don't know about happy,\" writes Robert Dean, \"but I once got a lift with a socialist taxi driver who was all for upping taxes and banishing the Tories to Daily Mail Island.\" 7th over: Sri Lanka 20-1 Sri Lanka are on the back foot all right. If the Windies had a man in at leg slip, Tillakaratne would be walking, after spinning round like a top and clacking a terrible outside edge into the air. It's safe, though; one run. Apparently, Matthew Smith sent Dan Rookwood a picture yesterday and was pulled in by his boss this morning and given a little talking to about overuse of the internet. \"Someone squealed to her about it. I'm not happy, as I keep having to check over my shoulder before having a quick squint at the game. What do they expect us to do if they don't give us enough work?\" Resign, Matthew, she sounds like a total despot. 8th over: Sri Lanka 26-1 Jayasuriya hits a fine drive back past Collins on the off side for four. \"Gordon Gibbs should note that six of the eight cabs that can be found at any time south of the river have been hijacked,\" claims Pierre Moon. \"The cabbie/Elton John fan had probably just bundled the real cabbie out of the door and was off to spend the ludicrous amounts of money that had been made circling around Sloane Square and the City. The other two cabbies that venture south without a fuss are the best two cabbies in the history of cabbing.\" 9th over: Sri Lanka 30-1 Jayasuriya drives down the pitch again but has to settle for three this time. He's beginning to get his chops up. Dillon's final delivery clatters Tillakaratne about the head. I'd just like to point out that I've amended the 7th over to accuse Matthew Smith's boss of being a despot. 10th over: Sri Lanka 36-1 A lovely delivery from Collins nips back off the seam, finds Jayasuriya's inside edge and ... misses the stumps and sails away past deep fine leg for four. Lucky \"Fred Housego may be the only famous cabbie, but what the hell is he famous for?\" asks Ben Hendy, who clearly never watched the final of Mastermind in 1980. 11th over: Sri Lanka 41-1 First boundary for Tillakaratne, who drives Dillon back down the pitch through long off. \"My boss has fecked up the BACS and I ain't been paid today,\" moans Neil Apter, \"so a weekend of woe is mine.\" Go and kick off, Neil, that's outrageous. Banging your fist repeatedly on the desk should get people up and about their business. 12th over: Sri Lanka 48-1 Tillakaratne hasn't been the steadiest, but he's warming up. He pounces on a slower, shorter Collins delivery outside off stump and cracks it away to the square leg boundary. \"Matthew Smith's boss is an evil tyrant,\" writes Andrea Lowe. \"My IT department came round yesterday, made a note of my ip address and then went away again. That doesn't bode well, does it?\" No, although we're all getting RSI from repeatedly typing your name out, Andrea, so every cloud and all that. 13th over: Sri Lanka 52-1 Drakes on for Dillon. Jayasuriya is lucky here not once but twice. He sends a weak lob just short of gully, then finds a thin edge which is nearly snaffled by Jacobs but bounds away for four. \"While I agree that Matthew Smith's boss sounds like a bit of a fascist, I believe the focus of your derision should be the squealer,\" writes Alexander Egerton, quite reasonably, before spoiling the effect somewhat by exclaiming: \"What a twat!\" 14th over: Sri Lanka 54-1 A tight one from Collins. Number of readers mentioning famous cabbies and classic 1976 movie in same email = 23. 15th over: Sri Lanka 54-1 The first maiden of the day as Drakes and Tillakaratne enjoy a stand-off. \"What about Brett Anderson from Suede's dad?\" asks Jon Horsley. \"He's a cabbie one step removed from fame. And he'll happily give you a rendition of Animal Nitrate, if you ask. Probably.\" 16th over: Sri Lanka 60-1 Carl Hooper brings himself on for Collins. The crowd are \"entertained\" with some singles nudged to the mid wicket, as well as a couple of wides. Drinks! Which gives you time to look at this: \"My name is George Kokkotos. I am a taxi driver in Greece. Not an ordinary taxi driver. I am the Best Taxi Driver in Greece.\" I can't thank Matthew Britton enough. 17th over: Sri Lanka 62-1 The 50 partnership is up as Jayasuriya lifts a single over the slips to a space at gully. \"I believe Noddy also drove a taxi,\" writes Andi Thomas. \"Quite reasonable, too, at sixpence an adventure.\" 18th over: Sri Lanka 68-1 Tillakaratne sweeps a boundary through very very very fine leg. Then runs a smart single after padding the ball into a gap in the covers. \"What about Gerald Graham, the cabbie that Dennis Wise attacked?\" asks Nathan Byers, scraping the barrel. 19th over: Sri Lanka 71-1 Both teams are making hard work of this. It's tedious, in fact. There's slightly better news on Neil Apter's wage front. \"As I'm sure your caring readers will be gratified to note, my boss has agreed to refund any charges for unpaid rent etc. and given me a hundred quid for the weekend.\" Ah, the merits of sweeping all the things off your boss's desk and screaming thinly-veiled threats in their faces. 20th over: Sri Lanka 79-1 From an entertainment point of view this is better, from the West Indies point of view it is not. Hooper bowls a loose over, Jayasuriya picking away at him before the final indignity: a short, wide delivery is swept away through fine leg for four. \"How about Joe le Taxi by Vanessa Paradis?\" asks Shaun Blackwell, inserting a worm into my ear. 21st over: Sri Lanka 81-1 Another tight one from Drakes. All I can think of is bad Euro-pop. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 87-1 Hinds on. Jayasuriya turns him round the leg side two runs. And again. He's on 45 now, Tillekaratne on 32. Number of people to mention Leslie Grantham in relation to the taxi driver riff = 11. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 91-1 Tillekaratne drives through mid wicket for two, with some nifty fielding from Powell saving a boundary. I'm flagging here, so it's just as well that Sean Ingle will be taking over from the 26th over. WICKET: Sri Lanka 96-2 Tillekaratne b Hinds 36 Jayasuriya brings up his half century by stroking a ball through mid wicket. Then his partner plays all round a Hinds dellivery which pitches slightly on the offside but quickly straightens up. 24th over: Sri Lanka 97-2 Aravinda de Silva comes in and he's immediately off the mark. Matthew Britton points us to some testimonials for George the Best Taxi Driver in Greece, with particular reference to David Dutton from Lancashire's dynamic short story. 25th over: Sri Lanka 103-2 De Silva brings up the hundred with a lovely cover drive. Shot of the innings so far. HYPOCRITICAL BOSS ALERT!!!! \"In response to your readers' concerns over monitoring of internet usage,\" writes David Foote, \"we have been closely monitoring our esteemed team leader's usage of your on-line cricket commentary, for every game so far played in the World Cup. Please could you pass the message on to him - a Mr Will Brownlee - that the server warning which was sent round this morning was directed at him, plus his colleagues would quite like him to set a better example given the disapproving looks we get when taking the occasional glance at the England scores.\" No problem, David, always glad to uncover a member of management swinging the lead. Anyway, I'm off. See you in the next innings. 26th over: Sri Lanka 111-2 Good afternoon everyone, Sean Ingle here. After a lie in of Moses-in-the-wilderness proportions this morning, my brain - like Sri Lanka's batting - is struggling to find itself. Still, Da Silva, usually a diffident starter at best, is doing his best to shake off those early cobwebs, chasing Hinds through mid on for four. 27th over: WICKET! Da Silva run out (Chanderpaul) for 13 It all looks so easy for Da Silva who guides a exquisitely-timed drive through the covers for what looks like an easy three. But wait one ruddy second. Jarasuriya - who's not running to the danger end - decides to stick with two, leaving Da Silva left out to dry. Chanderpaul hits the stumps, and - after a few choice words with his captain - Da Silva heads back to the pavillion. 28th over: Sri Lanka 122-3 Usually when a wicket falls, steadiness-in-the-batting ensues. Not here: the running between the wickets maybe increasingly haphazard but Sri Lanka manage nine runs comes from the over - the most expensive so far. \"Revolution!\" says Matthew Shention, before brazenly adding the following link 29th over: Sri Lanka 123-3 Dillon returns to the attack and immediately acts like a cricketing gauze, stemming the flow of runs. \"On the subject of famous cabbies, former Reading FC boss Terry Bullivant (1997-1998), used to ply his trade as a cabbie between playing and coaching,\" says Adam Aldridge. \"He famously quipped he could always go back to cabbying if his managerial career hit the rocks. He promptly got us relegated and himself the elbow within eight months. He is currently driving haphazardly around the Selhurst area of South London.\" Can't see him picking up much money round there, Adam, that area's a dump (and I'm from Luton so I know one when I see one). 30th over: Sri Lanka 126-3 Another change in the the bowling, Chris Gayle coming on to essay his twirlers. He's not a regular frontline bowler, so you'd expect the Sri Lankans to go at him. They haven't managed to do it yet though. \"Many of your desktop followers may have disappeared,\" reckons a distraught Rory Jawani. \"At around 12.45 a major cable in the City imploded causing a power cut between Mansion House and Monument. Having been told at 2pm that we could go home, the power was miraculously restored at 20 minutes later. Now I'm stuck here having not left immediately (and, might I add, due to be splitting with the missus ETA 5.30 pm) after two pints and feeling distinctly shaky, probably until 5pm. Booooo!\" 31st over: Sri Lanka 127-3 Like a fat Midwestern man who travels down to Las Vegas and strikes gold on the slot machines, Jarasuriya is a lucky, lucky man. He clearly gloves a Dillon delivery to Jacobs, but the umpire - like Ian Paisley in his prime -says no, no, no! Incidentally, hats off to my colleague Dan Rookwood, who has just brought me some Minestrone soup for lunch. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 130-3 This match is currently slower than the erection section of a tacky 80s disco. The Sri Lankans aren't really on fire at the moment. Drinks. \"Did you know that St Rita is the Patron Saint of people in dire distress,\" says Richard Micallef. \"Could you please send me the postal address of the England cricket team so that I can send out a few holy pictures of her for the England players. It really works. My mum won ten quid at the bingo with one of these pictures in her pocket last Sunday.\" Hmm. Next you'll be sending me chain letters, Richard... WICKET: Jayawardene c Powell b Hooper 9 Jayawardene's shocker of a World Cup continues: he's bamboozled by Hooper's turn, flicks it round the corner, and Powell takes an easy catch. Sri Lanka are now 132-4. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 133-4 Russel Arnold nearly joins Jayawardene in the pavillion - he survives a very confident first-ball lbw appeal. \"Famous cabby No47: Jeoffrey/Geoffrey of Rainbow fame,\" says Dominic Smith. \"After he spent all the cash he made riding on the backs of the clearly-far-more-talented Bungle, Zippy and George, he's had to turn his hand to mini-cabbing to keep the wolf from the door. 34th over: Sri Lanka 137-4 The boundaries have completely dried up. As a result, Jarasuriya, who's now on 65, and Arnold, who's on 3 are happy to scrounge for singles. \"Terry Bullivant in the Selhurst area? That's more like it!\" says Gordon Gibbs. \"When he was manager at Reading, did he wear a cowboy hat with his trackie? Selhurst to Streatham, that would make sense. Terry bloody Bullivant, eh? Didn't he have a spell managing Barnet? Poor bloke looked like he'd totally lost the plot last night...sad, what can happen to ex-pro's, eh?\" Indeed, Gordon. Indeed. 35th over: Sri Lanka 139-4 Good over from Hooper, just two runs from it. The West Indies need to bowl 16 overs in an hour to avoid losing overs when they bat. Good news for Sri Lanka. Bad news for my increasingly painful fingers. WICKET! Jarasuriya c Chanderpaul b Gayle 65 It gets worse for Sri Lanka! Their captain tries to slog Gayle to the boundary, doesn't connect properly, and Chanderpaul snags a simple catch in the deep. They're in deep, deep trouble now at 140-5. 36th over: Sri Lanka 141-5 The Sri Lankan run rate has now dropped to 3.92, the boundaries have dried up, and their batsmen are are looking shaky. All in all, it's not looking good. More of your famous taxi drivers. \"Mickey Hazard, ex-Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea, is now a taxi driver and probably a very good one too!\" reckons an enthusiastic Jonathan Pughe. 37th over: Sri Lanka 146-5 That's better. Arnold is trying to establish some authority out there: his push for two followed by a quick single keeps the scoreboard ticking along. 38th over: Sri Lanka 154-5 Now Sangakkara gets in on the act. A slashing, bashing cut gains pace of the ground earns Sri Lanka their first boundary for a while. Incidentally, your emails seem to have dried up: I'm going to be in here till 9pm (the Guardian Unlimited graveyard shift), so God knows I need your help. 39th and 40th over: Sri Lanka 164-5 Technical problems. Apologies. You haven't missed much though. \"Afternoon, Sean,\" says Andrea Lowe. \"I squealed when I saw the phrase 'hats off' in your commentary. What have you done to me?\" I think it's more a question of what the lunchtime trip to the pub has done to you, Andrea. \"I'm not proud of having made such a girly noise (although this isn't because I'm really a man) and my boss is most unimpressed that I'm 'following the cricket again, aren't you?' she adds. \"Am still contemplating running away to Athens to ask George, the Best Taxi Driver in Greece, to marry me. After all, it can only be a matter of time before my employers acknowledge the fact that I do no work and are forced to sack me.\" 41st over: Sri Lanka 168-5 Mervyn Dillion finishes a fiesty spell with well-deserved figures of 10-0-30-1.Sri Lanka are still plodding along like a village policeman in some 1950s BBC drama. \"If Sri Lanka win this, New Zealand will quite likely become the first cricketing victims of Osama Bin Laden, given that they forfeited to Kenya due to terrorist activities there last year,\" reckons the strangely monikered Tan Copsey. \"Can this really be a coincidence, what with the unexplained explosion in Karachi early last year. In the interests of peace and justice (and the NZ cricket team) it is only right that the Windies should win this one.\" I'm supporting them too, Tan. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 175-5 It's not pretty, but it is effective. A jab here, a punch there keeps the scoreboard running over. \"I know he's not a cabbie, but on the spectacular falls from success theme, did you know that former Forest and England superstar Neil Webb is now a postman?\" says Katrina Smith. No, I did not, Katrina. Anyone else know whether Webby's since found love after splitting from Shelley? WICKET! Sangakkara out for 26 c Lara b Drakes Every time the Sri Lankans go for their shots they get out! With the last ball of the 43rd over, Sangakkara holes out, and the Windies can now set about the tail. To your emails: \"Can you please thank Rory Jiwani (from over 30) for advising us of the imminent split between him and his girlfriend and that I'll be happy to pass on the news to our other Uni mates,\" says a grateful James Dodge. While there's thanking to be done, cheers to Kate Carter for informing me that it's International RSI awareness day today - a subject Dan and myself know a little too much about... 44th over: Sri Lanka 184-6 Like a battered and bruised boxer going into the final round, the Sri Lankans are trying to dig in, trying to offer some resistance. But it's not looking good. Arnold has 19 off 31 balls, Vaas two off eight. At this point, there best chance is the night. \"The planned taxi driver revolution, code named (t)axis of evil, has now been suspended due to excessive Guardian hits,\" says Matthew Shenton, who adds this link for your perusal. 45th and 46th over: Sri Lanka 193-6 Hmm. I've just lost an over somewhere. Where did that go [scratches head unprofessionally]. Don't worry, you're not missing much: lots of prodding from the Sri Lankans, until - bam! - Arnold lofts one over midwicket for a boundary. \"Mike Hooper, ginger ex-Newcastle and Liverpool 'goalie' is now a bouncer at a rather unglamourous pub in Durham,\" says a rather unkind Russ McCourt. \"It serves him right for being largely rubbish at keeping goal.\" 47th over: Sri Lanka 197-6 Four singles off yet another uneventful over. At the moment this match has all the atmosphere of a wake. \"Not got much to say, but thanks for the training advice the other week,\" says Abu Berat. \"I pretty much knew everything you mentioned but it doesn't hurt to be reminded. I reckon you'll be on your own for the graveyard slot, it's Friday afternoon after all. Oh, and by the way any tips on how to heal badly burnt fingers (stupid saucepan).\" My Mum swears by the essential oil of lavender, Abu. 48th over: Sri Lanka 201-6 At last! The 200 comes up and the crowd clap and holler like Americans off to war. The noise seems to giddy-up the horse-teethed Vaas, however, as he smashes one over midwicket for a boundary. \"After an hour of racking my proverbials I still can't come up with a taxi driver story, but I did once see Brian Jacks (of Superstars fame) ten-pin bowling in Bexleyheath,\" says Jonathan Plunkett. \"He still looked orange, even though the show hadn't been on the telly for 10 years even then. I wondered if any of your other readers had seen former Superstars at play. Lynn Davies, for instance?\" Has it come to this, Jonathan? 49th over: Sri Lanka 213-6 Alleluia! It's taken 48 over for them to get there, but at last Sri Lanka are displaying the attacking verve they're capable off. Gayle goes for 12 off his final over as Vaas (27) and Arnold (22) tuck in. \"Can you tell all the people checking out the links that you keep showing to stop visiting them for a second or two,\" asks Kristian Petterson. \"They're overloading the sites and I've not seen any of them yet (apologies for sounding so whiny - it's almost the weekend so i'm feeling a bit childish)...!\" 50th over: Sri Lanka 228-6 That's it. It's over. Nearly four hours of opera-like tedium ends with a flourish: no balls, wides, two boundaries and a few singles. My colleague Scott Murray will be back in about 45 minutes with West Indies innings - join him then. Cheers, Sean."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
