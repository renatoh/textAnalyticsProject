If Brighton return to the Second Division, they will do the same. Both sides will feel they should have won. Martijn Reuser's 30-yard firecracker five minutes from time rescued a point for Ipswich, one that at times in the second half they barely deserved. It means they have lost only twice since early December but, perhaps more importantly, they have won only three of their last nine games. \"It is frustrating but I talk about frustration too often,\" said the Ipswich manager Joe Royle. \"I'm trying to think of another word to use, maybe a different f-word.\" The first half provided ample opportunity for Ipswich to seal the victory. \"It is quite typical of us,\" said Royle. \"We should have been out of sight; we had the chances to win two or three times over.\" Matt Holland was the most profligate. He fired six shots at the Brighton goal in the first period but only once stretched Dave Beasant. Darren Bent blazed a penalty over the bar between Brighton's goals. Having weathered the early Ipswich storm, Brighton fell behind in a cruel manner. The captain Danny Cullip attempted to help an innocuous through-ball back to Beasant but got only the lightest of touches, allowing Marcus Bent to capitalise. \"People make mistakes,\" said Steve Coppell, \"and we have a no-blame policy.\" The rollicking Cullip dished out to the blameless Beasant cast doubts over whether the players always adhere to that policy. Brighton improved after the interval and their equaliser was deserved. Tony Rougier's header cannoned off the bar and hit Andy Marshall on the back before crossing the line. It was a clear own-goal, though Rougier may try to claim it. \"He's 15 stone; just try and take it away from him,\" joked Coppell. Ipswich were missing Hermann Hreidarsson, who has had interest from Charlton but looks set to join Portsmouth at the end of the season after Harry Redknapp tabled a \u00a31.5m bid, and Darren Ambrose, the subject of interest from Newcastle. Brighton's second goal exposed the gap that Hreidarsson's departure might leave. Paul Brooker dragged three defenders out of the game and his cross was turned in by Rougier, playing his final game on loan before returning to Reading. It looked to have sealed an unlikely victory until Reuser struck. Man of the match : Paul Brooker (Brighton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
