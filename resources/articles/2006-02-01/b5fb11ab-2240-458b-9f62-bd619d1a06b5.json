I'd been snapped by a speed camera doing 42mph in a 30mph zone - three points and \u00a360. I knew immediately which loathsome yellow-backed flasher it was as well - the one at the bottom of our hill, hidden by trees and lurking in the undergrowth like some menacing hitchhiker. It had got me before, and considering I was driving Nissan's whippet-quick Murano, I was quite relieved it was only 42mph. Temptation is a terrible thing and sitting at the wheel of the super-sexy SUV crossover (marketing speak for a vehicle that looks like a 4X4 but handles like a sportscar) it would have taken a bigger man than me to resist the lure of its 3.5-litre engine - the same powerplant that drives Nissan's iconic 350Z sports car. So I suppose it was inevitable... There are now about 6,000 speed cameras in use around Britain, and the number of speeding offences is rising all the time - it's estimated they'll soon pass the two million per year mark - generating, after costs, a profit of at least \u00a320m a year for the treasury. But don't despair. There are things the speed-savvy motorist can do to deal with these relentless roadside daleks which don't involve sawing them down, crashing into them, covering them with cardboard boxes, shooting them in the face with a shotgun or smashing them with tyre irons... as some of the motoring community's more vociferous opponents have done in the past. The first is to invest in an on-board detector which is effective and legal but expensive (the Origin Blue I, for instance, will set you back \u00a3379 - or 6.3 speeding tickets). The second is to spray your number plate with a clear, highly reflective product, such as Flashtec, which causes your number plate to be unreadable under flash photography. It's cheap (0.5 speeding tickets) and, perhaps surprisingly, still legal. The third, which is totally free, is of course, to drive more slowly. But this option seems to be the one we find hardest. In many ways, it was appropriate that I should be snapped in the Murano. Its double-take looks mean it's not going to appeal to the camera shy. With its wraparound chrome grille, sleek chiselled lines and kerb grinding alloy wheels, the Nissan seems to have been built with nothing more rugged in mind than a red carpet. Ask our photographer, he had to be towed from the mud in Epping Forest just after the picture above was taken. Other than providing regular sustenance for speed cameras, the Murano also comes with several internal TV screens. Two pulldown DVDs will keep back-seat passengers happy, while in the front, a hi-tech reversing camera will sooth even the most irate driver. The simple act of parallel parking seems to be rocket fuel for a hundred domestic disputes (R should stand for Rage not Reverse), but by beaming the view from a camera placed above the rear bumper on to a screen in the dashboard, the Murano driver will never again have to estimate how big 12 inches really is. martin.love@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
