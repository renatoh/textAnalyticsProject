The former world No 1, always a voice of reason whenever the odd naysayer raises his head to discuss equal prize money or other occasionally contentious issues, has been putting his name and number out there in the past couple of weeks, almost like a teenager begging for a date. And like a teenager, he has had to deal with more than his share of rejection. Ashleigh Barty, the recently crowned French Open champion who is already down to play women\u2019s doubles as well as singles, said she could not manage three events, a decision she described as one of the hardest she has ever had to make. And France\u2019s Kristina Mladenovic, who won the mixed title at Wimbledon in 2013, also politely declined for similar reasons. The Czech Barbora Strycova and Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium are among those who took to social media to offer their services, while the Australian Casey Dellacqua, who partnered Barty to three grand slam doubles finals, said she would consider coming out of retirement if Murray should come knocking. Murray has yet to decide, but just as he might have been despairing that he might not find an ideal partner, up stepped a rather unlikely possibility: Serena Williams. \u201cI\u2019m available,\u201d the 23-times grand slam singles champion said on Saturday, her tongue perhaps in cheek. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better now, so I\u2019m definitely available.\u201d Williams turns 38 in September and goes into Wimbledon without a warm-up event under her belt, the effect of a lingering knee injury leaving her unable to practise on grass until the start of last week. Whether her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, would countenance a decision to play mixed in addition to her singles is debatable and, as Williams said, her fitness is her first priority as she chases her 24th major title, a win that would equal the all-time record of the Australian Margaret Court. \u201cLet\u2019s see how my knee\u2019s going,\u201d said Williams, who won the mixed title in 1998 with Max Mirnyi of Belarus. \u201cI\u2019m finally doing good. I don\u2019t want to, like, go back.\u201d Having won the title at the Fever-Tree Championships on his return alongside Feliciano L\u00f3pez, Murray will partner Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France \u2013 winner of all four grand slam men\u2019s doubles titles \u2013 in the men\u2019s event. The possibility of a partnership with Williams, though, clearly piqued his interest. \u201cShe\u2019s arguably the best player ever,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt would be a pretty solid partner.\u201d Murray has until 11am on Wednesday to enter and there is no question that his return to the Tour has given the doubles event far more attention than usual. The best-of-five-set format \u2013 Wimbledon is the only one of the grand slams not to play best of three sets in the men\u2019s doubles \u2013 means very few top singles players feel they can compete in both events. \u201cI think when the top singles players are involved in the doubles, it does draw a little bit more attention to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I think will be a positive thing for tennis, if more guys were playing doubles. \u201cBut here it\u2019s difficult because of the format, the best-of-five sets. For me, even [though] I\u2019m playing doubles here, it\u2019s even a consideration if I\u2019m going to play mixed, as well. I would never expect a top singles player to enter the doubles here because playing potentially 10 sets in one day is just too much. That\u2019s something that maybe would be worth looking at, to give more value to the doubles event, to get more of the top singles players playing, is to reduce the length of the matches a bit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
