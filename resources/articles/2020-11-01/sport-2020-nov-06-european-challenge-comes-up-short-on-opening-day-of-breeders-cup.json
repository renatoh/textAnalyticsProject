Battleground finished strongly from well off the pace but was still three lengths adrift of Mike Maker\u2019s Fire At Will in the Juvenile Turf, while Jessica Harrington\u2019s Cadillac finished fourth in the same race. Mother Earth, meanwhile, ran a similar race to Battleground\u2019s behind the easy winner Aunt Pearl in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf, with Miss Amulet, from Ken Condon\u2019s stable in Ireland, back in third. Bookmakers saw no reason to alter Battleground\u2019s price for next year\u2019s 2,000 Guineas and he remains the 10-1 joint-favourite for the Classic with his stable companion, St Mark\u2019s Basilica. Mother Earth remains a 20-1 chance for the 1,000 Guineas. It was a similar story of hitting the bar in the Juvenile Turf Sprint, where Ubettabelieveit, trained in Yorkshire by Nigel Tinkler, stayed on after a slow start to finish third, but the easy winner Golden Pal is a name to note for British backers as his trainer, Wesley Ward, is a regular at Royal Ascot and will consider a run in either the King\u2019s Stand Stakes or the Commonwealth Cup next June. Golden Pal recorded an explosive success, soon in front against the rail and then bursting clear in the stretch before being closed down in the final strides. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful colt to train,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI\u2019ve had him since September of his yearling year, right from the sale here [at Keeneland]. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to take a horse like that and then just watch him emerge, every month that goes by, he\u2019s like a young kid and you could tell he was an athlete. And then as we go through, as time goes on, the months go on, you could just see him just building stronger and stronger and really mentally coming together. \u201cIt would be like a young quarterback that\u2019s kind of a cocky young guy and then as we finally get to the end of the season, he\u2019s really, really come together mentally. He\u2019s just really a cool guy to be around.\u201d Golden Pal was so fast through the early part of the race from a wide draw in stall 14 that the King\u2019s Stand Stakes, over five furlongs, looks a more likely target than the Commonwealth Cup, which is restricted to three-year-olds but run over six furlongs. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut him down now,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThat was always the plan. We\u2019re going to finish the year off here and bring him back just after Christmas kind of start him back nice and easy and have him ready to go. \u201cThey usually have a stakes here opening day for straight three-year-olds and that will usually tell us if we need another one before we get to Ascot, or that will be it until we get to Ascot and we\u2019ll probably go for the King\u2019s Stand. He was getting a little late there the last part, so he\u2019s a lot better at five than six, but he\u2019s just got such quality that he was able to sustain that extra 16th of a mile.\u201d On the dirt, Essential Quality was an impressive winner of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile for the US arm of the Godolphin operation. Brad Cox\u2019s colt powered past Jackie\u2019s Warrior, the favourite, and Dreamer\u2019s Disease just as the pair seemed set for a duel down the stretch, staying on strongly to suggest that the Kentucky Derby is a realistic target. A first-day blank was disappointing for the travelling team but there are several big names on the card at Keeneland on Saturday, when nine races will make up the major afternoon at the meeting. Kameko, the 2,000 Guineas winner, is likely to start favourite for the Mile, while Magical, Tarnawa and Mogul lead a strong European challenge for the Turf. Yorkshire could also be among the winners in Kentucky, as Glass Slippers, a Group One-winning sprinter from Kevin Ryan\u2019s yard near Malton, is in the field for the Turf Sprint against a strong line-up of US-trained sprinters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
