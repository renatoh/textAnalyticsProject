Chris looks really cool \u2013 tall and confident, with silver hair \u2013 and so is Edie. I decided to do a day-in-the-life project with them. He works in a call centre, and I spent two months going to his house every week on his day off. Chris made sure to wear the same outfit and Edie would wait at the window for me. I followed them around Sunderland as they did what they would normally do. They went for a walk along the sea, to the shop or the arcade, to the cafe. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to that cafe my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where I used to take dates.\u201d At the shop, he would usually tie Edie up outside. One day he said: \u201cOK, she knows you now. This time I\u2019m going to give you the lead.\u201d I\u2019m tall and thin, and when he came out, he was laughing. \u201cYou look like two whippets together,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve always had cats, but Edie made me want to get a dog. Like almost all of the pictures in the series, this shot was of just a moment. What makes it for me is that it is such a typically British seaside arcade. It is an environment I know well. I\u2019ve long lived in Whitley Bay, in the north of England. And I spent my whole childhood going to stay at my grandmother\u2019s in Aberdeen. She lived on the 18th floor of a tower block \u2013 you could see the sea from it. My mother would take us to the seaside cafes she ate at when she was young. My brother and I would have knickerbocker glories, then go to the arcades. I think that is why ice-cream vans, chintzy rollercoasters, inflatables, vintage cars \u2013 these are always things that catch my eye now. This wasn\u2019t the first shoot I\u2019d done with Chris. He\u2019s been in some of my ad campaigns. On the very first one we did, the models thought he was a model too, because of the way he conducts himself. It was a betting advertising campaign, and the creative director wanted British gangster-movie types. \u201cThey need confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to know what they\u2019re doing. We might not get that from the model agency.\u201d When I messaged Chris he said: \u201cI\u2019m a member of that betting agency. I play poker every day.\u201d I guess the slot machines are an extension of his love of betting. Chris doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend at the moment. He\u2019s got Edie now, and says: \u201cI don\u2019t even need a girl.\u201d She has brought happiness back into his life. At one point, I thought he might be in a relationship with his next-door neighbour Julie. She is his best friend and has two grey whippets. Before I did this project, I\u2019d shot the three dogs together once, and when I was going to Chris\u2019s house every week, Julie\u2019s whippets would also always be at the window. I think Julie was quite jealous. She said: \u201cWhy not my dogs?\u201d Chris told her it was because the project is called One Man and His Dog, not One Woman and Two Dogs. I only staged one picture, of a framed photograph of Chris and Edie on the sideboard. He didn\u2019t have a picture of them in his house, and I thought he should. So I went on his Facebook page to look for a suitable photograph, then printed it out and framed it. I brought it round and said: \u201cCan we put it here?\u201d Chris said: \u201cGarrod, that will stay there for ever now.\u201d When the project was finished, I told Chris that I thought we had got enough He said: \u201cDon\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t actually know what I\u2019ll do with my day off now.\u201d I\u2019ve been thinking about making a film version of the project. When I messaged him about it, he was like: \u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019ve still got the same clothes.\u201d \u2022 Garrod Kirkwood is a finalist in the Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize.
