It ain't me, babe", "bodyText": "Shock news from the world of sugar coatings: according to a survey, the dismal \"babe\" has usurped \"darling\" as the pet name for paramours. A third of Britons are said to use babe or baby; one in eight favour love or lovely; a mere 10th resort to darling; while sweetie, sweetheart and gorgeous bring up the rear. Other top 10 handles in a poll of presumed English speakers include \"cuddles\", \"pudding\" and \u2013 I feel I am allowed a ye gods here \u2013 \"stinky\". This is all rather confusing, as not six months ago the same publication to announce these findings reported babe to be women's most detested monicker, along with the positively paedo \"baby girl\" and \"baby doll\", and not so delectable \"pudding\" and \"pumpkin\". Sweetcheeks, snookums and muffin were happily also out. However, the egotistical \"gorgeous\", \"beautiful\" and \"lovely\" were deemed socially acceptable. Or perhaps it is not in the least confusing for, as marriage itself teaches us, something that is familiar may also be despised. In this context, one notes that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's pet names for one another are rumoured to be Babykins and Big Willie. There is something resolutely stomach-turning about the moment when such epithets make the transition from pillow to public. Recently I encountered a woman who referred to her husband as Snuggle Muffin loudly, stridently and unnecessarily possessively. Later she forcibly removed him from his seat between two women in a manner that led one to conclude it might be simpler to have the word \"Mine\" tattooed on his forehead. Many right-thinking individuals will view the ascendency of babe, in particular, with consternation. Apparently it took flight, in a more snarling context, with Bob Dylan (Don't Think Twice, It Ain't Me Babe), lately gaining currency as banal sadist Christian Grey's sign-off in Shades of What Have You. Sloppy, Americanised, fundamentally infantilising \u2013 being addressed in such terms surely constitutes a punching offence, no safe word allowed. It is testament to society's confusion of the roles of lover, child and sibling, where the young are prematurely sexualised, adults irredeemably infantilised. Still, I confess, I have an issue even being addressed by my own name. It feels reprimanding, American, while, in an erotic context, a tad too \"Top marks to me for remembering it\". Were I Gallic I would want a vous rather than a tu relationship, and operate a policy that \"Betts\" is reserved for friends, \"darling\" for thespians, and \"sweetheart\" for my father. Pet names and diminutives invariably prove testing. Muriel Schulz's 1975 essay The Semantic Derogation of Women charts the way in which female designations inevitably descend into sexual slurs, whether originating as neutral (those indicating kinship, say) or endearments (such as nymph, doll, peach). And then, of course, there is the ever vexing issue of the politically modish term with which to refer to one's significant other. The only individuals who appear entirely happy with husband and wife are gay men and lesbians for whom it serves as a convenient abbreviation for: \"Fuck you, society at large, for not letting me have one.\" \"Partner\" is rather too corporate via the OK Corral. A friend tells me that she has resorted to the appositional \"This is X, my person\", or Glaswegian \"This is my man/woman\" \u2013 the latter striking me as a tad Neanderthal 70s in the manner of, \"This is my luh-ver\". That said, I am so emotionally stunted that I was wont to refer to said individual/s with the over-literal Person I am Currently Sleeping With, on the grounds that anything else would prove impertinent on everybody's part. I am, needless to add, Currently Single. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 February 2013. It originally spelled OK Corral as OK Coral. This has now been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
