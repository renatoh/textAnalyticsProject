Bernhard Langer and Ian Woosnam were probably the two most outstanding captains in Ryder Cup history - bar perhaps Ben Hogan in 1967 when he took the decision to drop the then world's greatest golfer, Arnold Palmer. Woosnam and Langer were wonderful captains with very different styles; one a gregarious outgoing personality, the other more of an introvert, but both worked. The way Woosnam picked Darren Clarke after all he had been through on the first day at the K Club but then had the foresight to rest him after the morning's games, that was something that came straight from the Welshman. Little decisions like that contributed to the landslide victory. A successful captain has to have respect. Langer was a major champion; Woosnam was a major champion; Nick Faldo is a six-time major champion. You couldn't put someone in there who has achieved less than the 12 players. But it's about more than that. Woosnam, Langer and Faldo all achieved their success in an individual game. At the Ryder Cup they have to unite a team and Langer and Woosnam were extremely efficient at doing that. It was Tony Jacklin who changed the captain's role. Our team took a fair thumping in 1979 and 1981 and Jacklin's aim in 1983 was to get them to believe in themselves. He wanted the players to feel equal in status to the Americans, so suddenly there were flights on Concorde and a few cashmere sweaters and Europe lost by a point in Florida. Jacklin set a different standard and the role gained an awful lot more importance. At the end of the day, the players hit the ball to win or lose the Ryder Cup but the captain's role is still pivotal. One of the most important areas is in his observation of the rookies. One or two might have a little fear in their eyes, which would be no surprise, and you have got to make sure you blood them at the right time in the competition. Choosing the pairings has certainly become easier this side of the Atlantic now Europe are playing rather than GB &amp; Ireland. Players from the same country gel well, the likes of Spain's Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal and Sergio Garc\u00eda, and the Swedish players also play well together. The real key for the captain is to know when to break a partnership if one player isn't playing well. I felt for Hal Sutton, the losing American captain in 2004. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were a good pairing. I would have done exactly the same thing with the world No1 and 2. You would have expected them to be able to put aside whatever differences they had but that didn't happen and it backfired. The fact is that the Americans always used to have the best players but the balance has swung to Europe, making things harder for the US captain. If you look at Tom Lehman's team for the K Club, yes he had the world No1 and 2, but the tail end was weak. That definitely influenced Paul Azinger this time. He saw Brett Wetterich and JJ Henry struggle in 2006 and made sure he had four captain's picks which was a very wise move. No Brian Barnes Played in six Ryder Cups between 1969 and 1979 A captain can lose you the Ryder Cup but it is the players who win one. Everything in life today is analysed to the nth degree, so the captain's choices of wildcards, pairings and strategies as well as their personality are not going to be any different. But as far as I am concerned a captain's position in the team is for services rendered over the years and no captain, not even in this day and age, has ever been able to make a player try any harder to win. The Ryder Cup is a matchplay, team event which happens once every 104 weeks. For the other 103 weeks you play as an individual. And the only time I felt conscious of playing as a team was when you were wearing your Ryder Cup blazers or when points went up on the board. The rest of the time the pressure was still on you as an individual. To sit down and have a captain try to gee you up to play better probably has the reverse effect. When I played in the Ryder Cup I was proud to play for GB&amp; Ireland and that made me play my damnedest. Pride in your performance was what mattered and if that produced a point that was all to the good because you helped the team. The captain's main role and all they can influence, in my opinion, is who plays with who and who complements each other. The home captain's role of setting up the course doesn't make that much difference these days. All of the players play on these types of courses regularly on the tour. But the captain does have to produce pairings who enjoy playing with each other to bring out the best of their playing partner. Part of the reason why I dovetailed so well with my partner Bernard Gallacher was that Bernie was a terrible driver of a golf ball: if I was going to hit the fairway nine times out of 10, he was going to miss it eight times out of 10. But because I was a powerful driver of the ball to get us close to the green, it meant we could take advantage of the fact he was a wonderful chipper. We complemented each other whether it was foursomes or fourballs. But you can only do that if you like the person you play with so the captain does need to get it right. I think Faldo may have made a mistake not having enough lieutenants. Seve Ballesteros tried to do it on his own and I wouldn't have been at all surprised to hear the players were pissed off with the captain up their backsides all the time watching and telling them what to do. They're some of the best players in the world, once you have made your decisions over the pairings leave them to get on with it. If all of a sudden the captain is trying to push things around you get tension in the team and individuals won't play particularly well. And as a captain you need information from all four matches because you can't be at all of them at once. You need to pick pairings for the afternoon matches so if one guy in a partnership is playing badly a captain needs to know so he goes and has a rest and goes on to the practice ground. There will always be the kudos of winning a Ryder Cup for the captain, and that is probably fit and proper because there is no doubt they are under the most pressure. It's easier playing than watching. Ask the Ryder Cup wives; they start the week with these beautiful manicured nails and end it with them bitten to the quick. Watching will be terrible for Faldo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
