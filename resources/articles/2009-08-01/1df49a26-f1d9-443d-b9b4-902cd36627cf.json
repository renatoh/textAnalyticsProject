The CBI survey reveals that of firms seeking new credit lines in the past three months, 27% said that availability had improved, while 10% said it had worsened. The resulting rounded balance of 18% is the first improvement in credit supply since the survey began in January. Bigger firms with more than 5,000 employees saw the strongest rise in credit availability, after much more difficult start of the year. However, the Access to Finance Survey showed that the cost of credit has continued to rise. Half of firms saw a rise in the cost of new credit over the past three months and one in five (21%) reported a rise of more than 100 basis points. Figures from the market also point to a recovery. Bond sales by European companies surged to an all-time high of $1.1tn in the first seven months of the year, beating the previous record set for the whole of 2007, according to Bloomberg. Companies flooded to the bond market because of the dearth of lending from banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, which are still writing down the value of their loan books. As the CBI survey suggests, top-rated companies were first to tap the credit markets. The biggest bond issue came from Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, which raised $15.8bn to fund its acquisition of U.S. biotechnology firm Genentech. Sportswear maker Adidas and ICAP, an inter-dealer broker, sold senior debt for the first time. According to the CBI, small and medium sized enterprises (SME) saw a moderate decline in the availability of existing credit lines (a balance of -12%) and expect a similar tightening over the next three months. While the supply of new credit improved slightly (+8%), firms predict it will remain flat in the coming three months. Some activity suggests the situation may be improving with recent deals including Italian mobile operator Wind and Virgin Media. \"If you have more confidence that the economy is stabilising and likely to improve, you accept more risk and seek more yield,\" Eyerman said. Richard Lambert, CBI director-general, said: \"Credit availability had been getting more difficult for many months, so today's results are positive news. The improvement in access to new credit will help many businesses struggling with the recession, and it is encouraging that its supply is expected to improve in the months ahead. \"Smaller and medium sized businesses are still facing challenging credit conditions and have fewer funding options open to them than big companies. We hope that over time their credit supply will improve.\" In another sign that conditions are easing, credit rating agencies have cut their default rate predictions. This will help businesses to borrow or re-finance, instead of being forced into insolvency. Top rated companies, which paid about 2 percentage points above central banks' base rates to borrow money two years ago, saw their average borrowing cost soar to almost 6 percentage points above the base rate after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. They are now at 2.4 percentage points. For the junk-rated companies, the costs skyrocketed to almost 18 percentage points in October \u2013 falling to 8.1 now, according to S&amp;P."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
