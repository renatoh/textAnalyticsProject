Jewell and Wigan added victory over Fulham in the Carling Cup on Tuesday night to the superb start they have made in the Nationwide League this season. Last season's Second Division champions lead the First Division by two points after winning seven and drawing one of their eight matches to date. They could make that eight out of nine this weekend when they travel to Highfield Road to play Coventry City. Yet Jewell feels that after his achievement getting Bradford to the Premiership nobody should be surprised by Wigan. He earned promotion with City in 1999 and then, more remarkably, managed to keep them in the top flight against considerable odds the following season - achievements he believes were not given the credit they might have been. \"If you look at my CV it's not bad but it's not for me to do that, nor do I write headlines and tell people to mention me with this job or that job,\" he says. \"As far as I'm concerned, I'm happy to do my job here but I never get carried away because I know what this game is like. \"In getting Bradford into the Premier League and staying in the Premier League, I feel Chris Hutchings [his assistant then and now] and I never got enough credit for it. But I can do nothing about that. \"We can only take care of the here and now and myself and Chris have been in this situation before. The experience of having done it before is a wonderful thing. There's nothing like it, so we're hoping we can do it again but there's a long, long way to go yet.\" Jewell walked out on Bradford after a fall-out with the then chairman Geoffrey Richmond, prior to an ill-fated spell at Sheffield Wednesday. Jewell, though, would now love nothing more than to emulate with Wigan his feat at Bradford and so finally dispel the doubts that have surrounded him over the years. \"I never doubted I could cut the grain again,\" he says. \"There are a lot of misconceptions that I was sacked at Bradford but that was not the case. I left because the chairman and I didn't see eye to eye. I went to Sheffield Wednesday and unfortunately it didn't work out there. There's managers who have tried it since and it hasn't worked out - and they're now in a different division to when I left. Jewell is guarded about Wigan's prospects because he knows just how quickly the situation could turn sour and so is urging fans not to get too giddy. \"I'm not one to get carried away because I believe that, once you start taking your foot off the gas, then this game bites you back. The players have done ever so well so far but we're only eight matches into the season. \"We deal with each and every game as it comes and, as boring as that sounds, that's the way it will always be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
