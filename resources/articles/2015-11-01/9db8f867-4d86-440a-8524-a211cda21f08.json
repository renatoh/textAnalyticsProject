Andy plays David Goffin in the first reverse singles, having not dropped a set against him in two previous encounters, as well as having examined his game in the third rubber of this tie as he and his elder sibling beat Belgium\u2019s No1 and his compatriot Steve Darcis 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. \u201cGood to get that one done in four sets,\u201d Andy said. \u201cBut I feel fine [for the Goffin singles match]. It\u2019s far from over. Even if I was to lose against Goffin, I think we have a very good chance in the fifth rubber [in which James Ward would probably replace Kyle Edmund against either Darcis or Ruben Bemelmens], whoever plays for them. \u201cI\u2019m not getting ahead of myself. I know how good a player Goffin is. You don\u2019t get to be ranked 16 in the world in today\u2019s game with the depth that there is if you\u2019re not pretty good at the game. I feel pretty relaxed. I\u2019m sure there will be nerves tomorrow. But I like being nervous. It helps me concentrate, it helps me give a little bit more effort. It might only be a couple of per cent, but it all makes a difference.\u201d As to any feelings of joy or celebration after a fraught battle over two hours and 49 minutes that secured Great Britain a 2-1 lead, he said: \u201cTo play in a Davis Cup final with your brother and to win a point for your country is obviously great. We may never get the chance to do that again, so we have to enjoy that.\u201d His brother, who contemplated retirement two years ago before relaunching his doubles career to great effect with John Peers before parting company with the Australian this month, was similarly moved by the occasion \u2013 so much so, he admitted, that nerves strangled his game at the start of the match. Having shared victories with his brother at Queen\u2019s Club in the quarter\u2011finals against France and at Glasgow\u2019s Emirates Arena in the semi\u2011finals against Australia, he also appreciated how special the achievement is, and how it will be further enhanced if the team win the cup for the first time in 79 years. Did they find it reassuring to be playing together? \u201cIt\u2019s probably more reassuring for me than it is for him,\u201d he replied to much laughter. Nonetheless, in garnering 10 of 11 points in the 2015 campaign, the Murrays could lay claim to being Britain\u2019s most successful sporting family in a long time. The team captain, Leon Smith, who has known both since childhood, said, \u201cThey did very, very well today. We will go away and make sure that Andy and whoever goes out for the second singles is absolutely ready.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
