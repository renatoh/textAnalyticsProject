It took Justin Rose, still reeling from last year\u2019s painful Masters play\u2011off defeat to Sergio Garc\u00eda, to overhear a conversation his young son Leo had at football training before an element of closure ensued. \u201cWhat he said did help me come to terms with it a little bit,\u201d Rose says. \u201cHe said to one of his friends at football that Sergio won it fair and square. So it was bit of a case of I shouldn\u2019t be beating myself up about it because he can see I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \u201cI just wonder if he\u2019d say the same about himself if he was in a similar position, because Leo is just ferociously competitive. It was interesting to hear him show some empathy, because when things don\u2019t go his way \u2013 especially at football \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he would show quite the same emotion.\u201d Rose\u2019s grace in defeat was striking. Not that the Englishman\u2019s praise of Garc\u00eda and a maiden major success meant coming second did not cause deep hurt. \u201cIt was really, really painful,\u201d Rose says. \u201cBut at the same time I had this overriding feeling that you cannot go through your whole career without a bit of heartache. You cannot be on leaderboards at big tournaments all the time and have things go your way all the time. \u201cI had been in contention in a few majors here and there but never really been right there at the death, other than when I won [the US Open] at Merion. So from my point of view, Olympic golf, US Open, those kind of moments had gone my way up until then. This was the first time it had gone against me and I know Sergio had suffered that many times. So it was just his time.\u201d Still, Rose can pinpoint how the outcome could have been to his benefit. He has made a career out of painting positive scenarios in his thoughts. In the rush to the first play\u2011off hole, Rose had no chance to accentuate a positive. \u201cWhen I found myself on the 18th tee again, I just didn\u2019t find a way to compose myself properly. I hadn\u2019t told myself: \u2018It\u2019s time to rejig the story now.\u2019 I felt it all happened so quick, and before I knew it I\u2019d hit it in the trees and it was done. \u201cThe other thing is I\u2019d worn sunglasses all day and I made the decision to take them off right before the play-off, because I didn\u2019t want to be over a putt with the sun going down thinking I\u2019m not feeling comfortable.\u201d Rose\u2019s recent form and impressive results sequence at the Masters render him a live candidate to go one step better on Sunday evening. When asked if experiences of a year ago make him more or less likely to don a Green Jacket before his career ends, the answer is emphatic. \u201cMore likely, definitely,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at how the runners-up have done in recent years. Adam Scott finished runner-up and went on to win. Jordan Spieth was runner-up the year before he won. When I go to Augusta I feel so good there. It hasn\u2019t dampened my enthusiasm for being there. I really love the place. \u201cWhen I went back for a visit last week I knew I was over it. Last summer was tough for me, there\u2019s no getting away from that. There was a bit of a hangover because I didn\u2019t want to play for the two weeks that I had off after the Masters last year. Then I made some changes to my swing after that, so it\u2019s difficult to say I didn\u2019t play well in the summer just because of what happened at Augusta. I was doing different things as well, but honestly, since then it\u2019s been such a small thought in my mind. \u201cThere was a minute, in the aftermath where it was hard, but I never woke up thinking: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve lost the Masters.\u2019 When I thought about it, I did feel like it was a shame. But I never woke up with a hole in my heart. I never felt like that. \u201cOne major is pretty great but I am at a stage in my career where I can really change my story quite a lot if I was able to win two, three or extra.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
