What else can he do?", "bodyText": "What a frightful pest Richard Ratcliffe is being \u2013 so thoughtless, cluttering up the lovely posh pavement outside the Iranian embassy in Knightsbridge, with his protest against his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s wrongful imprisonment in Iran, where she is serving a five-year sentence for espionage. Another view might be: what else is Ratcliffe supposed to do, when the right to protest is all he has left? Ratcliffe has joined his wife on a hunger strike, demanding, among other things, her immediate release. He\u2019s just spent the week stationed outside the embassy and plans to stay until at least this weekend, perhaps longer. Ratcliffe has been visited by family members and supporters, including SNP MPs and Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. One important person Ratcliffe didn\u2019t manage to see, even on Father\u2019s Day, was his young daughter, Gabrielle, who lives in Tehran with her grandparents in order to be able to visit her mum in prison. Lovely. While the Iranian ambassador, Hamid Baeidinejad, seems not without compassion for Ratcliffe, he has labelled the protest \u201cdisruptive\u201d, saying that it blocks the embassy entrance and that staff are being abused by supporters and filmed by the media\u2019s cameras. Baeidinejad has taken up the issue with the Foreign Office, claiming the protest is in breach of the part of the Vienna convention that protects the daily running of embassies. There are also reports that some diplomatic protection for the British embassy in Tehran has been removed in reprisal for the protest. So it\u2019s a highly charged and delicate situation, but, I ask again, what choice does Ratcliffe have? Zaghari-Ratcliffe is doomed without pressure maintained on her case, a pressure at least partly powered by public and media attention. Nor could the couple be blamed if they have lost faith in the system. Their plight was worsened by the intervention of an incompetent, self-serving buffoon, masquerading at the time as foreign secretary, who inaccurately blurted about Zaghari-Ratcliffe \u201cteaching journalism\u201d (she was on holiday), thus making the situation worse. Bravo, Boris Johnson, who\u2019s a tad busy right now, horse-fixing his way to becoming prime minister. Thank God there\u2019s the new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt! Oh hang on, Hunt is also busy right now \u2013 running against Johnson to be prime minister. In fact, the entire government has been hyper-focused on the leadership race, arguably at the expense of all other business. Maybe it\u2019s starting to become a little clearer why Ratcliffe decided that his only option was to starve himself on the pavement outside the Iranian embassy. Not because he enjoys attention, but because he and his wife and daughter need it. However inconvenient the embassy is finding the situation, depicting Ratcliffe as some kind of irresponsible, capricious protester would be unfair. Ratcliffe and Zaghari-Ratcliffe have diligently used all the correct channels, but this doesn\u2019t seem to have got them very far. These are the last-ditch efforts of a loving husband and father, the actions of a family man turning to protest in desperation. What horrors lurked in Nicky Campbell\u2019s teenage room? When presenter Nicky Campbell mess-shamed his 18-year-old daughter by tweeting a photo of her chaotic bedroom, it turned out that she\u2019d helped him photograph the worst bits. How did that exchange go, I wonder? \u201cDad, I think you missed the giant knotted ball of laddered opaque tights behind the scattered and trodden-on contents of my makeup bag.\u201d That young woman has a sense of humour, if not any floor space to walk upon. Nor was I surprised when other parents tweeted their own teen bedroom horrors. Many parents know what it\u2019s like \u2013 you pop your head around your teenager\u2019s door and it looks as though a bomb has gone off in the sorting room of a rundown charity shop. However, what was Campbell\u2019s teenage bedroom like? I\u2019ve got to admit that mine was an airless, goth-themed rat\u2019s nest \u2013 there were old apple cores under the bed that were probably mutating into what would later become a terrible virus. Even as an adult, I was so disorganised that I moved house with cutlery jammed into Wellington boots, while bras were transported hanging off the backs of kitchen chairs in full view of the new neighbours. So, while I sympathise with Pa Campbell, I have to factor in parental hypocrisy. On the rather slim chance that untidiness is genetic, what\u2019s his backstory? True love or just an Instagram story\u2026 who can tell any more? Apologies, I can\u2019t be long, I need to buy a hat. A big, flouncy wedding hat to celebrate (from a discreet distance) the nuptials of \u201cInstagram influencer\u201d Marissa Casey Fuchs (193,000 followers) and her intrepid groom-to-be, Gabriel Grossman. Intrepid because Grossman planned a surprise proposal, which would occur after a 48-hour multi-destination \u201cscavenger hunt\u201d, with suspense building about whether Fuchs would say \u201cYes!\u201d, all playing out on their Instagram accounts. So, a bit like the famous Ross and Rachel cliffhanger on Friends, if they\u2019d been tragic and unable to stop photographing and filming themselves to well-known scenes: Ross: \u201cWe were on a break! (crying emoji).\u201d Rachel: \u201cHave you got an Instagram story of me agreeing to that or has it expired? (broken heart emoji).\u201d Unfortunately, for at least 193,001 people, the cliffhanger ending (would Marissa accept Gabriel?) was compromised by Fuchs knowing about the proposal all along. In fact, as revealed by US magazine, Atlantic, they\u2019d planned the whole \u201csurprise marriage proposal\u201d itinerary together (on detailed spreadsheets), all the way to Fuchs\u2019s joyous astonished acceptance, and had offered brands \u201cthe opportunity to align with this momentous occasion\u201d. Excuse me, I think I\u2019ve got something in my eye.Fuchs and Grossman aren\u2019t the first couple to attempt to monetise a life event; the only surprise here is \u2013 who\u2019s surprised? Perhaps all that\u2019s needed is a subtle tweak of terminology. Time was, it was said, rather grandly, that people \u201ccurated\u201d their lives on social media, but is that entirely accurate? \u201cCurated\u201d suggests museums \u2013 historical, artistic, cultural endeavours \u2013 and experiences that are frequently free. Instagram is all about the price tag. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
