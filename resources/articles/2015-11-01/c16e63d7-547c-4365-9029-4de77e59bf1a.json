All three were workers at the Karranga Station in Scadden, north of Esperance. A local man also died. Briton Tom Butcher, 31, died as he tried to save his girlfriend\u2019s horse from the huge fire near the town of Esperance, his employer told the Australian newspaper. A mechanic who was planning to buy a house with his girlfriend after moving to Australia four years ago, he had been living in the town for the past year. \u201cI spoke to him on Friday evening and his last words to me were \u201cI\u2019m living the dream mate, I\u2019m living the dream\u201d,\u201d his sister, Jess Greenaway, told WA Today. \u201cTom had a heart of gold and he would do anything for anyone.\u201d His girlfriend, Leila Vadnjal, wrote on Facebook that she didn\u2019t \u201cgo an hour\u201d without talking to him. She described Butcher as her hero. \u201cFeeling lost is an understatement,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI told you every day I need a cuddle and today I need it most.\u201d The other victims were named as Anna Winther, 29, from Norway, and Julia Kohrs-Lichte, 19, from Germany. Their employer, Linda Campbell, told the Australian newspaper that she and Butcher thought there was enough time for him to leave the Campbells\u2019 farm with Winther and Kohrs-Lichte and drive towards Esperance to drop off the horse at Vadnjal\u2019s stables. Campbell said she had suggested her daughter go with the other three, but she had opted to stay at the farm. The homestead was undamaged. The local man who died, Kym \u201cFreddy\u201d Curnow, 45, has been hailed as a hero for trying to stop the trio and others driving into danger. But they and Curnow were overwhelmed by smoke a few kilometres from the farm, apparently after heeding Curnow\u2019s warning for them to turn around but failing to outrun the rapidly moving fire. Curnow had stopped several cars driving into the blaze in the Grass Patch and Salmon Gums areas, north of Esperance, on Tuesday. It is believed Winther and Kohrs-Lichte had arrived to work on the farm only two weeks ago. Perth\u2019s Curtin university said Winther had graduated with a master\u2019s degree in human rights last year. She is believed to have been working for Amnesty International, with one of her colleagues, Amelia Freelander, tweeting; \u201cVery sad to hear that Amnesty Activist Anna Winther was one of 4 to perish in the #EsperanceFires\u201d. Curnow\u2019s friend Glen Quinlivan held back tears talking about the Scadden farmer on Thursday. \u201cWe were full tilt in our fire truck, trying to get away from it and only just made it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnyone who was behind us had no chance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about heroics, it\u2019s just you do what you\u2019ve got to do, and he did what he had to do. Guy Green, whose family lost farms, machinery and houses, said his life would never be the same without Curnow. \u201cNot all heroes wear capes or a suit,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cWe\u2019ve all lost a great mate and to us younger boys a father figure. \u201cYou were much more than a hero and risked your life doing what you always did.\u201d Western Australian premier, Colin Barnett, said the deaths were tragic. \u201cForeign nationals who came to Australia to work and have a good time, and tragically and sadly, they\u2019ve lost their life,\u201d he said. About 135,000 hectares have been burnt by the fire and the alert level remained at \u201cwatch and act\u201d on Thursday evening. The Bureau of Meteorology said temperatures would gradually rise on Saturday and thunderstorms could form on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
