But if you scrub the oils off your skin, it will end up producing more to compensate. \u201cMoisturise your skin so that it is well hydrated and that will turn off your oil production more effectively than trying to scrub away the oil.\u201d Don\u2019t block your pores \u201cThe usual suspects are sunscreens,\u201d says Erica MacCallum of facialists Eve Lom in New York. So if you use one daily, look for one labelled non-comedogenic (non-clogging) or oil-free. \u201cAnd never sleep in your makeup.\u201d Sandy Skotnicki, a dermatologist based in Toronto, says that even hair products \u2013 \u201cin particular argan and coconut oils\u201d \u2013 can contribute to facial acne, so \u201cit is important to wash them out before you sleep\u201d. Exfoliation will help to keep pores clear and Shergill recommends skin products with 2% salicylic acid \u201cand a little more glycolic acid, which can help exfoliate dead skin cells that could cause blockages\u201d. Zap spots with antibacterials \u201cPeople think acne is an infection, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Shergill. \u201cIt is inflammation of the skin that allows an overgrowth of bacteria. The body tries to kill the bugs and causes the big red reaction, which is the spot.\u201d If one lasts for longer than 10 days, it can scar. \u201cWe need to get on and treat spots when they come up,\u201d says Shergill. \u201cWe often use drugs such as benzoyl peroxide. If you prefer an alternative treatment, tea-tree oil can be effective.\u201d As well as killing germs, tea tree has anti-inflammatory properties. To avoid irritation, Shergill recommends diluting it to 5%. Be kind to your skin \u201cNever squeeze a spot,\u201d says Shergill. \u201cThe spots will express themselves when you wash your face.\u201d And squeezing \u201cblind spots\u201d, where skin has grown over the top, is futile and can lead to scarring. Lay off the sweet treats When you eat cake, or other high-glycaemic-index (GI) foods, you are likely to produce extra insulin. There is evidence, says Shergill, that high-GI diets and insulin spikes \u201ccorrelate with facial serum excretion \u2013 you make more oil. Whereas a low-glycaemic-load diet significantly reduces lesion counts. So a low-glycaemic-index diet is apparently very effective.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
