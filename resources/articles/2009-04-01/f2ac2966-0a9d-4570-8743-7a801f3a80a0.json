When we're young and start to notice other quite interesting people we tend to be fascinated by their hair. It might be what they do with it and why they do it. It might be just the colour. For the Sensational Alex Harvey Band it's the length. The music they love is made by longhairs, people whose ideas are as gargantuan and lustrous as their crowning glory. Longhair music makes you want to \"wrap your brains around the sky, keep on eating that cherry pie\". Well, quite. Rod Stewart (5ft 2in), someone who knows a thing or two about hair, claims that Blondes Have More Fun. \"You can keep your black and your redheads, you can keep your brunettes too,\" he yells. \"Don't wanna subservient woman, gimme a blonde that's six foot two.\" Good luck with that, \"the mod\". The object of McFly's desire cooks in the nude and has a tattoo that's \"always hidden by her underwear\", but her defining characteristic is the 5 Colours in Her Hair. Syd Barrett, by way of James Joyce's Poem V, wants nothing but Golden Hair. While John Barry dispenses with words all together, allowing only his music to create The Girl with the Sun in Her Hair. Junior Byles's Curly Locks is the most beautifully controlled piece of political rock. Byles is \"a dreadlocks\", someone whose choice of haircut means he's seen as a deeply unsuitable partner: \"Your daddy say you shouldn't play with me.\" But it's clear what a decent man he is, \"Curly locks, two roads before you, which one will be your choice?\" Marlene Dietrich's \"charming, alarming\" Blonde Women are perhaps less decent. \"Be careful when you meet a sweet blonde stranger,\" she sings, \"You may not know it, but you're greeting danger.\" Blonde Redhead (two points already) state, \"I've gone too far, was it enough to make you sick?\" Their dreams of forgiveness and serenity are focused on \"the day I lie next to you and you stroke my impure hair\". And if it's impure hair you're after, the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band's King of Scurf tackles devilish dandruff \u2013 a surprisingly absent topic in popular music. This week I'm after songs about actors, people who spend their working lives pretending to be someone else, somewhere else, doing something else. They might look unbearably cool, but more often than not, they're damaged individuals looking to sort out their psycho-dramas while we pick up the bill. Thrilling? Yes. Alluring? Undoubtedly. But the trouble really starts when they, or we, lose sight of the fact they're just doing a job and everything tips into a rudderless wonderland. Or am I over-thinking it all? Anyway, there's a collaborative Spotify playlist here. Deadline is midday Monday; please note that posts should not contain more than a third of a song's lyrics. The A-Z and RR archive are waving toy guns at each other, while the Overspill blog sports a sombre look and a skull in its hand.
