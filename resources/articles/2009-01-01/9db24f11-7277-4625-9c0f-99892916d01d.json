The leader of the Senate's Democrats, Harry Reid, said: \"The race in Minnesota is over.\" But the result, coming more than two months after Election Day, does not yet end the contentious and costly legal battle between Franken and Coleman, who won the seat in 2002. Coleman's attorney today pledged to file a lawsuit contesting the result, and the ongoing dispute threatens to keep Minnesota from enjoying full representation in the upcoming congressional debate over Barack Obama's fiscal stimulus proposal. The Senate reconvenes tomorrow. The Republican national committee's chairman, Mike Duncan, voiced support for Coleman's lawsuit and decried Democrats' efforts to seat Franken: \"The efforts of Al Franken, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer to steal this election and seat Al Franken despite not having an election certificate are unprecedented.\" The Minnesota State Canvassing Board today certified that Franken, a former writer and performer on NBC television's Saturday Night Live sketch show, had won a recount by 225 votes, less than one one-hundredth of a percent of the total 2.4m ballot cast. That overturns the result on election day, which showed Coleman ahead by 215 votes. \"This process isn't at an end,\" Coleman's attorney Tony Trimble said, according to the Associated Press. \"It is now just at the beginning.\" He said that irregularities in the recount mean there \"can be no confidence\" in its outcome. The legal dispute could continue for months, although Coleman's window for victory appears narrow. The recount battle has been one of the longest in memory \u2013 even longer than the fight between vice-president Al Gore and George Bush following the 2000 presidential election. The two campaigns have fought over whether to count certain absentee ballots and ambiguous ballots, with Coleman's campaign also charging that some ballots had been counted twice. Today's ruling came just hours after the Minnesota Supreme Court declined Coleman's request to reconsider hundreds of rejected absentee ballots. Two other Senate seats remain in flux. Roland Burris, appointed by Illinois's embattled governor, Rod Blagojevich, to the seat vacated by Barack Obama, today flew to Washington for a series of meetings with Senate leaders who have said they will bar him from serving. New York's governor, David Paterson, is said strongly to be considering Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President John Kennedy, to fill Hillary Clinton's seat. Obama nominated Clinton secretary of state"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
