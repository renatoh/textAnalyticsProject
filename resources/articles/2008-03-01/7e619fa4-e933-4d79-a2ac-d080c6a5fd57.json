The club, who were in the Championship in 2005, also went into administration two summers ago and were hit by an identical penalty which led to their relegation last season. Their hopes of instant promotion have been hit, with the team now six points off the play-offs. \"This is a sad day for the club but we are hopeful that by working closely with the administrators the club can live to fight another day,\" said Rotherham's chairman, Denis Coleman. \"We are desperate to make it back into the play-off places despite the 10-point deduction.\" Rotherham confirmed a fortnight ago that their notice of intention to appoint an administrator had been extended. The club were given until the middle of this month to try to find investment. \"Contrary to popular misconception and recent press reports, delaying the administration until March 27 will not allow the club to postpone a 10-point penalty until next season,\" the club said. \"The date of March 27 would only be relevant if the club was definitely going to be relegated.\" Jeremy Bleazard of the insolvency specialists XL Business Solutions has been appointed to run the club during administration with a view to a sale. \"We need people to come forward immediately,\" he said. \"The survival of the club depends on finding a purchaser. \" Blackburn Rovers have signed the Switzerland midfielder Johann Vogel after the 31-year-old impressed on trial. Vogel, whose previous clubs include Milan and PSV Eindhoven, was a free agent after being released by Real Betis following a legal dispute with the club. He has a 2\u00bd-deal with the option of a further year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
