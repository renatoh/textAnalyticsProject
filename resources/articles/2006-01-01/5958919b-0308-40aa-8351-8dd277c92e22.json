The English champions scored two touchdowns in each half and, for the most part, held the whip hand at the breakdown and that extra creativity in the three-quarters. It promises to be onwards and upwards for Wasps from now. But whatever the result yesterday, it has been a mighty encouraging season so far for the Exiles. Under the stewardship of Brian Smith, they have been giving the ball a bit more width - which is still not a great deal - but, more importantly, they have been winning matches, which was sometimes an elusive quality last year. Nine victories in 10 games before this game, the last of which - a last-gasp win at Saracens on Tuesday - lifted Irish to the giddy heights of third in the table. OK, that run included triumphs against teams such as Pau and Parma in the European Challenge Cup, but it is no bad team that does the double over Agen and also sends Bath, Gloucester and Cardiff packing from the Madejski within the space of a month. Mindful of having to play three games in 13 days, however, Smith included only three players who started the match at Saracens. In a scrappy opening quarter, Ross Laidlaw produced a curate's egg of a performance, kicking reasonably effectively out of hand and knocking over a couple of penalty goals to cancel those scored by Mark van Gisbergen, but offering a mixed service to Matt Catt outside him. Still, he looks a confident player and he also made a couple of decent half-breaks after the interval. Both sides came close to scoring in those first 20 minutes - with Eoin Reddan, the Wasps scrum-half, covering back well after Delon Armitage had intercepted Stuart Abbott's wayward pass and kicked ahead while Jonny O'Connor was held up over the line. But, those moments apart, it was more a monotonous kicking duel and a litany of misplaced passes until Wasps scored their first touchdown after 26 minutes to take a 13-6 lead. And a smart try it was, too, with Lawrence Dallaglio shipping the ball quickly away from the outside-centre berth to Tom Voyce, who effected a delightful inside-pass to allow Josh Lewsey a clear run to the posts. Aside from the lineout, where Ryan Strudwick and Nick Kennedy were both a constant thorn on the Wasps throw, the Irish forwards - in front of the biggest club attendance of the season excepting the Twickenham double-header - never truthfully built up a head of steam until Bob Casey entered the fray as a second-half replacement. With Faan Rautenbach the only survivor from the pack that took the field against Sarries, maybe Smith made too many changes. And by picking a bench that included five forwards and only two backs, he was forced to replace the injured Catt with Juan Manuel Leguizamon, a No 8 by trade. Wasps quickly extended their advantage to 20-6 when Joe Worsley - playing his first game since mid-October - drove off the back of a line-out maul and cantered over with the defence awol and the visiting side were never in danger thereafter, despite an improved showing by the Exiles after the break. Ibanez was fed by George Skivington for Wasps' third try after Lewsey had butchered a two-man overlap, whereupon Casey crashed over for the Exiles following an exquisite inside flip-pass by Darren Edwards. Skivington's try in added time was merely icing on the cake for Wasps, who were worthy winners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
