Most of them have been debunked. Despite all the spin about \u201csupplementary payments\u201d, for example, there are more than 300,000 Australians forced to survive on $40 a day, before rent, utilities and food. And those who get extra money don\u2019t get much, particularly those without children. \u201cNo one has ever said it would be easy to live without a job\u201d is how the social services minister, Anne Ruston, has put it. Morrison\u2019s response is a mantra \u2013 \u201cthe best form of welfare is a job\u201d \u2013 that does not really engage with the core question: How does he imagine people on Newstart actually live on $40 a day? What does life on Newstart actually look like? Lisa Carberry, 48 Weekly income: $343.70 Newstart: $277.85 a week Energy supplement: $4.40 a week Rent assistance: $65.85 a week Pharmaceutical allowance: $6.20 a week Regular expenses: $304.20 Rent: $149 a week Car repayments: $136.15 a week (paid monthly) Phone: $11.55 a week (paid monthly) Robodebt: $7.50 a week Left with before food, utilities: $5.60 a day It\u2019s two days after Lisa Carberry\u2019s fortnightly Newstart payments went into her bank account and she is already down to her last $10. \u201cI now have $9.95 to last me for the next two weeks,\u201d she says over the phone from her home in Geelong. Carberry has been on Newstart for about three years \u2013 the average period of time a person can expect to spend on the payment, according to the government\u2019s own data. Every month, her bank balance takes a big hit when her car repayments are due. To tide her over, she will get some food and fuel vouchers from the local Vinnies. This week, she will also tell her community housing provider the rent will be late. \u201cI have to either not pay a bill or access charities for food and things in order to continue to tread water,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it is. It\u2019s treading water. It\u2019s not swimming.\u201d The car means a lot to her. Carberry bought her Kia Optima a few years ago when she was still employed. That was before the place she worked at went bust and her mum got sick. Things got tough from there. She moved in with her mother and received a carer\u2019s pension of about $900 a fortnight. When her mother died in 2015, she was put on Newstart. She struggled with the rent and was soon served with a \u201cno grounds\u201d eviction. Despite some stints in casual work, Carberry has been on the dole ever since. By the end of 2016, she was living in her car. She is desperate to hang on to it now. She says: \u201cBecause it was under finance, I would not have actually ended up with any money for myself to get another vehicle or to do anything with. Whatever the car was sold for, that would have all gone to the finance company with the chance that I would have still owed them money.\u201d Carberry has a teaching degree and has worked as a security guard. She is a strong advocate for herself and others on Newstart. Once, after Carberry\u2019s mother had died and she had fallen behind on her payments, the car was repossessed. It was returned after she complained to the ombudsman. In February, Carberry got a roof over her head through a community housing provider. Her rent is about $150 a week. Normally, Carberry would have a bit more money than $10 to get her through the fortnight. But this week, she went to Bunnings after her weekly grocery shop and bought the cheapest Venetian blinds she could find for $23. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do it for ages to give myself light in my unit and some privacy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I can have my blinds up and not have everybody see in. \u201cBut I\u2019ve financially suffered for doing that. That has taken months for me to do. I\u2019ve been in here since February.\u201d Centrelink also deducts $15 a fortnight from her Newstart payments for a Robodebt from 2012. Carberry says she intends to challenge it. Like about 30% of people on Newstart, she gets rental assistance, but it doesn\u2019t get close to covering her rent. Right now, she is battling an illness \u2013 and has been exempted from looking for work since April. She will have surgery soon. Carberry laughs when she is asked about the last time she treated herself. She nominates the new blinds. There was also some chocolate she got in a hamper brought by Vinnies. \u201cI can\u2019t go to Starbucks or Gloria Jeans and just say, \u2018Can I have a latte, please?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve got the health issues, I want to keep my fitness up after my operation. \u201cI can\u2019t even look at going to the local council pool for a swim.\u201d There are also her two pets: a dog called Toohey and Phoenix, her cat. She puts a conservative estimate of her actual expenditure on food for the three of them at $60 a week. When she was living in her car, people sometimes asked why she kept her pets. \u201cAnd my response to that kind of comment was \u2026 \u2018Well, these are my children, these are my family. And I am not giving them up,\u2019\u201d she says. Peter Cooney, 58 Weekly income: $282.25 Newstart: $277.85 Energy supplement: $4.40 Regular expenses: $213.41 a week Rent: $120 a week Storage unit: $41.50 a week (paid monthly) Welfare debts: $32.50 a week Court fines: $12.50 a week Phone: $6.90 a week (paid monthly) Left with before food: $9.85 a day Like Lisa Carberry, Peter Cooney\u2019s route onto Newstart began with a good deed. His mother was sick and could not look after herself. So he quit his job and moved in with her. His sister joined them shortly after. Within 10 months of each other, they had both died. Of a brain haemorrhage and a heart attack. \u201cThey left me with a house that I could no longer afford to rent,\u201d Cooney says. \u201cEventually I got kicked out of there and I had nowhere to put the furniture.\u201d Cooney has been unemployed for about a year and is as good as homeless. Because he had nowhere to go, an ex-partner lets him stay at her place in the suburbs of Perth. He pays about $120 \u2013 cheaper than anything he could get in the private market. But it\u2019s a turbulent situation. \u201cThings haven\u2019t been all that rosy there, so quite a few times I\u2019ll just go sleep in the car,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a place down in Ocean Reef where the powers that be turn a blind eye.\u201d Cooney has worked in furniture removal, once managed a hotel in Cairns and, before he quit to care for his mum, he was a brick paver. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a young man\u2019s game,\u201d he says. \u201cI rang a paver a while back and he asked how old I was. I said, \u201858\u2019. And he said, \u2018You\u2019re joking?\u2019 And that was the end of that.\u201d Automatic deductions from his Newstart include two welfare debts and some outstanding fines. So he has only $237.47 coming in each week. \u201cI haven\u2019t been surviving \u2013 I\u2019ve sort of been leaning on other people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit demeaning. You lose a bit of self-respect.\u201d Cooney is a smoker, pays $30 a month for his phone, and there are also his belongings, which are kept in a storage locker for $180 a month. He would be happy to ditch the furniture, but he could not stand to give up his books. \u201cReading is about the only hobby I\u2019ve got, really,\u201d he says. His only other treat is the occasional beer from Aldi. \u201cI\u2019ll often just eat once a day,\u201d he says. \u201cI eat a lot of instant noodles, with eggs and some frozen vegies in it. Or a chicken, maybe.\u201d The diet is a problem because his doctor has already warned him about his arteries: \u201cMy father died actually four years older than I am now from a heart attack.\u201d Recently, his doctor also referred him to a psychiatrist. He thinks he might have ADD. \u201cHe gave me two to see \u2013 one was $200 and one was $300 for a visit.\u201d He couldn\u2019t go. Cooney\u2019s priority is finding a place to live. \u201cIf I could get enough just to like rent a tiny little place, a room or even one of those portable things that some of the van parks have or something, but you know, you can\u2019t get something for $150,\u201d he says. \u201cEven in share houses now, people are asking for $150 for a room.\u201d What does he think about Morrison\u2019s line: \u201cThe best form of welfare is a job\u201d? \u201cWell, I\u2019m quite happy, if they can find me a job, I\u2019d rather be working,\u201d he says. \u201cBut unfortunately, with my qualifications and my age, it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d Aeryn Brown, 35 Weekly income: $285.35 Newstart: $277.85 Energy supplement: $4.40 Pharmaceutical allowance: $3.10 Regular expenses: $122.65 a week Rent: $69.45 (deducted from Newstart) Electricity: $10 (deducted from Newstart) Internet: $15.90 a week (paid monthly) Phone: $6.90 a week (paid monthly) Netflix: $2.30 a week (paid monthly) Home and contents insurance: $8.10 a week (paid monthly) Opal card: $10 a week Left with before food: $23.24 a day By December, Aeryn Brown will have been on Newstart for two years. Before that, she was studying \u2013 she has a bachelor of arts/communication from the University of Technology Sydney and a diploma. All up, she\u2019s \u201cbeen with Centrelink for eight years\u201d. \u201cYou just barely survive on this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not living, it\u2019s surviving.\u201d At the end of the fortnight, Brown is not left with much. But she is in public housing near Wollongong and considers herself lucky in that respect. \u201cSometimes I will be down to $20,\u201d Brown says. \u201cIf I have no money, I just stay home and eat what I\u2019ve got in the kitchen, really.\u201d She watches her bank account \u201clike a hawk\u201d, and when she reels off an itemised list of her spending, it\u2019s obvious she means it. Internet $69 a month (Brown is looking for a new plan). $10 a week for her Opal card. $30 a month for her phone. $10 on Netflix. Groceries $60 a week. Brown buys home-brand products, except for pasta sauce because the \u201chome-brand stuff all has onions in it\u201d, which she doesn\u2019t eat. At home, she cooks on Monday and will eat the same food for four days in a row. Chocolate milk is an occasional treat. Brown\u2019s last holiday was five years ago for a weekend in Perth. She goes to the movies once or twice a year. She is studying a certificate three in community services. She\u2019ll take a Cup-a-Soup and a mug for lunch. \u201cI can get boiling water at class.\u201d When larger expenses come up, it\u2019s a problem. The last time she needed new glasses, Brown had to ask her parents to pay the $200 gap. (They also pay her private health insurance.) \u201cAnything beyond $200 and I\u2019d be screwed,\u201d she says. Brown has anxiety and depression and so she has now been spared what she calls the \u201cabsolutely terrible\u201d Jobactive program. Instead, she is on the disability employment services program and is only required to look for four jobs a month. She is desperate to work. \u201cIt makes me so angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want somebody to give me a go.\u201d Under her mental health plan, she gets 10 free sessions a year with a psychologist. \u201cThat\u2019s bugger-all. I\u2019ll use those up and less than six months,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve gone, they\u2019re gone. I can\u2019t get any more for a year, and I can\u2019t afford to pay.\u201d If Newstart was increased, she could also buy better food and put more money on her Opal card. Even now, her job search is restricted to places that are close to public transport. She can\u2019t afford to buy a car and she can\u2019t afford lessons to get her licence, anyway. \u201cI could actually buy stuff because I want them, not because I need them,\u201d she says. \u201cLike I could buy new clothes because I want them, not because my clothes are wearing out, and I can\u2019t just keep mending them. \u201cBasically, if my shirts start to fray, I mend it, I sew the hem back up. Holes in my jeans, I patch them. I have a couple pair of jeans and they\u2019re ripped and that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t buy new unless they\u2019re like really, really, cheap.\u201d But the difference would not just be material. Money is stress. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful because I just don\u2019t have enough of it.\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
