The one dotty thing about her 1927 Concerto for Violin, Horn and Orchestra is its choice of the solo pairing, one that Smyth was only intermittently able to bring off. Tasmin Little's Stradivarius ran rings around Richard Watkins's horn in terms of agility, but was trumped whenever he reached mezzo forte. Both players, however, relished Smyth's lyricism, expressed in a first-movement theme of easy flow and a second movement in which harmonic shifts provide uplift without sentimentality. Not a lost masterpiece, then, but a curiosity well worth hearing - and a model of good taste next to the concert's opener, Henry Wood's elephantine orchestral arrangement of Bach's Toccata and Fugue D minor for organ. If you have ever wondered what the famous fugal melody sounds like on tuba, this is for you; Wood originally put another composer's name on the arrangement for a joke, but maybe he just did not want to own up to it. The second half began with Wood's almost equally gargantuan version of Rachmaninov's Prelude in C Sharp minor; the string section were moving their bows in the opening bars, so must have been playing, but the organ thunder on the opening three notes was such that we could not tell. Rachmaninov got much lighter treatment under the young Swedish conductor Stefan Solyom, who smiled his way through a fleet reading of the Second Symphony. Even in the slow movement, Solyom kept cloying emotionality at bay with a combination of delicate sweetness and sheer pace, without quite making this overblown work seem whole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
