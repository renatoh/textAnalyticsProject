I\u2019ve had to work for this\u2019", "bodyText": "\u201cMy friends in Kennington always ask me: \u2018Can I have a shirt for my little brother or my cousin?\u2019 And I always send them shirts,\u201d says Jadon Sancho. \u201cI will never forget where I have come from because I know what it is like growing up in that area \u2026 it is not nice. Especially when you have people around you doing bad things.\u201d More than a month away from celebrating his 19th birthday, the first player born this millennium to represent England and a trailblazer for his generation is holding court at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Westfalenstadion. Dressed in a turquoise green tracksuit and immaculate matching trainers, the unassuming Sancho does not come across as the most coveted teenager in world football as he makes a point of shaking hands with every journalist around the table with the greeting, \u201cnice to meet you\u201d. Clearly at ease in his surroundings in western Germany as he prepares for his return to London to face Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday, he is taller and broader in the shoulders than this time last year; something the makers of the Fifa video game may want to take note of. \u201cI am stronger than it says,\u201d he says, laughing. The boy from the Guinness Trust Buildings estate who left home at 12 has now become a man. \u201cFor the kids that are in south London I hope I can give a positive message,\u201d he adds, intently. \u201cDon\u2019t do those bad things. You don\u2019t have to be footballers. You could focus on your school work. Education is the most important thing and a lot of kids in south London get distracted from education.\u201d Had he not been blessed with a talent with the ball that convinced his headteacher at Crampton primary school he was destined to be a star when she first saw him as a five-year-old, Sancho knows his story could have turned out very differently. Eight goals \u2013 including the brilliant finish from a tight angle in Saturday\u2019s 3-3 draw with Hoffenheim \u2013 and nine assists in the Bundesliga this season have allowed Lucien Favre\u2019s vibrant young Dortmund side to dream of winning a first title since 2012. His bold decision to reject a new contract with Manchester City worth \u00a330,000-a-week and move to Germany in search of first-team football is proving a masterstroke. Yet just like on the pitch, where his outstanding skill and dribbling speed have made him a social media sensation and earned comparisons with Neymar, Sancho has always been prepared to take risks. Having joined Watford aged seven, he would travel across London three nights a week to train and was later persuaded to leave his friends and family behind to join the club\u2019s affiliated school, Harefield Academy in Uxbridge, west London. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go to that boarding school,\u201d Sancho reflects nearly seven years on. \u201cI wanted to stay at home and travel but the people around me told me what was best and I listened to them. I am happy that I am here today, where I am.\u201d Now sharing an apartment with his father, Sean, a former security guard, near Dortmund\u2019s impressive home, Sancho is in regular touch with his mother and friends back in Kennington and says he is enjoying life in \u201ca chilled city\u201d, even if he admits \u201clearning German will be always kind of hard to me. But I\u2019m getting the basics right,\u201d he adds with enthusiasm, \u201cworking up on speaking German in training. I know what the manager is saying in training sessions, which makes it easier for me and for the players also: that\u2019s how you interact, you come together more. \u201cMe being so comfortable being abroad is due to the fact I\u2019ve always been away from home. When I first left home it was very difficult, because I wasn\u2019t used to it, I was always with my mum. The first couple of years were very tough and then as I got older people started to tell me: \u2018It\u2019s either this or going back home.\u2019 And I always loved football, so I always chose the hard option. That\u2019s what\u2019s made me more comfortable being away from home than other people, so I\u2019m kind of lucky.\u201d Last month, Chelsea rejected a bid of \u00a335m from Bayern Munich for Callum Hudson-Odoi that would have made him the most expensive British teenager. Germany\u2019s most successful club remain confident of signing him in the summer and it is no exaggeration to say that Sancho\u2019s impact at Dortmund since he was handed Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s No 7 shirt in 2017 has been a major influence in their determination to sign his former England Under\u201117 teammate. BVB\u2019s sporting director, Michael Zorc, said it was during a youth international that they first became aware of Sancho\u2019s extraordinary ability and subsequently made every effort to persuade him to leave City. But having come up against his childhood friend Reiss Nelson against Hoffenheim on Saturday \u2013 the 19-year-old is on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season \u2013 and with several other English teenagers starting to follow in Sancho\u2019s slipstream as opportunities for young players in the Premier League continue to be scarce, he is quick to explain that the adaptation has taken time. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019ve had to work for this. Everyone around me is keeping me grounded and keeping me focused. I\u2019m improving every day and Marco Reus, Mario G\u00f6tze and Axel Witsel are great role models to me and everyone else in the team. It\u2019s really nice to have them around telling me what to do, and what\u2019s not good, helping me solve things I wouldn\u2019t solve by myself, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d Sancho adds: \u201c[Coming to Germany] was about the youngsters here getting opportunities. I really felt Dortmund was the right club for me. They spoke to me and said the right things I wanted to hear. Now they\u2019re showing it and I couldn\u2019t thank them more.\u201d Sancho won his first senior England cap against Croatia in October and was visited in Dortmund last week by Gareth Southgate\u2019s assistant, Steve Holland. He is expected to be part of the squad that will face the Netherlands in June in the Nations League semi-final in Portugal but says being out of the spotlight in another country has allowed him to keep a distance from the developing hype surrounding him back home. \u201cI\u2019m not aware at all,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously I\u2019ve seen Twitter things, but I don\u2019t know how \u2026 I don\u2019t ask questions really, I just stay focused on what I\u2019m doing and just keep going forward. All this media. This is all new to me. This is all crazy. I never knew you could be so known over your success. I thought if you are doing well everyone talks obviously, the fans, but I never knew they would take so much interest, but this helps a young player, the media training. It helps them out but this is the biggest thing. This is crazy.\u201d It must be said that his innocence is rather endearing. Sancho also barely seems able to believe that he will be back in his home city to play against Tottenham in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Europe\u2019s premier club competition. Thirty members of his family and close friends will be at Wembley to see whether Dortmund can gain revenge for losing home and away to Spurs in the group stages last season. \u201cI feel like we have improved so it won\u2019t be the same match as last year. It will be more difficult for them. Especially as they have some big players missing out so it is going to be a tough one,\u201d Sancho says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling. I\u2019ll be playing in front of my family, which is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do since I was a young boy. Now I\u2019m able to do it and hopefully I can show London people what I\u2019m about. Everyone was messaging me saying: \u2018I need a ticket!\u2019 It\u2019s big. I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m playing in the Champions League. It is a big thing for me like it is for every player. That\u2019s the biggest stage in the world so I\u2019ve got to keep on working hard and hopefully I will get many more chances.\u201d As well as his quick feet and mesmerising ball control, Sancho attributes his fearless attitude to the hours and hours of cage matches he played as a child on the estate in Kennington. He plans to return to Crampton and Harefield at the end of the season to answer questions from pupils and is clearly passionate about giving something back to the community that helped raise him. \u201cI am trying to go back to my old schools first,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully, if things progress I can go to other schools and give things out from [sponsors] Nike. That would be nice for the school \u2013 like footballs and things like that. I was where they are once upon a time \u2026 just to give them a good message would be nice for them to hear.\u201d Eloquent, intelligent and with the world at his feet, Sancho is certainly a decent role model for any child of the 21st century."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
