This is only the second ECM album from this long-running but occasional band, and it's even better than its captivating predecessor, 2012's All Our Reasons. Tenor saxophonist Mark Turner's opener, Lennie's Groove (dedicated to the 1950s cool-school piano guru Lennie Tristano that distantly suggests the Lee Konitz classic Subconscious-Lee) is a breathtakingly serpentine, bop-phrased sax/piano melody over a disorientatingly shifting rhythmic feel. Pianist Ethan Iverson's Maraschino is laterally bluesy, while Hart's Amethyst sounds contemporary-classical at first but Turner colours it with rich Charles Lloydian hues while drums and bass patter and snap. Yard sounds like 21st-century Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk in tandem, and Some Enchanted Evening (the only standard) demonstrates Turner's capacity to turn melodic somersaults like an acrobat and land elegantly poised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
