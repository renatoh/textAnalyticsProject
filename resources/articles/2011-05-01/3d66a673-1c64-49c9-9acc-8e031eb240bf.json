At the end of it we know much more about the heroism of those who helped the injured; we know much more about the problems that were faced by the emergency services on the day, hampered as they were by dodgy radio and gaps in planning. There is a reason we know so much about it all \u2013 it's because the task of the judge was facilitated by an earlier investigation, the 7 July review conducted by the London assembly. Much of the credit for progress thus far, Hallett wrote, \"rests with the 7th July Review Committee\". Ken Livingstone, Labour's candidate for London mayor, was quick to applaud both the inquest findings and the coroner, hailing \"a clear and welcome set of recommendations that the relevant agencies must now consider\". But that did surprise many who remember his reaction as mayor on receiving the London Assembly's report in 2006. A slur on the emergency services, said Ken. What was the precise term he used? \"Nit-picking\". Still, now is now and then was then. \u2022 Yes, we really have all learned a great deal \u2013 and this must include the security services. Here the terms that one might reasonably employ are \"piss up\" and \"brewery\". One spook, seeking to follow a potentially important line of inquiry, turned to the file \u2013 but he could find \"no contemporaneous record\" of what had gone before. He was forced instead to \"visit retired desk officers at their homes to discover as best he could what they had done and why\". What a carry on. What price a decent filing cabinet? \u2022 Many sadnesses emerge from last week's elections. Not just the realisation that no one now agrees with Nick Clegg. One also thinks of all those who fought and lost the local battles: oh, the wasted potential. What fun we might have had with Robin Evans, who stood for the BNP in Blackburn amid claims that he used his Facebook account to write a tribute to Adolf Hitler and praise the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. \"It's not the BNP's forum,\" he apparently told a local reporter. \"It's my forum if I want to wish Colonel Gaddafi or Adolf Hitler a happy birthday. People can read what they want into it.\" Most did. \u2022 Staying in Blackburn, there is deep reflection still arising from the death of Osama bin Laden. Jack Straw, for one, is having a hard time coming to terms with it. Under the heading, \"Why I really feel so diminished\", Straw opens his heart to the Lancashire Telegraph. Bin Laden was \"one of the most wicked people of the world's postwar history. He was responsible for the deaths of thousands.\" But Jack feels \"diminished by the fact that we live in a world where this action \u2013 by the US special forces \u2013 was necessary; diminished by the notion that a fellow member of the human race, who by all accounts enjoyed a materially prosperous and secure childhood, should have become so monstrous as an adult; diminished that the pattern of history and events, especially across the Middle East and south Asia, should have provided such fertile ground for his pernicious, and ultimately self-defeating ideology.\" A fair bit of reaction on the paper's website \u2013 including the question: \"Do you feel diminished by voting for the war in Iraq?\" Jack's standing tall on that one. \u2022 Finally, to the British Film Institute in London where the French actor Isabelle Huppert received the prestigious BFI fellowship. Clearly touched, she balanced the heavy, glass award on her head and told the audience, including John Hurt, Bill Nighy and director Mike Figgis, how glad she was to receive it. She revealed herself as a deep thinker about her craft. \"You can put characters in two categories,\" she said. \"Those in high heels and those in flat shoes. It's very important and women understand it. You don't walk the same. In high heels, you can be very triumphant.\" The Piano Teacher was very flat-heeled, she said. \"I have not yet played a role where I have to wear clogs, but I'm ready.\" Excellent. Our morris dancing murder mystery script is on its way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
