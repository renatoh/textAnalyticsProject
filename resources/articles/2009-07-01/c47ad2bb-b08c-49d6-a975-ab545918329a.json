Hannah Jones, 14, from Marden, Herefordshire, who has been in and out of hospital since the age of four, said in November she did not want to go through the \"trauma\" of any more operations. But she has now been asked to be placed on the waiting for a heart transplant, after doctors found she had grown stronger and said that the operation would be less risky than previously thought. \"I know I decided I definitely didn't want this, but everyone's entitled to change their mind,\" Hannah said. Her decision is likely to focus attention once again on a number of medical and ethical questions. Last year it was reported that health officials applied to remove her from her home because they believed her parents were preventing her treatment. Her parents, Andrew and Kirsty Jones, said it was Hannah's decision to refuse the treatment and that she was mature enough to understand the consequences. At the time Hannah, who was then thought to be terminally ill, convinced a child protection officer to argue for the abandonment of the court action. Doctors had warned her that the operation was risky and that even if it succeeded, she would need another heart within 10 years. Now doctors believe she could make a full recovery. \"The right side of my heart isn't beating at all and, after lots of tests, I realised there were more benefits to having a new heart to staying like I was,\" she said. \"If I had a new heart, I'd be on less tablets than I am at the moment.\" She made her decision to go on the waiting list having suffered kidney failure after her 14th birthday party. Speaking from Hereford hospital, Hannah added: \"I fell ill last Sunday but I just thought I'd overdone it on my birthday. Actually, it turned out it was my kidneys.\" She could not go on dialysis because her heart was too weak. A spokesman for NHS Herefordshire said: \"Our paediatricians work closely with Hannah and her family to ensure she has the care and support she needs.\" \"In our discussions with Hannah we are convinced she has the maturity and experience to make decisions for herself about her treatment and truly understands the implications.\" The trust denied it had tried to make her a ward of court last year in a bid to force her to undergo a heart transplant. \"No one can be or would ever be forced to undergo an operation if they do not wish it,\" the spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
