The transparency of lobbying, non-party campaigning, and trade union administration bill will have its second reading in the Lords on Tuesday. Under its terms, any organisation viewed as promoting a political message that spends more than \u00a35,000 during the runup to an election will have to submit to Electoral Commission oversight. The organisations \u2013 including the Women's Institute, the Taxpayers' Alliance, Business for Britain, Oxfam and Amnesty International \u2013 say this could have snuffed out campaigns such as those to ban land mines, remove lead from petrol and give women the right to equal pay. The move follows strong criticism of the bill from two parliamentary committees and from human rights lawyers. In a letter, the organisations say the proposed law could undermine democratic participation in this country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
