Siani, 41, who did not want to give her surname, pre-ordered and paid for contraception online through the Lloyds Pharmacy website. After arriving at a branch in Brighton to collect the medication, the pharmacist told her the product was ready but that she would not dispense it for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. The pharmacist did not disclose the reasons and was the only staff member in the store at the time. Despite being assured online that she could collect from any outlet, Siani was told to either return the next day or go to the nearest open branch \u2013 10 miles away in Newhaven. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s really offering an acceptable alternative at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that a big company like Lloyds can discriminate against women by having their only branch in the city that\u2019s open on a Sunday staffed by a lone pharmacist who won\u2019t dispense women\u2019s services.\u201d Siani said she did not want to \u201cgo after\u201d an individual for her beliefs but thought it was \u201creally important that women\u2019s access to reproductive health services isn\u2019t obstructed, and a big company like Lloyds ought to ensure that they make reasonable accommodation to ensure that if people won\u2019t dispense some medicines, they have other staff available who will.\u201d Lloyds Pharmacy said it was looking into the incident and admitted there was \u201cmore the pharmacist could have done for the patient\u201d. A spokesperson said the company encouraged pharmacists to use professional judgment but expected them to follow General Pharmaceutical Council guidelines on the application of personal beliefs. These guidelines specify that pharmacists are obliged to \u201crecognise their own values and beliefs but \u2026 not impose them on other people\u201d and \u201ctake responsibility for ensuring that person-centred care is not compromised because of personal values and beliefs\u201d. The spokesperson apologised for \u201cthe distress and frustration\u201d caused by the incident and said the company had reached out to Siani to ensure she had received the support she needed. Mandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, expressed concern and said \u201cwomen\u2019s reproductive rights are under threat the world over\u201d. \u201cIt is not the decision of individual pharmacists to dictate women\u2019s reproductive rights. I would expect the pharmacist to be sanctioned in the same way as if they denied any other health treatment or medicine,\u201d she said. A petition to prevent pharmacists refusing to dispense medication because of personal beliefs has been launched in response to the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
