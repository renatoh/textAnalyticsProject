Over two nights, he explained, the programmes would explore Franklin's move \"from the church to the charts\". They would, he added, \"say RESPECT to a true original\". But it was well worth persevering beyond that cheesy moment. Last night's programme covered the early years of her career and was a good listen even if you know the story quite well. Contributors made their points with lively phrases and fresh, memorable anecdotes. I liked cool old Bobby Womack's words for singers who came after Franklin: \"She's the natural. You're the duplication.\" Music journalist David Nathan recalled writing letters to her as a young fan, and addressing them simply care of her father, care of his church. \"Remarkably,\" he said, \"I did get a reply one day. I was actually in the middle of playing an Aretha Franklin song.\" He opened the package from the singer in his dad's fish-and-chip shop. The retelling of this was so redolent of a time when stars were magically remote, and Franklin little known. Other contributors mulled over what lies at the heart of her talent (\"one of the greatest interpreters of lyric\") between tracks that powerfully reminded you of its magnitude."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
