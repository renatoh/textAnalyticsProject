I\u2019m intolerant to chilli, so what can I use instead? Glenis, Canterbury Let\u2019s haul the culprits up in front of the whole class, ask them to explain themselves and see if they can come up with a solution by way of penance. First on the naughty step is Yotam Ottolenghi, whose fusion-themed 8 June column was a tad chilli-heavy, what with spiced caponata with silken tofu, cabbage with ginger cream and chilli oil, and saffron pasta with chipotle shallots and pickled chillies. \u201cWe\u2019re big chilli fans in the test kitchen,\u201d he admits, \u201cand undeniably that comes through in our food.\u201d Chillies vary hugely in heat and flavour, however: \u201cMild ones such as ancho add sweet, subtle notes, while robust ones like chipotle offer intense, smoky flavours. We use chilli to enhance a dish, adding complexity when called for and heat only when needed.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean his recipes are no-go areas for those with an aversion or intolerance. \u201cIf heat\u2019s not your thing, it\u2019s fine just to ditch them. Or try red bell pepper flakes instead of sweet or mild chilli, and smoked paprika to replace smokier chillies.\u201d Meera Sodha, whose recipe that week was a sweet potato pasta bake featuring half a teaspoon of Kashmiri chilli powder, agrees that different chillies perform different functions: \u201cA bird\u2019s-eye chilli might be used to balance sweetness or sourness, while fresh chilli can cut through fat or build warmth. Heat is not chillies\u2019 only role, which I think is why they are so loved by food writers and many readers alike.\u201d Which is not to say there is no sympathy for the chilli-averse. \u201cChilli is now a central part of how we cook and getting harder to avoid,\u201d says Anna Jones. \u201cI have one friend who puts it on everything, and that\u2019s not uncommon: a lot of people crave big flavours from every meal they eat.\u201d She herself is a fan of gentler flavours, even though her courgette column in the week in question featured chilli in both recipes. \u201cAt home, I often cook without chilli even if a recipe calls for it. I\u2019ll just use another spice or herb instead. It might not taste the same, but it\u2019s just as good.\u201d As far as substitutes go, first work out what purpose the chilli has in a dish and take it from there. \u201cIf it\u2019s smokiness,\u201d Sodha says, \u201ctry smoked garlic or smoked salt instead; if freshness, mint or lemon. Or just leave it out: I cook mostly Indian food, but if someone\u2019s allergic or intolerant, I simply don\u2019t use chilli, with no great loss to flavour.\u201d Black pepper, used lavishly, has a similar spicy effect, says Thomasina Miers, who that same week made pasta with peas, prawns and chilli: \u201cTake cacio e pepe pasta: that draws on pepper\u2019s hot, floral characteristics to add sparks of interest to an otherwise creamy dish.\u201d You can add zing in other ways, as well, with acidity being an especially favourite tool in professional kitchens: \u201cLook how a dish is transformed by a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime in the final moments,\u201d Miers says, \u201cor how a dash of vinegar can lift a sauce.\u201d Salt is essential, too (I know, I know, it\u2019s not good for us in excess, but we actually do need some in our diet). But it pays to season repeatedly, Miers says: \u201cFirst at the start, while the onions are sweating or the veg roasting, or when you take meat out of the fridge to come up to room temperature \u2013 salt brings out a food\u2019s natural flavours.\u201d Repeat as you\u2019re cooking, tasting as you go, and deliver a final dose before taking it to the table. And introduce savoury (or umami) notes with miso, parmesan, anchovies or yeast extract. Last but not least, Miers relies on fresh herbs \u2013 massive great bundles of the things: \u201cThey add wonderful accents and nuances of flavour.\u201d But forget those measly 30g supermarket packs that cost nearly a quid a pop \u2013 head to a market or Middle Eastern or Asian specialist, and you can pick up a bunch the size of your face for about the same price, if not cheaper. And it won\u2019t come wrapped in plastic, either. \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
