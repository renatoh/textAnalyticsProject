The vast majority of programming from across the BBC\u2019s stations will be available for 30 days after broadcast, including regular slots such as Annie Mac\u2019s weekday evening show on Radio 1 and almost every show from the BBC Proms on Radio 3, which start on Friday. Almost all of the 13,500 programmes broadcast each year by Radio 4 will also be available, as will broadcasts from the BBC\u2019s local and national stations. Listeners will be able to download the programmes from the middle of this week as updates to the Apple and Android iPlayer Radio apps are rolled out. A small number of shows, including some sports broadcasts, will not be available as the BBC does not have the rights to offer them for download. Downloads will be restricted to Wi-Fi, but the BBC has not ruled out introducing 3G and 4G downloads in the future. \u201cWith over 860m requests for radio streams across all devices on BBC iPlayer Radio in 2014, we\u2019re thrilled to bring offline listening to our audiences,\u201d said BBC Digital general manager of product for radio and music Andrew Scott. \u201cWe know this is something they\u2019ve been asking for and we have been working hard to make it possible.\u201d BBC radio controller for multiplatform Mark Friend said: \u201cThe spectacular success of the BBC\u2019s podcasts, with around 70m downloads in May, shows that people want to download high-quality audio to listen to at their convenience. Extending this to make almost all of the BBC\u2019s radio programmes downloadable, including comedy, music and drama, will delight our audience which has been asking for this.\u201d In October, the BBC extended the length of time after broadcast shows can be watched on iPlayer to 30 days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
