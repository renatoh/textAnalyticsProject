Because of knowing people like Tricky I think I am kind of much more open-minded about being common, but I can totally see where he is coming from. So I said to Dave, let's just borrow someone from Marlborough for a term because, seriously, when I was there they could turn around a noov overnight, much quicker than Eton. Or maybe some random geek from St Andrews could teach them history of art, because of course it was the Fra Angelico Annunciation that finally stopped Kate Middleton saying toilet. So it was just a question of which housemaster until there was all the idiotic fuss about the photographer and so thank God for Downton Abbey or I never would have thought of Julian Fellowes. Who is way better than any old special adviser, Dave says, because we have got his manners completely free in exchange for a peerage, and it turns out he really can smell people who say pardon! Dave blindfolded him and he walked round the cabinet table and picked out Huhne as well as the Fartmeister, which is understandable, Julian says, because the Strathclyde barony is only from 1955. Everyone was doing so brilliantly that Julian said his wife had kindly agreed to come to us for drinks, even though she is hypersensitive about breeding and the Hagues were her great-great-uncle Lord Kitchener's serfs until, sadly, the great war. So Haguey did a perfect prostration and she said how priceless, wait until I tell my dear friend Princess Michael of Kent, and it was all so fun until she asked where we were going for Christmas and I said Phuket. Well thank goodness Danny carries an Epipen, because when she had come round Julian said it could quite easily have killed her, he felt pretty nauseous himself. So now we are going to Chequers not Thailand, and I am wondering if making Fellowes a lord was such a brilliant idea after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
