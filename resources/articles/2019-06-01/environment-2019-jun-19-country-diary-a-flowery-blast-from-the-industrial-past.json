Until Dawdon colliery closed in 1991, coal mining waste, carried on conveyor belts, was tipped directly over the cliff. After 84 years of dumping, the vista was so bleak it was chosen as the filming location for the prison planet in the movie Alien 3. Since then wave action and the Turning the Tide programme of coastal regeneration has restored this coast to much of its former beauty. I follow the path down to the shore and walk under ledges where fulmars nest, and past steep scree slopes, created by natural rock falls, covered with the magenta blooms of bloody cranesbill (Geranium sanguineum). These soft magnesian limestone cliffs erode easily. For much of the past century a raised beach of colliery rock debris has kept the waves at bay, but since dumping ceased it has been eaten away with every storm, washed out to sea or slowly ground down to pebbles and coarse honey-coloured sand. The sea creeps closer to the base of the cliffs every year. Near Nose\u2019s Point, at the north end of the Blast, this artificial barrier is still high enough to shelter hawthorn and elder trees under the sheer rock face, protect a Phragmites reed bed and host the finest display of bird\u2019s-foot trefoil I have ever seen; a dazzling yellow carpet on a cloudless day of azure sea and sky. This bulwark has already been breached at the southern end of the beach and the days of those flowery scree slopes are surely numbered. At Hawthorn Hive, a smaller bay a mile south of here, much of a similar raised beach, once noted for its orchids and butterflies, has been swept clean by waves that have reached the bottom of the cliffs since I first visited 10 years ago. For now, the last vestiges of an industrial past are shielding the flora of the Blast from a similar fate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
