But Margaret McNamee, the fortunate mother of the two beautiful babies, and a \"practising Catholic\" (presumably off sick the day they did the \"judge not lest ye be judged\" section) would not like to see all women benefiting from the technique. \"I'd hate to see women in the future freezing their eggs for social reasons,\" she said. Don't you just love that \"social reasons\"? \"Yes, I've got to pop out to a dinner party for social reasons ... would you mind just sticking these eggs in the freezer for me?\" Anyone else finding this constant insistence that women who care enough to take mature and responsible decisions about bringing children into the world are the feckless ones, as opposed to those just plopping out a line of brats from the age of 18 onwards, unbelievably tiring? And if McNamee can pass on her genes, why can't we? Pity the poor wee girlies at American Vogue. Under the iron grip of Anna \"Nuclear\" Wintour, the only woman on Earth scarier than Mutya Sugababe, some like to stay so underweight that it stops the blood getting to their brains. At least, this is the only explanation I can think of for the news that when they needed a profile of hardly low-profile Zadie Smith they, uh, just stuck in the first picture of a mixed-race woman in a headscarf they came across. Perhaps malnutrition has begun to affect their eyeballs. This doesn't excuse the London Evening Standard compounding the mistake and running the picture again, once more suggesting she was Kilburn's most beautiful export. So who is this woman? Turns out she's not a writer at all, but an actor - Sara Powell. Breath is bated for golddiggers everywhere ... Anna Nicole Smith, has just been granted leave to appeal to the US supreme court, challenging her late nonagenarian husband's will in the hope of getting her hands on a cool $474m (\u00a3270m). It is her final attempt to convince the courts that, although J Howard Marshall II actually left his estate to his son, he had promised Smith that he'd look after her. A lesson for us all for the future - get the will in writing first, gigantic boobies later. A mistake any of us could have made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
