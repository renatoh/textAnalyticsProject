Up to yesterday, Lance Armstrong 's average speed for close on 1,800 miles was just over 25mph, a little quicker than the record he set in 1999. It is a spectacular achievement, but the spectacular in cycling today rarely comes without a proviso. Writing in the left-wing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, which casts a somewhat cynical spotlight on the Tour, the trainer Antoine Vayer has expressed surprise that speeds are currently higher than they were in the mid-1990s, held to be the high summer of drug abuse in cycling. The area is an old one, and a grey one: often high average speeds are the result of a favourable wind, or an aggressive mood in the peloton. Yesterday, for example, the stage winner Servais Knaven whizzed through the pinewoods of the Landes at a speed which would have seen off a v\u00e9lomoteur: close to 29mph for 113 miles. He and his nine breakaway companions sped away from the peloton the second the flag dropped on the outskirts of the rugby-playing town of Dax, and their reasoning was easy to work out: of the 22 teams in the Tour, only 10 have won stages to date. Tomorrow 's time-trial is for Lance Armstrong or Jan Ullrich; Sunday is for the sprinters. Time is running out for the majority who need to justify their existence here. Yesterday, the 10 to break away included representatives of five of the teams who have drawn a blank so far: Bram de Groot of Rabobank, Paolo Bossoni from Caldirola, Ivan Parra of Kelme, Leon van Bon of Lotto, and David Millar 's Cofidis team-mate Mederic Clain, who is known mainly for his peculiar name, and lack of results. The chase was intense for the first 25 miles of roads as flat as a cr\u00eape but 10 men working together can be a match for most teams,and the leaders included several who fit the vague description rouleur, the sort of cyclist who is utterly at his ease in this game of long-range cut and thrust: iBanesto 's Vicente Garcia Acosta; De Groot,who figured in a similar move en route to Marseille, and the swarthy Italian Salvatore Commesso, a stage winner in 1999 and 2000. Knaven was the joker in the pack: winner of the hardest single-day classic, Paris-Roubaix, in 2001 but until yesterday a domestique for Richard Virenque in the Belgian Quickstep-Davitamon squad .They have nothing to do with dancing, but are backed by a parquet floormaker, and a vitamin company. The pressure is off Quickstep,who have won more money in this Tour than any other team, and the Dutchman waltzed ahead 10 miles out, whereupon the nine played into his hands by ceasing to work as a unit, handing himstage victory on a plate. Stage finishes here are traditionally fought out by the sprinters and the peloton 's battle for 11th place outstripped the contest for the stage win in spectacle and interest. The sprinters ' green jersey is being hotly fought this year: currently there are seven men in with a chance of overall victory, tightly packed behind the leader Baden Cooke of Australia. Cooke 's fdjeux.com squad played a tactical blinder,placing one of their riders, Christophe Mengin, in the escape, which meant that they could sit back in the knowledge that Mengin would be able to go for the stage win and they would have to play no part in the chase, saving their energy for supporting Cooke in the sprint. This was only partly successful: Mengin did not have his wits about him when Knaven fled the coop,and Cooke lost out in the sprint for 11th to his two biggest rivals, last year 's points winner Robbie McEwen, and the six times maillot vert Erik Zabel.But he still has the lead, by a mere six points, and, as he said yesterday, this particular contest will go to the wire on the Champs Elys\u00e9es on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
