They fielded the bare bones of a side and Wigan took full advantage. The only surprise was that Wigan did not complete a League double by a bigger margin, having dictated much of the proceedings and created all the best chances. The City manager Stuart Pearce, mindful of an FA Cup sixth-round tie against West Ham tomorrow night, rang the changes. In addition to Andy Cole, missing his sixth match, there was no Joey Barton, Richard Dunne, Albert Riera or Darius Vassell in his 16, while Georgios Samaras started on the bench. By contrast Wigan were at full strength - and it showed as they took the game to City and passed up two early opportunities to take a grip on the game. Gary Teale cursed himself for directing a centre straight into the hands of David James after doing the hard work by cleverly creating space on the baseline. Then Henry Camara's shot on the run was struck powerfully enough but cleared the crossbar. A bizarre incident offered City some encouragement. John Filan, having collected Stephen Ireland's corner, struck Sylvain Distin with his attempt to throw the ball clear. It ricocheted back against the bar and City were somewhat aggrieved that referee Martin Atkinson gave a free-kick against them. Pearce was forced to bring on Samaras for Antoine Sibierski after 26 minutes. Soon after, James distinguished himself with a save low down from Teale, who had time to bring the ball down and measure his shot. Samaras started to win the ball in the air and his team looked a better prospect for it. The Greek striker also made a nuisance of himself on the ground, almost getting what would have been a telling touch as the ball bobbled around in front of goal after Wigan failed to clear. Two miscued clearances in quick succession left James red faced at the other end, but this time there was no reprieve as the resulting corner, swung in by Jimmy Bullard, was headed in by Lee McCulloch. Samaras had taken a knock just before the goal and with an hour gone he himself was replaced by Ishmael Miller, making his senior debut. McCulloch had the chance of making the points secure late on, but miscued his volley from the edge of the penalty area. City's last chance of salvaging something disappeared when Filan smothered Trevor Sinclair's low drive. Man of the match - Jimmy Bullard So much of Wigan's creative play revolves around Bullard and it is a responsibility he shoulders with relish. Energetic and imaginative, he was an influential figure and driving force in the midfield areas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
