In a field with nine of the current top 10 grandmasters, Carlsen needs eight out of 11 to tie his official monthly mark of 2882 rating points and nine out of 11 to break his unofficial daily record of 2889. He has won seven successive tournaments and has an unbeaten streak of 71 games. The 28-year-old demolished the world No 5, Anish Giri, with Black in 23 moves in Wednesday\u2019s opening round. It was revenge for the 22-mover, also with Black, which Giri won at Wijk 2011 and which the Dutchman used for years to taunt that he had a plus score against the No 1. Carlsen made only one queen move in the entire game and that was to the corner square a8 from where the queen was a long-distance general for his attack against Giri\u2019s king on the other side of the board. Giri failed to foresee it. This original strategy drew comparisons with the neural network program Alphazero, which Carlsen called his \u201chero\u201d in a recent interview. A previous Zagreb in 1970 was won by Bobby Fischer and the current event was initiated by Garry Kasparov, who later compared Carlsen\u2019s current form to Fischer\u2019s in 1970-72 and to his own peaks. Zagreb can be followed free and live online daily, starting at 3.30pm. Carlsen meets Shak Mamedyarov and Sergey Karjakin in the weekend rounds. Ian Nepomniachtchi, Russia\u2019s world No 4, leads on 3/3, followed by Wesley So (US) and Carlsen on 2/3. The Norwegian\u2019s record chances slipped when he conceded successive draws against Vishy Anand, the former champion, and Fabiano Caruana, the 2018 title challenger. Stavanger, the front runner to host Carlsen\u2019s 2020 world title defence, has withdrawn from the bidding after it emerged that Carlsen was unwilling to play there. Despite winning Altibox 2019 at Stavanger earlier this month, Carlsen\u2019s overall record in the annual elite event is patchy and includes two of the worst results of his career. It seems he regards it as a jinxed and stressful venue for him. Carlsen is arguably the most marketable world champion since Fischer in 1972, so Fide, the global chess body, expects several other bids for the 2020 championship match. A battle to become the new No 1 in English chess is in progress at Saint Louis, US, and Netanya, Israel. Nigel Short and Michael Adams, the best UK players for more than 30 years, are now aged 54 and 47. Short has dropped out of the world top 100 while Adams is below the elite 2700 rating for almost the first time in two decades, so the race has suddenly opened up. The live ratings show the struggle among Luke McShane, 35, David Howell, 28, and Gawain Jones, 31, who were boards two, three and four behind Adams when England won silver at the 2019 world team championship. Howell scored 5.5/10 to take joint second prize at the Saint Louis Summer Classic. He also captured the England No 1 position from Jones, who lost his final three games there and ended up in last place with 3.5/10. McShane won his first two rounds at Netanya before losing a miniature when his opponent sprang a surprise in the opening. White\u2019s 3 Nbd2 and 5 Bb5+ looks odd but plans a quick Qe2 and e5. Significantly, the database shows that Carlsen has played it three times and his creative aide Daniil Dubov twice, mostly in blitz. McShane took too long in the opening, his 14\u2026f6? (Bg7) proved a decisive error, and he fell back in the next three rounds to 3/6. 3625 1...Bxb3! If (a) 2 axb3 a2+! 3 Kxa2 Ra6+ 4 Kb1 Ra1 mate.
