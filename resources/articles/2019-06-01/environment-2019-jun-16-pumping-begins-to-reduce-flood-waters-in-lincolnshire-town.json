Police have advised residents in around 590 properties in Wainfleet and neighbouring areas to evacuate amid concerns about flood defences along the river Steeping. Parts of the market town near Skegness flooded on Wednesday after more than two months\u2019 worth of rain fell in two days. Three RAF helicopters dropped 270 one-tonne sandbags to repair the bank of the river. After evacuating 290 homes, police on Saturday published a further list of postcodes that needed to be to vacated, amounting to another 300 properties. They said the move was a \u201cprecautionary action\u201d and recommended that people stay in emergency accommodation or with family and friends. \u201cThose leaving their property need to turn off their electric if safe to do so and take medicine, pets, phone chargers, and essential items with them,\u201d read a statement by police. It was reported on Sunday that it residents might not be able to return home until Friday. Ch Insp Phil Vickers from Lincolnshire Police told the BBC: \u201cUntil we\u2019re satisfied that there isn\u2019t a risk to life, that there isn\u2019t a further risk to property, our advice will remain to stay out of that area.\u201d On Sunday, people in Wainfleet were asked by Anglian Water to refrain from using washing machines, toilets and showers. Portable toilets have been set up in the town centre and people have been advised to use showers at Skegness leisure centre. The Environment Agency has described the heavy rainfall in the area as \u201can unprecedented event\u201d and a rain gauge in Ulceby, 50 miles away from Wainfleet, recorded 132mm of rainfall between 10 and 12 June. In 2007, nearby Louth and Horncastle were flooded after 68mm of rainfall. On Sunday, high-volume pumps were in place to start trying to lower the water levels in the town. Sheena Engineer, a flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said the flood risk for Sunday and Monday remained low. \u201cIn Lincolnshire, Environment Agency staff are working 24/7 alongside the emergency services to protect people and property after a river embankment breached at Wainfleet,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an effort to reduce flood waters, our field teams will be operating two high-capacity ultra-high volume pumps. The county has seen nearly two and half times the amount of rain which normally falls in a month, although the weather situation is improved today and tomorrow.\u201d While Monday was forecast to be dry, the Met Office has yellow weather warnings in place for thunderstorms in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Met Office said: \u201cThunderstorms may develop, bringing torrential rain, hail and lighting to a few places, with potential disruption to travel and flooding. \u201cThere is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from flood water, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
