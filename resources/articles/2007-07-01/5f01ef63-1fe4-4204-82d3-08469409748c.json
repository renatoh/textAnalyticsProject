The Manchester United manager yesterday took an dig at his rivals Jose Mourinho and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the managers of Chelsea and Arsenal, who have been forced to play second fiddle to United and Liverpool in the transfer market. \"I thought there would be more spending,\" said Ferguson, sitting alongside Owen Hargreaves, his \u00a317m investment from Bayern Munich and Nani, who cost a combined \u00a330m when joining from Sporting Lisbon along with Porto's Anderson. That was without his intended investment in Carlos Tevez, with Ferguson saying United were on the brink of completing a deal for the Argentinian striker. \"There is a lot of money in the Premier League because of the television so I probably expected more to be spent. The thing about doing the business with two young players like Nani and Anderson is great timing for us. They won't play every game next season, but they will play a lot of games and it gives us a future.\" Ferguson also took the opportunity describe his squad for next season as one of the best in Europe and said that no one in the side was \"untouchable\", an apparent reference to Mourinho's comment last December that nine of his first team were \"untouchables\" who could not be dropped. \"In the 90s we rotated our squad very well,\" he added. \"Last season we were involved in the three tournaments - the final of the FA Cup, the semi-final of the European Cup as well as the league. \"We had a great opportunity [to win the treble] but we just didn't have enough bodies to stretch our squad out and save legs where we could have saved legs. In that situation I sort of regretted allowing the young players to stay out on loan. \"If I had been selfish and kept them we would have had a far better chance of getting to the final of the European Cup and a good chance of winning the FA Cup.\" He insisted, though, that none of his players could be guaranteed a place. \"No one will play all the games next year and hopefully they accept that and move on to the business of trying to achieve success for us.\" Ferguson said that negotiations had been taking place with Tevez over the past month with United believed to have agreed to pay \u00a36m for a loan deal over two years plus wages of \u00a390,000-a-week, with an option to buy the player outright for \u00a320m in 2009. The Premier League has said any money from the deal must go to West Ham although United had expected to pay the money to Kia Joorabchian and the two companies that had brought Tevez to England, Media Sports Investments and Just Sports Inc. The Premier League yesterday said it had not heard from either West Ham or Joorabchian. Tevez is currently involved in the Copa America. Ferguson said United were following the example set by Liverpool when they signed Tevez's compatriot Javier Mascherano from West Ham on an 18-month loan at the end of which they have the option to buy the player permanently. \"We followed that procedure set by Liverpool, but I thought it would have all been sorted by the weekend just gone. It must be the Premier League that is holding it up.\" He added: \"I don't know the intricacies about it, I've left that to Maurice Watkins, the club solicitor. He's dealing with that, but I'm sure that the outcome will be that we will be taking him with complete transparency in the deal, with no suspicions and nothing dodgy about it. \"There is no way that we can be involved in anything underhand at all and Maurice has been working on it for a month, maybe more, to make sure the deal is perfectly clear as far as we are concerned and that we take him with no side issues to it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
