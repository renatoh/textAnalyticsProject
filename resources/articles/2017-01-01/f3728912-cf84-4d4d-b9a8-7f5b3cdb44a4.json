The technology uses an algorithm to run a chat service that will search a database of symptoms, before advising whether to see a GP, go to hospital, visit a pharmacy or stay at home. NHS 111 is designed as an alternative to the NHS\u2019s non-emergency 111 helpline, which has seen an increase in demand from 2m to 15m calls a year in four years. But concerns have been expressed that the introduction of the app targets a symptom, rather than the cause, of the pressure on NHS services. \u201cWhilst it\u2019s always important to maximise use of technology to empower patients and make efficient use of NHS resources, this initiative does not address the fundamental problem that we have a severe shortage of GPs and health professionals in community settings,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association GP committee chairman. He said the app would rely \u201cslavishly\u201d on algorithms, rather than on clinical staff, which would leave no room for \u201cclinical interpretation in certain instances\u201d. \u201cThis proposal does not address this fundamental limitation and may make the situation worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we should instead be doing is investing in having properly trained and appropriate clinical staff handling calls and requests from patients, complementing the use of new technologies.\u201d The six-month trial, beginning this month, will be available to north London residents in Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Haringey and Islington. Patients can choose to continue using the 111 helpline. Clinical commissioning groups have worked with technology firm Babylon to trial the app. Adam Duncan, the chief operating officer at GPs\u2019 out-of-hours cooperative London Central and West, said the body was \u201chappy to be working with NHS England and the other providers involved to ensure the piloting of the NHS 111 app is evaluated robustly\u201d. He said: \u201cWe aim to provide an alternative to using the NHS 111 telephone number for service users that would find it most convenient to their lifestyle. The use of the app could also reduce the demand on NHS 111 during the most busy periods, whilst retaining the high quality and accessible service.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
