Here's your chance to prolong the euphoria. UB40, whose version of Swing Low is the squad's official anthem, are playing two sold-out nights at Wembley Arena on Wednesday 3 and Thursday 4 December. As well as the chance to hear some of the many hits that have kept the Birmingham band in the charts for over 20 years, the guys will be showcasing tracks from their new record Homegrown, an \"old-fashioned UB40 album\", according to guitarist Robin Campbell. The reggae legends will be joined by special guests, the also legendary Stranglers. It just doesn't get any better than that, does it? We have three pairs of tickets to Wednesday night's Wembley gig to give away. Email your name and a phone number where we can reach you to arts.competitions@guardianunlimited.co.uk and we'll select three winners by 1pm on Tuesday. Please note winners only will be contacted. The prize does not include transport or accommodation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
