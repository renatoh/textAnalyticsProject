In what appears to be a damaging breakdown in relations, headteachers say they are facing some of the most significant challenges of their professional lives but feel they are \u201cworking in isolation\u201d, unsupported by the government. School leaders, who are still picking up the pieces after the recent exams fiasco, say their confidence in government has been \u201csignificantly knocked\u201d. They are calling for urgent changes to current ways of working to help ensure a safe return to school. The intervention by the Worth Less? lobbying group, which represents thousands of headteachers across 75 local authorities from Cumbria to Cornwall, came as Boris Johnson said it was a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to get children back into education after five months of absence. The prime minister, who was criticised for keeping a low profile as the A-levels fiasco unfolded, insisted that the risk of contracting coronavirus in school was low and that it was damaging for children to stay out of education for any longer. The success of the prime minister\u2019s campaign will, however, depend on headteachers, who say they are not listened to and are not trusted by the government. Instead of meaningful collaboration, the letter says school leaders are at the mercy of ever shifting policy directives and \u201cmyriad changes\u201d. \u201cIn a time of unprecedented challenge, we need some clarity and purpose,\u201d said Jules White, head of Tanbridge House school in Horsham, West Sussex, and the leader of Worth Less?, which cut its campaigning teeth on school funding and organised a headteachers\u2019 march on Downing Street to press for more money. White said: \u201cThe majority of heads feel let down by the Department for Education and indeed Ofqual [the exams regulator in England]. Whilst we support the government\u2019s aspirations to get every child back to school safely, heads require more than just vague words to deliver effectively for every child.\u201d School leaders who signed up to the letter described recent events as \u201cfarcical\u201d and variously expressed anger, frustration and anxiety about how the government has handled the response to Covid on schools and plans for reopening in September. Their letter is also disparaging about assumptions that, once opened, schools will be able to carry on as before. \u201cThe pandemic has already created far-reaching problems for many children,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe notion that schools will find a \u2018new normal\u2019 that allows provision to simply carry on as before is unhelpful in the extreme. New priorities have emerged and they will need to be tackled quickly and effectively.\u201d As the clock ticks down to the start of the academic year, the letter lists a series of headteachers\u2019 pressing concerns, including fears about whether there will be sufficient resources to support children\u2019s mental health. Worth Less? is also concerned about unrealistic expectations for next year\u2019s exams. The government and Ofqual have made a number of modest changes to GCSEs and A-levels due to be taken in 2021, but teachers say they do not go nearly far enough and would like a radical rethink. Headteachers have also expressed fears about the lack of contingency planning for short-term school closures and local lockdowns in response to infection outbreaks. Downing Street admitted on Monday that schools could be forced to close again if stricter local lockdown measures are needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and teachers must prepare remote learning for pupils. \u201cThe complexity of the challenges that lie ahead must not \u2026 be underestimated,\u201d the letter states, \u201cand if children and their families are to be most effectively served, urgent improvements to current ways of working are required. \u201cAs headteachers face some of the most important challenges of our professional lives, all too often we feel that we are working in isolation from government rather than in harmony with our political masters. \u201cCollaboration, consultation and partnership have felt in short supply and this caused immense frustration as time, energy and resources have been wasted by headteachers as we respond to shifting policy directives and myriad changes.\u201d Pupils in England and Wales are due to return to schools from next week, following Northern Ireland, where children began the new term on Monday, and Scotland, where pupils have been back at school for a fortnight. In one Dundee special school, 17 teachers and two pupils tested positive for Covid. The DfE has been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
