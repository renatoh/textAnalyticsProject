But the Test call-up feels even more incredible.\" We first met at The Oval last Thursday, when Morgan was still lost in the jubilation of winning the World Cup the previous weekend and trying to motivate himself for a Clydesdale Bank 40 group match between Middlesex and the Netherlands in Amsterdam three days later. It was striking then that Morgan should stress how much he prized Test cricket over the Twenty20 and 50\u2011over formats in which he has made his name this past year. But he appeared equally realistic when arguing that his only chance of forcing himself into England's Test side was \"through sheer weight of runs in county cricket\". Now, however, in sparkling sunshine at Lord's, he can hardly believe what has happened. \"I was at home in Finchley on Saturday morning and I got a call from Geoff Miller [England's chairman of selectors]. When I saw his name on my phone I thought he was checking something routine. But he then said: 'I've got some good news for you.' I was thinking, 'What could that be?' I didn't have a clue.\" Who was the first person to hear from Morgan that he is set to become a Test cricketer this week \u2013 despite not having played a first class match for nine months? \"I told my best friend, Sean from Liverpool, who was in the house when I got the call. He was as gob-smacked as me \u2013 utterly delighted but really surprised.\" Morgan makes it sound as if there is no comparison between the weighty significance he attaches to Test cricket and the more fleeting exuberance of being a Twenty20 World Cup winner. \"It's huge for me,\" he says of his dizzying elevation. \"Even more than making it in Twenty20 or 50\u2011over cricket my real ambition has been to become a Test player. For me Test cricket is the ultimate. It's very rare that you get a chance to play in a Test and that's what makes it so special and prestigious.\" It is also uniquely challenging and the conundrum surrounding Morgan's selection is whether his icy temperament and ingenious batting can overcome his paucity of experience and success outside limited-over cricket. In some ways his remarkable eye and bold innovations at the crease are reminiscent of the methods that propelled Kevin Pietersen into the Test arena just before the 2005 Ashes. But Pietersen had already played some substantial longer innings and his talent was forged in South African cricket. Morgan's past is much more idiosyncratic. His entire career has also been channelled into developing an aptitude for one-day cricket. As a consequence he has often struggled in the four-day game, even in the second division of county cricket with Middlesex. Last season was notably disappointing. \"I did battle and felt a bit low,\" Morgan concedes. \"We were struggling as a team and that didn't help. But I don't think I was mentally well-prepared enough. The only high point was when I got 140 against Northampton.\" He averages 36 in first\u2011class cricket, after 48 games, a modest record that would normally not have brought him anywhere near Test consideration. His World Cup excursions, and before that his stint in the Indian Premier League, mean that Morgan's most recent first-class match was against Glamorgan last August \u2013 when he scored 16 and 17. How can he compensate for that lack of four-day cricket? \"I don't think it will be a problem. I feel really good about my game and I'm in a great place mentally. I'm still only in a 12-man squad but, if I play, I think it will be important to keep it simple and stick to a plan. I can't get carried away.\" Morgan has played some innings whose brilliance and tenacity should not be disparaged just because they unfolded in a limited-overs format. Anyone who saw him score 85 off 45 balls against South Africa at the Wanderers last November would not have been surprised that he used the same audacious technique against the seriously quick Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel when driving England to another win in the World Cup. His most recent innings against Bangladesh might seem even more pertinent this week. In early March England were in danger in Dhaka, on a turning wicket and in front of 30,000 expectant Bangladeshi supporters, but Morgan responded with a masterly display. Holding his nerve and playing with precision and imagination, he hit a century which secured England a series victory that, until he arrived at the crease, looked unlikely. Even more impressively Morgan remained composed throughout and did not even celebrate his maiden century for England. \"I honestly didn't even know when I got my hundred,\" he says with a grin. \"The scoreboard was playing up and even the runs we needed to win weren't being updated. But I was so focused on what we needed it didn't matter.\" Morgan can resemble a whirring computer as he calculates the tightest of run chases; and it bodes well for his transition to Test cricket that he should be so deeply concentrated. Alongside Pietersen he was England's best batsman in the World Cup but Morgan highlights a cohesive team display. \"It's remarkable how we did it. We didn't just sneak over the line but we were in charge all the way through. It was only really against Ireland [in a rain-affected group game when England were saved by Morgan against many of his friends and former teammates] that we looked a little troubled. For the rest we were decisive and clear. \"It started from the moment we arrived in the West Indies and the first thing Andy Flower said to us was, 'We're here to win the World Cup \u2013 if we do anything less, we should be very disappointed.' And we believed him because we're a quality side. We weren't fazed by anything and we stuck to our game all the way to beating Australia convincingly in the final.\" It all sounds very un-English, especially when set against some calamitous collapses in the past. Last June Morgan made his Twenty20 debut for England in the opening match of the 2009 World Cup against the Netherlands at Lord's. England lost, disastrously, to the Dutch part-timers. \"It seems a hell of a long time ago,\" Morgan says. \"I scored six and wasn't picked again in that tournament. We were devastated \u2013 especially because we had been played off the park.\" What has happened over the past 11 months to turn England from a joke team in limited\u2011overs cricket to world champions? \"It's down to confidence. A lot of belief has grown \u2013 especially in our batting. We've tried to be positive and aggressive and some very good cricketers have been called into the side. But actually, in that last World Cup, we were quite unlucky to get knocked out. I think our bowling in that tournament was even better than in this month's World Cup. But we didn't have the confidence in our batting \u2013 or such a clear-cut strategy.\" England regained the Ashes last summer but their limitations in 50\u2011over cricket were exposed immediately afterwards \u2013 losing 6-1 to Australia in a series which marked Morgan's first sustained run in the team. \"It was humbling,\" he says. \"We were outplayed in all areas. We hit a massive low and there was only one way to go. But over the last seven months we've come a long way. The big turning point was in the Champions Trophy in South Africa when we beat some good teams and reached the semi-finals [last October]. You could feel the confidence growing and then in the winter we beat Pakistan, who were Twenty20 world champions, in Dubai. We started to believe we could beat anyone.\" Morgan confirms that England celebrated mightily the weekend before last but he also admits that \"mentally, the World Cup took a lot out of us. It was quite draining.\" England's Test team will be considerably fresher, and led by Andrew Strauss, Morgan's Middlesex team-mate, who had a restful winter. Morgan himself will be fuelled by adrenaline and his weariness after a heady 10 days should be easily overcome. \"It also helps that my family are coming over. They were on the edge of their seats watching the World Cup on television and they're totally chuffed.\" Morgan explains that his family have been playing cricket for four generations and that Rush, his home suburb in north Dublin, \"has always been mad about the game. I've never quite worked out why but people in Rush just like cricket. I was helped by the fact that my dad is a cricket fanatic and that my three brothers and two sisters all played. It's just part of our family.\" A Lord's Test debut will seem even more poignant for the 23-year-old. \"London has become a real home. I came to Middlesex nearly seven years ago and I remember my first year when I lived with an old lady in Finchley. She looked after me and gave me a home from home. I've never forgotten them fry-ups she made \u2013 the mushrooms were amazing. I've kept in touch and I know she'll have been following me in the papers. I've lived in Finchley ever since then and I just feel so happy here.\" On Thursday Morgan will be even more elated \u2013 and his determination to succeed could also make him England's most astute selection since Pietersen was picked to play ahead of Graham Thorpe in 2005. \"It's down to me now,\" Morgan says, before rushing away to join his Test team-mates. \"I want to prove that this is where I belong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
