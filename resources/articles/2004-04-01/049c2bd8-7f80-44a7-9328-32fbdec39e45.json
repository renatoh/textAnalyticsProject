Taylor, who spent three seasons at Bramall Lane before departing in 1998, rose unchallenged to head home Andy Reid's corner in the 74th minute. Scoring against the Blades has developed into something of a habit for Taylor. \"I always seem to score against them,\" he said. \"But it was especially nice to score in front of our supporters because they had some misgivings over the play-offs last season.\" During last season's play-off semi-final, Sheffield United recovered from a two-goal deficit to defeat Forest 4-3, but since then the vanquished side have swapped Premiership ambitions for thoughts of First Division survival. Taylor's fortunes, along with those of his strike partner Marlon King, who had put Forest ahead with a crisp shot mid-way through the first-half, have transformed since the arrival of Joe Kinnear in February. Under the previous manager Paul Hart the partnership had yielded just three goals; two months later and the total stands at 13, a run which has coincided with Forest pulling clear of the precarious position they occupied at the turn of the year. \"Before Joe came in things weren't looking good, but everyone in the team seems to be playing with a lot more confidence now,\" said Taylor. \"Personally, I feel the lads are playing a lot more to my strengths, we have been a lot more direct whereas before we were getting caught passing it at the back.\" It is ironic that the change in style many at the City Ground feared when Kinnear arrived is heralded as a reason for Forest's revival. Eyebrows were raised, and in some cases voices too when the former Wimbledon manager replaced Hart. The appointment of a manager with a penchant for more direct football was not what the purists at Forest had in mind. But following this latest victory, Forest's fifth in eight games, Kinnear can take some satisfaction from the manner in which he has answered his critics. \"There were certain people giving me a bit of caning before I got in the door, so maybe they'll eat humble pie before the season is over,\" said Kinnear. Sheffield United's manager Neil Warnock labelled his side's performance \"disappointing\", although he was able to take some succour from results elsewhere, which enabled them to hold on to the final play-off place. In terms of possession United were worthy of a point, but their prosaic attack was unable to break down an obdurate Forest defence. Even their goal had a touch of fortune, when Alan Wright's free-kick was deflected past Paul Gerrard to cancel out King's early strike.
