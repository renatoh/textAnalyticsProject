He appears and disappears behind the wall of the sheep pens as he stoops to select a charcoal-black lamb, then straightens to process it before stooping again to lower it gently to the ground and pick up the next bleating infant in turn. The processing is readying the lambs for life on Rosthwaite Fell, Thornythwaite Fell and Glaramara, eminences that are said to help trigger precipitation and partly account for nearby Seathwaite being, officially, the wettest spot in England. It's the same at most hill farms, whether at Gatesgarth in Buttermere, Knott Houses in Grasmere, Glencoyne by Ullswater or Middlefell Farm in Langdale: daubing of smitt (marking-fluid) on to the lambs' coats, snipping or punching of a lug mark to identify ownership of the animals (quite apart from the official ministry ear tag), squirting of a worming drench down their throats and spraying with a concoction to deter ticks and blowflies. This Borrowdale shepherd is no stranger to the rain's beat on his bare scalp, long used to enduring its incessant beat while gathering flocks from the fells or on his upland excursions in the purple vest of Borrowdale Fell Runners. One by one he hoists the lambs on to his knee as he works smitt into their coats with his fingers and deftly snips off the tips of their ears with his shears to identify each lamb as being of Thornythwaite stock. Individual lambs are passive in his grip, and once released give no more than a wriggle and a shake of the head before scampering off to join their bleating compatriots \u2013 about to be reunited with their mothers and introduced to their respective stamping grounds, or heafs, on high. Such is the occasion of lamb-marking that has long been part of the shepherd's calendar among the fells."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
