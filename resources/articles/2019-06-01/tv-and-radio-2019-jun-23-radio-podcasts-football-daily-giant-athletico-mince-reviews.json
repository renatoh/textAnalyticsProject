Not really, these days. But so what? You either like football or you don\u2019t, and those who aren\u2019t happy to be soccer-ists (yes, I made that up) are free to ignore its joys. For those who are interested, the Women\u2019s World Cup is proving to be exciting and disappointing and emotional and irritating, as World Cups always are, and 5 Live\u2019s regular football podcast, Football Daily, is all over it. 5 Live, and the BBC in general, has a well established approach to football coverage and these podcasts are, essentially, small radio shows. I don\u2019t mind this \u2013 I love 5 Live\u2019s sports programmes \u2013 but I do wonder, sometimes, when we\u2019re going to hear something different from one well qualified host and two, maybe three, knowledgeable guests giving their opinions on a football match that\u2019s happening soon or one that has just taken place. Anyway, the enthusiastic and excellent Caroline Barker is our host for Football Daily\u2019s WWC shows. On Tuesday she did exactly what she should have done, which was be outraged by that awful VAR-induced penalty retake in the France v Nigeria game. (All you need to know is that Nigeria were robbed. As were Scotland with another VAR horror on Wednesday.) After asking her compadres, magazine editor Jen O\u2019Neill and ex-player Lindsay Johnson, to make a noise that represented their outrage (a grumpy growl ensued), there was a 10-minute discussion in which everyone agreed, correctly, that the retake was a joke. This was exactly the discussion I expected to hear, and I would have been disappointed if it had been in any way different. Later, footballer-come-musician Chelcee Grimes, who\u2019s been filming at the World Cup, burbled for a bit, and there was also a chat with Abbie McManus, an England defender, plus analysis about how punters can get to feel closer to players (TV coverage is key). So: no massive new insights, nothing to make you fall off your chair, but then, this is football. Familiarity is what it\u2019s about. Back of the net, etc. If you fancy a new podcast that takes football a wee bit further, then Giant is a new six-part series from Spotify made in association with football magazine Mundial, which aims to give listeners the long soccer story rather than the immediate post-match reaction. Future episodes will tackle the story of Nigeria\u2019s gold medal in the 1996 Olympics, the decade-long rivalry between Man U and Arsenal, the story of AFC Wimbledon and the birth of Major League Soccer. There\u2019s also an episode called The Magnificent 7, about seven women footballers, one from each of the seven WWCs since 1991. All great subjects, I\u2019m sure soccer-ists will agree. (Especially those who remember the 1990s.) Giant\u2019s first episode, out this week, was an in-depth look at Ronaldo (not that one: the Brazilian Ronaldo, the chubby genius with the buck teeth) and his brief time at PSV Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. Presenter Owen Blackhurst was quickly into his stride and the story was told by the people that mattered: the players who were around Ronaldo when he arrived from Brazil as an unknown 17-year-old; the trainers; those who knew him at the time. And it was fascinating. Recommended, even if you don\u2019t really bother with football, just for the joy in everyone\u2019s voices when they talk about Ronaldo\u2019s talent. It would be remiss of me when I\u2019m discussing football shows not to mention Athletico Mince, the footy podcast that features Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson. With an episode out every two weeks, this is one of those shows that\u2019s all about regular listening. It\u2019s just a daft chat between two middle-aged men from the north-east about\u2026 well, supposedly about football, but it takes in anything and everything: quizzes; daytime telly; many, many semi-famous people. There\u2019s quite a lot of singing. If you like Viz and your favourite bits of Would I Lie to You are when Mortimer is on, you will love this show, soccer-ist or no. Three podcasts about threes These Three In which John Wilson, he of Radio 4\u2019s Front Row and Mastertapes, branches out into his own podcast. Wilson is a culture vulture of eminent standing, and his interviews are always informed and intimate. In this new show, launched last week, he talks to musicians, actors, directors and artists about three works: one they made, one they wish they\u2019d made, and one they\u2019re working on right now. The first interviewees are Hayley Atwell, Paul Weller, Kwame Kwei-Armah, Natalie Merchant, Tom Odell and Jonathan Yeo. Great idea, beautifully executed. Recommended. Rule of Three Joel Morris and Jason Hazeley are two very funny men. Writers of Cunk on Britain, creators of the brilliant Ladybird Books for Grown-Ups, they used to write for Viz, which is pretty much all you need to know. In this podcast they talk to comedians and writers about the comedy they love. So Charlie Brooker raves about Airplane, Katy Brand extols Red Dwarf, Sue Perkins gets frothy about This Is Spinal Tap, Kevin Eldon explains his love for the Rutles. Morris and Hazeley are lovely hosts, but it\u2019s the unpicking of how and why comedy works that makes this special. Three Things With Rick Elias Rick Elias survived an air crash. He then did a TED talk about it, in which he shared with the audience what three things he learned from this. Elias is a very successful businessman and self-described \u201clifelong learner\u201d who wants to learn from every conversation and experience (yes: exhausting). Here, he talks to \u201cworld-class CEOs\u201d, \u201chall of fame athletes\u201d, a Nobel prize winner, an astronaut and a Hindu priest. In each episode he summarises the three takeaway points listeners should get from his interviewees. You get the gist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
