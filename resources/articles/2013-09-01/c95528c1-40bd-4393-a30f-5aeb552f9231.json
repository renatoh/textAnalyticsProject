Uzbekistan failed to qualify automatically from Asia's Group A only because their goal difference was inferior by one to Korea's, and then outplayed Jordan for much of their two-legged qualifying play-off only for poor finishing and an outstanding second-leg performance from the Jordanian goalkeeper, Amer Shafi, to frustrate them. Then came a penalty shoot-out, Shafi excelled again and after the 20th penalty Uzbekistan's defeat was confirmed. Mirjalol Kasimov, having come that close to glory, instead announced his culpability for failure and his intention to resign as Uzbekistan manager. \"I accept responsibility and I will discuss with the management about my retirement from this post,\" he said. \"We did not achieve good results during these qualifiers. I think all the players gave their best on the field but now the national team needs to change.\" The lights did not go out only on Kasimov's international managerial career; they went out on the match itself, forcing an 18-minute delay to a scruffy, unremarkable game. \"Both teams had several chances to score and I think both Uzbekistan and Jordan deserve to continue towards the World Cup but we were luckier in this game,\" said the Jordan coach, Hossam Hassan. His side's next hurdle is a two-legged play-off against the fifth-best South American side that is not Brazil next month. They seemed quite happy about it. SB Balotelli: penalty king As long as there were no fireworks in his bathroom, Mario Balotelli could bet his house on scoring a penalty. Is there a better penalty-taker in the world? Surely not. He is so good that he even has a website dedicated to him . Balotelli's successful conversion for Italy in the 2-1 win over Czech Republic that secured their place at the World Cup was his 25th in 25 attempts for club and country, a remarkable demonstration of nerve from a man who is not exactly famous for keeping his cool. Part of what makes Balotelli's penalties so brilliant is the sheer nonchalance. He does not blast them, he strokes them in a style reminiscent of Eric Cantona, allowing himself a crucial split-second to wait for the goalkeeper to move before placing the ball in the opposite corner. There is not even any point trying to put him off. When Manchester City won a late penalty against Borussia Dortmund last season, Roman Weidenfeller, the Dortmund goalkeeper, tried some mind games with Balotelli, whispering in his ear before the penalty. Balotelli stayed impassive, stepped up and scored. \"He is a smart dog who couldn't be influenced by me,\" the German admitted. JS Passing the buck Here are some passing statistics from last night's games: Germany attempted 848 passes and were successful with 91.75%. France attempted 650, with an 86.92% success rate. Holland managed 646, 87% of them successful. Italy tried 625 passes, 89.76% of them finding their target. England tried 351, of which 73.79% were good. But then it is easy to beef up passing completion statistics by knocking the ball about in unthreatening areas \u2013 England's passing accuracy in their own half, at 90.32%, was lower than the other European giants', but in the same ball park. It is what happens in their opponents' half that is telling. Germany 91.27% Italy 85.88% Holland 83.91% France 82.96% England 60.71% England's overall possession percentage of 46.59% was their lowest of this qualifying campaign by nearly 10% (they had 55.39% in Montenegro in March, 57.49% in Moldova, 57.72% in Poland, 61.58% at home to Ukraine and 68.33% at home to Moldova \u2013 games against San Marino do not really count). Roy Hodgson thought it was \"a good performance\" and, while the avoidance of defeat away to the world's 28th-best footballing nation, according to Fifa's latest rankings, can hardly be considered disastrous, it would be best to save even the mildest superlatives for another occasion. SB Centurions Talking of England, Frank Lampard of course won his 100th cap in Ukraine, the culmination of several weeks of anticipatory blather. \"It's a fantastic occasion for Frank,\" said Steven Gerrard, in advance. \"I'll be very proud if I get on the pitch,\" said Lampard. As it happens, the Egypt striker Mohamed Abou Treika reached the same milestone on the same evening and got two assists and a goal in the 4-2 victory over Guinea that saw the world's last remaining 100% qualifying record extended (and former Wigan favourite Amr Zaki score his first international goal for four years). It is fair to say, though, that Treika's achievement received considerably less hype. \"Really? I didn't know at all that it was my 100th international match,\" he said. \"I really cannot believe it is true. I thought I had a long wait to achieve such a feat. It's a great feeling.\" Brighton's Adam El-Abd, meanwhile, had a less great feeling when he marked his full debut with a particularly hapless own-goal. Undaunted, he was also at fault for Guinea's second. SB Cavani sparks Uruguay revival Uruguay made a miserable start to their qualifying campaign but they are building momentum at a furious rate now. From a seemingly hopeless position they have salvaged their chances of reaching the World Cup and might not even have to rely on a play-off if they can beat Ecuador next month. Uruguay are level on points with Ecuador, whose superior goal difference means they are hanging on to the final and fourth automatic qualifying place after their 1-1 draw with Bolivia. But Uruguay's 2-0 victory in a difficult match against Colombia, who are second, could be pivotal. While Radamel Falcao's finishing for Colombia was uncharacteristically wayward, Edinson Cavani kept his composure at the crucial moment, breaking the deadlock in the 77th minute to maintain Uruguay's revival. JS Sweden and Kazakhstan go for it There might not have been many goals but there could be no questioning either side's commitment to attack in Astana, where Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the only goal of the game with what Reuters called \"a lightning counter-attack\". Given that the goal came after 27 seconds, one can only imagine how fast Kazakhstan's original attack had been. SB Luxembourg's wait is over Forty-one years of Luxembourgian hurt is finally over. At long last they can celebrate a victory in a World Cup qualifier, their first since 1972 and only the fourth in their entire history. Few people could have seen their 3-2 win over Northern Ireland coming, even though they had managed three draws in Group F. But Luxembourg were well worth a victory, which was sealed by Mathias Janisch in the 87th minute. However for Northern Ireland, there was little consolation in playing a minor part in history. After beating Russia last month and performing creditably last Friday against Portugal, who needed a hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo, this was a harrowing defeat and one which left Michael O'Neill fuming, not least because it is hardly likely to spark a run of victories from Luxembourg. JS France and San Marino end their drought Two remarkable scoring droughts came to an end, with France finally putting theirs behind them after 527 minutes when Franck Rib\u00e9ry won and scored a penalty against Belarus \u2013 the French were to add three more before the night was out. Meanwhile at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle, Alessandro Della Valle scored San Marino's first goal for five long, hard, goal-drought-blighted years, a very fine and wildly celebrated header that brought them level against Poland. They ended up losing 5-1 in a match otherwise remarkable mainly because 15, or 37.5%, of the 40 players selected for active duty by the two sides had surnames that begin with the letters B or C. It could be that nobody else has remarked on that. SB Goalkeeping blunders Talking of France, Hugo Lloris submitted a very decent entry in the goalkeeping-howler-of-the-day competition when letting Timofei Kalachev's innocuous 30-yard shot fly into the net when, had he stood still, it would have bounced off his shoulder to safety. Sadly Lloris was denied victory by Jamaica's Richard McCallum, playing against Costa Rica, who not only under-hit a pass out of his penalty area sufficiently for a forward to intercept the ball but then allowed himself to get badly caught out at his near post for good measure. Talking of the north and central America qualifiers, here is a nice volleyed goal from Panama's Gabriel Torres. SB Anya stars for Scotland Ikechi Anya scored his first goal for Scotland in their 2-1 win against Macedonia, to burnish further one of the more unlikely footballing rises. Given a debut at Wycombe by Tony Adams aged 16, he failed to fulfil his early promise and slipped out of league football, playing for Oxford City and Halesowen Town. A visit to the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain resurrected his career and earned him a contract with Northampton but he started only six games there before moving to Spain where he spent one season with Seville \u2013 no first-team appearances \u2013 and one with Celta Vigo, playing seven minutes, before signing for Granada, who immediately loaned him out for the season, to C\u00e1diz in the Segunda B. Finally last summer he moved to Watford and flourished. At the age of 25 he has started precisely 30 English league games, spread across eight years and three divisions, as well as spells in non-league and a couple of divisions of Spanish league football. His Nigeria-born father, Chinasa, has a doctorate in metallurgy and has worked for Oxford University; his Romania-born mother is an economist and his brother is a GP with a sideline as a rapper. \"I'm not your average footballer,\" he told The Independent last month, and he was not kidding.
