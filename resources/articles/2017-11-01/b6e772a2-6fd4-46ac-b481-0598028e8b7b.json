Asked on ESPN Friday about Trump\u2019s role in getting his son and two other players home, Ball said, \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cWhat was he over there for? Don\u2019t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out,\u201d Ball said. In response to an American father being \u201cunaccepting of what I did for his son\u201d, Trump tweeted that he should have left the three college students in jail in China. Trump had previously tweeted that he wondered if the three players would thank him, saying that they \u201cwere headed for 10 years in jail!\u201d Although the three players, LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, were detained and questioned by police, they were never actually put in jail. Upon returning to the US, they were suspended indefinitely from the UCLA team. At a press conference this week, the players apologized and thanked the president. \u201cA lot of people like to say a lot of things that they thought happened over there,\u201d Ball had said on ESPN Friday. He defended his son, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses. My son has built up enough character that one bad decision doesn\u2019t define him.\u201d Ball is known for promoting his children\u2019s careers: his eldest son, Lonzo, was drafted No2 overall by the LA Lakers this year. Rather than sign a multimillion-dollar contract with Nike, Adidas or Under Armour, LaVar released Lonzo\u2019s signature shoe through his Big Baller Brand, with the sneakers retailing at up to $495. Trump\u2019s social media director, Dan Scavino, attacked Ball for those remarks on Saturday, tweeting on his personal account, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for President @realDonaldTrump, his son would be in China for a long, long, long time!\u201d The president\u2019s Twitter feed followed with a tweet criticizing Ball early on Sunday afternoon. Trump has previously used his Twitter account to attack black athletes who protested about police brutality against black Americans by kneeling during the national anthem. Last month, Trump used his official account to attack ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill, a prominent black sports commenter who has called the president a \u201cbigot\u201d and \u201ca white supremacist\u201d. \u201cWith Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have \u2018tanked,\u2019 in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!\u201d the president tweeted. The White House press secretary had previously called on Hill to be fired for her criticism of the president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
