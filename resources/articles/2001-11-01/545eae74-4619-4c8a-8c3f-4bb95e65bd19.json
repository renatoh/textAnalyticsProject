The talks in the Gulf state of Qatar have taken on even more urgency since the September 11 attacks on the US. The world economy was already slowing, but the atrocities have almost certainly tipped the US, the world's economic locomotive, into recession. The World Trade Organisation, which has organised the talks, argues that more trade is vital to restore confidence. What is the WTO? It is the successor organisation to the general agreement on tariffs and trade, which was formed after the second world war. The WTO has greater authority than GATT to resolve trade disputes, but has to operate on consensus, which means that any of the 142 member countries can block agreement. Expect a lot of horse-trading and arm-twisting during the five-day meeting. Will Doha be any more successful than Seattle? The negotiations in riot-ridden Seattle collapsed when developing countries walked out after accusing the industrialised countries of failing to open their markets to clothing and food - the most important exports from poor countries. That issue still has to be resolved. Do the developing countries have a case? The World Bank thinks so. A recent study faulted wealthy countries for refusing to drop barriers to developing country exports. According to the Bank, rich countries spend $1bn (\u00a3685m) a day on agricultural subsidies - more than six times the amount they provide in development aid. The US excludes high quality lemons from debt-stricken Argentina to protect farmers in California and Florida. North Africa has problems selling tomatoes and citrus products to the EU because it wants to shelter its farmers. Will the US and the EU be more forthcoming this time? They have said that the new round will focus on the interests of the world's poorest countries, but India and other poorer countries condemned a draft declaration as containing little of interest to them. Developing countries refused to endorse the draft at the WTO's general council meeting in Geneva just before Doha. What do the industrialised countries want? Different groups want different things. The EU favours a broad trade round that includes global investment and competition rules so it can tell its farming lobbies that it has won concessions in return for cuts in massive agricultural subsidies. What is the US looking for? The big prize for the US - and the EU for that matter - is the liberalisation of trade in services. This could allow private sector companies unfettered access to public services in transport and utilities. US insurance groups and healthcare companies have been lobbying hard to open up education and health as well. The EU may be prepared to reduce agricultural subsidies if what's known as the general agreement on trade in services treaty (Gats) gets approved. What are the other potential deal breakers? The most contentious issue is access to life-saving drugs. Drugs are protected by 20-year patents under the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights treaty, or Trips. Developing countries want a clear statement that patents can be overridden in the interests of public health - the Aids crisis in South Africa being a case in point. Who opposes a watering down of Trips? The US, the UK and Germany because of their strong pharmaceutical lobbies. But the US may have weakened its hand when it threatened to break the patent on the main anti-anthrax drug, Cipro, made by the German drug giant, Bayer, in order to force the price down. Have anti-globalisation protesters turned up in Doha? Very few. Demonstrators have been largely kept out of Qatar because of strict visa regulations. But anti-WTO events in cities throughout the world are planned during the conference. Is China about to become a new WTO member? The WTO plans to approve the membership of China and Taiwan. China spent more than 15 years negotiating its terms of membership. Its arrival in the WTO means it will have to abide by international rules for conducting trade, but it will benefit from receiving the same trading terms as other members."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
