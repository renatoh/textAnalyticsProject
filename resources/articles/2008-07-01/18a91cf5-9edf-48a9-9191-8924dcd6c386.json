It evolved from the need to reduce the often extortionate transmission charges for messages sent from far-flung trouble spots in which foreign correspondents frequently found themselves. By agreement with the cable companies, reporters were allowed to incorporate unchargeable Latin and other appendages to normal words - \"Delhiwards soonest funds lowest opposition unawarest.\" At the height of the 1960s Congo crisis, or so the story goes, a legendary message clattered into the Daily Express's Fleet Street office. With all other European reporters fleeing the mounting chaos, the Express man was ordered to stay. His response was admirably economical: \"upstick job arsewards\". Harold Jackson, Woolpit, Suffolk My father was a teleprinter operator in the 1920s and 30s and, long after teleprinters had been abandoned by the Post Office and he had retired, he used telegraphese in his personal correspondence. He usually started his letters to me \"Thx for yr ltr\" and ended them with \"bibi\". Brian Read, Henley-on-Thames Let's hear it for biography One reason for the supposed \"death of life-writing\" (June 28) is its identification with a narrow historical rather than creative or literary perspective, so that its \"life\" has been squeezed out. As Kathryn Hughes argues, in these post-postmodern times we have moved beyond the need for the finely detailed lives of the supposedly great and good. What is more exciting is the worldwide growth in life-writing in its broadest sense, taking in not only the conventional auto/biographical forms but also blogs, social networking, \"autofiction\" and case histories, and themes such as identity, nationality and migration, illness and disability, prison, war and travel. Never has so much been written, and so accessibly, about people's lives. And yet when I visited a group of students and alumni of one life-writing programme, the question everyone was asking of each other (yet no one was willing to answer for fear of having their subject \"stolen\") was not \"What are you doing?\" but \"Who are you doing?\" Perhaps it is not just the publishers but also some of the academic creative and life-writing programmes that need to catch up. Adrian Ward, London What happened at Grunwick? In his review of Crisis? What Crisis? (\"Children of the revolution\", July 5), Francis Beckett states that the trades unions failed to defend the rights of workers at the Grunwick photo-processing plant. This is unfair on all the rank-and-file members who attended the many mass pickets and experienced police abuse at the Grunwick works. The dispute could most certainly have been won, had it not been for the fainthearted union leaders who failed to press home their advantage over the police cordon that protected the factory and its handful of strikebreakers. On the day that the miners arrived to lend their muscle to the picket, the picket leaders decided - on the suggestion of the police - to take the demonstrators on an irrelevant march through the streets of Brent. One of those who took this decision was Jack Dromey, at that time secretary of Brent Trades Council. Today he is best known as treasurer of the Labour party. Bill Geddes, Worthing Last sentences I enjoyed \"Ten of the best: Last sentences\" (July 5), but the ending of Wuthering Heights is only a \"solace\" for Lockwood himself, trapped to the last in his verbose complacency. Emily Bront\u00eb's final sentence is problematic rather than reassuring: Lockwood has learned nothing whatever. Bront\u00eb's ultimate exposure of him is as someone who would appropriate and gentrify death while conveniently forgetting the violence that preceded it. Those closing words are as radical as anything else in the novel. Nicholas Jardine, Broxbourne, Hertfordshire I recently reread Jean Rhys's bleakly feminist novel After Leaving Mr Mackenzie, and offer up its closing sentences as among the best in recent fiction. The novel is set in the 1920s in Paris, where Julia, the protagonist, has just left her lover and benefactor, Mr Mackenzie. She is alone, poor and losing her looks. How evocatively these lines convey her solitariness as she steps out into the Parisian evening: \"The street was cool and full of grey shadows. Lights were beginning to come out in the cafes. It was the hour between dog and wolf, as they say.\" Jenny Falloon, Swanage, Dorset \u00b7 Send letters to Review, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. review@theguardian.com Letters may be edited for reasons of space Please include a postal address."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
