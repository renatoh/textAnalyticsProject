Chelsea's midfielder is believed to have verbally agreed with Mourinho last year that he would retire from international football after this summer's World Cup but will now continue with France, whose opening Euro 2008 qualifiers come against Georgia on Saturday and Italy next Wednesday. Makelele's call-up was described by Mourinho as going against the player's will, and Chelsea have said they will talk to the French Football Federation about allowing the 33-year-old to call time on his international career. It was assumed Makelele would concentrate on Chelsea after the World Cup, having initially stepped down from internationals in 2004 before being tempted back with Zinedine Zidane and Lilian Thuram. However, Makelele disputed that he was being treated like a slave by France's coach, Raymond Domenech. \"My coach's [Mourinho's] words are a bit too strong, he's probably gone too far,\" he said. \"But his disappointment is logical. There was an agreement after the World Cup that I would retire. But I spoke with the French team coach and he believes I am still able to bring something extra to the team. I don't blame him [Raymond Domenech] for anything and I will go back and play with France. \"This is a delicate situation because I will play more matches and I will be more tired, but I am in the list and I have to go. The French team is still something important for me. Everyone knows me and I am a professional, I do my job and even if my club is not happy I will honour my call-ups.\" Mourinho has said Makelele had to accept the call-up, claiming for every France game the midfielder refused to play in, he would be forced to miss two Chelsea matches. A similar threat was first raised by Domenech but in fact Fifa's regulations merely state that a refusenik international cannot turn out for his club during the period of the release or for five days afterwards. \"There is no Fifa rule to prevent any player stopping his international career, that's up to him,\" a spokesman for world football's governing body said. \"The one thing that has to be considered is that the intention to leave a national team or put an end to an international career needs to be communicated prior to a specific summons.\" Mourinho may want Makelele to explain to him why he has been persuaded to continue with France. \"We take these players but we don't have a knife against their necks,\" Domenech said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
