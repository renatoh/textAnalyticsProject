Set to take on both the iPod mini and the Samsung YH-820, the Zen Neeon features a 5GB hard disk in a unit that has dimensions of 8cm x 4.7cm x 1.6cm and weighs 75g. It is compatible with MP3 and WMA files (including copyright-protected ones) and boasts an FM radio, a microphone for voice recording and a line input so music can be transferred directly to the device from a CD player. Battery life is rated at about 16 hours. It will go on sale in the UK shortly and is expected to retail for about \u00a3140. www.creative.com Water music Due in shops any day now, the H2O Audio SV iMini (\u00a3115) turns your iPod mini into an underwater music player. The American see-through case works much like a camera case, and is cleverly designed to let you access all of the player's controls. Meanwhile, the supplied waterproof headphones slide alarmingly far up your ear canals to deliver decent sounds at depths of up to 3m. Waterproof cases for regular iPods are also available, as are neoprene armbands and swim belts, so you don't lose your 'Pod while you swim, surf or snorkel. For stockists, call Channel Dynamics on 0870 607 0540. www.h2oaudio.com Mobile phones Sea view You could be forgiven for not wanting to use your mobile phone while playing in the sea. Sadly, the new WaveCase waterproof housing for mobiles won't allow you to make voice calls or surf the web underwater. It does, however, enable cameraphone owners to take pictures of the deep. The casing, which is impervious to a depth of about 20 metres, also comes with a strap that hangs around your neck. The case works with any phone that is no larger than 110mm x 55mm x 22mm. It is available for \u20ac49.90 (\u00a333.80). www.wavecase.de/en/index.htm Low-key LG Following on from the launch of the feature-free easy-to-use Simply phone from Vodafone last week, LG has announced its own basic mobile aimed at technophobes, which is available via T-Mobile. The B2050, which LG is billing as a talk and text handset, is a very small upright phone with a 65k colour screen. There's no camera, Bluetooth or music player, but it does have Wap facilities, games and an alarm, all of which are controlled by a four-way rocker switch and large-ish buttons. It is on sale for \u00a339.99. www.tmobile.co.uk Hardware Eye pod Elgato's EyeTV Wonder was one of the hits at the Macworld expo in San Francisco earlier this year, but it has only just started rolling out to consumers. The palm-sized add-on may look rather ungainly - it certainly doesn't chime with Apple's dominant aesthetic - but it packs a powerful punch. Built as a plug-and-play device to let Mac users watch TV on their computer screens, the Wonder's built-in ATI processor takes the heat off your desktop system, allowing you to run live television easily alongside other applications. It has a friendly online TV guide, onscreen controls, and can record shows - although that is not its primary function. www.elgato.com Camcorders Diddy cam Sanyo has launched the latest in its series of flash memory-based camcorders. The Xacti C5 is smaller and lighter than its predecessor, the C. It also boasts more storage because of its 1GB Secure Digital card, which Sanyo claims can house an hour's worth of MPEG4 standard footage. The camera can take five-megapixel still images, plus it has a 2in LCD monitor, a digital image stabiliser and 5x optical and 12x digital zooms. It is available in silver, bronze or white and retails for about \u00a3500. www.sanyo.co.uk \u00b7 Contributions from Ashley Norris, Bobbie Johnson and Caramel Quin \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Online, send your emails to online.feedback@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
