That's the theory, anyway, though the last time it was put into practice These Animal Men manifestly failed to annihilate Take That. But with Atomic Kitten at number one again, the time is ripe for another try, and wielding the new broom are New York's Strokes and this brother-sister duo from Detroit. Any Carpenters comparisons sparked by Meg White's role as hyper-propulsive drummer (younger sibling Jack does everything else, from thwacking a bluesy guitar to sneering down the microphone) are discounted from the outset. It may be yesterday once more chez White, but it's a yesterday inhabited by their hometown's punk facilitators, Iggy Pop and the MC5. The watchwords are loud, simple and, as encapsulated in The Union Forever, fuzzily political: \"I'm not interested in goldmines, oilwells, shipping or real estate/ What would I like to have been? Everything you hate.\" The immediately striking thing about the Stripes is what a din two people can make. The nature of the music makes it easy to crank up the amps, with no subtleties to be lost in the process, but you'd still swear you were hearing a whole platoon of nerdy twentysomethings kicking around a blues-rock formula as old as the hills (but no less compelling for that). Even a cover of Jolene, which argued that a middle-class midwesterner can croon as wrenchingly as the song's Tennessean author, sounded huge. There's nothing stylish or cool about the Whites' way with a timeworn tune (and they're all timeworn, whether cover versions or originals from the new White Blood Cells album). They're no great shakes as performers, either, endorsing the unadorned stand-and-deliver method. And they know nothing of the British opinion that rockabilly, which reared its musty head on a riproaring Jack/Meg duet at the end, is the stuff of sad pub bands. Despite all that, they've become groovy enough for their tour to sell out. It can't be because anyone thinks they'll sweep away Atomic Kitten, not with their penchant for creaky blues adaptations. More likely, the simple self-belief that oozes from every window-rattling song speaks to the people. \u0095 White Stripes play the Rocket, Leeds (0113-244 3446), tonight, then tour."}, "isHosted": false}}}
