His pulverising force as a prop forward for the Warrington Wolves, and an unruly disciplinary record forged in Britain and Australia, suggests he should be a cartoon figure unable to grunt anything beyond \"I Yam What I Yam\". But, shrugging off the busted cheekbones and fractured eye-sockets he has suffered while smashing the opposition, Morley can discuss more than the nutritional benefits of eating spinach. He offers intriguing company whether describing a passion for Bob Dylan or his test of faith as a practising Catholic in a secular society. None of this would matter much without the iron-cast sporting pedigree the 32-year-old brings as the only Englishman to have won the Challenge Cup as well as a Grand Final in Super League and Australia's notably superior NRL. This Saturday, in another Challenge Cup final, he captains Warrington in pursuit of their first trophy in 35 years, against the Huddersfield Giants. Without the 'Big Four' \u2013 St Helens, Leeds, Wigan and Bradford \u2013 there is a real freshness to this Wembley final. And a contest between the perennial underachievers in Warrington and unheralded Huddersfield is made even more enticing by Morley's attempt to break yet another long drought for a famous old club. \"It's become my speciality,\" he chuckles, \"which is just as well because Warrington is a rugby league-mad town and they've been success-starved for too long. They last made a final 19 years ago and it was back in 1974 when they actually won the Challenge Cup. So it's been a long time between drinks. \"I was in a similar position with Leeds when they finally won the Challenge Cup in 1999. They hadn't won anything for 21 years and so that was a magical day. I did the same with the Sydney Roosters. They had gone 27 years without winning the NRL and it was incredible to be part of a team that finally won the Grand Final in 2002. So I like helping a club get the win their fans deserve. But Warrington will be special because they have been waiting far too long.\" Earlier this season, when Warrington were hammered 60\u20138 by Harlequins, the despair seemed consuming. The club had just replaced their new head coach, James Lowes, with Tony Smith, the Australian who was then in charge of England. Smith had been an outstanding coach at Leeds, winning the grand final in his last game in 2007. However, his second match at Warrington was that disastrous defeat against Harlequins. \"It was the lowest point of my career,\" Morley says. \"After our fifth game of the season, and our fifth consecutive loss, we were totally demoralised. It was a terrible day for the club.\" The trauma was epitomised by the reaction of Matt King, their Australia centre, who showed \"the finger\" to Warrington's travelling supporters when they barracked him. King eventually apologised and said he had reached \"breaking point\" after a difficult first year at Warrington. Ironically, five months later, in the Challenge Cup semi-final against Wigan, King's hat-trick ensured victory. \"We go to Mass together,\" Morley reveals, while celebrating King's recovery, \"and that definitely helped Matt through a tough period. I go most weeks with Matt to church and, especially on game days, it's amazing how thinking about more spiritual things clears your head.\" Morley's willingness to discuss his private faith typifies his candour. But he admits it is not easy when his regular church-attendance can be ridiculed. \"I've had it all my life. Kids took the mickey horribly when I was growing up. It was tough because my mum and dad made me go to church and I resented it. But then, at 16, they said, 'right, you can make up your own mind now'. I've carried on going ever since and every week I get something fresh from it. But these days you get frowned upon by society for going to church \u2013 which is a massive shame. I also think it's sad that in church today there are hardly any young people.\" He shakes his head ruefully. \"But it helps to go with Matt to church in Salford, right next door to where I grew up. Matt lives nearby with his girlfriend in Salford Quays. We like Warrington but Salford, being closer to Manchester city centre, is a bit flashier.\" Morley grins helplessly, as if to prove his religious belief does not preclude a taste for some big city glitz. \"I wouldn't say either me or Matt are devout like some of the Pacific Island boys. But it means a lot to us both.\" King has struggled to adjust to a new life in England, just as Morley did during his first season in Australia \u2013 when he was enticed to the Sydney Roosters eight years ago. \"I was only 23 and it was a big jolt. I always wanted to go to the NRL to prove myself but I thought it would be much later in my career. I came under a lot more scrutiny because it was big news in Australia having an England international playing permanently in the NRL. In my first week I did 15 big interviews and I was in shock. On top of that I had to adjust to new team-mates and a new country. My first year was not a total write-off but it was very difficult. I only got going in my second season.\" Morley spent six years in Sydney and, apart from helping the resurgent Roosters finally win the NRL he was a key member of the side that reached the Grand Final the next two seasons. \"To reach three Grand Finals in succession was a huge achievement. We won the first and I was overwhelmed because, having been written off as a Pommie bastard, I was gobsmacked to have all these Aussies shouting 'Go Morley'. But I soaked it all up the next two years.\" In proving that a British rugby league player could star in the NRL, Morley boosted the credibility of the game in this country. He eventually returned home when a four-year offer from Warrington proved irresistible. \"My partner, Clare Richards, is English and when our first child was due in February 2007 there was a big tug to have our son born back home. While the Roosters wanted me to stay they were only talking a year or two. Warrington offered security.\" The homecoming was dented by a shattering blow to Morley's right cheekbone. Thirty-seven minutes into his debut, Morley collided with Wigan's Eamon O'Carroll and ended up having surgery on his fractured eye-socket. \"It weren't great,\" Morley winces. \"I was out 11 weeks and in my next game I broke the cheekbone again. But it's gone much better since then.\" Morley describes the appointment of Smith as \"a real turning point. Tony's never negative, and he does praise us, but he always shows you where you could improve. He's more bothered by the performance \u2013 and if the performances are right then the results will come.\" The growing spirit at Warrington, Morley jokes, is not down to his personal cultural tastes. \"It's safe to say the boys won't let me anywhere near the sound-system. They've forbidden me because I'm a massive Bob Dylan fan and people just frown when I tell them that.\" His faith in Dylan, even more than the church, marks him out as a singular presence in the Warrington dressing-room. \"I love Chronicles,\" he says of Dylan's evocative autobiography. \"I love everything about the book \u2013 from the fact that he wrote it himself to the whole atmosphere. You can see why he was such a great lyricist. I can't wait for the next two volumes.\" When did Morley, a former apprentice electrician who has played professional rugby for 15 years, discover Dylan and start playing guitar himself? \"I went to the pub one day and a friend of mine got up and played this incredible song on guitar. It was Don't Think Twice, It's Alright by Dylan. I'd heard of him but I'd never listened to any Dylan before. I started buying everything I could and it just kept coming. Even now my collection is not complete and I've got 50 CDs. I also like Van Morrison and Neil Young, but Dylan's the man for me.\" The man for Warrington, meanwhile, is Morley. Apart from leading them to Wembley this Saturday his son, Leo, is one of the club's most distinctive fans. \"He's not yet three but he comes to all the games in his Mini Moz jersey and he sleeps with Wolfie the mascot every night. We might have another rugby player on our hands.\" Morley's second child is due in February and he is already planning for the future. \"I want to play as long as I can but I'm taking all my coaching badges and helping the under-16s here. I'm also doing my personal trainer badges because, as a realist, I know there are only so many coaching jobs. But I like to think with my experience I've got a lot to offer. I'm really proud of the fact I'm the only Englishmen to have won the Challenge Cup as well as Grand Finals here and in Australia. But it would mean even more if there was another trophy on Saturday \u2013 and Warrington went completely crazy for the first time in 35 years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
