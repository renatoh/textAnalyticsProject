Top stories The Liberal party has picked Dave Sharma to stand in Wentworth, the seat vacated by Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s resignation from parliament. Sharma \u2013 a former ambassador to Israel \u2013 beat seven other Liberal candidates in a marathon meeting that finished at 1.30am on Friday. Sharma defeated high-profile women, including Scott Morrison\u2019s pick for the job, Katherine O\u2019Regan. She was originally tipped to get the Liberal party nod after the frontrunner Andrew Bragg withdrew from the contest under mounting pressure from Canberra. Sharma will now face a tough byelection battle in October, with early polling indicating a big swing against the Liberals, who have never lost the seat. Whether the seat remains in Liberal hands may hinge on whether a high-profile independent, former AMA head Dr Kerryn Phelps now runs. Australia will miss its Paris climate targets as carbon emissions continue to soar, new data shows. The figures from NDEVR Environmental for the year up to June 2018 show that Australia will miss its Paris targets by around a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide if emissions continue on their current trajectory. It is the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions. Excluding land use, the emissions will tally 558m tonnes, the highest since records began in 2002. \u201cThe data\u2019s telling us clearly again that we\u2019re not on a trajectory to meet our targets,\u201d said NDEVR\u2019s Matt Drum, \u201cthere\u2019s no effective policy to meet our targets, but we\u2019re still hearing commentary from the government that we\u2019re on track to meet our targets.\u201d Donald Trump has made the extraordinary and demonstrably false claim that 3,000 people did not die in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, asserting in a tweet that the figure was dramatically increased by the Democrats \u201cin order to make me look as bad as possible\u201d. The official death toll from the Puerto Rican government was adjusted upwards, but following the release of a report from the George Washington University report that suggested the number of excess deaths was in the range of 2,658 to 3,290, not 64 as they had been reporting earlier. The mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, condemned Trump\u2019s tweet, saying it showed an \u201cappalling\u201d lack of respect, and concluding: \u201cSimply put: delusional, paranoid, and unhinged from any sense of reality. Trump is so vain he thinks this is about him. NO IT IS NOT.\u201d Billionaire Westfield founder Frank Lowy has used the annual address at the Lowy Institute to heavily condemn Australia\u2019s public discourse on immigration, the 87-year-old urging the nation to adopt \u201can ambitious migration program\u201d. One of Australia\u2019s best-known migrant stories, Lowy fled Nazi persecution as a child, before arriving in Australia in 1952 via Palestine and Israel. \u201cI have \u2026 been disturbed by the negative tone of the debate over immigration,\u201d said Lowy. \u201cThere is a rising crescendo of opinion from columnists and politicians, saying we should reduce our immigration intake\u201d, he said, warning that the nation should not forget the \u201copportunities of immigration\u201d while becoming fixated with perceived problems. France has warned that a no-deal Brexit could see trains and planes from the UK stopped, with the French minister for European affairs suggesting emergency legislation could be passed to protect its citizens. France is pushing for key negotiating issues to be resolved before a mooted 29 March, 2019 exit, rather than a \u201cblindfold Brexit\u201d. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, also warned the British cabinet on Thursday that the impact of a no-deal Brexit could be as catastrophic as the GFC in 2008, with unemployment reaching double figures and house prices falling by 25-35% over three years. Nearly two in every five women in the world who kill themselves are Indian, a Lancet study has found this week. With one-fifth of Indian women still marrying before the age of 15, experts blame the cultural practice of early marriage, as well as male violence against women, as strong contributing factors. \u201cOur social norms are very regressive,\u201d said public health director Poonam Muttreja. \u201cIn the village, a girl is called her father\u2019s daughter, then she is her husband\u2019s wife, and when she has a son, she is her son\u2019s mother.\u201d The researchers say the evidence presented amount to a \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d in the world\u2019s second-most populous nation. Sport It could be a case of \u201cthird time\u2019s a treat\u201d for the Greater Western Sydney Giants, as they face Collingwood in the AFL semi-final this weekend, where despite their tender years as a club, writes Craig Little, there\u2019s an ethic and a grit that fortifies their talent. Netball legend Sharni Layton has confirmed her switch to AFLW, signing with Collingwood for the 2019 season. The 46-cap Diamonds legend retired from the game in August, but the two-time Netball World Cup winner is expected to bring invaluable experience despite her relative rookie status in Aussie Rules. Thinking time \u201cChoosing a nursing home is never pleasant or easy. Most often, it is done in a crisis, when emotions are heightened by drama and urgency,\u201d writes Caroline Baum, as part of Guardian Australia\u2019s series about aged care. So what should you look for? According to Susan Jantos, an aged care specialist, isolation and loneliness shorten life span dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s important to choose a place that makes an effort to sustain residents emotionally. That includes cultural factors which preserve a sense of identity, like being able to eat the food you love or a d\u00e9cor that echoes places that mean something to you.\u201d See also Sarah Russell\u2019s article on the worrying over-prescription of psychotropic drugs to aged-care residents. The Go-Betweens have been the frontrunner on Guardian Australia\u2019s Songs of Brisbane poll with their track Streets of Your Town \u2013 but in a letter to the editor, Powderfinger\u2019s ex-drummer Jon Coghill is FURIOUS. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop listening to independent darlings the Go-Betweens can you? Are you serious? What happened to Savage Garden? Kate Miller-Heidke? The Veronicas? The Bee Gees? And what about Powderfinger?\u201d Nominations have closed and the leaderboard\u2019s gone dark, but you still have time to knock the Gobees off their top spot before the poll closes on Tuesday. A nine-year-old girl has been subjected to an extraordinary bullying campaign by Australian politicians and prominent media commentators, for the offence of refusing to stand for the national anthem in protest at its erasure of Australia\u2019s Indigenous history. As Van Badham writes, \u201cIt is beyond gross that the right\u2019s culture war has become so panicky and weak that adults are willing to abuse the power of their platforms to wage war on a single child \u2026 Their incessant, yawping demands for \u2018free speech\u2019 and \u2018individual rights\u2019 fall silent the moment anyone else exercises any. The right aren\u2019t rebels, they\u2019re apologists for privilege, a quality that eternally defines them.\u201d Media roundup Several leading mastheads including the Financial Review are leading with tumult inside the Coalition government, with Barnaby Joyce accusing Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop of leading a guerrilla campaign against Scott Morrison over the issue of Peter Dutton\u2019s referral to the high court. A damning investigation into the culture of the prestigious St Paul\u2019s College at Sydney University has handed down a 132-page report detailing booze and sex parties, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, including 50 recommendations to address what vice-chancellor Michael Spence had called a culture of \u201cdeep contempt for women\u201d. And, the Advertiser writes that a new football stadium in Adelaide is under consideration as part of Australia\u2019s bid to host the 2023 women\u2019s World Cup. The South Australian government has confirmed that it is studying the viability of hosting, but hasn\u2019t confirmed whether that includes plans for a new stadium. Coming up The financial services royal commission continues its hearings into the insurance industry. The official announcement of the winner of the Wagga Wagga byelection will take place this morning with likely political fallout for the NSW government.
