The Royals' attacking collective is reminiscent of the 2004-05 Wigan side and, as with the Latics, it is the unsung heroes who deserve much of the credit. With Wigan it was the then unheralded midfield of Jimmy Bullard, Gary Teale and Ian McCulloch; for Reading read James Harper, Glen Little and, in particular, Bobby Convey. The US winger scored one and flew at Wolves with such abandon that neither Rob Edwards nor his half-time replacement Maurice Ross could cope. Though Kenny Miller pulled a goal back for the visitors, who could have even snatched a late victory, Reading, largely through Convey's promptings, had the chances to be comfortable. As it is if Leeds fail to beat Crystal Palace tomorrow night, victory at Leicester at the weekend will see the Royals promoted. \"I'm not too nervous, although we know we've still got to get a few more points,\" said Convey. \"From a player's perspective to have 91 points and only two losses is pretty amazing and I think that the mentality that everyone has has been a key to the season - we want to finish the season off in a good way.\" Convey will meet up with the United States squad in Germany this week with Coppell's blessing, though he confirmed his manager may not have been so accommodating had Reading not enjoyed such a wide margin for error. Promotion and the World Cup will cap a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of Convey, who made only 18 league appearances last season - many of those as a substitute - but has played in every game this season and will be vying with PSV Eindhoven's DaMarcus Beasley for the US's left-wing berth this summer. \"For me it is a dream come true,\" he said. \"I'm 22 and to have a chance to help get my team promoted, go to the World Cup and play in the Premiership. I can't ask for any more. To represent your country is an amazing thing and to play against the best players in the world in the Premiership and the World Cup is something no one can ever take away from me.\" Though technically Leeds, Watford and Sheffield United can still take that Premiership dream away, in reality Reading have been racing certainties since before Christmas. Coppell refers to the famous Grand National faller Devon Loch in answers to questions on the subject and it would not be a surprise if he refuses to acknowledge Reading's top-flight status until things kick-off again in August. The club's fans may also be wary of counting their chickens - the memory of the 1994-95 season still looms large. That year, because of the restructuring of the Premiership, second place in the second tier was not enough for the Royals. Overcoming that disappointment Reading led 2-0 in the play-off final only to lose 4-3. The pain of those memories may finally be soothed in six days' time.
