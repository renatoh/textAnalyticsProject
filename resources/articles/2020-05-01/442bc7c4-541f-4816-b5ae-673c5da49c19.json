It was effectively a public debut for Kayleigh McEnany, whose immediate predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, never delivered a briefing in nine months in the role. Recently, Trump has turned daily coronavirus task force briefings into multi-hour back-and-forths with the press. Taking the lectern for the first time, McEnany stressed that she would be speaking on behalf of the president and the highest-ranking officials in his administration. \u201cI\u2019m around the president almost the entire day,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just with him before I left to come out and speak with you guys. \u201cI think my staff can attest to the fact that they have a very hard time finding me because I\u2019m normally with the president in the Oval Office. So I\u2019m consistently with him, absorbing his thinking, and it\u2019s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president, deliver those facts so this president gets fair and accurate reporting and the American people get fair and accurate information.\u201d McEnany was less outwardly combative than Trump. She did not accuse White House reporters of being or peddling \u201cfake news\u201d. Nor did she say any outlet had terrible ratings. Still, she repeated Trump\u2019s main arguments. Regarding the World Health Organization and its role in battling the coronavirus outbreak, for example, she said: \u201cThe WHO appears to clearly have a China bias. \u201cI mean, you look at this timeline and it\u2019s really damning for the WHO when you consider the fact that on 31 December you had Taiwanese officials warning about human-to-human transmission, the WHO did not make that public. \u201cOn 9 January, the WHO repeated China\u2019s claim that the virus does not transmit readily between people, that was quite apparently false. On 14 January, the WHO again repeated China\u2019s talking points about no human-to-human transmission.\u201d Under fire for his own administration\u2019s response to Covid-19, which as of Friday afternoon had infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more than 63,000, Trump has accused the WHO of slow-walking moves that could have prevented global spread. Earlier in April, he announced that his administration would halt funding to the organization, pending a review. McEnany\u2019s first briefing also landed on the day that Trump\u2019s all-but-certain general election opponent, the former vice-president Joe Biden, publicly responded to an allegation of sexual assault by a former Senate staffer. McEnany was asked about comments made by the president in an interview with a conservative radio host, that the allegation against Biden by Tara Reade was more credible than those made against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford or against Trump by numerous women. McEnany framed the accusations as old news that had been cleared up by Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election. \u201cHe has always told the truth on these issues,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s denied them immediately and you\u2019re bringing up issues \u2026 from four years ago that were asked and answered and the American people had their say in the matter when they elected President Trump as president of the United States. \u201cLeave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president [Biden] and turn it on the president and bring up accusations from four years ago that were asked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people.\u201d McEnany also discussed Michael Flynn, the first of Trump\u2019s four national security advisers who resigned after a brief spell in the role and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president has indicated a potential pardon for Flynn, who has not yet been sentenced. On the subject of recently unsealed investigative documents, McEnany was asked why she called the FBI investigation of Flynn a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d, given his guilty plea. Reporters, she answered, should more aggressively cover how the FBI handled the investigation. Again, the press secretary \u2013 who earlier promised \u201cnever\u201d to lie to reporters \u2013 sounded some of the same notes, in a the same tone, as Trump. \u201cDo you not consider it a miscarriage of justice when you have the FBI writing \u2018We want to get someone to lie?\u2019\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThe answer\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 and I encourage the media to cover it, because I\u2019ve watched a lot of your networks I\u2019ve read a lot of your papers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was a whole lot of speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40m of taxpayer money being lost, and the complete and total exoneration of President Trump.\u201d Most observers do not consider the special counsel Robert Mueller to have exonerated Trump in his investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Indeed, though he did not establish a criminal conspiracy or recommend charges of obstruction of justice, Mueller said he was not clearing the president. Trump and his allies have regularly claimed exoneration regardless. It is unclear how often McEnany will appear in the White House briefing room. Trump press secretaries had their appearances scaled back after the president decided they were doing an inadequate job. \u201cAs to the timing of the briefings, we do plan to do them,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cI will announce the timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these.\u201d Her first appearance had lasted about half an hour, well short of Trump\u2019s marathon sessions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
