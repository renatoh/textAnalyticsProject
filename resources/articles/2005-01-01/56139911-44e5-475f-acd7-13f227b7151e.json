The two parties traded blows on tax and spending at both PMQs and press conferences in the ongoing sparring ahead of the formal announcement of an election campaign. In the wake of the Tories' publication of their cost-cutting James review on Monday, which includes a recommendation to privatise job centres, Labour's Alan Milburn today joined forces with the work and pensions secretary, Alan Johnson, to defend the New Deal. Mr Johnson said: \"The proposals contained in the James review are dangerous. We estimate that their double whammy of scrapping the New Deal and privatising Jobcentre Plus will mean massive cuts in frontline services and less help to get people into work. \"Based on official estimates, we believe the impact of these combined cuts is an increase in unemployment by the fourth year of a Tory government of over 300,000. The savings they claim in the James review for work and pensions would be wiped out.\" At today's prime minister's question time, Tony Blair promised to pursue the Tories \"until polling day\" on their joint pledge to reduce government spending while improving public services. But Mr Blair refused to give an early guarantee that taxes would not rise if Labour was returned to power, insisting his plans would be revealed in the party's manifesto. The PM said the Tories would cut spending on regeneration, social housing and help for the unemployed. Mr Howard told him: \"You plan to do what you have always done, which is to put up taxes in the first budget after a general election. The prime minister, challenged later by a Tory backbencher to promise that the government would not raise taxes at all, said the chancellor would set out his plans in the budget and that Labour would lay out all its policy proposals before the election. He said: \"We will not make promises we cannot keep.\" Despite Labour's decision earlier this year not to hold daily press conferences during the election campaign, the party has organised briefings almost every day in the run-up to the expected announcement of a May 5 polling date. This morning Mr Milburn, Labour's election strategist, reminded reporters that the diaries of Woodrow Wyatt quoted Michael Howard as once saying: \"Unemployment never matters.\" A Conservative spokesman said: \"The New Deal has cost \u00a35bn so far but the government's own figures show it is a dismal failure. \"Over a million young people have left the New Deal, but only 37% manage to find a 'sustained job' - and the definition of this is only a job that lasts for more than 13 weeks. \"The majority of people on the New Deal just end up back on benefits, and those who have found jobs would have found them anyway, due to rising employment levels. \"We will replace the New Deal and give people a more flexible and effective programme called Work First, which will be run by independent contractors with a wealth of experience at getting people into sustained jobs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
