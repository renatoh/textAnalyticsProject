Would it be Hassan Nasrallah, whose campaign against Israel made him the pin-up of choice from Cairo to Marrakech? Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose defiance of UN sanctions and bellicose rhetoric is popular outside Iran? Or even Osama bin Laden, the self styled \"Sheikh\", whose hate-filled campaign of terror is seen by some as a just jihad against the hegemony of the west? But such poster-boys of hate reflect reality less accurately than they do prejudices against the Muslim community. It should go without saying that the majority of Muslims, whether they live in Karachi or Kuala Lumpur are moderates. And one of the leaders of this moderate majority is the prime minister of Malaysia, Abdullah Badawi. Precisely because he is a quiet moderate, many will have heard nothing of his leadership of the Muslim community. But by the middle of March, Badawi will have completed Malaysia's four-year stint as chairman of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN. It comprises 57 Muslim states, ranging from Saudi Arabia and Indonesia to Morocco, and describes itself as \"the collective voice of the Muslim world\". Malaysia goes to the polls on March 8 2008. The west should take a little bit more notice of this moderate Muslim leader because Badawi, as prime minister and chairman of the OIC, has been playing an important role in building bridges between the Muslim world and the west, and in trying to make real improvements to the lives of people living in Islamic countries. His contribution - like his personality - has been made in a modest, thoughtful and deliberate way, but that should not detract from the efforts he has put in. Unlike Iain Duncan Smith, he is a \"quiet man\" politician who has actually achieved something. Another stereotype that is important to break down is that the Muslim world is populated by universally oil-rich, resource-rich countries. Of the 57 countries in the OIC, some 31 are classified as among the world's least developed; the bottom five of the list are all Muslim countries. Together, the OIC accounts for 20% of the world's population but only 5% of global GDP. Badawi refuses to accept as \"inevitable\" that unemployment rates in Muslim countries are double the global average, that nearly one third of the populations are illiterate, and that women continue to face many disadvantages. Quite apart from the increasing importance of trade from and among Muslim nations as a result of globalisation, Badawi's argument has been that the cause of much of the social unrest, terrorism and extremism lies in the poverty, ignorance and squalor of much of the population of the Muslim world. Tackling these threats to peace, progress and stability have been central to Badawi's tenure at the OIC. As a result, the OIC agreed a new development agenda in December 2005 with the signing of the Makkah Declaration. The declaration focused firmly on the need for economic and social development in the Muslim world to help resolve the challenges of poverty, illiteracy and backwardness, and to promote quality of life issues, prosperity, peace and stability. The Makkah Declaration is a success for Badawi's moderate and mainstream brand of progressive Islam. That said, Badawi has not had it all his own way. Insufficient progress has been made towards achieving the declaration's objectives. Of course, there are criticisms that he should have gone further and faster on anti-corruption measures. Badawi needs to renew his push toward eliminating corruption - something that features in his election manifesto. Indeed there are ongoing concerns about corruption, in the police, for example. But compared with its neighbours, such as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, Malaysia has made progress. Addressing the annual meeting of the World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF), held in Kuala Lumpur last year, Badawi asserted that there is a need for a clear and shared commitment to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and unemployment across the Islamic world. Badawi was the driving force behind the creation of the WIEF, which brings together government, business leaders, academics and other leaders to promote greater commercial links between Muslim states and identify best practice in business development and trade. The emergence of a new economic agenda for the Muslim world rests on three pillars, according to Badawi: enhancing economic and commercial links within the Muslim world, advancing a modern progressive interpretation of Islam, and - crucially - improving cooperation between the Muslim world and the west. But Badawi has also been at pains to make the case that development of a new economic agenda also requires reform within the Muslim world and the emergence of an Islam with a progressive worldview. This is not a one-way street. There is a strong recognition that in order to gain improved cooperation with the west, there has to be an understanding in the west that Islamic countries should not be stereotyped, when some are modern, progressive and even liberal democracies. In his opening address to the WIFE, in May 2007, Badawi took a stand by saying that poor governance was still a regrettable feature of many Muslim countries. Quite bravely, he argued that tackling corruption and the abuse of civil and political liberties are central to creating a literate and informed society. \"[The] Muslim world will progress farthest when it unlocks and develops this potential, through quality education at all levels,\" he argued, stressing that this \"will never be achieved if some Muslims continue to neglect the right to education and work for women\". Badawi's vision of a progressive Islam has also been at the heart of his engagement with the west. He advocates a theory known as Islam Hadhari, or \"civilisational Islam\", which argues for a positive relationship between Islam and economic and technological development. In January, Badawi was a key participant in the Alliance of Civilisations forum, hosted by the Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, in Madrid. As Dr Farhan Ahmad Nizami, director of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, has said, Malaysia's leadership in this dialogue is crucial: This is one of the most important issues of the modern world: better understanding between the Islamic world and the west. What is needed is really the building of bridges between Muslim and western societies, bridges which are strong enough to carry the weight of differences and that can cover the divide that separates them. It is therefore important that a prosperous, self-confident nation like Malaysia is playing a pivotal role in this dialogue. It was this argument that Badawi made to the international community at Davos recently. He used the opportunity of a shared platform with Tony Blair and other leaders to make a proposal that there should be a new era of building bridges between east and west, that it was crucial to develop concrete initiatives for inter-faith cooperation, and that only with real partnership rather than rhetoric could the world hope to tackle extremist tendencies. Such leadership can be dangerous in the face of a radical Islamist minority viewpoint - of the kind espoused by Nasrallah, bin Laden and the like. The bold and imaginative approach taken by Badawi to build bridges with the west, drive a progressive Islam, and tackle corruption and poor governance in the Muslim world, has not always made him friends at home. In fact, in the election campaign he is currently fighting, the challenge comes from an alliance of opposition parties led by a conservative Islamic party committed to introducing Sharia law. Despite this, Badawi has stuck firmly and resolutely to his own vision of Malaysia as a modern, progressive Islamic country, a multiracial, multicultural and multiparty democracy that looks outwards to the rest of the world and rejects the insularity and isolationism of the extremists. It is time we in the west recognised and supported this brand of moderate leadership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
