Every day, it seems, another powerful voice joins the chorus demanding a global eco-agenda committed to zero emissions and very personal sacrifices. Now it's the turn of Timothy Garton Ash to ask readers if we're ready to \"settle for less so others can have more? Am I? Are you?\" Well, here's the good news: Yes! No fewer than seven readers tell me they've given up supermarket hummus in the last week. And not just because of the salmonella scare - permanently. And isn't each trip to the recycler's a case of someone settling for less, so others can have more? For example, Rowan just took in our home breadmaker. Just a few years ago that valuable but rarely used breadmaker would have been thrown away. Now someone else will get the chance to make delicious home-cooked bread overnight, while we manage without it. We can. Can you? So now we're on to the next elephant in the room - even if Rowan says books are way too small to be elephants (really? How about if you stack them all up? Is there a law saying elephants in rooms have to be big?). Ever since the Booker panel was announced I've been asking myself: is it ethical to read? In fact I can't believe it took me this long to see books for what they are: lumps of dead tree. When you think how many forests were wasted, and how much energy squandered in producing and distributing them around the world, how can anyone who cares about the planet buy a new book without a profound sense of guilt? Now, where you see the new Thomas Harris, I see a trail of stinking emissions. And for what? Don't get me wrong. I'm no philistine. I've always loved fiction, sharing ideas, taking a journey into a writer's imagination. But these days, unless I'm sure that writer can make some positive contribution to the planet, I just don't feel I can justify the cost of the journey. Or not unless it's offset. Once we started it was easy to chuck out Rowan's collection of Conrans and Coopers (I know), with their endorsement of long haul flights, limousines, hot tubs and luxury city breaks. In contrast most of my spy thrillers depict an impressively sustainable cold war ethic. Naturally we'll be keeping anything with a green message: Dylan Thomas, Laurie Lee, HE Bates, The Hobbit, George Monbiot. And short books, where the author demonstrates a commitment to live with less so that others can have more. But any long books from the last two decades are out. I was sorry to say goodbye to The Corrections, but not A Suitable Boy. \"How does Vikram Seth live with himself?\" Rowan said as she added all three volumes to the recycling pile. What will we read? To be honest, not much for a while, since we're both busy with our own, very different literary projects. For me it's a pamphlet - on recycled paper - challenging the government to follow Australia's example and ban flip-flops. They can. Can't we? Meanwhile Rowan's writing what promises to be the world's first piece of green chicklit, \"detailing the hilarious ups and downs in the life of young mum Savannah as she struggles to find a romantic life, and pamper herself occasionally, in a freezing cold house where her humourless eco-campaigner husband has banned hot baths!\". I haven't read it yet, but Rowan says it could teach young women a valuable lesson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
