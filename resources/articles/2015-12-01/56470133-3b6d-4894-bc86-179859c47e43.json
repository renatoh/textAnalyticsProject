The study based its recommendations on an after-action report of the unrest in Baltimore following the death of Gray, an unarmed black man, in police custody in April. It is the third such report. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake fired police commissioner Anthony Batts after the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 released the first report in July. The second study was conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum (Perf), a Washington DC-based organization. This new study, prepared by three researchers at Johns Hopkins University, deals with the city more broadly than either of the other reports, which focused exclusively on police action and preparedness. It stresses the importance of collaboration and shared responsibility between city agencies. The Hopkins study also attempts to address some questions left unanswered by the previous reports, especially the question of who made the decision to shut down public transportation at Mondawmin Mall on 27 April, a decision partially responsible for escalating the situation that day. The report says that the Baltimore police department, the Baltimore City school police and the Maryland Transit Agency police \u201cin incident command jointly decided to divert bus service around Mondawmin and secure the entrance to the Metro station at 14:54\u201d. Though this information is more specific than any previously provided, it still fails to hold any agency or individual directly responsible for actions that many in the community believe directly endangered minors by stranding them in a volatile situation where lines of police in riot gear had already formed. \u201cMost of us agree it was a very poor decision, attributed to the chaos, the students could not leave the area as they should have been able to leave,\u201d said councilman Carl Stokes, who announced his candidacy for mayor on Thursday night. \u201cThe busses and the subway should have been available and the students should have been let out in stages.\u201d When the Perf report was released last month, Rawlings-Blake said: \u201cIt\u2019s not who did what, it\u2019s not the \u2018gotcha,\u2019 it\u2019s the fact that we want to make sure through strong communication that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d The report argues that in order to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again, the city as a whole needs \u201cwritten policies and guidelines regarding mass demonstration management, which define the overall strategic approach as well as the tactical response framework\u201d. The Department of Justice is also currently involved in an investigation of the city\u2019s police force. Both Davis and Rawlings-Blake released statements claiming that they are already addressing concerns raised by the study. \u201cI am confident that we have addressed, or are in the process of addressing, many of the recommendations in the report,\u201d Rawlings-Blake said. The report coincides with defense testimony in Porter\u2019s trial this week that deals with precisely what a police officer\u2019s duty is in any given situation. Captain Justin Reynolds testified Friday that, since Porter was only an assisting officer, he was not negligent, as the prosecution has claimed, but actually went \u201cbeyond what many officers would have done\u201d. Jury deliberation is expected to begin next week. Both the mayor and the police commissioner have called for calm, regardless of the verdict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
