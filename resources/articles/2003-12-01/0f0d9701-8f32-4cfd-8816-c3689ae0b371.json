Take about a pound of butter, half a pound of sugar, a good slug of brandy and a smidgen of lemon juice. Put them in the bowl of a food processor and let the blades rip until everything is perfectly smooth. Put the blend in an old cottage cheese tub, clip on the lid, and drop the tub in the rubbish bin. No one will miss it. If brandy butter didn't exist, no one would bother to invent it. This is a purely personal view, of course, but not one unique to me. Others agree with my basic points on brandy butter, namely that (a) it tastes terrible and (b) it's strange to hurl such a calorie-dense weapon at a calorie-dense target such as Christmas pudding. And it isn't necessary. A light custard sauce (aka cr\u00e8me anglaise) goes much better with the festive black hole that is Christmas pudding. And I've learnt a lower-cal version that's better still. The knowledge comes from Sally Schneider's A New Way To Cook (Artisan, \u00a318.99), one of the three or four truly original cookbooks of the past decade, and it's a real winner. Schneider has experimented at almost unimaginable length with new ways to shave calories from old favourites without sacrificing quality. Here is her pared-down custard, more or less as she describes it. The recipe begins with arrowroot, a starch made from a plant native to the Caribbean; use cornflour instead if you need to. Measure out 225ml of whole milk. Transfer a tablespoonful to a mixing bowl, then mix a teaspoon of arrowroot into it and stir until dissolved. Pour the remaining milk into a small, heavy saucepan (and I really mean heavy, as the pan will be used for cooking the custard). Split a vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds, and put seeds and pod into the milk pan. Bring to a gentle simmer. In the meantime, whisk one egg yolk and three tablespoons of caster sugar into the arrowroot mixture. When the milk has reached its simmer, pour half of it into the bowl and whisk briskly. Add the remainder and repeat. Tip the whole lot into the saucepan and cook, with constant whisking, over the gentlest possible heat; a heat diffuser would do good service here. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it's done. Strain into a clean bowl, leave to cool, then cover and refrigerate until needed. You can make this stuff a few days in advance. You can flavour it further with spices, citrus or ginger. You can even introduce a little alcohol, if you like, such as brandy, for nostalgic appeal. But remember: the only place for brandy butter is the bin, where it can do no harm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
