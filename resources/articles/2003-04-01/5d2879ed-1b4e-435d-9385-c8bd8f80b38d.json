Stephen Glass, who scored the clincher against Burnley in the previous round, toys with the thought that he may make his last appearance for Watford in the FA Cup final if his team beat Southampton tomorrow. Once upon a time, such reflections would have meant that the midfielder was on the verge of either retirement or a move to the big time. Glass is heading towards to unemployment. He knows already that there will be no new contract on offer at Vicarage Road this summer. Energy will be devoted to fidgeting and hoping that his agent can stimulate interest from other managers. The player had seemed to have a fulfilling career guaranteed when Newcastle United bought him from Aberdeen for \u00a3650,000 in 1998. Life has not proceeded as expected, but he seems placid about the turn of events. While he might not have made the anticipated progress at St James' Park, Glass also suffers from ill fortune. The collapse of ITV Digital and Gianluca Vialli's costly, calamitous season as manager almost destroyed Watford. The wrecked plans of people like Glass are part of the collateral damage. Outside the Premiership elite, the sport is all scramble and improvisation. Despite Glass's difficulties, the upheaval can be invigorating for some individuals. Watford have patched up their squad by borrowing Michael Chopra from Newcastle, and the 19-year-old forward opened his account in senior football with four goals in the 7-4 victory over Burnley a week ago. The manager Ray Lewington must be pleased, if taken aback, to find that he now has to deliberate over his options in attack. For clubs like Watford the football environment has become unstable, throwing up problems, shocks and, just to maintain the element of surprise, a few blessings. Sheffield United, who are bound for the promotion play-offs in the First Division, are far better-placed, but at Bramall Lane too you detect the haphazard, hand-to-mouth manner in which clubs must now function. Stuart McCall, who turns 39 in the summer, finds himself being encouraged to consider signing up for another year or two. He is remarkable, still capable of snapping at opponents while also understanding far better than he ever did in his prime how best to apply his energies. The shrewdness of age is more conspicuous than the physical decline, as even Arsenal might notice in the first of tomorrow's semi-finals. McCall is in the line-up on merit, but it is a sign of these agitated times that anyone even thought of recruiting such an elderly athlete. The Premiership clubs are a privileged group by dint of having some sort of meaningful budget at their disposal. Foolish as it is to talk of Southampton buying success, Gordon Strachan is blessed that he can develop his squad with the acquisition of, say, Fabrice Fernandes, Antti Niemi and the Cup-tied David Prutton. Watford must wonder if they will ever be in that sort of position again. Twenty years ago, wealth was less concentrated and they could be a club of some standing and means. The side that lost to Everton in the 1984 FA Cup final had a young John Barnes on the wing and the emerging Maurice Johnston at centre-forward. It is hard to conceive of such players spending significant time there in the future. While talent is sporadic, First Division clubs now live on their piratical wits and develop obdurate tactics. Sheffield United have beaten Leeds United in each of the Cup competitions. The barbed remarks of their manager Neil Warnock also came close to distracting Liverpool in the Worthington Cup semi-final. Warnock relishes the idea of being a maverick. While other managers are technocrats, he is almost self-consciously populist. His superstitions are paraded. He does not, for example, go for a haircut while his side are on an unbeaten run. Whether through penury or choice, the First Division clubs have developed an off-beat air. Southampton and, particularly, Arsenal should succeed tomorrow, but along the way there may be spells when they look at maverick opponents with sheer puzzlement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
