Before Boris Johnson addressed ConHome's \"Olympotastic\" rally on Monday a warm-up video included shots of absentees Louise Mensch (activists booed) and Andrew \"Pleb\" Mitchell (laughter), whose \u00a316m grants of aid to Rwanda are now being investigated. \u2022 Interestingly, ConHome, 52% owned by tax-efficient moneybags Lord Ashcroft, launched a hard-copy magazine version this week, making its role more comparable to Tribune. Launched by Nye Bevan in 1937, Tribune has been a thorn in the Labour leadership's flesh ever since. On his own ConHome blog Ashcroft reveals that birthday boy David Cameron asked him to buy a newspaper or two (all of it, not just one copy). Logic dictates that it would have to be the Guardian because it is so influential at the lefty BBC, quips Ashcroft. Ho, ho. One retired conference security expert, now a Tory delegate (would you believe it?), fondly recalls how graceful both Margaret Thatcher and Labour's might-have-been PM, Barbara Castle, were about tiresome security checks, in contrast to Clare Short. In his new memoirs Jack Straw recalls the feminist Castle, his then-boss, sending congrats to Thatcher on becoming Tory leader in 1975. Hard to imagine unsisterly Maggie doing it for Babs. \u2022 Jeremy Hunt told yesterday's conference that his dad \"worked as a manager for the NHS\", which is a slight stretch. What he meant to say was that after leaving the Royal Navy Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt (now 81) was part-time chairman of SW Surrey district health authority, later chairman of Nuffield Hospitals. Admirable of the admiral, but not quite a harassed \"manager\". Or \"faceless bureaucrat\", as Tory conference speeches tend to call them. \u2022 Good day Former Queen lead guitarist and badger-buff Brian May has been swanning around the conference. He voted Tory until 2010 when those heartless Cameroons promised to cull badgers. \u2022 Bad day Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove had to make their big speeches in the wake of the Boris tsunami. Two-thirds of the mayor's audience melted away. Nothing personal. Emotionally drained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
