Sometimes mentally I become too sick \u2026 I have no privacy here, because there\u2019s no door in the room, so I\u2019m always worried when I want to change my clothes.\u201d Bahari has been detained since 17 October after Iranian authorities put out a red notice about her to Interpol. The notice reportedly relates to an alleged offence committed in Iran, but Bahari \u2013 who is also a model and actress \u2013 said Tehran was seeking to extradite her to punish her for her politics. A decision about Bahari\u2019s asylum application is expected on Monday. Until then she must continue to wait with airport officials, sleeping in a constantly lit room and washing in public bathrooms. \u201cAll the walls here are white, the bed is white, everything is white \u2026 there is always light here. When I check my phone I can\u2019t understand if it\u2019s 7am or 7pm. I\u2019m losing time, sometimes I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d In October it was reported that Interpol\u2019s notice about Bahari related to an alleged assault on an Iranian national in the Philippines, where she had been studying dentistry and competing in beauty contests. However she said Philippine officials told her the charge was in fact related to an unspecified crime that took place in Tehran some time since the start of 2018. Interpol has been contacted regarding the red notice. Bahari said she had not been to Iran since 2014 and that Iranian authorities had made a \u201cfake case\u201d to try to silence her for being a vocal opponent of the regime. At the 2018 Miss Intercontinental beauty contest in Manila she made headlines by waving a poster of Reza Pahlavi, the Iranian former crown prince and prominent critic of the current leadership. She has also spoken about Iranian women\u2019s rights and criticised Islamic law, on which Iran\u2019s legal system is based. \u201cWhen I got out of Iran I started to be a voice of my people, especially women,\u201d she said. \u201cI always think: \u2018How can I make my voice louder?\u2019 So I decided to participate in the beauty pageant. I thought it\u2019d be a good chance to talk about politics. \u201cThe real reason [Tehran is seeking to extradite me] is that the regime is against political activists and is anti-women. They are trying to silence me, to scare other women in Iran to become quiet. The women of Iran are tired of this regime that doesn\u2019t give basic freedom. When they come to the street sharia police stop them and bring them to the police office: \u2018Why do you wear clothes like that?\u2019 It\u2019s like we\u2019re in prison.\u201d Bahari said that seeking asylum in the Philippines, a move made in the airport when she returned to the country from Dubai, was an emergency measure to prevent her being forced onto a plane to Tehran. \u201cI don\u2019t need a government to spend money on me, I can stand on my feet. I just need a safe place to continue my life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
