Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that \u201cmajor\u201d additional sanctions were being prepared to use against Iran from Monday to block Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Washington\u2019s relations with Tehran have worsened after Trump aborted a military strike following the downing of a US spy drone last week, with the response threatening to open up another front in the geopolitical disputes holding back the world economy. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said on Sunday that a fresh round of sanctions against Iran would serve as a warning not to \u201cmistake US prudence and discretion for weakness\u201d. The tensions in the Middle East saw the price of oil rise in early trade on Monday, with a barrel of Brent crude up 0.6% to $65.58, near Friday\u2019s three-week high of $65.76. Asian share prices were subdued on Monday but the threat of sanctions rather than a full-scale military intervention by the US gave some comfort to investors. The renewed tensions come as China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and Trump prepare to meet this week in an attempt to break the deadlock in the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing. Chinese state media reported over the weekend the first official confirmation of Xi\u2019s attendance at the G20 gathering of world leaders in Osaka, Japan, where he is expected to meet with the US president. Set against a backdrop of simmering hostility over trade between the two countries, the meeting could provide a potential breakthrough in the dispute that has harmed the resilience of the global economy over the past year. Stock markets around the world have rallied in recent weeks on the back of increased optimism of a deal between Washington and Beijing, while any reversal of the progress towards a resolution could send stocks into a tailspin. Trump and Xi met at the last G20 summit in Argentina in December, reaching a breakthrough at that time before progress was reversed earlier this year. Trump raised tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3157bn) of imports from China from 10% to 25% in May while threatening to impose more on a further $325bn of Chinese goods. China has hit back with its own tariffs, albeit covering fewer imports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
