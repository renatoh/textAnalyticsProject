He writes: 'My mobility is restricted, my eyesight is impaired and I am clumsy. Five years ago, I was awarded \u00a3450,000 in medical damages. This has been held in trust by the Court Funds Office until this month when I reach 18 and it becomes my responsibility. I live a relatively normal and independent life for my age. I intend to go to university next year to study politics and something else. University will cost me more than most students because I have to use taxis and buy suitable computer equipment. When I leave home, I will have to pay for help with food, laundry, cleaning and domestic maintenance. Holidays and insurance are more expensive for me. I expect I will have a career but perhaps a part-time rather than full-time job. I should be able to live an independent life, using money from the award to cover extra costs for transport, home help and home adaptations. When I start work, it's quite likely that I will to want to buy a property. In 1999, the award was put into a high-interest savings account. In 2001, the Court Funds Office strongly advised that half be invested in shares. This was worth about \u00a3250,000 at the time but is now worth about \u00a3165,000. The rest of my money remained in the cash account and now comes to \u00a3305,000. I will need some annual income to support my education and enhance my lifestyle but the priority, while I am studying, should be to improve the capital value of my investments. That said, I need to make substantial provision for my later life as my disabilities are likely to affect me more then and may be complicated by other health problems. So a substantial portion of the award should be invested now to provide me with financial security later. My most immediate question is what to do about my current portfolio of investments. Should some or all be sold, or retained in the expectation that their performance eventually proves worthwhile? The other question is what to do with the \u00a3300,000 in cash. I think that much of this should also be invested but I do not want to repeat the mistake of three years ago. Also, as I will now become liable for tax, perhaps I should have an offshore bank account.' Michael Buy a property without delay You face critical investment decisions and, although we give some suggestions here, you must talk it through with an experienced financial adviser. First decide how much to keep in cash and how much to invest for the longer term. Anna Bowes, investments manager at Chase de Vere, calculates: 'Michael could earn \u00a318,800 a year before tax if he invested the whole \u00a3470,000 for income, with a little capital growth, at 4 per cent.' That is probably more income than you will need at university, so scale down the proportion providing income and invest the rest entirely for capital growth. Michael Brill, a director at Baronworth, suggests you save \u00a320,000 in an ING Direct deposit account at 5 per cent with instant access. He then recommends putting \u00a350,000 into a Nationwide offshore account: 'The interest is taxable but compounds gross.' Other advisers are less keen on going offshore. Matt Pitcher of Towry Law and Bowes reckons an offshore bank account might be too complicated, because you would have to submit a tax return. With your equity investments, Brill believes: 'It's not a bad idea to cut his losses on the existing investments and go into something safer.' He suggests putting \u00a3200,000 into a guaranteed growth bond or guaranteed income bond paying 4.7 per cent net, worth 5.88 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer, for three years with no risk. Or a distribution bond such as Axa Sun Life or Legal and General's where half is invested in gilts, fixed interest and cash and you can take 5 per cent income a year without tax: 'He could cash it in if he buys a property in five or six years' time.' Pitcher recommends keeping the existing investments in the hope that they recover: 'The investments made in 2001 seem to consist of investment trusts and unit trusts almost exclusively investing in the stock market, with little exposure to other assets such as fixed-interest securities and property.' Bowes comments: 'It's understandable to feel nervous about investing in anything other than cash after his experience, but three years really is a short investment timescale. I suggest spreading the money 50 per cent in shares, 25 per cent in fixed interest and 25 per cent in property. The shares should be mainly UK-based, in equity income funds, but some global exposure is important. Fixed interest will provide the bulk of the income and will also diversify the risk.' Pitcher suggests a fund supermarket such as Co-funds to consolidate your unit trust portfolio in one place: 'Many of his existing unit trusts can be transferred at no cost. I suggest Michael uses Cofunds to maximise his Isa allowance of \u00a37,000 a year as well. He should then look for a balanced portfolio that includes gilts, corporate bonds and commercial property as well as shares for his new investments.' Mark Quilter is a divisional director at Gerrard and for the last 16 years has invested money for people under the Mental Health Act and who are recipients of personal injury and damages awards: 'I suggest Michael uses at least half the large cash balance to buy a property as he will definitely need a property to live in. With the likelihood of property prices continuing to rise over the longer term, any delay could prove to be a mistake. Holding a property will also diversify Michael's portfolio.' Bowes points out that working part-time could result in a smaller pension so suggests starting a stakeholder pension now: '... although this is not such a good idea if his life expectancy is shorter than normal as it will tie up money that he may never benefit from.' You could take money from your deposit account to pay premiums of \u00a32,808 a year which the Inland Revenue tops up to \u00a33,600. Finally Bowes advises: 'Michael should put the bulk of the money into a trust immediately and arrange for a power of attorney in case, later on, he suffers mental incapacity. With the settlement, he would lose any means-tested state benefits he might receive but settling the money into trust shelters it from means-testing.' Michael's to-do list 1.
