Nothing remarkable there \u2013 he is, despite Ronald Koeman\u2019s best efforts, still an Everton player after all \u2013 although the striker\u2019s attire underlined the speed of his transformation from outcast to saviour. Unlike his team-mates, Niasse does not have a club suit to wear. The Senegal international was not part of Koeman\u2019s squad when they were fitted for suits in the summer but Everton have ordered one for their \u00a313.5m signing in time for Burnley\u2019s visit on Sunday. It is the least they can do. The manager should ensure it is tailored to perfection, and leave a thank you note in the pocket. Goodison was an uncomfortable place for Koeman until around 4.30pm on Saturday, its anger rising over another disjointed team selection and another laboured performance that sailed close to a damaging defeat by Bournemouth. Jordan Pickford\u2019s save from Jermain Defoe, minutes after Josh King had driven the visitors ahead, proved a pivotal moment. To the manager\u2019s credit he took decisive action and introduced Niasse, Tom Davies and Jonjoe Kenny. All three contributed more than the players they replaced and Everton were repaid with a first win in five Premier League games. Niasse was rewarded for his attitude and application in the face of the manager\u2019s cold shoulder with two invaluable goals and a hero\u2019s ovation. He also had an open goal to respond to Koeman\u2019s treatment of him last season. He chose to miss. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t want to go over the past with him,\u201d the 27-year-old said. \u201cThere is nothing to say about that. He just said this was a new opportunity for me and he wanted to look at me again. \u201cLast year he said I wasn\u2019t ready and maybe I wasn\u2019t ready. I went to the under-23s and learned more and learned I have to work hard. Maybe that has helped me get to this position now because football is hard, it is very difficult. I went away, I learned and I have come back stronger. I tried just to keep my head on me, to not lose it, and the best way to do that is to just keep working hard. Even if I wasn\u2019t on the pitch for every game or was with the under-23s, I was running on the pitch like a dog.\u201d The Everton striker was told to leave the club after a 45\u2011minute appearance in Koeman\u2019s first pre\u2011season friendly in the summer of 2016 and ostracised to the under-23s when he did not, before a successful loan spell at Hull City. \u201cIt is not only football \u2013 life is like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a strong mind and a strong mentality. I know where I am from and where I want to go. It is not a case of something bad happening and so I give up. I kept saying to myself: \u2018Anything can happen.\u2019 It was a hard time with the under-23s and seeing my team-mates enjoying the games here without me. I was with the under-23s instead, travelling and playing at empty stadiums, but that\u2019s life. \u201cYou have to keep working hard and keep in your mind that anything can happen. That\u2019s what I did. Today is good but you don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow. I just have to stay strong and get stronger.\u201d Koeman may have been indebted to Niasse\u2019s contribution against Bournemouth \u2013 one that left Eddie Howe visibly devastated as the chairman, Jeff Mostyn, tried to console him afterwards \u2013 but he refused to accept he may have erred in his treatment of the forward last season. \u201cHe did have a locker,\u201d the Everton manager claimed. \u201cThere are a lot of stories. \u201cAt that time I preferred to play with other strikers and we had other players in that position. The situation for him was really difficult. That is the past now. I try to be honest and try to be straight and if someone deserves the opportunity he will get it. That is not just for Oumar but all the players. I don\u2019t have any problem with Oumar because I spoke with him before the transfer window ended and said: \u2018OK, you will get your chance with the first team. Work hard and get your chance.\u2019 That is what he did, his attitude was perfect.\u201d Niasse, however, will not get the opportunity to score in a third consecutive game for Everton when Apollon Limassol arrive in the Europa League on Thursday. He was not included in Koeman\u2019s squad list when it was submitted to Uefa on 5 September. Like the suit, Niasse must wait for that one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
