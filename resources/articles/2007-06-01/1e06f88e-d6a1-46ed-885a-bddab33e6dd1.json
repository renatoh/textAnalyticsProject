The former West Ham United goalkeeper Shaka Hislop is leading the Soca Warriors in legal action against the T&amp;T Football Federation, for which Warner is a special adviser, alleging that promised bonuses were not paid. Warner has effectively blacklisted 16 players, including Hislop, Stern John and Chris Birchall, and accused them of being \"consumed by greed\" after they demanded that a pre-tournament contract to share 50% of World Cup commercial revenues should be honoured. The federation did deals with Adidas, Ebay, British Gas and KFC before the tournament, with some estimates putting the total value at more than $11.5m (\u00a35.8m). The players claim they have been offered only \u00a3400 each, with items including travelling expenses and hotel fees, all of which were covered by Fifa, deducted. In a letter to Warner, Hislop accuses him of a \"slanderous attack\" and makes it clear that he will be called to give evidence when proceedings begin in the next week. Last year Fifa's ethics commission ruled that Warner had abused his position by making a \u00a3500,000 profit on marked-up World Cup tickets sold through his family travel company, but he hung on to his influential Fifa post. Science of compliance The FA is to bolster the intelligence-gathering arm of its compliance unit as it prepares to enforce the regulations on agents it will introduce in September. The FA board approved a boost to the compliance department's funding before Lord Stevens completed his inquiry, and some of the new money will be spent on ensuring the organisation has better information to lead it to regulation breaches. The department's computer systems are also being overhauled, a process that will allow investigators to use a database of players and agents more effectively. The FA will push ahead with publishing a final version of the new regulations at the end of next week despite objections from agents, who are keen to water down restrictions on dual representation. Making over racing British horseracing's new regime used the start of Ascot's Royal meeting to convene a meeting of executives from leading racing countries to examine ways of better promoting the sport. The new British Horseracing Authority, led by its chairman, Paul Roy, and chief executive, Nic Coward, is intent on transforming the marketing of racing and is looking outside the often parochial confines of the sport for advice. Executives from the Australian, US, Hong Kong, Japanese and French racing governing bodies heard presentations from speakers including George O'Grady, chief executive of golf's European Tour, Etienne de Villiers, the president of the ATP Tour, and the advertising guru Robin Wight, chairman of the Engine group. Wight's presentation was entitled \"How to change people's minds about racing\", an indication of the challenge the BHA is set to lay down to the sport. 2008 TV split The BBC and ITV have agreed a \u00a355m joint deal to broadcast football's European Championship next summer, close to 25% up on the fee paid for Euro 2004 despite attempts by both broadcasters to hold out for a cut-price deal in light of England's troubled qualifying campaign. The deal, brokered by the Sport Five agency, will please Uefa, which heeded advice to deal with each territory individually rather than accept an offer from the European Broadcasting Union, which won the 2004 rights. This may be the last deal in which ITV and BBC enjoy the protection afforded by the listing system that ensures the Euros can appear only on terrestrial TV. Royal approval London's Olympic logo got a royal seal of approval yesterday when Princess Anne wore the new badge at the British Olympic Association's AGM. Tellingly she was the only member of the hierarchy sporting the badge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
