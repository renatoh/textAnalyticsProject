The Muslim holy month of Ramadan starts at sunset this evening. 2. The Islamic calendar is lunar, so the start of Ramadan is determined by scholarly observation of the heavens. 3. For the devout, sunset doesn't mean when the streetlights come on. It is timed to the very minute on each day of Ramadan, with regional variations. 4. Even more detailed information on the timing of the lunar cycle can be found on the Greenwhich Royal Observatory website, or from the excellent US Naval Observatory site. 5. For observant Muslims, Ramadan is a very special time. The main feature is a total fast during daylight hours - though there are several exempt categories. In addition, there are Ramadan rules covering more or less all aspects of life. 6. Non-Muslims have a great many misconceptions of Islamic traditions. 7. There will be Ramadan broadcasts by Britain's burgeoning Muslim radio community. There is even a Radio Ramadan, broadcasting in five cities. 8. The essentials of Ramadan can be explored in great detail on the internet. 9. Islamic scholars believe that the first revelation of the Quran, the holy book of Islam, was made to the prophet Mohammad on the night of the 27th day of Ramadan. This night is called the Laylat-al-Qadr (Night of Power). And according to the Quran, this is when God determines the course of the world for the following year. 10. The end of Ramadan (on December 16 in Britain) will be marked by Muslims all round the world with a great feast and holiday, Eid ul-Fitr."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
