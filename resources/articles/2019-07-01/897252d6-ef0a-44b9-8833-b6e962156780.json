Nearly eight million people watched the team\u2019s quarter-final victory against Norway but Neville, the England manager, expects 10 to 12 million to watch the biggest game in the history of England women\u2019s football. That would exceed the season finale of the police corruption drama Line of Duty, which had 9.6 million viewers in June \u2013 the biggest overnight TV rating of the year so far. \u201cIt\u2019s our biggest strength as a nation that we come together as a country in these moments,\u201d said Neville. \u201cI heard 7.9 million saw the Norway game but we\u2019ll have 10 to 12 million watching against the US. We have gathered momentum on and off the pitch and now the players have got to deliver. England\u2019s women have never reached a final of a major world competition before and they will be underdogs against the US, who are the reigning World Cup holders and ranked No 1 in the world. However Neville believes that his team, which reached the semi-finals of this competition four years ago as well as the last four of the European championships in 2017, have the ability and mentality to step up. \u201cI want my players to realise that we are so close and we have to deliver,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no upside to defeat. Losing in a semi-final would mean nothing to me. Every single meeting, every single training session, every five-a-side we\u2019ve had we\u2019ve spoken about winning. Winning is the most important thing. It\u2019s about winning, that\u2019s the mentality we\u2019ve brought in. My players now have to become serial winners. We\u2019ve done semi-finals \u2013 we have to make the next step.\u201d One of the key battles is likely to be between England\u2019s best player Lucy Bronze and the American idol Megan Rapinoe, who has made headlines on the pitch by scoring five goals and off it with her criticisms of President Trump. Bronze, though, insists she is relishing the prospect. \u201cI love a challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cMegan is up there as one of the best, so to go toe-to-toe will be great. And while I think USA are a great team others have started knocking on the door, and getting close, so I believe they are beatable.\u201d Bronze admitted she also admired the US team for their social activism, which has included launching a lawsuit for equal pay against its own federation on international women\u2019s day and speaking out for gay rights, but said the England players were mainly focused on growing the women\u2019s game. \u201cWe influence where we can \u2013 and at the moment that is driving women\u2019s sport and equal opportunities for women\u2019s sport in our country,\u201d she added. \u201cIt sounds quite fairytale-like but we want to inspire the nation \u2013 little boys as well as little girls \u2013 and we want the whole country to get behind us.\u201d Meanwhile the US will be going for a record 11th World Cup victory in a row when they play England and are also breaking records off the pitch as well, with Nike announcing that the team\u2019s shirt is the biggest selling soccer jersey in the company\u2019s history. \u201cThe USA women\u2019s home jersey is now the No 1 soccer jersey, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, ever sold on Nike.com in one season,\u201d said Nike\u2019s CEO Mark Parker. \u201cThe exposure [of the Women\u2019s World Cup] is driving outstanding sell-through in kits, high-performance bras and lifestyle extensions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
