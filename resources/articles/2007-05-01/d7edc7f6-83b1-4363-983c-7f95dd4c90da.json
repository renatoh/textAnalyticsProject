Tom Varndell may have scored loads of tries for them this season, including two in the EDF Energy Cup final against the Ospreys, but for this game the Tigers have gone for two big men - Seru Rabeni and Alesana Tuilagi - out wide. Their aim will be to use Rabeni and Tuilagi off first phase, ideally sending them down the diminutive fly-half Ryan Lamb's channel. From an attacking lineout, for example, Frank Murphy will find his fly-half, Andy Goode, who will look to give an inside pass to Tuilagi, already thundering towards the gain line. Even if Gloucester bring him down, the odds are that Leicester will establish some momentum and put pressure on the opposition defence. Lamb is a fine player, a potential match-winner, so anything that dents his confidence is good news for Leicester. The two massive wings are a huge part of their offensive strategy and I'd expect them to see plenty of the ball. If they do, keep an eye out for the full-back, Geordan Murphy, who is brilliant at ghosting into dangerous positions to profit from the uncertainty created by the bigger men around him. The loss of the scrum-half Harry Ellis will be a handicap but Leicester are not just a team who seek to attack through the forwards or around the fringes. In response, Gloucester will try to put physical pressure on Ellis's replacement, Frank Murphy, and, assuming they can match the Leicester back row at the breakdown, look to Lamb to create something special, preferably early on. Playing catch-up against Leicester is not advisable. The Tigers defence is well-organised but I've seen a few games, particularly at home, when Gloucester have done well against them. They have the attacking threats out wide to trouble anybody but first they need Lamb to create a hole or two. If Gloucester can win good, quick ruck ball, Lamb will look to fool the defence with an old-fashioned dummy and create precious space for himself and the likes of James Simpson-Daniel outside. Gloucester are definitely the underdogs but they have scored 20 tries from their own half in the Premiership this season, more than any other side. It should be an intriguing contest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
