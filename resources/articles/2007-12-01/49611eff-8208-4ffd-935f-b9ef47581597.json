I thought the concert was the best I had ever seen, and while it still holds that distinction, it does so by only the narrowest of margins; for as unlikely as it seemed, the lads came stunningly close to matching their former imperious best last Monday. Certainly, for blokes who could be collecting their bus passes, Led Zeppelin produced a storming performance that also had real artistic edge. We remember those blistering riffs but sometimes forget the breadth of the musicianship of Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones - not to mention Jason Bonham - as well as their willingness to experiment. Admittedly, the slightly slower, more bluesy numbers worked best (for me at least) but then songs like 'Since I've Been Loving You' and 'Dazed and Confused' have always been Zeppelin show-stoppers. And as he did back in Glasgow, Jimmy played his guitar on 'Dazed' with a violin bow, belting out massive chords that echoed round the O2 arena. This time he performed inside a cage of green laser lines - but then Jimmy was always the showman. Best of all, however, was an almost perfect rendition of 'Kashmir', with its crashing chords and wailing vocals. It was a real bonus: my favourite Zeppelin track - recorded long after they came to Glasgow - being played as the final number of an unforgettable evening. Now I can die easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
