The flying grey loves a bit of cut and good to soft or wetter going would make her very hard to beat in the Temple Stakes. This is her first outing for nine months, so her fitness must be taken on trust, but she has managed to score on her return to action for the past two years, including at Longchamp last May. She is said to have strengthened up over the winter, which will make her a formidable proposition indeed, since she was last seen giving lumps of weight and a beating to Acapulco in the Nunthorpe. In-form types such as Waady and Profitable will make this a tough contest. Muthmir would probably not want the going to deteriorate very much and comes from the William Haggas yard that has not yet hit peak form. 2.15 Goodwood: The step up to 10 furlongs may help Decorated Knight, who will be sharper and, it must be hoped, less gassy than for his reappearance at Ascot last month. 2.30 Haydock: Returning to Flat racing from hurdling on what seems an attractive mark, Matorico looked unlucky in running at York last time. 2.40 York: Hamelin is a potential improver but Moonrise Landing is probably the one to stick with, seeking her fifth win in a row. 2.50 Goodwood: Mount Logan looked progressive for Luca Cumani last year and should continue that upward curve for Roger Varian here. Bateel was given a lot to do when second to a stablemate here last month and can perhaps put up a better effort but this looks a tougher race. 3.05 Haydock: On the basis that the ground may go against Chief Whip, Wild Hacked is tempting, having got a very fair mark for his Windsor maiden success, when he appeared to be learning rapidly on the job. 3.25 Goodwood: From a handy inside draw Ian Fleming can continue his excellent season. A turning track is thought to suit, otherwise he would be going straight to Ascot\u2019s Britannia Stakes. The very promising Oh This Is Us is drawn alongside him but is more of a hold-up type and those tactics do not always work well in big fields here, especially for a fairly inexperienced rider. 3.40 Haydock: Interception is another whose chance may be affected by the rain. The preference is for Ridge Ranger, who could follow up her Listed success from last time. 3.50 York: After a fine return to action against race-fit rivals at the Dante meeting, Doctor Sardonicus can continue last year\u2019s improvement. Judging by his career-best success at Chelmsford in September, the step down to the minimum trip has really helped David Simcock\u2019s gelding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
