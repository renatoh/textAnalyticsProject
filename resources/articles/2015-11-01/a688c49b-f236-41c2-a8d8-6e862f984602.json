So you\u2019re out in New York City for the Cricket All-Stars tour to promote the game in the US. Is it nice to be able to walk down the street without getting mobbed? I do get mobbed! We just walked out of a building and there were about 10 people that wanted selfies. Without trying to pump myself and Sachin [Tendulkar] up, I think we\u2019ve given a good account of ourselves as ambassadors for the sport. People have realised that and said, \u201chang on, these guys actually are a bit of a big deal and people do like them\u201d. There\u2019s so much awareness here: we\u2019re on the front of the New York Times! And now you\u2019re chatting to Small Talk! Yep. How exciting. Do you think of yourself as the David Beckham of cricket? I don\u2019t see myself as David Beckham. But we\u2019ve got Murali, [Mahela] Jayawardene, [Kumar] Sangakkara, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Brian Lara, [VVS] Laxman, [Sourav] Ganguly, [Rahul] Dravid, [Virender] Sehwag, Tendulkar, [Ricky] Ponting, [Glenn] McGrath, [Matthew] Hayden, [Andrew] Symonds, myself, Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar all out here, so we\u2019re trying to have a similar impact on cricket as David had on soccer in the US. Graeme Swann is out with you as well, but where are the rest of the English boys? They\u2019re all doing the punditry thing right now aren\u2019t they. Who has got the weakest banter at Sky? Nasser [Hussain]. I can wind him up very easily, on the pitch or in the commentary box. I remember when he was captain of England and I was captain of Australia at an ODI in Sydney. England only needed 20 or 30 with seven wickets in hand and they were cruising. I started sledging Nasser from cover and he got hooked, it was like Jaws grabbing on the end of a line. I brought myself on the next over and he ran down the wicket trying to hit me for six and got out stumped. McGrath and I cleaned up the rest and we won from nowhere. I like to remind him of that \u2013 in a rain delay I\u2019ll try and get the producer to put that game on. Who is your best pal in the All-Stars? Obviously I\u2019m pretty close with all the Australian guys. I\u2019ve probably spent a lot of time with Sachin and Brian Lara. I talk about the game with Sachin and the matches we\u2019ve played in the past and Brian is good fun to have a beer with and a bit of a laugh afterwards. More of a buddy to sit in a nice cool bar with. You\u2019re a single man, do you get chatted up in the NYC bars? I\u2019m just a guy going to a bar trying to unwind. You revealed earlier this year that you\u2019re on Tinder. Have you been using that in the US? I used it when I landed at the airport, but the Wi-Fi wasn\u2019t working properly. I haven\u2019t had a chance to do anything or check it out, but I\u2019ll see how the time goes. Small Talk isn\u2019t very good at dating. Not enough chit-chat apparently. Any tips? I don\u2019t live on it, it\u2019s just a bit of fun. You coached and gave a few pointers to [England spin bowler] Adil Rashid recently. How did that go? He\u2019s a work in progress. He\u2019s going to get better with time, but still a very good bowler right now. He\u2019s not quite at the level of Yasir Shah though \u2013 out of all the people that I\u2019ve ever coached or had a session with, he\u2019s got the best leg break I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s messaging me every day asking \u2018what else can you teach me?\u2019 I was his hero, he had posters of me on his wall, so it\u2019s nice to work with Yasir. But I hope that the tips I\u2019ve given to Rashid will help him too. If I can help both of them, I\u2019m more than happy. The Guardian did a recent poll asking readers if you were the most famous Australian alive. Many said yes. Who is your favourite Aussie? I feel very flattered to be considered that famous! Kylie Minogue or Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage, are my favourites. Barry\u2019s Sir Les Patterson is amazing, and Kylie \u2026 well she\u2019s just Kylie. This year you unveiled a mural in your home with a few of your favourite celebrities and friends painted on it. Oh yeah, The Ultimate Party it\u2019s called. Anthony Hopkins is cooking up some brains on the barbecue, Frank Sinatra is entertaining the whole crowd, Elvis is looking cool. I\u2019m just chilling in the corner with Bruce Springsteen. The Boss! Mr USA! Get him down to Cricket All-Stars, he could bowl the first ball! Well, we\u2019ve got a few surprises up our sleeves over who is going to be tossing the coin. All I\u2019ll say is that we\u2019re big fans of John McEnroe. You big tease. Of the people still alive, do you know everybody in the painting? I\u2019ve met a few of those guys, Chris Martin from Coldplay is one of my closest friends. There\u2019s a few others that aren\u2019t on there as well: Ed Sheeran has become a good mate of mine, and I\u2019m very lucky to have known Elton John for over 20 years. What is your karaoke song? It\u2019s a really bad one and I only sing it when I\u2019m particularly drunk: Paradise by the Dashboard Light by Meat Loaf. I know every little bit of it, too. Can you sing it to Small Talk now? No. Small Talk hopes there\u2019s some footage [Small Talk furiously Googles but can only find this tweet] out there somewhere. Nobody will ever see the footage. Last year, you said you were writing a song? What became of that? It\u2019s still a work in progress. I\u2019ve been so busy that I haven\u2019t had a chance to finish it off. I always carry a notepad and pen around with me and anytime I come up with a line or hear something, I write it down. What genre of music are we talking? It\u2019s a mixture of Time After Time, The Scientist, and Midnight in Chelsea. It\u2019s not really a pop song, but not really a ballad either. It\u2019s kind of in between. It\u2019s not a [Warne starts beatboxing a heavy dance beat] song. It\u2019s meant to be an emotional song. Will you perform it? Ha! No! I\u2019m writing it for some of my friends, see what they think of it and then if anyone wants to use it they can. Otherwise, it\u2019s just my own fun exercise to say I wrote a song. What did you make of Shane Warne: The Musical? It was quite interesting to see your life flash before your eyes. But I don\u2019t think anyone should have the right to do something on your life without your permission. I did go up on the stage and say well done, because it was interesting. But it didn\u2019t have my endorsement. What is the single biggest amount of money you\u2019ve lost in a hand of poker? Too much. Too much to say? [Stubbornly this time] Too much. OK then! Can you tell Small Talk a joke? No, but I can give you a tip: never eat yellow snow. Thanks Shane. Bye! Bye Small Talk!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
