It's obviously a ragbag of applications, but some of them are out of date, and it doesn't deliver the claimed convenience. He says: though Google goes to great pains to tout how each application in Google Pack is free, it's worth noting that many of these applications feature annoying upgrade advertisements aimed at getting you to purchase the full versions. They're limited in other ways too, as I'll describe below. But most problematic, many of these applications aren't even up-to-date. For example, the free version of Norton Antivirus includes virus definitions that are, as of this writing, an astonishing four months out of date. And the spyware definitions in Ad-Aware SE were over 120 days out of date when I installed that application. That's simply irresponsible. The sheer amount of work that a user needs to perform in order to make sure that each application Google provides is updated completely contradicts the benefits of having an integrated installer with \"only one license agreement \u2013 and no wizards.\" That's only true until you actually try to use any of these applications. You will also notice, he writes, that \"your desktop, Quick Launch toolbar, and system tray begin filling up with an unwelcome number of icons. By the time this thing is done, your PC will look like the victim of a nasty spyware attack.\" After reviewing the various apps, Thurrott concludes: Google Pack is still in beta, so the more glaring issues can be fixed by a final release, if there is one. But this initial version of Google Pack is an embarrassment to the company. It's just a mess."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
