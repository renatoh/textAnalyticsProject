There is a weekly Intercape Mainliner coach service which runs via the Caprivi Strip in northern Namibia - a 40km-wide corridor sandwiched between Botswana and Angola. I knew that armed bandits had caused trouble in this area in the past - some French tourists were killed here two years ago - but I didn't know what the current situation was. For the latest update, I checked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (a very useful site - and I'm not just saying that because I used to be a civil servant). There was a warning against travelling through Caprivi due to continuing military action along the Angolan border. However, I had met other people who had done the trip and I couldn't believe a major company like Intercape would run a service if it wasn't safe. Plus, the alternative route through central Botswana would take ages. So I crossed my fingers and caught the bus. The modern coach was air-conditioned with comfortable seats, and I settled down for the 19-hour journey. We passed quickly through Botswana before crossing the border into Namibia at Kasane. Soon we reached a police roadblock at the entrance to the Caprivi Strip and pulled over to the side of the road. The driver said we needed to wait for the convoy to take us through the area. We spent an hour standing on this barren road while a queue of cars built up behind us. At 3pm about 10 big lorries thundered past - these were obviously the meat of the convoy - and everyone got back into their vehicles. Engines started up all along the line. I was just wondering if someone would shout \"Wagons roll!\" when our escorts arrived - two armed pick-up trucks with forward-mounted machine guns and balaclava-wearing soldiers in the back. Things were definitely getting more interesting. As we set off, I peered into the bush alongside the road trying to spot bandits, but all was quiet. A couple of uneventful hours later we were through, and the escort waved goodbye. I later heard that there hasn't been any real trouble for a while and the travel warning may be lifted soon. The bus arrived in Windhoek at three in the morning. Even in the dark I could tell it wasn't like other African cities. Namibia has a relatively healthy economy built around diamond mining, and this prosperity was clearly evident in this modern city. In the colonial scramble for Africa at the end of the 19th century, Germany annexed Namibia, and there was definitely a German feel to the capital. I spent the day wandering the streets and sampling Black Forest gateau. Many of Namibia's highlights are off the beaten track and the vast distances involved make them difficult to reach on your own. Therefore I had booked myself on a tour with a recommended company, Wild Dog Safaris. They offer a range of trips and I had opted for a two-week camping tour. The first week was a swing around the north. There were six of us on the trip (the usual assortment of ages and nationalities) plus our guide, Chris. Day one was a relatively easy drive up to the Waterberg Plateau. This is a 50km-long sandstone plateau rising 150m above the surrounding plains. We climbed up the steep escarpment for a wonderful view over the bush. Chris was a member of the Herero tribe, one of the eleven major tribal groups that make up Namibia's population, and Waterberg was an important place to him. It was on these plains in 1904 that the Herero and Nama tribes rebelled against the German occupiers. The indigenous people didn't stand a chance against the superior weapons of the colonists, and over 80,000 were killed. Namibian campsites are amazingly well-equipped and comfortable. Each site has its own braai (barbeque), and that night Chris showed off his culinary skills with a tasty meal of boerewors (sausage) and lamb chops (meat is very popular here). The next day we moved on to Etosha National Park - the best wildlife park in Namibia. Etosha means 'great white place of dry water', and the park surrounds a huge saltpan, but as we travelled east to west there was a surprising variety of landscape, from bush to woodlands to savannah. We spent two days taking wonderful game drives, using the excellent campsites and listening to the lions' coughing roars late at night. Leaving Etosha we drove into Damaraland. We passed families riding in donkey-carts and extravagantly dressed Herero women selling curios by the side of the road. Chris told us that the Victorian-style outfits originate from the German missionaries who forced them upon the more scantily clad natives in the 19th century. At Twylfontein we stopped to see the famous ancient rock engravings. Under a searing sun we climbed up amongst the red boulders to the 6000 year old artwork. Even after all this time the dark shapes of rhinos, elephants and giraffe running across the rocks were clearly evident. That night we camped out in the bush at the foot of the Brandberg Mountain. Sitting round the flickering light of the fire, Chris cooked us a traditional Herero meal of mielie pap (a sort of cornflour porridge) and boiled goat, which tasted a lot better than it sounds. After seeing more ancient rock art we drove away from the mountains and grassland into the desert and another world. For miles there were nothing but flat gravel plains and a few low bushes. Then, as we neared the coast, a huge cloudbank rose up where the warm desert air met the cold air over the sea. The sun was blocked out and the temperature plummeted. This was the southern end of the inhospitable and treacherous Skeleton Coast. It was the first time I had seen the Atlantic in six months and it looked just as cold and grey as when I left it in New York last December. We spent the final night of the trip in the Swakopmund (a strange combination of Africa, Germany and English seaside resort) and had a farewell meal of fresh seafood in a restaurant built in a beached trawler. On our last morning I decided to try my hand at sandboarding. We were taken up into the huge dunes to the south of Swakopmund and kitted out with a board, helmet, gloves and elbow pads. I had opted for lying down as if I was on a sledge rather than standing up which looked far too difficult to master in just two hours. The basic technique was to lie down on your belly, lift the front of the board up out of the sand and then slide down the dune at speeds of up to 80kmph. It was excellent fun, if hard work climbing back up the steep dunes. I spent most of the four-hour journey back to Windhoek trying to get all the sand out of my ears. Next week we swing south. PS. You remember my friends, Roy and Sallie who I spent Christmas with in San Francisco? Well they got married last weekend. Sorry I couldn't be there guys - but many, many congratulations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
