The show, which opens on Monday, is open to the public and features air displays, simulators and drones. But it is also a showcase for some of the world\u2019s largest weapons manufacturers, and campaigners against the arms trade have urged the British astronaut to rethink his association. Peake is attending the event\u2019s Futures Day \u2013 a chance for young people to learn about job opportunities in the defence and aerospace sector. Several members of the government, including David Cameron, are also expected to attend along with 81 military delegations from 50 countries. Companies present will include BAE Systems, which makes Eurofighter jets; Raytheon, the company behind the Paveway IV bomb, which has been used in Yemen; and MBDA, Europe\u2019s largest missile producer. Its sales to Saudi Arabia include about 450 Storm Shadow cruise missiles, 1,000 Brimstone air-to-surface missiles, 2,000 Mistral portable surface-to-air missiles and 100 Milan anti-tank missiles. \u201cTim Peake is an icon to lots of people, and should not allow himself to be used as a promotional tool for those that profit from war and conflict,\u201d said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT). \u201cThe event is sponsored by some of the biggest arms companies in the world, and is a chance for them to draw in young people by whitewashing and sanitising the human cost of what they do. Peake should not lend them his endorsement, or the legitimacy and credibility that goes with it.\u201d UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia are the subject of a legal action by CAAT amid concerns that UK-manufactured weapons may have been used against international humanitarian law. \u201cAt a time when UK arms sales are subject to a high court review, we are seeing UK ministers and civil servants pulling out all stops to promote even more exports,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEvents like Farnborough exist to sell as many weapons as possible, but they couldn\u2019t happen without government support.\u201d The Science Museum, which is due to hold an event promoting the fair, will also be the subject of a protest from campaigners. A spokeswoman for the airshow declined to comment. Peake was unavailable for comment but his involvement with the fair is not focused on defence. He has used his Facebook page to promote the airshow as a way of reaching young fans who are keen to learn more about space."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
