Atlanta is also the home of the civil rights era activist and Democratic congressman John Lewis, whom Trump once dismissed as \u201call talk\u201d. \u201cThe Republican party was the original home for African Americans,\u201d Trump told the small gathering. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re returning.\u201d Donning \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d shirts, some wearing giant red Make America Great Again hats, and holding signs telling people to text \u201cWoke\u201d to a certain number to get more information about the campaign, the crowd booed when the president referred to the Democratic party. However, black voters, who overwhelmingly support Democrats, are an elusive demographic for the 45th US president. \ufeffTrump received only 8% of the black vote in 2016. According to a recent Gallup poll, his approval among black voters remains below 10%. To those gathered at Friday\u2019s event \u2013 a number of whom were white \u2013 he said he would campaign for every last African American vote in 2020, even though he has spent much of his three years in office antagonizing black politicians. He has called Baltimore, a predominantly black city and home of the late, prominent congressman Elijah Cummings, a\u201cdisgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess\u201d and has called Chicago an \u201cembarrassment to the nation\u201d based on gun violence, often related to poverty, in majority black neighborhoods. And after white nationalists targeted Charlottesville, Virginia, in violent clashes in 2017, and later killed a counter-protester, Trump said there had been good people \u201con both sides\u201d. He was endorsed by a Ku Klux Klan leader in 2016 and failed to vigorously denounce such support. Trump has also targeted the congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born US citizen, beaming as crowds at one of his recent rallies chanted: \u201cSend her back!\u201d On Friday, he referenced his words at an August 2016 rally in Michigan, asking the crowd \u2013 a mix of attendees from a handful of southern states \u2013 at the Georgia World Congress Center: \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Trump spent much of his 2016 campaign denigrating the country\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama. He had long promoted the lie that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. Echoing remarks from 2016, on Friday he said: \u201cYou have the worst schools of anybody in the country by far; it\u2019s not even close.\u201d And he warned: \u201cDemocrats want to invest in green global projects, I want to invest in the black American community.\u201d Trump did not expand on how that would happen, pivoting instead to complaining about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and the current impeachment inquiry. He and the vice-president, Mike Pence, cited the administration\u2019s record on creation of economic \u201copportunity zones\u201d, the low black unemployment rate nationally and the administration\u2019s anti-abortion stance, to loud cheers. Jamaal Reynolds, 26, had driven from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to see Trump in person for a third time. He was quick to denounce those who called the president racist, but said his friends and family, who are mostly Democrats, call him crazy. He explained: \u201cI was born and raised in the \u2019hood, in the projects [public housing]. The area was run by Democrats and they forgot about it all the time.\u201d The Georgia state representative Alveda King, the niece of Martin Luther King, attended the rally, as did the local politician Katrin Pierson. The Kentucky attorney general-elect, Daniel Cameron, the state\u2019s first African American elected to that position, gave a short speech. Trump has also made recent overtures to black voters with a visit to a historically black college in South Carolina and a summit for young black conservatives at the White House. As he was wrapping up in Atlanta, he joked to the crowd \u201cSixteen more years!\u201d to a smattering of laughter. Next time, he said to the crowd, they would get a bigger room to accommodate people who were waiting outside, making a favorite reference to crowd sizes despite it being clear that there was sufficient space for anyone who would have wanted access to the venue. After an hour\u2019s speech, rambling at times, he shook dozens of hands as he departed. \u201cHe signed my hat!\u201d a woman squealed to her friend, tipping her Maga hat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
