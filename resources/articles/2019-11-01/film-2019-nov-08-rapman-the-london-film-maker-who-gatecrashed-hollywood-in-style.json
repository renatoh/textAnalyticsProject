Nor do they have to juggle the advances of rival moguls before making their first film \u2013 or do so with an audience of 7.2 million people waiting for the results. Given all this, Rapman \u2013 the alias of the British rapper and film-maker Andrew Onwubolu \u2013 is surprisingly relaxed, a bright-eyed barrage of words in sweatshirt and black jeans on a cold afternoon in London. The 7.2 million in question are the viewers to date of Shiro\u2019s Story, the three-part drama he authored, whose phenomenal numbers on YouTube have led to a movie, Blue Story. The film is set in Lewisham, south London, where its writer-director grew up, but which he has since had to leave. \u201cDon\u2019t get it twisted,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority of people are happy for me. But you also get: \u2018What have you put in my individual pocket?\u2019 Until you can answer that, you can\u2019t live where you\u2019re from and feel safe.\u201d Onwubolu is a fluent talker, as anyone who has seen Shiro\u2019s Story knows, where his raps narrate a crime drama of family secrets and oh-no-they-didn\u2019t betrayal. This device is used again \u2013 more sparingly \u2013 in Blue Story. Still in place, too, are the seismic twists of fate that dogged Shiro, now driving a powerful tale of childhood friendship destroyed by a postcode war. Yet the director is aware of the gulf between YouTube clicks and ticket sales. \u201cAre people going to leave that comfy chair at home and the Netflix subscription? I don\u2019t know, man. I\u2019m nervous.\u201d For now, that cliffhanger is left to dangle. If Onwubolu has a brilliance for moreish storytelling, the past year of his life has shared the sense of whatever next? When the final instalment of Shiro\u2019s Story was released on a Sunday last September, he was dropping his oldest son off with his ex-partner. The first two episodes had drawn a significant audience under the radar of the mainstream. By the end of the half-hour journey, the views had reached 150,000. That evening, they hit a million. He woke to find the UK media anointing him an overnight sensation. On Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid told him: \u201cYou\u2019re making waves among a, you know, great audience.\u201d But palpable in the film and TV industry was a terror that their endless trawl for next big thing had somehow missed a writer-director able to build a vast fanbase \u2013 much of it young and of colour \u2013 entirely outside the system. Onwubolu took the chance to ask awkward questions. \u201cI said: \u2018Why aren\u2019t our stories on bigger platforms? Why are they not at the cinema? Why do we have to rush to our phones?\u2019\u201d His own phone erupted to the sound of panicked executives. There were back-to-back meetings with British production companies. Their plan was always the same \u2013 to remake Shiro\u2019s Story with their logo on the credits. Amid the promises in members\u2019 clubs, he met the producer Damian Jones, whose CV includes Noel Clarke\u2019s Kidulthood trilogy as well as the film work of Alan Bennett. \u201cHe was literally the only person who asked: \u2018What do you want to do next?\u2019\u201d The answer was direct Blue Story, a script he had written which was inspired by his childhood. Jones was keen, Onwubolu pragmatic. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, people talk a lot. So I\u2019m like: \u2018Cool. Let me know when there\u2019s a contract.\u2019\u201d The producer turned out to be briskly effective. Conversations took place with heavyweight potential backers, including international studios. One wheeled out an assembly of staff to say how much they loved his script. They seemed less sure about why. At another, a senior figure talked eagerly about Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje\u2019s biographical drama Farming. In the end, Onwubolu accepted an offer from BBC Films and the UK arm of the Hollywood studio Paramount. \u201cThey actually spoke about my writing in depth. They proper got it.\u201d Then, before the contract was finalised, came Jeffrey Katzenberg. The onetime chair of Disney and co-founder, with Steven Spielberg, of the studio DreamWorks, Katzenberg was busy with Quibi, the bleeding-edge platform for \u201csnackable\u201d content made to be watched on phones. He had already signed up film-makers including Spielberg, Jennifer Lopez and Guillermo del Toro before a 2020 launch. Katzenberg flew Onwubolu to LA, where his team read the script for Blue Story. They were polite, but insistent. \u201cThey said: \u2018We feel you should leave this and come to work with us here on short-form ideas. Straight away.\u2019 And then they offered me a lot of money.\u201d For the first time, he started to doubt his own judgment. \u201cMy agent is saying: \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay more?\u2019 He\u2019s just loving life. I\u2019ve got Damian back in London saying: \u2018Where\u2019s your signature?\u2019\u201d Onwubolu wondered aloud to Katzenberg about the speed of events. It had been mere weeks since Shiro\u2019s Story Part 3. \u201cI said: \u2018Shouldn\u2019t there be a bit in between?\u2019\u201d Just asking the question clarified his thinking. \u201cI said: \u2018Nah, I\u2019m making my movie. I know you lot don\u2019t get it, but the people it\u2019s intended for will.\u2019\u201d This could, he reasoned, be his only shot at the film. Katzenberg was gracious, his agent despondent. A week later, Quibi phoned to say they would wait for him. Onwubolu is now writing a project for Katzenberg. He is no longer with his agent. \u201cI haven\u2019t mentioned Jay-Z yet, have I?\u201d he asks. Still in LA, a meeting was brokered at the hip-hop magnate\u2019s home, finalising a deal that saw Onwubolu sign with his management company, Roc Nation. Jay-Z, it turned out, was one of the viewers of Shiro\u2019s Story. \u201cThat contract was never not getting signed.\u201d He relishes the story. The one he tells in his movie has a different tone. Blue Story is blue because Lewisham is the \u201cblue borough\u201d, council signs rendered in the colour. Yet at 11, his Nigerian parents sent him to a Catholic secondary school a bus ride away in Camberwell. Between the two was Peckham, delivering him daily into a bitter local rivalry. For many of his peers in Lewisham, growing up without role models, gang hierarchies were at least a structure, dominant personalities demanding loyalty from boys hungry to belong to something, even if only a postcode. Onwubolu\u2019s parents were loving; he mostly stayed out of trouble. But he was a sociable kid. His friends were his friends. He saddens discussing the violence he witnessed. \u201cWe\u2019d see a boy from Peckham and I\u2019d know we were meant to batter him. And I\u2019d think: \u2018But this kid never did anything to me.\u2019 I never had that dark heart.\u201d As his teens turned into his 20s, he tallied the acquaintances who had been stabbed and the friends in prison. He wanted a change of direction. He had rapped since school. Then, while working in JD Sports, he began to make a name for himself in London hip-hop with long, character-based rhymes. Catholic school had fuelled his gift for narrative. \u201cI\u2019m big on Bible stories. There\u2019s always a Judas in my stuff. But I\u2019m a sucker for plot generally. Might be Goodfellas; might be Desperate Housewives.\u201d For a film lover, video was a natural next step, although he wanted to do more than just accompany his tunes. In 2014, he learned his way around a camera, directing an early version of Blue Story with a beyond-skeletal crew. By 2017, he was debating what to do with a rap he had called Shiro\u2019s Story. \u201cI thought: \u2018Should I bother making a film for this?\u2019 But I wanted to test myself.\u201d His feature debut was another education. The \u00a31.3m budget sounded lavish compared with the \u00a33,000 with which he made Shiro\u2019s Story until, he says, crew members hired over his head ate up costs. Having always shot guerilla-style, he now diligently applied for the correct official permissions. The result was Lewisham council and others in London refusing to let Blue Story shoot in their boroughs, under instruction from the London mayor\u2019s office to withhold support from projects depicting knife and gun crime. It appeared filming would have to take place in Dartford, Kent, a location Onwubolu saw as laughably inappropriate. At the last minute, he was allowed to film in Enfield, north London, a passable stand-in. Onwubolu is still affronted. \u201cNo one in [London mayor] Sadiq Khan\u2019s office read the script! The heart of the film is that the good times only exist before the violence. If you see my film and tell me afterwards I\u2019ve glamorised gangs, I\u2019ll know you\u2019ve just been sitting there on Instagram.\u201d The irony for a mayor desperate to address youth violence was that here was a film that laid bare its tragedy and a director with the attention of the audience who most need to see it. \u201cStart preaching at a 15-year-old, and they ain\u2019t going to hear you. A film gets the message over wrapped inside a story.\u201d His exasperation passes. The moment is too exciting to be downbeat \u2013 a true original crashing an invitation-only party. \u201cThe same people have been running the industry in Britain for years,\u201d he says. \u201cThey decide what stories get told, and who gets hired to make them. But you know what\u2019s funny? When it turns out the person they never heard of is the perfect person for the job.\u201d Blue Story is released on 22 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
