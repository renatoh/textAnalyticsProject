However, Derby, who had the biggest crowd for the visit of Scunthorpe \u2013 26,106 \u2013 had to contend with boos rather than cheers from their fans as Nigel Clough's first anniversary as manager was marked by a 4-1 defeat. Clough recently described his task in transforming Derby into promotion contenders as a \"work in progress\". It certainly looked that way, with the poor defending that brought them their sixth home league defeat of the season, and Scunthorpe their first league away win since September. The stand-out player for Scunthorpe was their winger Garry Thompson, who scored two of the goals, his first in the Championship. Thompson, experiencing arguably his best spell since his move to Scunthorpe from Morecambe two years ago, came close to a hat-trick with a shot which was blocked. But the consolation for him was that at least Jonathan Forte scored Scunthorpe's fourth from the rebound. Few can have been surprised that Barnsley suffered their first league defeat in nine matches. The last time they achieved an away win over Coventry was 87 years and 19 matches ago. On this occasion, it looked as if they would break the jinx in the opening 25 minutes, when they dominated the attacking play and had the best chances. Stephen Foster was particularly unlucky not to put them ahead, first with an effort which was foiled by the keeper, Keiren Westwood, and then with a header which hit the woodwork. But Coventry then found the net twice in three minutes and went on to win 3-1. The biggest surprise was Leeds United's failure to put struggling Wycombe firmly in their place. The League One leaders did not look like the team who put Manchester United out of the FA Cup, and nor did Wycombe look like one in the second bottom spot. They did not make the best of starts, with slackness in their defence allowing Jonathan Howson to score from 20 yards after just four minutes. From that point, though, Wycombe looked the better team. In the first half, Wycombe's Jon-Paul Pittman and Scott Davies both hit the woodwork in quick succession but the lively Pittman produced an excellent finish to put them level. The Leeds manager, Simon Grayson, said: \"You have to give credit to Wycombe because they played very well but we were below the standards we normally set. However, you can't be at your best every game and at least we took a point.\" While Leeds maintained their unbeaten Elland Road record, Norwich recorded their ninth successive home win in overcoming Exeter 3-1. The visitors, who had to make the longest journey for the dubious privilege of being in action on a day like yesterday, can hardly have enjoyed their 300-mile trip home. The player who did the most damage to their defence was Grant Holt, who scored twice to bring his total for the season to 22. The match also highlighted the influence of Norwich midfielder Wes Hoolahan. Recently described by the Millwall manager as arguably the outstanding player in League One, Hoolahan provided further evidence of this by playing a part in all the goals against Exeter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
