Hartfield's cavalier approach offers no viable solution to our housing crisis. In the immediate postwar period we built millions of suburban houses, in the process turning our city centres into ghettos and eroding our precious countryside. We must learn from these errors by creating vibrant, well-designed and higher density inner-city neighbourhoods that will also safeguard what remains of our rural landscape. There is nothing \"reactionary\" about demanding better designed housing. Good design is all about responsible forward planning - the imaginative use of existing land is fundamental in an area as densely populated as England's south-east. Richard Rogers London \u00b7 James Hartfield asserts that environmental sustainability is being used as an excuse not to develop sufficient housing stock. But building environmentally sound housing is not an option, it is a requirement we can ill afford to sideline. About half the UK's carbon dioxide emissions - the main contributor to climate change - is caused by the energy used in constructing, maintaining and occupying buildings, with homes alone accounting for 28%. Yet, it has been revealed that most houses built today do not meet thermal efficiency standards - we are literally throwing heat away through leaking windows, doors and roofs. There is no reason that sustainable homes should take longer to build or should not be affordable - the additional costs, when spread across a large development, are marginal. Philip Sellwood Chief executive, Energy Saving Trust \u00b7 James Hartfield believes \"the banners are put away\" after the East of England regional assembly's proposal to build nearly half a million homes in this region. He could not be further from the truth. The protest group banners have been out in force in Hertfordshire since last November. We are in for a long fight over these unsustainable and unnecessary building plans that will blight the south-east for decades. Nigel Clark Secretary, Stop Harlow North \u00b7 The Edinburgh vote is very bad news but hardly surprising: people in liberal capitalist societies never vote for taxes (Edinburgh says no to road toll, February 23). Contrary to Andrew Clark's view, this government's green and collective instincts are far too shallow for it ever to argue the point of view of environmental citizenship. So the environment will be left to go to hell in a handcart, and the health and wellbeing of citizens of Edinburgh, Cardiff, Manchester etc will be sacrificed to the god of individual choice. (Prof) Andrew Dobson Department of government and politics, Open University \u00b7 Andrew Clark suggests \"the only alternative [to congestion] is managing demand by charging for road space\". There are a number of other ways in which travellers can retain the freedom to travel when and where they like without being taxed to do so. What about encouraging bicycles? What about promoting motorcycles and scooters? We need to get away from the current transport policy, which seems to have only two strands: tax and restrict. The car is certainly not the only way forward - but neither is taxing people on to public transport.
