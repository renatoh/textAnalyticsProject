Collier has made no public appearance or statement since the exams regulator announced it would ditch its grading algorithm, two days after education secretary Gavin Williamson said there would be \u201cno U-turn, no change\u201d. She faces a grilling from MPs on the education select committee alongside Ofqual chair Roger Taylor when the Commons reconvenes in early September. The committee, whose chair, Conservative MP Robert Halfon has been one of the harshest critics of the exams fiasco, is also expected to quiz Williamson in mid-September. There has been speculation among education sources about Collier\u2019s future in recent days, as she has remained absent from the public eye. An Ofqual spokesperson said on Thursday evening: \u201cSally Collier remains in her post as chief regulator for Ofqual.\u201d Labour has called on the government to publish all its correspondence about the regulator\u2019s discredited algorithm, to \u201crestore trust\u201d after the crisis. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has written to the cabinet secretary, urging him to make public correspondence and other documents that would allow detailed scrutiny of the events leading up to last week\u2019s botched A-level results. \u201cThe chaos, confusion, and lack of clarity around the actions of the department are unfair and disrespectful to the thousands of young people who are affected, and undermine trust in politics and politicians. Urgent action must be taken to rectify this,\u201d she wrote. Green said: \u201cGavin Williamson was warned again and again about the problems with the grading algorithm, and time and time again, he did nothing.\u201d Education select committee member and Labour MP Kim Johnson said Williamson will face questions on why the committee\u2019s July report on the likelihood of problems with A-levels was ignored. She said: \u201cWe thought there would be problems but this was much worse than expected. I will be asking Williamson why was there a decision to change from centre assessed grades [schools\u2019 recommendations] to the algorithm which has caused such mayhem. I want to know what advice and support he received later to change his mind? How was this model tested? \u201cAlso I\u2019d want to ask him where\u2019s his boss been? Boris has been absent \u2013 not a word. And for Ofqual, they knew it was going to be a problem months ago so why did they not take advice? Why did they decide to go down that route?\u201d Williamson initially heaped blame on the exams regulator as he announced the algorithm had been dropped, claiming he had only become aware of the scale of the problems at the weekend. He then appeared to change course, issuing a statement on Wednesday saying he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d, in Ofqual. Schools minister Nick Gibb \u2013 who is also expected to be called to give evidence to the committee, according to Westminster sources \u2013 apologised for the mess on Thursday. Gibb\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with avoiding grade inflation has been blamed by some Tory MPs for the drastic downgrades administered by Ofqual\u2019s model. He apologised on Thursday, saying: \u201cTo those hundreds of thousands of young people receiving their GCSE grades and the A-level students receiving recalculated grades, I will say this to them: congratulations on what you have achieved. But also how sorry I am for the pain, the anxiety and the uncertainty that they will have suffered as a consequence of the grading issues we encountered last week.\u201d Pressure on Williamson from Tory colleagues remains intense, with the party\u2019s new Scottish leader Douglas Ross suggesting he needed to \u201creflect\u201d on the crisis. Ross is the most high-profile Tory to speak out publicly on Williamson\u2019s future since the grades debacle erupted. Asked whether he supported Williamson staying on in his job, Ross told BBC Radio Scotland: \u201cThat is a decision for Gavin Williamson. It\u2019s a decision for the prime minister, if he continues to have the trust of the prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say in your report that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue. I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England, students who were concerned for four days, because we had the exact same up here in Scotland for a week.\u201d Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chair of the powerful Commons liaison committee, said he was concerned that when a problem arises, \u201cit is never the government\u2019s fault\u201d. He said \u201cthere is a sort of pattern setting in\u201d under Boris Johnson\u2019s government where \u201csomething goes wrong and it is the permanent secretary\u2019s fault or it is some public body\u2019s fault\u201d. Johnson is on holiday in Scotland this week. He is expected to return to his desk in Downing Street on Monday. The exams U-turn was the latest in a series of reversals made by the government in recent weeks, with others including free school meals, and the visa surcharge for migrant workers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
