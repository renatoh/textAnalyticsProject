Bosnich, who tested positive for cocaine in November, had told the Premier League tribunal, consisting of the Premier League chairman Dave Richards, secretary Mike Foster and solicitor Peter McCormack, that Chelsea acted improperly in the waythey had dismissed him. Bosnich argued that the club could not give him his notice before the Football Association had decided on the issue of his guilt and whether he had contravened its rules by taking a banned substance. The goalkeeper, who was suspended without pay by Chelsea before the club then terminated his contract, is due to attend an FA disciplinary hearing next week. A Premier League statement said: \"In the matter of the appeal from Mark Bosnich against the notice to terminate his contract issued by Chelsea FC, the board of the Premier League has found in favour of the club. \"Mark Bosnich has the right to appeal against this decision to the Football League appeals committee within seven days. Any appeal must be heard within 14 days of receiving the request.\" Bosnich's failure to admit he knowingly took cocaine went against him during the hearing, which took place last Thursday and Friday before members considered their judgment over the weekend. Chelsea insisted Bosnich had breached the terms of his employment under Premier League rules. They would have been liable to compensate him for \u00a3300,000 back pay and possibly the rest of his contract had the hearing gone the other way. \"We're going to study the judgment and will then decide whether to appeal within the timescale,\" said a source close to Bosnich. Derby County, who have sold nine players this season to reduce their debt, are set to sell a 10th with their defender Fran\u00e7ois Grenet going to Rennes, where he has been on loan since August, for \u00a31m. The deal means Derby will lose \u00a31.2m on the player, signed by Colin Todd from Bordeaux in November 2001. James Beattie, hoping for an England call-up on Saturday after his scoring feats, has signed a new contract which will tie him to Southampton until 2006. His previous deal was set to expire in 2005. Everton have taken one trophy from their city rivals Liverpool after their manager David Moyes was named Merseyside Sports Personality of the Year for 2002. G\u00e9rard Houllier won it last year.
