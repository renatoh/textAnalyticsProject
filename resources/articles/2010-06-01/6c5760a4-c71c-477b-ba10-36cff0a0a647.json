Chris is a former director general of Cern and was instrumental in creating the Large Hadron Collider. He's now chair of the council of SESAME (Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East). Chris updates us on progress in the field of nuclear fusion, and reveals some fascinating details about his time at Cern. Our own science correspondent Ian Sample has written a book about the LHC's quest for the Higgs boson, Massive: The Hunt for the God Particle. He was happy to tell us all about it. Producer Andy visited the new Skin exhibition at London's Wellcome Collection, where he got to wear a \"social condom\". We also highlight an experiment in science journalism we are carrying out on our website. Story Tracker. It might just revolutionise the way we cover major science stories. After reading nearly all of the documents at the centre of the University of East Anglia hacked emails furore, Guardian environment writer Fred Pearce wrote a book that is billed as the definitive account of the scandal. The Climate Files is out this week. Listen to James Randerson's interview with Fred in full in the latest Science Weekly Extra podcast. Finally, next weekend is Science Hack Weekend: Get Excited and Make Things with Science! at the Guardian's offices in King's Cross, London. Bring your own bunsen burner. (Actually, don't.) What is Science Hack Weekend? According to the organisers: \"A bunch of geeks get together in the same physical space to collaborate and create awesome things, usually by mashing up APIs. A Hack Day is usually 48 hours long and involves a sleepover ...although not much sleeping happens when everyone is either hacking or playing Werewolf.\" Follow the podcast on our Science Weekly Twitter feed and receive updates on all breaking science news stories from Guardian Science.
