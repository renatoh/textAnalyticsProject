The Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints after users of a game called Looney Tunes World of Mayhem were invited to view adverts for the betting companies in exchange for \u201cgems\u201d, tokens used to purchase in-game items. In each case, users were asked to deposit a minimum of \u00a310 in a gambling account in order to receive the gems. \u201cGiven the use of cartoon characters, cartoonish violence and the relatively simple nature of the game, we considered it was likely to appeal to many under-18s,\u201d the regulator said. The ASA previously banned a gambling advert that appeared in an app linked to the ITV programme I\u2019m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, after the Guardian reported concern about its potential impact on children from figures including the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson. Both William Hill and Paddy Power said the appearance of their adverts in the Looney Tunes game was the fault of Tapjoy, a US mobile advertising company. Tapjoy told the ASA that it had accidentally labelled the game as suitable for \u201cmature gambling\u201d advertising and had now corrected the error, preventing it from appearing again. It played down the appeal to children of the Looney Tunes game, in which players choose characters such as Porky Pig and Road Runner and battle each other using comic weapons. \u201cTapjoy said that while adults of a certain age associated the Looney Tunes characters with their own childhood, the app in question used characters and entertainment properties dating back to the 1930s and 1940s,\u201d the ASA said in its ruling. The ASA said Tapjoy had also pointed to the Pegi 7 rating on the game, which indicated the \u201cminimum\u201d maturity level required to play the game, not necessarily the age group at which it was targeted. Tapjoy also pointed out that its platform allows advertisers to focus their campaigns more narrowly by making use of data about users\u2019 other preferences and self-reported demographic details, but that neither William Hill nor Paddy Power chose this option. The company said it had a \u201clongstanding policy prohibiting the use of Tapjoy with child users or apps directed toward children\u201d and had corrected the mistake as soon as it was discovered. But the Labour MP Carolyn Harris, a longtime campaigner on gambling, said: \u201cI am deeply concerned that online gambling companies are marketing their products at children and enticing them to gamble. This is wholly unacceptable.\u201d Marc Etches, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s leading gambling charity GambleAware, said: \u201cThe issues highlighted in this ASA ruling rightly underlines that it is unacceptable for children to be exposed to gambling online.\u201d Scopely, the publisher of Looney Tunes World of Mayhem, said the ad went against its advertising policies and such ads were strictly prohibited under its contracts with its advertising partners. The company also told the ASA that it did not target games at children and was \u201cnot aware of any children playing Looney Tunes World of Mayhem.\u201d The ASA said the adverts must not appear again without more effective tools to ensure that they are not seen by children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
