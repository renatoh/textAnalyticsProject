The \u00a32.4bn scheme \u2013 which will see the traffic-choked road to the west country widened into a dual carriageway near the ancient site before shooting down a two-mile tunnel \u2013 has pitted archaeologists, local campaigners and even the nation\u2019s druids against the combined might of Highways England, English Heritage and the National Trust. Professor Mike Parker Pearson, whose archaeological digs have transformed current thinking about the purpose of Stonehenge, fears the scheme will cause irreparable damage to a still largely unexplored ancient landscape. \u201cThe world heritage site where Stonehenge sits is over 5km long but the tunnel is under 3km. This means a dual carriageway will emerge from both portals within this unique and protected landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be almost total destruction of all archaeological remains within its path.\u201d Pearson, who is a member of Highways England\u2019s independent A303 scientific committee, says the agency\u2019s contractors will only be expected to retrieve 4% of artefacts in the ploughed soil during construction. \u201cWe are looking at losing about half a million artefacts \u2013 they will be machined off without recording. You could say \u2018they are just a bunch of old flints\u2019 but they tell us about the use of the Stonehenge landscape over the millennia,\u201d he said. The western end of the tunnel will, he claims, erase most of the remains of a camp which may have been used by the builders of Stonehenge. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at prehistory, the buried remains are the only evidence we have. It\u2019s rather like burning ancient manuscripts,\u201d says Pearson, who has been excavating the site since 2004. The Unesco World Heritage Committee, which designates areas of exceptional importance to humanity, has warned that the current scheme will \u201cimpact adversely\u201d on the Stonehenge landscape because the tunnel is too short. Local resident Kate Fielden, who has been campaigning against tunnel proposals for over 20 years, says landscape surrounding Stonehenge will be \u201ctrashed\u201d by gouging out a vast trench for the dual carriageway. \u201cIt is too depressing. It\u2019s not just that a world heritage site will be spoiled for ever, but my greater sadness is that our government should care so little about something which means so much to so many people,\u201d she said. Fielden, a retired curator, who regularly walks the chalk downland around Stonehenge, says opponents of the scheme haven\u2019t decided what to do if Shapps gives the go-ahead but she is prepared to put herself in harm\u2019s way. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling out lying in front of a bulldozer, but that\u2019s a long way down the line,\u201d she said. She is not the only one willing to protest. King Arthur Pendragon, one of most senior druids in Britain, says he would join her in front of any bulldozers. \u201cNever mind Boris Johnson threatening to do it at Heathrow Airport, I have actually done it, I\u2019m known for doing it,\u201d he said. The light that could be cast by vehicles entering the tunnel also worries druids like Pendragon. \u201cThe light pollution from the western portal is in line with the sunset at the winter solstice,\u201d he said. \u201cStonehenge was built for that purpose and that\u2019s what it is used for to this day. Druids and pilgrims won\u2019t come if the tunnel is there because there will be nothing to observe any more.\u201d The scheme\u2019s supporters take a very different view. Anna Eavis, English Heritage\u2019s curatorial director, whose responsibilities include Stonehenge, argues the tunnel will join up the ancient features cut off by the road and allow people to enjoy Stonehenge in peace. \u201cIf you stand by the stones at the moment all you can see to the south is a great queue of vehicles. It is noisy and smelly and it looks awful,\u201d she said. Eavis adds the line of the road has already been archaeologically evaluated: \u201cWe already have a good idea of what\u2019s there and there will be a full programme of mitigation to ensure that any archaeology that isn\u2019t preserved in situ is fully recorded.\u201d Highways England, which has devised the plan, says it is the best way of tackling congestion. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that the proposed scheme presents the best solution for tackling the longstanding bottleneck on this section of the A303, returning the Stonehenge landscape to something like its original setting and helping to boost the south-west economy,\u201d said Derek Parody, the project\u2019s director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
