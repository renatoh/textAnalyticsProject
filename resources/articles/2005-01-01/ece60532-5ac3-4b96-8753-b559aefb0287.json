An independent commission appointed by the Premier League decided that Villa had breached league rules after their manager David O'Leary said last summer of Beattie, who was then at Southampton: \"There is a player there who wants to join us.\" However, the commission stopped short of fining Villa and instead gave them the smallest possible punishment after hearing evidence from O'Leary and the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe among others. Villa were ordered to pay the costs of all parties, including those of the Premier League. The Premier League indicated its disappointment when it said in a statement: \"The Premier League board considers these offences to be of a very serious nature and any club found guilty of them would normally face a significant financial sanction.\" Southampton are surprised by the sanction imposed, though Lowe stressed: \"There is no malice between the clubs and we bear them no ill will. I wished David O'Leary all the best for the rest of the season and he did the same in return.\" O'Leary ultimately missed out on the striker, who chose to sign for Everton this month. Liverpool were fined \u00a320,000 by a Premier League commission in March 2002 for making an illegal approach for Christian Ziege before he joined them from Middlesbrough. Yesterday's commission concluded that it was dealing with an \"unusual case with a number of mitigating factors\". They heard that O'Leary, who had described the charge as a \"farce\", was not aware of the rules, which stipulate that there should be no \"statement made publicly by, or on behalf of, a club expressing interest in acquiring the registration of a contract player\" without permission. Villa also stressed that O'Leary had merely been responding to questions raised by the media at the time and that it was plain Southampton were willing to listen to bids for Beattie. \"We are disappointed,\" said a Villa spokesman, Phil Mepham, but he acknowledged that they had \"a fair hearing\" and \"the lowest possible punishment\" and that they would \"accept it and move on\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
