Mario Marcelo Santoro was arrested for the murder of Cecilia Haddad on 7 July in Rio de Janeiro, after Haddad\u2019s body was found in the Lane Cove River in Sydney. Both Santoro and Haddad are from Brazil but were living in Australia. Santoro appeared in handcuffs before the court and remained for the first testimony before being dismissed. Fabio Cardoso, the deputy director of Rio\u2019s homicide department said: \u201cIn an informal conversation, he confirmed the entire dynamic of the homicide.\u201d The police officer\u2019s testimony said Santoro admitted to having an argument with Haddad and strangling her to death. He then left the house and returned about two hours later returned and disposed of her body in Lane Cove River. The testimony added that Santoro said he was telling this story \u201cinformally\u201d and that he would only give his formal testimony with lawyers present. However, when Santoro did have legal representation, he refused to answer questions. The court heard from family members who described Haddad as a happy, hard-working young woman, who loved ballet and scuba diving and was a successful corporate executive. They said she had fallen into an emotionally abusive relationship and was fearful of Santoro, who refused to leave her home and stalked her in public. The victim\u2019s father, Jos\u00e9 Haddad, said he spoke by phone with Cecilia Haddad the day before the murder, after she had spent a few days away from her home. Afraid Santoro would be there, she kept her father on the line while she opened the door. \u201cShe told me: \u2018Dad, he\u2019s not here, you can go to bed now,\u2019\u201d Jos\u00e9 Haddad said, holding back tears. Cecilia Haddad\u2019s stepmother, Andrea Haddad, also testified, saying that the victim had been long suffering \u201cpsychological violence,\u201d and that she recalled her calling her crying uncontrollably saying: \u201cI can\u2019t live like this anymore.\u201d The victim\u2019s brother, Jo\u00e3o Haddad, gave the fourth and final testimony of the day. He described Santoro as threatening and chauvinistic and said his sister lived in fear of him. He said he saw red flags in Santoro\u2019s obsessive behaviour monitoring Cecilia Haddad\u2019s communication, oftentimes taking her phone and computer. Jo\u00e3o Haddad said his sister had blocked Santoro on all communication methods and only exchanged emails with him. She began to only write to him in English purposefully to leave evidence that Australian authorities could quickly understand. In his testimony, Jo\u00e3o Haddad recounted several times asking his sister why she didn\u2019t just make him leave or call the police, to which she responded that she was both afraid and also felt bad because Santoro was unemployed at the time. When Jo\u00e3o Haddad found out that Cecilia Haddad was missing, he said he called Santoro\u2019s mother, who said her son was not in Brazil. But just five minute later, Santoro called Jo\u00e3o Haddad saying that he was indeed in Brazil. He then received another phone call from Santoro\u2019s mother saying Santoro was in Brazil and that she was taking a medication and had been confused. \u201cI could hear [Santoro\u2019s] voice in the background telling her what to say,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Haddad said. At least two other witnesses will testify in the pre-trial hearing, including Cecilia Haddad\u2019s mother and her ex-husband. No date has been set for Santoro\u2019s trial. If convicted, Santoro may face up to 30 years in one of Brazil\u2019s notoriously violent prisons. Kayakers discovered Haddad\u2019s fully clothed body near Woolwich in Sydney on 29 April, about the same time her former live-in lover, Santoro, flew home to Rio de Janeiro. Investigators confirmed in May that Haddad had asked Santoro to move out of her Ryde apartment, in Sydney\u2019s north-west, in the weeks before her death. The Brazilian-born Haddad arrived in Australia more than a decade ago and had moved to Sydney in 2016 where she worked for a mining and logistics company in Western Australia. She had moved to New South Wales to work as a logistics manager for a freight company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
