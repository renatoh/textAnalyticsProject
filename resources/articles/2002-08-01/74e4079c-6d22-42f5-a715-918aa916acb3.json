Not sure who's got this gig tomorrow, but it's not me. I'm off. 85th over: England 264-9 A misfield from Tendulkar gifts Stewart a four and he moves to 71. Kumble's not a happy chappy. India appeal on the last ball but our Alec survives. 84th over: England 260-9 A single for Stewart puts Hoggard into play for three Harbhajan balls. Somehow he survives and Stewart has strike for that last over. One more left. That's six balls. 83rd over: England 259-9 A single off Kumble takes Stewart to all the sixes, 66. I'm going to make a bold prediction. England are going to be forced to follow on. Two overs left. That's 12 balls. 82nd over: England 258-9 Are England rubbish? England are rubbish, rubbish are England, England rubbish are. It's gone 7pm now. Let me go home. I'm going bonkers live online. Stewart takes a single which puts the rabbit back in the headlights. Caddick panics. He loses his head and his wicket when a Harbie top-spin special clips his bails off. Caddick goes for a princely one. Hoggard is the last man in. If he goes for a duck now, then we can all go home. Do it Hoggie. Do it for me. 81st over: England 257-8 Kumble to Caddick. A maiden. Kumble has got a foot injury and is limping about pathetically. The light is improving. My hand is not. Four overs left and I'm counting them down. 80th over: England 257-8 Not much hope for Caddick here. He's only passed 20 once in his last 33 test innings. A single from Stewart takes him to 64. An inside edge from Caddick gets him off the mark in suitably streaky style. 79th over: England 255-8 Good work from Giles but his fight is over. Kumble has him lbw for 25, although Hawk Eye disputes umpire Orchard's decision. That's the end of a decent partnership that was worth 70 runs. Andy Caddick's has got his lugholes squeezed into a helmet and he is striding out to join Stewart. Six overs left. England are 373 runs behind. 78th over: England 249-7 This commentary is bobbins now. Apologies. Ten of Khan's over, including two fours for Stewart which have taken him to yet another landmark - 25,000 first class runs. Very few batsmen can boast that. This has been a good knock from the young man. 77th over: England 239-7 Harbie to Stewie. He gets two lots of two runs to bring up both his 50 and the 50 partnership with Giles. Jolly good. It's looking awfully dark out there to me, umpires. Time to call it a day, I reckon. 76th over: England 232-7 The umpires arew consulting about the light. They make another bad decision and opt to carry on. Three runs off the over from Khan. Stewart nears that 50. He's on 47. 75th over: England 229-7 Harbhajan to Giles. Four runs. Better still, two lights on the light meter. Oh please oh please. 74th over: England 223-7 A maiden from Kumble. There are still 11 overs to go. Ye gads. 73rd over: England 223-7 One run to Giles off Harbie. He's making a nuisance of himself, is our Ashley. \"Stop whining Dan,\" says Ramblax in Noo Joy-zee. Git. \"Only the weather is going to save England,\" he adds. I was kind of hoping it was going to save my hand too. (I said that without whining, by the way.) 72nd over: England 223-7 A Kumble maiden. And that makes me a happy man. The fewer incidents, the better. Anand S Iyer wants me to keep the naff gags coming. I'll keep them coming as fast as my little hands can type them. Which at the moment isn't very fast at all. Did I mention my RSI? David Orchard looks worryingly like Chelsea chairman Ken Bates. I'd find it very off-putting if I was playing. 71st over: England 223-7 Lovely shot from the Gaffer there. He makes some room for himself, picks a gap between the close fielders, and slashes it hard to the point fence. Tonk! The scoreboard is ticking over. And I've just remembered that I've not called my girlfriend when I promised I would. 70th over: England 216-7 A rare boundary for Giles off Kumble. But it is Stewart who is taking the strain in this partnership - a bit like my right hand. 69th over: England 209-7 Two runs of Harbhajan. England are still 220 runs behind their follow-on target though. It's not looking good. 68th over: England 207-7 Consecutive boundaries for Stewart bring the 200 up for England. Good work, sir. Andrew Burns says I need voice recognition software to ease the pain. Too true. Ten runs off Agarkar's over. 67th over: England 197-7 Two runs off Harbhajan. I can't do this much longer. I'm doing a rain dance here but there's not a cloud in the sky. 66th over: England 195-7 A four for Stewart off Agarakar. He's on 26 now, Giles has four. England are 433 runs adrift. Shyam Sundararaman has emailed in from the States. \"I have followed this Indian team for 10 years and 80-odd Tests. Do not worry, India will not win. It'll be a bit like the last time India enforced the follow on against England at the Oval in 90.\" I wouldn't bet on it, but then India have failed to win a single Test away from home when they scored more than 500 in an innings. Which is bizarre, isn't it? 65th over: England 190-7 One legbye off Harbhajan. I've asked around to see if anyone has any pain killers and I've been given a Hedex tablet. Hope it's fast-working. 64th over: England 189-7 Out! Agarkar mocks Tudor (do you see what I've done there? May have a sore hand but the naff gags keep acoming) with a ball that shapes away. He edges it to Sehwag in the skips and goes for just one. Ashley Giles has moved up the order to come in next. He starts promisingly with a four. 63rd over: England 185-6 Two fours to Stewart off Harbhajan. Can't type. It hurts. He moves to 22, Tudor is still on one. 62nd over: England 177-6 Agarakar dives but cannot cut off four legbyes. Looks like he'll have rope burn on his chest after that. 61st over: England 173-6 Another Harbie maiden. Top man. 60th over: England 173-6 A four for Stewart and a couple of no-balls. David Hughes says he'll do the commentary. \"130th over: England 594-5 Excellent! With his fifth consecutive six, Stewart pushes England into the lead. Good job I cancelled the holiday - wouldn't miss this for the world.\" David, you're dreaming. That'll never happen. I'd never cancel my holiday. 59th over: England 166-6 A maiden from Harbhajan. He owed me that. 58th over: England 166-6 Tudor gets his first run. Stewart adds one too. Forgive me for being a bit light on detail now. (Why change the habit of a lifetime? I hear you ask.) I've got Rev Keith Hudosn parying for rain for me. Thank you, Keith. Could you pray for my hand too? 57th over: England 164-6 Well thank you very much Turbanator. He waits till my hand cramp is more severe than a horny 13-year-old boy's before doing this: First, he gets rid of Crawley. He tries to work the ball away but it kisses the face as he turns his wrist and Laxman takes a smart catch in the slips to make up for that howler before. Flintoff comes to the middle and these are his stats: 1 ball, 1 minute, 0 runs. He doesn't offer a shot and even though Hawk Eye suggests the ball would not have hit the stumps (I'm doing bad Ali G impressions with my hand to cure this RSI here), the umpire had no option but to give him lbw. Great excitement with Harbhajan on a hat-trick. Alex Tudor is visibly filling his cricket box with fear. There are six catchers around him, but he survives. Owwwwccchhh! 56th over: England 163-4 Six runs coming off the over but I am down to just my left hand now so no details. And I'm not even sorry. Botheration, I'm behind now. 55th over: England 157-4 Good news for Aprajit Mahajan - Harbhajan is coming on at last. Just two runs come off him. Am not sure if I can last another hour. News just in: England will send a full strength squad to next month's ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka, as we always knew they would. Typical - they follow the Indians in boycotting, then they follow the Aussies in going back. They're incapable of making an independent decision, it seems. 54th over: England 155-4 That's more like it - seven runs for Crawley off the bowling of Khan, including a four. He moves to 11. Stewart is stuck on three. Crawley takes a risky single on the last ball. Had it been a direct hit, he would have been out. Silly billy. My right hand is beginning to hurt. Lots. 4,340 words so far. Can someone else take over from home? Watch Channel 4 or listen to Radio 4 and email in what you see/hear. Ta. 53rd over: England 148-4 A maiden from Kumble. It's a bit dull at the moment, if truth be told. David Hughes has written in from sunny Sweden to tell me to be more positive about England's chances and also to tell me that Graveney visited his school once and seemed \"a very nice guy\". I've just heard that they are going on till 7pm tonight. Will my RSI hold off? 52nd over: England 148-4 Three more runs off Khan's over but I missed them all. It's getting hot in here. I'd taking Nelly's advice (\"so take off all your clothes\") but I'm a modest man. Tame Aline (Mr) is back. \"Good news!\" he beings. \"The shelf is up in the kitchen, and the spice jars are neatly arranged. And I hung a picture on the wall, so Munkhey and I feel justified in sitting down with a beer to read the commentary - keep it going!\" You know, I'm tapping away with renewed impetus, having read that. 51st over: England 145-4 Wahey! Stewart gets off zero finally. He edges one to gully. He's on two, Crawley is on three and England are only 483 runs behind. Ah rubbish. Arsenal got an equaliser, like Man Utd did last night. It could have been such a good weekend too. I hate Freddie Kanoute. Still, at least LFC are top of the Premiership tonight. 50th over: England 142-4 It's slow progress at the moment. Crawley managed to extract one more run from Khan. Alec \"life begins at 39\" Stewart has yet to score. Pete Horn's cronies are currently in the Old Swan in Netherton, home of Ma Pardoe's. Gary Partington is about a mile from Headingley and it hasn't rained a drop where he is. The stage manager in the sky obviously knew I needed a bit of a break. It's tough doing this on your own, you know. Danny Murphy has added a third for Liverpool. I am a very happy man. If West ham can hold on, I'll be happier still. 49th over: England 141-4 Crawley works one away through the on side to get off the mark. Arsenal are running out of time. Keith Hudson's sermon is about space and infinity. \"It's a bit hard to say anything about infinity, I find. A good (appropriate) joke would help?\" I would have thought there would be no end of things to say about infinity, Keith. 48th over: England 140-4 Oh dear. England are in trouble. Hussain is out, lbw off the bowling off Khan. He walks with 25 to his name. Crawley has yet to get off the mark so, with Alec Stewart joining him, there are two very green batsmen at the crease now. 47th over: England 140-3 Kumble to Crawley. A maiden. Arsenal are losing 2-1 to West Ham and Kanoute just missed a penalty, the idiot. 46th over: England 140-3 Khan is testing the umpires' patience once more. He was warned twice in the last Test for scuffing up the strip with his follow through and he's doing it again here. Hussain doesn't care though and the England captain pulls him, so to speak, emphatically for four. AFC Wimbledon got a bigger crowd than Wimbledon FC today, by the way. 45th over: England 135-3 One run of Kumble's over to Hussain. Alan Leece is still in the office. He has sent me a face with a tongue sticking out. It looks like this :-P He has also sent me another prediction: Liverpool to win this afternoon and Diouf to pick up a hat-trick and get sent off for diving twice. Well, that could be on because Diouf has just scored hsi second, and we know how he loves to dive. Top bomby! (for fans of the other Peter Kay John Smith's ad in the swimming pool.) 4.30pm: email interlude Ramesh Shotham asks whether I think India will have levelled the series by Monday. Yes. Aprajit Mahajan asks whether I know why they haven't brought 'Budgie' on. No. Vic, one of the Black Country beer monsters has asked whether I can take text message direct. Vic, I would give you my personal number, but I fear a heavy CAMRA night might see me plagued by drunken \"Iloveyou,Ireallyreallyloveyou\" calls later on. CAMRA, I'm told, stands for the Campaign for Real Ale (or the Campaign for Rotten 'Angovers as Pete Horn's head knows it.) The players are back in the middle. Good oh. Keep the emails coming. 4.15pm latest: Still no sign of the umpires, but they're taking the covers off and it looks pretty bright once again. Oh, we've just heard that play is due to resume again at 4.30pm. They'd best not extend play for too long tonight because I'm supposed to be going on holiday for a couple of days tonight. In the meantime, allow me to entertain you with a couple of emails, like they might on Test Match Special when they're having to waffle their way through a rain break. 4pm latest: Okay, so I took a shopkeeper's liberty with my 'back in 20 minutes' claim. But don't blame me, blame the black clouds which have emptied themselves all over Headingley. The good ol' English summer, eh? The rain seems to have stopped now though, so they should be taking the covers off soon. I'm looking forward to a few comedy mis-fields in the wet when we come back. 3.30pm: early tea Back in 20 minutes. Byeee! 44th over: England 134-3 Agarkar to the new man Crawley. He can't get off the mark, though and the rain is back. In fact it is falling quite heavily so the umpires elect to take an early tea and give it 20 minutes to blow over. Keith Hudson hasn't time to read this gubbins because he's doing his sermon again. As far as I'm aware, Kieth, my old man never played in the Church Times Cup. He is more of a football and rugby man. What's the sermon about this week? Anything we can help with? 43rd over: England 134-3 Kumble to Hussain. Four runs! \"Have it!\" (said in Peter Kay's voice off the John Smith's ad.) Pete Horn has sent in a text messge from his beer-swilling mates. It reads: \"Hi to Dan from the CAMRA crowd in the Beacon Hotel in Sedgeley. Beer is pretty fine.\" Isn't that a warming moment. 42nd over: England 130-3 Oh dear. Michael Vaughan has gone for 61, and with him go England's chances, I fear. High drama. First of all, Vaughan is dropped by three India fielders. He gets an edge. Patel parries it, Laxman muffs it and Dravid tries to compensate for them both but can't quite get a hand on it in time. But no matter, because the very next ball, Vaughan lofts one up beautifully for Sehwag to snaffle at cover. Ganguly celebrates like he'd just won the World Cup. On his own. Crawley is the next man in and there is a lot of work to do. 41st over: England 130-2 One run off Kumble's over. I'm having a breather. Tame Alien (Mr) is supposed to be putting up shelves today, but instead he's reading this. I can see two kids having a fight from here. 40th over: England 129-2 Just one run off Agarkar's over. Vaughan is on 60, Hussain is on 16. Get in! Diouf has just scored his first league goal for Liverpool against Southampton after only three minutes. 39th over: England 128-2 Another four to Hussain. I didn't see it though I'm afraid and my monitor is not showing me the replay. Let's just say it was a cover drive shall we? 38th over: England 124-2 Four runs to Nasser, but it was a strange sort of shot. The ball hits the bat and pings over the slips down to the third man fence. A better shot from Nas brings three more runs. 37th over: England 117-2 Two runs to Vaughan and a no-ball from Kumble. It's still pretty tense out there. Lots of eye-balling. Pete Horn is going to get his mates, who are on a pub crawl around the Black Country, to send in some text messages to him, which he'll forward on to me in an email. Now that's what I call interactive commentary, vol 6! 36th over: England 114-2 I'm not the only one having a rough time today. The umpires are having a shocker too. It's umpire Asoka de Silva's turn now. He loses count on Agarkar's over and makes him bowl a seven-baller. Earlier, Hussain takes one on the glove of that troublesome hand and, ooh, it smarts. He tries to play the next ball but misses and it raps him on the pads. Another maiden from Agarkar and I've finally caught up. 35th over: England 114-2 Hussain cleverly tries to calm things down - which is a relief to me as much as anyone else. Just the one run for him off Kumble's over. He moves to four and Vaughan is on 57. It is essential that these two bed down, so to speak, otherwise England will be in serious trouble. 34th over: England 113-2 Still catching up after that crash. Thankfully, Agarkar helps me out by bowling an uneventful maiden. The rain seems to have stopped, by the way. It was just a brief, gentle shower. 33rd over: England 113-2 Oh dear. Now we've got rain. But the umpire is playing on. And that's good news for India who are fired up here. Anil Kumble has channelled his anger and Mark Butcher is the victim of it. That's plumb lbw and this time umpire Orchard gets his finger out. Butcher goes for 16. Nasser Hussain is in and immediately gets runs with a jammy edge which flies for four. 32nd over: England 109-1 What a response from Vaughan! He cracks one away through point for four. Superb shot. But India are very angry. They feel they have been wronged, and rightly so. 31st over: England 105-1 Great. My computer would have to break down just when we've got the most exciting over of the day. Now that I'm back up and running, let me talk you through it. Kumble's first ball is harshly adjudged to be a no-ball by umpire Orchard. Wth his second, Vaughan notches his 50 with a cracking four. With his third, he has Vaughan absolutely plumb lbw. How this isn't given, I will never know. The Indians go absolutely mad. His fourth ball is also close for lb. Then Vaughan jumps out of the frying pan with a single and puts Butcher in the fire and there is a third appeal of the over, this time for a catch. Umpire Orchard turns that one down too. Kumble is seething! At last, some excitement! 30th over: England 99-1 A wonderful shot from Butcher to thwack it away for four - a lovely cover drive, that. Agarkar doesn't like it. Butcher punches the next ball back down towards him and the bowler picks it up and pretends to throw at him. Butcher ducks just in case and the crowd jeer the Indian. 29th over: England 94-1 Kumble bowls. One run to Butcher, three to Vaughan. FEC is coming up to his 50 now. He's on 47. Butcher is on 12. Khan is being given a rest and Agarkar is coming on. 28th over: England 90-1 A no-ball from Khan, otherwise nothing of note in his over. Vaughan is playing him well. 27th over: England 89-1 There goes my computer again. Three runs off Kumble's over. Stuart Pearce is surprisingly articulate as a summariser. Maybe he could take over here when he's finished at Sky. 26th over: England 86-1 Khan to Vaughan. He drives past the bowler for three runs. That, plus a legbye brings four off the over. Richard Keys really does have the hairiest hands. They're hairier than my dad's which are very hairy indeed. 25th over: England 82-1 A couple for Vaughan and then Butcher scores his first boundary with an edge past gully. Look at Kumble's face. Oh. You can't. Meanwhile that's it at City. Kevin Keegan has recorded a victory against his old team. Robby Bobson couldn't look him in the face when they shook hands on the final whistle. 24th over: England 75-1 Butcher keeps the strike and scores two runs off Khan's first ball, picking one off his feet to deep fine leg. But that's it for the over. Pete Horn has emailed in to say why he thinks no-one is emailing in. \"I'm sure you haven't got so many emails today as not many people are at work.\" Ho-hum, I'm putting the football back on for the last couple of minutes of the game. 23rd over: England 73-1 A busy over for the batsmen. Vaughan punches one off the backfoot through the covers and runs three. That brings Butcher into play and he sneaks one past close fielder Rahul Dravid for another three to get off the mark. Alan Leece has sent me a sad face because he is still working. It looks like this: :-(( It's still 1-0 to City, by the way. I thought that had 3-4 written all over it. 22nd over: England 67-1 An edge from Key but it's safe and it flies past the third slip to the fence. Khan looks a bit narked. His next ball is a better one but Key is on to it and wallops it to the gully. But a smart dive to his right from Kumble stops a certain four and keeps Key on strike. Great fielding, and his glasses didn't even fall off. Another good delivery from Khan and this time Key plays across it and gets an edge. VVS Laxman takes the catch and Robert Key goes for 30. The batsman has time to turn round and see VVS pouch it. That's how to do it, Robert. Bye bye, Key. Hello, Mark Butcher. 21st over: England 63-0 Kumble bowls a maiden. My computer crashes. 20th over: England 63-0 Key mistimes a shot to mid-off but Ganguly allows it trickle harmlessly past him and they run two. \"Methinks that as long as Mr Key remembers how to hold his bat he will forget that he forgot how to catch. My prediction is that the batsmen will avoid all terrors and finish the day with something like 300 for the loss of only a couple. How's that for a bold statement?\" asks Alan Leece. Rubbish. You'll have noticed that I am having two make one email sound like two. Is there really no-one reading this? Will I have to stoop to putting up a picture of the other Jordan to attract more people? 1.40pm We're back. Hello to both my readers. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Alan Leece has written in. \"By the time they come back out after lunch I will be on a beach in the middle of the Atlantic under the hot sun.\" Well thanks for that. And then there was one. How are you doing Chris? I've been watching the Man City - Newcastle match over lunch on the telly we've got here. If you don't want to see the results, look away now... With half an hour still to go, it's 1-0 to City through an offside goal from Darren Huckerby. And Kieron Dyer has just missed a sitter. I'll keep you posted. 1pm: lunch Play begins again at 1.40pm so don't go away. Neither of you. 19th over: England 61-0 The last ball of the morning is flicked away through midwicket by Vaughan for four. A nice way to go to lunch. Both Key and Vaughan have played well, on 24 and 35 respectively. Chris Halliday has taken pity on me by emailing in again. Unfortunately, he doesn't have very much of interest to say, except that he is sitting in his office in Damascus, Syria. I'm off for something to eat. 18th over: England 57-0 Another maiden from Harbhajan. The batsmen are playing these spinners quite cagily, just waiting to pick off the loose ball. It's vital that they stay in and get England off to a good start. One more over before Key can get stuck into some pies. 17th over: England 57-0 Kumble gives the batsmen a run each. India would love a breakthrough just before lunch, but both Key and Vaughan look pretty comfortbale in the middle at the moment. Now there's a kiss of death, if ever there was one. Patel can't stop talking. I've no idea what he is saying, but he's very chirpy for such a youngster. Did you know that he lost the little finger of his left hand when he trapped in the door as a kid? Do any of you have any interesting cricketers' anecdotes? 16th over: England 55-0 Harbhajan Singh comes on for a bowl. The Turbanator starts with a maiden - and a nice one it was too. It gives young Patel up at the stumps plenty of work to do. There seems to be a fair bit of sledging going on too. You may have noticed that I don't have a sub-editor in today, so feel free to take George Parker's lead and email in with my currexshuns. 15th over: England 55-0 Kumble is giving Vaughan something to think about and there are plenty of fielders up close to put the pressure on. The Yorkeshireman is boxed in but then plays a dangerous shot, cutting Kumble away through the gap for four to bring up the 50 partnership. A couple more through deep sqaure leg and he moves on to 30. Key is on 23. 14th over: England 49-0 Bangar to Key: six balls, no runs, precious few details. 13th over: England 49-0 While I was fiddling round with Jordan, Anil Kumble came into the attack and Vaughan took two runs off him, clipping him away to deep square leg. 12th over: England 47-0 Just the one run off Bangar to Vaughan. Gary Perkins says: \"If we must read your commentary, can't you put up a picture of the lovely Jordan to make it easier on the eye?\" Gary, your wish is granted. 11th over: England 46-0 Another boundary to Key who looks to have put those dropped catches behind him. Khan has been a bit expensive this morning and concedes four more runs when key flicks him away to the square leg fence. Saurabh Bhargava, I am genuinely sorry that you didn't get to see Sachins's 200. I love to see him bat, and a few more runs would hardly have mattered. England haven't an earthly. The openers are matching each other stroke for stroke: 21 to Vaughan and 23 to Key. England trail by 582 runs. 582 runs - good grief. 10th over: England 42-0 Bangar bowls a loosener and Key plays it down to third man for two. But Bangar is getting the ball to swing. I'm lonely. Yesterday and Thursday I got so many emails I couldn't possibly read them all, but today, nothing. Issss annnyyonnne theeeeerrrrreeee? (That's how you write 'is anyone there?' with echo.) 9th over: England 39-0 A maiden from Khan. Imran Ahmed says: \"I'm getting that sinking feeling the game will be over by end of day 3 with Harbajan and Kumble bowling England out twice. I can see the Waugh twins laughing as they instant message with Ponting and company! Easy picking Matey!\" Right you are. Chelsea almost did it last night, didn't they? Bangar is coming on from the Football Stand end. 8th over: England 39-0 Agarkar overpitches one to Vaughan and the batsmen gives it the full face of the bat to the fence. Wallop! There are lots of people in fancy dress at Headingley today - as has become tradition on the Saturday of a Test match. There are some drinking nuns, two kinky nurses, some medics in surgical gowns, and a few blokes in WPC uniforms. Tremendous. I'm wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans, if you're interested. 7th over: England 34-0 England are only scoring in boundaries. A nice shot from Key off a short Kahn delivery. He cuts the ball safely away to the rope behind point. Key is going to be a very fat man when he stops playing sport. You can just tell. 6th over: England 30-0 A good-looking shot from Vaughan which flashes for four is followed by a half-hearted appeal for a catch - already the third of England's innings. But umpire De Silva is spot-on again. It hit his thigh pad. Darren Adams is asking how many pigeons are on the pitch. I can't see any at the moment. 5th over: England 26-0 A maiden from Khan. It has clouded over a little after a very bright first half hour, but there is no danger of any rain this morning. \"Please! More decorum in your assumptions about Key's nervousness. He's just having a rubbish match.\" You can say that again Chris Halliday. But so far he has started better with the bat than his fielding suggested he might. 4th over: England 26-0 A bad ball from Agarkar is given the treatment it deserves by Key. Four runs! A single and then Vaughan takes strike. He attempts the pull, but edges it and it loops up over the slips cordon and goes to the fence. A bit streaky, but England need some luck today. He follows that up with a more controlled boundary. Loose bowling from Agarkar - and there are 13 runs off his over to prove it. Key is on 13, Vaughan is on 12. 3rd over: England 13-0 Vaughan scores his first runs with a beautiful shot cracked through the covers. Khan calms it donw for the next five balls which are all dots. 2nd over: England 9-0 By 'eck, there's a big shout for lbw for Key. And the chubby-cheeked batsman thinks he is out. So does Agarkar who screams at umpire De Silva, but he gives Key the benefit of the doubt. Just a legbye comes off the over. But Key must be browning his whites. Michael Vaughan has yet to get off the mark. 1st over: England 8-0 Zaheer Khan will start to Robert \"couldn't catch a cold\" Key. To be fair to England's new opener, he settles his nerves immediately with two boundaries. The first is a gorgeous drive through cover point, the second is a drive to the fence at long off. Gosh! It's hot today and, after all this early action, I'm already exhausted. Innings break 180.1 overs: India declare on 628-8 Caddick removes Harbhajan who swings wildly and Hoggard makes up for a drop earlier this morning by taking the simple catch. With that, Ganguly calls them in. Engaldn need to make over 400 to avoid the follow-on. India scored 44-4 in 36 minutes this morning, but England dropped four catches too. 180th over: India 628-7 Three four in three balls from Harbhajan. Good grief! And then he should be out but Key drops another catch! Can you believe it? This man will be opening the batting for Engaldn in about 10 minutes, and his mind is obviously elsewhere. 18 runs off the over. 179th over: India 610-7 A few runs for both Patel and Harbhajan but, like a contestant on Going for Gold with Henry Kelly, I am playing catch-up, so that's your lot. 178th over: India 604-7 As Inida try to mount a big score, so the wickets tumble. They may as well declare now because this is just wasting valuable bowling time for them. Laxman goes this time. Hussain takes a wonderful catch off Tudor's bowling, diving full length in front of him to hold on to the ball and Laxman, to his credit, takes the England captain's word for it. India should declare! Harbhajan is in - and we know what he can do when he swings that bat. 177th over: India 603-6 Another England wicket, but this will not encourage them. There looks to be plenty in this pitch for the bowlers now and England know that India's spinners do not need any help. Agarkar tries to drive Caddick but misses it completely and the ball takes out middle stump. The 17-year-old Patel is next. He should have gone immeditaley but Robert Key pits down another dolly in the slips. He's not having an awfully good game in the field. Then two balls later, John Crawley take a wonderful diving catch but the ball spills out of his hands when he hits the ground - very unlucky. 176th over: India 602-5 Laxman is looking to slog everything and whips Tudor away for four with ease. Agarkar gets a single. We're having more technical difficulties here with this infuriating machine refusing to save. 175th over: India 597-5 Hurrah! England have a breakthrough and it's Tendulkar who has gone just seven runs short of that double hundred. A bowl from Caddick keeps low and raps the Littel Master just below the kneeroll. Umpire De Silva had no choice. Agarkar gets off the mark straight away, but surely India will declare now. The only reason they decided to bat on this morning was to let Tendulkar get his 200. 174th over: India 593-4 Tudor finishes off the over which he started last night. His first ball is a no-ball. Great. Then Tendulkar hits him for four and follows up with a square-drive for two. The extra ball is a legbye. An expensive way to start the day as India look to build the kind of total which means they will only have to bat onec in this match.
