So which companies piggy-backed on the outbreak to publicise their wares? The price comparison website Confused.com was one of the first out of the blocks with a press release stating that fears over the spread of the virus had sparked panic-buying of travel insurance. \"Travellers should not be prompted to buy cover by major events such as swine flu. Every holidaymaker should ensure they are adequately covered as soon as the holiday is booked,\" it said. Meanwhile, M&amp;S Money announced it would refund any Mexican pesos or US dollars bought from M&amp;S by people who had booked a trip to Mexico and decided not to go. Evil swine Online security experts say there has been a surge in email \"spam scams\" that play on people's fears about swine flu to try to peddle dodgy pills and medicines. McAfee Avert Labs adds that celebrity names, such as Madonna and Salma Hayek, were being used to attract users' attention. It urges anyone who receives such emails to delete them without opening them. Price of talent Wealthy celebs queued up this week to condemn the new 50% tax rate for high earners, warning that it could lead to an exodus of talent. Monday's Daily Mail quoted Sir Michael Caine (pictured) saying that \"if it goes to 51%, I will be back in America... We've got 3.5 million layabouts laying about on benefits, and I'm 76, getting up at 6am to go to work to keep them\". Meanwhile, Andrew Lloyd Webber attacked the \"Somali pirate-style raid\" on Britain's wealth creators. Few people would shed a tear if the likes of Lloyd Webber were to quit Britain, but don't hold your breath. The Reporter recalls that a fair few right-leaning celebrities threatened to emigrate if Labour won the 1997 election, but failed to carry out their threat \u2026 Insurance stooge Aging rocker Iggy Pop's TV advert for car insurance broke the rules because the company he promotes excluded people working in entertainment, according to a ruling this week. In the ad, Iggy leaps around declaring: \"I got it Swiftcovered. I got insurance on my insurance!\" Swiftcover had the nerve to claim that the Stooges frontman didn't state in the ad that he had a policy with them (er, have you guys watched your own ad?), and added that it made no reference to his occupation, but the advertising watchdog rejected that. However, the good news for all rockers out there is that the company is now making its insurance available to musicians for the first time. Post mortem A widow got 317 letters from Barclaycard in one day, it was reported this week \u2013 and the only one correctly addressed was to her dead husband. Sandra Grant, 55, of Erith in Kent, spent hours opening her post, which contained letters for other customers, said the London Lite newspaper. The card company has apologised. Holiday banker \"Don't drift off to death this bank holiday...\" was the cheery headline on an AA press release. No, not swine flu again \u2013 just a warning about falling asleep at the wheel, which the AA says is likely to claim the lives of three motorists this bank holiday weekend. The company has negotiated 20% off food and drink at Moto service stations for its members to encourage them to stop for a coffee. Quality castoffs If you're going to a fancy dress party as a Leeds Building Society cashier but are struggling to find an outfit, you could be in luck. The society has replaced its corporate uniform and has donated several boxes of the old outfits to Barnardo's. The children's charity says it is grateful to the Leeds for its donation, as the fabrics are very high quality. \"The collection of all the old uniforms from the Leeds head office was quite an occasion, with a lot of manpower involved!\" it adds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
