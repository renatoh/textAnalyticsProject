But here are some who have made the effort. Big Lebowski star Jeff Bridges has a brilliant hand-drawn site (jeffbridges.com) full of doodles, photos and links. Elsewhere, we can learn that Billy Bob Thornton's pet mynah bird is called Alice at billybobthornton.net, hear what Leonardo DiCaprio thinks about global warming at leonardodicaprio.com, get nutritional advice from sylvesterstallone.com and watch Adam Sandler (adamsandler.com) feed his dogs pasta. Fine work. Nothing, though, compares to the ornate splendour that serves as Melanie Griffith's online presence (melaniegriffith.com) - enter the Story Of Avalon Room to see the letter Melanie has written to her \"inner self\" or join her in some quick meditation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
