But over on YouTube, a slew of pretenders to the throne are making a virtue of more modest budgets, like canny food-truck chefs giving Michelin-starred restaurants a run for their money. They can\u2019t boast the exotic locations or multicamera setups of Netflix\u2019s shows, but thanks to their wit, charisma and concepts, that doesn\u2019t really matter. Many are the work of new media upstarts such as Vice Media\u2019s Munchies, First We Feast and Thrillist, whose main show, Really Dough, investigates outlandish pizza variations across New York\u2019s five boroughs, including crusts made out of cauliflower, pancake-bases smothered with kimchi and gold-topped pizzas priced at $2,000. The concept is strong, but the show\u2019s true attraction is the interplay between hosts Scott Wiener \u2013 a pizza obsessive famous for his day job hosting tours of the city\u2019s pizzerias and his record-breaking collection of pizza boxes (1,300 and counting) \u2013 and Mark Iacono, a hard-nosed Brooklyn pizza chef whose renowned joint, Lucali, boasts Beyonc\u00e9 and Gwyneth Paltrow as fans. Wiener says his buddy-movie chemistry with Iacono is unforced. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty real,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI\u2019m this goofy guy, and he\u2019s the cool dude getting frustrated at me making him eat all these weird pizzas.\u201d He hopes to explore more exotic pizza-esque dishes such as lahmacun when the third season of Really Dough begins production later this year \u2013 if, that is, the crotchety Iacono unbans him from Lucali\u2019s premises. Gourmet Makes, meanwhile, is the work of Bon Appetit, a 63-year-old food magazine owned by the defiantly old media Cond\u00e9 Nast. Never straying beyond the confines of the title\u2019s test kitchen, the show follows the indefatigable host Claire Saffitz as she attempts to reproduce (and improve) classic snack foods, such as Skittles and Oreos, from scratch. A recipe editor for the magazine, who had studied in a patisserie in Paris, Saffitz had no grand ambitions to be a star before becoming the presenter of Gourmet Makes\u2019 pilot episode, simply by being in the test kitchen on the day of filming. But after Saffitz spent four days applying her MacGyver-esque skills reverse-engineering the impenetrable magic behind a Twinkie, it was clear the show had found the perfect host. A fan of classic TV chefs such as Julia Child and Martha Stewart, Saffitz initially struggled to understand the appeal of Gourmet Makes. \u201cI was, like: \u2018Who\u2019s going to make Skittles at home?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut feedback from viewers made me understand what the series was really about: me persevering, being meticulous and just trying to make this thing.\u201d Solving such mysteries as how to make gelatinised sugar ooze from a candy-crisp shell or replicate the gratifying snap of a KitKat, Gourmet Makes has become an unexpected smash: the Skittles episode had more than 10m views. Alongside shows such as It\u2019s Alive \u2013 following the test kitchen\u2019s amiable galoot Brad Leone as he discovers how sausages, knives and mustard are made \u2013 the series has revitalised Bon Appetit\u2019s brand. \u201cWe get DMs on Instagram from people who love the videos, but didn\u2019t realise we are a magazine, and are now subscribers,\u201d laughs Saffitz. By contrast to these other shows, Binging With Babish is the work of a defiantly independent self-starter, creator/presenter/editor Andrew Rea. His series has a wonderfully simple concept: attempting famous dishes from TV and the movies, from the sublime (the \u201cprison sauce\u201d from Goodfellas) to the ridiculous (Rachel\u2019s disastrous trifle/shepherd\u2019s pie hybrid from Friends). The show began as therapy for Rea, who was \u201cdeeply depressed and needing to exercise my remaining creative muscles\u201d when he filmed his first video early in 2016, recreating the legendary burger cook-off between Ron Swanson and Chris Traeger from Parks &amp; Recreation. While his ambitions didn\u2019t stretch beyond making the front page of the r/Cooking subreddit, Rea\u2019s impressive home-chef skills and droll narration sent the show viral. An attempt at Ross Geller\u2019s \u201cmoistmaker\u201d Thanksgiving sandwich netted several hundred thousand views, and mainstream attention. Newly divorced, he ploughed every hour he wasn\u2019t working as a visual effects artist into cranking out weekly episodes. Twenty months after filming the first episode, he quit his day job, monetising the show via YouTube ads and Patreon sponsorship from fans. The success of these shows has given the presenters unexpected online fame, with Saffitz in particular inspiring plenty of internet fan art. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange, though wonderful, experience,\u201d says Saffitz, who admits she is \u201can introvert and a little shy\u201d. Nevertheless, Gourmet Makes\u2019 success helped secure Saffitz a baking book with Random House\u2019s Carson Potter imprint. Wiener, meanwhile, wears his stardom a little easier, laughing that he \u201cwas always being recognised in pizzerias anyway\u201d. TV networks have offered Rea his own shows, but he prefers his DIY approach, setting up his own company, Binge Entertainment, to navigate what he describes as a \u201ccontent gold rush\u201d, including sister shows Basics With Babish, where he teaches cookery techniques, and Being With Babish, where he spends time with fans. But beyond commercial success, the show itself remains Rea\u2019s reward. \u201cIt has pushed me out of my comfort zone, and so my comfort zone just keeps on expanding. It\u2019s more than a dream job because I never could have dreamed that this would be my job.\u201d Rea\u2019s forearm bears a tattoo of a carving fork, a sign of his absolute commitment to the show. In the show\u2019s early days, he bought the utensil for $80 on his credit card, despite being broke, so he could present his pasta Aglio E Olio exactly as Jon Favreau had in Chef. When Favreau later guested on Binging to make Chef\u2019s infamous Chocolate Lava Cakes, he presented Rea with the carving fork from the movie. \u201cIt was far and away the best moment of my life,\u201d Rea grins. Really Dough season three is available on YouTube from Monday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
