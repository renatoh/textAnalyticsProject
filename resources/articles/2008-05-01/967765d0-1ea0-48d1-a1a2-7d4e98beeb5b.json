One of the more controversial issues that the government has been grappling with is whether age-discrimination laws should be extended. As things stand, UK age-discrimination legislation only covers the workplace. In contrast, laws that combat discrimination on racial grounds or on grounds of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief are much broader, extending protection to individuals in their dealings with suppliers of goods and services. Extending the reach of the current age laws would protect people from age discrimination by providers of goods or services, including public sector services such as NHS provision. Private sector services could also be affected. For example, insurers could be prevented from charging older people higher premiums without accurate data showing that the premium fairly reflects an increased risk. The debate about the proper reach of anti-discrimination rules is echoed across Europe. Only last week, in response to a report from MEP Liz Lynne, the European parliament called on the European commission to propose a new Europe-wide directive to combat age and other forms of discrimination by providers of goods and services. Indeed, in November 2007, when it published its plan for 2008, the commission did seem to be in favour of a comprehensive directive. However, since then there have been suggestions that the commission may be back-peddling. And that ultimately the idea of a combined directive covering the various discrimination strands will be abandoned in favour of a single directive covering just disability discrimination. In some respects, a new, comprehensive directive could help British businesses. Existing UK laws on disability, sexual orientation and religion/belief discrimination go beyond the strict requirements of EU law. A new directive would level the EU playing-field by ensuring competing businesses operate to the same minimum regulatory standards. But extending protection from age discrimination promises to be controversial. 'Relatively complex' It is widely accepted that age differentiation can sometimes be a good thing. For example, both older and younger age groups often enjoy cheaper theatre tickets, cheaper haircuts and subsidised public transport. In its consultation paper last year on proposals for a single equality bill the government acknowledged that any law in this area would have to tread a fine line between preventing \"harmful age discrimination and enabling beneficial and justifiable age differentiation to continue\". \"Discrimination\" and \"differentiation\" are, however, just opposite sides of the same coin. That being the case, the government has conceded that any new law would be \"relatively complex\". Given that discrimination laws, no matter how carefully drafted, are inevitably complicated, the promise of something relatively complex does not bode well. The problem is that complexity means uncertainty and this can lead to unintended consequences. If organisations can't be sure what is and what is not allowed, there is a real risk that they will stop providing beneficial services or terms rather than face the risk of a legal challenge with all the attendant cost, bother and publicity. The difficulties created by such uncertainty are amply illustrated by the age-discrimination laws that were introduced in October 2006. The charity Age Concern has brought a high court challenge arguing that certain aspects of that legislation contravene EU law. It may well be 2010 or later before the law is clarified by the UK courts and the European court of justice. In the meantime employers have to make decisions without any confidence as to the legal position. Employers who wish to obey the law can't because they don't know what the law is. There is also an issue of timing. The age-discrimination laws for employers were introduced less than two years ago and there is not yet consensus on crucial questions such as whether age discrimination should be viewed in the same way as other forms of discrimination. Last year in a case known as Lindorfer, two advocate generals in the ECJ suggested that the prohibition of age discrimination should, because of its nature and history, be interpreted and applied less rigorously than protection against sex discrimination. So far, that does not represent the official position of the ECJ, which has not formally addressed the point. Eventually, fundamental issues such as this will no doubt be resolved. But ideally that needs to happen before deciding whether age laws should be extended. \u00b7 Audrey Williams is head of discrimination law at Eversheds LLP"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
