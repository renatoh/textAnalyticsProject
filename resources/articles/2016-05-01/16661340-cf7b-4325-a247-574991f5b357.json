The former Napoli and Internazionale manager held talks with the Watford owner, Gino Pozzo, this week and agreed terms on a deal on Friday night. The 54-year-old has not managed since leaving Inter in 2014 but has spent parts of the past two years in England, learning English. Mazzarri quickly emerged as the favourite to replace Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores with Pozzo having been an admirer for a long time. The Watford owner, who also owns Udinese, had been keen for Mazzarri to take over at the Italian club but the timing was never right. Now, however, Pozzo has got his man. Mazzarri has a long and distinguished coaching career behind him already with four years at Napoli \u2013 where Valon Behrami and Miguel Britos, now at Watford, played for him \u2013 as well as spells at Pistoiese, Livorno, Reggina and Sampdoria. He prefers to play in a 3-5-2 system. Watford\u2019s chief executive, Scott Duxbury, told the club\u2019s website: \u201cWalter has been the target of a number of approaches for his services, so we\u2019re delighted to secure him as head coach here at Watford. We\u2019re thoroughly looking forward to working with such a highly-regarded coach, with the progress and development of the club always remaining the highest priority.\u201d Watford finished 13th in the Premier League this season, having been promoted under Slavisa Jokanovic in 2015, and reached the FA Cup semi-finals. However, their form was disappointing in the new year and Watford announced this month that Flores would leave at the end of the season. After their final game of the season, a 2-2 draw with Sunderland, Flores said: \u201cWatford is now established in the Premier League, so next year is coming more players, more quality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
