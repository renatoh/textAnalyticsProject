Olivier Giroud scored a hat-trick as Arsenal won 3-0 to beat the Greek champions on the head-to-head tie-break \u2013 Olympiakos had won 3-2 at the Emirates in September \u2013 and it was a night when Wenger described every last detail as being \u201cperfect\u201d. The draw for the first knockout round takes place on Monday and Arsenal will face one of Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Barcelona, Wolfsburg or Zenit St Petersburg. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who we get next round, I\u2019ve not even looked at that,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe were so much out of it that I put all my focus on staying in. The kind of performance we produced in a very heated atmosphere was perfect \u2013 on the mental front and the tactical side as well. We needed great character and that kind of performance will certainly make the team stronger. \u201cWe were in escape mode before the game and we needed something special. I told you that it would be the greatest escape. When you do that, it creates a positive memory for the rest of the season. Maybe it is a lucky year for us in the Champions League. You never know.\u201d Wenger has enjoyed many great European nights during his long tenure at Arsenal but he put this one up there with the best. \u201cWhen we look at who we lost [to injuries] in the last three weeks \u2013 Coquelin, Cazorla and S\u00e1nchez \u2013 and we came here with all the other players who were already out, not many people gave us a chance,\u201d Wenger added. \u201cBut we are a real team. We are very close in the dressing room and you could see this tonight. We needed the perfect performance and it was one of the best we have given in Europe.\u201d Giroud completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot and Wenger said that the striker had been the team\u2019s designated taker, ahead of Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey. \u201cWe respected the order,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd he took it well. He has practised in training and he was quite good. But it\u2019s easier to score when you already have two. \u201cIt was the perfect performance from Olivier. He scored a header, one from a great pass from Joel Campbell and the penalty. He found himself in uncomfortable positions but he showed skills and character. He had to fight like mad. I have always defended Olivier\u2019s character. He has something special on the character front and he showed that again tonight.\u201d Giroud said: \u201cIt is fantastic for me and the team, and we are really pleased to go through. We missed the chance a few years ago, and last year against Monaco, so it is nice to go through. We are so pleased for the fans and I feel really good. \u201cThe Champions League is one level up and we needed to be focused as a unit and together. We defended well, too. We are really pleased to have done this and now we will focus back on the Premier League and try to carry on our good momentum from this game. \u201cWe want to go as far as we can in the Champions League and my personal target is to reach at least the quarter-final. I think that\u2019s the same for the team. It\u2019s the fourth year I have been at Arsenal and I have never played in a quarter-final.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
