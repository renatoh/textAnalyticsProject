The Fenway Sports Group chairman was instrumental in the decision to sack Rodgers last Sunday and replace him with the former Borussia Dortmund coach within four days. While the switch has been rapturously received by Liverpool supporters, it represents a departure from FSG\u2019s plan for a young coach to develop a young squad over time. Werner, however, claims Rodgers suffered on account of his own signings as manager and that he expects the current squad to respond to Klopp\u2019s quality. \u201cWhen we appointed Brendan we thought he was going to be the right manager for Liverpool,\u201d the chairman said. \u201cObviously we now feel that we have got the world-class manager and beyond that there is not much more I would like to say. \u201cWe gave Brendan, as you know, an opportunity to see if we could improve this season. There was some very good football last season and some not so good football. There were some challenges that dealt with injuries, we brought in some new players that Brendan recommended that we thought would take us forward. We are where we are. I don\u2019t want to say too much. Brendan is an outstanding manager and we decided to move in a different direction and I am very optimistic.\u201d Werner, right, added: \u201cObviously we have a challenge this season and J\u00fcrgen said it right. None of the supporters are satisfied with our position right now and we believe that J\u00fcrgen is the right manager to take us forward. As you all know we came into this situation with great ambition and I would rather focus on the future.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s chairman refused to be drawn on when contact was first made with the German coach but admitted: \u201cWe have thought about him for a long time and everyone who knows football knows he is an outstanding manager. Obviously he motivates players. We all expect the players are going to respond to him.\u201d Werner conceded that FSG has had \u201cmore managers than we hoped\u201d but believes Klopp, the group\u2019s third appointment as manager and fourth in total, \u201cwill be here for a very long time\u201d. Next week marks the fifth anniversary of FSG\u2019s takeover of Liverpool and the chairman accepted its initial aims for the club are yet to be realised. He added: \u201cWe have obviously had some great moments in these five years and came very close to winning the league two years ago. Nobody is satisfied today with our position and as owners we are not going to put undue pressure on J\u00fcrgen. He knows that there are great expectations and when we look at the time line I think we have made some improvements. We all know the challenge that we saw when we came into the club five years ago and I think we are proud when we walked into the stadium today and we showed J\u00fcrgen the new main stand that is being constructed. Until we win more trophies we won\u2019t be satisfied.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
