A report by the Education Policy Institute suggests schools have whittled down the number of pupils taking the likes of dance and fine art at key stage four, after reforms pushed pupils towards more traditional academic subjects such as geography and English. The EPI report published on Thursday blamed the Department for Education (DfE) over its new Progress 8 performance measure \u2013 based on results from predominantly academic subjects at GCSE \u2013 and its promotion of the narrow English Baccalaureate (EBacc) suite of subjects as partly responsible for the shift. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was clear that the Ebacc and Progress 8 performance measures were squeezing arts subjects out of schools. \u201cThe influence of the EBacc works against a broad and balanced curriculum and it is imperative that it be withdrawn,\u201d said Courtney. \u201cSubjects such as art, music and technology, that are not just crucial for our economic prosperity but also enrich lives, are disappearing from our schools.\u201d According to the EPI\u2019s estimates, about 19,000 fewer pupils took arts subjects at key stage four last year compared with in 2014. The EPI study differed from previous research in that it also counted non-GCSE arts qualifications, which had been popular until the DfE excluded many of them from its performance tables. \u201cThis recent drop in arts entries is driven by several factors, including changes to the way school performance is measured such as EBacc or Progress 8, financial pressures on schools, and of course local decisions taken by school leaders,\u201d said Becky Johnes, senior researcher at EPI. Progress 8 counts specified results achieved in subjects including English, sciences, maths, modern foreign languages and history or geography, along with a maximum of three other approved academic or vocational qualifications. Ministers have said the three open subjects offers room for pupils to study arts, but teachers and school leaders argue the measure has been reinforced by the Ebacc, a school performance measure based solely on passes in English, maths, history or geography, sciences and languages. The EPI study found that pupils who were not entered for the EBacc were more likely to study at least one art subject. However, the EPI found that high-performing schools that achieved good results in arts subjects were more likely to continue offering them to pupils. The DfE said that there was \u201cbroad stability\u201d between pupils taking GCSEs in EBacc subjects and the arts. \u201cThe EPI report presents different findings because it takes different subject groupings and qualifications into account in its calculations,\u201d a DfE spokesperson said. Henry Vann, a co-ordinator of the Bacc for the Future campaign that opposed the EBac, said the EPI\u2019s report should be read carefully by policy-makers. \u201cIt is highly likely that 2017\u2019s GCSE results will show a continuation in this worrying trend,\u201d Vann said. The Ebacc was also blamed in part for the failure of state schools to teach the required amount of religious education. The Commission on Religious Education \u2013 made up of academics and educationalists \u2013 called for \u201cstrategic, urgent intervention\u201d to halt the decline in religious education (RE) in schools, in a report also published on Thursday. \u201cAll students need a thorough understanding of religious and non-religious worldviews, regardless of their own personal views, as a vital preparation for life and employment in modern Britain,\u201d said the Very Rev John Hall, the Dean of Westminster who chaired the commission. \u201cThe evidence is that too many state schools are failing to meet their legal obligations to provide religious education for all students. This is unfair. \u201cSo we are recommending a national entitlement for RE and that all schools should be required to give an account of how they make the provision.\u201d A survey \u2013 by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales and the National Association of Teachers of RE \u2013 found a quarter of schools failed to offer RE to students at key stage four. The exclusion of religious studies from the Ebacc was one of the reasons for the fall, along with the DfE\u2019s exclusion of previously popular short-course GCSEs from performance tables."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
