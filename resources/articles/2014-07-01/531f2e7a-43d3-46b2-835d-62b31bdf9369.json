Fox Footy and tabloid pundits lined up to complain that Malthouse is an unacceptable person to have around Australian football, their principal complaint being that he hurts their tiny tender feelings by being cranky. They also took the chance to impartially and unemotionally tender their opinion that his coaching abilities have evaporated, in line with the less patient end of the Blues-supporting spectrum. Former player Dermott Brereton gave a serve right back at his colleagues, stressing his admiration for Malthouse and the nature of the media\u2019s position. If Malthouse is brusque, Brereton said, \u201cI accept that he is the coach of the team that I was inquiring about, I dust myself off and ask the next question with good grace\u2026 We the media are the beggars in this situation.\u201d In any case, collations of \"media spats\" consist of Mick responding to stupid questions as though they were stupid questions. There\u2019s generally dry humour in his replies, and a sharpness that makes it clear how the questioner can lift their game. Fair enough: if you\u2019re piping up with \u201cDid your team come to play today?\u201d then don\u2019t expect to be treated like Carl Bernstein. But pressure is pressure, and Carlton\u2019s big win over North Melbourne on Friday night will have provided Malthouse more relief than Brereton\u2019s vote of support. The Blues have lost well in the past few weeks, competing hard against top-eight sides Geelong, Hawthorn and Collingwood. Now they\u2019ve finally put together a win over a higher-ranked opponent, and comprehensively. There\u2019s a long road ahead, but for this week at least Carlton fans might be feeling a few moments of togetherness. Lenny should retire every week It was always going to be emotional when St Kilda champion Lenny Hayes called it a day. More than any player but Nick Riewoldt, he represents the Saints\u2019 modern era, rising from turn-of-the-millennium ashes to become a powerhouse, then subsiding once more. He also represents St Kilda\u2019s hard luck story, his last-minute kick in the 2010 grand final bouncing the wrong side of the goal post to draw the game rather than win it. His retirement announcement last week would have inspired his team-mates, but no one expected St Kilda\u2019s sheer joyful attack on the ball on Saturday afternoon. A team ironed onto the bottom of the ladder were playing a ruthless Fremantle outfit playing for top spot \u2013 yet St Kilda smashed them. And I mean smashed them, stripping off 10 percentage points in the process. Even with top defender Sean Dempster subbed off with concussion in the first three minutes, Riewoldt and Rhys Stanley reeled in marks and kicked goals at will. The Saints led by 20 at quarter time, 40 at half time, and, when you thought Freo might start to pull them back, slammed on six goals to two in the third \u2013 403 disposals to 282 told the story. So, how do the Saints find that every week? Paradoxical Cats remain impossible to read You are free to see Saturday night\u2019s win as a professional result: a banana-skin avoided, an improving team held off, a poor interstate record this year defied. But the record covers up the way Geelong limped home against Greater Western Sydney to continue their paradox of a season. A paradox because in Victoria the Cats have been unbeaten, but rarely looked unbeatable. Because Geelong now sit second on the ladder, with first playing third next weekend. Because they\u2019ve won and won, yet last looked really convincing in round five. There have been exhilarating performances \u2013 Steven Motlop\u2019s final quarter against Essendon will live long in the memory. But the Cats have repeatedly played partial games of football against lesser opponents and nearly paid the price. Their next few involve an angry North Melbourne, a desperate Fremantle and a professional Hawthorn. Destiny is in their control \u2013 win those games and finish top two. Of course I\u2019d love the magic blue-and-white-hooped story to continue, champion teams are the most enduring part of football. But the idea of using this easy run of games to build form looks increasingly shaky. From here they need four quarters of their best, and to prove they still know where to find it. Paul Roos works miracles, even if Port prayers were heard They may have lost, but Melbourne\u2019s performance was one of their best in years. Taking on Port Adelaide on their home ground has been a tough ask, but the Demons pushed Port all the way, taking the lead in the third quarter and in the last, and losing by three points only when Port snared the final goal. There\u2019s now a belief about this Melbourne side. We saw it when they refused to let Essendon win in round 13, we saw it when they pushed Port hard in round 11, and we saw it when they went to Adelaide Oval to beat the Crows. Really the Demons should have won: they wasted several shots in the last quarter and local pressure also affected the umpires, with a series of calls and non-calls all going against the visitors. But Roos will be very satisfied. All day his players chased and harassed Port Adelaide, tackling, winning holding-the-ball decisions, dragging players off their kicks or hemming Port in. The skilful Port Adelaide gameplan struggled under the pressure. These basics are the things Melbourne are working hardest to instil. Rather than looking at more unproven coaches, they should be doing every possible thing to convince Roos to stay on. Big payload confirms arrival of stealth Bomber Jake Carlisle is only 22, but it seems like he\u2019s been a nearly-man for a long time. A patchy couple of years for Essendon have been a patchy couple for Carlisle, the key-position player being swung between attack and defence, and failing to have the impact up forward that supporters wanted. It\u2019s pretty tough to expect that sort of player just to slot in, but with that early experience under his belt, Carlisle has had a couple of weeks to show what he\u2019s capable of. The round before last he pulled in an astonishing 19 marks and kicked four goals as the Bombers routed Collingwood. This weekend, against the Western Bulldogs, he kicked a career-best eight, with 12 marks including 10 inside 50. Good form doesn\u2019t guarantee that it\u2019ll continue, but as with St Kilda, Carlton and Melbourne, he now has a benchmark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
