The United manager sat beside his brother Martin writing copious notes on a performance from Rangers that was impressive in the beginning but deteriorated thereafter. He will undoubtedly have observed the deficiencies of the Craig Moore and Henning Berg central-defensive partnership, the fact that Emerson is static in midfield and the lack of a killer instinct from Michael Mols. He will also have noticed the dangers of Peter Lovenkrands's pace, the invention of Mikel Arteta and the mobility of Shota Arveladze. Yet overall he saw Rangers stretched to the limit by a youthful and exuberant Motherwell team who thoroughly deserved their point. At the outset Rangers looked the part. With Zura Khizanishvili pushed into midfield to allow Moore back to partner Berg the Scottish champions began at a furious pace and moved the ball about purposefully and precisely. The reward came after 14 minutes, when Lovenkrands and Mols allowed Khizanishvili to release Arveladze and the Georgian's delightful chip beat Gordon Marshall to give the visitors a deserved early lead. Rather than settle Rangers, however, the goal appeared to put them inexplicably on edge and their opening fluency was replaced by a carelessness that handed Motherwell an equaliser 11 minutes later. Moore's slack pass let Keith Lasley cross into the box and, although Berg half-cleared, the ball fell kindly for Stephen Pearson to score in style. The Well refused to let Rangers relax and went in deservedly level despite Mols having an effort cleared off the line by Stephen Craigan and missing with a free header and Arteta forcing Marshall into a fine save. The second-half pattern was similar to the first. Rangers had early chances through Lovenkrands, Arteta and Mols, who had a further strike cleared off the line, before Craigan went close for Motherwell and Lasley twice even closer. \"It could have finished 6-6,\" said the Motherwell manager Terry Butcher. \"It was a fantastic, open game with both teams committed to going for a victory. As for Rangers on Wednesday night it will be a bit of a role reversal from here because unusually they will not be favourites.\" Alex McLeish acknowledged that fact. \"The midweek match will be different but we have a bit of work to do before it and we will have to be a whole lot better,\" he said. \"I'm sure Alex Ferguson will be thinking if we play this way they'll win - and comfortably - but there's a lot more in us and we will raise our game.\" Mols sounded the alarm while bemoaning his missed chances. \"We will need to do much better or we'll get an even worse result,\" the Dutch international said. \"The performance was not so good and I missed chances but now we want to get rid of this feeling in midweek.\" Man of the match: Keith Lasley (Motherwell) His tireless performance for Motherwell was deserving of a goal, although he squandered his best chance after being set up by Steven Craig. Best moment: When his superbly struck volley was brilliantly kept out by the Rangers goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
