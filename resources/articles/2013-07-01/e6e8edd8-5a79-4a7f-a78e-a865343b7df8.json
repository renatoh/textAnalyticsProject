A crowd that had been basking in the sun all day began shivering in shorts and summer dresses. Meanwhile Jerzy Janowicz was proving there was much more to his game than shock and awe \u2013 displaying soft hands to match his hard serve. But, as against Fernando Verdasco in the quarter-final, Murray fought his way back into the match through sheer force of will. As he did so, he rallied a crowd that was hitherto becalmed and felt the momentum of the match shift. And the Scot, buoyed in turn, seemed to feel belief surge through him. That impression grew until the Pole's endless complaints about the fading light appeared to result in the roof being closed, robbing a furious Murray of his momentum and bringing to mind bad memories of last year's final. But when they came back out under the Friday night lights with Murray 2-1 up, it was as though the Scot and his public had jointly resolved not to let that happen. Roared on by a now fully engaged crowd Murray grew in stature and Janowicz, playing in only his third grass-court tournament at this level, wilted. The opening exchanges had a very different mood. Those watching appeared sated by the banquet laid on by Novak Djokovic and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and the rat-a-tat tennis of Murray and his big serving opponent could not match the drama of what went before. The only sounds beyond the regulation muttering and munching were gasps as Janowicz's 140mph howitzers started raining down, putting those watching in the Royal Box at risk more than once as they thundered up off the grass. Line judges, ball girls, photographers, the Duchess of Gloucester \u2013 no one was safe. Janowicz's enthusiastic backers in his box were intent on matching the volume of Murray's support on their own. There were many more panama hats than union flags in evidence and initially little of the delirium that characterised Wednesday's storming comeback. Sometimes the Centre Court set seem unsure whether this is a drama they should be merely watching or participating in but by the time Murray took a rollercoaster third set they were sure they wanted a piece of the action. It might not always be evident in the rarefied Centre Court air but something has shifted in the SW19 psyche this year. For many years it had become a trope as tiresome as the queue, the price of strawberries and that irritating bloke who insists on shouting \"Come on Tim\" during Murray's matches. But the question of whether the crowd, in all their eccentric peculiarity, have taken Murray \"to their hearts\" is heard less and less around the lush lawns of the All England Club. And the fact the question is no longer asked is probably the best evidence that it has already been definitively answered. A combination of last year's stirring run to the final and those tears in defeat by Roger Federer, the subsequent riposte on the same court against the same opponent to take Olympic gold, his long awaited first grand slam title and even that BBC eve of tournament documentary have somehow belatedly catalysed a real bond. Where he once felt like an interloper, more at home with the informality of the US Open and engaged in an awkward dance with middle England, now he bestrides Centre Court as if he owns it. Time after time when he was in trouble he dug himself out when he might once have cracked. For Murray and his public, familiarity has bred contentment. As when Murray was stuttering and off-key in his quarter-final, he played the crowd like an orchestra \u2013 urging them to help him over the line. The tittering tics of the fans can sometimes irritate but again they played their part here. On breakfast TV on Friday morning a group of fresh-faced young Murray fans with Home Counties accents but Saltires in their hats were interviewed about their hopes to secure a patch on Henman Hill to watch the semi-final. Asked how they planned to voice their support, they paused for a moment before letting out a guttural \"C'mon Andy\". Polite hesitation followed by full-throated backing was the order of the day on court later too. Best of all, Murray has done it on his own terms. He may now allow the public to see a little bit more of the man behind the mask but he has refused to be turned into a celebrity. Even as he has made clear, in deed if not word, that he does not crave the love of the Wimbledon crowd, they have slowly but surely accepted him into their bubble. Eight years after he first appeared here, their slow-burning admiration has ignited into adoration. Perhaps one other happy spin-off of last year's glorious, golden summer is that the British sporting public \u2013 or this subsection of it at least \u2013 has finally learned to love a winner. But there is little time to dwell on that. As he took the acclaim of the crowd and purposefully strode off court at the end of the match with the air of a man who had not yet finished the job, the attention of both Murray and the crowd had already turned to Sunday, when they will reconvene to do it all again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
