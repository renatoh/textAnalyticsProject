Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husband\u2019s administration, she argued that if the past eight years were a guide, Trump was neither prepared nor qualified for the presidency. \u201cA candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Obama told a crowd of mostly students and young people. \u201cBecause the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is.\u201d The first lady also made reference to her well-received speech at the Democratic national convention in July, saying of Republican campaign tactics, \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d. Obama recalled the 2008 campaign that propelled her husband to the White House. \u201cThen there were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and up through this very day whether my husband was even born in this country,\u201d she said, again alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism, a conspiracy theory that claims President Obama was born in Kenya and is thus not qualified to be president, using the issue to help propel his political ambitions. On Friday morning, facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters, Trump said for the first time that Barack Obama was in fact born on US soil. Michelle Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton, especially among young voters. New polling shows that millennials, disappointed by their options for president, have increasingly turned toward third-party candidates. The first lady\u2019s appearance on a college campus in Virginia, a battleground state, was part of a broad push by the Clinton campaign to win back some millennial voters who have strayed. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the challenger whose strong primary challenge to Clinton was powered by young people and students, will campaign for the Democratic nominee. \u201cElections aren\u2019t just about who votes but who doesn\u2019t vote,\u201d Obama said on Friday, imploring young people in the crowd to support Clinton and to fight the urge to \u201chide under the bed\u201d, to avoid becoming \u201ctired or turned off\u201d by the election. She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired by Sanders. \u201cI hear folks saying they don\u2019t feel inspired in this election,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWell let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I\u2019ve had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job, and here is what I absolutely know for sure. \u201cListen to this: right now we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president.\u201d Above all, the event was a testament to Obama\u2019s enduring popularity. \u201cIt is so hard to believe that it is less than two months until election and that my family is almost at the end of term,\u201d she said. The crowd broke into a raucous round of chanting, demanding \u201cfour more years\u201d. \u201cNo,\u201d Obama said, waving her hand. The chant continued. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cI promise you,\u201d she said, \u201cBarack and I will continue to work for you for the rest of our lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
