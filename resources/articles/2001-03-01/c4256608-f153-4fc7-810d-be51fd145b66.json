Poor form of late, culminating in the haphazard 3-3 home draw against Gillingham nine days ago, provoked many to write off their chances of winning the race for the second automatic promotion place. But their detractors were answered in style on Saturday with an impressive win against Nottingham Forest, whose play-off hopes waned. Second-half goals from Dean Holdsworth and Gareth Farrelly brought the visitors their first win in seven games and their first success at the City Ground for 25 years. And with Blackburn and Birmingham, their main rivals for that all-important runners-up spot behind Fulham, both dropping points at the weekend, Bolton breathed new life into their promotion challenge. Holdsworth, who claimed his 200th career goal when stabbing in a Ricardo Gardner centre after a brilliant run by the Jamaica international, said that the criticism in recent weeks had been a major motivating force. \"We came out today like a wounded animal. We've been wounded by the criticism and have come back fighting for our lives because we badly want to be in the Premier League,\" he said. The former Wimbledon striker had a defiant message for rival clubs: \"They don't know what beasts we are. We're going to be all right. There's a good spirit within the team and we'll always bounce back. We've got the make-up and the quality to go up.\" As for Forest, Farrelly's superb injury-time chip over Dave Beasant, which sealed the points for Bolton, condemned David Platt's side to their second successive defeat and severely dented their play-off ambitions. Platt questioned the mental attitude of the Forest players after a poor display and lamented: \"Maybe one or two players are too sure of their place in the team, which can't be good. It's difficult because we have injuries and suspensions but we can't bring anyone in. We need to get people out.\" With news that the new England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is sounding out Platt as the next England Under-21 manager, what price the latest managerial merry-go-round stopping some time soon on the banks of the River Trent?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
