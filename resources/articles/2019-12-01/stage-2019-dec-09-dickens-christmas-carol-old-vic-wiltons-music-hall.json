Within a year, A Christmas Carol had spawned nine stage shows, 127 recitals by the author and a pirated version (Dickens, a crusader not only for Christmas cheer but also for copyright, promptly sued). It hasn\u2019t stopped jolting tears and pricking consciences ever since, with its Christian message for a more compassionate capitalism in the face of child poverty. Except two new London productions are not singing from the same carol sheet about grumpy old men made good. Jack Thorne\u2019s adaptation is the tried-and-tested one, now in its third run at the Old Vic (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606) and also currently on Broadway. A handsome production, it uses every bell and whistle to try and melt the hardest heart, from carol singing to handbell ringing, a stupendous feast in which food is whizzed down to the stage from the gods and a snow-flurry across the auditorium that only mildly whiffs of washing-up liquid. Matthew Warchus, as director, and Rob Howell, as set and costume designer, ramp up the spectacle with dangling lanterns and lugubrious light and shadows when the three ghosts, all female, appear. The stage is multipronged in shape, reaching into the audience and occasionally inviting participation. Paterson Joseph\u2019s Scrooge is not an enfeebled old man but an angry physical presence; he twitches his muscles, speaks in stentorian tones and wipes a sea of sweat from his brow. It is a muscular interpretation of the moneylender but does not allow vulnerability in early enough, so Scrooge\u2019s Damascene transformation feels too sudden. \u201cThere is much about comfort in the story,\u201d wrote GK Chesterton of Dickens\u2019s story and Thorne\u2019s iteration offers very traditional comforts, mince pies notwithstanding. It feels polished but twee by the time Tiny Tim (Rayhaan Kufuor-Gray, one of four actors in the role) rings the final handbell and wrings (some of) our hearts. At Wilton\u2019s Music Hall, Piers Torday\u2019s radical Christmas Carol \u2013 A Fairy Tale (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) could not be further from tradition; even the turkey is spared from death thanks to a vegan alternative. Scrooge is not Scrooge as we know him either but a \u201cher\u201d \u2013 Ebenezer\u2019s sister, Fan, who dies in the novella. Here we find she married Marley and lived with him in miserable marital bondage. Fan Scrooge is not Dickens\u2019s morally deficient \u201cwrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner\u201d, although she has shut up her heart after feeling undermined in Victorian society. Sally Dexter is a bonneted, severe-looking woman with a passing resemblance to Miss Havisham who occasionally speaks with clunky stridency (\u201cI am a woman and I have lived a life men made for me\u201d). More often, she is quick-witted and wry. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d she tells Marley when his apparition appears in chains, and then: \u201cI want a divorce.\u201d Guided in part by Friedrich Engels\u2019s The Condition of the Working Class in England (a Christmas present from Bob Cratchit), she invents her own happy ending in which she buys a school for fallen women, turns it into \u201cFran\u2019s School for Empowered Young Women\u201d and enlists Ann Cratchit to run it. Everything about this production is delightfully surprising and subversive, even if it feels occasionally scrappy. The satire on gender works on the whole; the ghosts are imaginatively conceived, particularly that of the present \u2013 a giant puppet (voiced by Edward Harrison) who has embraced new-age philosophies on how to live in \u201cthe now\u201d. The ghost of the future is reminiscent of an MR James spectre made of twisted bedsheets (the role is jointly played by Chisara Agor and Ruth Ollman), and projects Fan into the modern day to witness the burdens of the professional woman, multitasking to harrowing degrees. Jo Lakin\u2019s puppetry is used to charming effect and if Tom Piper\u2019s set design is not as grand as Howell\u2019s, it is still fluid and conjures ghostliness. Torday tells us that Dickens\u2019s own daughter, Katey, felt he never understood women. But \u201cif the courses be departed from, the ends will change\u201d, says Scrooge in Dickens\u2019s story. Maybe this new ending offers both the story, and its 19th-century writer, a welcome 21st-century transformation. A Christmas Carol is at the Old Vic, London, until 18 January. Christmas Carol \u2013 A Fairy Tale is at Wilton\u2019s Music Hall, London, until 4 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
