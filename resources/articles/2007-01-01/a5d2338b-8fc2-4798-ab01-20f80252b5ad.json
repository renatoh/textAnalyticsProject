The chain's easy fitting jeans, its forest of khaki and its simple T-shirts were wardrobe staples on both sides of the Atlantic. But after a long decline, the future of the American chain is in doubt as its founders ponder a sale or a break-up of the retail empire. It emerged this week that California-based Gap had called in investment bank Goldman Sachs to review its options. A catastrophic Christmas has proved the last straw after two years of stubbornly falling sales - including an alarming slump in takings at its 134 stores in Britain. So what has gone wrong with the chain which began in 1969 as a single store on San Francisco's Ocean Avenue? The statistics tell a story of slow, steady, decline. In 23 out of the last 24 months, Gap's like-for-like sales have fallen. Its December sales were $2.34bn (\u00a31.2bn), down 10% on 2004 and its shares are less than half the level of their peak in 2000. In Britain, same-store sales dropped by well over 8% in the usually busy Christmas run-up, piling pressure on European boss Stephen Sunnucks. Experts say the rot set in 10 years ago. Robert Buchanan, a retail analyst at the American stockbroker AG Edwards, says: \"In their heyday, they were really good at taking care of the baby boomer customer who, about 10 years ago, stopped spending as much time and money in the middle of the mall. They stopped targeting them and started aiming for the children of the boomers - but not having done much research, they blew it. Then they took a democratic approach and tried to be all things to all men. If there's one thing that doesn't work in retailing, it's a lack of focus.\" Opaque Gap's concept used to be crisp and clear. The first store was the brainchild of Donald Fisher, an estate agent who grew weary with trying to find jeans amid the jumble of department stores. In a 724-page self-published memoir, Falling into the Gap, he says he viewed retailing with an estate agent's eye, making the most out of square footage by creating a honeycomb of cubicles selling Levi Strauss jeans. His wife, Doris, came up with the name as an abbreviation of the generation gap, and they aimed for the hip young things of San Francisco who wanted to buy music with their clothes. The music was soon dropped, Levis were abandoned and Gap created its own clothes brand. It expanded aggressively during the 1980s and 1990s with bold advertising campaigns shot by Annie Leibowitz. Sharon Stone established the firm's position in the zeitgeist by wearing a Gap T-shirt to the Oscars in 1995. The group has two other main chains in the US - cheap, cheerful Old Navy and smaller, pricier Banana Republic - and its worldwide estate runs to 3,157 stores, making it America's biggest specialist clothes retailer. Britain is its largest international market, ahead of Japan, Canada and France. About 153,000 people work for the company. Some suggest Gap's sharp sense of customers' tastes evaporated when long-serving chief executive Mickey Drexler left in 2002. He was replaced by a former head of Disney's theme parks, Paul Pressler, whose background is in marketing, rather than fashion. Patricia Edwards, a fund manager specialising in retail at Wentworth, Hauser &amp; Violich in Seattle, says: \"I don't think anyone knows who they're trying to appeal to any more. Is it a 25-year-old or a 40-year-old?\" Wall Street is adamant that Gap cannot continue as it is. Too many re-launches have foundered - last year's widely hyped efforts included dresses created by the renowned designer Roland Mouret and advertising featuring Audrey Hepburn, Helen Mirren and Seal. The firm's prime high-street positions demand rapidly ringing tills to pay the rent. In London, for example, Gap has a shop on Piccadilly Circus plus four more dotted along Oxford Street. The Fisher family holds 36% of Gap's shares. Donald, 77, and Doris are still on the board and their son, Robert, is chairman. Their intentions are opaque but some suggest they might seek financial backing to take the company private. Funding, says Ms Edwards, would be hard to find: \"I don't know how you would fix Gap. It would involve getting a lot of talent in on the merchandising side and it would be very expensive. Private equity usually involves a focus on costs - not on investing in merchandising.\" More likely is a spin-off of Gap's more successful Banana Republic chain and possibly of Old Navy too. But that would leave a Gap chain with a doubtful future. In Britain retail consultancy Verdict says Gap's share of the clothing market has dropped by a quarter over three years to 1.2%. Mr Sunnucks, a former New Look boss, was recruited in 2005 to run Gap's European arm and he has created a dedicated buying and design team to cater more specifically to British tastes. But the results will not be in the shops until late this year. \"Reversing the company's worldwide comparable sales declines is an enormous task,\" says Verdict. \"Gap has already lost customers in the UK and it will be difficult to regain them, even if its offer is in fact more compelling to a UK audience.\" Evidence of a crisis mounted this week as two senior executives abruptly departed including Denise Johnston, the president of Gap Adult, who joined the company only nine months ago. A spokesman at Gap's US head office said: \"We've acknowledged that where our two largest brands are concerned, results over the holidays and the recent past have been disappointing. With the board's active involvement, the management team is re-examining the brands' respective strategies.\" Shareholders are pressing for radical change - and the international business, described as \"horrible\" by one US analyst, is under close scrutiny. Gone, say critics, are the days when Gap genuinely filled a gap in the high street."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
