Too few children make it on to a badminton court or get to have a go at archery, table tennis or sailing. As we celebrate the achievements of Kelly Holmes and Amir Khan, we should note, too, that state-school children are still under-represented among Britain's Olympic medallists. We must give credit where credit is due: the imbalance of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, when only 20 per cent of Britain's medallists came from state schools, has been considerably corrected by an injection of lottery cash. In Athens, 60 per cent of our champions now come from state-school backgrounds. But given that 93 per cent of children are in the state sector, more needs to be done to encourage them to excel. Earlier last week, Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, promised to bring back competitive sports to schools, as if this in itself were enough to ensure a new generation of Olympians. Certainly, competition is good for children who want to compete and do well, but introduced in the wrong way, it is certain to switch off many more children who already see themselves as unsporty, yet who would benefit most from more physical activity. Far more important is to make exercise an enjoyable and attainable pursuit for all. For this, Britain has to start teaching sports properly, through coaches who know how to encourage children who expect to come last. It's not an easy task, but it is achievable and would contribute more to getting Britain fit than anti-obesity messages. An 11-year-old who manages to run 100 metres for the first time is just as important as the future medal winner. Excellence and enjoyment are not mutually exclusive. That is the important lesson to teachers and ministers from Athens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
