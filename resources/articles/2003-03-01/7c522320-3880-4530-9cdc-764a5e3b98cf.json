A meeting of local authority leaders agreed to table the offer when the two sides meet at the conciliation service Acas tomorrow. The employers said in a brief statement: \"After a month of talks at Acas, UK fire employers will make an offer to Fire Brigades Union negotiators tomorrow linking significantly improved pay to modernisation of the fire service. The employers refused to give details of the new offer, but there was speculation they will propose a three year deal worth around 16%. A suggested deal worth 11% over two years was rejected by the union last year, while the two sides were close to agreeing a 16% agreement over two years before the government intervened. The employers made it clear that pay would be linked to modernising the fire service, but they hoped the move would finally lead to a deal to end the bitter row."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
