Spurs\u2019 2-0 win over Arsenal returned them to the top of the Premier League, closing out a seemingly fiendish run in which they defeated Manchester City by the same score and earned a goalless draw at Chelsea. Mourinho believes they have demonstrated a maturity for which few were prepared. \u201cWe grew up,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI can imagine lots of people can imagine three matches in a row [against those teams] would be a moment for us to drop points and go back to \u2018normality\u2019, but we didn\u2019t go back to \u2018normality\u2019. We are there. I believe [it is] one more week at the top of the table.\u201d Harry Kane\u2019s 11th goal in 12 appearances against Arsenal made him the north London derby\u2019s all-time top scorer. Son Heung\u2011min had broken the deadlock and the pair set up each other\u2019s goals in the first half, meaning they have combined to score 10 in the top-flight this season and 31 in total. Only Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba have a more prolific partnership in the Premier League era. \u201cHarry and Sonny are world-class players and at the top of what they do offensively,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThey have a good sense of the balance we need and also do incredible work for the team when it doesn\u2019t have the ball.\u201d Kane was similarly enthusiastic about their relationship, saying the pair could be \u201ccoming into our prime\u201d. They had few opportunities in a second half Mikel Arteta\u2019s team completely dominated, although Arsenal came close only through headers from Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre\u2011Emerick Aubameyang. \u201cYou are winning 2-0, why would you expose your defensive block if you don\u2019t have to?\u201d Mourinho said, before heaping praise on his counterpart. \u201cIt was a very difficult game. I can imagine the headlines will be about them not being in a good position but I believe with these players, and Mikel, it will be Arsenal v Tottenham again.\u201d Arsenal sit 11 points behind Spurs and were further hindered by Thomas Partey\u2019s aggravation of a thigh injury before Kane\u2019s goal in first-half stoppage time. Arteta praised his side\u2019s \u201cpersonality, courage and passion\u201d but clear chances were few. They aimed 44 crosses into the box but, in what has become an unwelcome theme, struggled to make them count. \u201cAt the moment it looks like we need a lot to score a goal,\u201d Arteta said, admitting a run of five defeats in seven games must stop. \u201cWe need to score goals. If not, it\u2019s unsustainable. It doesn\u2019t matter what we do in other departments of the pitch: if we don\u2019t score goals, we can do nothing. So we need to put the ball into the net, urgently.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
