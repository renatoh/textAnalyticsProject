Lewis is 10 when he helplessly watches his mother drown, and within a few months has a needy, nervous stepmother with whom to contend. Forced to bury his grief by a cold disciplinarian father, Lewis expresses his pain in violent outbursts, spending two years in prison and cutting his arms as a release. In the same Hertfordshire village, Lewis's childhood friend Kit suffers beatings at the hands of her abusive father. The stifling summer of 1957 erupts when violence, sex, parental responsibility, love and emotion become fatally muddled. Will Kit and Lewis remain intact and find their way to each other amid the mess? A tragic account of the devastating effects of parental abuse and the redemptive power of true love."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
