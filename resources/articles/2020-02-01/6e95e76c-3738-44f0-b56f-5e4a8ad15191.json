Samba! Street crime! Red-faced Rio highlights the negative", "bodyText": "When marketing Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\u2019s national tourism agency typically focuses on the city\u2019s world-class beaches, samba-filled music scene and caipirinha-fueled parties. Violent crime is rarely listed among the attractions. But in an embarrassing social media cock-up this week, Embratur, the Brazilian tourist board, accidentally shared a critical Instagram post from a tourist who did not enjoy her stay in the so-called \u201cCidade Maravilhosa,\u201d or Marvellous City. The Instagram post started promisingly enough \u2013 \u201cRio is such a beautiful city\u201d \u2013 but it quickly took a darker turn. \u201cI just spent three days in Rio with my family, and in those three days my family and I were robbed and my nine-year-old sister witnessed a violent robbery\u201d. The disgruntled visitor concluded: \u201cI can\u2019t recommend a visit to a city where I felt afraid of even leaving the apartment.\u201d Embratur deleted the shared post on Wednesday. It said in a subsequent statement that \u201csharing [the post] was a mistake,\u201d adding that it had worked hard to promote a nationwide fall in crime in 2019. Safety concerns along with inconvenient flights, poor infrastructure and high costs have long held back Brazil\u2019s tourism industry, which lags behind its South American neighbours. As news of the mistake went viral, withlai, who identified herself as a Brazilian living in Europe, said in another Instagram post that she hoped \u201cthe person [at Embratur] doesn\u2019t get in trouble, we all make mistakes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
