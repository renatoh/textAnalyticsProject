Ms Jowell said the government would consider David Elstein's radical proposals, part of a report on the future of the BBC commissioned by the Conservative party, in its review of the corporation's charter. But she rejected the report's main recommendations, saying they went against the government's wish for a \"strong and independent\" BBC. \"We are pursuing a charter review that is genuinely open, so to that extent we will accept the Elstein report as a contribution to the debate. However, its prescription is for a weak, small BBC and we do not believe that is what the British people want,\" Ms Jowell said today. \"The proposals in this Tory report could only lead to a weak and insignificant BBC. It makes no reference to the importance of the BBC as a news organisation committed to accuracy, balance and fairness, nor does it mention the important contribution made by the BBC to children's programming, education, coverage of the UK's nations and regions, or of the arts and culture. \"In contrast, we regard the BBC as a British success story, admired round the world and highly regarded at home.\" Mr Elstein's proposals are being considered by the Conservatives, who have already indicated they might support the abolition of the BBC's governors. But Ms Jowell's wholehearted rejection of them will go some way to reassuring those who feared the government could use its review of the BBC's charter to punish the BBC over the Iraq dossier row. Ms Jowell has given out mixed signals on the impact the Hutton report, which condemned the BBC's \"defective\" editorial systems, will have on the review of the BBC's royal charter. During Lord Hutton's inquiry, the culture secretary said his conclusions would have no bearing on the BBC's future. But after the publication of his damning conclusions she said she would \"take into account\" the report's findings. Mr Elstein argues that the licence fee should be scrapped because the BBC's dependence on it leaves the corporation at the mercy of the government, which sets the annual charge. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
