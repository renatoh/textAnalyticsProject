This was the kind of comment that drove John Ruskin to write his five-volume treatise Modern Painters, praising Turner as the greatest landscape painter ever - and, in order to make his case, rewriting aesthetics and the history of art. Born in London, the son of a Covent Garden barber, Turner trained in the Royal Academy Schools and showed his first watercolour at the RA in 1790, when he was 15; he travelled compulsively, first around Britain and then Europe. His house and gallery, which he designed along comparable lines to his friend Sir John Soane's house at Lincoln's Inn Fields, became a byword for squalor as he let it rot. Turner was also an enthusiastic poet, the author of an epic entitled The Fallacies of Hope. Not even Ruskin tried to make any claim for it. Subject: The artist, in his early to mid-20s. Distinguishing features: This is a Romantic self-image. Turner's eyes are rock-steady, piercing, almost like a bird's. All about him are shadows and mystery. With his unkempt hair, his white neckerchief and silver waistcoat, he paints himself as a hero, staring us down unblinkingly. By painting himself head-on, however, Turner also does his best to minimise the effect of his huge nose. This feature was captured far more cruelly in a profile portrait of him at the age of 17 by George Dance, in which, with his long hair and homely features, Turner looks like a French revolutionary hooligan. He is a revolutionary in this painting, too, but an intellectual and aesthetic one. By depicting himself in tenebrous, intense isolation, he sets himself apart as an artist with a mission. It is superbly dramatic. The unlit background sets him off and seems empty, as if it were deep space and he were a star. He is all light: his blond hair, ruddy cheeks, scarf and waistcoat glow. As a self-portrait, it is also distinctive in what it leaves out. Painters tended to depict themselves in the act of painting. That is how we see Sir Joshua Reynolds in his Self-Portrait (c1747-9) or William Hogarth in his from c1757, both in the National Portrait Gallery. Yet Turner does not even hold a brush. In this painting, like Rembrandt in many of his self-portraits, Turner shows himself as just a face and a mind, without any social or professional attributes. The comparison with Rembrandt is surely intended. The shadowiness around Turner and his glowing flesh seem to emulate the Dutch master. By painting himself in this way, Turner asserts that art takes place in the head. His art is one not of appearance but of imagination. He does not show you something, but provokes you to imagine it. This portrait is a manifesto for the way his works try to awaken the inner eye. Inspirations and influences: Although Rembrandt provided plenty of models of self-portraits as a young man, it is his late Self-Portrait at the Age of 63 (1669), in the National Gallery, of which this portrait's sombre intensity reminds you. James Barry's Self-Portrait (c1802) in the National Gallery of Ireland and Goya's (1815), in the Academia de San Fernando, Madrid, are equally brooding. But the closest analogy for the heroic presence Turner lends himself is in contemporary portraits of Napoleon - for whom Turner had a certain sympathy, as can be seen in War: The Exile and the Rock Limpet (1842), his painting of the former French emperor on St Helena.
