Norwich have announced that every home game will see 1,500 tickets available for sale at \u00a330 to casual home fans which, alongside 22,000 season tickets, will make up the home allocation at the 27,000-capacity Carrow Road. The \u00a330 figure matches the cap levied by the Premier League on away tickets since 2016. \u201cWe believe as a football club that we have phenomenal support and we shouldn\u2019t price people out of football\u201d, said the chief operating officer, Ben Kensell. \u201cSo we decided that if \u00a330 is fair for away supporters, then \u00a330 is also fair for home supporters considering the price of a home ticket the last time we were in the Premier League. \u201cNo one in the ground from a general admission perspective next season will pay more than \u00a330. That, as a club, sets us apart and we\u2019re really proud of that. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d The most recent research from the Premier League found the average price of a home match ticket in the division was \u00a331 but this included the costs of season tickets which are often available at a discounted per-match rate. In 2018 just over half the 20 Premier League sides priced their most expensive tickets at around \u00a340 but non-season ticket seats at Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium can cost up to \u00a397. Norwich\u2019s new scheme has been hailed by some supporters but the club also came under fire for tying the reduced price to a new membership scheme. Fans must pay \u00a350 to qualify for the general admission tickets and a similar system is being put into place for away tickets, with some supporters claiming the ability to pay is being valued more highly than loyalty. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an away membership before,\u201d Kensell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a points system instead and, whilst it has been effective over the years, it\u2019s quite antiquated now. We\u2019ve looked at what other Premier League clubs do and looked at what we need to do, spoken with fans and therefore we\u2019ve brought in a two-tier away membership. \u201cI appreciate this level of change will be unsettling to begin with and there will be many different opinions on whether this is a positive or negative step forward but ultimately, as a club, we believe it\u2019s the right thing to tackle the supply and demand issue and ensure that its fair for all supporters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
