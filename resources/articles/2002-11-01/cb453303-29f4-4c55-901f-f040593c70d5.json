The Italian city has seen many of its dusty old leather houses, such as Prada and Gucci, transformed into multinational brands. Could the factories of Northampton, the embattled centre of English shoemaking where Little has his footwear made, do the same? \"I can't imagine Northampton could ever become a fashion capital,\" he says. \"The culture is just not that at all. They make wonderful shoes, but they don't know why certain products become fashionable, and they don't want to know. They really don't want to spend their time understanding what the youth of Tokyo thinks is the next big thing.\" Which is why Tim Little is growing his business in a small, steady and very English way. He has had his own shop on the King's Road in London since 1997, but it is situated so deep down the unfashionable Fulham end that you would only have seen it if you had got lost on the way to Chelsea football ground. He has had to convince men of the value of well-made footwear as well as gain the trust of the factories to use their old methods on new styles. But in the last few months Little has expanded to become a nationally recognised brand. He occupies an impressive space on the men's floor of the newly revamped Liberty, is stocked by Selfridges and Gieves &amp; Hawkes, and has recently opened stores in Birmingham and Nottingham. Still, the growth rate is kept under control. Little is working with an industry so endangered that one worker's illness can close down production for a week, a far cry from the time when most of the country's shoes came from the city. \"Thirty years ago most of the shoes that men bought in this country were made in Northampton,\" says Little. \"Now most of the manufacturing has gone abroad and it's become a niche business dominated by five or six factories. When I started I was helped by a 70-year-old who had been in the shoe business for 50 years. We would drive around Northampton and he would say, 'See that restaurant? That used to make 500 pairs of shoes a week. And that car park over there? It was the biggest shoe factory in the country.' \" Little used to work in advertising, but started his business out of frustration at not being able to satisfy his obsession with traditional shoes - he couldn't find enough of them. \"It was one of those people-like-me things,\" he explains. \"I've always loved English shoes and the way they get better the more you wear them. I thought that if I felt that strongly about it, there must be enough men who feel the same to make a difference.\" To make sure such men aren't scared away, there is nothing overtly fashionable about Little's range. Based around a core of brogues, loafers and boots, the designs rely on attention to detail than short-term gimmicks. They are all made on handmade lasts, the traditional wooden blocks made to the shape of feet which determine the fit of the shoe, and are finished with time-consuming stitching rather than shoddier short-cut methods. So far, so traditional. But it is the slowly evolving design that makes the brand stand out. While most English shoes stick to standard patterns, Little investigates changing styles such as the increasingly prevalent squared-off toe or the purposefully asymetric last. By doing so, what at first appears to be an old-fashioned shoe actually looks slick and modern when placed next to something that conforms to the traditional rules. Little also pushes the design when he can, scoring a bestseller with his retro-looking trainers, or creating something covetable out of something ugly with his version of a Scandinavian curling boot (currently a very fashionable women's style). To make it all as accessible to the shop-fearing man as possible, he then names the styles after the sort of blues music that is always playing in his stores. Even though Little's business is expanding by taking English shoes in a new direction, the future of industry in Northampton could seal his fate. The brand Church's was bought by Prada in 1999, but so far the hoped-for injection of lifeblood into the city by the Milan fashion house has yet to transpire. Little is concerned about what will happen when the long-standing workers retire. \"Years ago when there was a big industry and you went into shoe-making after school, you were guaranteed a job for life,\" he explains. \"But now there are only a few factories and it's too much of a risk for young people to commit to learning the skills and then things start to dry up. It would be a tragedy for that to happen.\" The size of Little's business is not enough to save Northampton but nothing ever moves quickly in menswear, and the steady pace at which the brand is growing will, hopefully, help to change the perception that traditional shoes are dowdy. It is a difficult job, since most men under 30 have spent all of their adult lives damaging the bone structure of their feet by wearing trainers. But after wearing the shoes for a while, the inherent quality of the English-made product should convince easily. \"If you could just walk every shoe-buyer around one of these factories in Northampton for half an hour, everyone would buy shoes from there,\" says Little. \"You wouldn't believe what goes into them.\" The learning curve is so slow that until men learn by experience, Little can only rely on the product. \"All we can do is do it well,\" he says, \"and then do it better.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
