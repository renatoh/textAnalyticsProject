Asked whether he and Abbott would \u201cmake up\u201d, he replied: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing personal, nothing personal, it\u2019s just business.\u201d In an interview on Melbourne radio, Turnbull confirmed reports he was sounded out about the ambassador\u2019s job earlier this year, but suggested he did not give it any serious consideration. \u201cI was and I declined ... regardless of whether I was the prime minister, whatever my situation, I cannot imagine a situation where I would want to be an ambassador, with all due respect to ambassadors ... it\u2019s not my cup of tea,\u201d Turnbull said. Abbott has given several radio interviews since he was ousted as prime minister. Asked in one about Turnbull, he said pointedly: \u201cI might exercise the former prime minister\u2019s prerogative of silence \u2013 there\u2019s obviously been a lot of dirty water under the bridge. \u201cI have often said Malcolm didn\u2019t stay in government to be somebody else\u2019s minister.\u201d Turnbull used his 3AW interview to continue to differentiate himself from his predecessor in tone, if not yet in substantive policy changes. He sought to lower the temperature of the debate over reductions to Sunday penalty rates, saying it was in the first instance an issue for the Fair Work Commission, but also that it was important to negotiate any changes with unions so they were persuaded workers were not worse off overall. \u201cI think over time you will see a move to a more flexible workplace ... you do nonetheless have unions and workers who are naturally reluctant to give up benefits they have and any reform has got to be able to demonstrate that people are not going to be worse off and overall, ideally, in net terms better off ... it is important for someone in my position as prime minister to be able to empathise with the position of employers and workers and to understand that each have legitimate claims,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to get the support of workers and of unions ... to changes like that then inevitably you would have to persuade them in net terms they are better off ... If you put yourself in the shoes of a union official and you have someone saying \u2018I want you to give up certain conditions or work practices which are inflexible or create inefficiencies\u2019, then you as the union organiser would say, \u2018I would only consider that if I was better off or at least no worse off\u2019.\u201d Turnbull declined to use the former prime minister\u2019s term \u201cdeath cult\u2019 for Islamic State (Isis), or Daesh, saying he would choose his own language for what was a \u201cviolent, extremist terrorist organisation which is a threat both regionally and globally\u201d. He confirmed the government was still considering the controversial laws to strip citizenship from dual nationals and the recent recommendations for substantial amendments from the joint committee on intelligence and security."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
