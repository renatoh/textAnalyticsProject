Mr Lukashenko, dubbed \"Europe's last dictator\" by Washington, has not been seen in public since he gave a press conference on March 20 defending his 83% win. Yesterday the presidential press secretary, Pavel Lyokhi, said: \"The president is absolutely healthy, and at work.\" State TV showed footage of him meeting officials, and the Interfax news agency quoted him as asking bureaucrats to take down his portrait from their office walls. Yet no explanation was given for delaying his inauguration, originally planned for Friday. Mr Lyokhi said that date had never been officially confirmed by Mr Lukashenko's administration. \"It is not technically correct to talk of a delay,\" he said, adding that he could not say when the ceremony would be. The opposition, who have said the president is \"illegitimate\" and demanded new, freer elections, said footage of Mr Lukashenko shown on state TV yesterday was old. \"I've been watching specially, and it's old film they're showing,\" said Pavel Mazhaika, press secretary to the main opposition candidate, Alexander Milinkevich. A western diplomat said he too had seen no new footage. \"He's just won one of the most hefty majorities we've ever seen, but he's not out there waving to the people.\" The diplomat said he could not understand why the inauguration had to be put off. \"It must be his health. He is physically in A1 shape so it must be something that is stress-related.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
