The element of novelty was perhaps yet to erode, but more importantly there was an understanding that others in the community were doing it far tougher. Boredom inside a hotel room, naturally, was preferable to losing one\u2019s job altogether. In recent weeks, however, the narrative has shifted. Players have made it abundantly clear that life within bubbles, while necessary in a Covid-19 world, has been a mentally draining experience. England quick Jofra Archer was unequivocal. \u201cYou\u2019re just counting days down,\u201d he said inside the the Indian Premier League\u2019s UAE hub. England\u2019s white ball skipper Eoin Morgan said the current situation was \u201cuntenable\u201d while Steve Smith, when asked if he would enter the Big Bash League hub after Australia\u2019s upcoming series against India, was similarly defiant: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you \u2013 absolutely no chance.\u201d Reflecting on their recently concluded summer, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s chief medical officer found that players and staff had a ceiling of just \u201cthree to four weeks\u201d inside the restrictive UK bubbles. \u201cAfter that, you need time out,\u201d Dr Nick Peirce said. Despite the warning, some of Australia\u2019s top male cricketers face the prospect of a much longer period inside. Almost five months, in fact. The likes of Smith, David Warner, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood have already been inside hubs since late August; first in the UK and now the UAE. When the IPL concludes next week, they will fly home for a fortnight of quarantine, before entering various hubs around the country for a series against India that concludes in late January. It raises the question of whether Cricket Australia might grant players a break on wellbeing grounds during this all-important summer. Coach Justin Langer has already forecast decisions that \u201cpeople won\u2019t agree with\u201d. But, he said, \u201cour people, our players, our staff are high priority for us to make sure they\u2019re healthy and happy\u201d. The issue of mental health in the sport has become a pertinent one in recent years, and one the governing body is taking very seriously after a number of high-profile players took extended breaks from the game. This, in part, prompted CA to appoint a mental health lead. Dr Hassan Mahmood, a UK consultant psychiatrist with expertise in the mental health of elite cricketers, said CA was a \u201cleader\u201d in the space. He noted the prospect of almost 150 days inside a hub, however, was worrying. \u201cThat\u2019s quite concerning. From the limited feedback we have had from players [in the UK], there has been concern expressed about spending extended periods of time within the bubble, and also their sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Covid-19 hit the world, I felt this topic would become more of an issue. If you\u2019re going to be playing cricket for weeks, or even months on end, without being able to leave the bubble, it is going to be tough.\u201d Currently, CA is operating hubs in Adelaide (for the Sheffield Shield) and Sydney (WBBL). South Australia\u2019s Jake Weatherald has already departed the hub for mental health reasons, while England spinner Sophie Ecclestone turned down a contract with Perth Scorchers altogether. Dr Mahmood stressed the importance of on-hand psychologists with teams this summer, and mental health literacy programs which allowed players to recognise the signs and symptoms when things were not quite right. Pleasingly, it appears both CA and the players\u2019 union, the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association, are well prepared to navigate the upcoming summer. The ACA\u2019s general manager of player development and wellbeing, Justine Whipper, confirmed to Guardian Australia that a joint team had met weekly for the last few months to discuss plans. This included Michael Lloyd (Australian men\u2019s team psychologist), Peter Clarke (Australian women\u2019s team psychologist) and Lyndel Abbott (ACA\u2019s in-house psychologist), who worked with the Australian team at the Rio Olympic Games. Whipper said they were encouraging players to \u201cself-manage\u201d within the hubs as best they can. That is, to be armed with practical, go-to strategies to combat what might be a tough few months. Under a traffic light system, they encouraged players to recognise the relevant signs. \u201cGreen light is when you\u2019re thriving, orange is when you\u2019re starting to get a bit stressed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we want them to sit in the orange light for a short period of time and go back to green, rather than go down to red. We\u2019re trying to empower them to be self-aware how they\u2019re feeling.\u201d Sydney Sixers allrounder Lisa Griffith, currently inside the WBBL \u201cvillage\u201d at Sydney Olympic Park, said these preparations had been important. \u201cWe did some work with team psychologists to find what does \u2018not-OK me\u2019 look like, and what could potentially trigger that. We delved into that before we came in so there\u2019s a plan of attack if things aren\u2019t going OK.\u201d All eight WBBL teams are housed inside the village, including Sydney-based players who will remain inside for the tournament\u2019s five-week duration. Griffith credited Cricket NSW, the ACA and the Sixers with acknowledging mental health support needed to be greater this season. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own mental health struggles and I feel very supported in here. They\u2019ve done a really good job of recognising that the support we have had needed to be more. So coming into an environment that really underlines mental health issues when you\u2019re stuck inside, they\u2019ve put programs and structures in place to really help us.\u201d Getting to know on-field rivals, Griffith said, had been the village\u2019s most positive outcome and a \u201chumanising\u201d experience. The allrounder said that the last few weeks of the tournament, however, could prove difficult from a mental health perspective given the restriction of movement and mounting losses for some teams. \u201cI know there\u2019s people in here, even one of my mates, who\u2019s not going as well\u2026there\u2019s people who aren\u2019t coping very well with this hub life, which I think is natural.\u201d Earlier in her career Griffith took a break for mental health reasons, and has since spoken publicly about her struggles. She joins a growing list of cricketers, including the likes of Moises Henriques and Glenn Maxwell, who have done the same. Whipper said these actions made things easier for others to come. \u201cEvery time someone puts up their hand, it makes it easier for the next person to do the same. They have been such an impetus for change.\u201d She said that while the upcoming summer might present certain challenges, significant progress in the mental health space held them in good stead. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of research on this recently and there is such a significant change in help-seeking in the last three to six years. It\u2019s quite phenomenal. Players that feel comfortable within their environment and reaching out for help has increased dramatically.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
