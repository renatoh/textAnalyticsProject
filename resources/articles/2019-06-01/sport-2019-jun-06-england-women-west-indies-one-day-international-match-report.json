The victory was set up by Amy Jones, the player of the match, who hit 91, her highest home ODI score. \u201cSince last summer my confidence has carried on increasing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying putting in consistent performances and hopefully I can carry on throughout the summer. Home series always feel that extra bit special, I\u2019ve got family here and it\u2019s nice to do it in front of a home crowd.\u201d Jones and Tammy Beaumont laid the foundations early on, the pair racking up England\u2019s sixth 50-plus opening stand in the side\u2019s past 12 ODIs. Along the way Beaumont brought up her 2,000th ODI run in fitting fashion, hammering Shamilia Connell through midwicket for four. Beaumont went for 32, caught in the deep, advancing down the pitch to Hayley Matthews; five balls later Sarah Taylor was also heading back to the pavilion, chipping the ball straight to midwicket to continue her difficult run of form. For years Jones was no more than Taylor\u2019s understudy; here, though, it was her time to shine, alongside the captain, Heather Knight, who hit 94. \u201cWe were under a little bit of pressure at the start after the two wickets but she came out and played her shots and she was brilliant,\u201d Jones said of her 146-run partnership with Knight. \u201cIt\u2019s good fun batting with her \u2013 she always knows what to say and how to keep you focused. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about hitting the ground running. It\u2019s not been a strength of ours in previous series so I\u2019m chuffed,\u201d said Knight. \u201cWe want to keep improving as individuals and as a team and I think we\u2019re doing that.\u201d For both the disappointment will be that they missed out on hundreds which were there for the taking \u2013 Jones holing out to mid-off nine runs short of a first century in international cricket. Knight\u2019s dismissal was equally tame, top-edging a sweep to Connell at short fine-leg. After a clatter of wickets, ending hopes of a mammoth England total, the No 11 Sophie Ecclestone finished things in style with a huge six over deep midwicket off the last ball of the innings. In truth it was always going to be too many for a West Indies batting lineup which is much depleted by the absence of the opener Deandra Dottin. Matthews and Stafanie Taylor both went cheaply \u2013 Taylor the victim of a resurgent Kate Cross, who appears to have gained a yard of pace over the winter; Brunt\u2019s fiery opening spell yielded two wickets in two balls. Ecclestone and Laura Marsh then wrapped things up between them with three wickets apiece with England now having gone 1-0 up in the three-match series in decisive fashion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
