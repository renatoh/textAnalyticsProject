That\u2019s rich", "bodyText": "As ever, the King James version adds a literary edge to one of the most dramatic tales of the Old Testament. In Genesis 18:24, Abraham is appealing to God\u2019s good nature as he attempts to save the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah from the Almighty\u2019s ultimate sanction. \u201cPeradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein,\u201d the desperate patriarch solicits his maker. In the end, Abraham\u2019s pleas come to naught as he couldn\u2019t even name one good man, let alone 50, and so the cities are duly consumed by fire and brimstone. Now, I\u2019m not suggesting for a minute that Panama, the Las Vegas of the rich and infamous, is about to meet a fiery denouement just yet. After all, God\u2019s ire seems to have softened since those biblical early days when He favoured a no-nonsense approach. And, as the leaked Mossack and Fonseca documents show, if Panama was to be turned to dust where would that leave the UK? As the Times declared last week: \u201cNo other country in the world maintains and indulges a network of offshore tax havens as brazen in their defence of unwarranted secrecy as Britain\u2019s overseas territories.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019m sure some enterprising management consultancy could establish a lucrative wee venture engaging with the world\u2019s top gangsters and despots in the following blameless and entirely legal way. I\u2019d suggest they produce a glossy brochure showing how, no matter what crimes against humanity they are ever accused of, not to get too strung up about it all. The brochure would be entitled If you think you\u2019re bad, just look at what\u2019s going on in Cool Britannia. A series of seven seminars and modules would also be offered to tyrants and vagabonds everywhere providing them with something money just can\u2019t buy: solace, geopolitical schadenfreude and a good night\u2019s sleep. 1. Hypocrisy The UK has recently instigated a programme of benefit cuts, advocating that its poorest citizens all tighten their belts to see them through the choppy waters of economic recession. They are being told that everyone is all in it together and that the government is going to make work pay. There will be a clampdown on workshy benefit cheats. For an extra premium we will provide you with a list of all the companies using places such as Panama to avoid tax and show you how the world\u2019s poorest countries are deprived of \u00a3240bn of income by similar practices. 2. Cynicism Are you sick of western democracies lecturing you about ethnic cleansing and enriching yourselves while your people starve? We\u2019ll show you how every spare scrap of land in London is being sold off to unnamed persons to build blocks of \u00a35m luxury flats that will never be occupied. Attached, please see the DVD of the view from the Docklands train. This is called economic cleansing and is the process of removing undesirable taxpayers to make room for the proceeds of global money-laundering. And destroying the concept of social and affordable housing. 3. Graft Political and civic leaders all preach the values of financial rectitude and putting away money for a decent pension. But every Saturday and Sunday (and all other nights when there is football on the telly) they permit dozens of unregulated online gambling outlets to prey on working men as they watch their favourite teams in action. \u201cPlease gamble responsibly,\u201d they say, and then encourage people, when they are at their most vulnerable, to bet on every possible outcome, every hour of the day on every electrical device. Remember this when they take a dim view of Igor and Sergei, your new business partners. 4. Cheating If you ever find yourself resentful at another chinless wonder from the British Embassy lecturing you on human rights abuses this one\u2019s for you. In Scotland, almost half the land is owned by 500 individuals. This came about after illegal and often violent land-grabs 300-400 years ago that have been protected by dubious legislation ever since. After 17 years of so-called \u201cleft-wing\u201d governments their land reform bill is a toothless joke. Scotland is a rich country with great export goods, good universities and stacks of churches. Tonight, though, 250,000 of its children will go without food and 5,000 don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll be sleeping. 5. Warmongering Do you ever get hurt when Britain and its allies routinely describe you as being part of the axis of evil? Doesn\u2019t it make you sick when they insist only they can be trusted with nuclear warheads? Perhaps you ought to know that this moral arbiter of what is good for the rest of the world routinely has sold \u00a35.6bn worth of military hardware to Saudi Arabia, aka The Headless State, since the Tories came to power. During that time, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, the UK has sold weapons to 24 of the 27 states included on its own list of \u201ccountries of humanitarian concern\u201d. 6. Greed Don\u2019t get too upset when the UK tries to excoriate you for your apparent lack of democracy. Instead, just tell them that you won\u2019t take any lessons in this from a state that pimps its own parliament as a place to purchase influence in the laws of the land and where MPs can be bought. All it takes is a tidy six-figure cheque to Tory central office and you\u2019re in. In fact, for the price of a few lunches at Claridge\u2019s and a two grand a month retainer you can get any number of Tories to ensure no one looks too closely at your new bespoke torture chambers. Everything has a price, and that includes parliament. 7. Indifference The next time you\u2019re in London to collect your latest batch of Eurofighters take a note of every time you hear British people congratulating themselves on being the most enlightened and civilised country in the known universe. Then ask yourself why they all look the other way when this is all happening. Their passivity can be bought cheaply with a few royal babies; some gold medals at the next Olympic Games and arranging another one of their wars against another third world country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
