The applause isn't for her music, which has long slipped into anodyne torpor, but for her life. Makeba, who was married to Hugh Masekela and then Stokely Carmichael, was effectively stripped of her citizenship by South Africa's ruling National Party in 1960 while she was in New York. Prevented from returning to her homeland, she was condemned to three decades of peripatetic exile. Her days as a wandering reminder of apartheid's sheer stupidity are long past, but she remains a symbol of an ultimately successful struggle. If anyone deserves to rest on past glories, it is Makeba - Mamma Africa, the empress of African song - and she does. Occasionally, though, when she can get a word in between rounds of applause, the old fire still burns. \"People who do not remember their history have no culture,\" she growls. \"Do not let the children not know who Oliver Tambo was.\" All the goodwill in the world, however, cannot disguise her waning powers. She spends 15 minutes of the mid-paced township jive Amampondo introducing her eight-piece band, she vacates the stage to allow her grand-daughter Zenzi Lee a solo turn, and when she reaches for the notes on MOR ballad In Time, there is no longer anything there. And all this against a musical backdrop that seems more in keeping with the lobby of the Johannesburg Inter-Continental than a Soweto shebeen. It's not all coasting, though. Pata Pata, her gloriously infectious signature tune, still sounds fresh from the veld, and Congolese songwriter Lokua Kanza's Amaliya is a feisty anthem. Africa Is Where My Heart Lies is ripe for a Celine Dion cover version, but its spirit and sentiment encapsulate everything that Makeba stands for. A woman of her stature inevitably radiates dignity, but she's also a hugely endearing presence. \"There's a curfew at 10.30pm,\" she chuckles. \"We must obey the laws. Otherwise we'll all go to jail.\" She can also shimmy across stage (a shuffle here, a dropped shoulder there) surprisingly effectively for a woman of 69-and-a-half. Untaxing, but ultimately rewarding."}, "isHosted": false}}}
