It was originally composed in 1904-05, to a conventional four-movement plan, but radically revised seven years later and compressed into three movements. Composed just two years after that final version, Bax's tumultuous quintet is highly rated by the composer's admirers, and regarded as perhaps the finest of his chamber works, constantly pushing at the limits of what four strings and piano can encompass and often looking forward to his later symphonies. It's certainly the piece that brings the best out of pianist Ashley Wass and the Tippett Quartet, for they attack Bax's huge, teeming first movement with gung-ho intensity that sweeps all before it, and which they sustain right through the work. Their approach to the Bridge is equally robust, but less successful; the music's delicately voiced textures become rather coarsened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
