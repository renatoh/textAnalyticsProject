Maybe they wanted us to be in a situation where we had no alternative but to let him go, but that's not going to happen. \"I was so angry about it but I wanted to make him aware that it does not change anything the club thought 24 hours ago - we want to keep him and have turned it down. Everything tells me he should be starting off with us next year.\" Brooking, a director of the club, said Defoe was an integral part of the club's plans to regain Premiership status at the first attempt. \"I'd like the club to be promoted next season with Jermain getting 25 or 30 goals and if you tell me that at 21 we will have hindered his future development, it's total nonsense. \"I can't see the point in him going to a Premiership club, say, the equivalent of West Ham this year, who aren't in Europe, or a club in the Champions League, where he may be coming off the bench and having to bide his time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
