Ten days ago G\u00e9rard Houllier said that no one should look to him if they wanted to return to the 1960s and 1970s. He was thinking of the lumpen insularity of English football in that period, but the Anfield manager, who was sacked yesterday, ought to have known how his words sounded to supporters. Fan after fan was mesmerised. It was the best idea they'd heard in years. Kevin Keegan followed by Kenny Dalglish, league championships followed by European Cups, Bill Shankly followed by Bob Paisley. Turn back the clock? If only. The stability of yesteryear is almost unattainable in contemporary football since there is the Bosman ruling to keep players on the move and a keen market in managers as well. None the less, the Anfield board need someone who evokes the healthiest aspects of old times. Liverpool have to identify a person to inspire trust with the clarity of his plan and the unswerving fashion in which he pursues it. It is not so long since that authority was evoked as one manager was extolled for taking \"mental ownership\" of a club. The neat phrase was coined by Dermot Desmond, the actual owner of Celtic, and he was talking about Martin O'Neill. By all accounts the Irishman is not wanted by the Liverpool board. Michael Owen is also supposed to dread a life of foraging for knock-downs from a build-up composed of clumping long balls. That is a travesty of O'Neill's approach but not even European victories, including one over Houllier's side, can update the image he had as a horny-handed manager of Leicester City. With a heavy line through O'Neill's name, Liverpool are on a quest for someone with a vivid image of what the club should be and how he might realise it. There can rarely have been a fan swaying on the old Kop who ever supposed that Shankly, Paisley or, for most of his tenure as manager, Dalglish was dithering. Liverpool want to sense the aura of unquestioned command once again and that factor will make them hesitate over appointing Alan Curbishley. That is hard on him and it would be healthy to have an Englishman in charge at one of the top four clubs but his 13 years as manager or co-manager of Charlton have not allowed him even to hint at how he might cope in a more complex environment where players of spectacular wealth and fame are among the powerbrokers. Curbishley could acclimatise spectacularly well, but the Liverpool board will shy away from the danger of installing him until other avenues are exhausted. Rafael Ben\u00edtez appears to fit the bill in some respects. Although H\u00e9ctor Cuper accomplished marvels in creating a strong Valencia side, it kept on falling short of complete achievement. His successor, with the Spanish league title and the Uefa Cup won in the past few weeks, has again shown he is the man to whip a team over the finishing line. In view of the anticlimaxes at Anfield, Liverpool's board must be drawn to such a person, but they must be sure his English is good enough to communicate forcefully. The club should try its hand at kidnapping before pondering Ben\u00edtez or Curbishley. They have a duty to establish whether the fluent Jose Mourinho can be snatched from his path to Stamford Bridge. He has proved with the Porto side that meets Monaco in tomorrow's Champions League final that he can leave his stamp on a club and take it to trophy upon trophy. There is also a toughness about Mourinho that has left light bruising on Chelsea. He had no compunction about tweaking a billionaire's nose, wondering aloud if the club would flounder after Roman Abramovich got bored and began to withhold his money. The manager even claimed that Liverpool interest him more. The Anfield board, though, will not have been hyperventilating because they know that Mourinho might only have been putting Abramovich on notice that Chelsea will be run on his terms. It is quite likely that he has agreed to take over there after a finale with Porto tomorrow. Whoever does arrive at Anfield will face a very modern problem. After his good start there, Houllier was undone by the challenge of using huge sums. Fans fault the present team for its lack of craft, deploring the loss of technique once players like Gary McAllister, Patrik Berger and Robbie Fowler had gone. Houllier strove to address that but found the signings of El Hadji Diouf, Bruno Cheyrou and, to an extent, Harry Kewell had undermined his reputation. With a \u00a360m investment pending from Thaksin Shinawatra, Liverpool dared not stand by a man whose recent deals suggested he might squander it. Mourinho, like Curbishley and even Ben\u00edtez, has never dealt in such sums, but their relative lack of means has preserved them from transfer market follies like Houllier's. None of them will spurn Liverpool because of an excessive budget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
