The opening episode of The Tube (BBC2) painted a picture \u2013 mostly in the aforementioned bodily fluids \u2013 of the average Friday night on the subterranean network. Hogarth himself would run screaming from the sight, but the station managers, cleaners and assorted other underground sufferers of the British commitment to binge-drinking soldier \u2013 wryly, stoically, incredulously as the mood and temperament take them \u2013 on. \"Womit after womit,\" says one of the cleaners, a former professional cyclist who once, she told us, came second in the Soviet Union in the 25km race. \"Nobody apologise. Never, never, never.\" These now-staple scenes were interspersed with the endeavours of engineers to keep the carriages maintained and the workmen lifting and replacing an entire station's worth of track over the weekend \u2013 a tiny part of the \u00a310bn, 15-year plan to restore the 140km long tube system, now held together largely by string and spew after decades of underinvestment, to something like truly working order. David Roboso is in charge of it all. He has a gentle air and the haunted eyes of a man who has seen too much. You wanted to take him home, put him to bed, stroke his forehead and tell him that everything would be all right. One day. One day. Inevitably perhaps, given all the human interest stories unfolding elsewhere (from mooning morris dancers to the apparently random stabbing of a young woman at Leicester Square station, via the hundreds of weekend tourists standing baffled before Harry Beck's multicoloured cartographical masterpiece), the engineering interludes felt like longueurs. On the other hand, they didn't make you want to kill yourself and half of humanity at the same time, so it's swings and roundabouts, innit? All these behind-the-scenes shows are gradually taking on the air and function of public service films. In times gone by, we used to be told to use a handkerchief to trap germs, not to take more than \u00a35 abroad in notes until Britain had sorted out its balance of payments crises, or taught to clunk-click every trip. Now the weary message is: \"Stop coating every public surface and service in your excreta, could you? Look at the poor, poor people who have to clear it up.\" Panorama: Britain's Hidden Alcoholics (BBC1) focused on the few people in the country still keeping their drinking private. Alastair Campbell \u2013 a former hidden alcoholic himself, now a public recovering one \u2013 presented an examination of what was claimed to be the increasingly common problem of middle-class boozing. Campbell rounded up the usual causal suspects: the British discovery over the past few decades of wine (instead of good, hearty ale, which I think we are to gather never got you pissed, just inoculated against harsh winters and medieval poxes); the slackening of the licensing laws (\"I must admit,\" Campbell briefly glossed, \"the Labour government I worked for might have contributed to our current alcohol crisis\"); and his favourite scapegoat (so much easier than going back to that licensing laws question), the drink industry and advertising. But, bar a smidgen of anecdotal evidence from some paramedics and a trip to the Clouds House rehab centre (where, at \u00a312,000 per six-week course, middle-class professionals, however many they actually are, are going to end up disproportionately represented), the central thesis of the programme went unproven. There was no word on how or why the 2005 changes to the law, or the 30-year embrace of wine, should now be causing an epidemic in boozing among the middle classes, which made you wonder: is it hidden (more than other drinkers hide their habit), under-reported (perhaps because it provides fewer page-filling pictures of binge-drinking teenage girls teetering down the high street to their chlamydia-suffused doom) or simply on too small a scale to merit particular attention, outrage, pity, health initiatives or resources? That's not to deny its existence or the suffering occasioned by alcoholism, but without establishing his assertion, Campbell's programme came dangerously close to suggesting that because he had now become aware that drinking wasn't totally confined to the underclass, the problem Just Got Serious. Which does everyone involved, directly or indirectly, in dealing with alcoholism a great disservice. If you'll pardon the pun, it felt like a wasted half hour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
