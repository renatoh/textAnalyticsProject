While scientists and educationists have recently wasted a lot of time and energy engaging with a literal interpretation of the Old Testament, a more serious fault line in the schools system has been somewhat glossed over. It's the mainstream faiths - not the minority religious extremes - that divide headteachers. The latest findings of the Headspace survey of primary and secondary headteachers, carried out by Education Guardian and EdComs, and administered by ICM, shows that many heads are deeply concerned about the effects of faith schools on the education system. Of the 801 headteachers who replied to the questionnaire - of whom 28% actually work in religious schools - 47% felt there should be either fewer or no faith schools, while 32% felt there should be no change. Only 9% agreed with the government's policy of increasing the number of faith schools. \"There is a great deal more anxiety about a formal linking of religion to politics and education than there was 20 years ago,\" says Mick Brookes, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. \"Many people are concerned about faith schools propagating fundamentalism. I'm not sure their worries are wholly justified, but you can see how religion is a vehicle that can be misused. There's a big difference between learning about religion and promoting religiosity; the latter shouldn't be part of the education system.\" Part of the concern about faith schools has nothing to do with religion. Many headteachers have misgivings about the practicalities of admissions policies. Faith schools often achieve better results and, while the effects of discipline and ethos on pupil performance cannot be ignored, these schools rarely reflect the social composition of the communities in which they are located. Every neighbourhood with a well-performing faith school comes with its own stories of newly devout parents. And, if free school meals provide at least a rough guide to social deprivation, faith schools seem to get a disproportionately high percentage of their intake from the educated middle-classes in comparison to non-denominational community schools. \"No doubt most faith schools select their intake according to their admissions code,\" says John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \"But the system isn't so transparent that all doubt is removed. Many headteachers of non-faith schools believe religious schools have an adverse effect on their own admissions.\" Whatever headteachers feel, the chances of any government - let alone the present one that has nailed its colours firmly to the promotion of faith schools - formally dissolving links between religion and education are low. This is not, as some rightwing commentators have suggested, borne out of a politically correct nod to ethnic minorities. Rather, it is because no party dares to alienate the Anglican or Roman Catholic church. Bizarrely, at a time when church attendances are falling to their lowest ever levels, the influence of the church on government is at its strongest in decades. Unsurprisingly, some schools try to bypass the rules concerning religion. As part of the national curriculum, all schools are supposed to engage in \"a regular act of worship\", yet 12% admitted they ignored this - a figure that provoked a joint chorus from Brookes and Dunford of \"Are you sure 80% of the others weren't lying?\" \"It's partly a matter of logistics,\" says Brookes. \"A secondary school can't possibly get all its pupils into one place at the same time on a regular basis.\" But it's also a question of desirability. An act of worship that promoted one faith over others would be highly divisive in many areas, so most heads sensibly have assemblies that focus on community cohesion.\" Diversity or division? Heads in the survey fear the long-term consequences of a faith school policy. Only 25% believe the presence of schools with a religious character creates more religious tolerance in society; 18% reckon they make no difference, while 45% think they actively contribute to less tolerance. This is a potentially huge setback, both for the government, which has long argued that faith schools are key in building a multi-ethnic society, and for the schools themselves. The Church of England vigorously defends its record. \"If the results of this survey are to be believed,\" says David Whittington, acting chief education officer for the Church of England, \"it would put headteachers squarely against the general public, seven out of 10 of whom feel Church of England schools play a positive role in educating the nation's children. These schools are committed to being both Christian and inclusive - a commitment each and every school takes seriously, and is inspected upon. But the survey comes as no surprise to Keith Porteous Wood, director of the National Secular Society: \"There is a real philosophical problem here because diversity and cohesion are virtual antonyms. \"A great deal done in the name of multi-cultural diversity is being shown to have been a mistake. The more the government seeks to promote diversity through faith schools, the more divided society has become. You can't expect a faith school to do anything other than promote its own religion at the expense of all others. It's hardly going to say that every religion is pretty much the same and it doesn't matter what you believe. \"The implications of the policy are potentially disastrous. No matter what the government might say about a quota system in faith schools for non-believers, the fact is that once a school has committed itself to a religion, in many communities no one from any other religion or ethnic grouping will consider applying. So we are on the verge of starting an apartheid education system, which could be disastrous for race relations.\" Research on children's patterns of friendships in primary school, published this August by Irene Bruegel, professor of urban policy at London South Bank University, has endorsed many people's belief that non-faith schools are more effective in promoting religious and racial integration, but it has always been harder to prove that faith schools actively discriminate against certain sections of the community. Headspace shows categorically that some headteachers would be prepared to go that far - 17% of headteachers believe that church schools should be granted exemption - which they have already collectively applied for - from the new legislation preventing schools from teaching children that homosexual acts are sinful. Brookes is rather taken aback by this figure: \" Schools shouldn't be moral arbiters on this; homosexuality should neither be celebrated nor stigmatised. It should be seen for what it is - a fact of life.\" Despite all this, the government has no plans to review its policy on faith schools. \"We have a long tradition of faith schools in this country,\" says a DfES spokesperson. \"They are popular and can make an important contribution to community cohesion by promoting inclusion. \"We want to see faith schools working with other local schools to bring children of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds together, and to promote understanding between different sections of our society. Just last month, consensus was reached with all faith groups to place a new duty on school governing bodies to promote community cohesion and to ensure that Ofsted inspect schools on this.\" Opposition to academies Elsewhere in the Headspace survey, the DfES will be disappointed, given last week's announcement by the prime minister of the government's intention to expand the academy programme, that headteachers remain overwhelmingly opposed to this policy. Only 7% support it, while 44% are against it. These figures have remained almost constant throughout all five Headspace surveys, and nothing the teaching profession has said has ever caused the government to think twice on this issue. The survey also highlights how concerned many heads are about the demands placed on school boards and governors - 66% of headteachers believe the demands have become unacceptable and 77% think their governing body has either none, or only some, of the skills required to do their job. \"Insufficient attention has been paid by government to schools' rage on this issue,\" says Dunford. \"The job has changed out of all recognition over the past 10 years. What governors now need is specialist knowledge, but the main concern of the DfES seems to be having the right representative balance of the community.\" Coupled with this is the sense that many local authorities are leaving their schools to hang out to dry. Some 55% of headteachers think that their local authority is less effective in providing support to schools than it was five years ago, with 68% claiming they have taken on tasks that used to be performed by the LEA. \"This is an accurate reflection of what's going on,\" says Brookes, \"though it doesn't really explain why it's happening. It's clear that many more schools are now outsourcing services, such as human resources, personnel and building services, to private companies; and you can't blame them for doing so if the authority can't offer a good service at a competitive price. \"But the local authorities are themselves being put in a difficult position by central government, which has been squeezing them for cash in recent budgets. This doesn't just mean they have less to spend on services; it encourages schools to think that education is a low priority for the authority and to look elsewhere for services. We believe this is part of a deliberate move by the DfES to weaken the links between local authorities and schools, because it becomes far easier for the government to force through its academy and trust school programme.\" With the publication of the primary league tables later this week, many heads are anxious about their school's ranking. Few would object to a table that accurately reflected the work they did, but no one seems to believe that the current tables are a true picture of anything but the class and educational background of their pupils. Although the DfES insists the league tables do take social deprivation into account, through the value-added score, 63% of headteachers think the main way this is assessed - the free school meals indicator - is unfair. As a result, only 13% believe the value-added score is the most accurate measure of a school's performance. \"We have known for a long time that the government's league tables are, at best, a blunt instrument,\" says Dunford. \"We now have far more accurate ways of measuring deprivation based on post-code analysis. If the DfES is committed to publishing league tables, it should, at least, be using these alternative tables that already exist.\" Extended schools One issue on which the government might decide to review how its policy is implemented is extended schools. When the initiative was first put forward, there was widespread support; this is now slipping away rapidly, with 50% of headteachers opposed to them. \"Heads are beginning to think more carefully about the rhetoric of turning every school into an extended school,\" says Brookes. \"Some are concerned about budgets and governance, but most are worried about duplicating services. If there are good children's services in the community, it makes far more sense for a school to steer parents in that direction than to set up an alternative.\" Put together, all this adds up to a potential headache. For while the government seems happy to put its faith in religious schools, headteachers appear to be losing their faith in the government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
