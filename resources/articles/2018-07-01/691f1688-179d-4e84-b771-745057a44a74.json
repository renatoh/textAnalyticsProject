In a midnight announcement, the Department of Agriculture said it had suspended a second live export licence, after a reshuffle of directors in the Emanuel Exports group of companies attempted to sidestep the first suspension. In June the department suspended the licence of Emanuel Exports, the company that stocked the Awassi Express which lost 2,400 sheep due to heat stress in 2017, pending a review into a separate incident. On Tuesday the department confirmed that EMS Rural Exports, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emanuel Exports, had notified it of its intention to export the 60,000 sheep stranded in a feedlot in Perth using a separate licence. Under Australian export rules, if an export licence is disqualified, other licences held by the same person are also rendered inoperable. In an attempt to use EMS Rural Exports\u2019 licence to export the sheep, Emanuel Exports and the subsidiary had updated their directors, removing 70-year-old Graham Daws and appointing his son, Nicholas, as director and company secretary. The department said the fresh suspension \u201cwill remain in place pending a full review\u201d but it was not appropriate to provide further information while the investigation is ongoing. \u201cSheep that had been due for export remain in a registered feedlot,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe sheep have been inspected by the department\u2019s veterinarians; they are in good health and well-cared for. \u201cArrangements for these animals remain the responsibility of the exporter. \u201cExporters are also responsible for ensuring they meet all animal welfare requirements imposed under commonwealth and state law.\u201d On Tuesday the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, had said he had \u201cno power\u201d to interfere in the operations of the independent regulator. Emanuel is under criminal investigation, and two departmental investigations, into the company and the Awassi voyage after allegations of overstocking, failing to have sufficient food and water available, animal injury and illness not being treated, and accredited vets and stockmen leaving vessels prior to unloading. The controversies surrounding live exports \u2013 particularly footage of the Awassi voyage \u2013 has prompted the Turnbull government to propose tougher penalties for directors who breach licence conditions and improved animal welfare measures including reducing stocking density by 28%. However, the government decided against a ban on live exports. The Liberal MP Sussan Ley, with backing from colleagues Sarah Henderson and Jason Wood, has introduced a private members bill to ban live sheep exports in the northern summer from next year and, in five years, totally ban the transport of sheep and lambs to the Middle East or to any routes through the Persian Gulf or Red Sea. Animals Australia say they\u2019re relieved by the decision after earlier threatening to stop the export with federal court action. \u201cThe possibility of these sheep being exported by an affiliate of suspended exporter Emanuel Exports, has had both the public and politicians shaking their heads in dismay and disbelief,\u201d Animals Australia\u2019s Lyn White said. Guardian Australia has contacted the Australian Live Exporters\u2019 Council and Emanuel Exports for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
