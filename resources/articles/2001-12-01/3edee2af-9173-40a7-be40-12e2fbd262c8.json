England had yet to hear even the twang of an Aussie accent. The summer had begun with a mood of optimism unequalled in modern times. Here finally, under Hussain's leadership and Duncan Fletcher's coaching, were a team worthy not only of competing with the best but of beating them too. Pakistan had been beaten in their own country before Christmas 2000 and Sri Lanka as well in the new year with an inspirational comeback from a Test down. The self-belief within the team was boundless. Darren Gough and Andy Caddick then took 16 wickets between them as Pakistan, once more, were swept away by an innings at Lord's in the first Test of the summer. England, it seemed, could do no wrong. Though Hussain strove to rein in the bring-on-the-Australians bandwagon that was gathering pace, a fifth successive series win was on the cards. All it required was a draw in the second Test at Old Trafford. Or, better still, a win. From the wettest, most miserable spring in years, Peter Marron, the Old Trafford groundsman, had conjured a majestic Test pitch, on which Pakistan managed 403. England's response was initially worrying as Marcus Trescothick and Mike Atherton fell in successive overs to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. It was to be Pakistan's last success for more than a day as Thorpe and Michael Vaughan, with a century apiece, compiled a third-wicket partnership of 267. The pitch was immaculate, the batting dominant and the confidence overwhelming. At 282 for two, England were in complete command of their destiny. Something was happening, however. Their running between the wickets had been memorable: calculated, professional and occasionally, when knowing their fielder, cruel. Gradually, however, confidence turned to arrogance, sound judgment to recklessness. They began to take the mickey and paid the price. Thorpe was run out by Wasim and it set in motion a chain of events that culminated at the end of the summer with Steve Waugh holding on to the Ashes trophy after yet another series in which England had failed to compete at the required sustained level. Immediately Thorpe was gone, so was Vaughan, and then in rapid succession the rest of the side, the last five for only nine runs as Alec Stewart, leading the side as the injured Hussain watched from the dressing room, sat on his bat at the non-striker's end unable to exert any influence. A potential match-winning lead had turned into a 46-run deficit and the cracks had appeared. Meanwhile the Australians had arrived, after their pilgrimage to Gallipoli, and had travelled to Worcester for practice and their first game. They had heard much of the new England, not least while in India when they were losing an incredible tussle at the same time as Sri Lanka were being overcome, and were looking forward to a hard-fought, competitive series. Now there was something else to attract their attention. Two years previously, at Hobart's Bellerive Oval, likewise against Pakistan, they had chased and achieved a target of 369, the third-highest winning total ever made. Here, Pakistan's furious second innings of 323 left England 370 to win - one run more, in a full day plus 20 overs and on a pitch still playing brilliantly. A draw should not be difficult but there was a statement to be made, a gauntlet to be thrown down to Australia, and on the evening of the fourth day Trescothick and Atherton went some of the way by scoring 85 without being parted. The final day had repercussions that went far beyond the match itself. By now Australia had left Worcester and were at Lord's for practice and pre- series press conferences. They were also following the Test with a keen interest. At lunch England had continued their progress, reaching 149 for the single loss, shortly before the interval, of Atherton. It had been more sedate but the target, 221 now from 61 overs, was well in hand. But then they lost their way. Waqar's bowling was an inspiration and, as captain, he decided to put pressure on England's aspirations by setting his fields deep and placing the imperative on the batsmen to break out. If that seemed odd for a captain who needed a win to save the series then Pakistan are past masters at sitting back, waiting for an opening and then going for the jugular. While Wasim turned Vaughan inside out with his swing, Saqlain Mushtaq tied up the other end. Trescothick reached his century but the impetus had gone. Only one further wicket was lost but only 47 runs came from the 29 overs of the penultimate session and only 111 from 58 in the day thus far. England had been caught on the horns of a dilemma. \"At the time,\" recalled the Australia coach John Buchanan, \"I thought England were protecting a 1-0 series win and they let Pakistan in with a chance of winning which they took.\" In the final session England were blown away, their pretence at matching the Australian approach to chasing a target long since gone and the manner of their subsequent defeat a matter of regret, for it told its story to the Australians of a side who even now were not prepared to take a risk in the pursuit of glory. On that last day they had also lost some respect. The second new ball accounted for Thorpe and Trescothick, and Saqlain began the process of picking off the rest of the innings in a spell that was to bring him four for five in a 36-ball period. It was all brought to an end by Imran Nazir's spectacular catch at cover. England had lost eight wickets for 60 in that final session and with it the match. The Australians had been preparing for a function at their high commission and listened to the clatter of wickets on the team coach. It left them buoyant. \"I thought it was going to be a hard, tough series,\" Steve Waugh said recently. \"They were unbeaten in five series, including two on the subcontinent, so it had shaped up for a tough assignment for us. \"I think England's loss at Old Trafford set the tone for the whole summer. If they'd won they would have been buoyant and it would have done wonders for their chances in their own minds. In contrast, losing created self-doubt and that coupled with our confidence and self-belief gave us an edge which we built upon as the summer went on.\" England, they understood, might indeed have changed but not enough, and that evening's reception was an animated affair. In that one match they had recognised that England's chances of retrieving the Ashes had receded into the distance.
