I recently took a trip to Sheffield from my home in York. My plan was to travel by train and cycle at each end. Tickets purchased, I tweeted CrossCountry for a bike reservation, adding that I\u2019m unable to use a vertical hanging hook and asking whether alternative storage would be available. The answer was no. As a follow-up came the unexpectedly hostile: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find a way of hanging it up yourself, or seek help in doing so. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t come onboard.\u201d In theory, vertical storage allows for two bicycles to be stored upright, tucked into a narrow cupboard, front wheels hung on ceiling hooks. The space is minimal, allowing train operators to claim cycle storage is provided, whilse stretching the technical definition to its absolute limit. The fact so few bicycles are narrow or light enough to fit into this crevice seems of minor concern to the rail companies. That still fewer people are physically capable of wrestling them in appears of even less interest. But in choosing to provide vertical storage as the only option, these companies have made a decision that disproportionately puts female cyclists and those with mobility issues at a huge disadvantage. It may not have been a deliberate choice but this, nonetheless, is the end result. Women are on average shorter and have less upper body strength than men: anything requiring a heavy object to be hoisted six foot in the air is intended for use by the average (fit, non-disabled) man, and not the average person. Cycling is my primary mode of transportation, but with weakness in both wrists, I can\u2019t lift my bike without support. As a newly single woman on an independence kick, it was quite an indignity to feel I required male assistance in order to assert said independence. Cue my impotent rage, to which CrossCountry responded that it hears \u201cvery few complaints along these lines\u201d. Which was interesting, because the company and I then received a barrage of tweets from all manner of passengers facing this very issue. CrossCountry is not the only rail company to install this parody of cycle storage. ScotRail, Great Western, Virgin and others have all introduced it and the rest are following suit. Each of LNER\u2019s new, much-touted Azuma trains have four hooks in two cupboards, which the operator describes as \u201cplenty of bike storage\u201d. With greater passenger numbers and pressure from above to increase capacity still further, something\u2019s got to give, and that something is adequate, accessible cycle storage. But in order to tackle the climate crisis and encourage sustainable journeys, we need to make the natural combination of rail and cycle an easy, accessible option for everyone who could be cycling, and not simply those who currently do. The UK\u2019s gender split of cyclists is heavily skewed towards men, with our infrastructure fundamentally unattractive to women. It\u2019s ironic, given the bicycle was once a historical symbol of female empowerment and independence. Engineers and CEOs don\u2019t actively calculate how best to exclude women, but they don\u2019t work out how to encourage them. If female cyclists \u2013 particularly those traveling alone \u2013 find it harder to load their bicycles on to trains then many simply won\u2019t bother cycling at all. Some won\u2019t make the journey. Others will drive instead. The same can be said for disabled cyclists. Many disabled and elderly people find it easier to cycle than walk, but provision such as this makes no allowance for handbikes, trikes, recumbents or e-bikes. CrossCountry\u2019s cycle policy states: \u201cAs space is limited, we are unable to convey tandems, tricycles \u2026 or motorised bikes on any of our trains.\u201d No exceptions are mentioned. Let\u2019s be clear: vertical cycle storage is a disaster for everybody. It carries fewer bikes, allows for limited styles and sizes, is a struggle for even the most capable, stops families travelling together and actively discourages sustainable journeys. Through my involvement with the York Cycle Campaign, I\u2019m aware of how many engineers, cycling bodies, individuals and organisations warned the rail companies against it. Every cyclist I\u2019ve heard from considers it either a hindrance or a flat-out barrier. Nonetheless, as ever, it\u2019s the marginalised groups who suffer the most. My plan is to write to ministers at relevant government departments to see what they have to say. Peter Walker adds: After seeing Robyn\u2019s tweets, I asked on Twitter about other people\u2019s experiences, and the response was overwhelming. Wherever vertical cycle storage is in place, people said, the cupboards are either far too small for many bikes, difficult for people to hang their bikes in, or full of rubbish, baggage or both. Here are a few examples. I also sought responses from the three rail companies that came up most often: CrossCountry, which runs long-distance services around the UK; GWR, which operates to Wales, and the west and south-west of England; and LNER, which operates the main East Coast franchise. I particularly sought information on what work they had done to ensure vertical bike storage was accessible. The responses were long, and mixed \u2013 extracts of them are below. But the key seemed to be this: most companies said they receive few complaints. Perhaps UK cyclists are inured to awful treatment on trains? But perhaps that\u2019s the lesson \u2013 don\u2019t just mention it on Twitter, let the rail company know. The main rationale given is quite depressing. Rail services are busy, space is limited, and vertical is the best way to fulfil the contractual obligation to carry some bikes without taking up much room. But here are edited extracts of what they had to say: CrossCountry The company says it is \u201cfully compliant with the committed obligations\u201d to carry bikes, and on carrying disabled people. It went on: As more and more people choose rail as their preferred mode of transport, managing the finite interior space on trains becomes even more important to support all types of customer. This increase in demand for seats and luggage means vertical bike storage offers the best solution for the limited space we have available. We introduced vertical storage on our trains over 10 years ago and this is now common on Britain\u2019s railways, including on the latest high speed long-distance trains currently being introduced with other train operators. Ensuring our services are inclusive for all our customers, including cyclists, is something we keep under constant review. However, with only 12 months remaining, there is no opportunity to change the design of cycling provision in our current franchise. Although not a huge issue in terms of customer feedback, with only 13 contacts regarding the storage of cycles over the past year, we would be happy to raise this in our ongoing dialogue with the Department for Transport on options for the future of CrossCountry. GWR We recognise that some customers preferred the storage for bikes in the separate guard\u2019s van on our older trains. However, we had to find space for cycles on the train, while improving space for customers and luggage without cycles. The guard\u2019s van was not ideal either \u2013 it meant cyclists had to walk to the very end or very front of the train to store their bikes, go and find their seat and then head all the way back when they wanted to depart. It also meant an added risk of delay as it could be difficult for customers to get to the end of the train within the scheduled times. The guard\u2019s van also took up the space of about 80 standard class seats on every train \u2013 an important consideration given the increasing passenger numbers on the rail network. We are fully supportive of encouraging greener travel \u2013 bikes are welcome on our trains, and of course every additional non-cycling customer we carry is a potential journey not made by road. We are investing in improved cycle parking facilities at various stations across GWR and cycle hire services are available at a number of locations too. The hook system has been designed to Department for Transport standards, thoroughly tested, and other train operators have also been using the same setup for some time. Listening to customer feedback, at GWR we do however accept that in practice there have been occasions when the dedicated cycle space is used by other customers to store their luggage, and we are working with Hitachi to further improve onboard signage. LNER As we introduce new Azuma trains across our network, collecting feedback from our customers is as important as ever. LNER is currently gathering feedback from customers travelling with bikes to help us understand how we can make improvements. We\u2019ll be reviewing this with our engineering team to identify where improvements can be made. Any customers who require extra help as part of their journey with us can book assistance on the LNER website."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
