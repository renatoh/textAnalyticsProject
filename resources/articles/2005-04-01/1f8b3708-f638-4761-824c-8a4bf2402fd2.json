The Typhoon, made by BAE Systems, the European defence group Eads and Italy's Alenia, had hoped to win the Singaporean order to add to its only guaranteed export business - an Austrian order for 18 jets. The Eurofighter consortium, based near Munich, and BAE was unable to comment yesterday because of confidentiality clauses imposed by Singapore but it is understood that Boeing's F-15 and Dassault's Rafale remain the only two left in the competition. According to Jane's Defence Weekly, questions of price and capability within the timeframe held the key to grounding Eurofighter's bid. The consortium had flown out two jets last June to try to win the order. The Typhoon project has been sharply criticised by MPs because of cost and time overruns and by others as an unnecessary relic of the cold war. There are serious doubts whether the full order for 636 planes for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain will be met. The UK is taking 55 of the first tranche of 148 jets to be delivered and has agreed to take a further 89 under the contract, signed by ministers last December, for 236 in the second tranche. The third tranche, with Britain taking 88 of the last 236, may never happen. It is also understood that the Eurofighter consortium has increased worries that the Greek government will never fulfil an initial contract for 60 Typhoons, with the option to buy a further 30, because of the country's budgetary crisis. Last year Greece staged the costly Olympics and revised its borrowing figures for the previous three years, running up a deficit of 6% of its GDP. The Singaporean decision, which could be appealed against, is a fresh blow to the European industry following the recent success of Boeing in winning orders for its new 787 Dreamliner civilian jet and the failure so far of Airbus to meet its target of 50 orders for its rival A350 by the end of June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
