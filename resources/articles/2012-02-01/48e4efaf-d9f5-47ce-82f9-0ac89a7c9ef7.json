Their recording of Francesca da Rimini is certainly up there with classic versions by the likes of Bernstein and Stokowski, and even steals a march on them at times thanks to the erotic frankness Nelsons brings to the central love scene. Rather than unleashing pure frenzy from the outset, he builds gradually into the depiction of Dante's Inferno, and the tension he achieves by the end is little short of staggering. His performance of the Fourth, however, is altogether more reflective. This is not so much a battle with fate, as an expression of nostalgia on the part of one already crushed by it, until Nelsons' unusually upbeat account of the finale eventually sweeps prevailing sadness away. Not everyone will like it. Francesca, though, is essential listening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
