The banner headline 'Hamilton and wife in rape quiz' screamed out from the front of every tabloid newspaper following the couple's arrest and interrogation by the police on Friday evening. Speaking yesterday, Christine Hamilton dismissed the allegation that the couple had taken part in a rape and indecent assault on a woman at a flat in Ilford as 'nonsense on stilts'. She told the Radio 4 Today programme: 'It's mind boggling that it's got this far. I have never met this woman. Absolutely never. I've never been to Ilford where it is alleged to have taken place.' Her husband added: 'We deny this fabrication absolutely categorically.' The chain of events began on 3 May at the plush Bond Street offices of renowned publicist Max Clifford. He was visited by a woman who made a number of allegations about Christine and Neil Hamilton. The allegations were of a sexual nature but did not involve any crime. The woman's intention was to sell her story to a Sunday tabloid newspaper. 'People come to me all the time,' Clifford said yesterday. 'It happens on a daily basis. On this occasion I did what I always do - asked her whether she had any way to prove the allegations that she was making.' In a bid to gather more evidence the woman, of her own accord, allegedly met with the Hamiltons soon after her meeting with Clifford. It was on this occasion that the alleged sexual assault took place. 'Soon after, she phoned to tell me what had happened to her. I told her that she should report it to the police and that is what she did. The one thing to make clear is that I am not alleging anything, these allegations are not coming from me. I have no personal grudge against the Hamiltons; I have always found them most amusing.' As part of their three-month investigation, police are understood to have examined tape recordings obtained by the woman along with material downloaded from the internet and messages purported to come from Christine Hamilton. On Friday, police searched the couple's Cheshire home and London flat and removed a number of computers for forensic examination. A man who was also alleged to have been involved in the attack was arrested and interviewed six weeks ago. He has not been charged but was bailed pending further inquiries. Following the interview, the couple issued a highly graphic statement through their lawyer, Michael Coleman, which detailed the allegations against the couple: 'An accusation has been made against them that they took part in a rape and indecent assault in Ilford on Saturday May 4. The details of that allegation are quite horrific and I think it is appropriate for you to know of the allegation. It has been said that Mr and Mrs Hamilton were in a flat in Ilford when a young woman was raped.' The statement went on to give explicit details of lewd sexual behaviour that the Hamiltons allegedly engaged in while the woman was raped. The statement continued that 'those allegations have been denied absolutely by Mr and Mrs Hamilton. They have co-operated entirely with the police and have supplied the police with details and information as to where they were that day. They have also given the police total access to all their private affairs, their telephone records, their credit card records and such like in order that the police can fully investigate this allegation which has been made against them. 'One point which came out dur ing the course of their interviews which is probably appropriate for you to know is that the police raised the name Max Clifford. The purpose of the police raising that name we do not know but it is a matter obviously that the police may wish to enlarge upon. No charges have been made against any person and certainly no charges have been made against either Mr or Mrs Hamilton.' Soon afterwards Christine, 51, said the involvement of Max Clifford, a publicist employed by the Hamiltons' enemy, Harrods store boss Mohamed al Fayed, undermined the allegations 'The whole thing is an absolute monstrous fabrication and a lie, and the fact that Max Clifford's name has been put to us by the police is of absolutely no surprise whatsoever,' she said. But Fayed denied yesterday the suggestions that he had any involvement with any attempt to smear the Hamiltons. The Hamiltons released their statement to prevent such details being leaked to the press. 'Rather than wait for the woman's witness statement to be leaked, they decided to take the initiative and get it out of the way,' said a source close to the couple. Rumours of the police inquiry have been circulating among tabloid newspapers for some weeks. At least one Sunday title has been making discreet inquiries into the backgrounds of those said to be involved. Last night Hamilton said he had no plans to issue any further statements to the press and would be remaining inside his Battersea flat for the remainder of the evening. Outside the plush apartment which overlooks Battersea Park, a large group of reporters and cameramen waited impatiently. A police spokesman said the couple had been bailed to return to Barkingside police station but would not say when. He declined to give any further details. Hamilton, once a political high-flyer, resigned as a trade Minister in October 1994 after the Guardian accused him of accepting money from Fayed in return for asking questions in parliament. He lost his seat in the 1997 general election to former BBC reporter Martin Bell. In May Hamilton was declared bankrupt. He currently owes Fayed around \u00a31.5 million."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
