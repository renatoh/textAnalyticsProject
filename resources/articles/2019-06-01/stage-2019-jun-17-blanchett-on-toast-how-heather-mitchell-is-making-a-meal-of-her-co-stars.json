And if they are a family, opening night is like Christmas Day. It\u2019s full of excitement, nerves, the possibility of everything going wrong, and of course the giving of gifts. Opening night nerves are often forgotten momentarily as actors, directors and writers run around the city finding the right present for their co-star, and scribble message after message on an endless procession of opening night cards. Brendan Cowell and Heather Mitchell in Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s True West Some people\u2019s gifts are better than others, but in the Australian stage world there is one woman who is widely acknowledged to be the queen: Heather Mitchell, legendary actor of stage (The Harp in the South, Still Point Turning) and screen (Muriel\u2019s Wedding, The Great Gatsby). (Heather wasn\u2019t even in my recent play The Appleton Ladies\u2019 Potato Race, but on opening night she was there with a potato masher and a personalised card for every creative in our company.) For years now, Heather has been doing something particularly thoughtful and skilled for the plays she performs in. It started in 2010, when she was being directed by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s production of Sam Shepherd\u2019s True West. Heather Mitchell drawing on a piece of toast using Vegemite \u201cThe play is about shattered American dreams; and in the final act of the play, Austin, Brendan Cowell\u2019s character, steals 30 toasters from neighbouring households and litters the kitchen with toast. It was like a demolition site,\u201d Mitchell tells Guardian Australia. \u201cAfter every show the stage manager would dutifully sweep up the remnants and then pile broken and burnt toast into bins. Some pieces trampled and some still intact.\u201d One night Mitchell was asked to look after the twin daughters of her co-star, actor Alan Dukes. \u201cAfter playing with makeup, I spied a bag of the discarded toast. We spent the next hour painting the toast with brushes made from disposable chopsticks and watered-down Vegemite. On closing night I framed four toasts. One for each of the cast and one for Philip. That\u2019s where it started.\u201d (L-R) Anita Hegh and Rose Riley with their toast artworks Since then Mitchell has made the toast for many of the productions she has appeared in \u2013 and the toasts themselves have become quite the industry treasure. Actor Sam Neill is the proud recipient of a toast, after working with Mitchell recently on the film Palm Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you can say, hand on heart, that your friend\u2019s art is good enough to eat,\u201d he says. \u201cMind you it depends whose portrait you\u2019re talking about. Eating Bryan Brown or Hugo Weaving \u2013 the stomach turns at the very idea. I love Heather\u2019s quirky, eerily accurate portraits.\u201d Eerily accurate they are: there\u2019s Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving forever remembered in toast as Hedda Gabler and Judge Brack. Sarah Snook stares proudly from sourdough as Saint Joan. The casts of Summer Rain, The Harp in the South and The Secret River are remembered in painstaking detail. Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett, who appeared together in a 2006 Sydney Theatre Company production of Hedda Gabler For the first time, Mitchell is offering up these little treasures of Australian theatrical history to the highest bidder, raising money for the Sydney Theatre Company. Still, they\u2019re toast. Aren\u2019t they ephemeral in the extreme? Mitchell has been long experimenting with the lifespan of her mini artworks. \u201cEach toast varies in success and the time it takes to make. Sourdough is hardy, gluten-free tends to burn, brioche can be temperamental, focaccia too holey, ciabatta cracks, naan too brittle, challah too soft. Baguettes are downright temperamental and rye is simply out of the question,\u201d she says. \u201cThe longevity of a toast\u2019s life has been trial and error. The greater the sugar content the longer the life. The absence of moisture and air also helps. Toasts from eight years ago are still going strong, however some have cracked \u2013 and one gave birth to a family of moths. \u201cThe toasts I make now have been preserved in a solution and fixative so although there is no guarantee of lasting a lifetime in their current state, they should survive intact many, many years if not dropped.\u201d Scenes from the 2018 Sydney Theatre Company production of The Harp in the South Heather\u2019s toast art has fans all over Australia \u2013 and the world. Academy Award nominee Richard E Grant, who appears with Mitchell in Palm Beach, told Guardian Australia via email he\u2019s \u201chonoured to have a \u2018toast\u2019 portrait by my fabulous \u2018onscreen wife\u2019. It\u2019s hanging on the wall of my study and a reminder of what a great time we had working together. Heather is a true artist.\u201d Actor Helen Thomson, who starred alongside Mitchell in the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s production of The Harp in the South, says: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted my own toast (because they are legendary these days), and now I have one of me as Delie Stock the brothel owner and crime boss of Surry Hills, leaning on a post, smoking a cigarette and eyeing her domain. I will love it forever.\u201d (L-R) Ursula Yovich (who was in 2016\u2019s The Golden Age) and Sarah Snook (Saint Joan, 2018) For the exhibition, Mitchell has created 30 new toasts, paying tribute to Philip Seymour Hoffmann and the Sydney Theatre Company. There\u2019s one major difference between the toasts made on that first night nine years ago \u2013 one that might not be all that popular with actors who like a mid-show snack. \u201cI have opted for paint now which means they can no longer be eaten in an emergency.\u201d \u2022 Heather Mitchell has created 30 new toasts which will be exhibited and auctioned at a Sydney Theatre Company fundraiser at the Cell Block Theatre, National Art School in Sydney on 22 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
