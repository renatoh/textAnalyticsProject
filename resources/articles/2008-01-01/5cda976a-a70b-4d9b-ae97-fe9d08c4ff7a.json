Venezuelan military helicopters bearing the Red Cross insignia sat for a third day in Villavicencio, a small town on the edge of Colombia's vast eastern jungles where the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as Farc, holds sway. They waited in vain for the guerrillas to tell them where to fly to inside the rebel-controlled zone to pick up the hostages. The mission is being watched by Latin American leaders, the US, France and other countries with citizens among the 3,000 hostages being held by Farc. They hope that the championing by Ch\u00e1vez - the Venezuelan president - of a political solution involving the exchange of hostages for jailed guerrillas could open the door to further releases. A group of 10 international observers from Latin America, France and Switzerland included the unlikely late addition of Stone, a Hollywood director, who was invited to join the rescue mission only a week ago when he met Ch\u00e1vez in Caracas. Ch\u00e1vez quipped that Stone was George Bush's emissary to the operation; Stone in return called Mr Ch\u00e1vez a \"great man\". The two flew together to Colombia at the weekend on the presidential jet. In an interview from Villavicencio with Associated Press, Stone said he had no illusions about Farc, \"but it looks like they are a peasant army fighting for a decent living. And here, if you fight, you fight to win.\" Stone has been forbidden to leave his hotel room on the grounds that it would expose him to the risk of being taken hostage himself - Villavicencio is riven with drug gangs and rightwing death squads. \"This release could be a new start, a break in the ice. The important thing is that we build momentum so everyone can be released,\" Stone said. The film-maker is one of two Hollywood directors preparing works on Pablo Escobar, the cocaine baron who waged war with the Colombian state until he was killed in 1993. He is also filming a documentary about relations between the US and its Latin American irritants such as Ch\u00e1vez and Fidel Castro of Cuba. As he boarded the helicopter on route for Colombia, Stone said that if he had the chance he would ask the Farc rebels one question: \"Why are you holding on to these 3,000 people? These are not military hostages, these are civilians. Give them a break - let them out.\" Two of the three hostages awaiting release, Colombian politicians Consuelo Gonz\u00e1lez de Perdomo and Clara Rojas, have been held for six years. The third is Rojas's son, Emmanuel, who was born in the jungle and is believed to be four. The story of the child fathered by a guerrilla and brought up inside the rebel zone has horrified and fascinated the Colombian media. Rojas was kidnapped in 2002 while campaigning for the post of Colombian vice-president alongside the French-Colombian citizen Ingrid Betancourt who was also taken and is still a captive. The release operation is at a critical stage, not only for the hostages but also politically. The Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, has taken a strong line with the rebel movement, using US funds to help pursuing them deep into the jungle, and refusing to negotiate. Officially, he broke off cooperation with the release initiative launched by Ch\u00e1vez last month but has grudgingly granted permission for the Venezuelan helicopters to fly deep into Colombian airspace. The Ch\u00e1vez initiative has focused on 44 heavily publicised hostage cases involving high-profile and foreign captives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
