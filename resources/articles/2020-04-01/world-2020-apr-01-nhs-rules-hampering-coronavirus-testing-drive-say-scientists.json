Procedures drawn up by Public Health England describe the precise chemicals and equipment that must be used to test patients. But with specific reagents in short supply, senior researchers told the Guardian that the UK must find alternatives to avoid more delays, with one arguing: \u201cThese are not normal times.\u201d Their plea came as the prime minister was forced to address mounting anger about the government\u2019s failure to increase testing, just weeks after it had appeared to rule out such a strategy. Ministers have been consistently flummoxed by questions on the issue. In a video message posted on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Boris Johnson said the country need to \u201cmassively ramp up\u201d the two separate tests that show whether people have, or have had, the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial people who do have the disease are able to be tested positive and to take the necessary steps to isolate at home in the way that I am doing and many, many others are doing,\u201d he said. The UK\u2019s poor testing figures compared with other nations have caused a huge political backlash, with critics asking why the government is both failing to source the right equipment and refusing to agree to expand testing to the general population. Only around 8,000 hospital patients and NHS staff are being tested daily \u2013 well short of the government\u2019s targets and far below the 70,000 a day achieved in Germany. In total, just 2,000 NHS workers \u2013 or 0.4% of those being exposed to the virus \u2013 have been tested so far, meaning thousands in isolation cannot get back to work. Ministers have struggled for four days in a row at No 10\u2019s daily press conference to explain why testing is so slow. In an attempt to solve another logistical barrier, NHS England also directed all trusts to lift the 15% cap on staff testing and use all their spare testing capacity to help solve the problem. But Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, said that efforts to scale up testing were being frustrated by over-reliance on specified reagents, enzymes and other chemicals. \u201cIt is holding things up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that\u2019s got to be a good thing. \u201cThe NHS have very specific requirements and there is good reason for that. It makes sure that standards are maintained. But there are alternatives. They need to be optimised and validated, but you can fast-track that if you have enough people. It wouldn\u2019t take a lot of time.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced last week that the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests. But the Guardian understands the UK has actually put in orders for up to 40m. Dr Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the non-profit Geneva-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, a WHO collaboration centre, told the Guardian presidents and prime ministers were trying to outbid each other to secure testing kits. \u201cIn all countries we have prime ministers calling the CEOs and diagnostic companies to try to get hold of the stocks,\u201d she said. \u201cIndonesia and Peru we know have offered to order several million tests and send private planes to pick the tests up. There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies.\u201d Universities have received a flurry of urgent calls from the government to assist in scaling up virus testing. Weeks ago, certain enzymes were in short supply. More recently, requests came in for chemicals that release the virus\u2019s genetic code, the first step in the process of detecting the virus in swab samples. \u201cThe protocols say they want specific types of reagent for that, but there are lots of ways to do it, there are many reagents you can use,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cWe can do this, and with appropriate controls, the risks are low and the benefits could be high.\u201d The stringent rules around test chemicals and equipment are designed to ensure that tests are reliable and consistent across the NHS. The health service benefits because it can order in bulk from a single supplier at a preferential rate. But the procedures are so prescriptive that all laboratories can end up using the same equipment, suppliers and chemicals, so when demand spikes, there are no other approved products to use. \u201cOn a normal day, this works,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cBut these are not normal times. At the moment we need to ramp up testing. \u201cResearch labs, which tend to operate in a much less regimented manner, have the skills, equipment and quite possibly sufficient reagents to contribute to this effort,\u201d she went on. \u201cThey won\u2019t be exactly the same items that Public Health England use, but they will work just as well. Research labs are also very used to working to validate their data across labs to ensure their data are comparable to that of their colleagues.\u201d The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, BIVDA, said the problem was a shortage of reagent kits in the global supply chain. While manufacturers are producing the kits as rapidly as they can, the firms are having to prioritise what products are shipped where. Stonehouse said chemicals were not the only hurdle that scientists faced in trying to help in the acceleration of testing. A large swath of university-trained researchers have volunteered to run testing equipment, but have been held up amid legal concerns about having them working at NHS and other testing facilities. \u201cThis seems to be stopping things going forwards,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s an overreaction. We have staff in ITU who have not worked in intensive care before because we need them there. We need that flexibility on testing.\u201d Labour called on Wednesday for Boris Johnson to publish a clear \u201cnational testing strategy\u201d that sets out exactly how the government plans to expand its programme in the coming weeks. As well as coming under fire over the logistical problems, No 10 and its advisers are facing questions about why they are refusing to commit to a future strategy of mass testing of the general population as well as of NHS workers and patients in hospitals. Public health experts have warned that mass testing for live cases of the virus is essential if the UK wants to ease the lockdown, arguing that it will be necessary to find any new hotspots and suppress them using aggressive quarantining and contact tracing methods. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, told the Guardian: \u201cThe government claims to have abandoned its herd immunity strategy, but without clear testing, many are asking what our strategy actually is.\u201d Alok Sharma, the business secretary, was the latest minister to decline to confirm that moving to mass testing was part of the agenda as he appeared at the No 10 press conference on Wednesday, with Boris Johnson still in isolation. Public Health England has repeatedly emphasised that wider testing to see who is immune is a greater priority, but this does not find people who are currently infectious. Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, said on Wednesday that the government wanted testing to go \u201cfrom the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands\u201d, although the intended split between tests for live cases of the virus and immunity is not clear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
