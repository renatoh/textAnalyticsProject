Three men incarcerated at the Winn correctional center in a remote part of Louisiana told the Guardian that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has isolated 44 of them together after they were possibly exposed to coronavirus. Some of the detainees are so desperate to leave that they are seeking voluntary deportation. They say their cries for masks, hand sanitizer, gloves and cleaning supplies have gone ignored, including for elderly detainees and those with asthma. In a series of phone calls, the men described a nightmare ordeal over the last two weeks, citing rampant mistreatment and a terrifying lack of information from Ice after they learned they were under some kind of quarantine. They also said that seven of their fellow detainees were deported on a flight to Colombia this week, four days into a 14-day quarantine period, which would appear to violate basic standards of coronavirus containment. Their firsthand accounts escalate concerns that human rights lawyers have been raising for weeks, that Ice jails could become death traps during the pandemic and that the only way to save lives and slow the spread is to release people en masse. \u201cPeople are writing to the judge that they want to be deported as soon as possible. They don\u2019t want to continue fighting,\u201d said a detainee from El Salvador in his 30s, who declined to give his name. He said he was trying to self-deport and was also helping an asylum seeker seek deportation. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019d prefer to go home instead of being in this jail.\u2019 \u2026 Ice has to release all the people, immediately.\u201d One of the detainees speaking out and advocating for the release of immigrant prisoners is Dr Sirous Asgari, an Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US trial last year but continues to face detention. The 59-year-old professor shared his story with the Guardian last week, prompting Iran\u2019s foreign minister to call for his release. The men were first detained at the Alexandria staging facility (ASF) in Louisiana, where Asgari said Ice was continuing to bring in new detainees from around the country in cramped quarters where they were denied masks and basic supplies to protect themselves. Then on 26 March, ASF staff put up a sign outside the pod where they slept, which said the room was under \u201cmedical observation\u201d due to the possibility of exposure, saying the risk was \u201chigh\u201d, Asgari recounted this week. He heard that a detainee had a fever. But Ice, he alleged, gave the detainees no information and declined to tell them whether it was Covid-19. \u201cEverybody got panicked,\u201d he said, describing a chaotic scene of the detainees yelling for help and information. \u201cWe had two elderly people in their 70s, younger people with respiratory problems. One guy is crying, saying, \u2018My life is in danger, we have been exposed.\u2019 People were screaming, \u2018Give us masks!\u2019 \u2026 \u2018We\u2019re gonna die!\u2019\u201d One officer suggested there was nothing to worry about, but then staff kept the pod completely isolated from other detainees, suggesting they were under quarantine, Asgari said. Despite what seemed to be a strict quarantine, seven of them were deported to Colombia a few days later, he said. Roughly 30 men who remained behind were then taken to Winn, but were still given no information, the detainees said. But once they had medical visits, he said they confirmed their fears after asking the nurse to look at their records, which all said \u201cpossible exposure to Covid-19\u201d and listed as 8 April as a \u201crelease date\u201d which would be the end of a 14-day quarantine period. The men joined a dozen other detainees in that facility who were also suspected of having exposure, Asgari said. Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, declined to respond to many of their specific claims, but said no detainee has tested positive for Covid-19 at ASF. He did not answer questions about whether the men were given tests or whether there was a direct exposure or quarantine. He said Ice groups detainees in \u201cmedical cohorts\u201d, meaning separating potential Covid-19 patients from others, but said that a \u201ccohort for potential exposure does not mean a person has been exposed\u201d. He said the men were spreading \u201cunsubstantiated rumor and false allegations\u201d, but did not offer specifics. \u201cWe are just a number to them. They don\u2019t care,\u201d said a detainee in his 30s who is facing deportation to Guatemala, and was also moved from ASF to Winn alongside Asgari. \u201cI\u2019m really afraid \u2026 They put you in jail with all these people and you don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve come from. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d This detainee said he had lived in the US for more than a decade and that he was arrested in New York in mid-March as Ice continued its raids and arrests amid the worsening pandemic. He said he has little information about his case and is fighting to get out: \u201cI\u2019m trying to do something, but I can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t seen a judge, nothing. They are just moving me around.\u201d \u2018Disgusting\u2019 conditions and silence from Ice The men said the conditions at Winn were appalling. The detainees are responsible for all cleaning, and there is a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds roughly two feet apart from each other, and the humidity when they first arrived left the sheets wet and beds rusted, they alleged. \u201cWhen we got inside, everyone was absolutely shocked at the living conditions,\u201d said Asgari, who has a history of respiratory problems and is at risk of death. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, disgusting and humiliating. We get outside for one hour a day. That\u2019s the only good thing.\u201d By Friday, a majority of the detainees were suffering from some kind of cold, according to Asgari, who said he now has a bad cough and fears it will infect his lungs. They don\u2019t have fevers, and he said he hopes it\u2019s not coronavirus. The man from El Salvador said the staff at Winn were taking their temperatures daily, but otherwise doing little else related to Covid-19 prevention. He said Ice should consider releasing them in the US for their own safety, noting that he didn\u2019t know the status of the outbreak in El Salvador and whether it would be dangerous to return. But ultimately, he said he was desperate to get out, fearing staff could bring the virus to the facility or that he could be moved again and exposed to hundreds more detainees in other jails. One Ice officer told him he could submit a formal request and get a reply in seven or eight days, he said: \u201cI want to know what is happening with us. They don\u2019t answer, nothing.\u201d On Friday, the man from El Salvador was deported, according to Asgari. Asgari has also been trying to self-deport to Iran, where there is a massive Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cThey are asking to be sent anywhere but there,\u201d said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney who has talked to multiple Winn detainees and is helping Asgari\u2019s family. \u201cPeople are seeking asylum and they are saying, \u2018Just send me back.\u2019 That speaks to the horrific conditions.\u201d Cox, the Ice spokesman, said all detainees are screened upon arrival to facilities and that Ice conducts Covid-19 testing in accordance with US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. He said Ice provides soap and \u201cother appropriate cleaning supplies\u201d and \u201cnecessary and appropriate medical care\u201d to detainees. Advocates have raised similar complaints about Ice conditions across the country. Karlyn Kurichety, an attorney with immigrant rights group Al Otro Lado, said that at California\u2019s largest Ice jail, detainees lack basic sanitation supplies and that Ice has placed some detainees in quarantine without telling them why. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned there\u2019s going to be a massive outbreak in one of these facilities, and literally thousands of people could die,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
