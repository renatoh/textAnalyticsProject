Asthmatics need to get immunised because colds and flu are the main trigger for potential fatal flare-ups of the disease, according to the charity Asthma UK. Most asthmatics are entitled to a flu jab free on the NHS as they are classed as a vulnerable group. But a poll has found that almost one in four people with asthma do not plan to have the jab ahead of the cold spell. The survey of 1,010 adults with asthma shows that 23% of them do not intend to get vaccinated this year. Of those, 31% said they were worried about the jab\u2019s side-effects, 27% doubted it would work and 45% said they did not think they would need it because their asthma was not bothering them enough to warrant getting it. In addition, 17% blamed their reluctance on an aversion to injections and 6% on the length of time it can take to get an appointment at their GP\u2019s surgery. \u201cPeople with asthma who are shunning the flu jab could be playing Russian roulette with their life,\u201d said Dr Andy Whittamore, Asthma UK\u2019s clinical lead and a practising GP. \u201cThe majority of people with asthma say colds and flu are their top trigger, so it makes sense for them to try and protect themselves by getting the flu jab. \u201cUnfortunately there are lots of myths about the flu jab not working, causing side-effects or causing flu, and our research shows this is preventing people from getting it.\u201d Deaths from flu and deaths from serious breathing problems both peak during winter. Asthma claimed 1,410 lives during 2016, the last year for which full-year figures are available. Asthmatics who are using preventative medicine, have needed steroids to control their condition or have been admitted to hospital after an asthma attack can get a free flu jab. Victoria Taylor, a 29-year-old from Southampton who has Asthma, fell seriously ill after she did not have the flu jab. \u201cIt was terrifying and felt like my lungs were filled with cement. I had to call an ambulance and spent a week in hospital recovering. I had no idea that flu could be so dangerous for people with asthma and it nearly killed me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
