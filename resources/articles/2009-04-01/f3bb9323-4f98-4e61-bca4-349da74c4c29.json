Zardari ratified the sharia law regulations after receiving cross-party support during a late evening sitting of parliament. During a short debate the prime minister, Yousaf Reza Gilani, said the new law had \"the support of the nation\". In Swat, some residents celebrated in the streets, hoping the law would herald a return of peace to the violence-ridden valley, home to a ski resort and a one-time honeymooners' favourite. But that outcome was far from certain. Human rights activists condemned the law, worrying it would presage the spread of Taliban rule to other parts of Pakistan. \"I don't think this law is going to appease the Taliban. It's just going to give them a taste of victory,\" said Asma Jahangir, the United Nations special rapporteur on religious freedoms. The politicians were acting under pressure from the Taliban, who had threatened to collapse a fragile peace deal in Swat if the law was not enacted. Earlier, a Taliban spokesman said that any politician who voted against the law would be considered an apostate, a crime that carries the death penalty under traditional Islamic law. In parliament the only dissenting voice came from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a minority coalition partner which abstained from the vote. \"The government is buying peace at gunpoint,\" one minister, Farooq Sattar, said on his return to the party stronghold of Karachi for a crisis meeting. \"This will have far reaching consequences for the idea of a moderate and liberal Pakistan.\" Swat's civil law system, inherited from the British empire, will be replaced with an Islamic legal system. Taliban officials have said they considered Islamic law the first step in a broader movement encompassing economic, political and social change. Pakistan's western allies worry that the new law represents a surrender to the forces they are fighting across the border in Afghanistan, where President Barack Obama has approved the deployment of an extra 21,000 American troops. Hours earlier in Islamabad, the government welcomed former US presidential candidate Senator John Kerry, who has tabled a bill in congress that would boost non-military aid to Pakistan to $1.5bn a year. This is not the first attempt to introduce sharia law in Swat. During the 1990s a civilian government introduced a similar law that was poorly implemented. The difference this time is that it has been introduced after the effective capitulation of the government, highlighting the crumbling writ of the state in the North West Frontier province. Last February the provincial government, led by the secular Awami National party, struck an accord with the Taliban to exchange the promise of Islamic law in Swat for peace following a campaign of suicide bombings, assassinations and intimidation. The ANP said it had to resort to a deal following the failure of the Pakistan army to quell an 18-month Islamist insurgency that left thousands dead and caused more than 100,000 people to flee the valley. Many ANP activists said the army, which has a history of supporting jihadist militias, was either unable or unwilling to defeat the Taliban. Public debate over the deal was re-ignited 10 days ago after a video emerged showing black-turbaned militants flogging a teenage girl from Swat as punishment for an alleged sexual misdemeanour. But last night, under growing pressure from the Taliban and ANP, and with political cover from parliament, Zardari signed the controversial law. Few analysts believe it will bring lasting peace. Ali Dayan Hasan, senior South Asia researcher with Human Rights Watch, said Pakistan was \"oscillating between fighting the bad war and making the bad peace\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
