In the reception area, an entire wall bears the faces of supporters at the 1987 FA Cup final, basking in the day Keith Houchen and company really did turn the football world sky blue. Taking the time to greet guests is another of that vintage, Steve Ogrizovic, these days the goalkeeping coach and still one of the first into work at the club he helped make famous. It is a disarming scene and another will present itself when Coventry, third in League Two, face the Premier League strugglers Stoke City on Saturday in a third-round tie that has most of the required ingredients for an upset. Mark Hughes will play the part of embattled visiting manager; the Ricoh Arena will provide the pudding of a rugby-scarred playing surface; and there is a little more history to draw on, too. In the fifth round of that glorious run 31 years ago, when Coventry were top-flight stalwarts and their opponents were rooted in the second tier, Micky Gynn settled a gritty encounter at the Potters\u2019 old Victoria Ground to set history firmly on its course. There was barely a blade of grass on the pitch that day too, but little else can be found in common now. The happy notion of recreating old times is one thing, but at Coventry the present remains so troubled that even the opportunity for a little escapism is tempered. They hit rock bottom last season, dropping into the fourth tier for the first time in almost 60 years, but under Mark Robins they now have a young, vibrant team of which those fans who still attend games are justly proud. The obstacle most cannot shift from their peripheral vision is Sisu, the hedge fund that recently marked 10 years of ownership \u2013 a spell coinciding almost exactly with their steep decline \u2013 and shows no sign of going away despite a series of well-documented controversies and a raft of cost-cutting measures. \u201cThere\u2019s a real hatred \u2013 I think that\u2019s not too strong a word \u2013 for Sisu among a great deal of fans,\u201d says Moz Baker, chair of the Sky Blue Trust supporters\u2019 organisation. \u201cThe anger doesn\u2019t seem to have dissipated but there aren\u2019t the same huge protests we saw in the past, because I think a lot of people got protest fatigue. What\u2019s happening instead is that people are just drifting away and getting out of that Coventry City habit, which is a tragedy really.\u201d In football, apathy tends to be a far more damaging malady than rage. When Stoke visit there are unlikely to be demonstrations similar to those that led to three of Coventry\u2019s League One matches being temporarily halted last winter. Instead the picture in the stands will speak volumes. Around 11,500 tickets had been sold on Friday morning, which seems a fair improvement on this season\u2019s average gate of 7,507 until it dawns that 3,500 of them have been bought by Stoke fans. Their mean attendance for the calendar year of 2007, which brought Sisu\u2019s takeover in mid-December, was 20,342. \u201cWhen I came back in the summer I was thinking that if we could get around the play-offs at Christmas we might hopefully get bigger crowds,\u201d says Michael Doyle, their captain, who returned to the club last summer having spent eight years there from 2003 to 2011. \u201cBut it\u2019s not happened yet to be honest and that\u2019s a bit disappointing. But we\u2019ll keep plugging away. Like with everything, success will determine things in terms of drawing people back.\u201d That was shown in April when 45,000 supporters travelled back to Wembley for the Checkatrade Trophy final win over Oxford United, but a single afternoon rich in nostalgia was not enough. The biggest tail-off came during the disastrous season and a quarter groundsharing with Northampton Town at Sixfields; Coventry\u2019s core support has not really picked up since their return in 2014 and there are fears of a repeat. Sisu is currently appealing against a high court decision to bar it from contesting the Ricoh Arena\u2019s sale by Coventry city council to its present owners, the rugby club Wasps. Sisu claims the ground was significantly undervalued; the row will rumble through the courts into next year and has stalled discussions between Wasps and Coventry about extending the club\u2019s deal to use the facility, which expires at the end of this season. A 12-month extension seems the likely, barely satisfactory outcome but Sisu\u2019s own motivations remain unclear \u2013 even more so because it has reportedly rejected four takeover bids from a consortium led by the businessman Gary Hoffman, the most recent totalling around \u00a320m, for a club that outwardly seems nothing but a millstone. \u201cWhat they are holding out for, nobody knows,\u201d Baker says. \u201cIf they think they are going to get anything like the \u00a360m they invested then clearly that is ludicrous. Why they are still here, I don\u2019t know.\u201d It puts Hughes\u2019s struggles at Stoke, such a stable proposition under Peter Coates, into some context. Hughes\u2019s grip on his job is more precarious though and he might feel Robins owes him a favour. Earlier in the week he was keen to point out that Robins\u2019s famous FA Cup third round goal for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest in 1990 came from his own cross, a delicate delivery served up with the outside of his right foot. The two are no longer in contact but Robins laughed when reminded on Friday, remembering how the pecking order at Old Trafford more frequently worked. \u201cHe had a Porsche and I had a Polo,\u201d he said of his former team-mate. The metaphor still holds more or less true today; the hope for Robins and Coventry is that a performance in line with their old heroics will go some way towards getting the club back up to speed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
