Word has it a meeting with editor-in-chief Paul Dacre rapidly ensued, followed a short while later by a notice pinned by the lift announcing Collins' promotion to executive editor. All's well that ends well, eh? \u00b7 But can the same be said of the unfortunate case of blurb envy that appears to have broken out at Associated? Rumour has it that Richard Littlejohn is increasingly exasperated by the giant front-page puffs for fellow Mail columnist Allison Pearson, culminating last week, as Monkey pointed out, with a half-page blurb for a three-paragraph column. Littlejohn didn't even get a sniff of a mention on last Tuesday's cover. Spare a thought for associate editor Martin Clarke, on whom Littlejohn has apparently vented his spleen. But talk of a cover-mounted Littlejohn doll is apparently wide of the mark. \u00b7 A children's modelling competition took a turn for the worse at Bradford's Telegraph and Argus when a member of staff had some fun with the entry coupon. Next to the box marked \"sex\", a joker decided to type \"yes please\". Unfortunately, this was the version that ended up in the paper. Monkey calls for a chat, but the Newsquest paper was oddly unwilling to talk about it. \u00b7 At the launch of his Channel Five John Osborne biopic, film-maker Tony Palmer mulled over the problems of getting brainy docs commissioned in today's reality-centric TV environment. Palmer told Sir David Frost how he had once pitched a Rudyard Kipling documentary to a BBC arts supremo. Having heard all the spiel about \"If\" having won a national poem poll, and being seen by anyone walking on to Wimbledon's Centre Court, the BBC executive allegedly turned to a colleague and said: \"Kipling, Kipling, Kipling ... how do I know that name?\" Cakes, probably. \u00b7 Monkey's unfortunate TV ad of the week: Davina McCall, promoting Garnier Nutrisse Cream. The phone rings. It's Davina's mum. \"I saw your show!\" says mum. She's the only one who did. \u00b7 Emap's Magic radio probably thought it was on to a good thing when it tied up a deal with Associated Newspapers that meant its Mappin House HQ in central London was flooded with free copies of the Daily Mail. Unfortunately, it prompted widespread complaints from Emap magazine staffers also based at Mappin House, who took offence at copies of the \"Daily Hate\" lying all over the place. And the identity of the offended hacks? Why, it's those sensitive types at Zoo and FHM. Perhaps if they covered up the Mail's front page they wouldn't have been so offended. \u00b7 The new Channel 4 News contract is worth more than \u00a3100m to ITN. But how much of the cash goes on Jon Snow's ties? Alas, we will never know, as the cost and supplier of the great man's neckwear are being kept secret by C4, one of 53 facts and figures it has requested not be released under the Freedom of Information Act. Monkey can reveal that Snow has a penchant for Paul Smith ties, and once made a point of finding out his suppliers and going direct to them. Not only did this presumably save money, it is also a wily way of preventing others copying his unique look. Next week: where Snow buys his bicycle clips? \u00b7 Five years after Greg Dyke called the BBC \"hideously white\", it appears that the corporation still has some way to go. A double page picture of most of the 200 production staff behind Doctor Who in the Radio Times reveals just two black faces, one of them Noel Clarke, who plays Mickey Smith. Defeating the Daleks is one thing, employing more members of an ethnic minority is quite another. \u00b7 Is new editor Matthew d'Ancona planning to turn the Spectator into Stuff magazine? Monkey only asks after he told PR Week he wanted \"more consumer topics - gadgets, luxury goods and so on\". A month into his new job, d'Ancona has been careful not to criticise his predecessor, Boris Johnson, but says the Spectator has become \"more information rich - more news, mischief, gossip and revelations - not arid facts\" since he took over. As opposed to the dry, information-poor organ he inherited from Johnson, presumably."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
