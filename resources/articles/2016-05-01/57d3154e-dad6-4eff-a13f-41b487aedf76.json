Official figures have shown a drop in the proportion of Neets \u2013 young people not in education, employment or training \u2013 as the economy has recovered from recession since mid-2011. But the new analysis tracks young people for longer than the official snapshot figures and suggests a large proportion are still shut out of the jobs market and education for extended periods. The researchers, who released their report ahead of the latest official Neet figures on Thursday, warned that such long spells out of education or work can scar young people\u2019s prospects for the rest of their lives. The analysis, published by the youth employment and education charity Impetus-PEF, found an average of 1.3 million 16- to 24-year-olds, or 17% of the age group, spend six months Neet. That contrasts with official figures showing that in the final three months of 2015, 11.8% of young people were Neet. The chair of the Social Mobility Commission, Alan Milburn, said the new figures drew attention to young people at risk of being forgotten. \u201cThis research places much-needed focus on a significant population of young people who are often overlooked and under-supported,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial mobility is not just about getting graduates into the professions but making sure that every child in the UK is given the chance to follow a path into education or employment for the long term.\u201d The Learning and Work Institute, which carried out the research for Impetus-PEF, analysed groups of young people over a three-year period to get a long-term picture that is not provided in the official figures, which record the number of Neets at a particular moment in time. The researchers used the same Labour Force Survey figures as the Office for National Statistics for its Neet numbers. The researchers also found 700,000 young people, or 10%, were spending a year out of employment, education and training. Impetus-PEF hopes its new youth jobs index, to be updated annually, will give a wider picture of youth unemployment and keep the government focused on helping the most disengaged young people, even as headline employment statistics improve. Andy Ratcliffe, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMore than a million young people in this country are wasting six months not working or learning. This can have knock-on effects for the rest of their lives, reducing their opportunities and earnings. \u201cSo while we should celebrate the good news that the number of young people who are out of work or education has been falling in recent years, we need to make sure those young people who spent long periods Neet don\u2019t miss the party. Helping the young people furthest from work is essential to meeting the government\u2019s manifesto commitment to abolishing youth unemployment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
