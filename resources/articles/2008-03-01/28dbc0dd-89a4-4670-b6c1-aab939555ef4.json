Founders meet at university, establish business in living room, then three years of massive internet growth later sell it to international conglomerate for $850m (\u00a3417m) \u2013 cash. Bebo has about 40 million users globally and claims to be the top social networking website in Britain, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States it lags behind News Corporation's MySpace and Facebook. However, the company is one of the few leading lights of the second dotcom boom with a very British thread running through it. Founders Michael and Xochi Birch met while students in London. He was a north Londoner, she was a Californian on a study abroad programme. The venue was the bar of University College. They graduated, married, and got what they describe as unexciting computing jobs. Birthdayalarm.com was an earlier stab at social networking. The couple founded it in 2001 with Michael's brother Paul as an easy way to remember friends' birthdays. It was such a success they added features and an early web 2.0 site was born. After eight years in London together the Birches moved to California with their two children in 2002. Michael, long-haired and laid back, describes himself as being a \"'true as the Queen of England' Englishman\", while Xochi says after eight years in London she can talk about the weather as much as any Briton. They paid $8,000 for the domain name Bebo, because it was snappy, available and meaningless. Now it has come to stand for \"Blog early, blog often\". The Birches launched the site in January 2005 from their San Francisco living room and swiftly relaunched it in July of the same year. But it was in Britain that Bebo really took off, particularly among school children. Early in 2006 London-based venture capitalists Benchmark, now renamed Balderton, saw the potential and invested \u00a38m in the company for a 15.7% stake. In August 2006 the site had 25 million users around the globe, now it has 40 million. It was in 2007 that everyone really sat up and took notice of Bebo. The site scored a big online hit with the drama KateModern. A multitude of companies partnered with the site, including Yahoo, Microsoft and Apple. BT and Viacom reportedly made approaches to buy Bebo. Michael, who takes the title chief executive, and Xochi, Bebo president, hired Joanna Shields from Google to be president, international. Growth was big on her agenda. Last year Bebo launched a Polish language version and subsidiary sites in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Holland. Birch has said social networking websites were better for children than \"mind-numbing\" TV. \"It's fun, helping them learn to communicate, develop social skills, learning a lot of creativity. They are becoming mini-publishers, creating videos and other stuff.\" Shields told MediaGuardian the business was profitable: \"It's ad-supported and the numbers really stack up. It doesn't cost a lot of money to run this business, and if you are an advertiser and want to reach this demographic, they don't watch that much TV so this is the way to reach them.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
