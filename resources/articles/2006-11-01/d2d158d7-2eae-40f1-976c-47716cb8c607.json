The street is filled with peals of laughter in anticipation of the weekend. But the location of Soho Parish school, squeezed between two seedy bars, makes it quite unusual - and puts it at the centre of Westminster council's battle to rescue the district from its sleazy reputation and turn it into a more \"savoury\" place to live. Just half an hour after the school pick-up, young women at the neon-lit doorways of Illusions and the Soho Cabaret Bar are in full swing for the weekend as they beckon male passers-by. These women, in tight-fitting clothes and heavy make-up, do not fit into Westminster's plans to transform the area. The council wants to sweep out the bars in order to titillate investors and developers. A public consultation with the area's 4,000 residents - 50% of whom live in social housing - on a Soho action plan ended last month. And support for the school, with 140 pupils, features in the regeneration plans. The school dates back some 300 years. Thanks to its status as a voluntary-aided Church of England school, it expanded its premises last year into a building in the adjoining road, paid for by the Diocese of London. But the school now needs to raise \u00a31.175m to buy the long-term lease from the diocese. It has until next year to pay up or make other arrangements. Village atmosphere When its headteacher, Rachel Earnshaw, arrived five years ago, some year groups had to share a classroom. Making sure each year group had its own room was one of her first successes. But physical constraints, Earnshaw points out, can be an advantage: \"Our classrooms are so small, our average class size is only 20. That's absolutely fantastic. Teachers always say that they can really teach at this school because they've got small classes.\" The size of the school also helps with social cohesiveness, which is important given the cultural and social diversity at the school. Eligibility for free school meals is slightly higher than the national average, at 23.7%. Some 15 different languages are spoken by pupils and English is a second language for around half of them. About two-thirds of the intake come from the local Bangladeshi community and Chinese families in nearby Chinatown. \"Because we're small there is the feeling of being a village school,\" says Earnshaw. \"Soho actually has a village feel to it, and we're the village school.\" An academic transformation is also under way. Its 1998 Ofsted inspection found problems with standards in mathematics and support for children who need help with English as a second language. But Ofsted inspectors found quite a different school when they last visited in 2004. They reported that by year 6, pupils were achieving well \"as a result of very good teaching\" in all subjects. The 2004 report praised, in particular, the standard of teaching about morality and spirituality at the school, which takes children from a range of faiths and cultural backgrounds. As the school improves, what happens on its doorstep becomes increasingly unacceptable to members of the council. Audrey Lewis, cabinet member for licensing and community protection, says: \"We have a particular objection to the appearance of these women in skimpy clothes and what's going on in those places, because they are close to a primary school. \"People often come to Soho just looking to have a good time. But what they don't realise is that Soho has a well-established community that needs protecting.\" One criminal activity the community needs protection from is extortion, which, the police and council say, goes on in some local bars. Unlike the area's licensed strip clubs, these so-called \"clip joints\" extort money from people, say the council and the police. Women entice men into the bars with the promise of adult entertainment, which often doesn't exist. The entrance fee is usually around \u00a35. But once inside, men end up being charged a \"hostess fee\" plus other hidden costs that often result in a bill for hundreds of pounds. As part of their attempts to tidy up Soho, the council and police have made repeated attempts to close down bars close to the school, but have so far failed because of difficulties in persuading victims to give evidence. Children cope well Chief Inspector John Dale says: \"My frustration about the school is that parents and children are subjected to that environment.\" But parents and teachers appear less concerned about their unusual neighbours and say they have not put pressure on the police or council to close the bars. Steve Johnson has two boys at the school and is head of the parent-teacher association. He says he \"loves\" bringing his two sons through the lively streets of Soho and there has been little pressure from other parents to close the clubs. \"One parent had a double pushchair that was too big to get through the school gate, so she had to park it outside one of the clubs. She was told to move it by one of the girls because it was 'bad for business'. But it was all good humoured.\" Earnshaw admits there are added pressures put on her school by the local bars. \"We've got clubs and all sorts of things going on after school so they are leaving at different times and inevitably they see things we would much prefer they didn't,\" she says. \"Sometimes they've witnessed fights. Obviously we'd like to see the back of them.\" But she says the children cope well. \"It is more in your face because of where we are. They are quite aware of some of the seedier side of Soho, but they have a sensible and mature attitude to it because they've grown up with it. They're not fascinated by it, they just know it's something to be avoided and steered clear of.\" Earnshaw says that thanks to cooperation between police, parents and staff, children are able to learn, play and make friends undisturbed by the turf war between the owners of the bars next door and Westminster council. Sarah Richardson, Westminster's cabinet member for education, agrees there is little risk of the children being exposed to too much, too young. \"You've got a very moral school that is operating among the sex trade. But once inside that school, the wonderful environment counteracts it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
