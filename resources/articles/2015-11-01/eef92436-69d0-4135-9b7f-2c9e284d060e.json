On the night you try and protect yourself or not know what\u2019s going on. But slowly you realise the shock is a bit after.\u201d If they need time, they will have it. The characteristics Wenger is looking for from Koscielny and Giroud before selecting his team for the trip to The Hawthorns are \u201cresilience and desire to play\u201d. Koscielny appeared visibly affected by the atrocities when he played in the friendly against England at Wembley on Tuesday. \u201cHe had a fantastic game against Germany, and you could see that on Tuesday night he was not himself,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cIt affected him deeply and I didn\u2019t recognise the player I saw on Friday night on Tuesday night. \u201cI will talk with him to see if he is completely recovered and focused. It\u2019s a big game for us. You have to trust the player in these kind of situations. Today in the Premier League you don\u2019t get away with it with 80% focus. You have to be completely committed. What I will want from him is that he\u2019s completely committed and feels ready. If not, I will not play him.\u201d With other matches in Germany and Belgium postponed during the international week Wenger considered whether there was a broader issue with players feeling anxious about security around football stadiums. \u201cI don\u2019t think suddenly every game is under threat. But who knows what the future is or how strong the organisation is? Or how many people in France or England are prepared \u2013 as from what I\u2019ve heard, they planned a multi-European attack as well. We have to live with that and just get on with our lives.\u201d The Arsenal manager was in Paris last Friday night. He had been due to attend the France v Germany game at the Stade de France but was running late and decided to watch the match on television from his hotel. \u201cI was not far from the event and I think everybody who was in Paris on Friday night was in shock,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance is, like England, a tolerant and generous country and to discover how much your own citizens hate you and hate the country is of course a huge shock for everybody. You wonder what is going on there. Why does this country get this kind of treatment? I believe at the moment nobody in France has found an answer or a real explanation for what\u2019s going on and why, because what was targeted was the way of life, basically. Football, going out, listening to music. It\u2019s more way of life that is targeted than any individual community. \u201cYou always think after this kind of event: do you continue or do you stop your life? For me they made the right decision to play at Wembley and I believe the event on Tuesday night has shown that it was the right decision. The football world has responded the way you want it to respond in a big union and a big togetherness. \u201cAt some stage we have to be responsible adults and show strength and not to lie down. In England you have a history of that, of saying: \u2018Let\u2019s get on with our lives and show that we are strong\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
