Take BBC2's Crufts coverage and the announcement of the \"Friends for Life\" winner, voted by viewers. \"You have been voting in your thousands and the presentation will now be made live in the main ring,\" announced Clare Balding. Except someone in the gallery pressed a wrong button, revealing that the winner had already been interviewed by Balding's colleague. Live? Nothing of the sort. \u00b7 Giles Hattersley, previously on the Sunday Times' News Review section, starts as Arena editor today after a memorable send-off from his former organ. It took the form of a gigantic correction to a January article by Hattersley about Lord Lambton (\"Lord Louche, sex king of Chiantishire\"), which stated that Lambton's son, now Lord Durham, held a party with his sister Catherine that led to the peer banning him from his villa, Cetinale. \"In fact,\" the Sunday Times glumly noted, \"Lord Durham does not have a sister called Catherine, there has not been an orgiastic party of any kind, and Lord Lambton did not ban him from Cetinale at all.\" Apart from that... Why the paper only grovelled three days after Hattersley's defection was announced, and more than two months after the article, is a mystery. \u00b7 Hattersley narrowly beats this correction from the Financial Times: \"The White House described the Democratic Iraq withdrawal proposals as being 'aimed at bringing comity to their internal politics', not comedy as stated in an article on March 9. The word comedy was taken from the original White House transcript which was corrected after we had gone to press.\" \u00b7 Jimmy Mulville and Aidan Barclay were among the media types targeted by the women's team in BBC1's celebrity Apprentice as they attempted to raise money for Comic Relief. We know this because their names were on a list held up by Trinny Woodall. Fortunately Mulville and Barclay's mobile numbers were not written down, unlike another name on the list, Nick Mason, whose number was clearly legible to anyone with a pause button. We can only hope he did not get too many calls from people ringing to ask if he is the same Nick Mason who plays drums in Pink Floyd. \u00b7 A mouse has died under the floorboards of the Westminster office of the Daily Telegraph. Reporters gagging at the stench tried opening the windows but could not work because of the din from peace protestor Brian Haw and his \"Tony B-Liar\" bellowing. If only they had used a mousetrap or, as they say in brave new Telegraph world, a rodent entrapment hub. \u00b7 The BBC appears to be taking Jeremy Paxman's eco-concerns to heart and has told World Service staff in Bush House that their water coolers will be taken away. Not only are they bad for the environment and on one occasion started a fire, they cost \u00a328,000 a year. How long before the rest of the BBC follows suit? \u00b7 The Daily Telegraph has come up with a wizard way of cutting costs, sorry, introducing more flexible working hours, by slicing freelance subbing shifts in half. The new shifts, between 5.30pm and 10pm, pay 60% of the standard shift rate, or \u00a381. \"This would allow you the chance to do other work during the day, while the newspaper could utilise your talents at our busiest time when a full shift is not required,\" suggests an email. The opportunity to work an 18-hour day may be too much for most subs to resist. \u00b7 To Lisa Opie's MySpace page, where it turns out the Five managing director, content, has almost as many friends as she has viewers - eight. Among them are her Five colleagues Kim Peat, Steve Gowans and Nick Wilson. Monkey respectfully suggests that other Five types might like to follow suit. Pronto. \u00b7 Monkey's number of the week: 49. The percentage of BBC3's primetime output (7pm to 11pm) devoted to BBC1 shows and their spin-offs last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
