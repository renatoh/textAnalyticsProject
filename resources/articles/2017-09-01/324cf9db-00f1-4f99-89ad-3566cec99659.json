He sabotaged my film", "bodyText": "He was one of cinema\u2019s biggest stars, but Marlon Brando behaved like a \u201cmonster\u201d and seemed \u201chell-bent on sabotaging\u201d The Island of Dr Moreau, one of his last films, according to its screenwriter. When Ron Hutchinson was asked to work on a film with The Godfather star in 1996, he could not believe his luck. In adapting HG Wells\u2019s science fiction novel about a renegade scientist who creates an island of monsters, Hutchinson would be working with one of his great acting idols, as well as the acclaimed director John Frankenheimer. There was the added bonus of spending a couple of months on the Great Barrier Reef and in the rainforests of northern Australia. But when Hutchinson joined the production team, he witnessed \u201cone of the legendary movie disasters of all time\u201d, describing it as a \u201c$40m train wreck\u201d. He was shocked to discover that Brando \u2013 who he claims arrived on location \u201cweighing about 300 pounds\u201d \u2013 would not recite words written for him: \u201cHe wanted to improvise it all.\u201d And Brando would rarely emerge from his trailer: \u201cThey were flying in these hapless [studio] executives to try to beg him to come out of his damned trailer. \u201cBrando was only answering the door when the pizza man came. This was the best news that the pizza-makers of Cairns, this small town, had ever had because Brando was consuming industrial quantities of pizza while ruminating on what the hell he was going to do when he had to face the cameras. I think there might have been an existential terror there.\u201d Hutchinson, who was born in Northern Ireland, is an Emmy award-winning screenwriter, Olivier-nominated playwright and was writer-in-residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company before making the move to work in Hollywood. His five previous collaborations with Frankenheimer included the Emmy-winning Against The Wall, about the 1971 Attica prison riot, starring Samuel L Jackson. Next month, Oberon Books will publish his memoir, Clinging to the Iceberg: Writing for a Living on the Stage and in Hollywood. In it he has relived a painful chapter of his career \u2013 so painful that he has never watched The Island of Dr Moreau since its completion. In an interview with the Observer, Hutchinson recalled that he had been working with the director Stephen Daldry on a revival of his 1984 Royal Court hit, Rat in the Skull, when he was contacted by Frankenheimer. Although Brando revolutionised acting with his mesmerising performances in classics such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront, he was known to loathe producers, directors and even acting. Frankenheimer had warned Hutchinson that there were difficulties with working with Brando, sending over some initial footage shot after he replaced the original director, Richard Stanley. \u201cHe [Frankenheimer] said: \u2018Take a look at these [tapes] before you actually commit.\u2019 They showed Brando sitting in a hammock with literally the smallest person who\u2019s ever been measured by scientists, the actor Nelson De la Rosa who was just under 28 inches tall. \u201cBrando absolutely fell in love with this guy. He put him on his chest in the hammock and sang \u2018Frog Went A-Courting\u2019 to him. There was 90 minutes of that. John said: \u2018This is all I can persuade Brando to do.\u2019\u2009\u201d Hutchinson writes in his book: \u201cBy this stage of his life Brando, playing the God of Moreau\u2019s island and emerging as the God of the production, was way beyond bored with the making of movies. Overweight, unprepared, mocking, dismissive, on the razor\u2019s edge where caprice becomes malice, the case for the prosecution is therefore easily made. He was indeed here to sabotage this movie.\u201d He continues: \u201cBrando placed a kitchen colander on his head, slathered himself in sunscreen, fell in love with Nelson, retired to his trailer and refused to leave it.\u201d Looking back, Hutchinson now notes the irony that, in making a film about an island of monsters, everybody in the movie turned into a monster: \u201cEverybody behaved monstrously to each other.\u201d He was shocked to discover the \u201cpoisonous\u201d relations between Brando and most of the other actors. Careful about mentioning names, Hutchinson refers to incidents including a \u201cprohibition\u201d on one actor being allowed to handle a gun \u2013 even one that fired blanks. There was such intense hatred that the executives eventually \u201cthrew up their arms\u201d and asked the actors to film \u201ca one-man show\u201d that would be stitched together in post-production: \u201cIt was an island of crazy people \u2013 an awful experience.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
