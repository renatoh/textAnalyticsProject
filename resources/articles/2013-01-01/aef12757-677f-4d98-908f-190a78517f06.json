But the audience also saw the number of serious injuries sustained by this year's competitors garner as many headlines as the gold medals carried off by superstars like Shaun White. Concussions, spine fractures and brain injuries were among the injuries sustained. Organisers reported on Sunday that the skiers Rose Battersby and Ashley Battersby (no relation) had sustained a spinal fracture and a leg injury respectively during a women's final. An injury sustained by 25-year-old freestyle snowmobiler Caleb Moore led to emergency heart surgery. On Sunday, Moore's family released a statement on his Facebook page: \"Caleb continues to be monitored in the ICU. His cardiac injury has led to a secondary complication involving his brain. The Moore family thanks all of Caleb's fans and friends for their support and for respecting their privacy.\" Hours before Moore's crash on Thursday, his family posted a practice injury photo with the caption: \"Coulda been waaaaaay worse! Game on tonight\". Moore's 23-year-old brother, Colten, who attempted the same course and separated his pelvis, has been released from the hospital. Athletes weren't the only attendees in harm's way, however. Patrons found themselves shaken but without a reported serious injury after a runaway snowmobile plowed into a crowd. Though the injuries reported this year were serious, athletes who attend the X Games have a history of pushing the limits. Last year, snowmobiler Justin Hoyer broke his arm while on the freestyle snowmobile course and though Shaun White pulled out of the men's Slopestyle competition to nurse an injured ankle, he was merely saving his energy to win a gold in his best event, the SuperSlope. The 2012 games were dedicated to Sarah Burke, a Canadian freestyle skier who died after landing on her head while performing a trick, days before the competition.
