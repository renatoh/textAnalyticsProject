In a statement released today, Whitman said: \"California faces challenges unlike any other time in its history - a weak and faltering economy, massive job losses, and an exploding state budget deficit. California is better than this, and I refuse to stand by and watch it fail. Now is the time for people across the state to join in a cause for change, excellence and a new California.\" Schwarzenegger is barred from seeking a third term when his mandate expires in 2010. And the possibility of replacing the former action movie star at the head of the state with the seventh largest economy in the world - and one of the biggest deficits - has spurred a high-profile field on both sides of the political divide. Whitman faces two weighty opponents for the Republican nomination, one of them, like Whitman, a former Silicon Valley CEO with a considerable personal fortune. Should she secure the Republican nomination, the Democrats offer even more substantial opposition. US senator Diane Feinstein would be the favourite to secure the Democratic nomination, should she decide to run. If Feinstein does not run, the battle would likely be between San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and the state's attorney general and former governor Jerry Brown. Both figures have national profiles: Newsom for his championing of gay marriage and other progressive causes, Brown for his unsuccessful attempt to secure the Democratic presidential nomination in 1982. Whitman, despite her business record and the name recognition for the company she helped turn into a global sales force, faces significant hurdles. A poll in November showed that 67% of California voters had no idea who she was. Furthermore, she has yet to stake out positions on some of the key issues facing voters in the state. She came out in favour of Proposition 8, the anti-gay marriage measure shortly before November's election, but her attitudes on other issues remain sketchy. Her personal fortune of $1.3bn (\u00a3872.1m) is also thought to be depleted. She was reported to have lost $580m as eBay's stock fell from its 2004 high. Whitman's move was highly anticipated and follows her announcement in January that she was standing down from her boardroom positions with eBay, Procter &amp; Gamble and Dreamworks Animation. Her political experience is thin. She registered as a Republican in 2007 and soon after began working for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. When that collapsed she joined John McCain's team as a national co-chair of his campaign. At one event, McCain praised Whitman as one of the three wisest people he knew, and she was subsequently offered a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. Whitman has already endured a few hiccups in her nascent political career. She is involved in a legal battle to wrest control of several internet domain names - including whitman2010.com and meg2010.com - from a California man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
