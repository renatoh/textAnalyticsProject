He pleaded guilty and apologised for striking his opponent. That contrition, the 20-year-old's previously clean record and a suggestion of provocation - although Bradford stressed there was no question of racial abuse - were taken into account. But he will miss the first four matches of his club's Super League title defence, including the repeat of last year's grand final against Wigan on March 1. \"It was a serious incident that has no place in the game,\" an RFL statement said. Brian Noble, the Bradford coach, agreed. \"We don't coach players to do things like that,\" he said. \"I've sat Leon down and he's been left in no doubt that he was out of order. It was completely out of character and he certainly knows that he can't do it again.\" Noble has still to decide whether to impose any further punishment on the player, who was a contender to fill the stand-off position vacated when Henry Paul moved to rugby union. Wigan and Leeds have brought forward their fifth-round cup ties to give them extra time to prepare for their opening Super League matches on March 1. Leeds will now play Hull Kingston Rovers at Headingley on Friday next week, with Wigan's game against Union Treiziste Catalan the following evening in Perpignan. The BBC will televise Warrington's game against the holders St Helens on Saturday next week, and Widnes versus Wakefield the following day. After the success of introducing French clubs to the competition over the past few years, the RFL is now planning to include two Russian teams in next season's draw and the Moscow Magicians and the Kazan Arrows have been invited on mini-tours in April. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
