Instead of bonding as a family at home, she and her husband took up almost permanent residence in the neonatal intensive care unit, watching and waiting to see if their daughters would survive. Segal\u2019s diary of those first 56 days of her daughters\u2019 lives creates a compelling and emotionally taut exploration of what it means to be a parent in unexpected and challenging circumstances. From the opening pages, when Segal describes her feelings about the psychological aftermath of her C-section and the immediate removal of her babies to intensive care, we know we are in unflinching territory: \u201cTaking my unready daughters from within me felt not like a birth but an evisceration. They were elsewhere and in need of me and needing more than I could give them.\u201d Similarly, when she first meets her babies, a day later, the description is both visceral and heartrending: \u201cI can trace their circulation, the fine leaf-veining of tributaries clearly beneath their backs\u2019 translucent skin. The exquisite transgression of their forming selves, caught in the act of becoming.\u201d Segal, who won the Costa first novel award for her highly acclaimed debut, The Innocents, brings a novelist\u2019s stylistic sensibility, a keen eye and a devastating honesty to events as they unfold. There is the moment when one of her daughters, at three days old, requires a canula and Segal cannot understand why there are so many medical staff present until the doctor explains that there is no pain relief given for the procedure and the staff are there to pin her baby down. There are infections that threaten not to be cured, intravenous lines that need to be taken out and readministered repeatedly and the discovery of holes in the babies\u2019 hearts. There is the quiet desolation of not being the first person to have dressed her babies and the suppression of pain from her C-section wound as she treks to and from the hospital. And there is the trauma of having to entrust the care of her children to others: \u201cLeaving my children each night is an amputation, over and over.\u201d And yet, amid the bleakness and despair, there is both light and warmth. In order to provide breast milk for their premature babies, a room is set aside in neonatal intensive care for the mothers to express milk that will then be administered to their sons and daughters in tiny, painstaking quantities. This room, Segal tells us, is nicknamed \u201cthe milking shed\u201d and here she meets a group of women whose support and guidance become invaluable. There is Sophie who \u201cwill spur me on like a sergeant. She will lift me up like an angel.\u201d There is Kemisha, a mother in her early 20s, who is the \u201cpack leader\u2026 vivid, with a furious, and furiously channelled, confidence\u201d. There is intense camaraderie between these women, the kind of fierce mutual support that stems from people who find themselves in adverse \u2013 often terrifying \u2013 circumstances. And sometimes there is laughter too: \u201cI wonder what they will make of this full-throated, indecent, intemperate laughter. Our greatest gift to one another is this\u2026 we are drawn back into the folds of the unremarkable.\u201d The pages of Mother Ship are filled with love, anguish, despair and hope in the face of adversity. As a memoir, it is both insightful and moving; as a diary of 56 days in neonatal care, it is an exquisitely written paean to motherhood. \u2022 Mother Ship by Francesca Segal is published by Vintage (\u00a314.99).
