Twenty-three years and three sequels after the original, the sub-Alien sci-fi movie at last gets a proper follow-up, and even if Brody barely has the bulk to fill one of Schwarzenegger's combat boots, this serves up the semi-guilty action pleasures you'd demand. Brody is one of a gang of random human badasses who wind up in a strange jungle and realise they're now training material for apprentice alien badasses. So who will survive to be the, er, worst ass? The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (12A) (David Slade, 2010, US) Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner. 124 mins. Another teen-conquering exercise in sexless erotica, but at least there's an actual film around it this time. A new vampire threat and Bella's love triangle won't be enough to entice newcomers, but fans will enjoy the unconsummated fantasy thrills they crave. Leaving (15) (Catherine Corsini, 2009, Fra) Kristin Scott Thomas, Sergi L\u00f3pez, Yvan Attal. 86 mins. Scott Thomas's watchability and classy cinematography add a veneer of class to an otherwise straightforward portrait of a Lady Chatterley-ish affair. London River (12A) (Rachid Bouchareb, 2009, UK/Fra/Alg) Brenda Blethyn, Sotigui Kouyat\u00e9, Roschdy Zem. 88 mins. This understated drama has a tough time getting over its offputting premise: two parents \u2013 a British widow and a French-African Muslim \u2013 bond as they search for their children, who both went missing in the 7/7 attacks. Frownland (NC) (Ronald Bronstein, 2007, US) Dore Mann, Paul Grimstad. 106 mins. There's something kind of refreshing about this grimy, nervy, confrontational indie \u2013 a portrait of a manically neurotic New York man who's difficult to like or befriend. It's a love-or-hate kind of film, but not easily forgettable. Gangster's Paradise: Jerusalema (15) (Ralph Ziman, 2008, SA) Rapulana Seiphemo. 119 mins. Scarface comes to South Africa, but this potentially generic rise-of-the-hoodlum epic benefit from strong local flavours and some real-life credibility. Went The Day Well (PG) (Alberto Cavalcanti, 1942, UK) Leslie Banks, Mervyn Johns. 93 mins. British pluck to the fore in this rich wartime propaganda thriller, in which the Nazis cause a spot of bother by covertly invading an surreally archetypal English village. But Jerry's picked the wrong corner of Blighty \u2026 The 7th Dimension (15) (Brad Watson, 2009, UK) Kelly Adams, Lucy Evans, Jonathan Rhodes. 91 mins. Overambitious and underbudgeted paranormal/conspiracy thriller pitting a bedsit of computer hackers against the Vatican's secret codes and psychic spies. Milenge Milenge (NC) (Satish Kaushik, 2010, Ind) Kareena Kapoor, Shahid Kapoor. 150 mins. Bollywood romcom of chance encounters loosely based on Serendipity. Out from Friday Bluebeard Catherine Breillat's surprisingly unconfrontational take on the fairytale ladykiller. Inception Leonardo DiCaprio leads a sci-fi thriller set in the windmills of your mind. With Tom Hardy and Ellen Page. Mega Piranha Big-toothed big fish disaster nonsense with a cheese filling. The Concert Feelgood French movie involving a fake orchestra. Starring M\u00e9lanie Laurent. Rapt Up-to-date French portrayal of a political kidnapping. Rough Aunties Sundance-winning documentary on a pioneering South African child protection group.
