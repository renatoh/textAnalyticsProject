The charity commission announced that it would make permanent the ban on Mr Hamza following an investigation into his role as imam at the North London Central mosque in Finsbury Park. Mr Hamza has three months to challenge the decision in the high court, but his lawyer says this is unlikely as he lacks the money. If he flouts the ban, as he has vowed, he could be removed by force. Last month police stormed the mosque claiming they were looking for evidence of terrorist activity. The mosque has been closed ever since after police handed it back to the trustees of the charity which legally controls the mosque. It is believed that they also want to oust Mr Hamza. The charity commission said its decision was \"to protect the charity and its future administration\" and that its intervention was necessary because \"the trustees of the charity had been prevented from governing the charity properly by the activities of Abu Hamza and his supporters\". It suspended Mr Hamza in April, but he flouted the order and continued preaching. In December the commission announced that a succession of statements by Mr Hamza were of \"such an extreme and political nature as to conflict\" with the charitable status the mosque enjoys. Mr Hamza is listed as an agent of the charity. A raging battle has been fought for control of the mosque, which has gained notoriety since Mr Hamza started preaching there. Some of the 800 to 1,000 who attended the Friday sermons where he preached condemned his message as being anti-American and anti-semitic; some say he is one of the few imams in Britain preaching the truth. John Stoker, chief charity commissioner, said: \"The action we have taken today enables the trustees of the mosque to govern the charity so that it can do the important work for which it was originally established.\" A commission spokesman, Antony Robbins, said: \"We have instructed him that he has been removed as an agent of the charity and issued an order for him to cease to act as an agent of the charity and we hope he will observe the order. \"What we want to do is to restore the charity to the trust-ees. We want the trustees to run the charity again, as compared to the undue influence Mr Hamza has had on them.\" Muddassar Arani, Mr Hamza's solicitor, said the cleric would defy the ban: \"This is not a surprise. He won't appeal as he hasn't got money to fight this in the courts. He will still attend the mosque regardless of what the charity commission say. Any Muslim is allowed to enter the mosque and they should not be prevented from doing so as it is a place of worship. The charity commission is overriding the wishes of the worshippers.\" Mr Hamza has a history of controversy which has dismayed some Muslims, who say he tarnishes the reputation of their faith. They also say the media focuses on his extreme statements at the expense of more moderate and mainstream Islamic voices. On Monday he called the space shuttle disaster a \"divine act, a message for mankind\". On the first anniversary of September 11 he staged an event in the mosque called \"A towering day in history\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
