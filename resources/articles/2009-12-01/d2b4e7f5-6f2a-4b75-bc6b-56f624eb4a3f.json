Mohammed Mrabet Fahsi, 40, telephoned his wife, Khadija Podd, to tell her he was \"in the street\", Spanish jargon for release from prison. \"They've let me go, they've let me go!\" he told her. \"It was like a dream, it just wouldn't sink in, the news we've been waiting for four years,\" said Podd, celebrating at home in Nottingham with their children aged 11, 9 and six. Fahsi, a Moroccan-born British resident, was held under the controversial \"incommunicado\" regime after his arrest near Barcelona. His case was highlighted by an Amnesty International campaign against unfair detention in Spain. His trial for belonging to a terrorist group started in September and the verdict was being considered when the authorities released him on Friday without even notifying his lawyer. Fahsi had been jailed for more than three years without being charged. Podd and the children plan to fly out to Barcelona on Christmas Eve. Fahsi, who was in the process of moving to Nottingham, was arrested in Vilanova y la Geltr\u00fa, near Barcelona, in 2006. He was detained for almost five days incommunicado. Under Spanish law terrorist suspects can be held for up to 13 days without contacting their family, lawyer or doctor. The Spanish prosecution accused him of indoctrinating another man who was later involved in a bomb attack on Italian troops in Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
