America by Dunya Mikhail Translated by Liz Winslow please don't ask me, America I don't remember on which street with whom or under which star Don't ask me I don't remember the colours of the people or their signatures I don't remember if they had our faces and our dreams if they were singing or not writing from the left or right or not writing at all sleeping in houses on sidewalks or in airports making love or not making love Please don't ask me, America I don't remember their names or their birthplaces People are grass They are born everywhere, America Don't ask me . . . I don't remember what time it was or what kind of weather language or flag Don't ask me . . . I don't remember how long they walked under the sun or how many died I don't remember the shapes of the boats or the number of ports . . . how many suitcases they carried or left behind if they came complaining or without complaint Stop your questioning, America and offer your hand to the tired on the other shore Offer it without questions or waiting lists What good is it to gain the whole world if you lose the Soul, America? Who said that the sky would lose all of its stars if night passed without answers? America, leave your questionnaires to the river and leave me to my lover It has been a long time we are two distant, rippling shores and the river wriggles between us \"like a well-cooked fish\" It has been a long time, America (longer than the stories of my grandmother in the evening) and we are waiting for the signal to throw our shell in the river We know that the river is full of shells; this last one wouldn't matter yet it matters to the shell Why do you ask all these questions? You want our fingerprints in all languages and I have become old older than my father He used to tell me in the evenings when no trains ran: One day, we will go to America, One day, we will go and sing a song translated or not translated at the Statue of Liberty And now, America, now I came to you, without my father The dead ripen faster than the Indian figs but they never grow older, America They come in shifts of shadow and light in our dreams and as shooting stars or curve in rainbows over the houses we left behind They sometimes get angry if we keep them waiting a while . . . What time is it now? I am afraid I will receive your registered mail, America in this hour which has no usefulness so I would toy with the freedom like a domesticated cat I wouldn't know what else to do with it in this hour which has no usefulness . . . and my sweetheart there, on the opposite shore of the river carries a flower for me And I - as you know - dislike faded flowers I do like my sweetheart's handwriting shining each day in the mail I salvage it from among ad fliers and special offers Buy one Get One Free and an urgent promotional announcement: You will win a million dollars if you subscribe to this magazine! bills to be paid in monthly instalments I like my sweetheart's handwriting though it gets shakier every day We have a single picture just one picture, America I want it I want that moment forever out of reach in the picture which I know from every angle: the circular moment of sky Imagine, America: if one of us drops out of the picture and leaves the album full of loneliness or if life becomes a camera without film Imagine, America! Without a frame the night will take us tomorrow darling tomorrow the night will take us without a frame we will shake the museums forever from their sleep fix our broken clocks so we'll tick in the public squares whenever the train passes us by tomorrow darling tomorrow we will bloom: two leaves of a tree we will try not to be graceful in the greenness and in time we will tumble down like dancers taken by the wind to the places whose names we'll have forgotten we will be glad for the sake of the turtles because they persist along their way Tomorrow darling tomorrow I'll look at your eyes to see in your new wrinkles the lines of our future dreams As you will braid my gray hair under rain or sun or moon every hair will know that nothing happens twice every kiss a country with a history a geography and a language with joy and sadness with war and ruins and holidays and ticking clocks . . . And when the pain in your neck returns, darling You will not have time to complain and won't be concerned if it remains inside us coy as snow that won't melt Tomorrow, darling tomorrow from the wooden box will come the jingling sound of two rings: they have been shining for a long time on two trembling hands, entangled by the absence. Tomorrow the whiteness will expose all its colours as we welcome back what was lost or concealed in the whiteness How should I know, America which of the colours was the most joyful tumultuous alienated or assimilated of them all? How would I know, America? Dunya Mikhail was born in Baghdad in 1964. She now teaches Arabic in Detroit. **** In a magic land by Fadhil al-Azzawi Translated by Saadi A Simawe We have tales full of tragic knights, who descend upon burning horses from distant skies like meteors at night. We have many sleeping dinosaurs, which we have tied to rocks in green meadows full of singing birds. Then the world was just born, the gods were our neighbours, and we believed in wonders. One day, we went to help them in their work, but they unleashed all the bloody beasts upon us, slipped away down the valley and headed towards another magic land. What traitors! The Last Iraq by Fadhil al-Azzawi Translated by Salaam Yousif Every night I place this creature on my table And pull its ears, Till tears of joy come to its eyes. Another cold winter, penetrated by airplanes And soldiers sitting on the edge of a hillock, Waiting for history To rise up from the darkness of the marshes With a gun in its hand, To shoot angels Training for the revolution. Every night I put my hand on this country, It slips away from my fingers, Like a soldier running from the front. [1987] Fadhi al-Azzawi was born in Iraq's northern city of Kirkuk. He was imprisoned in Baghdad. He lives now in Germany. **** War Diaries by Sami Mahdi Translated by Ferial J Ghazoul I. (Feb 14, 1991) From gazelles' eyes the pupils dropped When the bridge was bombed Lovers' rings shattered And mothers were bewildered II. (Feb. 16, 1991) With fire we perform our ablutions every morning Collecting our remnants And the debris of our houses We purge our souls with the blood of our wounds III. (Feb 24, 1991) Plenty we have received What shall we offer you, O land of patient destitutes? Plenty we have receieved So receive us And pave with us the paths of wayfarers Sami Mahdi was born in 1940 and lives in Baghdad, where he works as editor-in-chief of the official Iraqi daily al-Thwara. **** Fratricide by Abdula Peshew Translated by Muhamad Tawfiq Ali In this damned country, what haven't you apportioned like your own farms? What used to make us proud was the memory of our martyrs you have turned into bridges for yourselves. I dare not carry a pen, I dare not wear a shirt as you have apportioned even the colours, damn you!* Is it student or pupil? Is it woman or lady?** You have divided even the words in the dictionary, damn you! You divided even the twin shores of the greats Khani and Haji Qadir.*** You divided even the natural elements of earth, water and fire. What have you done? Whom have you spared? You have apportioned even prostitutes, thieves and robbers. You have divided one homeland into two. Roaming town by town, village by village, You have divided the hearth of each home into two. Other people have one common history, we have two. Other people are lumbered with one leadership, we are lumbered with two. Is there anybody who has not heard of Ba'th? Is there anybody who does not know Ba'th? Until recently, he was a ruthless thug, a bloodthirsty murderer. Now, thanks to you, he is back with a vengeance, Incognito like a secret agent, invisible like death. He has turned into TNT explosive. He is disguised among the wads of our Dinar notes. He has infiltrated our dining table, Clinging to us by the feet, he follows us everywhere. In the headlines of your newspapers, I see Ba'th. In the cabinet posts of your leaders, I see Ba'th. In the 50/50 power sharing, I see Ba'th. In the killing of prisoners and extractions of confessions, I see Ba'th. In the ringing of the bell and the knock on the door at midnight, I see Ba'th. Thanks to you, one of my eyes is dancing with joy because the other eye is unsightly. Thanks to you, one of my arteries is hysterical with laughter at the severance of its fraternal artery. In my occupied hometown, I see the turban on the head of the partisans which for years looked like a crown. Now, thanks to you, it almost resembles the helmet of a soldier. Two dead bodies lie there, brothers they were. They shared the same dream, but they differed in colour. The distance between them is bridged by the burning sighs of a mother and father. As for their leaders, they are enjoying themselves in merriment and mirth. The gap between them is bridged by the enemy's dining tables with glasses of wine. Abdula Peshew is a contemporary of the first generation of the followers of the modernist Kurdish poet, Goran.
