She is a personal injury lawyer. I am not. I have been a criminal defence solicitor for 25 years and find her comment grossly insulting. She demonstrates massive ignorance of how criminal defence is funded, both for solicitors and the criminal bar. The vast majority of work we do is publicly funded. Despite being paid a fixed fee for a crown court case of any kind \u2013 yes, even a murder case \u2013 we have one goal: to represent our client's interests fearlessly and to the best of our ability. To suggest otherwise is to belittle the hard work, long hours and dedication to achieving the best outcome for our clients that is at the heart of the work we do. The government is intent on reducing the number of firms practising criminal law in an attempt to save money, while convincing the public that the quality of service they receive will remain as high. They are right, it will, because those of us who believe that everyone accused of a crime has a right to be represented by a highly motivated specialist lawyer are not in it for the money.
