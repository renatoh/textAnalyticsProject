Easter is taken very seriously in Seville with spectacular processions of rival church brotherhoods, followed by penitents, eerily clad in tall pointed hoods. The April Feria kicks off a summer of high-octane flamenco festivals with hard dancing, hard drinking and round the clock partying in casetas (tents) lining the city's streets. In Valencia, the week leading up to March 19 sees bonfires illuminating every street corner, in the name of Las Fallas. Originally for woodworkers to dispose of their shavings, the festival has latterly developed into a crazed celebration of pyrotechnics, where enormous papier-mch\u00e9 effigies are drunkenly paraded through the streets before being noisily cremated. Also putting the spotlight on Valencia is Europe's largest science museum, which recently opened its quirkily-designed doors after investments of \u00a3149m. Further north, Bilbao never really made it on to the tourist map until the opening of the funky modern-art museum, but Frank Gehry's titanium-clad Guggenheim is just part of a major pro gramme of urban renewal. British Airways Holidays (0870 2424243, www.baholidays.co.uk) has two-night packages to Seville during April from \u00a3289pp, including return flights. BA also flies direct to Valencia and Bilbao (flight only; 0845 7733377, www.britishairways.com. * Exodus is offering two new high-adrenalin holidays in the mountains of the north-east. In the Picos de Europa national park, you can try canoeing, caving, biking and canyoning. Or head further east to the Pyrenees for dog-sled safaris, snow-shoeing and paragliding on skis. More tranquil mountain retreats, are to be found in the \"pueblos blancos\", whitewashed villages that punctuate the hillside sweeping back from the Costa del Sol. Individual Travellers Spain has a range of traditional self-catering properties, from pueblo-style houses to stately haciendas. The Doll's House in Gaucin, high in the Serra nia de Ronda, is down a tiny alleyway, overlooking cork-oak woods and olive groves. Exodus (020-8675 5550, www.exodustravels.co.uk) offers the above eight-day tours from \u00a3595 and \u00a3647 respectively, including all accommodation, activities, transport and return flights. A local payment of around \u00a380 covers most meals.

Can't sail? No matter, because The Moorings has skippered yachts in the Balearics ranging from 32ft-50ft. Ibiza itself has some beautiful secluded bays, especially around the north of the island, and the wide, sandy beaches of Formentera are just a gust of wind away. Simply Spain offers high-quality accommodation in fincas, paradores and working farms in out-of-the-way locations. Additions to this year's programme are Lanzarote and Menorca. Simply Spain (020-8541 2277, www.simply-travel.com).

Flights not included. * \"Catalans first, Spaniards second\" is the maxim of proud residents of Catalonia. And this distinct character is represented wholeheartedly in regional cuisine. With moun tains on one side and the Mediterranean on the other, expect dishes where lobster and chicken, or meat and snails sit happily side by side. Based at the Michelin-starred Casa Irene restaurant, in the Hotel Valarties, guests will learn how to prepare Catalan specialities and take picnic lunch excursions to sample their fare, plus a gastronomic dinner at the restaurant.

Those less confident should choose one riding centre and ride out daily - and these centres are often better for families and non-riding partners. There is excellent year-round riding in the Andalucian mountains, Catalonia and the Aragon Pyrenees. New this year from riding specialist Inntravel ( 01653 629010, www inntravel.co.uk) is The High Aragon Trail in the Sierra de Guara in the foothills of the Pyrenees.
