The power of the genre lies in the longing, so it\u2019s most effective when heard in a landlocked location a million miles away from the nearest marina. Since aspiration crosses class, it doesn\u2019t matter whether one\u2019s home turf is the country club or a trailer park: listening to this song has the same effect \u2013 it nurses that ache for freedom. The Doobie Brothers: What a Fool Believes (1979) A YR hallmark is \u201cupbeat-downbeat\u201d: an approach that folds life\u2019s bittersweet complexities within happy-snappy musical flourishes. A great example of upbeat-downbeat is this Doobie Brothers classic, showcasing the misplaced optimism of a wounded romantic. Singer Michael McDonald is in full fuzzy-throated throttle. Those are his BVs on Ride Like the Wind, and on any number of Steely Dan tracks, including \u2026 Steely Dan: Hey Nineteen (1980) The frisson of yacht rock derives from its blend of bourgie feelgood bounce crossed with a shiver of thwarted desire. Steely Dan self-deprecatingly called their work \u201cfunked-up muzak\u201d but, lyrically, there are none more acidic than these egghead jazzbos with tales of grown-up screw-ups. Thanks to LA\u2019s session musician elite, Hey Nineteen is polished to a sheen, but the narrator\u2019s regretful realisation that he is too old to mack on teenage girls makes for uneasy listening. Joni Mitchell: The Hissing of Summer Lawns (1975) Generally, female musicians didn\u2019t focus their talents on the yacht genre: its palette was too limiting for the era\u2019s sophisticated female artists beyond a song or two. In 1975, Mitchell made what\u2019s considered \u201caccidental yacht rock\u201d. This chilly saga of tarnished love concerns a woman trapped in a big house and a loveless marriage. Mitchell made the misery of rich people seem glamorous, creating \u201cdark yacht\u201d in the process. Toto: Africa (1982) By the time the 1980s rolled around, black musicians had reclaimed the surging soul and quiet storm of yacht that was rightfully theirs. Artists such as George Benson, Lionel Richie and Raydio raised the bar by turning this \u201cfunked-up muzak\u201d into a dance party. Ironically, an anthem called Africa turned out to be helmed by a clump of the whitest dudes going. With its questing lyrics and triumphant chorus, it became a blockbuster smash for the ages, proving that yacht rock is for ever.
