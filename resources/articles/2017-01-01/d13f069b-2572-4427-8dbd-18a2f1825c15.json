Liverpool are the closest challengers to Antonio Conte\u2019s side having moved four points ahead of City with a hard-fought win at Anfield on New Year\u2019s Eve. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team, who remain six points behind the leaders, kick off at struggling Sunderland less than 44 hours after the conclusion of the City match and may be without their captain, Jordan Henderson, as well as the confirmed absentees Philippe Coutinho and Jo\u00ebl Matip. Henderson was withdrawn with a heel injury against Pep Guardiola\u2019s team, although it is not the same heel that sidelined the midfielder for sustained spells last season. Chelsea do not play until Wednesday\u2019s awkward assignment at Tottenham Hotspur and Wijnaldum, who secured Liverpool\u2019s win over City with an outstanding header, believes Sunderland is an opportunity for Klopp\u2019s team to pressure the leaders by cutting the gap to three points. The Holland international said: \u201cYou always have to put pressure on an opponent. We just have to win the game. Will it put pressure on them? I don\u2019t know, maybe. Sunderland is a tough game as they also want to win because of the threat of relegation. Chelsea are flying right now and doing great but we have to focus on our own game and we will see if we come closer but the main thing is to keep doing what we are doing now, win our own games and not look at Chelsea because we don\u2019t control that performance. \u201cWe have to give 100% and show how good we are. We can go far but we have to show it game by game. It is going well now but we don\u2019t know how it will be going in two months so we must make sure we go all the time.\u201d Klopp said it must be \u201cannoying\u201d for Chelsea to have won 13 league games in succession and find Liverpool still on their coat-tails, and Wijnaldum credited the manager for instilling in his players the belief to beat Guardiola\u2019s expensively assembled side. \u201cHe just gives us confidence. In my opinion he does not do a lot special, just gives us the confidence we need, the confidence in our own quality and that we are a good team,\u201d the midfielder explained. \u201cHe spoke in the team meeting and said, \u2018We have to show our quality and show them how good you are.\u2019 \u201cI was not here before Klopp came so I can\u2019t give my opinion on how the football has changed but in my opinion it is great to work under the manager. He gives players a happy feeling to play for Liverpool. What he wants is that we have joy in the things we do \u2013 training, games \u2013 and that is important for a footballer.\u201d Wijnaldum also claimed Quincy Promes, his international team-mate, would succeed at Liverpool should Klopp develop his interest in the Spartak Moscow midfielder this month. \u201cI think he knows how great Liverpool is, I knew it before I came here,\u201d said the summer recruit from Newcastle United. \u201cI don\u2019t know if everything is true about what they say as I don\u2019t speak with him about that. Of course I want him to come to Liverpool because I know he is a good player and also a good person who can help the team but it is something for the manager and the scouts, not for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
