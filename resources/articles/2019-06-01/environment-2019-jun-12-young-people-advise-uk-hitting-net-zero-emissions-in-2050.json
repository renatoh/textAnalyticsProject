The commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions was described as \u201chistoric\u201d by leading figures. But the UK is not yet on track to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals, so a huge transformation of energy, transport and buildings is urgently required. Thirty young people, aged 15-24, will assess how this should be done, starting in July. They will present their recommendations to ministers after the summer. The Youth Steering Group was founded in February to provide perspectives on all issues and has now been tasked with examining the climate, wildlife and plastic crises. Young people striking from school in the UK and around the world have pushed public concern over the climate emergency to record levels. Following the visit in April by the first school striker, Greta Thunberg, the environment has risen to third in the public\u2019s concerns, with only Brexit and health ranked higher. Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, the chair of the British Youth Council, the charity hosting the Youth Steering Group, said: \u201cYoung people are both the custodians and the inheritors of the natural world. We are proud to be working with the government to assess progress, and set out our views on the priorities for environmental protection and conservation.\u201d Izzy Warren of the UK Student Climate Network, which helps coordinate the school strikes, said: \u201c[We] have undoubtedly played an integral role in pressuring the government to act. However, the legislation and target year for 2050 is severely lacking in ambition and disregards any sense of climate justice. Simply put, it\u2019s too late.\u201d The government followed the guidance of its official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), in setting the 2050 date, but others argue it should be sooner. Clara Goldsmith at the Climate Coalition said: \u201cThe past 10 years have shown incredible cost reductions in clean technologies, so we firmly believe the UK can go even further, driving innovation to reach net zero before 2045.\u201d Prof Mark Maslin of University College London said acting sooner would create more green jobs: \u201cWe must adopt a 2030 zero carbon target.\u201d The government did not accept the CCC\u2019s advice that the net zero target for 2050 should be met solely by cutting emissions in the UK, and not buying carbon offsets from abroad. A government spokesperson said the option of offsets was \u201ca sensible contingency that we don\u2019t intend to use\u201d and might help reduce the cost of cutting emissions. Alison Doig at Christian Aid said this was very disappointing. \u201cIt is vital the government emissions reductions are not merely outsourced through dodgy loopholes. Otherwise this target will end up as state-sponsored greenwashing,\u201d she said. However, the CCC gave a more sanguine reaction, while emphasising that meeting the 2050 target by cutting domestic emissions was preferable and entirely possible. Chris Stark, the CCC chief executive, said: \u201cIf the world is addressing climate change as it must, then by mid-century, when we really need these credits, they will be very expensive because every country in the world will be demanding them. But I don\u2019t feel I can be overly critical of the government if they want to try and make them work [as a contingency].\u201d. The UK government\u2019s net zero target was hailed as \u201chistoric\u201d by both Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate deal, and Lord Nicholas Stern at the London School of Economics. Stern led a landmark 2006 review of the economics of climate change, which concluded: \u201cThe benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting.\u201d The chancellor, Philip Hammond, had told the prime minister the costs of the meeting the net zero target could be \u00a31tn over 30 years, but was widely criticised as having failed to factor in the benefits. Stern said: \u201cThe Treasury should recognise that the significant investments required for the zero-carbon transition will yield very substantial economic returns, such as reductions in air pollution and greater energy efficiency, as well as the avoided impacts of dangerous climate change. \u201cThis is a very attractive path of inclusive and clean growth with great advantages nationally and internationally for the UK.\u201d The prime minister said there would be a review of the net zero target in five years \u201cto confirm other countries are taking similarly ambitious action and ensuring that our industries do not face unfair competition\u201d, a move seen as a concession to Hammond. But Stern said the review was unfortunate: \u201cThis could create uncertainty for businesses, ultimately making the transition more expensive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
