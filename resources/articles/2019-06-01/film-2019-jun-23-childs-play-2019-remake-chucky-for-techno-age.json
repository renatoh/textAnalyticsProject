In the original Child\u2019s Play, the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray animated the murderous doll; in this version, a beleaguered factory worker in Vietnam deliberately removes the safety protocols and violence prohibitors of a \u201cBuddi\u201d doll after being fired by the fictional Kaslan corporation. Like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri, Buddi is an artificially intelligent, voice-controlled toy, designed to sync with all Kaslan products; immediately, the film seems to warn against technological integration, lest our devices turn on us. The tampered-with Buddi (who goes by the name of Chucky and is voiced by Mark Hamill) ends up in the arms of Gabriel Bateman\u2019s lonely pre-teen Andy (it\u2019s not lost on me that he shares the name with the custodian of another famous talking toy). \u201cI am your best friend, I am your Buddi,\u201d he coos and he is; the two develop a prankish relationship until Chucky picks up a few ideas while watching a horror movie marathon. There are some gory moments (a man\u2019s leg is sliced, the flesh falling off like meat from a rotisserie, and a sleazy character has a grisly encounter with a lawnmower), but the film extracts more laughs than genuine scares."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
