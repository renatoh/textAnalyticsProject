But don't expect tears from the eventual runner-up, as there is always next year. Unusually, all of the leading contenders in this year's title race are likely to remain eligible to compete as apprentices in 2011. Sullivan and Brennan, as well as their nearest pursuers, should begin next year's Flat season under the threshold of 95 career winners that triggers the loss of the apprentice status and the weight allowance that goes with it. For a young jockey, chasing success while also satisfying the needs of an employer can be an exhausting business. Yesterday, Sullivan rode seven lots of exercise work for Mick Easterby from 6am to 12.30pm before jumping into a car with Brennan (\"there's always a good bit of banter between us, he really wants the championship too\") for the trip south. There is only mutual respect between Sullivan and his boss, who despite a reputation for blunt speaking, has offered nothing but praise for the 23-year-old's riding abilities and work ethic. Sullivan arrived at Easterby's North Yorkshire yard two years ago, in hope rather than expectation. \"It had been running through my head for a while to give England a go,\" he said. \"I'd ridden a few winners in Ireland but it wasn't really getting off the ground. \"I didn't really know much about Mick to be honest. I mean, I'd heard of him. But you just have to take a chance sometimes. \"I get on with him very well, though. He's teaching me a lot, you know? When I came over, I wasn't that good at speaking. He got on to me about that. He said: 'You'll have to learn to talk, because you're too quiet for your own good'. He's given me confidence and I've just gone from strength to strength with his help. \"Thanks to my agent, I've had rides for a lot of trainers this year. I try and ring every trainer after the race and tell them as much as I can about the horses that I've ridden, thank them for the ride and hopefully they'll decide to use me again.\" Despite spending much of his early teens in County Westmeath on horseback, in pursuit of his developing passion for the pony club, Sullivan came into racing with little knowledge of the sport. \"My mother said that maybe if I went to RACE [the Irish Racing School] for a year when I was 16, I could go back to school afterwards, but I just kept going at it,\" Sullivan recalled. \"Now I read the form every day, I try and figure out what's going to happen. You want to know where the speed is going to come from and how the race is going to work out. I didn't really understand how important that sort of thing is. \"I used to watch Mick Kinane in the weighing room, sat in the corner with his head in the paper. Paul Hanagan's the same. He knows the form inside out.\" Sullivan gets a day off every other Sunday. \"I ride out almost every day and that helps keep my weight under control. I do 8st or 8st 1lb on the scales most mornings but if you ride a few lots you can lose 2lb or 3lb. I love keeping busy, though. \"When times are hard, when you're trying to get rides and that, sometimes when things aren't going right it is very easy to say: 'This game's not for me'. But I really try to work as hard as I can and turn it around. You make your own luck.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
