Zidane took France to victory in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, and has been named world player of the year three times. His departure had been widely anticipated by the French press. \"It wasn't a shock. Just the confirmation of bad news,\" L'Est Republicain remarked. \"The world won't stop turning just because a great footballer has definitively given up the blue shirt. But we'll have to get used to his absence,\" the paper continued. \"We miss Zidane already.\" Several papers wrote about Zidane's retirement as if they were responding to the death of an icon. \"For millions of his fans, this marks the beginning of a period of mourning,\" declared Alain Constant in Le Monde . \"France has lost a national hero\" and a \"living legend\", lamented Le Figaro in similarly eulogistic style. The regional La Provence was keen to remind its readers that Zidane was a local, claiming the midfielder as a \"child of Marseille\". The paper touched upon his background as the son of Algerian immigrants and pointed to the contributions he has made outside the world of football. \"Zidane still lives in a country that strives to integrate populations that have come from overseas,\" it said. \"Perhaps despite himself, he has embodied dreams that go beyond football alone. And for that too we thank him.\" Lib\u00e9ration's Patrick Sabatier described Zidane's \"farewell\" as being \"as widely anticipated as a presidential address on the future of France\". Sabatier reckoned that the reason the French were so able to take him into their hearts was due to his \"enigmatic\" personality, which his admirers could \"sculpt as they please to use him for their own ends\". \"A great champion must also take care over how he exits,\" judged L'Equipe. The sports daily concluded that Zidane's decision was good for the game: \"[He] will no longer be the eternal safety net. It's better like this, for him as much as for the new selectioner,\" it said. Whatever happens to France's international game, Zidane will remain \"the best present that the French team has ever received.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
