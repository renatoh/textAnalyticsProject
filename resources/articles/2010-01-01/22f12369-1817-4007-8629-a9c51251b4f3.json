The FIA indicated that it will appeal against the judges' ruling in favour of the former head of Renault's Formula One team. Briatore reacted to his victory by opening the door to a sensational comeback but the FIA later suggested it would attempt to amend its rule book to keep him out and noted he remains banned until its appeal options have been exhausted. The governing body said it \"intends to consider appropriate actions to ensure that no persons who would engage, or who have engaged, in such dangerous activities or acts of intentional cheating will be allowed to participate in Formula One in the future\". Briatore was excluded from participation in all forms of international motorsport for his part in fixing the outcome of the 2008 Singapore grand prix, during which Nelson Piquet Jr was told to crash into a wall in order to improve the chances of his team-mate Fernando Alonso. A French court today found that the FIA did not have the power to impose such a penalty and suggested there was a conflict of interest due to Max Mosley, the then president of the FIA, already being in dispute with Briatore. \"Let me take a little time to enjoy this moment of happiness after this difficult period,\" Briatore told Autosport.com, refusing to be drawn on when or whether he might return to the sport where he won championships with Benetton and Renault in a career spanning more than two decades. \"As concerns my possible return to F1, there is plenty of time to talk about this.\" The former Renault team principal, who also owns a majority stake in Queens Park Rangers, expressed \"great joy\" at the verdict and said it had been a \"difficult decision\" to take the case to the French civil courts but he had no other choice. \"The decision handed down today restores to me [my] dignity,\" he said. Briatore could not literally be banned as team principals do not hold licences but the FIA had forbidden all its licence holders from dealing with Briatore last September. Pat Symonds, Renault's former technical chief, also had his five-year ban lifted. Briatore had sought damages of \u20ac1m (\u00a3890,000) but was awarded \u20ac15,000 in compensation as well as Italian fails asking that the sentence be lifted. Symonds was awarded \u20ac5,000. \"It is almost exactly what we had asked for, this is obviously an exceptional outcome for Mr Briatore,\" his lawyer Philippe Ouakrat said. Ouakrat claimed that the judgment was \"extraordinary\" and could have serious implications for the future of the FIA. He said it was not a question of the length of the ban or the fact that it limited Briatore's ability to earn a living but simply \"an issue of fair justice\". Ouakrat believed it would be \"very difficult\" for the FIA to win an appeal. \"I think the decision is very well-structured. It is going to be very difficult for the FIA to appeal against it. It's a great feeling to see that everything you say is considered right by the court.\" He said there remained \"a door open\" for further legal action. In its judgment, the court said: \"The FIA ... can sanction licence holders, leaders, members of the ASNs [national sporting authorities], but it cannot with respect to third parties take measures equivalent to a sanction. The [FIA] World Council, by forbidding FIA members and licensees to work with Messrs Briatore and Symonds, on the one hand added a negative condition \u2013 to not work with them \u2013 which is not provided for within the FIA statutes.\" The judgment added: \"The decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president, who was well known to be in conflict with Briatore, with Mr Mosley having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies.\" Attempts to contact Mosley tonight failed. The panel of three judges noted that Briatore had been summoned via an email only three days before the FIA hearing, had not been told why he had been charged and that the governing body had not sent him any documents regarding the scandal. Had the ban been upheld, Briatore could have been forced out of Queens Park Rangers under Football League fit and proper person rules, which prevent anyone who has been banned by another sports governing body from owning a club. The verdict will allow Briatore to continue managing the Formula One drivers Mark Webber and Heikki Kovalainen and, in theory, could led to his return to the pit lane. Briatore will not return to Renault, the Anglo-French team today announcing his full-time replacement. Eric Boullier, a 36-year-old Frenchman with no F1 experience, is as different from Briatore as it is possible to be. Briatore specialised in the commercial aspects of F1 and knew nothing about the technical side. Boullier's extensive background in the junior formulae, including GP2 and A1GP, focused on engineering and team management. Boullier's appointment allows Bob Bell, the temporary team principal, to return to his role as full-time technical director at Renault F1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
