But Rahul Dravid had it right. The greater test is yet to come. After overcoming India - a side whose World Cup challenge, lest we forget, had been even more calamitous - England flew from Heathrow last night for the Twenty20 World Championship in good heart. It is in South Africa, and in the one-day series in Sri Lanka to follow, that we will learn more about their adaptability. Dravid's captaincy of India is a port in a perpetual storm. He observes India's lurching overreaction to success and failure with equanimity. After England's untroubled seven-wicket win at Lord's, helped on its way by Aleem Dar's error in imagining that Andrew Flintoff had found Sachin Tendulkar's outside edge, Dravid shrugged off an honest mistake while others hankered after a public flogging. It was therefore a cool assessment, not born of any reluctance to offer praise where it was due, when he said: \"England played some very good cricket but the kind of team they had was well suited to these conditions. The kind of impact that these players can have in different conditions may be very different. It will be a challenge for them to do well in Sri Lanka.\" England have at least repaired their reputation in these islands, where until their capitulation against Sri Lanka last summer, they have generally been competitive. To finish the series with two pinch-hitting openers in Matt Prior and Luke Wright might have failed entirely - both made nought - but at least it was a statement that the chary tactics of the World Cup, when England spoke of \"steady starts\", had been abandoned, even in a series decider. To extend that success overseas, however, Flintoff's presence as third seamer is paramount, as is Monty Panesar's willingness to bowl enterprising, attacking one-day spells, and not just try to get through his overs with minimal damage - he needs to look at the wickets tally, not just the runs. Ravi Bopara, wristy and inventive, will insist that when he regains fitness he will meet the challenge; no one knows how Wright will fare. In time, on the subcontinent, England may also need Yorkshire's batsman/leg-spinner, Adil Rashid, although judging by Yorkshire's misconceived refusal to allow him to collect his Cricket Writer's Club young player of the year award in London on Friday night, they are in no rush for anybody to find out where he lives. Dravid's judgement was more considered than that of Kevin Pietersen, whose man-of-the-match award for an unbeaten 71, first one-day series win for England, and impending return to the country of his birth encouraged heady talk of new eras. Dravid was Radio 4, Pietersen MTV; click to your channel of choice. If it is galling for Tendulkar that he has never made a fifty for India at Lord's - and like Dravid and Sourav Ganguly he may never return - for the MCC members it must smack of a social lapse. Had it been anyone other than Flintoff that dismissed him so fortuitously, the pavilion might have given way to an unseemly groan or two. But Flintoff claimed precedence - England's great adventurer defiantly claiming his place in the Twenty20 jamboree, ankle full of cortisone and heavily strapped, refusing to grimace at any discomfort in case it was replayed on the big screen. Pietersen's man-of-the-match award was fortunate - it should have gone to James Anderson, whose aggressive new-ball spell on a sound batting surface set the tone - but his careful 71, from 96 balls, refused to yield to the shock of his second run-out incident in successive matches. At The Oval, he ran himself out when Owais Shah refused to be forced into a second run; here he ran out Ian Bell with a stop-start routine that left Bell, face down in the dirt and looking back at him with an expression of incredulity. Bell averaged 70 in the series, now neat of thought as well as stroke, and rightly was named man of the series; Pietersen is accepted as England's greatest batting talent, but they run together with perpetual mistrust. Anderson has been a revelation. Gone is the shyness of his early years; gone, too, thankfully, is an inappropriate snarly phase when he made misguided attempts to toughen up. Now he leads the attack impressively, his whippy action capable again of late swing, and increasingly possessing a shorter, rising delivery that can challenge the best of batsmen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
