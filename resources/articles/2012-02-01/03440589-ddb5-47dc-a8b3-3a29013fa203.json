Redknapp ruled out the possibility of taking the England role in a part-time capacity, describing it as \"impossible\", though he does believe that a job-share could work in the short term. That raises the possibility that Redknapp could be open to the idea of taking the job in this summer's European Championship in Poland and Ukraine before resuming his work at White Hart Lane. \"I think in the short term maybe it's possible for a European Championship but in the long term it's not possible to manage a club team and manage a national team,\" Redknapp said. \"It's so difficult. It's a full-time job. It's difficult enough managing in the Premier League without having to worry about managing the England team as well. You want to be watching the England players play, you want to be watching the opposition. Whoever they give the job to could do only the one job. \"Maybe for the Euros it is not such a problem but once they are finished and the new season starts in England, then the manager has to either be a Premier League manager, if he [already] manages in the Premier League, or the England manager. To do the two jobs would be impossible.\" Redknapp, cleared last week of cheating the public revenue after a two-and-a-half week trial at Southwark Crown Court, is still waiting to hear from the FA a week after the chairman, David Bernstein, began the process of finding Capello's successor. Those talks have continued this week in the form of a series of meetings to establish a shortlist, back-up options and the kind of salary and compensation package that the FA would be able to afford. Redknapp has always been uppermost in the FA's thoughts.\"I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't the popular choice,\" Redknapp told Abu Dhabi Sports. \"I know I am. It's been in every paper every day. But it's not easy. I have a good job, I work with good people, I have a good team and the fans have been fantastic to me. So just to walk away now when we're in such a good position wouldn't be fair on Tottenham.\" He added: \"I have to keep focusing on Tottenham. This week we have Stevenage in the [FA] Cup, then we have Arsenal, then we have Manchester United, then we have Chelsea. We have some fantastic games. It's an important time for me with Tottenham.\" Stuart Pearce, England's temporary manager, will hold a press conference next Thursday to name his squad for what will almost certainly be his only game in charge, the friendly with Holland at Wembley on 29 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
