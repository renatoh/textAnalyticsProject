The bodies of 49-year-old Jitendra Lad, his wife, 44-year-old Duksha, and their two daughters, Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 17, were found on Monday night at their home in Clayton, a suburb three miles west of Bradford city centre. It is believed that Jitendra hanged himself, but a postmortem examination will soon officially confirm how all four family members died. West Yorkshire police said detectives believed the family had died some days before they were discovered by neighbours, who were concerned they had not been seen for a while. No one is being sought in connection with the killings. Both parents worked for Bradford council: Jitendra as a control and payment specialist, and Duksha as an officer overseeing school appeals. Trisha was in her second year studying biochemistry at the University of Leeds and Nisha was in the sixth form at nearby Thornton grammar. The family were well regarded locally, according to a neighbour, Barry Hawkin, who said he last saw Jitendra on Friday. \u201cThey were a lovely couple and the kids were lovely. Well mannered,\u201d he said. Jitendra was a keen scuba diver. Earlier this year, he posted a photograph of himself wearing his diving gear on Facebook, with the caption: \u201cFinally qualified as an ocean diver.\u201d His diving club, the Guiseley sub-aqua club, declined to comment on Tuesday. Brought up in Bradford, he attended Grange technology college, according to his Facebook profile. The couple\u2019s colleagues at Bradford council were said to be in shock. Councillor Ralph Berry, lead member for children, said he knew Duksha. \u201cWe are totally shocked at the tragic loss of a respected officer,\u201d he said. After the news broke on Tuesday morning, a stream of tearful teenagers arrived at the detached house to leave floral tributes to the two girls. Neighbours said they could not understand how such a thing could happen to what had seemed a normal, happy family. Carol Thirkill, a local councillor, said she knew the family by sight and that they had a good reputation. She described Clayton as a nice, quiet area. Melissa Taylor, president of the faculty of biological sciences society at Leeds University, said on Twitter: \u201cHeartbreaking to hear about the death of Trisha Lad, such a lovely, well-liked person. Rest in peace.\u201d Another friend, Steph Mapplebeck, wrote: \u201cTrisha Lad was one of the sweetest and kindest people I have met whilst studying at Leeds. What a heartbreaking loss. Rest in peace.\u201d Sinclair Belle, Trisha\u2019s form tutor for three years, said: \u201cIn each morning registration, for three years, Trisha Lad greeted me with a smile. She was one of the hardest working members of my form and for this reason she succeeded as a student. \u201cHowever, her genuine humanity is what stood out about her \u2013 a fact that seemed to be logically explained by the support and compassion of her parents. The Lads emanated warmth each time I met them, even after Trisha left for university, which makes their tragic passing even more heart-wrenching and unfathomable.\u201d Jessica Garside, 18, who went to Thornton grammar with Trisha, said of her schoolfriend: \u201cShe was a lovely person. Never bitchy, never said anything bad about anybody.\u201d Sehaj Singh, 19, said he had known Trisha for eight years and last saw her during freshers\u2019 week at the university. He said: \u201cShe was really nice. She was just one of those people who got on with things.\u201d . A spokesman for the University of Leeds said: \u201cThis is dreadful and shocking news and our thoughts are with Trisha\u2019s friends and loved ones.\u201d Chris Sampson, head of Thornton grammar school, said: \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by these tragic deaths. Our thoughts are with the family\u2019s relatives and friends. We will be helping the police with their inquiry in any way we can.\u201d David Green, the leader of Bradford Council, said: \u201cLocal people are shocked and saddened by the news of this terrible event and our sympathy goes out to the wider family, friends and neighbours of this family. The husband and wife of the family, Jitendra Lad and Duksha Lad, both worked for Bradford council and councillors and employees are very upset after hearing the dreadful news. \u201cObviously, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage as the investigation into how it happened is continuing, but we would urge anyone who may have any information about this tragedy to contact the police immediately.\u201d West Yorkshire police said: \u201cEarly indications suggest the bodies may have been in the property for some time. Postmortems will now be carried out to establish the cause of the deaths.\u201d Det Supt Simon Atkinson, from West Yorkshire police\u2019s protective services (crime), said: \u201cThis is clearly a significant incident, and our investigation will be thorough as we piece together the events that have led to the deaths of a local family. The investigation is at an early stage, and while I do not want to speculate around the circumstances leading to the deaths, I can confirm that we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.\u201d Superintendent Damien Miller, who leads neighbourhood policing across the Bradford District, said: \u201cClayton is a close knit community and I understand that local people will be understandably upset by what has taken place and I would like to reassure people there is no wider danger to members of the public. \u201cAdditional neighbourhood officers are in the area speaking to people and offering reassurance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
