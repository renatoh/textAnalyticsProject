For never before has a trailer's plot so accurately and succinctly described the plot of a movie. The entire plot. All of it. In under two and a half minutes. The whole thing couldn't be a clearer a guide to the contents of the entire movie if it was all printed in big letters in a thick cardboard special edition Dr Seuss book called \"CARS GO VROOM, CARS GO BOOM!!!\". It is the most easily collapsible trailer ever, designed to stun into happy slack-jawed awe anyone who likes movies that basically revolve around exploding cars, and stun into slack-jawed horror anyone who can't think of anything worse than watching basically this trailer on a loop for 90 minutes. The concept Joan Allen appears, blonde and icy - \"I created Death Race six years ago. I now have as many viewers as Super Bowl. The drivers are convicts and the rules are simple. There are no rules.\" She says, then: \"Win and get your freedom \u2026 Or die trying\" Which sounds a bit like a rule, to be honest. So there are rules, but only that one. There is some more exposition revolving around the fact that Joan, a prison warden, races cars full of convicts. Racing them to the death. Joan, Joan, Joan. Was the money THAT good? The hero In a canteen, prisoners are watching other prisoners, warily. \"Who's the new guy?\" Asks Ian McShane - or Lovejoy (to those who won't let him forget one series he was in 15 years ago). \"Jensen Aimes. He used to race for Nascar. They say he killed his wife,\" says the prisoner, as marvellously informative as incidental characters always happen to be. We see Jensen woken up on a kitchen floor by police, and seeing his dead wife and looking surprised. Jensen clearly didn't kill his wife, we are to understand. But other shots show us that he is a great driver, and an angry individual. And a cockney. Because he is Jason Statham. The love interest At one point, a crack squad of honeys arrive on a bus. \"These are the navigators,\" McShane's voiceover explains, sounding like a Jackanory storyteller, \"They've been busted out of the women's prison for the job.\" And some supermodels step off the bus shaking their shiny hair like a shampoo advert and their derrieres like they just don't care. Not sure what level of complex directorial research has gone into these female prisoners, but I'm guessing they never watched Prisoner Cell Block H. They're all a bit more \"Milan fashion week\" than \"crack-addled sex worker\" to be honest. It's almost as if by this point the search for realism had been completely abandoned by the creative team. At one point, in order to get a better machine gun shot at his competition, Jason goes backwards. \"Don't go backwards,\" advises the devastatingly beautiful navigator, clarifying why it was worth busting her out of a women's prison to perform this difficult task in the first place. The wise old mentor and father figure Ian McShane is quite clearly employed here not only as the car-builder and weapons expert, but also as Action Payoff Man - the device necessary when the actual hero isn't funny enough to provide his own \"looks like he lost his head\" moment after decapitating baddies. So we see Jason Statham beating up a man in the prison canteen. \"I guess he didn't like the oatmeal,\" says Lovejoy. A ha ha ha ha. Several cars blow up. \"Now THAT'S entertainment\" he says. LOL. Etc. Yes, wherever a mood-lightening quip after a particularly ultraviolent moment is needed, McShane will be there. The baddie There's a another driver. Tyrese Gibson. He seems equally intent on winning - less a baddie than a competitor, really, but since the idea is that everyone but the winner will end up dead, the lines are a bit blurred. Oh, except in the case of ... The big baddie \"He knows we set him up, what are we going to do?\" asks a prison officer lackey, explaining in depth so that everyone understands even if they weren't following the stunningly simple story thus far. \"We're going to kill him,\" says Joan. Brilliant. Well that's the last bit of plot accounted for, then. Everyone got that? The entire plot Champion race-car driver gets framed for wife-murder by evil prison warden with the harsh reality TV franchise and the kind of death wish that only applies to other people's deaths. But then he finds out and so the prison warden and her lackeys have to try and kill him. Lots of cars drive fast, and then explode. In one trailer alone, 19 crashes and 11 explosions, in fact. All we're missing is information about whether Jensen ends up dying (unlikely), bonking the navigator (likely) or becoming president and denouncing the culture that produces reality television instead of making intelligent and witty satire as well as an action film (not going to happen). In fact, if we had that, we wouldn't have to watch the movie at all. You've no doubt at all what the entire plot of this film is by the time you've got through a two and a half minute trailer - and that's an achievement in its own right. Very few trailers are this detailed. But then, you wonder, if you can get the entire plot across in under two and a half minutes, what's left? Well, explosions. Clearly. And when you have this many exploding cars who needs a plot?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
