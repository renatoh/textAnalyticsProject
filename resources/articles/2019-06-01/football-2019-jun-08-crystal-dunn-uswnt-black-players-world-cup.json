Whether it\u2019s stepping in to play whatever position is required on the day, offering her trademark levity to the sometimes high-strung atmosphere of training with the world champions or challenging stereotypes about black players in a sport disproportionately played in America by upper-middle class white kids, the ebullient 26-year-old from Long Island is always willing to do the little extra with an infectious smile. A natural forward who\u2019s spent a large chunk of her career unnerving defenders with her explosive acceleration, slashing cuts and preternatural sense of positioning, Dunn will be deployed as a left back when the United States open their World Cup title defense on Tuesday in the north-eastern French city of Reims against Thailand \u2013 and the debutant to the sport\u2019s biggest stage is relishing the challenge ahead. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to compete against top forwards,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cAs an attacking-minded player I have the chance to add something new to the outside back role and show people it really doesn\u2019t matter where you are on the pitch, you can impact the game anywhere.\u201d The re-assignment might elicit stage fright among her less adaptable colleagues but it\u2019s old hat for Dunn, who\u2019s scored 24 goals in 84 international appearances while playing every position except center back, defensive midfielder and goalkeeper for the top-ranked American squad. Her versatility is no accident, but a product of years of training aimed toward busting preconceptions about players who look like her. \u201cAs a black woman I always felt growing up I had to do above and beyond stuff to be noticed, to feel like I could hang with everybody else,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to implement so many different things in my game so that I\u2019m not just known for my speed. It\u2019s a stereotype that black players are just really fast, but at the end of day I want to be skilled, I want to be technical, I want to have vision and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always tried to promote in my game: not relying on one thing but just being able to outwork players in so many different ways.\u201d Dunn appeared bound for her World Cup debut four years ago, having led the University of North Carolina to a national championship as an attacking midfielder and featured on the U-17, U-18 and U-20 national sides before breaking in with the senior team in 2013. But her struggles in adapting to a fullback vacancy necessitated by a team-mate\u2019s injury left her among the last players cut from Jill Ellis\u2019s squad for Canada. Instead, she watched from a jam-packed sports bar in the nation\u2019s capital with oscillating emotions as the United States hoisted the trophy before a record domestic TV audience. Rather than sulk, Dunn took out her disappointment on the back lines of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, pounding in 15 goals in 20 matches for the Washington Spirit and becoming the youngest ever player to win the league\u2019s Golden Boot and Most Valuable Player awards. Her devastating speed and nose for the net prompted a move to Chelsea, where she found the back of the goal only 12 minutes into her first competitive appearance. But as Dunn set her sights on re-establishing herself with the national team, she was compelled to return home after one season with the Blues. While US Soccer denies that players must suit up in the NWSL to be considered for international duty, there\u2019s a tacit understanding among the USA women that it is, shall we say, easier to be seen when playing close to home \u2013 an unspoken decree that Dunn acknowledges diplomatically. \u201cMy time at Chelsea was incredible and I would go back in a heartbeat,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s important for the coaches to have visibility and be able to see me play. Back in 2017, I wasn\u2019t starting a lot of games or playing that many minutes (for the US team). I had to make a really tough decision of either enjoy my life in London or come back and just be seen by the coaching staff, so I decided to do what I thought was best for me to have a key role on this national team. As a player you need to make whatever decision you think is best for your career.\u201d Dunn returned stateside to join the NWSL\u2019s North Carolina Courage as a midfielder, helping the club to the league title as it set the circuit record for most goals in a season. The 5ft 1in Swiss army knife had also become as a regular in Ellis\u2019s team, earning a place as a forward on the 2016 Olympic squad \u2013 but since settling into the starting left back role for a group with an embarrassment of attacking riches that\u2019s been undermanned and occasionally patchy in the final third. \u201cI just needed a coach to say you\u2019re valuable, I\u2019m trusting you and from there it was all about growing into it and investing in my own self,\u201d Dunn says of the shift. \u201cI didn\u2019t wait for the coaching staff to really direct me. What I needed to do it was all about me wanting to do above and beyond stuff for the team. That\u2019s my hunger every single training is to always get better. Being a player that plays multiple positions, that\u2019s my mindset every single day because I don\u2019t have the luxury of just being really good at one thing.\u201d Says Ellis: \u201cShe\u2019s the most versatile player I\u2019ve ever coached. It\u2019s not just her ability to play in different lines, it\u2019s the quality with which she plays in different lines, which is quite extraordinary.\u201d Dunn believes the sting of her 2015 snub made her a better player and team-mate as the United States look to become the only the second country to repeat as Women\u2019s World Cup champions following a shock quarter-final exit to Sweden at the Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m a different person and a player than I was four years ago,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cI was always been known as a diverse player but I think now I\u2019ve just embraced it a little bit more. I\u2019ve had four years to really master being picked up, thrown into a different position on the field and I think four years ago I didn\u2019t really accept my role. I kind of crumbled under the feeling of: Oh, you want me to play a different position? I don\u2019t really think I can. I don\u2019t have the confidence in myself to do that. And I think that in theory is what got away from me. Fast forward four years where I\u2019m now I\u2019m a more complete player, a more confident player.\u201d She adds: \u201cI also don\u2019t take soccer as seriously as I think a lot of people do where they they get so stressed about everything. I have fun in training every day and I try to be the light in the group if things get too tense. I try to remind people we play a sport for a living. You\u2019re going to make mistakes. Four years ago, I used to crack under that feeling of if I made a bad pass my life\u2019s over. Now I\u2019m like I know I\u2019m valuable, I know I\u2019m needed and that\u2019s my mentality.\u201d Like most of her team-mates on the national side, Dunn\u2019s journey was deeply informed by the United States\u2019 dramatic World Cup win on home soil in 1999. Brandi Chastain\u2019s primal scream following her shootout-clinching, sports bra-baring penalty against China in front of more than 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl represented an indelible moment in American sports, driving youth participation in girls\u2019 soccer to untold heights and inspiring a new generation of athletes that have endowed the United States with one of the world\u2019s deepest talent pools. But the 99ers, for all their endurance in the national consciousness, were not an advertisement for diversity. The squad featured only one non-white player: longtime goalkeeper Briana Scurry. These days Dunn is one of five women of color on the squad along with Christen Press, Mallory Pugh, Jessica McDonald and Adrianna Franch. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer like: This is abnormal,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cI do think it\u2019s growing. It can definitely be more diverse, but we\u2019re headed in the right direction. I always try to be a good role model for those that do look like me because you know there\u2019s not a lot of us. So I always have to step on the field knowing that I have to lead by example and try to be my best person that I can be. \u201cObviously it\u2019s my job to support all women and obviously Brandi Chastain\u2019s moment raised so much awareness for the game. But how cool would it be if that was a black player? That is ultimately what I think could happen this World Cup. That being said I\u2019m not in this tournament to say I want that moment to be me, but I do think that it would change the landscape of the game and that it\u2019s important that all types of people are represented in this World Cup. I think that\u2019s what we all fought for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
