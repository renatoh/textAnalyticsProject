A fax will be sent from Elland Road to Parkhead and Peter Ridsdale, the Leeds chairman, intends to ask Celtic's hierarchy for official permission to speak to the man who has re-established them as the major force of Scottish football. Although Celtic will vigorously oppose any approach for O'Neill, who has just a year left on his contract, Leeds' preliminary investigations over the weekend have left them increasingly optimistic that the 50-year-old wants, at the very least, the opportunity to consider their offer. The Leeds board met in Harrogate yesterday to discuss the shortlist for the job which was made vacant by the sacking of David O'Leary last Thursday. And although the likes of Guus Hiddink, Terry Venables, Mick McCarthy, Steve McClaren and Graeme Souness featured in their discussions, O'Neill is the first choice despite it being almost certain that his employers will try to stop him talking to Leeds. That means O'Neill could face a repeat of the circumstances that prevented him taking the job in 1998. He had been Ridsdale's first choice to replace George Graham, but Leicester City, his club at the time, denied him the opportunity to have talks at Elland Road. O'Neill, who arrives home tomorrow after being part of the BBC's team for the World Cup final, will be offered vastly improved terms to stay at Celtic where he is known to be concerned about the club's apparent lack of financial clout to compete successfully in Europe. Should Leeds fail in their attempt to prise O'Neill away from Scotland then Hiddink is likely to be their next target. The Dutchman's stock has risen massively, having guided the unfancied South Koreans to the semi-finals of the World Cup. Hiddink is expected to take over at PSV Eindhoven this week, but when questioned at the weekend he refused to rule out a move to the Premiership and Leeds. \"I have not had any approach from Leeds but it would be nice to work in the Premier League,\" he said. Perhaps the most surprising name on the list is that of Venables. Ridsdale is a known admirer of the former England coach who has not been involved at a club since helping steer Middlesbrough clear of relegation two seasons ago and is currently working as a pundit for ITV. However, the Leeds board are desperate to land their first choice in O'Neill and Ridsdale wants the matter settled as quickly as possible. \u00b7 Arsenal are close to signing the highly rated French defender Pascal Cygan from Lille. The 28-year-old, who nearly joined West Ham last summer, admitted that he has been in contact with the Gunners and said: \"I am waiting for a yes or no from Arsenal. I visited the training facilities and Highbury a few weeks ago and I've spoken with their president.\" The president of Lille, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dobraje, added: \"The two parties are hoping to reach an agreement and things could even be concluded as early as the beginning of the week.\" \u00b7 Middlesbrough have made a \u00a34m bid for Aston Villa's unsettled Dutch midfielder George Boateng. Middlesbrough's manager Steve McClaren wants Boateng as a replacement for the out-of-contract Paul Ince, who could return to Italy with Brescia. Villa value Boateng at \u00a37m but the midfielder plans to appeal to Fifa to have the fee reduced. Barry Silkman, working with Boateng's Dutch-based advisers, said: \"George will definitely not be staying at Villa. Villa turned down Boro's offer but they set a ludicrous fee.\" \u00b7 Newcastle have held talks with Malaga over the sale of the Uruguayan striker Dario Silva. But the Newcastle manager Sir Bobby Robson will not pay the \u00a38m asking price for the 29-year-old, who retired from international football after the World Cup. Newcastle are also in the hunt for 28-year-old former Coventry defender Gary Breen. The Republic of Ireland centre-back, available on a Bosman free transfer, is wanted by Everton but the Geordies are also interested despite spending \u00a35m on Ipswich's Titus Bramble. \u00b7 The World Cup may just be finishing but for the Irish club St Patrick's Athletic the new season is well underway. They set up an Intertoto Cup second-round meeting with the Belgian side Gent with a 1-0 victory over the Croatian club Rijeka. The first leg eight days ago ended 3-2 in favour of the Croatians, but Rijeka were unable to take advantage of their territorial dominance after Charles Livingstone had given St Pat's an early lead. The Irish team will now prepare for the first leg in Belgium next Saturday. The opening exchanges were dominated by Rijeka who created several chances but it was Pat's who struck first after 22 minutes when Livingstone ran clear on to Paul Donnelly's through-ball before rounding Matko Kalinic and slotted the ball into an empty net."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
