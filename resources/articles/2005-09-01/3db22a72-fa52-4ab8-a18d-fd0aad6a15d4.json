The owner of the Ayutthaya elephant farm, 45 miles north of Bangkok, is selling about 20 of his 140 pachyderms. Prices start at 2m baht (\u00a327,000) and the animals come with a verbal guarantee of being well bred, well behaved and a source of good luck. But there are a few strings attached. Mr Laithongrian will sell his animals only to Thai nationals who have enough land and a demonstrable knowledge of elephant rearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
