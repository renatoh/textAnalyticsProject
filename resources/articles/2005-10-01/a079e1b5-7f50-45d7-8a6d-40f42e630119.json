The Chip and PIN Programme said fraud using counterfeit, lost and stolen cards dropped by \u00a336m to \u00a389.9m - and it credited the new system for the fall. The organisation also announced that the option to sign for transactions will be phased out after February 14, forcing cardholders to use their Pin numbers. A spokeswoman said the \"minority of customers\" who did not use their numbers had four months left \"to ensure they find out, remember and use their Pins\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
