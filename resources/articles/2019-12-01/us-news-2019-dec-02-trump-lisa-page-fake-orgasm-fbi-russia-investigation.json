Page told the Beast: \u201cIt had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.\u201d Page left the FBI in May 2018 amid controversy, driven by Trump, over her role in the Russia investigation and an extra-marital relationship she had with bureau agent Peter Strzok, who went on to work for special counsel Robert Mueller. Strzok was fired in August 2018. At a rally in Minnesota in October, Trump read from messages between Page and Strzok, from August 2016, three months before the election. Apparently pretending to have an orgasm, the president said: \u201cI love you, Peter! I love you too Lisa! Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, Oh God, I love you, Lisa. \u201cAnd if [Hillary Clinton] doesn\u2019t win, Lisa, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy, Lisa! We\u2019ll get that son of a bitch out.\u201d The messages between Strzok and Page were made public during Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. In one famous exchange, Page asked: \u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d Strzok replied: \u201cNo. No he\u2019s not. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The pro-Trump right immediately seized on the messages as evidence of supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d bias against the president. But while the deep state conspiracy theory holds that a permanent government of bureaucrats and intelligence operatives exists to thwart Trump, one of its first proponents, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, has said on record it is \u201cfor nut cases\u201d. Being the subject of sustained presidential invective, Page said, was \u201calmost impossible to describe. It\u2019s like being punched in the gut. My heart drops to my stomach when I realise he has tweeted about me again. The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He\u2019s demeaning me and my career. It\u2019s sickening.\u201d Page, now in private practice, said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t even call [her experience] [post-traumatic stress disorder] because it\u2019s not over. It\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s not a historical event that is being relived. It just keeps happening\u201d. Referring to a tweet sent by Trump four days before the interview, she said: \u201cWhen Roger Stone got convicted, he asked: why isn\u2019t Page in jail too? Not to mention, you know, his truly reprehensible, degrading stunt at his rally, in which he used my name to simulate an orgasm. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t ever know when the president\u2019s going to attack next. And when it happens, it can still sort of upend my day. You don\u2019t really get used to it.\u201d Like most of Washington \u2013 and the president \u2013 Page is now awaiting the publication on 9 December of a report by the justice department inspector general into Trump\u2019s claim that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign. Page is expected to be exonerated of acting unprofessionally or with bias against Trump. Of the political views she exchanged with Strzok, she told the Beast \u201chaving an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds\u201d of regulations covering political activity by federal employees. The Department of Justice was roundly criticised for releasing Page and Strzok\u2019s messages to the press. Page said it was \u201cvery painful to see to places like the FBI and the Department of Justice that represent so much of what is excellent about this country, not fulfilling the critical obligation that they have to speak truth to power\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s crushing to see the noble justice department, my justice department, the place I grew up in, feel like it\u2019s abandoned its principles of truth and independence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
