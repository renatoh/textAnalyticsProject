Mr Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive officer of the media group, said he wanted to resolve lingering issues with Liberty before the end of the current quarter. Asked about the group's plans for its $6bn (\u00a33.15bn) cash reserves, Mr Murdoch told analysts last night: \"We've got various ways to deal with that, but we're not going to make up our mind until we resolve the Liberty position, which we would expect to do before we get back to you again in three months.\" Mr Malone, who is best known for his cable TV interests, announced last November he was raising his stake in News Corp to 18% - a move seen as a potential threat to Mr Murdoch's succession plan. The relationship between the two tycoons has been under scrutiny for a year and Mr Murdoch reacted by putting in place a \"poison pill\" defence, in effect preventing Mr Malone from increasing his holding further. Mr Murdoch made his comments as News Corp reported an 8% decline in net profits for the first three months of this year. Profits at the group were hit by high Super Bowl programming costs at its Fox TV network and a charge for restructuring its holdings in several regional sports channels. The company, whose properties include the 20th Century Fox studio, Fox News Channel and the New York Post, earned $400m in its third quarter, down from $434m a year ago. Revenues rose 17% to $6.04bn from $5.16bn in the same period a year ago. Mr Murdoch said the decline in TV earnings was partly due to a \"soft\" advertising market in the US but that the Fox network was on the way to winning the ratings race for the current TV season for the first time ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
