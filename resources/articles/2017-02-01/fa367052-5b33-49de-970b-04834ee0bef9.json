The prime minister made the comments in an interview on 3AW Radio on Friday in which he rejected the Coaliton senator Ian Macdonald\u2019s call to retain politicians\u2019 life gold travel pass and advocated that the government should take an ownership stake in infrastructure projects. Asked about the $5.6m pay packet of Australia Post\u2019s chief executive, Ahmed Fahour, Turnbull said it was \u201cway too much\u201d, repeating a criticism he made earlier in the week. Turnbull said he had confidence in the Australia Post board and suggested that Fahour volunteer for a pay cut. He said the board independently set executives\u2019 pay and Fahour\u2019s contract dated back to the Labor government. \u201cAhmed Fahour is a very talented man \u2026 I have a high regard for him. But that is too much money for that job. \u201cI think there are a lot of corporate CEOs, by the way, that are overpaid. I think there\u2019s become a sort of, it\u2019s almost a cult of excessive executive CEO remuneration.\u201d The treasurer, Scott Morrison, agreed that Australians were confused by the scale of executive pay and said company boards making decisions about pay needed to be accountable to their shareholders and customers. \u201cI think Australians when they look at these issues scratched their heads,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat puts a greater accountability on boards, CEOs and executives to explain. \u201cThis trust between businesses and their customers and the community more generally is for them to manage and, like any other Australian, you see these things and sometimes you scratch your head.\u201d Asked about Macdonald\u2019s call on Thursday for the politicians\u2019 travel pass to be retained, after Turnbull announced it would be abolished, the prime minister replied that politicians worked hard but if they thought they weren\u2019t adequately paid they could resign or not recontest the election. \u201cThe gold pass is a relic of a bygone era of perks \u2026 It\u2019s not the modern era, that\u2019s why I\u2019m abolishing them,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that some people feel aggrieved about it, but the idea that just because someone has been in parliament for 20 years, for the rest of their life can fly around at public expense, it\u2019s almost Dickensian.\u201d Turnbull said he was \u201cnot a hater\u201d and did \u201cnot develop personal animosities towards people\u201d but, explaining his attacks on Shorten this week, added it was \u201cimportant to show him up for the hypocrite he is\u201d. He said the Labor leader was \u201cduplicitous\u201d for changing his position on company tax and hypocritical for dining with billionaires while pretending to be \u201cthe horny handed son of toil\u201d. Shorten held himself out as \u201ca working-class hero, the champion of the common man\u201d, he said, despite the Australian Workers\u2019 Union trading away members\u2019 penalty rates at Cleanevent and Chiquita Mushrooms during his time as its leader. \u201cIf you are representing someone, if you\u2019re a union or lawyer \u2026 your job is to get the best deal for them and you\u2019re certainly not entitled to be taking benefits yourself, and that\u2019s exactly what the AWU did,\u201d he said, citing findings of the trade union royal commission. Turnbull claimed his speech in question time was \u201cex tempore, off the cuff\u201d after Shorten launched an attack based on the politics of envy against him. The prime minister said governments \u201cshould be more entrepreneurial\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be prepared to invest in infrastructure \u2026 take an ownership stake in it, government\u2019s can live on what by commercial standards is a very low rate of return.\u201d Asked on FIVEaa in an earlier interview about state governments nationalising their electricity grids, Turnbull queried whether that would result in South Australia being cut off from the Victorian interconnector. \u201cSouth Australia would become blacked out more often than not at that rate,\u201d he said. Asked on 3AW about reports that the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has said she is not concerned the US will tear up its free trade agreement, Turnbull said \u201cnobody imagines any threat\u201d to the deal because the US has a trade surplus with Australia. \u201cGiven that Donald Trump is worried about countries where it is the reverse, like with China, I don\u2019t think we need be concerned about US Australia free trade agreement.\u201d Turnbull said he did not admire Vladimir Putin, noting that Russia had invaded the Crimea peninsula in Ukraine and forces backed by its government had shot down the MH17 flight that killed Australians in \u201can act of terrorism\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
