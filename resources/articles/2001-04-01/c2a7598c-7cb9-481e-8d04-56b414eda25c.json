Mr Bright's move to relinquish day-to-day control prompted speculation that the 14-year-old company might attract a takeover bid. The surprise announcement came at yesterday's annual shareholder meeting, immediately after the board had discussed the shares' drop in just two months from above \u00a33.50 to yesterday's \u00a31.33. Chairman Garth Ramsay, who is to take a temporary executive role while a new chief executive is sought, said: \"The share price has performed very poorly since the results in early March. It reflects a loss of confidence in the company in terms of the stock market\". He insisted that Mr Bright - whose personal wealth is tied up in the company - had not been pushed and that the decision was \"mutual\". Mr Bright, who built the company up from scratch, owns some 14m shares and did not take last year's bonus. He took home \u00a3650,000 against \u00a31m the year before. Until February, Independent Insurance was one of the stock market's favourites. It suffered a sharp reversal in its fortunes after a profits warning in February and the announcement in March of a 42% fall in its profits to \u00a340m. The company has suffered from underwriting losses in France and \"no fee, no win\" insurance claims. It also has a complicated reinsurance arrangement in place which, it said, would cost \u00a339m in cash. While the step-down by Mr Bright caused concern because of his close association with the company, Barrie Cornes, analyst at ING Barings, said: \"Michael Bright is very well known. He is surrounded by strong people.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
