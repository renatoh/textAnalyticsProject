Yes there were a few quirky nods \u2013 one to a pothole crusader on the benches behind him, and another to a bingo buff. Budget day, after all, involves a unique freedom to sup whisky at the dispatch box, and unremitting gravity is not the done thing. The real message, however \u2013 and right from the outset \u2013 was one of stern resolve. \"We set out a plan \u2026 we held our nerve,\" he began. Yes, it was working, he went on, but we're nowhere near mission accomplished yet. Of course, Mr Osborne enjoyed reading out improving growth figures, but he'd littered his speech with notes to self saying \"don't get carried away\". And he didn't. That was wise, for the stagnation of 2011 and 2012 has left a giant hole in his books. He is still borrowing \u00a3108bn this year, double the \u00a360bn that plan A had pencilled in. In incremental concessions to reality, the one retrenching parliament he initially promised has turned into two, with cuts set to continue for a near decade. None of this worries the chancellor as much as it might because, rightly or wrongly, the country's gut instinct is that borrowing would have been even higher under Labour. Responding to the chancellor, Ed Miliband stressed living standards before economics, which will not have done much to shift that perception. Mr Osborne's numbers may have crumbled under pressure of events, but what matters to him is appearing consistent \u2013 and he does. He called for cuts in the recession, and now \u2013 in a recovery \u2013 he calls for more. In Tony Benn's terms, he can sell himself as a signpost rather than a weather vane. This pitch is, however, spin. Even on his defining question \u2013 the deficit \u2013 there is less resolve than meets the eye. While yesterday barely changed the overall stance, we saw \u2013 and not for the first time \u2013 a little easement now, in return for further tightening post-election. Lord, make me virtuous \u2013 but not yet! The surprise abolition of the rule about turning pension savings into income, reinforces the sense of trickery. Freeing retirees to draw down their savings at ordinary rather than punitive tax rates will generate income and thus revenue for now, revenues Mr Osborne duly scored. But once the money is spent, it will not be there to tax further down the line, as it would have been if locked into a lifetime annuity. So, for the Exchequer, this is jam today at the cost of jam tomorrow. The \u00a3400m+ banked for each of the next two years from higher national insurance has a similar effect \u2013 people with broken careers and contributions records hand over cheques today, but the Treasury is saddled with paying higher pensions for the future. There will, then, be a payback time with both these policies, but \u2013 conveniently \u2013 neither of them accrues within the time horizon of the main budget tables. The big private pension reform will be hailed to the rafters on many weekend money pages aimed at the rich. That does not, necessarily, make it a bad reform: the instant dive in shares for annuity houses could indicate leaching middle men being squeezed. On the other hand, it could be a sign of the bottom being pulled out of the market in insurance against living longer. With annuities optional, only those with the best chance of making their 90s \u2013 active, non-smoking women \u2013 may buy them. If so, dismal rates will get still worse, and those who live longest will pay the price. The point about a reform like this is that it should be developed carefully, not whipped out of the hat as fait accompli on budget day. The chief impression from the raft of micro-measures is not consistency of purpose, but carefree expediency. Not all the ideas were bad. But the chancellor who cut investment allowances now increases them to boost growth. The man who introduced a rising carbon price floor, to provide green energy investors with certainty, has now frozen that. Where green taxes were supposed to be doing more work, levies on petrol, flights and heavy industry are now all cut at once. Then there were all the traps for Labour, gratuitous parliamentary votes on welfare and borrowing, confected to force the opposition into a corner. But there is one core commitment, where Mr Osborne has stuck steadfastly to his course \u2013 shrinking the state. At the election he promised a ludicrously lop-sided retrenchment, with spending cuts shouldering 80% and taxes just 20%. He has actually over-delivered: an astonishing 94% of the extra consolidation he has announced is coming through cuts. Where that leaves the Liberal Democrats, who in 2010 proposed a two-thirds/one-third mix is unclear. They have worked more harmoniously with the Tories on this budget than they have for some time, and are thrilled to have got yet another increase in tax allowances. But now that the Tories have insisted on passing this on in full to higher-rate taxpayers, there can no longer be any pretence that this is a policy targeted on the poor. This was the budget of, as Mr Osborne proudly put it, a Conservative chancellor. And about his Conservatism, if little else, Mr Osborne is very serious indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
