Wales face France at the Principality Stadium on Friday night looking for a fifth successive victory over Les Bleus, who have not finished in the top half of the Six Nations since 2011, having long abandoned their tradition of running rugby. \u201cEveryone asks where the French flair has gone because they had world-class attacking players,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cThe reason there is not much of it any more is not because they no longer have the players, it\u2019s that teams today are so well organised defensively there is no space on the field. \u201cYou always come up against an organised defence and players who are as conditioned and fit as you are with the ability to shut out teams. In the past, France went out with a \u2018jouer, jouer\u2019 attitude, playing what was in front of them. \u201cFor sides like us, it is happy days if they do that. We love it if teams play like that against us because it is so easy to shut down. Do you go back to injury replacements so that players become more fatigued and not quite as big and powerful as they are now? \u201cThose are things for the rule makers to look at and it\u2019s a concern for the game that we are conditioning 130-140kg players to last for 15-20 minutes [as replacements], whereas in the old days if they were starting they would be gone after 40-50 minutes, opening up the room we are all craving at the moment. \u201cAs it is, the breaks you tend to get now come from someone missing a tackle or making a system error and that does not happen much at the top level. We are all trying to be innovative but the more creative you try to become, the better teams become defensively.\u201d This year\u2019s Six Nations has been compared unflatteringly to the autumn\u2019s World Cup in terms of the quality of the rugby and the ambition shown by teams. \u201cThe weather was not conducive to running rugby in the opening two rounds,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cThe World Cup was played in different weather conditions when it was much warmer. We are coming into the third round and teams are probably going to have to go out there and play and try to score more points. Eddie Jones is doing a good job of winding up the Irish at the moment.\u201d France have agreed to play under a closed roof on Friday, unlike England last year, who opted to keep it open, attracting the scorn of Wales but winning the match. France\u2019s head coach, Guy Nov\u00e8s, has made five changes from the side who defeated Ireland in the last round. Djibril Camara replaces the injured Teddy Thomas on the wing and Maxime Machenaud, who was influential after coming off the bench in the 10-9 win against Ireland, starts at scrum-half. At forward, Nov\u00e8s has altered the front, second and back rows. Rabah Slimani returns at tighthead prop, Paul Jedrasiak replaces Yoann Maestri in the second row and Antoine Burban, who has a reputation for hard tackling, has been named at wing forward. The fly-half Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc is named among the replacements on his return to the squad. \u201cMatches against France are always physically demanding,\u201d the Wales captain, Sam Warburton, said. \u201cWe are all working hard to bring the title back to Wales. We won the Six Nations in 2012 and 2013 and I am not sure we realised then just how hard to is to achieve that. We have a great chance to do it again this year.\u201d France team to play Wales, Principality Stadium, Cardiff, 8.05pm Friday 26 February M M\u00e9dard; V Vakatawa, M Mermoz, J Danty, D Camara; J Plisson, M Machenaud; J Poirot, G Guirado (capt), R Slimani, P Jedrasiak, A Flanquart, W Lauret, A Burban, D Chouly.
