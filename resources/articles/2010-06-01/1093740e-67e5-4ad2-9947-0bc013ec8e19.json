And as they prepare for the onslaught, there are a few things they apparently need to remember. \"Change Your T-shirt\" is one of them. Another is the need to \"Develop Fruity Thinking\". They should know that \"Hippo Time Is OK\", and that they must always \"Remember the Beachball\". \"Learn Latin\", especially carpe diem (seize the day), is another essential. And enough of the que sera sera approach \u2013 \"Ditch Doris Day\". And they will remember these things because all are mantras being imparted to civil servants as part of training that mandarins have bought from Paul McGee, aka the Sumo Guy. Sumo, staff learn, means Shut Up (stop, reflect, let go of baggage) and Move On (tomorrow can be different. Don't just think, act). Having been exposed to the Sumo doctrine, some members of the Public and Commercial Services Union pronounce it laughable and worse \u2013 and, sadly, all the cynics wish to know is how much it is costing. For fruity thinking may be fun, but it doesn't come cheap. \u2022 But it is well worth the price, McGee tells us, albeit he declines to say what the price is. Some of the slogans may be ripe for parody, but unpacked, he insists, they make good sense. Four DWP staff went through his Sumo Academy earlier this year and, having absorbed it all in a four-day course, they now pass on those philosophies to colleagues. And they are not alone, for the Sumo man has many clients \u2013 hospitals, Premiership soccer teams \u2013 and many testimonials. \"People wouldn't use me if there was no value,\" he says. Time to shut up. Move on. \u2022 Trouble on the horizon perhaps for recorder Robin Pearse-Wheatley, who featured here last month having told two Icelandic women who hooked up with a gang of criminals to commit a brutal \"honeytrap\" robbery that their error was a choice of friends. \"You seem to have fallen in with a group of black men, which seems to have been the beginning of your unfortunate adventures,\" he said. Yes, you were involved in a nasty crime, but it was \"no doubt at the behest of these frightening black men\". Not the best choice of words. And now Pearse-Wheatley finds himself the subject of a lengthy letter of condemnation signed by a populous group including Tony Benn, Wes Streeting, the president of the National Union of Students, and Aaron Porter, the NUS president elect. Ian Grigg Spall, of the National Critical Lawyers Group, is a signatory, as is Gerry Morrissey, head of the union Bectu, and Steve Pope, editor of the black newspaper the Voice. A submission to the Office for Judicial Complaints is being prepared. Who knows, the judge may be about to embark on an \"unfortunate adventure\" of his own. \u2022 As the right continues to vent its anger on the coalition wrecking activities of the Daily Telegraph, the paper can claim that once again it has performed a public service. Not the revealing of David Laws's expense claims. Or revelations about Danny Alexander's financial arrangements. No, the issue here is the Telegraph's recent feature on luxury properties that are empty because their owners have jumped ship and are selling up post-election. All grand houses in Kent, in Warwickshire, in Norfolk \u2013 and squatter groups tell us they are very grateful. The only remaining requirement is a pair of pliers. \u2022 More bacchanalian madness from Greece's tourist office in London as the country reels from creditors and rioters. February saw it fly in three chefs for a nationwide promotion, starting at the Intercontinental Hotel at Hyde Park Corner. Last month, there was a five-course Cretan lunch on London's South Bank for tourism types and property developers. And now, from the only country we can talk down to on the subject of debt, a Greek beach by the Thames that will be open to the public. \"Come and relax on sunbeds, and let your imagination take you to the Greek islands,\" says the exciting blurb. Think strikes. Think protests. Lie back. You're almost there. \u2022 And should we, finally, accept the account of Christian traders who say they survived a nasty crash on the A40 because of the impact-absorbing cargo they carried \u2013 holy socks? Isn't it possible that they were protected by some of the other items: glory golf balls, hallelujah hats and biblical brollies? Could have been any or all of those."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
