The Israeli flag was lowered from the West Bank town and roadblocks were dismantled. The hand over forms part of a ceasefire package agreed last month by the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. The initial implementation of the deal was delayed by a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on February 25 which left five Israelis dead. Meanwhile, Israeli television station Channel Two reported tonight that Jewish extremists plan to take over a disputed holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem in an attempt to sabotage Israel's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank in the summer. Channel Two showed video footage of a meeting of extremists, including rabbis, where they discussed flooding the site - known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary - with Jews. This action would create a diversion for the army and police, preventing them from evacuating settlers from Gaza and the northern West Bank. \"We must bring 100,000 people to the Temple Mount,\" said a rabbi identified as Chen Eliahu in the video. Earlier today in Jericho, Israeli and Palestinian security commanders met repeatedly throughout today to co-ordinate the hand over there. There were chaotic scenes this afternoon as officials struggled to reach a decision about whether the change-over should be marked by a handshake or a signature. The Palestinians insisted on a signature prompting the Israelis to demand time to show the document to a legal adviser. More than an hour later, officers from both sides returned for the signing ceremony at a liaison office on the outskirts of the town. As part of the pullback in Jericho, Israeli troops removed one roadblock, while two other barriers are to remain in place for a month, to test the effectiveness of the Palestinian security forces' policing. The Palestinians had insisted all checkpoints were removed, but accepted the compromise. Jericho is the first of five West Bank towns to be handed back the Palestinians in an attempt to stem the violence that has persisted since the outbreak of fighting in September 2000. Israel erected dozens of barriers across the West Bank to prevent Palestinian suicide bombers and gunmen from reaching Israeli targets. Despite the blockade, hundreds of Israelis have been killed in attacks by militants in the past five years. The others towns included in the pullout deal include Bethlehem, Ramallah, Tulkarem and Qalqiliya. Today Palestinians were sceptical, but hopeful. Issa Saasine, a plastics trader visiting Jericho from Hebron, said: \"A prisoner living in a cell will always be very glad when the guards open a window. \"Any small improvement is welcome, but more is needed to bring about confidence and stability.\" Jericho, a farming and resort town in the Jordan valley, has largely stayed out of the fighting, and Israeli troops rarely entered the region in search of fugitives. \"The point is we are trying to get things back ... gradually, hoping that through peace and negotiations things will change,\" said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. As part of the hand-over, Israel is easing checks at the main roadblock at the southern entrance to Jericho, allowing traffic through the area without inspection. In the past, long queues often formed in both directions. The move likely to help the local economy, which depends on tourism. Elsewhere today, an Israeli policeman was injured in the West Bank city of Hebron when police clashed with masked Jewish settlers attacking the home of a Palestinian family. The settlers attacked the officer while he was filming them striking with hammers at the home's foundations, Israeli police spokesman Shlomi Seguy said. The officer was slightly injured and his video camera destroyed. The house sustained extensive damage and one of its walls collapsed. Mr Seguy said one settler was arrested in the confrontation. The home was evacuated on Israeli army orders shortly after the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian violence in September 2000. It is situated in Hebron's tiny Jewish enclave, which is home to 500 settlers, and the army wanted it vacated to increase its ability to safeguard the area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
