First, on the only recent poll that really counts, the 2004 European elections, Respect won in the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency which I am contesting, was second in East Ham and West Ham and third in Poplar and Canning Town. The Lib Dems were a distant third in Bethnal Green and fourth in the other three; in East and West Ham their vote was only marginally larger than Ukip's. In these four east London constituencies, which are spearheading our campaign, even on the logic of Tariq'sargument, you should vote Respect to defeat the New Labour warmongers. Second, Tariq's logic is fundamentally flawed. The Lib Dems are a fake anti-war party. They were always prepared to support the war on Iraq if Bush and Blair had been able to cajole a \"second\" resolution out of the UN. The Lib Dems did reverse their position anyway as soon as the bombs started dropping on Iraq and they have continued to support the US led occupation. Third, the huge anti-war demonstration just over a week ago in London and recent opinion polls clearly show that the cynicism of the electorate, enormously compounded by the lies that took us to war, extends to all three major parties. Anti-war voters not only want credible parties which took a principled stand against the war, they want radical policies on a much broader front, reversing the Thatcherism and Blairism of the last 25 years. They want opposition to privatisation and commitment to the redistribution of resources towards our pensioners and children and our public services. But there is barely a cigarette paper to separate the Lib Dems from the Tories and New Labour on these issues. The best thing we can do to continue the radicalism of the anti-war movement is to maximise the vote for Respect and principled anti-war candidates. George Galloway MP Respect, Glasgow Kelvin Shortly before the votes were cast in the Brent East byelection, Ken Livingstone wrote in the Guardian that votes for the Lib Dems would let the Tories win the seat. The actual result? Votes for the Liberal Democrats elected a Liberal Democrat, with the Tories nowhere. So it is progress of a sort to see Livingstone (Letters, March 28) now worrying that when people vote Liberal Democrat they will indeed elect Liberal Democrats.
