There are six projects vying for the Stirling prize 2017, which is awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in recognition of the building that has made the greatest contribution to UK architecture in the past year. This year\u2019s shortlist \u201ctypifies everything that is special about UK architecture\u201d, said Jane Duncan, RIBA president. \u201cThis is not just a collection of exceptionally well designed buildings, but spaces and places of pure beauty, surprise and delight.\u201d The shortlist for the prize features Barrett\u2019s Grove, a slender brick-clad and wicker-balconied development of six flats in east London; the subterranean extension of the British Museum\u2019s World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre; the redevelopment of Chatham Historic Dockyard, Command of the Oceans; a new central campus for the City of Glasgow College; the community-led restored Hastings Pier; and a new photography studio complex in west London for the photographer Juergen Teller. Last year the prize, now in its 22nd year, was won by Newport Street Gallery, a row of listed industrial buildings converted to house artist Damien Hirst\u2019s private collection. Other previous winners include the Scottish parliament, Gateshead Millennium Bridge, and Liverpool Everyman theatre. Duncan said: \u201cThis year\u2019s shortlisted schemes show exceptionally creative, beautifully considered and carefully detailed buildings that have made every single penny count. \u201cCommissioned at the end of the recession, they are an accolade to a creative profession at the top of its game. Each of these outstanding projects has transformed its local area and delights those who are lucky enough to visit, live, study or work in them.\u201d Duncan said half of the shortlisted buildings were visitor destinations while the other half demonstrate intelligent were responses to challenging urban sites. The World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre was an \u201cextremely skilful\u201d partially underground extension for the display, conservation and storage of the British Museum\u2019s incredible collections, she said. \u201cRogers Stirk Harbour + Partners have overcome incredibly complex planning constraints to create a building that enhances the area and this much-loved institution.\u201d Command of the Oceans brought a \u201cbold and accessible new visitor experience\u201d to Chatham Historic Dockyard, she continued. \u201cA striking black visitor entrance, exciting approach to conservation, and inventive raised route around the complex have given the dockyard a dramatic new lease of life.\u201d Hastings pier, meanwhile, has been driven by the passionate local community in response to the fire that destroyed the Victorian structure in 2010. Duncan said: \u201cThis versatile and beautiful contemporary pier and visitor centre sits upon the repaired Victorian ironwork of the original pier, and is kickstarting the town\u2019s renaissance.\u201d Of Barret\u2019s Grove, the RIBA president said: \u201cThrough careful use of a tactile palette of materials including brick, timber and wicker, [the building] has injected an extraordinary small development of delightful, warm homes into an otherwise ordinary street in north London.\u201d The City of Glasgow College\u2019s new campuswas an \u201cimmensely confident contribution\u201d to the architecture of the city, she Duncan. \u201cUnique elements like street-front \u2018shops\u2019 for the college\u2019s trainee hairdressers and chefs to earn and learn add to the comprehensive facilities that raise the bar for higher education buildings.\u201d Despite its constrained and semi-industrial plot in west London, Teller\u2019s studio complex was, she said, an \u201coasis in which the architects and landscape designer Dan Pearson have created a seemingly modest yet sublime light-filled studio and garden\u201d. Duncan added: \u201cEvery single detail created by this exceptionally talented architect is precise and highly considered.\u201d Several of the architects have won or been shortlisted before, including previous winners Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. They have previously won for Maggie\u2019s Centre London in 2009 and Barajas airport, Madrid, in 2006. dRMM, this year up for Hastings pier, have been shortlisted twice before (Clapham Manor school in 2010 and Trafalgar Place in 2016). The winner will be announced in October at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
