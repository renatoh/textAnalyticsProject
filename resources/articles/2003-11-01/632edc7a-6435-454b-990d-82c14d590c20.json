Neil Warnock and Gary Megson may have emerged as candidates to replace Peter Reid but Paul Hart is the favourite for the time being, partly because of his affection for this shipwreck of a club but mostly because he has fallen out of love with Nottingham Forest. Whether Reid's most likely successor can save Leeds from relegation is a question that can be answered only at the end of the season but, if the Yorkshire club want someone with experience of crisis management and dealing with appalling debts, their old centre-half has all the necessary credentials. He preaches good football, good manners and good living and has nurtured a reputation as one of the finest discoverers of young talent in the game. Once in charge of the Leeds youth academy, he was credited with finding Harry Kewell, Alan Smith, Jonathan Woodgate and Paul Robinson and at Forest he has unearthed the likes of Jermaine Jenas and other outstanding young talents such as Michael Dawson and Andy Reid. Now 50, Hart also has the decided advantage, along with other possibilities such as Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister, of being seen by Leeds's fans as \"one of us\" from his time at Elland Road in the 70s. The club's official history records that \"Hart's style of clearance was unfancy though effective, and the same could be said of his tackling, for which the adjective 'rugged' might have been invented. At times, he was a little too determined that strikers should not pass.\" In other words, the type of man they love at Elland Road. They have loved him at the City Ground, too, but there is a certain irony that Leeds are now coveting Hart at a time when many Forest supporters have started questioning his methods and a minority have even been campaigning for his removal as manager. The statistic Hart must hope Professor John McKenzie, Trevor Birch and Allan Leigh ton choose to overlook is that Leeds would be employing a man whose Forest side have won only two of their past 13 games (against the First Division's bottom two sides), leaving their chances of promotion this season somewhere between slim and non-existent. Hart blames his chairman Nigel Doughty for a perceived lack of ambition, but the alternative viewpoint is that the manager made some crucial errors in the summer, when valuable players left the club and were not adequately replaced. Most of the supporters remain behind him, but his star has definitely fallen. \"If Leeds pay \u00a3250,000 [compensation] for Hart - a rookie manager with a W1 D1 L1 record - they really need their heads seeing to\" was a typical comment on Forest's official website chat-room yesterday. The backlash will surprise many people after the involvement of Hart's team in the play-offs last season, and as yet it has largely gone unnoticed by the mainstream media, mainly because Forest are not big news any more and their desire to play neat, attractive football spares them from critical insight. Most people have a soft spot for the club that Brian Clough twice made Euro pean champions and there are plenty of romantics who would love to see them back in the Premiership. The rift between Hart and Doughty has been kept in the background because they are both private, dignified characters who do not believe in public spats, but the truth is that their relationship has been strained for several months and may now have suffered irreparable damage. Doughty is entitled to be appalled by the news that Hart is so disillusioned that he was interviewed for the West Ham job before Alan Pardew's appointment, and this may have contributed to him not making any transfer money available unless the club are what he describes as \"competitive\" - in the First Division's play-off places. All of this should strengthen Leeds's hand if, as expected, they choose to follow up their interest with an official approach. Before then, however, the men in power at Elland Road should consult their caretaker manager Eddie Gray or at least read his book, Marching on Together. Gray remembers Hart as a \"tremendous coach\" when Leeds won the FA Youth Cup in 1993, but also describes him as a \"fiery\" disciplinarian and \"not the easiest person to work for\". \"He was great with me, but he could be abrasive with other people,\" says Gray. \"He was very intense, which no doubt could be attributed partly to the responsibility on his shoulders, and explosive.\" This might not necessarily be a bad thing if it succeeds in reinvigorating Mark Viduka, one of the main challenges left by Reid. Hart has remained close to Smith, speaking to him regularly on the telephone, so he would immediately have an important ally in the dressing room and he would explore the possibilities of bringing Danny Mills back from his season-long loan at Middlesbrough and Stephen McPhail from Forest. So far Leeds and Hart have been checking each other out like two third-formers at a school disco - plenty of eye contact but little action. Now it is time for Leeds to deliver the chat-up line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
