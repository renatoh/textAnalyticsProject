Despite improving upon the 2010 attendance figures by an impressive 12% (excluding the ever-popular Newmarket Nights concerts during the summer), crowd figures remain unusually small for a Grade One racecourse. Around 15,700 watched last year's 2000 Guineas, the biggest crowd at Newmarket all season, but only 10,700 saw the July Cup run on a Saturday for the first time compared with 36,500 at Chester and even more at York on the dame day. With the racing director Michael Prosser working hard to ensure that some of the top international sprinters are enticed to line up, it would come as a considerable blow if Newmarket could not at least edge nearer to its 22,000 capacity on the July course. Attendance figures are at the top of Starkey's agenda, although she admitted she is keen to distance herself from the image of her previous job at Kempton where she developed a reputation for coming up with unusual marketing ideas such as staging a race in 2009 to the backdrop of live music from the London Philharmonic Orchestra \u2013 a move which the winning jockey described as stupid. \"The race to music was about making Kempton famous for that night and building upon that with other ideas in 2010 and 2011,\" said the 30-year-old Starkey, who took over at Newmarket at the start of this week. \"I am proud of what I achieved at Kempton but I wanted this job. I put myself forward for it and I am thrilled to have got it. What was right for Kempton might not be right for Newmarket, though. \"One particular aspect that I want to focus upon in the weeks and months ahead is trying to increase the number of visitors that we have. Clearly the racecourse would like to invest in its programme and improving the numbers is part of that process, as all of the track's profits go back into racing. \"I get a really good feeling as I walk around and I'm excited by what I think we can do. Yes, every racecourse has its challenges but I've come racing here for a number of years and it is a very special place.\" More racehorses, trainers, jockeys and stable staff are based in Newmarket than any other one place in the world, and Starkey explained that she wants to build upon the unique nature of the racecourse's relationship with the town. \"We need to become closer to the local community,\" she said. \"There is history and heritage at Newmarket \u2013 maybe we need to bring that to life and tell the story a little more. I think there are people who even work in the sport who don't know that racing has been taking place here for many hundreds of years.\" With only a month to go until the 2000 Guineas, French Fifteen threw down the first of this season's Classic markers with victory in the Prix Djebel at Maisons-Laffitte on Thursday. His Newmarket odds were consequently cut from 20-1 to 10-1 by Coral."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
