The first thing you will need is a good graphics department. It used to be that a trusty pentangle or inverted crucifix would do the trick, but in our branding-conscious age, horror movies must try harder. It seems no modern-day chiller is complete without its bespoke symbol, usually signifying an ancient secret society or some other form of unspeakable, but easily drawable, evil. Something that would look good on a T-shirt. Recent history is garlanded with examples: The Blair Witch Project\u2019s \u201cstick man\u201d; the similar design in Ben Wheatley\u2019s Kill List. Sinister gave us the \u201cBughuul\u201d symbol; Devil\u2019s Due the Antichrist gateway; and 13 Ghosts a selection of \u201cBlack Zodiac\u201d signs. This week, we\u2019ve got Brightburn. This fusion of Superman and The Omen centres on a strangely powerful boy-who-fell-to-Earth called Brandon. He creates his own logo: a double diamond based on his initials. He\u2019s so proud of it that he scribbles it in notebooks, on windows and at the scene of his crimes. We will soon have more glyphs to glean in Midsommar, Ari Aster\u2019s much-anticipated follow-up to Hereditary. Hereditary was already a classic example of what we might call \u201clogo horror\u201d. It made liberal use of a curlicued symbol that resembled an ornate wall-mounted coat-rack but was actually \u201cthe sigil of Paimon\u201d \u2013 what else? \u2013 signifying demonic cult membership. Aster is at it again with Midsommar. Set in sunny Sweden, it looks like a Wicker Man-style jaunt into folk horror. Its chief symbol, a triangle with circles at its bottom corners, will be familiar to actual Swedes: it is a pagan fertility symbol, often found atop maypoles (not to be confused with the Deathly Hallows from Harry Potter). And Midsommar\u2019s trailers are chock-full of other mysterious runes and symbols, some Norse-looking, others possibly made up. Fans are already poring over the images. This could be a dangerous avenue to head down: where rather than being stories to move us, movies become puzzles to solve. We have already had a warning this year: Under the Silver Lake, from the director of It Follows, in which a symbol sent Andrew Garfield on a mystical goose chase. Audiences had no inclination to follow. It is fine to add a deeper layer of symbolic meaning \u2013 as Hereditary and many other movies do. But when the symbolism becomes literal and overbearing, you risk going too far down the rabbit hole. Before you know it, you could be mainlining podcasts about \u201cIlluminati symbolism at the Met Gala\u201d or buying brain pills on Infowars. When you\u2019re a hammer, everything looks like a nail; when you\u2019re a conspiracy theorist, every triangle, circle and squiggle looks like evidence of a secret masterplan (that would also make a cool T-shirt). Brightburn is in UK cinemas from Wednesday 19 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
