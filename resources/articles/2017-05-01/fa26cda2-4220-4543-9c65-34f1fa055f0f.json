On an emotional night marked by Pablo Zabaleta\u2019s last home outing the victory, despite the fact that Arsenal also defeated Sunderland, means that if Pep Guardiola\u2019s side can win at Vicarage Road they will definitely claim third position ahead of Liverpool or Arsenal in the manager\u2019s first campaign, guaranteeing entry to the Champions League at the group stage. \u201cWe are third so it is in our hands to finish third,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cWe are going to play Watford and win the game. Of course, they [Arsenal] have to score five or six goals against Everton but now we will travel to London to win the game and finish third.\u201d Only a defeat coupled with a sizeable Arsenal win over Everton on Sunday could send City down to fifth. Guardiola had made two changes to the side which had beaten Leicester on Saturday, dropping Ga\u00ebl Clichy for Aleksandar Kolarov and Raheem Sterling for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, each of these players among the night\u2019s replacements. Tony Pulis made three changes as out went Gareth McAuley, James McClean and Sam Field, and in came Claudio Yacob, Marc Wilson and Nacer Chadli. On 11 minutes came am chorus of \u201cStand up if you love Pablo\u201d, and the Etihad rose to hail the departing full-back. Next the home fans appealed to Craig Pawson for a penalty after Leroy San\u00e9 went down as Allan Nyom challenged him but the referee was unmoved. Guardiola greeted a hopeful Kolarov punt with frustration as it was hardly the composed pass-and-move stuff he prefers. Yet the ball came to the outstanding Ag\u00fcero who, after a slip, played in San\u00e9. The German advanced along his left-hand channel then shot but missed, heightening Guardiola\u2019s annoyance. City took the lead via a slick move. Yaya Tour\u00e9 rolled the ball to Ag\u00fcero, he flicked delightfully on to Kevin De Bruyne who played in Jesus and no mistake was made. The goal broke the contest open as City doubled their advantage 106 seconds later. Once again Ag\u00fcero was involved as a link man, the ball passing through him before it eventually came to De Bruyne. The Belgian fired a rocket beyond Foster. It was the kind of cut-throat quality Guardiola complains is missing from his side. So the manager will have been delighted, but also possibly disappointed that this was only De Bruyne\u2019s sixth league strike. Vincent Kompany had limped for some of the opening half following a tackle so it was good news for City that he emerged for the second period. While a cheer as loud as those that followed each goal greeted Zabaleta\u2019s trot along the touchline to warm up, Pulis waited only seven minutes to make a change, swapping Wilson for McClean. City soon scored again, though, and it was simple. Tour\u00e9 played a one-two with Ag\u00fcero, who dinked another superb pass on, and the Ivorian slotted past Foster. Guardiola was effusive regarding Ag\u00fcero. \u201cGabriel was amazing but today the key player up front was Sergio. He didn\u2019t scored but he helped us to play the third man, he made two or three assists. He made an amazing, amazing performance. Sergio played, wow, like a long time I didn\u2019t see. He didn\u2019t score today but he helped us to make an assists, he made the assist for Kevin and the second one and third double pass with Yaya. \u201c It was a good night and it\u2019s in our hands to finish third, we go to London to win the game. It\u2019s not done, fourth, but Arsenal have to win five or 6-0, but we are there, we will travel and try to put in a good performance and win.\u201d At 3-0 up the City fans could sing \u201cwe want Pablo\u201d, and on the hour the fans got their wish. When Kompany was taken off Zabaleta was handed the armband in what was a classy touch. There was also a cuddle from David Silva and particular merriment when Zabaleta upended Salom\u00f3n R\u00f3ndon. Hal Robson-Kanu added a late consolation for West Brom and Guardiola added: \u201cOur performance was a resume of the year. We did well, created chances then conceded a goal and didn\u2019t score as many as we deserved. Our home season was not good. We finished the last three games with a good performance. We dropped a lot of points.\u201d When the final whistle came the send-off to Zabaleta began. For gifts the 32-year-old who was part of two title-winning sides was given a lifetime season ticket and shirt that read \u201cZabaleta 333\u201d, to mark his number of City appearances. He said: \u201cThis is probably the hardest moment in my City career for sure. It\u2019s been a wonderful nine years. Sometimes you have to make tough decisions and always think of the best for myself for my family and the club especially, I feel I have done enough. It\u2019s the right time for me to move on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
