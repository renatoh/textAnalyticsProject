The move follows three years of restructuring at the institute, which recently announced it was selling off the \u00a320m 1960s grade II listed building in Kensington as part of its policy to \"diversify its investments\". The building now operates on a commercial basis as a conference and exhibition centre. The institute was publicly funded by its member countries, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stopped the money three years ago when it became a charity. Judy Curry, the institute's finance director and company secretary, said the new centre would become the focus of the institute's education work. \"It's the end of the era in the sense that we will no longer be in this building, but we are widening our education remit now that we are no longer funded by the FCO. Our work will continue,\" she said. At the end of last year, former governors of the institute complained it was \"asset stripping\" after its main library was relocated to a poorly funded Commonwealth museum in Bristol. The education department was the last major project based in the Kensington building. The new centre will be housed in Cambridge University's school of education and will concentrate on research, educational leadership and project development in Commonwealth countries. Researchers at the centre will work to identify successful models of education within primary schools and then disseminate the material to other Commonwealth countries. The chairman of the institute, Judith Hanratty, welcomed the move, saying: \"Through the new centre in Cambridge, the institute will be better able to pursue its aim of meeting the educational needs of the countries of the Commonwealth by bringing together educational specialists from Commonwealth countries and leading academic experts in the field.\" Cambridge vice-chancellor Professor Sir Alec Broers added: \"Cambridge has a long association with the Commonwealth and with Commonwealth studies and we are proud to welcome this new centre to the university.\" The university already houses the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust, which provides financial help to students to study at the university, and The Royal Commonwealth Society Library."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
