It is a self portrait \u2013 one of many in this exhibition \u2013 but it is less an inward-looking meditation than a direct query of the viewer: are you a friend, or not? Sukumaran was arrested for heroin smuggling in Indonesia in 2005, part of the group of Australian smugglers who became known as the Bali Nine. He was executed by a firing squad in Indonesia on 29 April 2015, along with fellow smuggler Andrew Chan. Before his execution, Sukumaran spent a decade in Bali\u2019s Kerobokan prison fighting his sentence. It was there that he turned his attention to art, producing much of his body of work in the last few years of his life. His paintings, which became a rallying point for his supporters as his execution date loomed, have now become his aesthetic and political legacy. Another Day in Paradise is the first major study of that legacy. Curated by Sukumaran\u2019s friend and mentor, artist Ben Quilty, and Campbelltown Arts Centre director Michael Dagostino, this exhibition is not simply a showcase but a conversation about justice, humanity, state cruelty and capital punishment. The works are arranged in loose groupings that mirror the experience of long-term incarceration, while drawing into sharp focus the political context in which the artist\u2019s life was entangled. There are few landscapes in this collection; Sukumaran focused particularly on portraiture, taking as his subjects prison guards, other inmates, family members, friends, and of course, himself. They are inescapably political. The first suite of nine paintings, for example, features the Bali Nine. It is mirrored later by portraits of nine political leaders in whose hands Sukumaran\u2019s life rested, including three former Australian prime ministers. Quilty\u2019s influence on Sukumaran\u2019s brushwork and use of colour is obvious \u2013 generous, confident swathes of thick paint in a warm, earthy palette create an effect that is impressionistic rather than naturalistic. But Sukumaran\u2019s style is more angular than that of his mentor, and this has a striking effect on his portraiture, imbuing his subjects with startled, haunted expressions. Sukumaran\u2019s work on show here is interspersed by commissions from Australian artists Megan Cope, Jagarth Dheerasekera, Abdul-Rahman Abdullah, Taloi Havini, Khaled Sabsabi and Matthew Sleeth. Their installations provide contrast, commentary and an aesthetic counterpoint to Sukumaran\u2019s oils on canvas. Cope\u2019s contribution, for example \u2013 a bamboo barracoon, floor and roof woven from shredded legal documents \u2013 draws connections between the racism Sukumaran experienced as a child in Australia, his death in Indonesia, and the experience of Indigenous Australians at the hands of the state. But the true weight of the exhibition lies in Sukumaran\u2019s struggle to come to terms with the prospect of his own death. It is inescapably heavy subject matter. One suite entitled The Final 72 Hours, for example, features a selection of works from Sukumaran\u2019s time on Nusa Kambangan, where he and Chan were transferred to await execution. Among the 11 self-portraits is a painting of a heart: the muscle, not the motif. On the opposite wall hangs a painting of an AK47 \u2013 the kind of gun used in executions. The symbolism is obvious, but no less affecting for that. The inward focus of his self-portraiture is relentless, oppressive. Occasionally, it seems as if something breaks: a brush is drawn roughly down through carefully rendered features, blurring the portrait, like water over glass. It feels like frustration, or an erasure \u2013 of identity, of the self. In an exhibition so emotionally and politically charged, it is perhaps Sukumaran\u2019s jarring interventions into his own self-representation that are most unsettling. The final two works of Sukumaran\u2019s bring the story home, as symbolism gives way to direct appeals for humanity. An Indonesian flag dripping with red paint, the canvas itself smeared as if with blood, hangs from the ceiling in order to show its reverse side, signed by the nine people who faced execution on the same day. It is accompanied by a sketch of the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, with the words \u201cpeople can change\u201d written on the back. This is not an exhibition in which it is possible to separate the art from its context, or its politics. It is raw, rough, moving and necessary. \u2022 Myuran Sukumaran: Another Day in Paradise is showing at Campbelltown Arts Centre, Sydney, as part of Sydney festival until 26 March"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
