Diplomatic staff are to step up charges on drunken British visitors who rely on them to find their hotel, replace lost passports or bail them out with cash, as a boom in stag and hen parties fuelled by cheap flights makes Bratislava, rather than Brighton or Blackpool, a hip destination. The Foreign Office is backing a call by the Commons public accounts committee to extend charging to what one MP, Ian Davidson, who represents Glasgow South West, called \"drunks and halfwits\" at a rate of \u00a384.50 an hour. The Foreign Office estimates that 70% of all stag parties take place abroad, with Prague, Bratislava and Barcelona being among the most popular locations. So far officials rarely charge people for assistance - out of a total of 84,000 cases, the levy has been applied on 323 occasions and not consistently across the world, according to a report from MPs on the committee. In Prague, where stag night revellers count for one in seven lost passports, only 40 people have been charged. In Bratislava, Slovakia's capital - where cheap, strong beer is a big attraction - only two people have been charged. MPs were told by the Foreign Office in Prague, where there have been a few tragic accidents, that \"many partygoers turn up at the embassy out of hours, drunk, incoherent and lost\". Most are looked after by 24-hour security guards, who have been known to ring up to 40 hotels to discover where a lost stag-nighter might be staying. On more than one occasion, the friends of a reveller have refused to come to collect him, saying \"we are having such a good time in the pub\". In one instance, diplomatic staff had to release a stag-night reveller from airport police custody after he was found drunk wandering around aircraft hangers, saying he was trying to get on any plane to leave the country. The Foreign Office said it was rare \"to encounter a hen in trouble\". The committee chairman, Edward Leigh, Tory MP for Gainsborough, said: \"Where our nationals have landed themselves in trouble as a result of their own irresponsibility, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should not hesitate to charge them for its services.\" The MPs report coincides with a report from the online bank Egg, which shows that Britons spent \u00a3430m last year on trips abroad for stag and hen parties. Each person spends an average of \u00a3551. One in five partygoers will lose valuables, 10% will have items stolen, 17% will need medical attention after sports or drunken accidents, and 4% are likely to be arrested."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
