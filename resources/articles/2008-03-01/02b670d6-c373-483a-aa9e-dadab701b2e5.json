The first TV ad campaign, created by ad agency M&amp;C Saatchi, focuses on urging drivers to be more aware of an increase in motorcyclists on London's streets with the onset of spring. Launching this week, the first ad uses the strapline \"Give motorcyclists a second thought\". The first ad uses the image of an optical illusion to illustrate how the mind can be tricked by certain visual information. M&amp;C Saatchi's campaign points out that drivers often believe that small objects, such as motorcyclists, take longer to approach than bigger ones, such as cars. The TV ad is the first of three TV ad campaigns that are being run by the mayor and Transport for London. \"We are investing nearly \u00a350m on road safety this year, the most that has ever been invested, and this spring road safety campaign is part of this work, using innovative approaches to get messages across to road users about the need to take care on London's roads,\" said Livingstone. The other campaigns, following later in the month, will promote cycling safety and responsible driving among young drivers. \"This campaign highlights specific behaviours that lead to high incidences of collisions on London's roads involving vulnerable road users,\" said David Brown, Transport for London's managing director of surface transport. \"The campaign also targets young drivers by focusing on the consequences of driving unlicensed or uninsured, speeding and driving under the influence of drugs.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
