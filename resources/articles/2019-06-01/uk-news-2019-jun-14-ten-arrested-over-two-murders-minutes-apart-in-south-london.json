One man was stabbed to death in the street in Wandsworth, south-west London, shortly before 4.45pm, while another man was shot dead in Greenwich, south-east London, at about 5pm. Sadiq Khan, the city\u2019s mayor, expressed his disgust and said the Metropolitan police were working at their limit. \u201cI am sickened to hear that two young lives have been ended within minutes of each other \u2026 Our overstretched police are working around the clock to keep Londoners safe. They need our support to end this scourge of violence.\u201d He said anyone with information about either murder should contact the police. Scotland Yard said residents in both areas could expect to see a heightened police presence in the coming days as detectives from the homicide and major crime command investigated. Both victims died at the scene, but neither of them have yet been named. The victim in Wandsworth was 18, while the victim in Plumstead, Greenwich was 19. Officers said postmortem examinations would be carried out soon and that the victims\u2019 next of kins had been informed. They have not linked the two cases. Armed police responded to the incident in Greenwich and Scotland Yard said three males, one aged 17, two aged 16, and a woman who is 17-years old were arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to separate south London police stations for questioning. DI John Marriott appealed for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of Plumstead railway station in south-east London at around 5pm on Friday to contact police. \u201cThe shooting took place not far from Plumstead railway station and I would urge anyone who was commuting to or from this station to speak with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was also sunny at the time and a number of people would have been enjoying the weather in the area of Plumstead Gardens; I need you to come forward.\u201d Officers said they had arrested six males, aged between 16 and 19 years old, in the Wandsworth case and taken them for questioning. Supt Richard Smith, from the south-west command unit, said: \u201cThe events of yesterday afternoon are a stark reminder that carrying a knife can easily result in the taking of someone\u2019s life. \u201cOfficers will be patrolling the area throughout the weekend and are available to speak to residents if they have any concerns, or wish to pass on any information regarding the murder or any other issues in the local area. \u201cI would urge those who witnessed the incident, but who have yet to speak with officers, to please come forward and provide us with any information that you can.\u201d A witness who lives locally said: \u201cI walked past at 2.30pm and I didn\u2019t see anything, but when I came back from work at 5.30pm it was all going on. \u201cI walked past, I saw what looked like the body on the floor covered in a bag and there were 50 people around, loads of people, two or three ambulances.\u201d Elsewhere, in nearby Clapham, three men were found with stab and slash injuries in the early hours of Saturday. The condition of two of the men is unknown, while the third has injuries which are not life-threatening or life-changing. Four men were arrested in connection with the incident \u2013 two for violent disorder, one for carrying a bladed instrument and another for possession of a laser gun \u2013 and taken into custody at a south London police station. In April, it emerged that homicides across England and Wales had reached their highest level in a decade, with a third of various knife offences being recorded in London. Nationally, instances of knife crimes had increased by 6% in 2018 on the previous year and the Office for National Statistics said the use of bladed weapons was concentrated in urban areas, though there were some signs the increase was slowing. The ONS also said there had been a 2% increase in the same period in instances of firearm offences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
