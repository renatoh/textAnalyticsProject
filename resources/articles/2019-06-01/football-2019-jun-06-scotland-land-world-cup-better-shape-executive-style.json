Before the first minister facilitated the funding that has enabled all part\u2011time players in Scotland\u2019s World Cup squad to take six-month sabbaticals from their day jobs, the Glasgow City full\u2011back routinely got up at 5.45am. There was a gym session before leaving for work in Edinburgh caring for dementia patients and then a drive for evening training at Glasgow City but, thanks to Sturgeon, Docherty and her teammates have arrived in Nice virtually unrecognisable from the team who lost 6-0 to England at Euro 2017. \u201cNicola Sturgeon\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Docherty said as she relaxed in the team hotel just off the Promenade des Anglais on Thursday. \u201cShe\u2019s been a great support and we\u2019re all buzzing that she\u2019s coming to the game on Sunday.\u201d That match is England v Scotland in Nice and Docherty senses revenge in the balmy Mediterranean air. \u201cI was sitting on the couch at home for the 6-0,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a massive difference now. We had a lot of injuries two years ago but we\u2019ve got a new coach [Shelley Kerr] now and a different style of play. We\u2019re also properly fit. For the last six months I\u2019ve been getting proper recovery and sleep. I\u2019m no longer rushing home to Falkirk and then eating during the drive to training.\u201d This brave new world assumed a new dimension as Kerr\u2019s squad flew to Nice on a private jet \u2013 \u201cit was surreal,\u201d said Docherty \u2013 and received pre-departure pep talks from not just Sturgeon but also tennis\u2019s Judy Murray and Steve Clarke, the Scotland men\u2019s manager. \u201cYou could walk around on the plane doing what you like and then, at the hotel here, we were welcomed by a group of children singing a special song they\u2019d written for us.\u201d Something similar happened when Phil Neville\u2019s squad checked into a slightly more opulent base a long goalkick down the sea front but Docherty refuses to be overawed by her high-profile neighbours. \u201cEngland are a great team,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019re unbeatable.\u201d With the eyes of the world on her, the 26-year-old may soon finally be able to fulfil her long-term ambition. \u201cMy job is about visiting people with dementia, making them a cup of tea, having a chat and making them feel they can be in their own homes. I\u2019m there to give the families respite. One of the reasons I went into it is because my grandpa had dementia so I know how hard it is. There are difficult parts but it\u2019s also satisfying because you put smiles on people\u2019s faces. I enjoy my work but to play full-time is everybody\u2019s dream.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
