He\u2019s acknowledging a slightly awkward atmosphere that initially permeates London\u2019s sweaty Scala, tonight decorated to look like a sad-sack student union club-night in line with Ronson\u2019s new album of \u201csad bangers\u201d, Late Night Feelings. This is a DJ set with guest appearances, not a gig, but one that features a recent Oscar-winner (for his work on Lady Gaga\u2019s Shallow) with a near-immaculate CV stuffed with modern pop\u2019s biggest practitioners. While he eschews the attention-grabbing antics of fellow producer/DJ Diplo, who he recently collaborated with as Silk City, people are here to see him no matter how sheepish he looks. He relaxes into it quickly, however, opening with Ann Peebles\u2019 I Can\u2019t Stand the Rain, which, rather than speeding up into Missy Elliott\u2019s The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly), a 1997 hit that utilised the original\u2019s drip-drop beat, morphs into his emo collaboration with Camila Cabello, Find U Again. In fact, the set works best when Ronson chucks in surprises: when the sad disco of the new album\u2019s Lykke Li-assisted title track transforms into the euphoric Magician remix of Li\u2019s I Follow Rivers, or when the set slows and Ronson celebrates his most fertile creative relationship by playing Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black. That song is preceded by one of the two guests, with powerhouse new vocalist Yebba bringing some much needed IRL heartache to the excellent Don\u2019t Leave Me Lonely. King Princess, meanwhile, is introduced to the stage for the album\u2019s Pieces of Us only to ignore the singing bit to slurp from an energy drink, vape furiously and ask the crowd: \u201cAre there any gays here?\u201d It\u2019s not the night\u2019s only odd moment, either, thanks to an awful chopped and screwed remix of Shallow that feels endless. Ronson\u2019s on much safer ground mixing Dolly Parton\u2019s Jolene into the Miley Cyrus collaboration Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, ending proceedings with a very on-trend country hoedown \u2013 bleeding into Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road because, well, 2019. As an escapist hour celebrating and revelling in loss it\u2019s a success, but you can\u2019t shake the feeling there\u2019s an absence at the heart of it all. Though perhaps, given the mood of the album, that was the point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
