With his seventh Budget - making him the longest-serving chancellor since Lloyd George - Mr Brown was forced to announce increased borrowing and downgraded growth, as most economists had predicted. Growth for this year has been downgraded to 2-2.5% and borrowing up to \u00a327bn from \u00a324.5bn, although the chancellor reaffirmed his 3-3.5% growth prediction for 2004. Breaking the cross-party political consensus which has dampened parliament since the outbreak of hostilities in the Gulf, the Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, said the Budget was \"characterised by what it conceals, rather than what it confirms\". But with last year's Budget announcing a 1p hike in national insurance contributions, the huge increases in health and education spending unveiled in last summer's comprehensive spending review, and the revised borrowing estimates admitted in the autumn's pre-Budget report, today's statement was always going to be appear something of an anti-climax. And the most potentially explosive and exciting economic issue - the euro - was tossed aside, with Mr Brown merely confirming that a decision on the five economic tests will be presented to parliament by the first week of June. Perhaps the most radical single measure was the unveiling of a new child trust fund - the so-called \"baby bond\" - of \u00a3250 each for the 700,000 babies born in the UK every year, realisable at 18 and to be topped up by parents and grandparents. Babies of poorer parents will receive \u00a3500. The scheme, backdated to September 2002, was originally floated by the Blair-friendly Institute for Public Policy Research before the last general election, but was put on the backburner by the Treasury. It comes just three days after Mr Brown and his wife, Sarah, announced they were expecting another baby, after the death of their premature infant Jennifer last year. For smokers and drinkers, a pint will rise by 1p, wine by 4p and cigarettes by 8p a packet. Road tax for cars will go up \u00a35, in line with inflation, but will be frozen for vans and lorries. In a small concession to pressure from homeowners in the south-east, the threshold for inheritance tax on property will rise from \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3255,000. Stamp duty was also frozen. However, business loopholes which cost the Treasury up to \u00a310bn a year on \"leasing\" properties will be closed. Air passenger duty and the climate change levy were frozen, to the disappointment of environmentalists - who had hoped the government would expand on its green agenda. Corporation and income taxes were also frozen, as was VAT. But, as usual, the chancellor ensured a \"feelgood factor\" on his own backbenches by announcing the scrapping of \"hotel charges\" - cash deducted from the pension to pay for hospital meals and accommodation for old age pensioners. However, Mr Brown was barracked by opposition MPs as he insisted his \"golden rule\" - where borrowing is used only for investment - would not be broken. On the war, Mr Brown did not go beyond the \u00a33bn already pledged - roughly equivalent to a penny on income tax, with a further pledge to \"spend what it takes\" to depose Saddam Hussein. Mr Brown also gave David Blunkett, the home secretary, an additional \u00a3330m for counter terrorism measures. He pledged \u00a3240m for reconstruction in Iraq, and a pledge to \"overhaul\" the EU aid budget. In fact, this Budget was delayed from its traditional March date until April - after the start of the new financial year and in the lead-up to the Scottish and Welsh elections - after the initial Downing Street expectation that the war in Iraq would by now be largely over. Following the precedent of the Treasury-commissioned Wanless report into the NHS, Mr Brown announced two new academic studies - one from Imperial College into long term fixed rate mortgages, as is more common on the continent, and another by Birmingham University into public and private sector relocation. He also announced new regional price indices to reflect varying costs across the country, and a mooted change to a G7-style index of consumer prices instead of the current retail price index measure of inflation. Announcing incremental changes to the benefits system, the chancellor declared: \"Tax credits are the modern route to eradicating poverty by making work pay.\" For the first time, local job centres will be given discretion over grants and training to job seekers, while incapacity benefit will be raised and admission for skilled migrants made easier. There will be improved research and development tax credits for businesses, especially in the field of IT investment. Although not directly the Treasury's responsibility, council tax has gone up by an average of 13% this year - a further political factor Mr Brown needed to take into account in this year's equations. Mr Brown delivered the 58-minute speech in his usual machinegun style delivery, flanked by the prime minister and the rest of the front bench. As with all Budgets, there was much re-announcing of past measures, and much that will only emerge over the next few days from scrutiny of the small print. The Commons will now debate the finance bill, of which the Budget is effectively the opening statement, until Monday. The debate will be wound up by the shadow chancellor, Michael Howard, for the opposition, while Mr Duncan Smith had the unenviable task of an immediate, improvised response as the chancellor sat down. Today's starting time of 12.30pm, rather than the traditional 3.30pm, was the first under the new working hours brought in by the former Commons leader, Robin Cook."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
