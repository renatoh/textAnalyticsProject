Well, they could do. For the winners of Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup second round replay between Newport County and Plymouth Argyle, the spoils are a third round tie at Liverpool. A share of gate receipts and TV revenue could mean either League Two side earning close to \u00a3500,000 as well as the chance of a footballing lifetime in facing J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Premier League title contenders. It\u2019s no wonder some people are getting a little anxious at the prospect. \u201cFunnily enough, I\u2019m getting married next week but I\u2019m a lot more nervous about the match,\u201d says Newport\u2019s co-chairman Gavin Foxall. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of reasons. Firstly, the prize for the winning side is a trip to a club that Newport County have never played before, an enormous occasion for players and fans alike. Secondly, for a club like us, the financial perspective almost makes or breaks a season. \u201cWe turn over \u00a32m a year but if we beat Plymouth, the next match could be worth anything up to half a milllion for us. That\u2019s a massive boost in terms of capital injection. I did explain this to my fiancee, and told her I might get a bit agitated, but she knows what football entails.\u201d For Derek Adams, the Plymouth manager, the motivations are similar. While he says there is no pressure on his side to advance, he too acknowledges that the prospect of a tie at Anfield is a big deal for his club. \u201cArgyle have been through difficult times for a number of years and hopefully we\u2019re coming out the other end of it now,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s always nice to think that there\u2019s a financial reward for winning. It\u2019s a big game, it\u2019s an FA Cup replay but at the end of it all what both teams really want is Liverpool at Anfield. It\u2019s a venue most players would love to play at.\u201d Argyle currently sit at the top of League Two, while County are bottom and battling to stay in the division, but neither Adams not Foxall sees this tie as a distraction from more pressing concerns. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re at the bottom of the league and we could do with a boost,\u201d says Foxall. \u201cIf you\u2019re a League Two side, or even League One, how often do you get the chance to be pitched against Liverpool or another big side? In reality, it\u2019s not going to happen in the league. At the same time, it\u2019s taken us 25 years to get back into the Football League and it\u2019s an absolute must for us to stay up. We\u2019re not adrift by any stretch and hopefully a win in this tie can help put us where we need to be.\u201d The first match between these teams took place at Home Park at the beginning of the month and could be counted as a moral victory for County, who held the Pilgrims to a goalless draw despite being reduced to 10 men for 70 minutes. \u201cThey defended very well on the day,\u201d says Adams of a frustrating result for his side. \u201cWe were unable to get the goal our play deserved. We had opportunities we didn\u2019t take and we\u2019ve got to make sure we take any that come our way tomorrow night.\u201d Plymouth will be taking a travelling support of more than 1,000 to south Wales, to a Rodney Park stadium that has been beset by problems this season. A lack of efficient drainage has led to three of Newport\u2019s home games being postponed, but a late intervention by the club in conjunction with the FA has meant the pitch will now be protected by an inflatable cover. \u201cWe\u2019ve been building up to this game since the weekend \u2013 Graham Westley takes things on a game by game basis and wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d says Foxall of his manager. \u201cBut our supporters believe this is a must-win game. We\u2019ve incentivised the match so that anyone who attends has the chance to buy a ticket for Anfield if we get there. We\u2019ve had a steady flow of sales and while we don\u2019t want massive queues if we can avoid it, tickets will be available right up to kick-off.\u201d After the queues have died down and the game is over, Foxall can return to planning his wedding. As for Adams, is he at all excited about the prospect of locking horns with Klopp? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get through the tie, that\u2019s our main focus first,\u201d is his thoroughly diplomatic response."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
