It wasn\u2019t very fun. But I\u2019ve always managed to make feelgood music regardless of whether I\u2019m feeling good \u2013 perhaps that\u2019s set me in good stead for where we are now. I have been trying to achieve something every day, even if that is just a big cycle ride. I\u2019ve been doing cover versions or jamming on the guitar, and putting them on YouTube. And I want to get into film scoring \u2013 I now have so much time, it\u2019s something I want to work on as a craft. Maybe it\u2019s because everything seems so dramatic right now that film scores sound so good. So I\u2019ve been listening to Hans Zimmer\u2019s Inception soundtrack. I\u2019m hearing what\u2019s possible within an orchestra \u2013 and Zimmer\u2019s technique: a theme will come back to create emotion. I love \u00d3lafur Arnalds, too, an Icelandic composer. When he mics up a piano you hear the movement of the pedals, you can hear him breathing. He also manages to keep things very simple but effective. I\u2019m constantly listening to Radiohead \u2013 I love Weird Fishes/Arpeggi. On my new record with Yussef Dayes, the phrase \u201cthat\u2019s a bit Radiohead-y\u201d came out a lot. It\u2019s the choice of chords, and that particular vocal style: very spacey, ethereal, long held notes in falsetto. I\u2019m loving a track called Make It Live Forever by Knxwledge, it\u2019s raw samples he has chopped and processed in his own way, to sound like an 80s disco track slowed down. And Tame Impala dropped his new album recently, which I like, but I went back to his early stuff \u2013 Apocalypse Dreams on Lonerism is so feelgood and dreamy. He is a studio legend \u2013 his live drums sound like samples \u2013 and I\u2019m always trying to work out how he does his stuff. I get to the point where I don\u2019t even realise how much I\u2019m nerding out. I\u2019ll mention something to my girlfriend about a track and she\u2019ll be like: what are you on about? That\u2019s the biggest education as a musician, just listening. \u2022 What Kinda Music by Tom Misch and Yussuf Dayes is released on 24 April on Blue Note/Caroline"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
