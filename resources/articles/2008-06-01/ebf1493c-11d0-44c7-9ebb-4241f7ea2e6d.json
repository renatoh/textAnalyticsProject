But it's not a conservation centre. It's a primary and junior school. Brill Church of England school in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, this week won the Teaching Awards 2008 south of England region sustainable schools heat. The energy Brill saves with its alternative sources helps keep the school's swimming pool open for community use. Its 180 pupils are sold only snacks that come in natural wrappers and staff buy only fair trade products for the school. A shop selling ecological goods is on the site. If that weren't enough, pupils are elected by their classmates to sit on an eco-council responsible for eco-activities in the school. The other winners in the south of England heats were equally impressive. They include Meeghan Tearle, a science and advanced skills teacher at Cantell Maths and Computing college, who wins the Guardian award for secondary teacher of the year. Tearle's students say she has the \"triple X factor\". Her colleagues agree. Stuart Parkes, Cantell's assistant head, says Tearle is the most outstanding teacher he has worked with in 12 years in the profession. The judges praised her for creating stimulating, fun and engaging lessons. It's not always all about learning. Before Gareth Evans arrived at Lakeside school in Hampshire, few boys left with qualifications. Evans, who won secondary headteacher of the year, has turned that around and the majority now leave with eight or more GCSEs. But a parent also has heartfelt praise for Evans: \"I would not be exaggerating if I told you he helped me more than anything else to save our family life.\" Winner of the special needs teacher of the year is Freya Newberry. \"I used to be scared of reading, but I enjoy it now,\" says one of her pupils. Newberry works with students who have physical disabilities or behaviour problems at Ringwood secondary school in Hampshire. One pupil says: \"She always knows what to say to ensure I leave her room with a smile.\" Rob Gallop, winner of the south of England heats for primary school teacher of the year, was described to judges as not only the pillar of the school community but the \"soul and driving heartbeat within it\". \"He shows you how to do it and how to remember it,\" says a pupil at Hampshire's St James Church of England primary. Winner of the primary headteacher of the year was Peter Farrington, of the Prince of Wales school in Dorchester. Farrington's is the only school in Dorset to have a unit for children with physical disabilities. His pupils go on night-time walks or abseil in wheelchairs. Then there's Phillip Sales, winner of outstanding new teacher of the year. Sales took his year 6 at St Mary's Church of England primary, in Dorset, sailing before their Sats exams to clear their heads. Despite still being a newly qualified teacher (NQT), he's been put in charge of year 6. The highest accolade - the Ted Wragg award for lifetime achievement - went to John Thompson, deputy head of St Michael's Church of England primary in Bracknell, Berkshire. Thompson has seen three generations of families at his school. \"He knows how to push the right buttons of today's children,\" parents and colleagues say.
