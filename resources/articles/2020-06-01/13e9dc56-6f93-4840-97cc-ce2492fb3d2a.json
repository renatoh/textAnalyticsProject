During the solstice, the Australasian Dark Sky Alliance are calling on would-be stargazers to engage in a citizen science project as night falls. The project aims to map and measure the level of light pollution across the country, while at the same time attempting to break a Guinness World Record for \u201cMost users to take an online environmental sustainability lesson in 24 hours\u201d. To take part, people will be asked to step outside and count the number of stars they see in the Southern Cross constellation. Participants can register their interest and contribute to the project on the World Light Record website. Marnie Ogg, the CEO and founder of the Australasian Dark Sky Alliance, says that the project will be particularly good for families. Ogg says that at present, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a baseline measurement\u201d when it comes to light pollution in Australia. While it is possible to track light pollution through satellite imagery, we do not have an understanding of \u201chow much light there is on the ground\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking through a shield of light pollution, you\u2019re going to see less stars,\u201d she says. \u201cAt times we\u2019ve looked at the Southern Cross from the steps of the Opera House and only seen three stars.\u201d She quips \u201cit\u2019s more like the southern triangle \u2026 But if you\u2019re deep in the heart of country New South Wales or outback Australia you might even have trouble working out where the Southern Cross is, because there\u2019s so many stars around it.\u201d She says that while astronomers have known that light pollution has an impact on the visibility of stars for hundreds of years, ecologists are now beginning to understand \u201chow much it impacts our wildlife\u201d. Even plants are impacted by how much light pollution there is on the ground. In addition to helping with the mapping project, Ogg recommends that people can easily reduce light pollution by only using light when it\u2019s really needed (\u201cdo you really need to light the palm tree up at 3am?\u201d), switching to amber-coloured light globes \u2013 which place less stress on the environment because they do not mimic daylight the way bright, white light does \u2013 and using blockout blinds. \u201cWe have plastics that are going to take hundreds of years to remove from the environment,\u201d says Ogg. \u201cBut literally as soon as you turn off that light switch you remove that source of stress in the natural environment. \u201cThe thing that I love most about talking about light pollution is that it\u2019s easily eradicated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
