Price has come under pressure after it was revealed that he billed the US government $400,000 for private flights instead of commercial travel. The scandal, which has also seen the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, come under scrutiny, has raised the ire of Donald Trump. On Wednesday the president said he was \u201cnot happy\u201d with Price regarding his private travel. Politico first reported that Price was using private charter airplanes instead of commercial flights. The health department\u2019s inspector general is reviewing the issue. In a statement released on Thursday, Price said: \u201cToday, I will write a personal check to the US treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes. The taxpayers won\u2019t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.\u201d He added: \u201cI will take no more private charter flights as secretary of HHS. No exceptions.\u201d Price will only reimburse the government for his share of the private travel \u2013 $51,887.37 \u2013 not the full cost of the flights. In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said: \u201cWhat the secretary has done is say that while all of this travel was approved by legal and HHS officials, the secretary has heard the taxpayers\u2019 concerns and wants to be responsive to them. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s taking the unprecedented step of reimbursing the government for his share of the travel. Secretary Price will write a personal check to the US Treasury for $51,887.31. The taxpayers won\u2019t pay a dime for his seats on charter planes.\u201d In his statement, the former Georgia congressman said: \u201cI regret the concerns this has raised regarding the use of taxpayer dollars. All of my political career I\u2019ve fought for the taxpayers. It is clear to me that in this case, I was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer.\u201d Price\u2019s flights, which included two trips to locations where he owns property, became a political flashpoint on Capitol Hill. The Iowa Republican senator Charles Grassley sent a letter to the White House asking for information on the use of private airplanes by Price and several other cabinet members. The House oversight committee, meanwhile, sent a letter to 24 government agencies regarding the use of \u201cprivate non-commercial travel for official reasons\u201d. Before his appointment to Trump\u2019s cabinet, Price served 12 years in Congress, representing suburban Atlanta. While on Capitol Hill, the former orthopedic surgeon was a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act and a leading Republican voice on health policy issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
