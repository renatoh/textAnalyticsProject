But she is as enthusiastic about her new launch, stuffyourrucksack.com, as she is about kestrels. \"I've done a lot of travelling in the developing world through my job and I'd get to a school or an orphanage and they wouldn't have something very simple like maps or exercise books. I used to kick myself because invariably these were things lying around at home that I could easily have stuffed in my own rucksack.\" In particular her idea was generated by a journey in 1999 when she visited an oasis village 200km north of Timbuktu. \"Having spent 35 days crossing the Sahara I visited a school where the children wanted to know how long it would take for me to get home \u2013 in camel days. I drew lines in the sand, but when I discovered they had no concept of the sea, I realised we wouldn't get far without a world map. I would have brought one with me if I'd known.\" Humble had hit on the fact that so many people who travel to the developing world want to do, or rather bring, the right thing but are hamstrung by their lack of local knowledge and wary of dumping unwanted gifts on communities. She decided to develop a website that would replace the doubt with certainty and provide a stream of helpful resources to grassroots projects across the world. Clicking on her online map tells you that if you venture to Tibet, for instance, you'd need pencils and toothbrushes; in Rajasthan a project could do with aprons and a dental kit: all highly rucksack compatible.
