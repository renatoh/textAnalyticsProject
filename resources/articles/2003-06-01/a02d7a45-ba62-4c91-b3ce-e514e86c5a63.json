He's in the mid-90s there to Trescothick, who's content to watch the bullets whistle past his off stump before nibbling at a couple. The man most in danger is Pakistan's wicket-keeper, Rashid Latif, who almost breaks his back as he leaps athletically to take the ball over his head. Shoaib slips in two wides past the off stump, and isn't pleased by umpire Mallender's calls. We were talking about West Midlands cooking before the break between innings. I'm afraid the conversation has barely moved on. Here's Paul Roberts. \"At the risk of further insult from my colleague Mr James Kirkaldy (a man with no hair to speak of whatsoever), may I put forward the humble faggot as a Black Country culinary masterpiece?\" You may, Paul. 2nd over: England 5-0 (Trescothick 1, Solanki 1) Solanki runs his first ball from Mohammad Sami to third man for a single, before slipping in the third wide to Trescothick. Pakistan might be trying to tempt him, but the plan has backfired so far. Trescothick gets off the mark from his 11th ball, dropping a single into the gully and setting off for a quick single. William de Quetteville thinks this is a game of poker. \"Ah-ha,\" he begins. \"I see your Eric Forth and raise you a Gordon Brown. Not only have I listened to him hold forth about the world economy in a speech at the Euromoney conference this week, I was almost run down by Clare Short on my way out.\" 3rd over: England 23-0 (Trescothick 14, Solanki 1) Shoaib, going round the wicket, overpitches and Trescothick hammers him through the covers - shot! The next ball isn't quite as full, but Trescothick repeats the dose. Shoaib goes back over the wicket, bowls a dot ball, but is then creamed behind point by Trescothick for four more. Great stuff! The next ball is a horror wide down the leg side that flies at nearly 99mph over Latif's head and away for five extras. Trescothick cuts the fifth for a single to third man, and that's 18 off the over. \"I predict we will lose,\" says Frank Black with a dash of native optimism. \"Horribly. That is all.\" 4th over: England 37-0 (Trescothick 26, Solanki 1) A bowling change already as Azhar Mahmood replaces Mohammad Sami, who will presumably come on at the other end in place of the wayward Shoaib. But Mahmood fares little better. His second ball dribbles away for two leg-byes, and his third is battered through the covers for four as Trescothick uses his feet. Two balls later, Trescothick scythes Mahmood in front of point for his fifth boundary. The crowd are cheering every stroke, and they're in seventh heaven as Trescothick lifts the final ball over extra cover for four more. What a start - 32 off the last two overs! \"Talking of cuisine,\" writes Tom Banks, with the smoothness of a Radio 5 Live link man, \"is it just me or was anyone else fed spam fritters at school? Disgusting.\" I used to go for the toad-in-the-hole option, Tom. 5th over: England 42-0 (Trescothick 26, Solanki 5) The carnage continues as Solanki pulls Sami through square leg for four. Sami follows up with a leg-side wide, and England are cruising at eight an over. \"Surely the Balti Pie has to be included in any round up of West Midlands cooking,\" suggests Chris Jones. \"It's the only reason I went to an away game at West Brom a few seasons ago (believe me, quality of pie was infinitely better than quality of football).\" You don't need to persuade me, Chris. 6th over: England 50-0 (Trescothick 33, Solanki 5) Fine leg is up, but Mahmood strays onto Trescothick's hips, which is just asking for trouble. Trescothick obliges by helping the ball on its way to the fine-leg rope. Then, a moment of luck. Trescothick top-edges a hook, which swirls tantalisingly in the air above long leg. Shoaib Malik runs round, dives, but can't hold on to what would have been a blinder. Trescothick takes three to bring up the England 50 in 35 balls. \"The ability to recognise pork scratchings as one of life's great wonders is a key life skill,\" says Andrea Lowe. \"Along with 'Bovril or Marmite?', a person's views on scratchings is probably the most important question one can ask of any prospective partner or housemate.\" You lead a simple life, don't you Andrea? 7th over: England 67-0 (Trescothick 49, Solanki 5) So, Trescothick is out of touch is he? He follows a straight-drive for four off Sami, with a flash through point next ball for four more. That's nine boundaries in his first 30 balls. Pakistan don't know where to bowl to him, and just to emphasise the point, Trescothick leans back to guide Sami over the slips for a very deliberate and stylish four. Sami follows that with a no-ball, before Trescothick steers the next ball to third man for four more. Outstanding! That's 17 off the over. \"Faggots, they're bostin!\" writes Rich Newbold with an enthusiasm that should probably worry me more than it does. \"I've been a vegetarian for the best part of 17 years but my first 'slippage', if it happened, would be an eight-pack of Mr.Brain's best.\" There aren't many foodstuffs I won't touch, Rich, but Mr Brain's produce is right up there. 8th over: England 75-0 (Trescothick 53, Solanki 8) On comes the offspinner, Mohammad Hafeez, who starts with a leg-side wide to Solanki. Then, another moment of luck for England. Solanki edges a drive that cannons off Latif's gloves and just out of reach of Younis Khan at first slip. The batsmen pinch three. Trescothick leans back to cut Hafeez for four, which takes him to a half-century in 37 balls, including 12 fours. Andrew Darbyshire wants to play a game. \"I propose that as readers start to filter back from the pub, we find out who's had the most booze then gone back to their desk. I'll start the bidding at a girly two and a half pints of lager. Though I wasn't even trying.\" Yeah. Right. 9th over: England 81-0 (Trescothick 58, Solanki 8) Back comes Shoaib, who can't believe it when Trescothick edges him through second slip and away for four. Second slip had been taken out the previous ball, and duly returns for the next. Horse and bolted springs to mind. Pakistan needs wickets. They need lots of them, and they need them fast. \"I want to disagree with Frank Black,\" says Lee Johnson, \"but I can't if he's THE Frank Black from the Pixies. I could never disagree with a man who wrote 'Oh My Golly' and Alec Eiffel and various other songs about space and time.\" I'm guessing he's not, Lee. 10th over: England 92-0 (Trescothick 69, Solanki 8) Oh my word! Trescothick drives Hafeez's first ball through extra cover for four, then lifts his third high over long-off for six. This is vintage Tresco! A flick for one to square leg gives him the strike for the next over. Solanki is just a bystander. \"I noticed they were talking of gherkins on Radio 4 in the last over,\" reports Tim Houghton. \"Jumping on the culinary bandwagon, I suspect.\" They're shamless., I'm afraid, Tom. It's not the first time this has happened. 11th over: England 105-0 (Trescothick 82, Solanki 8) Shoaib's first ball to Trescothick disappears through midwicket for four, and his third is helped, Adam Gilchrist-style, over third man for six! Amazing! That's the England 100, and Solanki, who has faced just 16 balls, has eight of them. Trescothick then keeps the strike in style, with a chop for three. Benjamin Sutherland is surely having a laugh. \"Did you know that Toad In The Hole gets its name from an experiment in Victorian times to cover toads in plastic to see if they could live forever? It all happened after a live pterodactyl was found in France after a boulder was blown up. Can anyone beat this for today's top true story?\" I'd really be very surprised, Ben. WICKET! Trescothick c Rashid Latif b Abdul Razzaq 86 (109-1) The ball after flaying Razzaq through the covers for four, Trescothick top-edges a pull and is caught by the wicket-keeper. He troops off to a standing ovation, having clobbered 86 in 55 balls with 16 fours and two sixes (that's 76 runs in boundaries). What an innings! Ok, so the game's all but over, but that was worth watching. Here's Keith Wright. \"In parts of Tipton it is possible to purchase \"Grey Peas &amp; Bacon\". God knows what \"Grey Peas\"are, perhaps they only grow in the Black Country, like fluorescent orange chips.\" 12th over: England 109-1 (Solanki 8, Vaughan 0) Phew! That was one of the great one-day knocks. Maybe Solanki will get some of the strike now. 13th over: England 117-1 (Solanki 8, Vaughan 8) Michael Vaughan gets going with a dreamy drive through extra cover for four off the suffering Shoaib. He repeats the shot two balls later and Vaughan has already drawn level with poor old Solanki, who is in danger of being there at the end with an unbeaten 17. James Kirkaldy is getting restless. \"Since this is rapidly degenerating into a forum for departmental bickering,\" he observes, \"can I point out that my having no hair is a clipper-related choice, whilst Mr Roberts' hairiness is a Chewbacca related (which he may well be) affliction. Furthermore, to throw a potential spanner in the works, does anyone actually have any proof that the pork scratching is a West Midlands invention. Coming from the UK's pork capital, Wiltshire, I would like to see a little more evidence to back up all this big Birmingham talk.\" I ask you. 14th over: England 125-1 (Solanki 14, Vaughan 9) Good for Solanki. Razzaq drifts onto his pads, and Solanki whips him high over midwicket for four. You shudder to think what total England might have made if they'd batted first. \"Even though I live in the Black Country I agree with you about Brains's Faggot,\" writes Stewart Dillon. \"They sell them in the local Everything For A Pound shop.\" 15th over: England 131-1 (Solanki 19, Vaughan 9) It never rains etc. Solanki is caught behind, but umpire Mallender calls no-ball. Replays shows Shoaib overstepped by three inches. Next ball, Solanki edges Shoaib at head height to Younis Khan at first slip, but the ball's going like a bullet and nearly takes Khan's block off on the way to the boundary. To his credit, Shoaib simply smiles. It hasn't been Pakistan's day. \"I had two pints and two glasses of wine,\" writes James Hankins in response to Andrew Darbyshire's booze challenge. \"My boss suggested cocktails but I've left him to it.\" Eh? 16th over: England 137-1 (Solanki 24, Vaughan 9) This game is drifting now to its inevitable conclusion, so it's worth saying that England have played very well indeed. They bowled superbly to limit Pakistan to 185 on a wicket as flat as this, and the batting of Trescothick was on another planet. Razzaq throws in a couple of excellent yorkers, but Solanki is watchful. \"I can't beat Andrew's two and a half pints, having had a pint less myself,\" writes Joshua Hardie, \"but I happen to know that our Finance Director had four and is right now pretending to do the accounts while reading this. Stop dribbling, Richard, it's ugly.\" Nice. WICKET! Vaughan c Younis Khan b Shoaib Akhtar 10 (143-2) Vaughan edges Shoaib low to slip, where Younis Khan holds on very well just in front of him. Vaughan stands his ground for a moment, wondering whether the ball carried, but a nod of the head from umpire hair sends him on his way. It seems we really are a nation of incorrigible boozers. \"Three pints of cider for me,\" admits Simon Jones. \"Although my record is six - I went home early that afternoon as my monitor refused to come into focus.\" 18th over: England 146-2 (Solanki 30, Troughton 0) Things have gone a little quiet here - the calm after the storm. A tidy over, that, from Razzaq. On the subject of wacky facts, here's Paul Mackay. \"Jacques Cousteau once found a 500-year-old lantern on a Spanish Galleon,\" he enthuses. \"And it was still lit!\" You learn something new every day. Even if it is completely untrue. WICKET! Troughton c Rashid Latif b Shoaib Akhtar 0 (147-3) Troughton is beaten for pace there. He pushes forward to one from Shoaib that leaves him and is easily held by Latif. With scores of 6 and 0 so far, Troughton hasn't found the step up from county cricket easy. 19th over: England 148-3 (Solanki 31, Flintoff 1) Fair play to Shoaib. He's going round the wicket and peppering the batsmen's ribs. They're not too keen to get behind the line. \"I think it's a bit cruel of you to tell us that Trescothick's innings \"was worth watching\",\" complains Laurence Slater. \"The whole point of your column is that, supposedly toiling away in an office, we are NOT watching.\" Fair point, Laurence. If you spelt your name properly, I might even have some sympathy for you. 20th over: England 165-3 (Solanki 31, Flintoff 13) Razzaq drops short and Flintoff pulls him meatily over midwicket for four. The next ball is a no-ball, which Flintoff helps to the fine-leg fence with an easy swivel. Two balls later, Razzaq fires a bouncer over Flintoff's attempted pull, but Latif can't reach it either: four byes. Flintoff then pulls four more with real power. If Pakistan sensed the slimmest glimmer of a chance when Troughton was out, it's all over now. \"I tell you what is odd though,\" says Simon Thomas. \"I just had a Lyons treacle tart. Do you know what is on the Lyons label? A dead lion with a load of flies buzzing around its carcass. Am I the only one who thinks this is very strange? There's also a sign pointing to Telford in the background.\" I think I need a new job. 21st over: England 174-3 (Solanki 39, Flintoff 13) Lovely shot from Solanki, who hammers Shoaib through the covers for four, then glides him through extra for four more. These two have had a great battle, but you have to say Shoaib has had the better of him: caught off a no-ball, than dropped at slip. \"Please tell Simon Jones it's not big or clever to be boasting about drinking cider,\" writes Matt Charles. That's it. England have won by seven wickets. Flintoff hastens the end with a crashing cut that bounces over the infield and away for four, and a pull for four more to tie the scores. He then helps Mahmood over extra cover for the winning biff. England have won with 28 overs to spare, having scored at 8.6 an over. What a win! Ben Mimmack is pretending to get all confused. \"I think Simon Jones should concentrate on recovering from the knee injury sustained in Australia,\" he snarls, \"rather than getting drunk on cider at lunchtime. Where's the professionalism?\" Hear, hear. Solanki finishes unbeaten on 40 from 49 balls, while Flintoff hit 26 off 13. It's 1-1, which means it all boils down to who wins at Lord's on Sunday.
