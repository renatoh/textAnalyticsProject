The Review article contained this sentence: \"We watch such developments (in this case the gradual \"deportation of an English word into French\") as we would watch the progress of a virus; like babesiosis and fog fever, such viruses afflict cattle and buffalo and wildebeest; they are the maladies of the herd.\" While the structure of this sentence is strictly accurate it has led several readers to point out that neither affliction results from a virus \u2013 babesia is a protozoan and fog fever is caused by the toxin 3-methylindole. However, like some viruses, they produce illnesses that affect herds. \u2022 An article on the experience of schools that have converted to academies said that Hardenhuish school is in Devon. It is actually in Wiltshire (Do-it-yourself conversion, 31 May, page 3, Education). \u2022 In the new exhibitions section of the Guide, Richard Billingham's series at the Guernsey Photography Festival was incorrectly named \"Let's Talk About Ray\". In fact Billingham's series about his alcoholic father is called \"Ray's a Laugh\" (Exhibitions, 28 May, page 39, The Guide). \u2022 A chiropodist quoted about his encounter with the poisonous dorsal fin of a weever fish described the experience as being \"bitten\". In fact when he accidentally trod on this fish he was stung. The advice is the same: wear flip-flops when paddling (The inside track, 31 May, page 15, G2)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
