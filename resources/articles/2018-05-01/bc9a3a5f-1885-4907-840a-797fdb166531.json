The London-Edinburgh-Inverness service will be taken back into public control on 24 June, a little over three years since Virgin Trains East Coast (Vtec) started running. It will be rebranded as the London and North Eastern Railway. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the House of Commons that after a \u201cfinely balanced\u201d assessment by civil servants, he had decided to appoint the \u201coperator of last resort\u201d \u2013 a group led by the firm Arup and under government control \u2013 to run the service, rather than allow Stagecoach and Virgin to continue under fresh terms. Grayling said: \u201cThe route continues to generate substantial returns for the government. It is not a failing railway ... However, Virgin and Stagecoach got their bids wrong.\u201d He insisted taxpayers had not lost out, adding: \u201cOnly Vtec and its parent companies have made losses at this time ... We cannot expect companies to take on unlimited liabilities otherwise they would not bid for franchises.\u201d Despite the firms now avoiding up to \u00a32bn in premium payments after the failure of the franchise, Grayling said \u201cit would not be reasonable to place conditions\u201d on Stagecoach or Virgin bidding for further rail services. He said: \u201cThey have paid a high financial and reputational price.\u201d However, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said it was \u201cabsolutely ludicrous\u201d to not place conditions on Virgin-Stagecoach\u2019s bidding passport. He accused the government of having \u201ccynically reprivatised\u201d the line on the eve of the 2015 election, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve had bailout after bailout ... Rail companies win, passengers and taxpayers lose. Franchising remains at the heart of the alleged partnerships. No amount of tinkering can solve the failings of a broken privatised system where the public takes the risk and the companies take the profit \u2013 aided and abetted by the transport secretary.\u201d The chair of the transport select committee, Lilian Greenwood, said the previous transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, had told the Commons in November 2014 that the promised \u00a33.3bn for the taxpayer was robust and had been subjected to rigorous, independent scrutiny. \u201cIf Virgin-Stagecoach got their figures wrong, so did the government,\u201d said Greenwood. She said the committee would be examining the latest failure. Greenwood asked Grayling in the Commons: \u201cWhat does this decision today mean for other franchises which we know are struggling to meet their obligations?\u201d He replied that there was no other franchise in the same position. However, industry analysts widely believe that First Group overbid for TransPennine Express, and Abellio for Greater Anglia, while a sharp drop in passenger numbers has also left First potentially exposed to losses on its South Western franchise. Labour has also questioned the future of Arriva\u2019s Northern Rail franchise, whose service was the subject of renewed attack by Manchester\u2019s mayor Andy Burnham on Wednesday. Grayling announced in November that the East Coast franchise would be terminated three years early in 2020, allowing the operators to avoid up to \u00a32bn in payments until 2023. Lower passenger numbers and revenue than forecast have seen Stagecoach losing around \u00a3200m on the franchise to date. Lord Adonis, who resigned as the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission in protest at what he called the bailout of the train firms at taxpayers\u2019 expense, said Wednesday\u2019s decision was \u201cvindication\u201d of his criticisms, and that Grayling had now done the right thing. Stagecoach\u2019s chief executive, Martin Griffiths, said the firm was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the decision. He said in the last three years, Vtec had \u201cattracted more passengers, greatly increased investment, achieved industry-leading customer satisfaction and made significant payments to the taxpayer to reinvest in public services\u201d. The collapse of the franchise marks the third time in a decade that a private train operator has failed to see out its contract on the east coast mainline, which was renationalised between 2009 and 2015. Rail unions urged Grayling to keep the line in state hands. The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThis is the second time that the government have called upon the public sector to launch a rescue operation on the east coast and instead of being a temporary arrangement Chris Grayling should listen to his staff and the public and make it permanent.\u201d Grayling said he had chosen to bring in the operator of last resort to expedite his plans to introduce a partnership model for the east coast railway from 2020, where a single team including Network Rail and a private train operator would take decisions on both track and trains on the route."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
