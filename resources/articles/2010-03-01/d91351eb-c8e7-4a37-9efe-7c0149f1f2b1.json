Heavy-legged and lacking in ideasfor the best part of an hour, Roberto Di Matteo's team summoned up a burst of energy and inspiration that culminated in Robert Koren's beautifully struck 25-yard winner, and revitalised their flagging campaign. \"We made a number of chances after the break, but we probably needed a strike like that to win the game,\" said Di Matteo, who defended his decision to start with Koren, the Slovenia captain, on the bench. \"We were a little bit nervous and edgy in the first half, but we stayed patient. The table still looks very tight, though \u2013 everybody's fighting for something.\" The chances in an appalling first half could be numbered on the fingers of one hand, and neither goalkeeper had to make a save. The best efforts came from Albion's Chris Brunt, who scissor-kicked a volley a couple of feet wide against his former club, and Wednesday's Jermaine Johnson, who robbed Marek Cech but saw his ambitious attempt to chip the Albion goalkeeper Scott Carson drift over the bar. Albion finally put Lee Grant to the test when Jonas Olsson met Graham Dorrans's cross with a downward header that the Wednesday goalkeeper reacted sharply to block. The substitute Ishmael Miller, whose introduction had given the Baggies some much-needed physical presence up front, and James Morrison, also saw headers well saved, and Dorrans a thumping 30-yard drive tipped over the bar. Just when it seemed the Owls might hang on, however, a move begun by Albion deep in their own half ended in Koren driving a diagonal shot beyond Grant. \"I felt we were coping with the pressure, but there was a moment of brilliance from a top-quality player in this division,\" said the Wednesday manager, Alan Irvine, whose side have won once in five attempts in the league. \"I'm not too concerned about being in the bottom three at this stage. If we can win five more games, we'll be fine.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
