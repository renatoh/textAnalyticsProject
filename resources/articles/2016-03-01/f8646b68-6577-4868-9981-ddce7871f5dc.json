I will be recapping each Saturday night\u2019s double bill and doing my best to keep up with the \u201cfront-running\u201d, subsidy redistributing and wiretapping of this new Danish drama about economic crime. (Would now be a good time to admit to knowing little more about economics than I did the day I opened my first account, depositing my \u00a33 in exchange for a ceramic pig in a safety-pinned nappy?) These first two episodes were a slick start to an intriguing story of offshore windfarms, dodgy dealings and slippery fish. But, I have to be honest, I\u2019m yet to be hooked. The series, created by Jeppe Gjervig Gram (co-writer of Borgen), feels a little more well-oiled than it does hearty, but let\u2019s give it time \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m yet to warm to police detective Mads (played by Thomas Bo Larsen of The Hunt fame), with his penchant for rule-breaking and tighty whities. He, at least so far, is certainly no Saga or Lund or Andri; and his relationship with fraud squad Alf is, as of yet, a bit bland: perhaps it just needs a little longer to pickle. In any case, I\u2019m more than willing to hold my breath and wait for the magic to happen \u2013 Scandi-noirs are, after all, all about the slow burn. And, to be fair to Mads, he is under a lot of pressure \u2013 his wife has MS and is just coming out of a much longer-than-usual episode, so he\u2019s had to make the kids packed lunches that they think are vile, remember their swimming lessons and take his wife her ample meds. Let\u2019s see if having his wife back and fit enough to cook the family curries calms him down. His boss, Preben, clearly hopes so: you used to be the nice guy, he says, but \u201cthis is the third or fourth time you\u2019ve become so obsessed with a case that you\u2019re about to drop the ball \u2026\u201d Does anyone else have a feeling we might be about to see a fair bit of ball-dropping? We open with an outwardly charming, inwardly rotten, green energy company CEO, Sander (played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Sarah Lund\u2019s season three sidekick and long-lost love Mathias Borch), leaving the Intercontinental hotel on Park Lane and riding, by bike \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m from Copenhagen\u201d, he says by way of explanation \u2013 along what looks like Boris\u2019s superhighway, to be interviewed on breakfast TV about how his company became a key player on the world energy market. Cut to a streaky pink Scandi sky, where the sun is rising on another day at his company, Energreen\u2019s, offshore windfarm. A body is pulled from the water and Mads is called to take a look. So begins his journey of connecting the body with unpalatable goings-on in the world of green energy. Mads, we learn early on \u2013 when he strips down to his briefs and dives in the Baltic water to fish something out, rather than waiting for the boat to arrive \u2013 is not one for patience. Used, in Alf\u2019s words, to dealing with idiot thugs, he\u2019s going to have to learn instead to chase the bottom line and (you guessed it) follow the money. But following the money can take years and Mads is in a hurry. And so he brings his bullish ways to the world of finance and spreadsheets and, it has to be said, gets some results pretty sharpish. Next up we\u2019re introduced to Claudia (played by Natalie Madue\u00f1o). A young, clever, ambitious walking Cos advert, she is a lawyer at Energreen who is no stranger to the midnight oil. She\u2019s told by slimy \u2013 \u201caren\u2019t you getting enough attention, Claudia?\u201d \u2013 boss Mogens that there\u2019s some fraudulent activity in the upper echelons of Energreen. Someone\u2019s tipping a company called East Manchester Investments off about business deals with Germany, allowing them to pre-empt trade. But it\u2019s not long before she\u2019s sussed out who\u2019s responsible, dobbed Mogens in for suspecting Sander of involvement, given Mogens a blank USB rather than one filled with incriminating evidence for him to hand to police, been promoted to head lawyer and bought a new power-suit. Quick work all round. Then there\u2019s car mechanic Nicky (played by Esben Smed Jensen) AKA Denmark\u2019s answer to Drive, who has a young baby \u2013 there\u2019s a sweet scene where he dresses up as a clown for his baby\u2019s birthday, only to be met with tears \u2013 and not enough cash to afford the flat his partner so desperately wants. She doesn\u2019t like it where they currently live \u2013 \u201cI grew up in Jutland. That\u2019s worse,\u201d he says. (Jutland looks pleasant from Google, lots of peat bogs, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s meant to represent the wrong side of the tracks.) Under pressure, he gives in to his buffoonish mate and agrees to start stealing BMWs for \u201cthe Serbs\u201d for a bit of extra cash. This is going to get him in a whopper of a pickle, have no doubt. What else do we know so far? The body floating in the water belongs to Mikhayil Husenko, a young Ukrainian who died while working on Energreen turbines in unsafe conditions. He lived with fellow workers in shoddy conditions down by the harbour, but when Mads asks around, everyone pretends not to have heard of him. His father at first gives pat answers about the circumstances of Mikhayil\u2019s death, until Mads convinces him that he won\u2019t lose his job or be thrown out of the country if he comes forward: \u201cThat won\u2019t happen. This is Denmark.\u201d Sure enough, the workers are fired en masse and Mads finds Mr Husenko hanging in his bathroom. This is not the first time Energreen has skipped on safety in a bid to maintain its position as the biggest giant on the energy scene. Once rumbled as the ones passing tips to Sebastian Kruger of East Manchester Invest, smarmy Energreen insiders Peter S\u00f8ndergaard and Mark Nyager are forced out with standard severance packages \u2013 to look official \u2013 then a cheeky \u20ac2m extra each (Sander has known about the dodgy dealings all along, authorised them in fact, but \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d). Their generous packages don\u2019t come cheap, though, and they promise to leave the country and not bring to light whatever is on the USB grotbag Peter gives to Claudia. What could it possibly be?! It remains unclear precisely what murky secrets it holds, but it certainly spooks Sander and brings his beardy henchman to question, ominously, whether he should take matters into his own hands. Having been treated like crap by S\u00f8ndergaard when he went to fix his Mustang, Nicky vows to steal his BMW for the Serbs. After an aborted earlier effort \u2013 you had one job, Bimse \u2013 he manages it. But without realising it, he has the big bucks in the boot \u2013 bound to be a poison chalice, no? Still, Bimse and Nicky are ecstatic when they find the stash, but still pretend to the Serbs to be fuming when they try and pay them less than agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re car thieves so we behave like fucking car thieves \u2026\u201d Nicky\u2019s not just a hat rack. Sander is already up to some pretty dirty tricks \u2013 while the rest of the industry, led by Hans AKA \u201cDenmark\u2019s brand is wind \u2026 we\u2019re the wind country\u201d, is petrified of the government\u2019s threats to redistribute subsidies into solar energy, he sneakily buys up a load of stock in solar, tricking others to follow suit, then selling it all in the half-hour before the government announce that the subsidies bill was not backed. As I say, I\u2019m no Keynes, but this sounds like a pretty \u2026 bad/good/illegal idea (delete as appropriate). The episode finishes with Alf and Mads hearing via the wiretap a supremely ruffled Peter calling Mark and telling him about the stolen money, car and iPad. He\u2019s after a lift over the border, stat. Thoughts and observations I quite liked Mads\u2019 wife Kristina\u2019s reaction to being told he wasn\u2019t in fact going to take any time off: \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, do you know that?\u201d So far I\u2019d tend to agree. For all of her increasingly dodgy ethics, did anyone else quite relish Claudia being able to say she was, in fact, head lawyer having been told by Peter and Mark to fetch \u201chim\u201d and bring some coffee (even if the exchange didn\u2019t end wholly rosily for her). I\u2019m suspicious that the father of Claudia\u2019s Fifa-loving son has been fired, with a generous severance packet but outlawed from working in the country for a few years. Seems too coincidental, what with all this other kerfuffle going on. Hands up who misses Andri."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
