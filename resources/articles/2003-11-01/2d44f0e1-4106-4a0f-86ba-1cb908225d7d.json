Warnock has until now refused to comment after being installed as one of the favourites to replace the sacked Peter Reid. But the Sheffield-born 54-year-old has started negotiations over a new contract, while there has been no official approach from Elland Road. Speaking on the club's official website, www.sufc.co.uk, Warnock said: \"There has been no approach from Leeds and I've not given it a thought. I've been here four years changing this club around and we have made great strides - the carrot is in sight. \"Everyone knows Sheffield United are my club and my aim is to get us into the Premiership. I'm enjoying every minute of it - I'm staying.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
