Being trapped at the foot of the Premiership is bad enough for the club that finished second behind the Tigers in the table last May. But being kicked to defeat by the man whose missed pot at goal when he wore a Quins shirt helped relegate the club here in 2005 borders on the sadistic. Jeremy Staunton's five penalties gave the champions their first victory of the season in Quins' first home match since the Bloodgate affair that saw Dean Richards resign as director of rugby last month. The game was about as pretty all those repeated shots of Tom Williams and his mouth full of tomato ketchup five months earlier with nothing as vivid as David Strettle's new pink boots. But the drama is forever off the field at The Stoop nowadays. Yesterday Richards went public in his first interview since his resignation on 8 August, 10 days before the International Rugby Board confirmed his three-year worldwide coaching ban. Richards said that he may turn his back on rugby, which is, in his view, \"not the game I signed up to 10 or 15 years ago\". He also expressed his annoyance that he was portrayed as a bully by Williams and claimed his ban was \"disproportionate\". Richards is due to face further scrutiny today, when he meets the Rugby Football Union task force which is investigating the extent of cheating in the game and the harm it has done to its image. Harlequins, desperate to put the affair behind them, will wish Richards had kept quiet, although the former director of rugby did the chief executive, Mark Evans, a favour by exonerating him from blame in the subsequent cover-up. Evans used his programme notes here to apologise to supporters. \"The reputation of Harlequins has taken a deserved battering and we will need to redouble our efforts over a long period of time to restore it,\" he said. On this evidence, though, it may be a while before Quins can also restore the sort of vibrant form that helped them to that fateful Heineken Cup quarter-final against Leinster. Nick Evans, the former All Black fly-half whose controversial return to the field against the eventual European champions sparked the controversy, could not spark the Quins back line in a match almost devoid of try-scoring opportunities. Evans did, however, create one chance after the interval. After a break by the young wing George Lowe, he hoisted a cross-kick towards David Strettle, who collided in mid-air with the Leicester No8, Jordan Crane. Quins may have had justification for claiming a penalty try, especially as Crane was shown a yellow card moments later for killing the ball. But although Evans edged Quins into a 9-6 lead with two penalties, they were unable to capitalise. Leicester brought on Julian White to batter the Londoners in the scrum and Staunton's boot did the rest. Real blood flowed and three Tigers \u2013 the captain, Geordan Murphy, Harry Ellis and Crane \u2013 left the field to have stitches. \"And they are real ones,\" joked Leicester's head coach, Richard Cockerill. Cockerill says he is not too concerned at a start in which the champions' only points in two games have come through the boot of Staunton, although they will be grateful when their leading playmakers, Sam Vesty and Toby Flood, return to inject pace in the Tigers' back line this autumn. Of more concern to Cockerill was the disappearance early in the second half of the flanker Ben Woods, their best forward, whose broken bone in his foot will be added to a lengthening injury list.
