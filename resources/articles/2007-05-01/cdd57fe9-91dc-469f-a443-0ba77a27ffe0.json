The two Tottenham fans rarely get to watch a match live, the Saturday afternoon kick-off times sitting uncomfortably with Sunday paper deadlines. So you can imagine they jumped at the chance to watch last Thursday evening's game between Spurs and Blackburn Rovers. Alas, the pair caught the wrong train from Liverpool Street station and instead of going to Tottenham's White Hart Lane ground they ended up on the fast service to Bishop's Stortford, some 30 miles away. Monkey hears they got back in time to watch the second half. \u00b7 Amid all the acclaim for BBC radio's record-busting ratings last week, the audience for one of its best-known DJs somehow slipped through the net. Double Sony-award-winning Chris Evans had an audience of 4.81 million for his Radio 2 drivetime show. Impressive stuff, but around 200,000 fewer than the 5 million who used to listen to the man he controversially replaced, Johnnie Walker, in the first three months of last year. \u00b7 Despite her pearls-and-cashmere image, Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft recently ran a nudge-nudge story about Jack Straw. This could have regrettable repercussions if two things tipped as likely last week actually occur: (a) Wheatcroft replaces Robert Thomson at the Times, and (b) Straw replaces John Reid as home secretary. Let us hope, if that scenario is realised, that Times hacks won't be treated as pariahs by the Home Office and any juicy leaks will not be automatically given to other papers. \u00b7 Monkey's quote of the week: \"I'm insecure about my looks. I think I'm ugly.\" ITV1's Grease Is The Word judge David Gest. \u00b7 The UK's most campaigning newspaper, the London Evening Standard, appears not to have written about any of its campaigns since the end of March. Not content with its \"Make our rail stations safe\" campaign, Veronica Wadley's paper has been busy crusading with its \"Seat for every commuter\" campaign, a \"real food\" campaign and let's not forget, the \"Evening Standard save our small shops\" campaign. The Standard claimed victory in its commuter campaign, even though the promised new train carriages will not be built until 2014. A campaign to clean up London's streets, barely visible under piles of free papers, including the Standard's sister freesheet, London Lite, is presumably out of the question. \u00b7 Unfortunate rumblings from the BBC's drama department, where Monkey hears head of fiction Jane Tranter is being particularly diligent by insisting on signing off every single project. No bad thing, of course, but not easy when you are also wading, sorry, reading through the scripts for the second season of Robin Hood. Monkey hears they are of similar quality to the first series. But is that a good thing? \u00b7 Living TV pulled out all the stops with its programme launch at the trendy Z Rooms in Brick Lane, east London, last week. Only problem was they were the wrong kind of stops. How does a room full of scantily clad models gyrating on boxes and bodybuilders in shorts dishing out champagne fit in with the brand image of the channel's top-rating shows such as the acclaimed Grey's Anatomy? Answers on a postcard please. \u00b7 Five newsreader John Suchet used his daily email to viewers to big up his brother David's star turn as Robert Maxwell on BBC2. \"The programme stars one of the country's leading actors . . . stop beating about the bush, John ... the best British actor of his generation, definitive in every role he plays, from Hercule Poirot to Shakespeare ... My brother, of course. Mark my words, he'll get a Bafta for this.\" But will John get a rocket from Five's bosses? \u00b7 You can catch up with Monkey every day at MediaGuardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
