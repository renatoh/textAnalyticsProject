Or, as Taylor subtly puts it: \"In our sport you find judges mark renowned nations more favourably; that is what we are up against. The Germans were third and one of their divers was a silver medallist from Atlanta. But the heartbreak of Sydney has been my driving force.\" He is not alone. Since Sydney the sport in Britain has undergone a revolution, mirroring that of swimming by bringing in a performance director from Australia, a head coach from China and a regime of discipline and hard work. Britain will take a team of seven to Athens, with Taylor and Waterfield, who compete in the 10 metre synchronised on the opening day, as the main medal prospects. But it might not have been that way. The experience of Sydney could have led Taylor, 26, to give up a sport in which he has been competing since he was eight. He had also missed out on the final of the 10m platform by one place. \"You could let it ruin your life, which is pretty much the impact it had,\" he says. \"But you can then use that, as I have, to ensure it takes you through to the next Games. I went to Sydney to win a medal in the synchro and make the final of the individual, and after it the thought of another four years seemed such a long way off, with all the blood, sweat and tears that go with it. I was so disappointed but I decided I would not let it get to me.\" Few people in Athens will have made it to the Olympics, let alone their third Games, by the route he has taken. \"My parents were sporty people but the reason I became involved was because, when I was about three, our doctor advised them it would be a way of tiring me out,\" says Taylor. \"I was quite a hyperactive child. I was never diagnosed with anything but I was full of energy and they were told that if you want some rest then wipe him out, and they were told to put me in as many sports as possible.\" He became good at them. \"In the end it tired my parents out more. I would do swimming every morning from 5.30-7.30, gymnastics on a Monday night and diving on Tuesdays. I owe my success to them.\" He swam at the national championships but, by the age of 11, diving had become his favourite sport. Six years later he met Waterfield, three years his junior, and though they make an unlikely pair they have become a successful one. Taylor is 5ft 11in, Waterfield is 5ft 6in, they live more than 200 miles from each other - the former in Sheffield, the latter in Southampton - and they will be competing in individual events as well. But when they stand side by side on a diving board they try to be as one. Investment in the sport in Britain began with the introduction of national lottery funding. Steve Foley, the former head coach of Australia, arrived just before the Commonwealth Games in 2002 to become national performance director. He had competed for Australia at three Olympic Games, finishing seventh and eighth in individual events in Los Angeles in 1984. Foley brought in China's Wen Chen as his head coach at the High Performance Centre in Sheffield. In Sydney, under Wen's guidance, Australia had won their first Olympic medal since 1924. Britain's last Olympic diving medals were bronzes for Brian Phelps and Liz Ferris 44 years ago and, though China are the dominant force, the 46-year-old Foley believes they owe much of their success to the training methods they learned from Russian coaches, the USSR having been one of the most successful nations in the 1970s. \"It has been different,\" says Taylor, who is coached by Wen. \"The knowledge that he has is far superior to many people and he tends to work you incredibly hard. Everything has been increased, from the volume of training, the hours and the level of intensity. \"I was tentative about change at first but change is sometimes a good thing and you make the best of such an opportunity.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
