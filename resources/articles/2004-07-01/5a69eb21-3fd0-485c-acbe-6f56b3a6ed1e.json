Test cricket, as they showed in a 3-0 win in the Caribbean in the spring, is what they are good at. But England's preparations for Lord's will be far from straightforward. They will agonise deep into the week about how much workload Simon Jones and Andy Flintoff, two bowlers who have just returned from injury, can bear. And then there is the state of Mark Butcher's thigh. The first England casualty from Twenty20 - cricket's contender as an extreme sport - had an exploratory jog around the outfield at The Oval yesterday and reported that he was \"running at about 40%\". Pretty much up to full speed then. Five defeats in six in the triangular tournament and a failure to reach the final caused much soul-searching in England's ranks. No conclusion was stranger than the one that proposed Butcher, nearing his 33rd birthday, as the answer to England's one-day needs. Michael Vaughan has been a chief advocate of a Butcher call-up, which just goes to show that a captain beset by a run of defeats and poor personal form will invariably try to take refuge in experience. It is cricket's version of running back to the womb, and is a sound reason for captains not to serve on selection committees. Butcher's fitness for Lord's was a central concern when England's selectors met yesterday. His Test career has flowered late and gloriously and if it has taken 69 Tests for his batting average of 35 to reach respectability, that does not remotely convey his stature over the past two years. But they were right to over look him for their one-day plans and omit him from their provisional squad of 30 for the Champions Trophy. Earlier he injured a thigh playing for Surrey against Kent and was not ready to return for MCC against the West Indians at Arundel. It was a reminder of a body that, knees especially, could easily be burned out before its time. Others have made progress. Flintoff cranked it up to the mid-80s against Yorkshire in the Twenty20 on Thursday and although hindered by an ankle spur, should be able to assume a reasonable workload. Jones emerged unscathed from the MCC match, but his fitness is a permanent source of disquiet. Twenty20 tests fitness to the limit. Duncan Fletcher, who needs little encouragement to withdraw a player from a county game, will have been disgruntled by news of Butcher's injury. There are sound reasons for England's players to star in Twenty20. If used wisely - and that means resisting overkill - its brand of instant, highly skilled entertainment can again embed the game in the nation's culture. Fletcher will be swayed more by on-field arguments. England's one-day side lack invention and variety while the Totesport League has become formulaic. Twenty20 is forcing batsmen and bowlers alike to experiment, and that is a benefit worth the risk of occasional injury. Butcher will be named in the squad, with Kent's Rob Key the likely cover at No3. Butcher had hoped to test his fitness in the Totesport League tomorrow but decided that the risk of aggravating the injury was too high. The fact it would have meant a return to Canterbury also seemed to be tempting fate. Twenty20 Cup quarter-final draw : Surrey v Worcestershire; Leicestershire v Essex; Hampshire v Lancs; Glamorgan v Warwickshire England squad (probable): Vaughan, Trescothick, Butcher, Key, Strauss, Thorpe, Flintoff, G Jones, Giles, Harmison, Hoggard, Anderson, S Jones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
