She will receive the 2007 Kohn Award in recognition of her work in raising money and visiting hospitals in an effort to ensure the NHS gives the crippling condition a higher priority. Her mother died in 1994 after a long, painful decline with the disease, when Camilla became involved with the National Osteoporosis Society. She has been its president since 2001. Claire Severgnini, the NOS chief executive, said: 'Osteoporosis blights the quality of life of older people. With 1,150 people a month dying as a result of hip fractures, the problem is both giant in scale and grim in its consequences.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
