The publication of Robert Chandler\u2019s revised translation in 2006 was a tipping point for the book\u2019s reputation in the UK. It began to receive huge praise \u2013 \u201cWorld War II\u2019s War and Peace\u201d, \u201cequal to anything in the great canon of Russian literature\u201d, \u201cit took me three weeks to read and three weeks to recover from the experience\u201d (Niall Ferguson, Gillian Slovo and Linda Grant, respectively). In 2011, an eight-hour BBC adaptation was broadcast on Radio 4. This won a new audience for the book, though the actual number of people who made it through the 850-page volume is another question. I confess I resisted Life and Fate for a long time. I\u2019m suspicious of gigantic novels and mindful of the critical tendency to overpraise them. I also recall with mixed feelings many hours spent wading through Virgin Soil Upturned by Mikhail Sholokhov, a Russian Emmerdale, and Children of the Arbat, Anatoly Rybakov\u2019s epic tetralogy about life under the Stalinist terror. These long, once-lauded Soviet novels are not without merit, but no one reads them much any more. Life and Fate has weaknesses and longueurs, but when I did read it, I found it a rewarding experience. It centres on the members and associates of a single extended Russian family, the Shaposhnikovs, whose world is torn apart by the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. The book\u2019s size is made less daunting by Grossman\u2019s short chapters, his vivid writing and his engagement with such daring topics as the parallels between Hitler and Stalin, the Soviet penal system, Russian nationalism and official antisemitism. Its furious commitment to exploring the uniqueness and humanity of a huge cast of characters is a powerful rebuttal to twin ideologies that regarded people primarily as members of races or classes. It was a brave and, as it turned out, reckless book. The manuscript was confiscated by the Soviet authorities and remained unpublished at the time of Grossman\u2019s death in 1964. The first Russian edition appeared in the west in 1980 after a copy was smuggled out of the Soviet Union. As much as I enjoyed Life and Fate, I didn\u2019t close it wishing it was longer. And yet, now comes news of a prequel. It turns out that Grossman\u2019s magnum opus is actually the follow-up to a novel called For a Just Cause. This was first published in the USSR in a number of different editions in the 1950s. The received wisdom about this book is that it was an orthodox Soviet account of the siege of Stalingrad and that it lacked the complexity and merit of Life and Fate. The very fact that it was publishable in the Soviet Union \u2013 in 1952, under Stalin, no less \u2013 is not encouraging. For this first publication in English, Robert and Elizabeth Chandler have revised the Russian editions of For a Just Cause with material from Grossman\u2019s politically riskier manuscript versions and given the book his preferred title: Stalingrad. Reading it is a very eerie experience. It\u2019s like discovering the Bayeux tapestry has a prequel, albeit with marked differences in colours and texture. The first thing it explains is the extraordinary depth of the imagined lives in Life and Fate, since we\u2019re now able to read almost 900 pages of carefully worked out backstory. The books clearly form a diptych. Characters who are drowned, wounded, in prison or concentration camps in Life and Fate, we now meet in the bloom of good health and fortune. We witness events that we previously came across only as hearsay: the Soviet retreat before the German onslaught, the evacuation of Stalingrad, the capture of key characters. Instead of the jolting opening of Life and Fate that throws us into the middle of the war, we are taken back to its beginning. The symphonic structure of the whole now becomes clear. At the start of Stalingrad, the Shaposhnikovs and their friends gather at a party. Sixteen hundred pages later, towards the end of Life and Fate, after the siege of Stalingrad has been broken, the surviving characters look back to that moment with sadness. The terrible arc of both novels is complete. As in Life and Fate, the best moments of Stalingrad are rendered with a depth and vividness that persuade you that they might have been moments from your own life: the farm worker, Vavilov, preparing to leave for war; Novikov, the tank commander, eating a lonely meal in an echoing hall on the eve of the invasion; the bloody struggle for Stalingrad\u2019s ruined factories and railway station. If the novel doesn\u2019t quite touch the unbearable heights of Life and Fate, there are heart-rending moments of loss and separation. The Chandlers have dug through Grossman\u2019s manuscripts and restored sections that fell foul of the censor. They record these emendations in an enlightening afterword. In every case, the new additions add complexity, humour and nuance. It is fascinating to observe the things the authorities objected to: little details that humanised Soviet officers were rejected for being undignified. Sherlock Holmes novels were replaced by approved Soviet writers. Most of all, Grossman\u2019s beady-eyed observations of suffering and shortages were toned down or removed. Some of the censor\u2019s demands required the addition of new material. The Jewish physicist Viktor Shtrum, who is one of the books\u2019 major characters, acquires a non-Jewish mentor. And Grossman was persuaded to insert chapters about miners and steelworkers that are frankly turgid and doctrinaire. Even with the restored passages, it would be impossible to claim this is a subversive or even historically reliable novel. It may not be a \u201cgelded fictional brontosaurus\u201d, as one detractor memorably put it, but much of it is a conventionally Soviet book. It is full of approved partinost \u2013 party spirit \u2013 and it celebrates Stakhanovite workers and resourceful commissars. \u201cThe boundless river of the Soviet people\u2019s anger and grief had not been left to drain into the sand. The will of the people, the will of the Party and state had transformed it into a river of iron and steel,\u201d writes Grossman, possibly through gritted teeth. We know now that it was not so much the abstract will of the party that was driving forward Stalingrad\u2019s defenders as the NKVD officers who were standing behind them with pistols. Antony Beevor tell us that the Soviet authorities carried out more than 13,000 executions at Stalingrad for crimes such as \u201cretreating without orders \u2026 self-inflicted wounds, desertion, crossing over to the enemy, corruption and anti-Soviet activities\u201d. Needless to say, there\u2019s none of this in the novel. Some of the biggest acts of censorship are invisible. Antisemitism, a huge aspect of Life and Fate, is dealt with only glancingly. The letter from Shtrum\u2019s mother describing the Berdichev ghetto that is one of the most powerful sections of Life and Fate is mentioned in Stalingrad. But although Shtrum reads the letter in this book, we never find out what it says. A number of Life and Fate\u2019s more interesting and problematic characters just don\u2019t appear at all. In the end, Stalingrad is a strange and complicated book. It is undoubtedly an amazing achievement of translation and scholarship. It\u2019s lucid and readable, with moments of wonderfully evocative prose. I can\u2019t imagine it will ever feel like an indispensable prelude to Life and Fate, because, as a work of art it\u2019s significantly flawed. These flaws are themselves fascinating. It is an astonishing example of the compromises between creativity and censorship. Observing the negation of Grossman\u2019s art as it tries to burst into flame in spite of the dampening of the censor, you get a deeper appreciation for the empathy, truth and magnanimity of its sequel. Perhaps the most intriguing element of all is the overstory: the way the Grossman of this novel somehow became the dissident author of Life and Fate. In the space between the two novels, the idealised bronze figures on a Soviet war memorial were transmuted into living beings. And in the process, the empathic knowledge that his work came to embody seems to have altered the heart of its creator. \u2022 Marcel Theroux\u2019s The Secret Books is published by Faber.
