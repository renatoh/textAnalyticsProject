The Sydney pop artist says the song, swirling with rich orchestration and Cerro\u2019s signature powerhouse vocals, is about \u201cattempting to push back against your oppressors\u201d. She is only 20, but says she already feels more resilient, more confident \u2013 and it shows in this dazzling, new wave-inspired pop song. Catch the former Triple J Unearthed High finalist playing dates around the country with a tour beginning on 3 October and culminating at Gorgeous festival in McLarenvale on 28 November. Let Me Imagine You \u2013 Robert Forster Robert Forster has never quite been prolific, but as the former Go-Betweens man says: \u201cSeven years is a long time between records. Seven years is a long time between anything.\u201d Demos for what was to become his new album were recorded four years ago with some of Brisbane\u2019s brightest young musicians, including Scott Bromley and Luke McDonald of the John Steel Singers. Recording was then put on hold for three years, but the product of their leisurely toil will finally see the light as Songs To Play on 18 September. As a taste of the joys to surely come, Forster has released Let Me Imagine You as a download single. His wife Karin Baumler plays violin and does backing vocals on a gentle, sublime calling card for Forster\u2019s comeback. Louvres (feat Dave Crowe) \u2013 Requiem Darwin MC Requiem has released his debut album, Louvres. The title track is, in essence, a love song to the city the former Melbournite now calls home and is named for the distinctive windows synonymous with tropical Darwin. Such a positive embrace of his new home could have been twee \u2013 and don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s snapped up by a tourism campaign \u2013 but the talented lyricist instead rolls out wry observations of a city which has clearly gotten under his skin, around relaxed beats and vocals from Alice Springs artist Dave Crowe. Requiem, aka Clayton Bennett, recently launched Louvres at Darwin festival, supporting fellow Northen Territory hip-hop act Jimblah. Despite the small audience, he gave a stadium-worthy performance. Seven Hours \u2013 Little May Sydney three-piece Little May wrote their latest single Seven Hours while staying at an isolated property perched on the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales and overlooking a dark lake. The resulting gem of a folk rock song has a thread of gentle guitar strumming like soft steps through the snow, and lead singer Hannah Field sings with a mournfulness that is moving but feather-light. The song changes pace halfway through, picking up weight with loud guitars and louder drums. Catch the group\u2019s debut album For the Company, released on 9 October as well as a national tour, kicking off with a home gig on 18 September. Make Me Love You \u2013 PVT (formerly Pivot) Ten years ago Flume had just entered high school, EDM was nothing but a rumour, and Sydney electronic rock band Pivot released their debut album, Make Me Love You. Now celebrating with a 10th anniversary edition, producer/singer Richard Pike looks back nostalgically on how he once edited audio using a second-hand beige Apple G3 in his parent\u2019s house. \u201cI was intent on marrying digital tricks with analog sounds. The album was even mixed on 24-track analog tape, which no one does these days,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had grand delusions that we were forming a new kind of tradition. Electronic and live music were very separate 10 years ago.\u201d Along with the Church and DZ Deathrays, the band will headline Small World festival on 19 September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
