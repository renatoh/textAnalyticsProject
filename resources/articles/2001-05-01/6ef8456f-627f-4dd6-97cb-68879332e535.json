But when it came to the Tokyo night, it seemed that everything had gone horribly wrong - with London's Japanese contingent ignoring the event. Tickets sales were so bad that the concert was moved from the main hall to the Barbican's small subterranean theatre, The Pit, and the running order was changed. The show may have imploded, and ended up having little to do with Tokyo let alone urban music, but in the process this became the most exhilarating, memorable night of the series. Takashi Hirayasu and Bob Brozman had originally been booked to play for free out in the foyer, but now became the headliners, and transformed the event into a showcase for the tuneful, stirring and (for western ears) highly accessible acoustic styles of the islands around Okinawa. This may be part of Japan but has a fiercely independent musical scene, and it was to here that the virtuoso American guitarist Brozman travelled to work with Hirayasu, the singer, composer and exponent of the local, snakeskin-covered, lute-like instrument, the sanshin. The resulting album, JinJin, was one of the gently charming highlights of last year, and has now been followed by a second set, Nankuru Naisa. Playing live, this pony-tailed duo sounded better still. Hirayasu's sturdy treatment of local songs and his own compositions (some dealing with the US occupation of Okinawa after the war) were embellished by some extraordinary playing from Brozman, who switched between slide guitar, Hawaiian guitar and South American charango. Initially, they could only communicate through their music but Hirayasu has now learned just enough English to show off a wicked sense of humour. An Chang Project, who opened for them, were also exceptional. A young trio from the Japanese mainland, they too specialised in updating the sturdy, tuneful songs of Okinawa, with the delicate harmony work of two exotically-clad girl singers and sanshin players backed by a subtle wash of electric guitar. As for the original Tokyo headliners, Buffalo Daughter, they gave a free, late-night show in the foyer, mixing rock, techno and funk - and sounding remarkably ordinary after all that had gone before."}, "isHosted": false}}}
