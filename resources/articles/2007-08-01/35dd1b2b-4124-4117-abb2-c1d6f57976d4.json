The pair, who have won three ATP Tour titles this year, will part ways after the US Open, which starts on August 27. The success of the duo, nicknamed Booty and Stretch, has seen them rise to No13 in the world team rankings since they linked up in February but disappointing results in recent weeks added to existing tensions in their on-court relationship. \"We had a great few months together, we won three titles, but it was one of those things,\" said Murray. \"I was ready to move on. I initiated it because I wasn't really feeling it any more and I thought it was best for me to try to find somebody else to play with. We haven't fallen out or anything like that.\" Murray's decision to end the partnership with the American now, rather than carry on until the end of the year, leaves him with the problem of finding a new partner mid-season. He is without a partner for next week's Canadian Masters in Montreal or the Cincinnati Masters the following week, though his brother Andy, who is still recovering from a wrist injury, is planning to return to competition in Montreal and might be keen to get extra match practice by playing doubles. Jamie Murray's next long-term partner is likely to be an accomplished doubles specialist rather than a singles player like his brother. The French Open champions, Daniel Nestor and Mark Knowles, are one of the teams planning to break up this year and either man would make an ideal partner for 21-year-old Murray. \"If I had the opportunity to be on the court with guys like that who have got to No1 in the world and won grand slam titles then I'd obviously love to do that,\" said the Scot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
