Not only have I never used those words or made such a claim, but more than anyone on earth I have documented (and celebrated) the opposite: that discrimination, oppression, and violence against women are in historical decline (The Better Angels of Our Nature, chapters 8 and 10; Enlightenment Now, chapter 15). I do disagree with the 1970s-era assumption that women\u2019s equality depends on their being biologically indistinguishable from men: fairness does not require sameness. Vince\u2019s observations that the distribution of women\u2019s traits overlaps with those of men\u2019s, and that individuals should be treated according to their talents and choices rather than their gender, far from contrasting with my views, could have been taken from the pages of my 2002 book The Blank Slate.
