In a speech in his Scottish constituency on Friday just before Labour starts its annual conference in Brighton, Alexander will accuse both sides in the Scottish independence debate of an \"arid, acrimonious\" argument which fails to address deep-rooted poverty and inequality. Appearing to be frustrated at the slow pace of Labour's work on alternatives to independence, Alexander will note that both the Tories and Liberal Democrats showed interest in his call this year for a \"national convention\" to investigate wide-ranging political reform after the referendum. Alexander follows up on that coded warning to Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, and senior colleagues in the Scottish party, by adding that the SNP too should get involved in any post-referendum talks. \"It would be a very tangible answer to the question 'What comes next if Scotland rejects separation in 2014?\" he is due to tell his constituents in Paisley, near Glasgow. \"The deeper question as to what kind of Scotland we want to be will not be resolved by the answer given by the referendum.\" He believes both his own pro-UK camp and its nationalist opponents are failing to take \"the real opportunity to do something radically different\" with both Scotland and the UK's political structures, economy and constitutional set-up. His remarks are the most outspoken warnings made by a senior Labour and pro-UK figure so far about Labour's strategy and stance on the referendum debate. They echo blunt attacks by Alex Bell, a former key adviser to Salmond, the first minister, on Salmond's proposals for independence in a Guardian article this week. In remarks which dominated first minister's questions at Holyrood on Thursday, Bell said Salmond was making a serious error by succumbing to \"the temptation to focus on old songs and tired policies\". Alexander, however, was struck by Bell's arguments that the economic, political and social challenges facing Scotland were global and affected the rest of the UK as deeply, going far beyond the disputes about independence. Alexander warns that with a year to go to next September's referendum there is a growing danger that the debate will become divisive and bitter, with the aggression between both sides lasting well beyond the referendum. \"In the last year alone we've seen a debate characterised all too often by shallowness, grievance and personal vitriol,\" the former UK development and international affairs secretary will say. \"There is a real risk that the vitriol, which at times has infected the debate, will not simply fade post-18 September 2014, and when people look beneath the surface of whatever numbers define the result, it will not be a pleasant view. \"Whatever the outcome of the vote, that cannot and would not be good for Scotland.\" Labour leaders have so far refused to discuss holding constitutional talks after the referendum, but Scottish party sources say privately they may sign a joint declaration with the Tories and Lib Dems about further devolution before the poll. Alexander stops short of detailed criticism of the no to independence campaign, but said the SNP were guilty of pursuing a negative campaign which blamed everyone else for Scotland's problems, and which divided neighbours and broke up established institutions. The biggest questions facing his constituents, about poverty, low wages, welfare reform and education, \"are being lost amid the aridity and acrimony of the present debate about separation.\" At Holyrood, Salmond and the Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont swapped blows over Bell's criticisms. Speaking on BBC Newsnight Scotland on Wednesday, Bell had insisted he admired Salmond. Lamont, however, goaded the first minister with extracts of his article. Lamont said Bell's resignation as Salmond's policy chief suggested there were serious tensions with the government around the first minister's independence white paper, due out in November. The first minister, she said, was becoming \"increasingly deluded and unconvincing.\" Alongside Bell's criticisms about the white paper's lack of ambition, other advisers of Salmond's, including the economists Joseph Stiglitz and John Kay, had attacked key Scottish government policies on tax and currency. \"If the first minister can't persuade those he hired to advise him of his case for independence, what chance does he have with the rest of us?\" Lamont asked. Salmond retaliated by reminding Lamont that Bell had also attacked Labour, stating that Labour should be championing the case for far-reaching economic and political reform \"if it had a spine\". Salmond continued: \"I have to say, Alex is being a bit aggressive towards the Labour party but I think basically the Scottish population would regard the Labour party \u2013 UK, Scottish \u2013 and say it's a shiver looking for a spine to run up.\" He then quoted a new poll by YouGov, showing that the wider Scottish public and even 44% of Labour voters in Scotland did not trust Lamont on independence. \"It's hardly surprising that the people putting forward a positive future for Scotland look forward optimistically to the campaign over the next year,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
