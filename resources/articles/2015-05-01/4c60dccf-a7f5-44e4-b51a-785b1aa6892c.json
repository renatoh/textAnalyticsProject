Luckily for his audience, the musician formerly known as Smog is still a master of blurring the lines between light and shade, his melancholy words and music undercut with optimism and dark humour. Tonight\u2019s show is part of Vivid, Sydney\u2019s festival of lights, so it\u2019s fitting that each song is accompanied by a projections by Illawara-based artist Paul Ryan. Ryan, a 14-time Archibald prize nominee, has provided the artwork for Callahan\u2019s last three albums, but tonight is the first time the two have met. Ryan\u2019s Australiana images of dark trees, wild rivers and imposing mountains framed by bright skies conjure a world that could just as easily be the America of Callahan\u2019s songs. On a few of the songs, the projection shows a Ryan sketch gradually come to life, layer by layer, as Callahan and his band build their song underneath. The majority of the set is taken from the four proper albums released under Callahan\u2019s own name. Over two and a half hours, he and his band play a collection of deeply textured tunes behind Callahan\u2019s distinctive deadpan baritone. Some, such as Universal Applicant, One Fine Morning and America! are drawn out past the 10-minute mark, building into a combination of delicate acoustic strumming and discordant, squalling electric guitar with heavy use of the vibrato bar. The highlight of the performance is a deadly slow cover of the Grateful Dead\u2019s Easy Wind. Over a simple, repetitive bass note, Callahan renders Robert Hunter\u2019s words exceptionally bleak, but the delivery is tinged with his customary wryness \u2013 a tone even more evident in one of just two songs from his Smog days, Dress Sexy at My Funeral. The other, a beautifully quiet version of Say Valley Maker, closes the main set and gets the biggest cheer of the night. Throughout the show, Callahan\u2019s delivery is more conversational than on record, and he seems happy to spin songs out into extended jams. On a couple of occasions this reaches the point of self-indulgence, but when the songs being played are this beautiful, it\u2019s hard to begrudge him. As the applause died down and the house lights went up, I heard fans on either side start humming different Callahan tunes from earlier in the evening. It\u2019s that sort of music \u2013 it gets ingrained in your mind, the rhythms and words etching themselves into your brain. I hope they stay there for a while."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
