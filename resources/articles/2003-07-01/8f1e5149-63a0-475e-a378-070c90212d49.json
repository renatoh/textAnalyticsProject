The Olympic bronze medallist limped out of the Madrid super grand prix on Saturday after only two laps of the 1500 metres with a calf problem, which means that at the very least her preparations for Paris next month will be compromised. Holmes's preparations for the major championships in the past three years have been badly affected by injury and illness. Despite this she battled to bronze in Sydney in 2000, finished a creditable sixth in the 800m in the world championships in 2001 and won the Commonwealth 1500m last year. That knowledge explained why she travelled home yesterday with her leg bandaged from knee to ankle but her optimism intact. \"I've been here before,\" said the former army sergeant. \"It is a case of living from day to day. \"I picked up the injury in pre-season training. It keeps coming and going and when it reared up again I made the decision to stop running. Sometimes it can be OK, but I didn't want it snapping so pulled out as a precaution and sought treatment straight away.\" In Holmes's absence Bristol's Jo Pavey took the opportunity to press her claim to the mantle of Britain's top female middle-distance runner with another superb run. She finished fourth in 4min 3.91sec and is considering abandoning her usual specialist distance of 5,000m to run the 1500m in Paris. \"I haven't run a fast 5,000m this year, while my 1500m times have come down considerably,\" said Pavey. \"Really, until I do another international 5,000m I suppose I should keep my options open.\" Great Britain's Chris Lambert, a Harvard University student, clocked a championship-record 20.34sec to finish ahead of the field in the 200m final in the European Under-23 championships in Bydgoszcz in Poland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
