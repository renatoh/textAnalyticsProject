The number of highly violent conflicts has risen to 41, from 36 in 2018, causing deaths, injuries, significant displacement and hunger, the UN\u2019s global humanitarian overview 2020 report found. More than 12,000 children were killed or maimed in conflict last year, raising fears of a \u201clost generation\u201d. Compliance with international law is declining, while attacks against aid and health workers in areas hit by conflict are putting \u201cmillions of people at risk\u201d by denying them care and aid. One in 45 of the world\u2019s population, or 168 million people, will need humanitarian assistance in 2020, the report predicts \u2013 the highest number in decades. On Tuesday, the UN Relief and Works Agency called for increased protection of aid workers in South Sudan following brutal attacks on humanitarian workers in the Maban area of the country. Last week, four health workers fighting the Ebola outbreak were killed and five injured by militia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where insecurity has hampered efforts to control the second deadliest outbreak of the virus. For the 2% of the world\u2019s population in need, 2020 would be a difficult year, said Mark Lowcock, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief, especially after a year when the number of people in need outstripped the organisation\u2019s predictions. \u201cIn 2019, many more people needed humanitarian assistance than we had forecast, largely because of conflicts and extreme climate events,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors. Yemen is expected to remain the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, with 24 million people in need, while the conflict in Syria continues to drive the refugee crisis. Humanitarian needs in DRC, Somalia and South Sudan will remain \u201cexceptionally high\u201d, with other hotspots in Sudan, the Sahel region \u2013 where displacement has increased dramatically \u2013 Afghanistan, Venezuela and Haiti. Donor funding of $28.8bn (\u00a322bn) will be needed to enable the UN and its partners to reach 109 million of the most vulnerable people with life saving assistance by 2020, said the report \u2013 slightly less than last year\u2019s requirement of $29.7bn. On current trends, \u201cunless climate change and the root of conflicts are better addressed\u201d, the UN predicts the number of people in need could rise to 200 million by 2022. Between January and the start of December, the World Health Organization estimates there have been 951 attacks on healthcare facilities and 179 deaths, in 10 countries, compared with 778 attacks and 156 deaths in 2018. The risk of aid workers being assaulted, shot or kidnapped is growing. Last year brought the highest number of attacks on aid workers on record, and the highest number of deaths since 2013. About 400 aid workers were affected by major violence, with 226 attacks, 131 people killed and 130 kidnapped. National staff were disproportionately impacted, representing 85% of victims and 94% of deaths. Despite the bleak outlook for the world\u2019s poorest, Lowcock said he was confident the humanitarian system was \u201cmore effective, better prioritised, more innovative and more inclusive than ever\u201d. As a result, the UN was asking for less money than last year. Citing examples in Africa, Lowcock said: \u201cIn Somalia, for example, early action and a major scale-up of assistance after two failed rains in 2019 meant that 1 million people initially projected to suffer acute hunger were helped out of danger. \u201cAs deadly storms hit southern Africa, early warnings and pre-positioning of aid helped us limit the number of fatalities and the severity of need. \u201cOur system is also making strides in improving coordination between humanitarian and development assistance to reduce vulnerability and risk, mitigating humanitarian need before it occurs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
