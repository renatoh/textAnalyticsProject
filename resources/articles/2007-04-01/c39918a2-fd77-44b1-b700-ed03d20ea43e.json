It was the first race of the season for the Kiwi skipper, Dean Barker. In the previous regatta Britain's Ben Ainslie had steered the New Zealand boat to be the top challenger, earning the team four bonus points, and had beaten Mascalzone Latino in the process. Barker's start was laboured and the Italian boat was able to claim the right-hand-side advantage and immediately tacked towards that side of the course while Barker and his crew continued to the left for a minute and a half. By then Flavio Favini, the Mascalzone Latino helmsman, had gained half a boat's length over the Kiwis and he extended that by a length halfway up the 2.6-mile windward leg. In the seven-knot easterly breeze the Italian boat appeared to have a slight edge in boat speed upwind and led by 29 seconds at the first mark. Barker hit back downwind and, with inspired input from the tactician, Terry Hutchinson, closed to within eight seconds at the start of the second round. But Favini and his tactician, Vasco Vascotto, pulled away once more upwind by controlling the right-hand side of the course with a fraction more breeze to be 29sec ahead again at the start of the final leg. Although Barker and Hutchinson once more closed the gap, the delighted Italians crossed the finishing line with a 15sec lead. There were easy wins for BMW Oracle against United Internet Germany and for Luna Rossa against China Team. The French Areva beat Italy's +39 and Sweden's Victory beat South Africa's Shosholoza."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
