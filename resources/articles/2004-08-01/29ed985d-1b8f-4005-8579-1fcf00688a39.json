On June 17 he gave Labour a \u00a3500,000 cheque", "bodyText": "Paul Drayson, the biotechnology entrepreneur who gave the Labour party \u00a3100,000 while successfully bidding for a lucrative government vaccine contract, also gave it another \u00a3500,000 within six weeks of being made a life peer, the Electoral Commission revealed yesterday. The latest gift was part of \u00a34.3m of donations obtained by Labour in the second April-to-June quarter of this year, comfortably ahead of the Conservatives on \u00a33.6m. The \u00a3925,000 given to the Liberal Democrats was topped by a sharp rise in funds for the UK Independence party, at \u00a31.25m, as the Kilroy-Silk factor took it towards 12 seats in the June 10 EU elections. Though big-name Tory donors such as Lord Stanley Kalms also featured in yesterday's commission report - itself part of the Labour reforms instituted after the sleaze rows of the 1990s - Lord Drayson's was the focus of comment last night. He was away on holiday, having severed executive links with his former company, Powderject, and made his maiden speech in the Lords as a champion of the kind of bioscientific enterprise Tony Blair is eager to foster in Britain. Labour insists that Lord Drayson is a wealthy man - his family shared \u00a3100m when Powderject was sold to GlaxoSmithKline -and is at liberty to make such a gift. Two inquiries have cleared ministers and the company of impropriety over the award of a \u00a332m contract to provide the Department of Health with smallpox vaccine, party officials stressed last night. But in the smoke-and-mirrors world of party donations and honours, where all the main parties have had grubby hands, there were immediate complaints from outsiders. \"The one clear message from this latest donations report is that UK political parties are in thrall to the few, not the many,\" said Dr Peter Facey, director of the New Politics Network. Trade union executives as well as wealthy individual donors also expected parties to be answerable to them, thereby undermining democratic engagement, he said. He cited the the huge impact which the Yorkshire IT millionaire, Paul Sykes, could have at UKIP for the \u00a3715,000 his company spent on UKIP campaign adverts. Liberal Democrat Chris Rennard, who was made a peer for winning byelections, also complained last night that \"no one should be able to exercise disproportionate influence as a result of large donations. In a democracy millions of pounds should not be more important than millions of votes.\" Lord Rennard called for a cap on individual donations \"to avoid the suspicion that money is buying influence or favours\". Instead Labour has imposed a system of transparency whereby donations must be declared if they exceed \u00a35,000 at national level or \u00a31,000 at constituency level. What exactly Lord Drayson may or may not have got for his donations has been a matter of dispute. The National Audit Office and the Commons science and technology committee investigated the smallpox vaccine contract and both cleared all parties. Ironically, his coup was that of a middleman, not a scientific one. He bought the UK rights to the Lister strain vaccine that the defence ministry wanted to buy from Bavarian-Nordic, the German-Danish company which makes it. In the run-up to the last election the Tories got \u00a312m in donations, double the Labour rate. This time the venture capitalist, Sir Ronald Cohen, has made a substantial donation to Labour - \u00a3250,000 - in May. The betting mogul Sir Stuart Wheeler has given the Tories \u00a325,000, as has Lord Kalms. Sir Stuart gave the Tories \u00a35m at the last election. Labour claims that it still has \"the broadest base of funding of any party\", and even rising membership levels. The party's annual accounts for 2003 show that increased income from membership subscriptions, trade unions and individual donations such as Lord Drayson's provided Labour with an operating surplus in 2003 of \u00a32.6m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
