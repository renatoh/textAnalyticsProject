Georgia, an 11-year-old dynamo with a passion for her grandma\u2019s Sri Lankan curries, has been crowned the winner of Junior MasterChef Australia 2020. She takes home the trophy, the title and $25,000. A quick reminder: she was just two years old when the last season of Junior MasterChef aired. Really makes you think about what you\u2019ve done with those nine years, right? Or at least it would if I wasn\u2019t here to purposefully distract you with dumb jokes. Georgia and the other finalists were really tested in these last few eps. In Sunday\u2019s semi-final pressure test, for example, the kids were tasked with recreating a lemon meringue coronavirus. The kids had a little over two hours to make this complex dessert from the celebrated pastry chef Kirsten Tibballs. They expressed their excitement with cute (and very 2020) phrases like \u201cI\u2019m terrified\u201d, \u201cI have never been any more stressed\u201d and \u201cthis is the face of despair\u201d. \u201cIt will be, without a shadow of a doubt, the toughest thing you have ever cooked in your lives,\u201d Mel said, reassuringly. But Georgia wasn\u2019t the only one getting baptised in the fountain of existential dread! Carter had a horror cook. He lost so much time at the beginning; he forgot to put the butter in his cake batter; and at one point he broke down in tears, gasping for air, while manically weighing some lemon juice. It was a genuinely horrifying few minutes of primetime TV and probably the closest this sweet show has ever come to The Hunger Games. The judges handled it perfectly. Jock was at Carter\u2019s side offering calm reassurance, and Mel talked up Georgia when she doubted herself; she looked the 11-year-old dead in the eye and said: \u201cYou are infinitely capable.\u201d (@fooderati I would buy a personalised Cameo to that effect.) Unfortunately for Laura and Dev \u2013 who had big flaws in their desserts \u2013 both these little legends really turned things around. Georgia\u2019s dish was the best of the lot. The rest of Carter\u2019s dish was so good the butter problem didn\u2019t even matter. Mel gave a sincere farewell to Dev: \u201cA creative, humble and inspiring gentleman.\u201d And Laura: \u201cTruly one of the most capable people I have ever met.\u201d (@fooderati, seriously, give me that Cameo.) But this is a show about pure joy, so here\u2019s a triptych of Georgia, Carter and Filo finding out they were through to the grand finale: Things were even harder on Monday night. The pressure was on, and the stage was set \u2013 literally, because Network Ten had hired an orchestra to play tense music while the kids competed. It was made more intense by the fact their mums were there! This meant the kids suffered a fair bit of backseat cooking and some light parental humiliation on national TV. The final challenge was all about being \u201cas fancy as possible\u201d: each contestant had to produce a two-course meal for four people. The dishes (a main and dessert) could be anything; they just had to have a \u201cfine dining\u201d vibe. In past seasons of MasterChef, many contestants have assumed \u201cfine dining\u201d meant \u201cFrench\u201d or, in the broadest terms, \u201crich white people food\u201d. But these sweeties are too pure for that. They\u2019re so proud of their heritage, and they know their cultures are fine as hell! Georgia made THREE Sri Lankan curries. Filo served up some fried shrimp and Egyptian spicy rice. And Carter, the token white, made a complex variation of lamb and peas. He followed it up with vanilla bean panna cotta, raspberry sorbet and chocolate soil. Filo made a hazelnut cake with mirror glaze, crumble and strawberry sorbet. And Georgia decided on a toasted coconut ice cream slice with Davidson plum meringues and pearls. \u201cIt\u2019s a blend between Sri Lankan and Australian \u2013 a bit like me!\u201d she said, exploding my ovaries. The boys did so well. The only marks down for Carter were small textural issues in a puree and the panna cotta. The only mark down for Filo was that his dessert could have used a salty element. Georgia actually had the toughest time. Though her curries were the standout in the main course, her dessert literally fell apart. The base split, the ice cream didn\u2019t set properly. She started to lose it. Her mum yelled out, \u201cYou can do it, my angel,\u201d and she replied, heartbroken, \u201cNo I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI always try to get everything right but that\u2019s not how life works,\u201d Georgia said. After a hug from her mum, she managed to get the final elements on the plate. And it\u2019s a good thing she did. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it looks like,\u201d Andy said after tasting. \u201cYour child is a genius,\u201d Mel added, essentially sealing the win. The judges said the decision came down to \u201cpure deliciousness\u201d. Georgia just couldn\u2019t be beaten. What made me feel the most inadequate See all of the above. These kids are not only talented but so sweet and strong and kind too! When I was their age, my main talent was knowing all the words to Nelly and Kelly\u2019s \u201cDilemma\u201d. It\u2019s not as impressive as cooking a fancy meal, and it\u2019s way less age appropriate. What I\u2019ll be thinking about all week My sweet boy. My lobster-loving aristocrat. It didn\u2019t work out for my man Filo but he has a bright future ahead of him. One day I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be eating at his fancy Egyptian restaurant, but until then I\u2019ll think of him every time I stand in a kitchen that is slightly too hot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
