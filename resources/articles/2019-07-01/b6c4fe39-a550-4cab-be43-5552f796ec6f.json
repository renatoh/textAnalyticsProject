Officers were called to Harrow Road in Wembley at around 8pm on Friday following reports of a shooting. Local officers and armed police attended along with London ambulance service and found a man believed to be in his mid-20s suffering from critical gunshot injuries. He was taken to a north London hospital but died a short while later. The Metropolitan police said his next of kin have been informed. A postmortem examination will be held in due course. The Met said no arrests have been made and their inquiries are continuing. Detectives from the homicide and major crime command are investigating in partnership with police in Brent. Anyone with information is asked to call police. Last month Edward Simpson, 25, died in a shooting in west London. He died at the scene in Watermill Way, Feltham. A postmortem examination gave the provisional cause of death as a gunshot wound to the upper body. Three men were arrested over the murder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
