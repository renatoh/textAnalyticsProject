Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the 2009 parliamentary defeat of Labor\u2019s emissions trading system, Conroy has lashed the political failure to develop a national energy policy as \u201cperhaps the most consequential policy failure of the modern era in Australia\u201d. While taking aim at interest groups on \u201cboth sides\u201d for the impasse over national energy policy, Conroy said the Greens\u2019 decision to side with the Liberal and National parties to defeat Labor\u2019s CPRS in the Senate in 2009 was a \u201cmassive error of political judgment\u201d with far-reaching consequences. \u201cThe Coalition and the Greens bear a heavy responsibility for the fact that, a decade later, Australia still does not have an effective policy to tackle climate change by reducing emissions,\u201d Conroy, the shadow minister assisting for climate change, will say in a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra on Monday. \u201cIt has had disastrous and long-lasting consequences for Australia\u2019s ability to respond effectively to climate change.\u201d \u201cThe costs of this failure are being born by Australian households and businesses facing higher prices, risks to the reliability of energy supplies and missed economic opportunities (and) these costs will only grow into the future.\u201d Conroy says that had the CPRS been implemented, emissions for 2020 would have been reduced to 459m tonnes compared to the 540m tonnes projected by the department, which are on track to keep rising to 563m tonnes by 2030. \u201cThat is 81m tonnes lower than now projected, or more than all of the fugitive emissions from the Australian coalmining and oil and gas production industries combined,\u201d Conroy says of the 2020 figure. \u201cThat means that by voting to defeat the CPRS, the Greens voted against cumulative additional emissions reductions of 218m tonnes between 2010 and 2020 \u2013 emissions reductions which would have come on top of the actual outcomes we have seen over the last decade in Australia. \u201cAnd by voting against the CPRS, the Greens also voted against a mechanism putting Australia\u2019s emissions on a downward trajectory beyond 2020.\u201d Conroy further argues that environmental groups should also take responsibility for Australia\u2019s climate policy impasse, saying green groups had made \u201cperfect the enemy of the good\u201d in opposing the CPRS. \u201cAs a result, Australia is still in the midst of a \u2018climate war\u2019 with no real climate policy and has higher emissions today than under a scenario in which the CPRS was implemented.\u201d Conceding that Labor had also made mistakes in its handling of the vexed issue of climate policy, Conroy said the party should have gone to a double dissolution election in 2010 after the defeat of the CPRS.

Labor is reviewing all of its policies following the election defeat, but Conroy said the party remained committed to action on climate change. \u201cIn the current parliamentary term Labor will review its policies in the light of developments in energy markets and in the wider economy, and international efforts to tackle climate change. \u201cA basic lesson from the last several years is that you can have a first-best policy solution, but unless you earn the confidence of the public you will never be in a position to implement it.\u201d But Conroy also called on the Greens and activist groups to reflect on their campaign activities, arguing that progressive forces were also to blame for the political stalemate over climate policy, along with \u201cclimate deniers, right-wing ideologues and vested interests who act as a cheer squad for delay and inaction\u201d. \u201cThe Greens are a party which seeks to increase its electoral support from progressive voters by attacking Labor on climate change,\u201d Conroy says. \u201c(And) in this year\u2019s election campaign, some environmental organisations preferred to pressure Labor to commit to closing down the coalmining industry rather than focusing on the Coalition\u2019s inadequate policies.\u201d Conroy said the anti-Adani convoy was a good example of an \u201copportunistic tactic\u201d aimed at boosting the Greens\u2019 Senate vote, but one which also helped the Coalition hang on to marginal seats in central Queensland. \u201cThe question for the Greens is whether they place a higher priority on winning votes at Labor\u2019s expense than on supporting action to reduce Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has defended the Adani convoy, accusing Labor of wanting to retreat on climate change policy because of the election result. Di Natale also defended the party\u2019s climate record, saying the party supported Julia Gillard in 2010 to introduce world leading climate legislation that reduced emissions. He said the legislation \u201cwas internationally lauded as template legislation until Labor infighting allowed the climate denialists in the Abbott government to scrap it.\u201d \u201cPrior to the last election, the Greens reached out several times to Labor in the hope of working together on climate policy but they weren\u2019t interested,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to try and work with Anthony Albanese to get a climate policy that reflects the science but we remain concerned that Labor is preparing the ground to weaken their policy at a time when we need stronger and more urgent action.\u201d On Sunday, Labor\u2019s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, said the 10 years since the CPRS defeat had reinforced her view \u201cthat we have to find common ground\u201d to act on climate change. \u201cThe thing that is quite clear is that neither the Coalition nor the Greens political party have learnt the lessons of the last decade,\u201d Wong told the ABC\u2019s Insiders. \u201cThe Coalition is still in denial, and division, and the Greens political party have to decide \u2013 are they actually prepared to look for change, to look for common ground, to act for change? Or are they really going to make it their political objective to take votes off the Labor party and have a political fight with the Labor party?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
