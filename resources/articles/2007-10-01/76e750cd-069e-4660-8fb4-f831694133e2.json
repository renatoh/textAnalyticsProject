Time was, a political leader could hope to be in post for a decade or more. Not just serial winners like Margaret Thatcher, who led the Conservatives for 15 years, or Tony Blair, who stayed at the top for 13, but even those who never made it to Downing Street: Neil Kinnock had served for nine years when he quit in 1992. The Liberals were particularly unhurried: David Steel had 12 years in charge, only one year ahead of the tally racked up by his successor, Paddy Ashdown. Now, though, our political parties burn through leaders the way teenage girls get through Top Shop clothes. Iain Duncan Smith managed just over two years; Michael Howard barely cleared 18 months. Now Ming Campbell has joined their unillustrious company, discarded by the once patient Liberal Democrats before his second anniversary in the job. Perhaps this is a function of the accelerated pace of the political cycle, what with 24-hour news and the rest; the past two weeks have certainly felt like a year of normal politics with the finger jammed on fast forward. Or it might be that the Tories' toppling of Thatcher started a regicidal habit that has spread to the other parties. Whatever the explanation, I wouldn't blame Gordon Brown for feeling edgy. Now the race is on to succeed Sir Ming, and another aspect of contemporary politics is revealed, one rarely discussed. The anointed frontrunners are Nick Clegg and Chris Huhne, with Vince Cable, the deputy leader, mentioned as an afterthought. Now, why is this? Most in the Commons regard Cable as clever and capable, yet no one seriously believes that he will be the leader. Similarly, in the 2005 Tory leadership race Malcolm Rifkind offered himself as a former foreign secretary and sharp Commons performer with more gravitas than any of his rivals, but he never stood a chance. Is it possible that in both cases, and in many others we could name, such men were never in the running simply because they didn't look right? Few would want to admit it, because it sounds so trivial, so superficial, so American, but it seems that when we describe Clegg, or before him David Cameron, as \"telegenic\", what we mean is \"OK looking\". This is not to say you now have to be Hollywood handsome to lead a British political party, but rather you have to meet a basic standard of presentability even to be in the running. This may be unavoidable in a visual age like ours, but it is hardly acknowledged. After all, what did for Campbell was not so much his age as the fact that he looked old. And now he has become the first victim of the dizzying events of the past fortnight. Brown's retreat from an autumn election relieved Lib Dems of the duty to unite behind their leader and gave them time to have someone new in place to do battle in 2009. In that sense, Brown is the author of Ming's downfall - but he could also turn out to be its principal beneficiary. It is not news that much of the Conservative revival has come at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. By showing his caring, sharing green side Cameron was able to poach wavering Lib Dems from Ming. A re-energised third party, under new management, might halt and then reverse that slide. Which explains why, whenever he was asked about Ming, David Cameron would press his palms together as if in supplication, and insist he prayed every night for the political health of Menzies Campbell. With the Lib Dems back in the fray, Brown might see the polls adjust back in his direction. But there would be a downside. Until Monday the Tories liked to joke that, come the next election, voters would have to choose between their vigorous young leader and \"two old men from Fife\". In a way, that helped Brown: Campbell provided cover for his Scottishness and made him look young by comparison. Now, if the Lib Dems choose Clegg, Brown will face two fortysomething Englishmen: his opponents will cast him as a leftover of the past, standing in the way of the future. More substantially, a new Lib Dem leader could find some weak points in the Labour armour. Promises of tougher action on climate change or an end to ID cards might pull in plenty of sullen Labour voters. All this rests, though, on a faulty assumption: that a party's fortune is entirely in the hands of its leader. The truth is, even if the Lib Dems were led by someone with the authority of Winston Churchill and the charisma of John F Kennedy, they would still be in a hole. It's a law of political geology that when the two main parties are both strong, the third party suffers. Right now, for the first time since 1992, Labour and Conservative loom like two great mountains, casting the Lib Dems between them into shadow. The SDP/Liberal Alliance flourished in the 1980s when Labour was on the floor, and the Lib Dems did well in the Blair years when the Tories were near comatose. But now that both main parties are locked in a serious, equal contest, there's all too little space left. This is true in general, but it has specific content now. The factors that repelled some voters from both Labour and Tory are now receding. With Tony Blair gone, the Iraq question has lost much of its political heat; Cameron's arrival has reduced the toxicity of the Conservative brand. Fairweather Lib Dems can now go back to one or other of their previous homes. Meanwhile, in Scotland the now governing SNP is proving itself a plausible receptacle of the dissenting vote. So the squeeze is on. How should the Lib Dems deal with it? By answering the question one Conservative strategist cruelly frames this way: what kind of party do we want to be when we grow up? For too long, there has been a benign fog where the Lib Dems' ideological clarity should be. To the left of Labour in the north, Eurosceptic in the south-west, this muddle helped the Lib Dems bag seats. But it is surely not sustainable indefinitely. There's no shortage of possibilities. One scenario would present the Lib Dems as unabashedly liberal, socially and economically: they could promise low taxes and, say, the legalisation of all drugs, following the chief constable of north Wales. Such an approach would have tremendous intellectual coherence, but there are drawbacks. It could take the party into places comfortable for a thinktank, but awkward for a political party. What's more, the rightwing postures it would entail would be too much for many activists to swallow. Alternatively, the Lib Dems could fill the vast acres of space vacated by New Labour on the left. Taxes on the super-rich, an Iraq pullout, protection of civil liberties - it could be an appealing programme. But it would hardly play well in those southern marginals where the Lib Dems do battle with the Tories. The risk is that Clegg or Huhne will be tempted simply to join Brown and Cameron in fighting for the evershrinking, hallowed terrain of the centre ground, saying nothing too daring on tax or equality or anything else (though Clegg deserves credit for proposing an amnesty for illegal immigrants). Such a huddle in the middle, leaving the rest of the ideological spectrum badly unrepresented in Westminster, would not just be uninspiring to Liberal Democrats. It would be depressing for British politics. freedland@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
