Around 150 heavily armed men raided the remote village of La Tuna on Saturday, cutting telephone connections and pillaging the home of the capo\u2019s 86-year old mother, Consuelo Loera de Guzm\u00e1n. Several vehicles were taken from the house. Two other communities were targeted in the attack, which left at least three people dead, according to the well-connected Sinaloa news organizations R\u00edodoce. The newspaper Noroeste, citing sources in the Badiraguato municipal government, which is responsible for La Tuna, reported up to 350 families had fled three communities, fearing future attacks. State governor Mario L\u00f3pez V\u00e1ldez confirmed to reporters that an armed group had entered La Tuna but said it appeared to be a family conflict, not a settling of scores by criminal organisations. He said there were no reports of shootouts or deaths due to the incursion. Although he is not thought to have lived there for years, Badiraguato was long considered the symbolic capital of El Chapo\u2019s kingdom, where he was celebrated for his criminal exploits, multiple prison escapes and role as a benefactor. Loera de Guzm\u00e1n is not thought to have been harmed, but the attack on her home suggests that Mexico\u2019s best-known kingpin may rapidly be losing influence even in a state where for years his word was law. \u201cIf this is true, then I\u2019d interpret it as a sign that El Chapo\u2019s days as king capo are over,\u201d said Malcolm Beith, author of a biography on El Chapo. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone doing this while he was active.\u201d Sources told R\u00edodoce the assailants belonged to the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Cartel, which splintered from the Sinaloa Cartel and \u2013 though weakened \u2013 is still engaged in a bitter conflict with its former allies. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that Chapo\u2019s mother was actually targeted, then it bodes terribly for security in coming months,\u201d Beith said. Long after her son rose to head one of the world\u2019s most powerful criminal syndicates, Loera continued living in La Tuna in a relatively modest home he had built for her. Her son now awaits extradition to the United States after his recapture earlier this year. He was initially returned to the same prison near Mexico City from where he had escaped but was transferred to a correctional facility in the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. A soldier guarding the Cefereso No 9 prison in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was found dead earlier this week with signs of torture. On Thursday the army deployed an additional 300 soldiers to the prison to prevent a possible third escape attempt. The Mexican government last month gave the green light to extraditing El Chapo to the United States, where he is wanted on a range of organized crime, money laundering and murder charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
