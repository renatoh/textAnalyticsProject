A marvellous 50 from Andrew Flintoff set the hosts on the way to posting a sporting total which even India's long batting line-up will do well reach at a required rate of 7.2 runs an over. Flintoff's innings was a delight and included a mid-wicket six off Kumble, and a straight drive so fierce that Sehwag, the bowler, covered his head as it whizzed by him. Flintoff's innings ended when he hoisted Agarkar high to mid-wicket where Nehra was waiting to take a calm catch. His 51 came off 38 balls, with a six and six fours. Ronnie Irani, playing a more supporting role, also chipped in with a useful half-century - his first ODI 50 which came in 53 balls. At 138 for two with 10 overs remaining and both Flintoff and Irani well set in a 76-run partnership off 67 balls, England would have hoped to have taken advantage and pushed on during the final overs. However with men in reserve, England began to take risks and the Indian bowlers began to take wickets. England suffered a similar collapse to that which condemned them to defeat against Sri Lanka at Old Trafford on Sunday and lost five wickets in only 4.3 overs, including three in as many balls. Michael Vaughan went four overs after Flintoff, also caught in the deep off a leading edge after plundering a useful 30 off 17 balls, and Irani followed in the next over when he was bowled by Kumble for 53. After that England's innings capitulated with left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra bowling Paul Collingwood and both Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart falling to Zaheer Khan in the next over. But Darren Gough finished the innings in characteristically exuberant style, hitting the last ball for six over mid-wicket, much to the delight of the packed crowd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
