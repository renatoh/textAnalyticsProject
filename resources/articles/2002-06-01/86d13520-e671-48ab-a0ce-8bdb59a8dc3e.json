When I edited Poetry Review I used to get wan little letters saying \"I can't find your magazine in your newsagents - how can I buy a copy\". If only they'd known: the terrible economics of newsstand distribution; the measly 40% take on the cover price - and that's if you sell them; the returns can be huge. So we were subscription plus upmarket bookshops, and sample pages on the web of course. On the web, distribution is no problem: it's all available 24/7, and everyone is equal, at least theoretically. There is the perfect book-buying system in Amazon, there are online poetry magazines and newsgroups. The publishers have websites so you can see what's available (bookshop poetry sections can be very patchy). Perfect in theory. How does it measure up? Google produces 7.25m pages for \"poetry\"; \"rock music\" only manages 422,000, \"food and drink\" 606,000; even \"Britney Spears\" only turns up 1.2m. So there is a lot of poetry out there. The Poetry Society site is a good place to start: it's a huge resource, maintained with great energy by the Society's Californian web wizard, Jules Mann. As well as all the Poetry Society's own activities and its online Amazon-style shop - you can join online, enter the National Poetry Competition and buy a wide range of publications - it links to all the useful sites. If you are interested in a particular poet or a poem or even a line from a poem, you can do worse that simply type it into Google: if it's there, you'll find it. It used to be hard for beginners to the poetry scene to find their way: now the web will get you up to pace remarkably quickly. The Poetry Library has a list of magazines and once you have the titles you can check out their web presence on Google. And if you're really stumped for that lost quotation the Poetry Library's Lost Poems Noticeboard now has its virtual equivalent - just type your request into the form and someone out there is almost certain to have what you need. The Poetry Society site lists forthcoming publications from the major publishers and most of them have their own site. Poetry Society links will also find you 20th-century poets with good websites devoted to them, eg Simon Armitage, Seamus Heaney, John Kinsella, Roger McGough, Sylvia Plath . A new resource coming in June is the Contemporary Writers website from Booktrust and the British Council. It will include novelists as well as poets and provide a useful profile of 250 UK writers, growing at the rate of 20 per month. Bloodaxe Books publishes more of the best contemporary English poetry than anyone else, so its website, recently rejigged and growing, offers a real taste of the best of the scene. The web is good for listings and you'll find a lot of gigs at The Poetry Kit. For London events, Poetry London is the place. The web, of course, is international, and poetry used to be very insular. But there's no reason now not to check out what's happening in other countries. The prince of online poetry magazines is Jacket, run from Australia by the poet John Tranter. It has never been a print journal. The design is beautiful, the contents awesomely voluminous, the slant international modernist and experimental. Issues of Jacket grow slowly so that you can read parts of the June issue already: it is devoted to Ern Malley - the great Australian Poetry Hoaxer - and includes the complete poems and a radio documentary in Real Audio. Good portals save you a lot of time and trouble: Web del Sol is a large US site that pools the resources of dozens of magazines. You can find classic US magazines such as Agni, Kenyon Review, Sulfur, and Prairie Schooner as well as, further out, Exquisite Corpse and Painted Bride Quarterly. Poetry Daily has its ear to the ground for contemporary American poetry. Finally, the poetry workshop is the engine room of poetry. If you don't have one near you in real time and space, Yahoo lists 1,530 poetry groups: one of them must be yours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
