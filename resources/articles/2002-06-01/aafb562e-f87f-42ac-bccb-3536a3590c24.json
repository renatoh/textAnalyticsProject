My wife and I were approached by two people who claimed to be police officers and showed us what appeared to be genuine Fuengirola police ID. After inspecting our passports they searched my wallet looking for forged currency and stolen credit cards. Then one of them ordered me to type my debit card PIN number into his mobile phone - which I did. On returning to the UK, I found that my account had been emptied. Fortunately, the bank says that I will be reimbursed, but warned that this type of scam is becoming more frequent in Spain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
