He had claimed for a second home in his Harrow East constituency in London and is expected to be asked to repay \u00a313,000 of the claim. He will also be asked to apologise to his fellow MPs immediately. The parliamentary standards commissioner, John Lyon, upheld a complaint brought in March by Greg Hands, a Tory MP, that McNulty had breached expenses rules even though he said his claims had been approved by Commons officials. It was not clear tonight whether the standards committee will go so far as to suspend him from the house. It will be the first ruling since the committee appointed a new chair, the Tory MP David Curry. McNulty claimed mortgage interest and other expenses totalling \u00a314,000 a year for the house where his parents live, saying it was his second home. The property is 11 miles from Westminster and eight miles from his main home in Hammersmith. He insisted he worked in the Harrow home at the weekends, but admitted the rules allowing him to claim were anomalous, saying no MP living within 60 miles of Westminster should be allowed to claim a second home allowance. The additional cost allowance, for second homes, is exclusively for expenses for overnight stays, and he has insisted he has stayed overnight at the Harrow home. McNulty held the seat with only a 4,740 majority in 2005 election, and will be under pressure from party whips if the committee's report is as tough as ministers expect. Peers will be told today by Lord Eames that they cannot continue to work for lobbying firms and work in the House of Lords. He has been asked to review the code of conduct for peers and tighten up the register of peers interests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
