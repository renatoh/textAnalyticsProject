Well, here's another one, and just as newsreaders seem to be sporting their Remembrance Day poppies earlier each year, so Yuletide films appear to be launched in very good time, to go with all the microwavable Christmas puddings in the shops with sell-by dates of 31 November. Robert Zemeckis has adapted and directed this version of Dickens's much-loved classic and presented it in motion-capture animation, available in 2D and 3D, lovingly intent on preserving the Christmassy brand in every rich and rosy detail. He creates digital imagery derived from live-action performers \u2013 just as in his 2004 Christmas fairytale The Polar Express and the 2007 version of Beowulf, which Zemeckis produced. The advantage is that the actors' recreated physical existences are now seamlessly part of an imagined universe and so quite as malleable. Jim Carrey plays Scrooge not merely as an old man, but as the happy young apprentice shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas Past, as the more careworn coming man of business who chooses money over love, and even as the lonely seven-year-old boy. They all look plausibly like the various ages of Jim Carrey \u2013 although, for me, the motion-capture technique always makes children's faces slightly creepy and robotic. Carrey plays all the ghosts, too, interestingly suggesting that they are projections of his own conscience. Gary Oldman provides the real-world template for both Bob Cratchit and Marley. Zemeckis's quasi-theatrical doubling and trebling is in the Dickensian spirit. The novelist would give massively popular readings, doing all the voices. In 1861, Tolstoy himself went to hear Dickens read A Christmas Carol in London \u2013 and maybe the superb description of Scrooge's horrified vision of everyone's utter indifference to his death, at a Christmas yet to come, planted a seed for the opening chapters of The Death of Ivan Ilyich. The lead performance by Carrey is workmanlike enough, with a voice that wavers between Alastair Sim and some sort of weird Celtic brogue containing a teaspoonful of Mike Myers's Fat Bastard. Colin Firth plays Scrooge's open-hearted, good-natured nephew; Robin Wright Penn is his lost love, Fan, and Bob Hoskins is the genial Fezziwig. None of the voices jar, although it beats me why Zemeckis had to hire American kids to play British tykes. It's a faithful adaptation, and if you're taking little kids to see it, well, watch out \u2013 there are some scary moments, especially the time-honoured shocker when ghostly Marley's lower jaw falls away. But there is a weird lack of passion here, almost condescension, a sense that Scrooge's agonised moral journey into his past is potentially pretty dull, and so Zemeckis is always livening things up by whooshing the old miser excitingly through the night sky between visions \u2013 a London thrill-ride perhaps influenced by the Harry Potter movies. The hi-tech sheen is impressive, but in an unexciting way. I wanted to see real human faces convey real human emotions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
