Hern\u00e1ndez has played more first-team football this season than he did in the whole of Moyes\u2019s one incomplete campaign as manager of Manchester United. In 2013-14 the striker started only six league games and two of 10 matches in the Champions League, complaining at the time that: \u201cMy club don\u2019t take me much into account.\u201d At the World Cup at the end of that season he appeared only as a substitute, with Mexico\u2019s then manager, Miguel Herrera, attributing the decision to the \u201cdifficult year\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez had endured. Now the striker, who suffered a suspected hamstring injury during Mexico\u2019s 3-3 draw with Belgium on Friday, finds himself working under Moyes again in a World Cup year. \u201cHe\u2019s a top goalscorer, a brilliant finisher,\u201d said Moyes of the 29-year-old. \u201cIt was difficult for him at United because I had Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Shinji Kagawa, so there was lots of competition. But he\u2019ll be treated the same here \u2013 if he\u2019s playing well and scoring, no problems. If he\u2019s not, it will be the same as the rest.\u201d Moyes, speaking before Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s injury, said that he would be relying on the striker and his other senior players to keep the team organised during matches. \u201cThey need to be there to say: \u2018Yeah, we know what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 Ultimately you organise them, do the work during the week, but then there is a responsibility. That\u2019s why the players are paid very good wages: they can\u2019t be looking round and saying: \u2018We want the manager to tell us what to do.\u2019 They have to have a bit of responsibility themselves.\u201d Moyes, who replaced Slaven Bilic on an initial six-month contract, said he is confident of bringing success to West Ham. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad team, a bad squad. But I can\u2019t be bothered with any drivel. I\u2019m going to be direct with the players. If they don\u2019t like it, then I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ve got to make sure we get through to them quickly. If it works, great. If it doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll see the East End of London for seven months, then I\u2019ll go elsewhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
