Twenty-one years on, with the search for environmentally friendly energy sources paramount, the prime minister has called for a new generation of nuclear power stations - a view echoed by last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Far-reaching, honest debate on the lessons of the world's worst nuclear disaster can wait no longer. The dilemma is stark. The government aims to increase electricity from renewables from 2% of output to 20% by 2020. Meanwhile, by 2023 all but one of Britain's nuclear plants, which account for 19% of electricity production, are due to be decommissioned - cancelling out most of the reduction in carbon dioxide emission that the increase in renewables would cause. Nuclear power could close this gap. But if the effects of Chernobyl are as grave as campaigners suggest, the risks involved in building new reactors, even of greatly improved design, would be unacceptable. Thousands of books and articles have explored the accident, but no consensus has emerged. According to the World Nuclear Association, a total of 54 people died of exposure to radiation by 2004. The New York Post claimed 15,000 people died in the aftermath of the explosion, their bodies secretly dumped in mass graves. Greenpeace argues that 250,000 died or will die, while the UN specialist committee on radiation has predicted that Chernobyl will be responsible for 9,000 extra deaths. These disagreements partly result from a lack of scientific consensus on the long-term effects of low levels of radiation, but other factors are also important. A very large, but ill-defined, population was potentially affected in countries where epidemiology was poorly developed. Powerful vested interests became involved: the nuclear industry and, on the other side, five million individuals in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine who, by registering as \"Victims of Chernobyl\", became eligible for pensions and other benefits. The issues are complicated. A rise in recorded birth defects since 1986 in parts of Belarus affected by the accident has been taken to prove that Chernobyl radiation has had widespread genetic effects. But a similar pattern occurred in areas not significantly affected, suggesting that the rise may be a consequence of heightened awareness. Research must continue. The lives of those directly involved will continue to unfold over the next six or seven decades. But global warming will not wait. The time has surely come to attempt an authoritative assessment of the lessons of Chernobyl. The government should enlist a body such as the Royal Society to lead a searching inquiry. This should be grounded in the best science. It should be impartial and separate from the nuclear industry. It should address the whole range of public concerns. It should be led by specialists able to explain complex data and to help the public in comparing risks. It should assess how far it really is feasible to eliminate the possibility of a catastrophic accident in future reactors. The Swiss vote for the nuclear option in a 2003 referendum shows that, faced by global warming, approval is possible. But if science fails to lay the ghosts of Chernobyl and informed consent is not forthcoming, the government must abandon its plans to build nuclear reactors and seek other ways to reconcile the public's desire for rising living standards with a sustainable future. \u00b7 Patrick Gray is a director of Oxford Policy Research and led a UN inquiry into the consequences of the Chernobyl accident.
