In a grandstand finish, Marcus Smith came off the bench to inspire Harlequins to a stunning late comeback, completed by James Chisholm\u2019s last-gasp try, but for Wasps it was a dreadful way to let victory slip away. In a thrilling end to the match, Haskell was sent off with four minutes to go for a swinging arm on Jamie Roberts. He made contact with the head, meaning the entry point for any suspension would be six weeks and while that would most likely be reduced for mitigating factors, England begin their Six Nations campaign in Italy, three weeks on Sunday. It would be a bitter blow for Haskell, who was not involved in England\u2019s autumn campaign but was recalled into camp by Eddie Jones earlier this month. \u201cIf it\u2019s a shoulder to the face or head he will get banned,\u201d said Wasps\u2019s director of rugby Dai Young. \u201cUnfortunately, he might get a couple of weeks, but hopefully it\u2019s not too long. James is really disappointed. He stood up and apologised to the player straight away.\u201d When Haskell departed the field, Wasps were still clinging on to their lead at 28-26 and on target for a bonus point victory. By that stage however, Smith had come on to play his part in two Harlequins tries to bring his side to within touching distance. Smith, 18, signed a bumper first professional contract last week and this cameo was just another example of why. Compounding England\u2019s woes however, Smith came on for Mike Brown, who was taken to hospital after reporting blurred vision. \u201cMarcus coming on at 10, he was lively and sparked us,\u201d said the Harlequins director of rugby, John Kingston. \u201cThe win gives the group more belief. I\u2019ve been telling them every week if we can ride the injury storm and give ourselves half a chance we can really start to hit our straps.\u201d Wasps can still mathematically qualify for the last eight but they are third in Pool One and as Young conceded: \u201cMiracles don\u2019t tend to happen too much in Coventry\u201d. It is a killer blow for Young\u2019s side, who led 21-0 after half an hour and by 16 points with 15 minutes to go. Indeed, three tries \u2013 all converted by Danny Cipriani \u2013 gave them a commanding lead with Harlequins reeling from the loss of Charlie Walker to injury after just five minutes. It was a scrappy start but Wasps sprang to life when Lewis Boyce, in at loosehead for Harlequins in place of the suspended Joe Marler, was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on. Just two minutes later, Wasps had their first try after a sharp handling from Cipriani, Willie le Roux and Thomas Young put Kyle Eastmond clear. With Boyce still in the sin-bin, Nizaam Carr then scored a superb solo try, running in from all of 50 metres after more quick hands from Wasps. Carr has a considerable turn of speed but the ease with which he shrugged off Brown\u2019s tackle typified Harlequins\u2019 listless start. And when Ashley Johnson finished off number three from the back of a driving lineout, Harlequins were staring down the barrel. The hosts\u2019 fightback began when James Lang, the 22-year-old making his Champions Cup debut, evaded two tackles and kicked into space for Ross Chisholm to collect and roll over the try-line. Lang then stepped his way over from close range to take Quins in at the break nine points behind. When Brendan Macken powered past Roberts after taking a well-timed pass from Cipriani, it gave Wasps the bonus point they had targeted but the visitors could not see out the victory they so badly needed. With 15 minutes to go, Danny Care sniped over from close range after a concerted period of Harlequins pressure and Smith\u2019s conversion brought the side to within nine. Smith\u2019s long, floated pass to Elia Elia put the replacement hooker away in the corner. He nailed the tricky conversion from the left-hand touchline for good measure before Haskell\u2019s moment of madness and James Chisholm\u2019s killer blow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
