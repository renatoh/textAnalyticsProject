At least that's the billing, but Online's trials this week have seen the performance fall some way short of expectations. The device is simple to use, with a joystick and four buttons as controls. The screen is bright and clear, and it certainly is light. But the key feature - the quality of the sound - is a disappointment. Walking around central London it was near impossible to get a steady signal - vital, given that in the digital radio world, something either works or it doesn't. It sounded great while hooked up to the hi-fi at home: but that's hardly the point with such an ultra-portable device. On this evidence, anyone looking to buy a digital portable radio should try before buying - even if you think you're in an area with a strong digital signal.
