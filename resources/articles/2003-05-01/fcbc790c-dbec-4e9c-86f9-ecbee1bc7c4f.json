A few steps away, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was admitting he knew nothing of Southampton's plans to play a testimonial against Aberdeen a couple of days after the FA Cup final, but England will have a hard time admonishing James Beattie and Wayne Bridge for risking their fitness when David Beckham and his side have just flown to the southern hemisphere to take part in the biggest testimonial ever. And lost their captain into the bargain, although Beckham, lucky boy, always knew his season would end this week. The rest of the England team now exist in a sort of limbo, or La Manga as the travel agents call it. After England had failed to agree with Turkey and other opponents on a mutually acceptable set of qualifying dates, England's home fixture against Slovakia was pulled out of a hat, with the mutually unsatisfactory result that it takes place on 11 June, a full month after the end of the league season. Apart from morning training sessions in La Manga, to be followed by afternoons at leisure with wives and girlfriends, the only event England have to look forward to before the Slovakians arrive is a friendly on 3 June against Serbia-Montenegro at Leicester. That is about as unexotic a fixture as you will see on the international calendar, and it will be interesting to see who turns up to watch it. Owen, showing diplomatic skills of his own after taking over from Beckham as captain, admitted the whole South Africa jaunt was mostly a PR exercise for the 2010 World Cup bid. 'It was more about the South Africans than ourselves,' he said. Coupled with the fact that Eriksson went back on his word and made seven substitutions in the second half, it was tempting to write the whole thing off as another meaningless friendly, except that the sizeable number of England fans in Durban enjoyed themselves immensely. Here was an England game in a fairly far-flung destination, watched by a significant number of travelling fans who made their presence felt, but did not cause trouble. The game might not have amounted to much from a neutral or aesthetic point of view, but the South Africans were mightily proud to be staging it and the English were just as pleased to be there. It was, if you like, an affirmation of what is wholesome about watching England, and a much needed one after the unpleasant atmosphere at Sunderland. Craig Brown said he thought the security was over the top, and coming from a Radio 5 Live pundit so guarded in his opinions he makes Trevor Brooking sound like Alf Garnett, this conjured up visions of triple barriers and three policemen to every England fan, but at the game it was not so. Nor did it need to be. The Durban constabulary were more in evidence during the day time, cruising along the beachfront to make sure nothing got out of hand in the bars, but the sound of sirens was conspicuous by its absence. Let us hope the same applies at Leicester. There are two reasons to worry that it might not be. The first is the city's large Asian population who, if they have any sense, will not want to go anywhere near the sort of England supporter encountered at Sunderland. If those lovable neo-Nazis are looking for another England game at which to make their racist feelings felt, they have the perfect opportunity. The other worry is that not very many of the England supporters from Durban will turn up. Not because they cannot afford to go to every game, although many are on tight financial schedules, but because they don't want to. 'I can't understand anyone wanting to watch an England friendly at home,' a supporter who confessed to spending the best part of \u00a32,000 on his South Africa trip told me at the airport. 'I don't see where the fun is in that. They are just meaningless, aren't they?'
