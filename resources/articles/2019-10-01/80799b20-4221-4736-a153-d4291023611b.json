Matip suffered a kick to the knee in the win at Sheffield United on 28 September and returned to the side against Manchester United following a three-week recovery period. The central defender felt the injury again at Old Trafford, however, and Liverpool plan to ease his return to full fitness. The 28-year-old, who recently signed a five-year contract at Liverpool, will miss Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie with Arsenal, Saturday\u2019s Premier League visit to Aston Villa, the Champions League return with Genk and Manchester City\u2019s trip to Anfield should he remain sidelined until after the international break. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has favoured Dejan Lovren over Joe Gomez in Liverpool\u2019s last three matches without Matip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
