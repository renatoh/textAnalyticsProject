Now he'll be trying to out-shout Bill O'Reilly. Twice Kucinich, an eight-term Democratic congressman from Ohio, subjected himself to the degradations of presidential politics. But his appetite for punishment appears to be undiminished. Fox News has announced that Kucinich, who lost his congressional seat in primary elections last year after his district was redrawn, will join the network as a regular paid commentator, starting on Thursday night. It appears that it will be his job to supply the liberal perspective for on-air debate on the pressing issue of the day. Did Hillary Clinton fake a blood clot to avoid testifying about Benghazi? Should teachers be required to carry Uzis? Is Barack Obama more socialist or fascist? \"Through 16 years in Congress and two presidential campaigns, Fox News has always provided me with an opportunity to share my perspective with its enormous viewership,\" Kucinich said in a statement. \"I look forward to a continuation of our relationship this time as a Fox News contributor.\" The Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, said he had always been impressed by Kucinich's fearlessness and thoughtfulness on the issues, according to the Associated Press. The network has hired commentators from the left in the past, including Alan Colmes, a former comedian who was paid to be shouted down nightly by Sean Hannity on Hannity and Colmes. Kucinich, who became mayor of Cleveland at 31, won national popularity on the left for his broadsides against the Iraq war and the Bush administration. Despite the uncompromising nature of his political views, he was a popular figure on Capitol Hill whose friendly smile survived every debate, no matter how scathing. His sunny demeanor should serve him well in showbusiness. Kucinich also won a measure of infamy for anecdotes from his personal life that bubbled into public view, including the story of an extended encounter he had with aliens, which was recorded by a close friend, the actress Shirley MacLaine, in a memoir: The smell of roses drew him out to my balcony where, when he looked up, he saw a gigantic triangular craft, silent, and observing him. It hovered, soundless, for 10 minutes or so, and sped away with a speed he couldn't comprehend. He said he felt a connection in his heart and heard directions in his mind. In a later interview with Tim Russert, Kucinich acknowledged that he had seen a UFO."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
