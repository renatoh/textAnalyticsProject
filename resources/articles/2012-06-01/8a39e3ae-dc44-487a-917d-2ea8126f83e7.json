But who is in the field bar the obvious internal candidates who have not, the Diary gathers, overwhelmed the chair of the BBC Trust Lord Patten? Among the outsiders who still loom large in the chair's mind are said to be Financial Times editor Lionel Barber, Channel 4 creative supremo Jay Hunt, the omnipresent Ofcom chief Ed Richards. And one surprise \u2013 John Berry, artistic director of the English National Opera. The Radio 3 candidate. Quiet please. \u2022 So many questions to be asked, meanwhile, about the brand new, eye-watering Barclays interest-rate-fixing scandal and, public servant that it is, the BBC is asking them. And there are people ideally placed to help in that spirit of inquiry. Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays, would be a useful source, and he just might be willing to help out, wearing his other hat as the first non-executive director appointment to the BBC's new executive board in 2006. As my colleague Roy Greenslade flags up, he is also its senior independent director. A stroke of luck having him around, one might think. \u2022 Boris Johnson, mayor of London, is just as lucky, for he too has someone able to guide him around the intricacies. He could call Bob Diamond, the Barclays chief executive and the man the mayor very publicly appointed to sit on his charitable Mayor's Fund for London despite protestations from Labour that he was cuddling close to a fat-cat. Diamond could give him the real story. \u2022 On the eve of the close of nominations for the leader of the Green party, bad news. For it has emerged that the membership system is in meltdown. For well over a year the party has been assured that the new membership system will shortly give an accurate figure for their followers. The party's executive only a few months ago were predicting a potential membership of 16,000, with leader Caroline Lucas issuing statements to this effect. When Lucas was elected in 2010 there were about 10,000 members. This and the election of a Green council last year in Brighton were predicted to increase membership dramatically. Sadly, the best estimate is now 8,500 [see footnote]. And some members who had paid their subs received notification from the party office that their fees had lapsed. Chaos all around. Oh dear, what's eating the Greens? \u2022 Deep into Sherwood Forest went the Olympic torch yesterday. Its journey continues to delight and irritate supporters and critics up and down the country. Some people fall into both camps. Among them is John McBride, who wanted to run his stretch of the relay in Durham barefooted. He has completed the Great North Run for the past four years, always doing the last mile barefoot in solidarity with children of the Korogocho slum in Nairobi, Kenya. McBride supports a project to help the children of Korogocho with shoes and sports facilities run by British aid agency Cafod. You can't run barefoot, officials said. John was adamant. \"They can flog the torches carried by celebrities for thousands of pounds. But the idea that an ordinary bloke like me might take his shoes off was strictly against the rules,\" he says. \"I refused to put my trainers back on and defied them to remove me from the relay. They let me run.\" He then took his torch to Nairobi and gave it to the children. If that's not the Olympic spirit, what is? \u2022 Finally, the great man of letters Martin Amis grants an audience to ShortList magazine on the occasion of the publication of his novel Lionel Asbo. The mag wonders if he has any thoughts on Prince Harry, as the young man grows into his role as third-in-line to the throne. This is what follows. \"Amis fiddles with the reading glasses dangling around his neck and pauses as if trying to remember something very important. 'He's ginge, he's loud, he's done us f*cking proud,' he recites, raising his voice like a North Stand regular at a football match. 'He's here, he's mean, his gran's the f*cking Queen.'\" Thereafter, the interview progresses as expected. twitter: @hugh_muir \u2022 This footnote was added on 3 July 2012. The Green party puts its current membership at more than 13,000 \u2013 up from 12,798 in December 2010 and 9,630 the previous year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
