Then, a couple of years ago I had one of those \"now or never\" moments and I joined a paragliding club called Green Dragons, down in Croydon. It's one of my best decisions. Paragliding's a very low-tech way to get in the air. You lay a nylon canopy out on the floor behind you, then, as you run down the hill, the canopy comes up in the air like a parachute and lifts you off the ground. It's an amazing feeling. You're very much at the mercy of the weather, so perseverance is the key. You have to learn to judge the wind. Because I'm still quite inexperienced, my normal flight's around five minutes - although on a good day I have managed to stay airborne for over an hour. I think a lot of the appeal is the contrast with my job. I've worked in IT for about 25 years - currently with IBM - and it's a great job, but it's also very sedentary and cerebral. Paragliding is the total opposite in that it's entirely reactive. It's also physically demanding because the gear itself weighs 20kg. I've had some amazing experiences in the air. Last year I went to Lanzarote with the club and I reached the base of the clouds at 3,000ft. Recently, I found myself sharing air space with a buzzard and kestrel. I took part in my first competition about six weeks ago. I didn't do brilliantly, but it was great fun. Peter Haslehurst was talking to Maia Adams.
