Abdul Goni, a 35-year-old Indonesian, was found guilty of helping to plan the attack - in which 202 people were killed - and of illegal weapons possession. He is the fourth person to be jailed for life for a role in the bombings, which tore through the Indonesian holiday resort. The conviction came as survivors of the attacks, and families of the 28 British victims, met Foreign Office officials in London to voice concerns over what they have described as the \"chaotic\" government response to the attacks. Sentencing Goni at a court in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, trial judge Made Sudia said: \"The defendant has been proven guilty and we sentence him to life. \"The acts committed by the defendant and his friends have resulted in the deaths of 202 people from 16 countries, worsened the economic situation in Bali and damaged its public facilities.\" Goni was silent during the proceedings, but his lawyers said that they would launch an appeal against the verdict. The defendant had faced a possible death sentence, but was given life imprisonment because he had not been directly involved in carrying out the attack and had been well-behaved during the trial, the judge said. The panel of judges said that Goni had inserted chemicals into filing cabinets housing the bomb that devastated the Sari Club, a large nightclub at the heart of the Kuta beach area, which is popular with western holidaymakers. Another bomb went off by Paddy's Irish bar nearby. Goni is the 31st defendant to be convicted in the case. Three men have been sentenced to death, while other sentences have ranged from three years to life imprisonment. The Bali blasts - the deadliest terror attack since the September 11 2001 attacks on the US - catapulted Indonesia into the frontline of the international war on terror, and severely hit Bali's tourism-dependent economy. In London today, members of the UK Bali bombings victims group sharply criticised the British government's response to the attacks. The group also insisted that official procedures for dealing with large terror attacks around the world still needed substantial improvement. In a statement issued ahead of a meeting with the foreign affairs spokeswoman, Baroness Crawley, the group said: \"There is no doubt that the chaotic and insufficient FCO response in the early weeks after the Bali bombings greatly added to the distress of those UK citizens who had been injured or bereaved. \"Many questions still remain to be answered by the British government over the Bali bombings - not least the serious misjudgement in the intelligence assessment of the terrorist threat in Bali before the bombings, and the handling of the injured survivors. \"We greatly look forward to the FCO briefing today, and hope very much that it will lead to better treatment of British nationals in the future if they find themselves in similar circumstances.\" A Foreign Office spokesman insisted that changes had been made in the wake of the blasts, and added: \"We hope to provide them with some more insight into the lessons we have learned from Bali and how we aim to improve our services in the future.\" The Indonesian authorities have blamed the al-Qaida-linked militant network Jemaah Islamiah for the Bali attack, as well as the bombing last August of the Marriott hotel in Jakarta, in which 12 people were killed. However, despite their success in bringing convictions against many of those responsible, police are still hunting key suspects, including Malaysian fugitive Azahari, the alleged master bombmaker. Last week, the policeman who led the Bali blast investigation told reporters the island was still a soft target. Authorities had been monitoring the flow of legal chemical substances that could be used in making Bali-type bombs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
