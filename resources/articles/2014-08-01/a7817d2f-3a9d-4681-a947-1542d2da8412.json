Simon was referring to the 85-yarder sent forth by the on-loan goalkeeper \u2013 who is on Hull\u2019s books \u2013 against Livingston just 11 days after arriving at Easter Road. It was all the more impressive given that he had not seemed that bothered about taking the kick on in the first place, and all the more gratifying that he launched into unfettered celebration without any po-faced embarrassment on opposite number Darren Jamieson\u2019s behalf. \u201cI\u2019d take a clean-sheet every time,\u201d said Oxley. \u201cThat tells you more about a goalie than the odd goal once in a blue moon.\u201d It\u2019s in Scotland we stay thanks to David Forbes and Fraser Leith, whose great minds both channelled the name of a certain Marc de Clerck into our cranium. We\u2019ll let David take up the story: \u201cI immediately recalled Aberdeen\u2019s Belgian goalie Marc de Clerck who scored on his debut for the Dons in a League Cup tie at Berwick Rangers in 1980. His was the third in a 4-0 second-leg victory, the first leg having finished 8-1 in Aberdeen\u2019s favour. Signed from Twente Enschede, we had a Belgian keeper signed by a Scottish club from a Dutch one scoring on his debut in England. Beat that!\u201d But all good things come to an end. Having completed such a Herculean endeavour, De Clerck signed for \u2026 actually, carry on please David: \u201cDue to the emergence of Jim Leighton, Mark made only two senior appearances, and kept two clean sheets, for the club before moving back to SC Heracles in the Netherlands. Oh for a striker these days who could average a goal every other game.\u201d They did it even bigger and better across the pond, mind. \u201cWhat about the first ever goal scored by a goalkeeper in Major League Soccer?\u201d asks Dan from Metrofanatic.com. \u201cDanny Cepero did it in 2008.\u201d So he did, and the other striking thing in that clip \u2013 quite apart from the hallucinogenic pitch \u2013 is the commentator\u2019s dawning disbelief that debutant Cepero might actually be credited with the goal he had scored. On the topic of artificial stimulation, the context that Dan proceeds to outline is quite something: \u201cCepero was drafted by Red Bull New York in 2007, but did not play a minute that season. In 2008, he looked very unlikely to play, as starter Jon Conway played every minute of the first 28 matches. But with just two games left in the regular season, Conway became the first player in MLS history to get suspended for performance-enhancing drugs. Cepero, who was in the process of finishing his university degree, got the unlikely call. He scored to cement the 3-1 win against Columbus. He then improbably backstopped lowest-seeded New York into their first MLS Cup, where they lost \u2026 3-1 to Columbus. Cepero would play only one more season in MLS, and was out of soccer by 2011.\u201d We have rustled up a couple of recent efforts ourselves. Also in the USA, West Brom and Boaz Myhill were on the receiving end during a friendly back in July 2011 when San Jose Earthquakes goalkeeper David Bingham bounced one past him from his own box. Competitive game it wasn\u2019t, but Bingham\u2019s first-ever game for a professional team it certainly was. And in October 2012, Port Vale\u2019s Sam Johnson \u2013 then just 19 \u2013 was pressed into action for the first time in a Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy tie against Walsall. It went to penalties and, after repelling opposite number Karl Darlow\u2019s effort, Johnson slammed in the winner. It was the 22nd penalty of the shoot-out, and the first he had ever taken. NORWICH CITY: MANAGING THE FUTURE? \u201cThe 1997-98 Norwich side contained three players that would go on to become managers of the club (Peter Grant, Bryan Gunn and Neil Adams),\u201d noted Ben Kippin last week. \u201cIs this some kind of record?\u201d No, writes David Hopkins, who in fact is a little more polite than that. \u201cCan I nominate the 1970-71 Derby County squad, which featured three future Rams managers in Dave Mackay, Roy McFarland and Colin Todd (Mackay being comfortably the most successful, what with a league title and 4-1 victory over Real Madrid on his CV)?\u201d he offers. \u201cAnother of that squad, Alan Durban, was assistant manager under McFarland, although never sat in the hot seat himself.\u201d Chelsea are accused of stockpiling players in this day and age, but what about future bosses? Damon Maddison says that four of their squads from the past can match this record. Deep breath: 1996-97 (Ruud Gullit, Gianluca Vialli, Roberto Di Matteo); 1973-74 (John Hollins, David Webb, Ray Wilkins \u2013 although the latter was a caretaker); 1969-70 (Eddie McCreadie, John Hollins, David Webb); 1965-66 (Eddie McCreadie, Ken Shellito and John Hollins). There is more from James Tennant. \u201cThe record of three is currently equalled by Milan\u2019s team of 2002 with Leonardo, Seedorf and current incumbent Pippo Inzaghi all having played in the team together and there is scope for them to be joined by Alessandro Costacurta, who was \u2018technical assistant\u2019 in 2007-08.\u201d We\u2019ve created a monster here. Ben Holmes observes that \u201cEverton in the late sixties featured Royle, Kendall and Harvey who all managed the club and all in FA Cup finals no less\u201d. One more to match Norwich\u2019s par and then the point is surely well made. \u201cThe great Paris Saint-Germain side of 1994-1995 achieved the same feat with Ricardo Gomes from 1996 to 1998, Paul Le Guen from 2007 to 2009, who was replaced by his former team-mate Antoine Kombouar\u00e9 from 2009 to 2011,\u201d explains Baptiste Fillion. But wait. Three is not the magic number. Phil Kayes can trump all that with Leeds\u2019 early 1970s side, reminding us that Allan Clarke, Eddie Gray, Billy Bremner and Norman Hunter were in the hot seat \u201call in the space of eight (mostly miserable) years\u201d. The two best, though, are saved for last. Sean DeLoughry points us to a veritable school of learning in 1980s Ireland. \u201cShamrock Rovers\u2019 1983-84 squad \u2013 the first season of the club\u2019s famous four-in-a-row league titles under Jim McLaughlin \u2013 contained five future Rovers managers in Dermot Keely, Noel King, Pat Byrne, Liam Buckley and future joint-caretaker-manager Terry Eviston,\u201d chirps Sean and, even if Eviston\u2019s claim feels more borderline than most, we like it. But the winner here comes from Turkey. Birol Cabukusta emails with the revelation that Ismail Kartal, who moved from assistant to head coach with champions Fenerbahce last week, is the fifth member of their 1988-89 squad to take the helm. He follows Ridvan Dilmen, Turhan Sofuoglu, Oguz Cetin and Aykut Kocaman in having the pleasure and, given that they all contributed to a club-record 103 goals that season, there\u2019s hope of a few more fireworks in Istanbul this time around. SUCCEEDING WHERE ANOTHER FAILED After a pitch invader at West Ham ran the length of the pitch to pop up behind Spurs midfielder Christian Eriksen and clip a technically-decent effort into Adri\u00e1n\u2019s arms \u2013 a sight closer than Eriksen\u2019s subsequent, legitimate effort it must be said \u2013 we posed a question of our own: has a pitch invader ever gone one better and actually scored? Now, we\u2019ve looked into streakers finding the net, but what we\u2019re after here is the element of surprise from clothed invaders. Ours needs to have caught the professionals unawares to some extent, either nipping in during open play or, as on Saturday, interrupting a meticulously-planned set piece. We need the defensive wall to be braced tightly, crown jewels clasped, just as West Ham\u2019s was. Dribbling slowly towards a gaping goal, pursued by burly policemen, while the game has been stopped in your honour and 22 players laugh or roll their eyes does not count. There is a pretty obvious place to start and it\u2019s in Russia. You could probably cut the tension with a knife on 19 September, 2009, as Spartak Moscow\u2019s Alex prepared to take a penalty that would level things up against FK Saturn Ramenskoe. The home goalkeeper\u2019s starjumps could not put off an unwanted guest, though, whose left-footer was right out of the \u201cstraight down the middle\u201d manual. Alex, for what it\u2019s worth, took due inspiration and scored. This scamp, who chose the same approach but saw Tim Howard stand his ground in Everton\u2019s friendly against Juventus last year, had less joy. Pitch invaders, you really have to mix things up. Give them the \u201ceyes\u201d next time. There is no video for this one, but the tale of a Montenegrin pitch invader who stepped up and put his free-kick up, over and around the wall late on in a match between Buducnost Podgorica and Lovcen gained some traction back in June 2012. He celebrated with a knee slide \u2013 and saw the referee blow up for full-time straightaway. Remember when Dion Dublin surprised Shay Given? These Barnsley fans had clearly been watching, hijacking Ben Foster\u2019s late goal-kick in 2009. It\u2019s an efficient job: the slide, the look up and the presence of mind to smuggle the ball across for the tap-in. The best of them all actually counted. S\u00e3o Paulo-based side Santacruzense were a goal down in their home game against Atl\u00e9tico Sorocaba when their ballboy took things into his own hands. It was given, and it\u2019s still hard to conceive the sequence of events that the referee must have thought had happened in order to allow the goal. We\u2019ll finish, though, with this favourite from last year, also from Brazil. It\u2019s not even a goal \u2013 it\u2019s a team masseur saving one \u2013 but it goes to show that, when used correctly, interlopers on the field of play can be decisive at both ends of the pitch. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cFollowing Phil Jagielka\u2019s transfer to Everton, some light-hearted comments were made that due to his proficiency in goal he could put pressure on Tim Howard for the No1 shirt at Goodison,\u201d asked James Frankland back in July 2007. \u201cThis got me thinking: has a team ever signed an outfield player and then converted them into a goalkeeper?\u201d Obviously, James, there are plenty of goalkeepers who began their careers in the outfield, most notably Chelsea\u2019s Petr Cech (\u201cI started as a winger or in midfield,\u201d he told the Independent on Sunday. \u201cWhen I was eight we played a friendly game and our goalkeeper didn\u2019t come. But when I was 10 I broke my leg, so finally I stayed in goal\u201d). However, the former Inverness Caledonian Thistle keeper Jim Calder began his career as a striker and didn\u2019t move between the sticks until a knee ligament injury befell him at the age of 26. \u201cI always fancied myself as a keeper,\u201d he recalled. You always find keepers fancy themselves as strikers and want to play out in training, but I was the opposite. I was an outfield player who liked playing in goals. I did it when I was a youngster, but I was always a better asset to school teams and the cub scouts as a forward. I definitely wish I\u2019d started in goals sooner. If I\u2019d stuck in maybe I\u2019d have gone a bit further because as I have got older I have got better and better, moving up a league standard-wise.\u201d Reader Joe Stynes also notified us of the former Leeds, Aston Villa and Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland player (dual representation was allowed up until 1950), Con Martin. According to Wikipedia, \u201cMartin, nicknamed Mr Versatility, played in nearly every position during his career. Although he played mainly as a centre-half, the ball-handling skills he developed playing Gaelic football also made him a very useful goalkeeper. It was as a goalkeeper that he made his debut for the FAI XI and despite turning down the chance to sign for Manchester United as a goalkeeper, he later played a whole season in goal for Aston Villa.\u201d His first international match was also as a goalkeeper \u2013 and he kept a clean sheet as Ireland beat Spain 1-0 in Madrid. He played the rest of his international career outfield, memorably scoring a penalty in Ireland\u2019s 2-0 victory over England at Goodison Park in 1949, the first time England were beaten at home by a non-UK team. While away days, weeks, months by thumbing through the Knowledge archive. CAN YOU HELP? \u201cLast week\u2019s London derby in the Capital One Cup saw Brentford draw 6-6 with Dagenham &amp; Redbridge before going on to win 4-2 on penalties,\u201d notes Matt Kelcher. \u201cThis meant that unusually there were six more goals (or twice as many) in the match than the shoot-out. Is this the biggest differential between in-game goals and shoot-out goals in history?\u201d \u201cAmidst the fun and games during Hearts\u2019 pre-season friendly with Dinamo Bucharest, the Romanian team snuck on a sub to replace a sent-off player. Has any team put on an extra player in a competitive game? And did they get away with it?\u201d queries Joe Stroud. \u201cInspired in part by Bristol City\u2019s grape away shirt, for which they\u2019ll surely never need a third kit: has any team ever had a first kit so distinctive that they never wore their away kit?\u201d That\u2019s from John O\u2019Brien. \u201cAfter Nottingham Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi decided sponsor the club so that he could have Fawaz written on the club shirt, I wondered whether this is the first example of an owner putting their name on the shirt like this? There\u2019s something rather marvellous about that level of showing off,\u201d marvels Jon Salt. \u201cMy team Southampton have gone diacritic crazy in this transfer window bringing in what I think are an accent grave \u2013 Graziano Pell\u00e8, a diaeresis \u2013 Saphir Ta\u00efder, a cedilla \u2013 Florin Gardo, and the twofer of a caron and an accent acute \u2013 Du\u0161an Tadi (not to mention the already-there Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez). I was wondering has any other UK team\u2019s club shop been forced to put in so many special orders at the people who make the letters to put on shirts in such a short space of time?\u201d asks M\u00eck\u00e9 R\u00f8g\u00ebr\u0161. \u201cIf only second-half goals counted, who would be the all time Premier League top scorer?\u201d tweets Chris Donoghue.
