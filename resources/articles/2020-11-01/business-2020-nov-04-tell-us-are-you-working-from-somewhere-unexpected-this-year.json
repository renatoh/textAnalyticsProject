Perhaps you used to go into the office, and now you not only have to work from home, but from your child\u2019s bedroom? Or perhaps you\u2019ve used the opportunity to work from somewhere completely different such as a boat, or even on the beach? Maybe you prefer your new, unexpected set-up and have found you get more done, or perhaps you can\u2019t wait to return to your usual routine? Either way, if you\u2019ve found yourself working from somewhere unexpected this year, we\u2019d love to hear about it \u2013 and see a photo too, if possible.
