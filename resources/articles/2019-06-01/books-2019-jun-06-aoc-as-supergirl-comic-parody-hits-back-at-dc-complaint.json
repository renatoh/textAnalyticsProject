Devil\u2019s Due said that it had been issued with a cease and desist letter from DC in May after it published a limited edition of its comic Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force, showing her in an outfit like Wonder Woman\u2019s, holding the American flag. According to Devil\u2019s Due, DC said the cover \u201cviolates their Wonder Woman copyright\u201d. Comics news site Bleeding Cool reported that the letter requested the edition, which only ran to 250 copies, should \u201cnot be distributed, but recalled and returned or destroyed\u201d. Now Devil\u2019s Due has released a replacement cover that it is calling the Cease and DCist edition. This time, AOC is depicted in an outfit that references the DC character Supergirl, Senator Bernie Sanders resembles the Green Lantern, and congresswoman Ilhan Omar echoes Batman. \u201cA parody of a parody! Yet still somehow less of a parody than Washington!\u201d says the cover. \u201cDon\u2019t be MAD. This isn\u2019t about any actual DC superheroes.\u201d Devil\u2019s Due added that \u201calthough Wonder Woman and her attire make no appearance in the Cease &amp; DCist Edition \u2026 it cannot confirm or deny whether her invisible jet is on the new cover\u201d. Devil\u2019s Due publisher Josh Blaylock said: \u201cThe irony is, the cease and desist was already a moot point by the time we received it. Regardless of it being unwarranted, as a retailer exclusive, the extremely limited amount of copies were already out of our hands. I\u2019m assuming anyone who bought one is now awaiting trial in a Hall of Justice holding cell. Thoughts and prayers.\u201d Just 500 copies of the latest variant cover are being published, with a portion of proceeds going to immigrant legal services provider RaicesTexas.org. Ocasio-Cortez previously told TMZ it was \u201cincredibly humbling\u201d to have been the subject of the comic book, and that she was especially honoured that proceeds would be given to RaicesTexas. \u201cI\u2019m just a normal person doing her best,\u201d she said, expressing the hope that her character might inspire \u201ca little girl somewhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
