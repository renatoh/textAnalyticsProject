Muhammad's crimes were \"so vile that they were almost beyond comprehension\", said the circuit judge LeRoy Millette, who turned down a plea from defence lawyers to spare their client's life and instead fixed October 14 as the date for his execution. That date likely will be postponed to allow appeals. Muhammad, 43, was convicted of capital murder on November 17 last year and a jury recommended he be sentenced to death for the murder of Dean Harold Meyers at a gas station. Muhammad denied any involvement in the killings today. \"Don't make a fool of the constitution of the United States of America. Just like I said at the beginning, I had nothing to do with this, and I'll say again, I had nothing to do with this,\" he told the judge. Defence lawyers had filed a motion yesterday arguing that life imprisonment was the more appropriate sentence to eliminate the disparity between Muhammad's punishment and that of his 18-year-old partner in the killings, Lee Boyd Malvo. Malvo, who will be formally sentenced tomorrow in Chesapeake, Virginia, was given a life term by the jury in his trial. Circuit judges in Virginia can only accept or reduce the jury's sentence, but not increase it. Earlier today, Judge Millette rejected a defence request for a new trial for Muhammad, whose lawyers based their motion on letters that Malvo wrote to another inmate in jail. The defence had been unaware of the letters - which proved Malvo acted and thought independently and was not under Muhammad's influence - before the trial, they said. The prosecution, however, claimed the letters added nothing to the case, and the judge agreed. Muhammad's lawyers have raised several issues that are likely to be primary points of appeal. First, they argue that under Virginia law only the triggerman in a shooting death can be eligible for the death penalty. The six-week trial never conclusively determined who pulled the trigger in the killings, and much of the evidence suggests Malvo was the shooter. But the judge found for the prosecution, which argued that the triggerman issue was irrelevant, and that Virginia law allows a death penalty in cases where a defendant can be shown to be \"the instigator and moving spirit\" of a killing. The defence team also argues that a second capital conviction based on a new antiterrorism law is both unconstitutional and improperly applied to Muhammad. The Virginia legislature passed the law - which defines terrorism as a crime committed with \"the intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence the policy, conduct or activities of the government ... through intimidation or coercion\" - after the September 11 2001 attacks. The prosecution argued that the circumstances of the October 2002 sniper spree fitted the definition of terrorism on the basis that Muhammad and Malvo had demanded a $10m (\u00a35.4m) payment from the government to stop the shootings and left notes at shooting scenes promising \"more body bags\" if their demands were not met."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
