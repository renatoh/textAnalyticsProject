On premises that once belonged to British Gas Sir Bobby Robson turned up the heat. He told his squad that, if this game against Everton was lost, Newcastle could bid a sheepish farewell to Champions League football next season. \"I said to the players: 'Drop three points and we'll not finish fourth,'\" Robson explained. To the extent that Newcastle won, Robson's gas worked, though Shay Given admitted the victory \"wasn't convincing\" and expressed concern that the two goals he conceded could have a decisive impact, so close are Newcastle and Liverpool on goal difference. Given also acknowledged that Everton's Steve Watson had a legitimate 68th-minute goal disallowed, which would have made the score 3-2 and turned Joseph Yobo's 81st-minute header into an equaliser. So there were sub-clauses to Newcastle's satisfaction. But overall, Given's tenor, and Robson's, was one of pleasant relief. \"Won 4-2, back to fourth, great,\" was Robson's summary. He was right for 24 hours, until Liverpool won yesterday. Impressively, this was Newcastle's eighth consecutive victory at St James' Park, six of them in the Premiership. But Arsenal are here next, on Sunday, and Chelsea arrive a fortnight later. Newcastle's other remaining home game is against Wolves, and presumably it is one of the four matches Robson thinks Newcastle must win if fourth place is to be theirs. \"I'd like it if we could win four of seven,\" Robson mused. \"I think we'd take that; the programme is tough.\" Robson did not give the impression that Arsenal or Chelsea will be beaten on Tyneside, which means Newcastle may have to find three wins from their four fixtures on the road. Those are at Aston Villa and Manchester City and then, in the space of four days in the last week of the season, at Southampton and Liverpool. Newcastle have won away only twice this season and last week's 1-0 defeat at Bolton worried everyone at the club. \"Very, very poor,\" said Given of Newcastle's away record. \"We lacked energy and zip at Bolton,\" Robson reflected. Tiredness from a long trip home from Real Mallorca in the Uefa Cup was blamed. Yet on Thursday night, after Newcastle have faced PSV in Eindhoven in the next round, the team will take a 90-minute bus trip to Brussels to fly home. Any advantage Newcastle thought they might gain from Arsenal having to play Liverpool on Friday will surely be reduced by their travel arrangements, though clearly Arsenal could do them a big favour against Liverpool. The other team from Merseyside did them a few here. Yobo may have scored his first Everton goal but he and David Unsworth made Newcastle's first three, too. Both Everton centre-halves were culpable on Newcastle's fifth-minute opener. Alan Shearer outjumped Yobo and then Unsworth was muscled off the ball by Craig Bellamy. Unsworth has a backside worthy of Amberleigh House but Bellamy, who has revealed that his airport spat with coach John Carver began over a car parking space, accelerated around it to score. But Thomas Gravesen organised Everton's reply and scored a quick equaliser. Kevin Campbell then went close and Yobo struck the crossbar a minute after half-time. In between, however, Kieron Dyer was handed his first league goal for 14 months and Shearer then pounced on a Yobo mistake to make it 3-1. Shearer made it 4-2 in the last seconds for his 26th goal of the season. \"He did what he had to do,\" said David Moyes of Shearer. Can Newcastle follow his example?
