This intriguing new series, presented by Angus Macqueen, argues persuasively that our Canute-like efforts to make drugs illegal are more harmful still. In this first episode he sets out his stall. Britain, he notes, spent \u00a31.5bn fighting the drug trade last year, and yet drugs \u2013 as he learns from on-the-ground reportage \u2013 are so commonplace as to be mundane. So, what we're doing isn't working. But what would? AM On Hannibal's Trail 8.30pm, BBC4 Intrepid brothers Danny (fetching green shirt), Ben (natty blue shirt) and Sam (striking red shirt) have pedalled furiously through Barcelona and crossed the Pyrenees into France, following in the cycle paths of that famaous Carthaginian cyclist Hannibal who, 2,200 years ago, brought Rome to its knees with a rusty chain and a sharpened bicycle pump. Tonight, the boys head for the Alps, to re-enact Hannibal's crossing of the river Rhone. Fun, inspiring and educational, like a history lesson from your mates down the pub. AJC Britain's Park Story 9pm, BBC4 Here's yet another reminder that we didn't need an Eton-educated Tory to (re)invent the idea of the \"big society\". Why? Because it's all around us, part of the fabric of our day-to-day lives. Take our public parks. Or rather, leave them where they are, if you please, because, as Dan Cruickshank explores in a documentary for the Call of the Wild season, they're great. Sure, some of the history of Britain's public parks may be tied up with top-down Victorian thinking \u2013 green places, that'll keep the poor out of the alehouses \u2013 but even starch-collared busybodies have good ideas sometimes. JW Rev 10pm, BBC2 Tom Hollander's display as put-upon east London vicar Adam Smallbone has been, punning aside, a revelation. The show itself has been good enough to make comparisons with The Vicar of Dibley look more than foolhardy, so let's hope that a second series is forthcoming. This final episode sees Adam suffer a crisis of confidence and faith after reading a scathing review of one of his sermons on a church social network \u2013 the struggle to work out what he's doing with his life that follows is, like Rev as a whole, poignant and funny. WD The Boss Is Coming To Dinner 6pm, Five Another loosely-stitched Frankenstein's monster consisting of bits from old C4 formats: Come Dine With Me While Interviewing Me For a Job. Eight candidates pointlessly cook dinner for their potential employer over the course of four nights. Eliminations occur throughout the week with the big final on Friday. Tonight, Julie, the manager of a top Brighton beauty salon (Katie Price goes there, you know), auditions/interviews/digests-the-puddings-of her first two contenders. If you're going to be doing Jordan's extensions, you'd better be able to make a shallow tart look semi-appetising. Eh? Eh? JNR Chuck 9pm, Virgin 1 The big Chuck news at the moment is the forthcoming addition to the cast by Linda Hamilton, playing Chuck's mum. But Terminator fans get another treat this week with an appearance from T2's Robert Patrick as a super-shady Secret Ops high-up who sends Casey on a \"mission within a mission\". Chuck catches Casey in the act, then gets a threatening text message from him to keep his mouth shut. Which he doesn't. Which is bad news for everyone. Meanwhile, Morgan, who now knows Chuck is a secret agent, tries to get in on the act, showing spying isn't really something just anyone can do.
