Sheila Oakes, the mayor of Heanor, had the whip withdrawn by the Amber Valley Labour group after making the comments in response to a Facebook post about the news. While she is no longer a Labour councillor, she can sit as an independent politician. Underneath a post asking people to say a \u201clittle prayer\u201d for Boris Johnson on Monday night, Oakes wrote: \u201cSorry, he completely deserves this and he is one of the worst PMs we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d On Tuesday, shetold the BBC she was sorry \u201cfor upsetting people and saying it\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t think what I said would upset so many people. It came across as not a nice thing to say,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about nurses and doctors who don\u2019t have protective equipment. I said something when I was angry without thinking about the prime minister or his family.\u201d The leader of Amber Valley Labour group, Chris Emmas-Williams, told the broadcaster there would be an investigation into Oakes\u2019 conduct. \u201cThis behaviour is totally unacceptable and not what the Labour party are about,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not made the comments, but I feel as leader of the Labour group I have to apologise as well to Boris Johnson and his family, and we wish him well because we need everyone possible to fight this disease.\u201d Johnson was admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London on Sunday with \u201cpersistent symptoms\u201d of Covid-19, 10 days after testing positive for the virus. He was moved to intensive care at 7pm on Monday after his symptoms worsened. According to Downing Street, he is being given oxygen but is not on a ventilator."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
