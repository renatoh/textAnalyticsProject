Opening for the government in the House of Lords debate on the prevention of terrorism bill, Lord Falconer urged the house to consider the \"threat of mass casualties in this country and overseas\". \"First the threat is made worse by the willingness of those engaging in terrorism to cause cataclysmic events such as 9/11; second, the well-funded nature of the terrorism; and third, the fact that people are prepared to die in the course of exercising these terrorist atrocities,\" he said. The lord chancellor's claim that the government would consider all representations made to it was, however, viewed sceptically by peers, who had heard the home secretary, Charles Clarke, rule out further concessions on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning. Mr Clarke told the programme he had \"no desire\" to backtrack further than his announcement yesterday that judges, rather than ministers, should make control orders subjecting suspected terrorists to house arrest. Speaking for the Tories in the upper house, Baroness Anelay dismissed Mr Clarke's bill, saying he had \"settled on the wrong answers - ones that sacrifice essential and long-standing principles of liberty and justice in a way that is unlikely to materially enhance the security of our people\". That view was echoed by the Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Thomas, who said security was \"no justification for the breach of fundamental principle which underpins our democratic system; no deprivation of liberty by ministerial say-so\". Despite his U-turn, Mr Clarke was attacked from all sides in the Commons yesterday by MPs angry that his concession did not go far enough. While conceding that judges, rather than ministers, should make control orders, Mr Clarke resisted calls for judges to also be responsible for making less severe orders covering restrictions of movement or the use of computers or mobile phones. That failed to impress many MPs - particularly as the home secretary had declined to table his amendments in the Commons, preferring to wait until the bill reached the Lords - and 60 Labour backbenchers backed a rebel amendment calling for judges to approve all control orders. The amendment, proposed by the Labour backbencher Win Griffiths, was defeated by only 267 votes to 253, the government's smallest Commons majority since last year's vote on university top-up fees. Following such a close call, ministers were relieved when the bill secured its Commons third reading by 272 votes to 219. They found little comfort, however, in the Lords, where Labour peers are in a minority and are rarely as obedient as their Commons counterparts. Lord Strathclyde, the Tory leader in the Lords, this morning made his intentions clear when he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government \"should prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill\". He added: \"They should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial, and I think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest.\" Meanwhile, Mr Clarke told the programme he had \"no desire\" to drop his plans for house arrest or reconsider the use of intercepted evidence, such as recorded telephone conversations, in court, setting the scene for parliamentary deadlock. The home secretary's tough stance waqs this morning backed by Downing Street, with Tony Blair's official spokesman telling reporters: \"The government is not going into the House of Lords planning to make further moves, because we believe we have got the balance right.\" Mr Clarke said: \"No bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made, but I believe that what I announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the House of Lords. I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill.\" Meanwhile, Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of anti-terrorist laws, this morning suggested that the government must be ready to introduce more legislation following if it was re-elected at the general election. \"That [legislation] should include allowing intercept evidence to be used in court,\" he told Today. \"I believe very strongly that that might be useful in a small number of cases,\" e said. \"I also think the government should look very carefully at changing terrorism law so that a new offence is introduced of acts connected with or preparatory to terrorism which could be tried in the normal criminal way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
