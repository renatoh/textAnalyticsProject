High-heeling it in Madonna's footsteps, Gillian Anderson knocks on the head the idea that charisma amounts to performance. Stunning, stunned and blonde doesn't mean riveting. No star can rescue a dim play and a torpid production. What the Night Is For is a play which could and should send people screaming from the theatre. The advertising that enticed people towards Michael Weller's play by suggesting an internet dating element was largely misleading. This is a story which barely bumps into the twenty-first century, physically or emotionally. A man and woman, both married, who had an affair a decade earlier when they snogged their way through a reading group, meet by arrangement in a hotel. He's traced her through the net (that's the modern bit) and has his eye set on long-term adultery; she has other plans. They spend the night gawkily wondering what they're going to do. The play is a long dither interrupted by clich\u00e9s: the television blares into rowdy life just as the couple are about to Do It. Finally, their behaviour becomes so dottily pointless that Weller dumps a (hitherto unsuspected) manic depressive disorder on his heroine, a condition that Gillian Anderson announces by bouncing up and down in her pyjamas. You don't believe - not for a minute - that these two have ever sparked each other, or anyone else off. Why do these supposed lovers keep reminding each other of what they're called - 'Melinda?' 'Adam?' - as if they were taking part in an establishing scene in The Archers ? How can she be supposed to be an expert on developmental speech pat terns when her language is so null? Why does Anderson, waving around a few statuesque hand gestures, struggle to be chicly sardonic, when it's hard to know what there is to be sardonic about? Here's the dramatic equivalent of necrotising fasciitis, the disease in which the body attacks itself. Bits of dialogue rise up to accuse the play. Within minutes, someone's announced: 'I think I need a clearer idea of what's going on.' Shortly afterwards, someone's complaining that there's 'no urgency' in their relationship. Tim Hatley's design strands the couple in a huge purple box, which drains every bit of colour from the exchanges and swamps any possibility of intimacy. There are times when people should promptly leave the auditorium and ask for their money back. This is one of them. Luckily, there's dramatic life outside the West End. David Farr's incisive production of Coriolanus urges his audience to rethink Shakespeare's Roman plays, in fact, to consider them as Japanese. The Roman code of honour is replaced by that of the Samurai: togas and scrolls are out; in are gongs and kimonos, a shivering percussion and a blood-red floor. It looks gorgeous, moves freely and is propelled by an illuminating idea: that the twenty-first-century West regards traditional Japan much as Shakespeare's contemporaries regarded Ancient Rome: as a combination of decorum and ferocity. And once you've got over the anachronisms (forums, curly hair), the best performances fit effortlessly into the scheme. As Volumnia, Alison Fiske cherishes her son's wounds; Richard Cordery oozes genial manipulation. And as Coriolanus, Greg Hicks is magnificent. Sarky and balletic in sash and wide, swishing trousers, he makes his disdain into something double-edged, almost admirable. He's like a professor of fastidiousness: each word is topped and tailed with clicking consonants; each gesture is carved from his motionless body: the slightest rearrangement of his shoulders looks like a giant act of resolve. Even looking down his nose can seem like too much effort. The only argument against Farr's conception is that it overlooks the clearest link and most interesting argument between the sixteenth and twenty-first centuries. What are those Romans really doing? They are behaving exactly like the upper class in England, buttressed by their majestic matriarchs, in their belief that their sons should be blooded. This is a production which bodes well for Bristol Old Vic, where Farr is soon to take up the joint artistic directorship. Another new artistic directorship is taking promising shape in West Yorkshire. Ian Brown's second show there, compiled and performed by Tom Courtenay, sews together poems and prose by Philip Larkin to make a portrait of the poet. Pretending to be Me (which is what Larkin said he'd be doing if he ever became a poet in residence) steals victory against the odds. For a start, there's the essentially untheatrical nature of Larkin and his work: the poet of the melancholy murmur has to be turned into a creature of dramatic utterance. Then there's Courtenay. His sadsack demeanour may chime with Larkin's lugubriousness, but there's a fundamental difference: Courtenay wants to be liked. When he turns his face - elfin, round-eyed, not at all the high-domed, long-cheeked poet's - to the audience, he does so with a look of appeal. His cadence is wistful rather than gloomy. And his selection skirts the worst of Larkin's bile. When he does say something foul, he becomes extra-winsome. All of which might neuter the occasion. It doesn't. Larkin's observations - shrewd, unpredictable and funny - make the evening dance. On the deplorable lack of porn on his newly acquired television. On Ted ('Incredible Hulk') Hughes: 'He looks like a Christmas present from Easter Island.' On gardening: 'Anything that looks bright and positive I take to be a weed.' And Courtenay, who holds an audience without ever seeming to command, does something extraordinary. Watching him, you'd hardly know where the chat ends and the poem begins. Listening to him, there's no doubt, as the lines and sense tighten into verse. The lucidity and emotion are continuous. There's no break between the everyday and the expressive, the artistic. There's no difficulty in understanding this. Which was Larkin's big anti-modernist point. And here that point is taken. Wonderfully well.
