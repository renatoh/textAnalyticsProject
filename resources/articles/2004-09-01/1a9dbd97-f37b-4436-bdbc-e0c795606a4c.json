Part of the Fence collective - along with Lone Pigeon - of Fife-based singer-songwriters better schooled in punk rock and electronica than the homely ways of Ralph McTell, there's nothing winsome about Yorkston. He's closer to Robert Mitchum; his songs are full of hard loving, big drinking and brutality, though his voice barely rises above a cosy whisper. Yorkston is no fey storyteller - he's a furious chronicler of home truths. But he's frustrated. A problem with his guitar has a technician scurrying around his feet, while Yorkston gently strums a delicate rhythm, quietly singing about a girl called Nicky who used to beat him black and blue. His demeanour is cheery, his words bruised. \"It's a true story,\" he says, stopping suddenly. \"A sad story.\" Yorkston's got a lot of them. His first album, Moving Up Country, was critically acclaimed for its rugged introspection and varied instrumentation. His latest album, Just Beyond The River, features a more organic, naked sound courtesy of fellow folk innovator, Kieran Hebden of Four Tet. Not for nothing are his band called the Athletes: they deftly wrap Yorkston's Celtic lyricism and rootsy honesty in layers of accordion and double bass, keeping a tight reign on the easy melodies. Wallowing in the damaged optimism of Heron, he grins as his guitar notes grow harsher, before wheezing into his harmonica for the brisk Americana of Moving up Country, Roaring the Gospel. A genial host, he bursts into a chorus of Take My Breath Away and dedicates The Surf Song to - \"anyone who has ever taken off all their clothes and dived into the sea\". But that technical hitch means time is against him. After a burst of banjo he's off, taking half an un-played set-list with him. \u00b7 James Yorkston and The Athletes play Barfly, York (01904 466149) on 30 September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
