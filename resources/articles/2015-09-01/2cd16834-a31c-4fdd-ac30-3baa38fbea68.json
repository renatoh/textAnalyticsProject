As Walcott said himself, the team are not at their best and yet this was a third consecutive clean sheet and a performance defined by the creation of a glut of scoring chances. Were it not for the latest excellent performance from Jack Butland in the Stoke City goal, the visitors would have been humiliated. Arsenal might have been three or four up inside the opening 10 minutes and, at the end, Butland could reflect on having made a fistful of breathtaking saves. The statistics showed that Arsenal had 29 efforts on goal and it is stating the obvious to say that the lack of ruthless edge will be punished by better teams at home and in Europe. Walcott, however, could see plenty of reasons for the glass being half full. Defensively, Arsenal barely gave Stoke a sniff and he and his team-mates would rather have the chances to miss than be labouring for openings. The ball will surely begin to go in for them, particularly Alexis S\u00e1nchez, who hit the post twice and remains goalless for the season. \u201cWhen people say we\u2019re not playing great \u2013 we are starting to get to where we want to be,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cAnd when we do hit that, people will be more and more worried. It\u2019s the sign of a good team if you\u2019re steady going but still getting the results. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting three points at this moment in time. No one is going to remember the start of the season. It\u2019s all about how we finish. People may not have seen the best of us yet but we are keeping clean sheets and creating a lot of chances. We\u2019re especially pleased with the clean sheet. We look very solid and we\u2019re not letting many chances against us.\u201d As Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had done in Arsenal\u2019s previous fixture \u2013 the 1-0 win at Newcastle United \u2013 he started with Walcott rather than Olivier Giroud and the manager said that, given the club\u2019s situation, he now considered Walcott more as a central striker. The situation to which he referred takes in Danny Welbeck\u2019s long-term knee injury and the failure to sign a new striker over the summer. \u201cI like Theo as a centre-forward,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI don\u2019t say he will never play as a winger any more but, considering our situation with him and Giroud, in the coming months you could say he will be more through the middle.\u201d There was plenty to like about Walcott\u2019s performance against Stoke: the way his pace stretched their defence, the spaces he found in the final third and the strength and composure he showed for his goal, which followed Francis Coquelin\u2019s tackle and Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s ball over the top. It was his 11th goal in 11 Premier League starts but he blotted his copybook with a number of misses, including two horrible ones in the early running. \u201cYou become an instinctive finisher once you have a bag of goals behind you and Theo needs a few more goals to do that a little bit more spontaneously,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cBut he has an eye for goal and a short backlift and that is the common thing for top scorers.\u201d Giroud replaced Walcott on 75 minutes and also scored but missed two crystal-clear chances. Unusually, Wenger does not seem to be settled on his first-choice striker and it will be interesting to see if he affords Walcott a run in the starting XI. Arsenal\u2019s next game is their Champions League group-stage opener in Croatia at Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday, then they go to Chelsea on Saturday. Stoke remain without a win, they are rooted to the foot of the table and their lone positive was Butland, although that, in itself, was something of a double-edged sword. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give him the opportunity to be man of the match for us on too many occasions but he certainly was here,\u201d Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, said. \u201cHe has great maturity and the calmness he exudes helps him.\u201d Man of the match Santi Cazorla (Arsenal)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
