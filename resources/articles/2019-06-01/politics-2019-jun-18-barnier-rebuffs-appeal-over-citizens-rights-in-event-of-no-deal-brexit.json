In a clear signal from Brussels that it is not willing to countenance a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d, Michel Barnier has described the suggestion that such elements of the agreement could be carved out as \u201cfar from straightforward\u201d and insisted that the focus should be on getting the Brexit deal ratified. While emphasising that British nationals living in the EU would not be \u201cleft in the dark\u201d about their rights in the event of the UK leaving without a deal, he told Stephen Barclay that a range of problems existed in ringfencing the rights contained in the agreement, including the continued role of the European court of justice (ECJ). Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times by the Commons, the ECJ would give rulings on the interpretation of the rights contained in the agreement. There would be no legal basis for such an arrangement if the withdrawal agreement is not ratified by the Commons. \u201cOur joint efforts should remain focused on making sure that the withdrawal agreement will be ratified and will enter into force,\u201d Barnier wrote. \u201cWe should not be distracted from this essential objective.\u201d But in a letter sent by Barclay on Tuesday, and with the chances of a no-deal Brexit escalating, he appealed for a rethink and for \u201csustained\u201d efforts to reach a compromise, claiming that the efforts made by member states to protect the rights of British nationals had been imperfect. \u201cThere remain gaps in a number of areas and in a number of member states,\u201d Barclay wrote. \u201cI agree that our joint efforts should remain focused on making sure that we reach an agreement in order to secure an orderly departure for both the UK and the EU. However, I suggest that together our officials continue to work on how we best protect citizens\u2019 rights in all scenarios.\u201d Speaking at a press conference following a meeting with Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Barclay added that an EU-wide approach to guaranteeing citizens rights \u201cmade sense\u201d. But the Conservative MP Alberto Costa, who forced a government rethink on European citizens\u2019 post-Brexit rights through the tabling of a motion backed by the Commons, criticised the lack of effort by the Brexit secretary. \u201cThe UK government needs to do a lot lot more. Simply to write a letter to Barnier and expect a positive response is simply not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government have not been trying enough to secure EU citizens\u2019 rights.\u201d Tabling an urgent question in the Commons on Tuesday, Costa told MPs: \u201cIt is inconceivable that that British government, let alone a Conservative government, could allow the rights of British nationals, living, working, studying in the EU to vaporise on the 31 October.\u201d Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201csnake oil\u201d of the Conservative party \u201cwill again tonight on TV be claiming that no deal will present no difficulties\u201d. He said \u201cit will present no difficulties for them\u201d but would mean reciprocal healthcare for UK citizens retired in the EU would disappear. The Brexit under-secretary of state, Robin Walker, came under sustained criticism from MPs on the issue. He told MPs the government had written to all member states regarding healthcare and the government remained \u201ccommitted to delivering on citizens rights\u201d and had already secured a bilateral agreement on voting rights with Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg. Member states are, on the advice of the European commission, developing their own legislation to protect the rights of British nationals living in their countries but there are areas that remain uncovered. But Walker has expressed \u201cparticular concerns in relation to healthcare arrangements as these are not covered by the current proposals published by the commission\u201d. Barnier\u2019s response earlier this year had offered Barclay little succour. He wrote that the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement was part of an \u201coverall and comprehensive approach\u201d to Brexit that could not be picked apart. He pointed out that the Irish backstop, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, was one of the elements that was to the \u201cbenefit of people residing there\u201d. \u201cIt is therefore far from straightforward to identify which provisions would need to be \u2018carved out\u2019 as part of the ringfencing exercise proposed by the House of Commons in February, with the risk of unequal treatment of certain categories of citizens.\u201d Barclay\u2019s latest letter to the commission official insisted that there was growing support from the European parliament for the ring-fencing of rights, and that such a move had the support of EU nationals in the UK and British nationals in the EU. A spokesman for the 3million organisation representing the EU nationals living in the UK said: \u201cThe letter shows that the UK government has understood the need to safeguard our citizens\u2019 rights in case of no deal under the article 50 procedure. The EU must act now, so we can get on with our lives and stop being the bargaining chips of the Brexit negotiations.\u201d Campaign group British in Europe said \u201ca ringfenced withdrawal agreement is infinitely better\u201d than bi-laterals with 27 member states that could not resolve issues such as cross-border social security contributions for working people or health insurance for British pensioners in the EU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
