They are not going to save the two-match series yet it was heart-warming to witness such a spirited display, especially since India were threatening mayhem and humiliation at 320 for one. To bowl them out for 453 was a remarkable feat. But England cannot win the game. Graeme Swann, one of England's heroic figures \u2013 inevitably Andrew Flintoff was another \u2013 begs to differ. Swann is an engaging optimist and, on a personal level, he has much to be optimistic about. For the second match in succession he has out-bowled Monty Panesar. So when England next embark on a Test match \u2013 in Jamaica in February when a solitary spinner will be required \u2013 there is now a real chance that Swann will be preferred to Panesar. He was certainly preferred to Panesar by Kevin Pietersen in this innings, bowling twice as many overs. Swann was typically bubbly after the day's play. \"It is still a good pitch; it is still game on,\" he said. \"There are three days left and if we can get a big total anything is possible on the last day in Test cricket,\" which proves that Swann has not forgotten the Chennai match. Swann was more measured when invited to comment on the possibility of displacing Panesar in the pecking order. \"Look, I've played one-and-a-half Test matches so far. Each series I wonder 'Can I get a game in the next one?' I'll be delighted if I can get on the plane for the Caribbean. Monty's a class bowler. I'll be thrilled if I have anything like the success that he had at the start of his career.\" Swann is becoming a diplomat as well. He also gave an insight into the England dressing room in the wake of the Chennai defeat. \"After last week and the start of this match, either you feel sorry for yourself or you have a laugh.\" England, it seems, have tried to look on the bright side and that has helped. Their performance yesterday, even when they failed to take a wicket in an extended morning session, was wholly admirable. The spirit was always willing. Pietersen may lack the subtlety of a Brearley or a Hussain but he has his team playing for him. Getting through days like yesterday, when things seemed to be going pear-shaped, with heads held high, can help to forge a side together. That morning session, which began under low cloud at 9am was nightmarish for England. The umpires did well to start in such murk; there was enough movement with the old ball and then with the new one, which was taken as soon as it was available, to anticipate wickets, but in two-and-a-half hours Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid could not be parted. Dravid began to look the senior partner, which had not been the case on Friday. His defence was secure and he was more inclined to attack the bowling with trademark square cuts and flicks to leg. He's back. When he glided his 100th run down to long leg, his celebration of his 26th Test century was muted, yet his relief was obvious. Even the Englishmen on the ground found it hard to begrudge this gentleman's return to form. By contrast Gambhir, who has been in brilliant form recently, was flaky and fortunate. He posted his 1,000th Test run in this calendar year but there were as many edges as there were crisp boundaries. Flintoff peppered him and his footwork faltered; yet somehow he survived. Just before lunch he attacked both of the spinners, which must have left the England team with a queasy feeling at the interval. Six hundred was on the cards. There followed a remarkable session, in which India scored 54 for four in 28 overs. Swann, who was to bowl from the Pavilion End throughout the session finally, and deservedly, dismissed Gambhir, who sliced a drive to backward point. Four overs later Dravid, for the first time, sought to hit the ball in the air and a leading edge to mid-off gave Swann his second wicket. Now we saw a Kink in Sachin Tendulkar's armoury: he must have been \"so tired, tired of waiting\" and upon his arrival at the crease it soon became evident that the juices were not flowing after the highs of Chennai. He scratched around horribly and was eventually lbw to the off-spinner, attempting an unworthy paddle shot. If Ian Bell had played such a stroke we would be calling for his immediate dropping. But it was Tendulkar\u2026 so we won't. Now Flintoff embarked on a spell of six overs in which he conceded three runs and took one wicket \u2013 though it should have been two. He attacked VVS Laxman with short deliveries, which were defended in ungainly fashion. Then he pitched fuller and Laxman was late and lbw for a torrid 24-ball duck. England had taken four wickets for 19 runs and there should have been a fifth soon after. Flintoff now set about Yuvraj Singh with wonderful, controlled aggression. For a while Yuvraj \u2013 minus the swagger \u2013 defended stoutly. Then came the error, which produced the simplest of chances to gully, where a crestfallen Alastair Cook dropped the catch. Flintoff's reaction was instructive and symptomatic of England's mood. Somehow he managed a smile. Then he bowled three more superbly directed overs at high speed. It was an important blemish even though Yuvraj failed to produce a major innings. India scrambled another 100 runs. Panesar, the only England bowler with flattering figures, picked up a couple of wickets, while Flintoff deservedly despatched the tail. At 4.32pm, England were offered the light without facing a ball, whereupon the sun finally broke through in a surreal end to the day. Despite being batted out of the game there were also many rays of sunshine emanating from the England dressing room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
