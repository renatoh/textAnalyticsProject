He\u2019s a good person.\u201d Her words referred to Trump\u2019s infamous 2005 boast that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it \u2026 Grab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do anything\u201d. Trump referred to Gaga at his own Pennsylvania rally, saying she \u201cis not too good \u2026 I could tell you stories about Lady Gaga. I know a lot of stories.\u201d On Sunday, Trump\u2019s communications director Tim Murtagh tweeted: \u201cNothing exposes Biden\u2019s disdain for the forgotten working men &amp; women of PA like campaigning with anti-fracking activist Lady Gaga. This desperate effort to drum up enthusiasm is actually a sharp stick in the eye for 600,000 Pennsylvanians who work in the fracking industry.\u201d Gaga responded: \u201cI\u2019m glad to be living rent free in your head.\u201d At his Pennsylvania rally, Trump also criticised Jon Boni Jovi, Jay-Z, and LeBron James, who won the 2020 NBA championship with the LA Lakers in October. \u201cI didn\u2019t watch one shot, I got bored, back forth, back forth,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know why? When they don\u2019t respect our country, when they don\u2019t respect our flag, nobody wants to watch\u201d, a reference to the kneeling protests James and his team made on their return in July. James later endorsed Biden on Instagram, saying: \u201cWe need everything to change and it all starts tomorrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
