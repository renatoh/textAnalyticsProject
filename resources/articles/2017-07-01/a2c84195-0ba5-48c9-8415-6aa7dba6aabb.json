Many birds. No toe left unsucked. And a woman who saved the life of the man she loved by marrying a man she never will \u2013 and who has a very greasy face. Could Evil George be any more smug? Never mind snatching souls from the devil, Sam Carne. What will you do about this foul fiend? What a belter. There was less action and more psychological game-playing than last week, but an excellent episode nonetheless. \u201cIt is our duty to find happiness, in great things or small.\u201d Too right, Drake. And yet happiness is fleeting, like a toad hopping into a pond. How are we on episode six (of nine) already? T\u2019is a-passin\u2019 by too quickly. I have always enjoyed Poldark, though it must be said that previously a great deal of this \u201cenjoyment\u201d was code for \u201cgazing intently upon Aidan Turner with lust in mine heart\u201d. This season I really am both \u201cenjoying\u201d and enjoying Poldark. The pacing is good, the characterisation consistently excellent and there\u2019s a pleasing balance of drama and comedy. Toadgate was fun. \u201cWhat the hell are you playing at?\u201d \u201cToads.\u201d Morwenna and Drake\u2019s amphibious courtship was always doomed. The scenes between these two could have been cheesy but somehow managed to melt this cynical heart. She couldn\u2019t look him in the eye and say she didn\u2019t love him. I see now where I\u2019ve been going wrong all these years; no man has ever wanted to catch a basketful of toads for me. \u201cThese are not the toads we got rid of before. Maybe they walked here. Or maybe they been brought?\u201d In the end it wasn\u2019t the toads that did for Drake, but Geoffrey Charles\u2019 weird bible. To Truro jail \u2013 a capital offence! \u201cWhat\u2019s to be done?\u201d \u201cThe boy is charged. There is nothing more to say.\u201d Before that, I wasn\u2019t sure about the scene on the beach. If anyone saw Miss Morwenna with a man with a naked torso, it would have been a scandal beyond all imagining, surely? \u201cOur family is tainted by our association with you.\u201d I know Evil George was responsible for all this in the end. But will Morwenna work out that it was sort of Geoffrey Charles\u2019 fault, really? Never be generous with your ornate Bible. Meanwhile Dr Enys\u2019 welts seemed to be migrating all over his face from one scene to the next, and he had developed a variant of post-traumatic stress disorder no amount of almond biscuits could cure. \u201cA life of quiet luxury ...\u201d I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go for that. Finally we see Sindy Doll with her hair down. Oh, the sadness of rejection by a pock-marked man who would rather read a book. \u201cIf a man\u2019s wife cannot help him, who can?\u201d Indeed. And yet she could not help. \u201cYou never used to be so girlish ...\u201d Oh dear. They needed some 21st-century sensibility to save him. \u201cShe seems incapable of imagining what it is like to come back to a life that is utterly vacuous.\u201d Instead, the cure turned out to be a little light bromance and some poetry recommendation. There were many highlights in this heady mix. Mr Whitworth\u2019s toe sex \u2013 God\u2019s holy work \u2013 was hilarious. \u201cA man has needs. If they remain unfulfilled by his wife ...\u201d Equally lasciviously brilliant was Evil George eating strawberries in bed, and the constant focus on his creepy restless fingers. My favourite scene, though, was Sindy Doll and Dwight in her massive garden. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me?\u201d \u201cNo. My desire to return to the Navy is not for want of love for you.\u201d But he is too accustomed to the cries of wounded men, he has slept too long on crusty straw and he has no appetite for delicacies. Beautifully spoken by Luke Norris, who essentially summarised the point of psychoanalysis decades before Freud invented it. But of course she can bear with him. Sindy Doll can bear anything. Horace the pug will help too. Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor \u201cA note in Aunt Agatha\u2019s hand?\u201d Of course it is. Let us raise a toast to Aunt Agatha (Caroline Blakiston) yet again. She had plenty to do in this episode and her contribution was, as always, magnificent. The bit where she was watching Mr Whitworth from the balcony was perfect. And I love how much she\u2019s looking forward to her 100th birthday. \u201cProof that I outlasted any Poldark afore me!\u201d She needs to be measured for a new dress first, though. Not a coffin, thanks very much, Evil George. But her best line this week? \u201cRoasting the Frenchies. Whatever next?\u201d It helps that Ross\u2019s face is a picture whenever he looks at Aunt Agatha. Long may she reign. Classic Poldark lines \u201cThere be nothing more for me here, sister. I must find a new purpose.\u201d Just stay and wash your chest in the stream more often, mate. \u201cIn France, he beat 20 men single-handed.\u201d Not quite, but who are we to stand in the way of a good story? \u201cCarnal love be damned in the eyes of the Lord.\u201d Listen, Sam. We have tuned in for carnal love. Don\u2019t judge us. \u201cHope is never as dead as one fears. And marriage between two classes never impossible.\u201d Sadly while Mr Whitworth is still able to suck toes, all hope is dead. Kill him, Morwenna. Death by a thousand toads. Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment Who needs bare chests when you can have an injured back? Despite some lumberjacking and rock-breaking from Ross in a smock top, it was all about Drake\u2019s carnal love with Morwenna tonight. The scenes between them were enough to make a toad blush. Next week ... A new MP for Truro? It\u2019s Aunt Agatha\u2019s 100th birthday. Mr Whitworth turns nasty. And Evil George realises the rickety baby (aka The Crooked Mite) is not his ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
