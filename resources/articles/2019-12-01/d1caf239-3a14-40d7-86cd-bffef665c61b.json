The Liverpool manager, along with his assistants Peter Krawietz and Pepijn Lijnders, has committed to the next five years at Anfield and will become the club\u2019s longest-serving manager since Bob Paisley by the end of his third contract. Liverpool\u2019s owner, Fenway Sports Group, had been trying to extend Klopp\u2019s deal since the end of last season when his transformation of the club yielded a sixth European Cup triumph. The 52-year-old spent seven years at both of his previous clubs \u2013 Mainz and Borussia Dortmund \u2013 and was on course for a similar stay on Merseyside with his current \u00a37m-a-year contract due to expire in 2022. But he has committed to the longest spell of his managerial career to oversee a gradual rebuilding of the team and because he could not imagine leaving Liverpool in three years\u2019 time. Klopp said: \u201cThis squad in the moment is outstanding, we all love it, but we have to stay on track as other teams don\u2019t sleep and we don\u2019t sleep. We have to see what we change, what we don\u2019t change. All of these decisions should be made out of a real comfortable situation. When you are in, you should be responsible for all that stuff and I feel responsible for it. When I leave at any point in my life it is important that it is still in a very good place. \u201cWe will have to refresh things in moments. This team will always be the core set, the basis for all other teams following, and there is no need to make the same number of changes that we made in the last four and a half years in the next four and a half years. Absolutely not. This is an outstanding team but of course there will be things. A player might want to leave, then we have to bring in the right replacement. To keep the level we are on we have to be really on our toes and to be on your toes you need to sometimes change a little bit and that is what we will do.\u201d Klopp believes his new deal will be important for stability and enticing new players. A deal to sign the Salzburg playmaker Takumi Minamino has been agreed for January. He said: \u201cWhen you want to bring new players in they ask: \u2018How long is the manager going to be here?\u2019 We all wanted to avoid that so it\u2019s done and I am really happy about that.\u201d Klopp added: \u201cWhen the club asked me and I thought about the contract and then I thought about ending, I couldn\u2019t imagine I would leave. Then we could start thinking about how long I wanted to stay. If, in the end [of my career], I only had three clubs then I had three sensational clubs and that would be OK for me.\u201d Liverpool hold a commanding eight-point lead in the Premier League as they pursue a first league title in 30 years and will aim next week to land a first Club World Cup. The European champions have also made substantial progress off the pitch, too, with plans unveiled recently to construct a new Anfield Road stand that, following the Main Stand redevelopment, would increase the stadium\u2019s capacity to more than 61,000. A new \u00a350m training complex in Kirkby is due for completion in the summer of 2020. Liverpool\u2019s principal owner, John Henry, the chairman, Tom Werner, and FSG president, Mike Gordon, issued a joint statement to express their delight at Klopp\u2019s willingness to extend his stay. It read: \u201cWe feel this represents one of the big moments of our stewardship of Liverpool Football Club so far as we believe there is no better manager than J\u00fcrgen.\u201d Liverpool have also announced a new contract for James Milner, who has committed his future to the club until 2022. The 33-year-old\u2019s previous deal was due to expire next summer but, with Klopp anxious to retain the influential midfielder, he has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
