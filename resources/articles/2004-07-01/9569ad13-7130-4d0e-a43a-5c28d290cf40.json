England's cricketers finally bucked the national sporting trend last night when they thrashed West Indies by seven wickets with 28 overs to spare to record their first win in the NatWest Series and keep alive their hopes of reaching the final on July 10. The speed with which England were branded sporting flops - less than three weeks after whitewashing New Zealand in the Test series - was tabloid amnesia at its most convenient. So a crushing win was just what the doctor ordered after the hangovers induced by Roomania and Henmania. It was hard to escape the feeling, however, that the prescription remains muddled. At Trent Bridge and Chester-le-Street, England paid the price for picking a side containing only three specialist batsmen. Here, they picked one containing three specialist bowlers - and somehow got away with it. Out went Ashley Giles and Ian Blackwell; in came Robert Key and, to everyone's surprise, Andrew Flintoff, who was supposed to have missed the entire series because of a foot injury and was picked as a batsman only. Had it not been for the excellence of Steve Harmison and James Anderson, who took six for 68 between them to help skittle West Indies for 159, the policy might have backfired spectacularly. \"We were fortunate today, because we got away with it, but you can't get away with it in every game,\" said the England captain Michael Vaughan. \"We knew it was a little bit of a gamble, but that's the situation we're in because of Flintoff's injury. With them only batting 40 overs, it saved us having to get another 10 overs from someone else.\" Only a few days ago Vaughan was insisting that England could win without the hulking might of Flintoff, and the coach Duncan Fletcher was making the case for a settled side. Yesterday, both policies deferred to the desperate need for points in a competition that was threatening to leave England behind. \"You can call it a panic measure,\" said the chairman of selectors David Graveney, pre-empting the inevitable criticism. \"We're calling it using the resources available. Flintoff's fitness has progressed at a greater rate than anyone imagined and that changed the scenario. He's the talisman of the team and his very presence is good for morale.\" But with Flintoff still hampered by a bony growth on his left foot, England's attack looked desperately top-heavy. Anthony McGrath, a jobbing seamer, came on as second change, while Marcus Trescothick, who had sent down fewer than 14 overs in 82 one-day internationals before yesterday, was the fifth bowler. \"Harmison was outstanding,\" said Vaughan. \"There's no other way to describe him. He's now a world-class performer in both forms of cricket. I wouldn't like to be standing 22 yards away from him at the moment.\" Brian Lara looked like a man uncomfortably reminded of the recent series in the Caribbean. \"He reminds me of Curtly Ambrose,\" he said. When the Tests get underway on July 22, it could be another long series for West Indies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
