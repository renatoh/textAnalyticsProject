Formby\u2019s candidacy has been keenly promoted by Corbyn\u2019s office, and supportive Labour MPs include Chris Williamson, and party chair Ian Lavery. But other trade unions were initially concerned at what they regarded as a Unite stitch-up \u2013 and Jon Lansman, leader of the pro-Corbyn grassroots campaign group Momentum, put himself forward, complaining about \u201cmachine\u201d politics inside Labour. Lansman withdrew his name on Sunday and, with the GMB\u2019s backing, Formby appears almost certain to clinch the post, which is voted on by members of the party\u2019s ruling national executive committee. In a statement, the GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a small decision, we\u2019ve taken time as a union to discuss it, to think about where Labour needs to be. \u201cGMB members first and foremost need a Labour government, and we need our party to understand us. Jennie has been a trade unionist for decades. I have no doubt she understands the challenges and issues working people face and that she\u2019ll do everything she can to put them at the heart of Labour\u2019s campaign for government.\u201d The post became vacant after the party\u2019s longstanding general secretary Iain McNicol announced his departure. McNicol was controversial with many Corbyn supporters because of his role in the row over which party members could vote in the 2016 Labour leadership contest; but he worked closely with the leaders\u2019 office during last year\u2019s general election. Another high-profile departure was announced on Tuesday, with Emilie Oldknow, one of the party\u2019s executive directors, emailing staff to say she would be \u201cleaving in the summer to pursue some new and exciting opportunities\u201d. One senior party figure said: \u201cShe ran the Labour party, Iain was the general secretary in name only \u2013 her departure is far more significant than Iain\u2019s.\u201d There have been a series of resignations in recent months as Corbyn\u2019s team continue transforming Labour party machinery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
