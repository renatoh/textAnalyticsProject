The country's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, admitted Russia is going through a \"difficult time\" economically but urged private investors to honour their commitments to Sochi. This year's budget for the Olympstroi company \u2013 the state company overseeing much of the construction work \u2013 was originally set at nearly 50bn roubles (\u00a3960m), but it will now be cut by 33bn (\u00a3634m), the regional development minister, Viktor Basargin, said in a meeting with Putin's council on sports. Russia's economy has suffered hugely over the past year, particularly from nose-diving oil prices, raising questions about its ability to put on the Games. Basargin added that some of this year's cuts would be offset by money that had been budgeted in the past two years but not used. Olympstroi's chief executive said 12bn roubles from last year was not spent. The bad news was also leavened by the organisers' announcement of a US$180m (\u00a3124m) top-tier sponsorship deal with the state oil company, Rosneft. Putin had a message for other private investors yet to follow through with support for the project. \"However hard it is, one should begin financing the projects or give them back to us,\" he said, without naming the companies or specific projects. Some of Russia's biggest corporations have committed to various projects ranging from roads to construction of ski resorts. Most have been badly hit by the economic crisis, including the billionaire Oleg Deripaska's investment vehicle Basic Element, which is supposed to play a big role in delivering the Games. Deripaska has recently sold some of his assets and is facing margin calls from creditors. He has been widely reported to be asking for government aid for his failing enterprises. Putin mentioned that 20 Olympic projects \u2013 which he described as \"commercially lucrative\" \u2013 still have not attracted investors. Sports officials said after the meeting that these include the construction of four Olympic sites, hotels and power-stations, none of which has been offered to investors yet. The Sochi plan requires construction of almost all the venues and for huge infrastructure projects, including a light-rail line to connect the ice sports venues along the Black Sea coast with the snow sports area in the mountains some 30 miles to the east."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
