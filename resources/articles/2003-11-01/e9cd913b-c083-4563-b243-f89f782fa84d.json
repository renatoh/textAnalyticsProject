Brown, 24, suffered the injury during the win at Everton on the final day of last season, and his return is considered a bonus for the manager Sir Alex Ferguson as his key defender Rio Ferdinand has a long suspension looming. \"Wes started doing bits of training with the young players last week,\" Ferguson said. \"He will be continuing with that as well. He is making quicker progress than we expected. \"We anticipated it would be the new year before we could think about a comeback - but now we hope we can bring that forward. I think we will now be looking for a reserve match for him at the beginning of the next month. If all goes well I could have him in the first-team squad for the festive period. We are all pleased because he's had a tough time.\" Gary Neville, meanwhile, is struggling to be fit for Saturday morning's match at Blackburn after suffering a recurrence of an Achilles problem. Marseille intend to keep hold of Manchester United's third-string goalkeeper Fabien Barthez for the rest of the season, even though his loan was blocked by Fifa last month. Marseille have appealed against the decision because the proposed move would have been outside the official transfer window. \"Barthez will stay at Marseille until June. The question is when will he play,\" said the president Christoph\u00e9 Bouchet. \"To send Barthez back to Manchester United if Fifa failed to grant us permission would be the worst solution for everybody.\" The president added that a clause in a deal signed with Manchester United stated that the France goalkeeper could not sign for any other club until June, and stated that Marseille are already paying a share of the player's wages. The transfer window opens in January and Bouchet said Marseille and United had agreed that a final decision will be made by January 9. Hertha Berlin have taken Mustapha Hadji, 32, on trial with a view to a permanent move. The Moroccan midfielder has been frozen out at Aston Villa since the appointment of David O'Leary as manager and would be available on a free-transfer when the window reopens in January. Gillingham have held talks with Professional Footballers' Association deputy chief executive Mick McGuire to help review the financial situation at the First Division club, who are struggling on and off the pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
