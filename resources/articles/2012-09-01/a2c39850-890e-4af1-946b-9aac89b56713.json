Imagine how he will feel if he beats him. At 9.24pm on Thursday night the two men will take to the track for the T44 100m final, along with the six other quickest amputees in the world. It was already set up to be one of the showpiece events of the Paralympic athletics but it looks even more exciting now. Pistorius squared off against Brazil's Alan Oliveira, the man who beat him in the 200m final, again on Wednesday night. This time the two were running the final leg of the T42/46 4x100m relay and it was Pistorius who won. He led his team to gold, in a world record time of 41.78sec. Oliveira came up on his shoulder in the final few metres, just as he had in the 200m final, but Pistorius was able to hold him off. There was a measure of redemption for that defeat then, but now all eyes will be on the 100m final. Peacock, a 19-year-old from Cambridge, will start as favourite. He won his heat with ease, equalling the Paralympic record of 11.08. Pistorius was the next fastest but was still 0.1 slower. Peacock beat Oliveira and the silver medallist from Beijing, the USA's Jerome Singleton, by more than 0.3. He admitted he had expected both men to \"push him a little more\". They may have been saving a little for the relay later in the evening. \"I know that Jonnie was ready,\" said Singleton. \"He's in front of his home crowd and he wanted to put on a show. It's going to be a very tough race. You've got some of the best amputees in the world who are going to line up here.\" Pistorius has not run a personal best in the 100m for more than five years and has said his aim here was simply to make the podium. \"I was at the top for many years and, if the sport's evolved, that's one of the best things that could ever have happened.\" He may have changed his attitude since Sunday night, feeling he has more to prove. A little over two months ago one would have got long odds on Peacock being the one Pistorius would have to beat. But then on 1 July Peacock broke the T44 world record, taking it down to 10.85. That is the kind of time he will be looking to run in the final. \"It was a bad wind, a big wind,\" he said. \"I'll be a bit quicker in the final.\" Peacock was not all that happy with his performance. He says he will sit down with his coach, Dan Pfaff, and analyse the tape of the race. \"The end of the race wasn't as controlled as I'd like it to be \u2013 I need to keep my core stronger \u2013 and my start could have been better.\" Pfaff has helped Peacock knock almost a second off his personal best in the last year, an improvement that made Pistorius sit up and take notice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
