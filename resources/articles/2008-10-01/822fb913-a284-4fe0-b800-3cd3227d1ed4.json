McCain was the only senior Republican calling for Stevens to step aside in the wake of his conviction on seven counts of criminal corruption, delivered yesterday by a jury in Washington. But the 40-year veteran of Congress found few vocal defenders among his former colleagues. \"It is a sign of the health of our democracy that the people continue to hold their representatives to account for improper or illegal conduct, but this verdict is also a sign of the corruption and insider-dealing that has become so pervasive in our nation's capital,\" McCain said in a statement issued today. \"It is clear that Senator Stevens has broken his trust with the people and that he should now step down.\" The Stevens conviction deals a fresh blow to a Republican camp already grappling with dire political prospects seven days before polls open in the US. Though there was no love lost between McCain and Stevens, the latter senator has long symbolised a culture of conservative dominance in Congress and government patronage for Alaska \u2013 the home state of McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin. In fact, Palin's initial response to the verdict attracted a rush of questions over whether she and McCain agreed on the need for Stevens to step down. In a statement late yesterday, Palin asked her 84-year-old senator to \"do what's right for the people of Alaska\" but issued no resignation call. By this morning, however, McCain and Palin were singing from the same hymnal. Hours after McCain urged Stevens to resign, Barack Obama echoed the call, while taking pains to depict the convicted senator as one cog in a larger, corrupt political class. \"Stevens' resignation won't solve anything on its own,\" Obama said in a statement. \"It's clear that if we're going to put the economy back on track and provide relief to working Americans, we're going to have to change the way that Washington works.\" Stevens faces up to 35 years in prison after the jury found him guilty of lying on government financial reports to conceal more than $250,000 (\u00a3158,950) worth of lavish gifts he received from an oil executive. He vowed yesterday to continue standing for re-election in Alaska, where polls show Democratic challenger Mark Begich in the lead. Staying true to his passionate persona, Stevens declared his innocence and accused government prosecutors of mishandling his case. \"I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have,\" the eight-term senator said in a statement. Whether he will have enough support to do so \u2013 both from Alaskan voters and fellow legislators \u2013 remains to be seen, however. A senator can be removed from his post if two-thirds of his 99 colleagues vote for expulsion, a move that last occurred during the US civil war in 1862. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader currently locked in a difficult re-election battle of his own, offered scant comfort to Stevens after the verdict. \"Senator Stevens was found guilty by a jury of his peers and now must face the consequences of those actions,\" McConnell said yesterday. \"As a result of his conviction, Senator Stevens will be held accountable so the public trust can be restored.\" Before any ethical inquiry or expulsion vote, Stevens must receive the verdict of Alaska's voters. A state poll taken just before the conviction found Begich, the Democrat, on 46% and Stevens on 45%. One vote Stevens may still have: Palin's. The Republican vice-presidential nominee declined to reveal yesterday whether she would vote for him in Alaska, although McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds told MSNBC somewhat cryptically that Palin would not \"cast [her] ballot for Ted Stevens if [she] were [a voter in] Alaska\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
