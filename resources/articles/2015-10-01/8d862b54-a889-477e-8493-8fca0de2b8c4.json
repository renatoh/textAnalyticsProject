Roux, the former MasterChef: The Professionals presenter who quit the BBC last year and will front new Channel 4 series, Kitchen Impossible, said there were \u201cpossibly too many\u201d TV cookery shows. He took aim at series in which contestants have to outdo each other in the kitchen and programmes that \u201cglorify the chef and put us on a pedestal\u201d. \u201cBeating people is not the best way to approach life. It\u2019s wrong,\u201d Roux told the new issue of Radio Times, when asked about BBC1\u2019s MasterChef and The Great British Bake Off. The hit BBC1 baking show ended its current series, won by Nadiya Hussain, with more than 13 million viewers earlier this month, the biggest television audience of the year. Roux said TV cookery shows \u201ccan glorify the chef and put us on a pedestal. I worry about that; it brings young people into our industry for the wrong reasons\u201d. He said: \u201cThey think they are going to be the next Jamie [Oliver] or Gordon [Ramsay]. But it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. They don\u2019t realise that actually Jamie, Gordon and myself worked our backsides off to get to where we are.\u201d Roux, who left the BBC after refusing to give up his paid endorsement of Bartlett potatoes, backed Oliver\u2019s recent public attack on sugar and said government health advice was often \u201cunclear and confused\u201d. \u201cNatural fats, dairy fats, are good for you in moderation. Sugar is the enemy, always has been. Look at the label, if there\u2019s anything with \u2018ose\u2019 on the end, put it down,\u201d he said. \u201cChefs who are in the media have a duty to get the message across \u2013 we should be teaching our children to eat properly. We should be spending more time in the kitchen, even if it\u2019s only once or twice a week. \u201cThere are major health issues out there \u2013 if we can help by giving advice about how to cook and what we eat then it can only be good.\u201d He added: \u201cThere have been at least two generations of mothers no longer cooking at home and no longer passing on their basic cooking knowledge. That is part of the problem.\u201d Roux\u2019s new Channel 4 series will put eight people with disabilities, including Asperger\u2019s syndrome, autism and Down\u2019s syndrome, through an intensive four-week introduction to catering. \u201cDon\u2019t call them contestants,\u201d Roux told the listings magazine. \u201cThey\u2019re not competing. \u201cI had never encountered them before so it was very hard, but I adapted. Tourette syndrome, though. The physical ticks, the very very crude language\u2026 Tourette syndrome absolutely shocked me.\u201d Roux said he was \u201cnot a celebrity chef. A celebrity chef is a chef who spends more time on television than in their kitchen. The television work that I have done is a by-product of my job, it has never ever taken over my life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
