Luis, her son, liked going to visit her there more than to the hospital, not realising what her move to a palliative care centre really meant. He liked watching the big guppy in the fish tank kiss the glass when he pressed his face up against it. He\u2019d kick a football down the corridors; seven years old and often straight from school in his too-big uniform, polished black shoes loudly slapping the lino as he ran to her room. I call Luis my nephew because Billie was always more of a sister to me. Throughout her six-year illness \u2013 she was diagnosed with a brain tumour at 26 and died at 31 \u2013 I helped look after Luis. He was just two when Billie had the first operation and although she did her best to carry on as a young working mother (she was a really in-demand makeup artist), I know she appreciated that family and friends babysat when we could. One evening, not long after that life-changing diagnosis, I went over to Billie\u2019s small flat in west London, which she shared with Luis and her best friend, Hannah. I had a cheap bottle of wine with me and was ready to ask her all about how she was coping after the first round of radiotherapy. But she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She asked me questions about my life \u2013 I\u2019d just graduated and was a few months into my first job. We poured big glasses of the wine \u2013 she never paid much attention to doctors\u2019 suggestions that she should quit drinking \u2013 and laughed so loudly we forgot that Luis was asleep. It was inconceivable to me then that she wouldn\u2019t survive, but as I tiptoed past Luis\u2019s room, his name spelt out in wooden letters on the door, I had a crushing flash-forward: what if she didn\u2019t? \u201cI\u2019ll always look out for him you know,\u201d I said without planning to. \u201cLike, whatever happens, I\u2019ll always make sure he\u2019s OK. I promise.\u201d Billie brushed this off, changed the subject, hit play on Madonna\u2019s Ray of Light. But I\u2019d made a promise I meant to keep. Today, Luis is 16. He\u2019s studying at the same sixth-form college his mother went to. He lives with his grandmother. His room used to be Billie\u2019s childhood room. But it\u2019s painted blue now. We hang out a couple of times a month and he insists I stick his left AirPod in my ear so he can play me \u201chis music\u201d \u2013 London drill and rap \u2013 and translate the lyrics: \u201cSo basically a trap house is where you sell drugs.\u201d Yes, I know that one, I\u2019ve watched Top Boy. \u201cA Glock is a gun.\u201d Yes, I know. \u201cAll right then, what\u2019s OT?\u201d I rack the somewhat patchy urban dictionary in my brain. OK Luis, you\u2019ve got me there. He\u2019ll explain it means out of town. Which sounds innocent enough, but given the context probably isn\u2019t. I\u2019ll ask in a slightly panicked but non-judgmental tone if the life described in these songs is relatable to him. \u201cNaaaaaah. That\u2019s not for me,\u201d he\u2019ll say, cringing slightly, and I believe him. I understand why the raw desperation and anger of that music appeals to Luis. He\u2019s not endured the same endemic hardships that artists such as Loski describes in his controversial tracks, but he knows pain and he knows injustice. He lost his mum before he finished primary school. He only sees his dad occasionally, as he lives out of London \u2013 Billie and he had split up soon after Luis was born. \u201cAll I feel is anger,\u201d he told me over a Nando\u2019s recently. \u201cI\u2019m not like other people. I just honestly don\u2019t feel anything except anger. I never cry.\u201d It was one of those conversations that came out of nowhere, and I\u2019m not sure I said the right thing back, but I listened and reminded him he could always talk to me, and by the time he finished his burger he was telling me in great detail about some rapper who\u2019d just got out of prison as if the previous conversation had never happened. Growing up in west London, Luis is on the edge of \u201cstreet\u201d culture. He knows what\u2019s what and goes to the right chicken shops with the right people, but he also lives with his 64-year-old grandma and is surrounded by a close family of arty, middle-class women: my mother, my other cousin Romy, and his godmother Hannah. He\u2019s forever walking into the living room to find us all gabbing about Strictly, listening to the Rolling Stones and dancing embarrassingly after drinking too much prosecco. I\u2019m confident his ability to shift between worlds and hold his own with boys on street corners and tipsy older ladies in Cos dresses and statement necklaces will stand him in good stead for life. After the funeral I made regular plans to take Luis out. We did physical things together: I\u2019d set him obstacle courses, we\u2019d race between trees in the park, we went to climbing centres, trampolining, and crazy golf. But if I ever tried to bring up \u201cfeelings\u201d he\u2019d simply not engage \u2013 he was a baby really, and no child is equipped to deal with the loss of a parent. I\u2019m not surprised he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Instead we\u2019d share mega tubs of popcorn at the Imax and get lost in superhero movies. These things made me feel better too. Playing with Luis between the ages of seven and 12, and getting drawn into his epic imaginary worlds and silly, surreal, schoolboy conversations helped me deal with my grief. He was so full of life, just like Billie, and being with him always lifted my spirits. He\u2019d mention Billie anecdotally \u2013 \u201cOh yeah, I went there with my mum\u201d \u2013 as if she was still alive. But over time, once he turned teenage, he started forgetting those small things about her and he talked about her less and less. Now, he tells me, \u201cI don\u2019t think I remember her at all.\u201d Once, when he was nine, Luis used the notebook and pen I\u2019d bought him to write \u201cI hate you I hate you I hate you\u201d over and over again. He screwed up the paper and threw it at me. \u201cI\u2019m angry she died too,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I love you and nothing you ever say or do will change that.\u201d Two years ago, we went as a family to a music festival in London to watch Romy perform with her band The xx. Luis has been dragged along to most of her gigs over the years, and while he always said he enjoyed them, he\u2019d often be caught playing a game on his phone during one of the concert\u2019s most emotional moments, (I mean, they were no Krept and Konan, that\u2019s for sure), or asking when we\u2019d be able to leave. But this time he was older, and it was different. Romy walked to the centre of the stage to sing Brave for You, a song she wrote about her own experiences of grief (Romy lost both her parents in her early 20s), with 40,000 fans screaming and clapping for her and lightning hitting like a brilliant clich\u00e9 in the late evening sky above. I noticed Luis was really watching, for once. As the song ended and ramped up into the euphoric opening of Loud Places, he put his arm round me and his grandma and we jumped up and down together, wildly singing along: \u201cDidn\u2019t I take you to/ higher places, you/ can\u2019t reach without me\u201d. It was the most un-self-conscious I\u2019d ever seen him, and it made me feel that I\u2019d kept my promise to Billie well. He was going to be OK. We all were. Luis is a good kid. He doesn\u2019t drink, even if his friends do. He hates smoking and won\u2019t touch drugs. He\u2019s obsessed with luxury fashion and will happily spend a day in Selfridges (probably the closest thing we have in common). This summer we went on our first family holiday to Ibiza, and when he wasn\u2019t making endless jokes about how small I am compared to his lanky 6ft-something, we talked like we never had before. After dinner we lay on sunloungers, looking up at the stars and contemplating the enormity of the universe together. It felt like our relationship was shifting into something new. Luis wears his mum\u2019s diamond ring. It\u2019s \u201cdripping\u201d, as he says (\u201cdrip\u201d is the new \u201cbling\u201d FYI) and I know the time will come when he\u2019s ready to find out more about her. At the moment, though, he\u2019s keeping her close in his own way. Billie would be so proud.
