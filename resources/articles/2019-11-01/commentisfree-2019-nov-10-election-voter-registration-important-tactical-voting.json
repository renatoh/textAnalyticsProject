Yet amid all the claim and counter-claim, there\u2019s been little discussion about one thing that will have a far greater impact: voter turnout. And, just as critical, voter registration. As we prepare for the most volatile poll in our lives, the potential power of those not yet on the electoral roll is huge. The white, middle-aged \u201cWorkington man\u201d has been crowned this year\u2019s key swing voter, but those who our parties really need to energise are those who may never have voted before \u2013 in particular, the young. Their votes could be decisive. The early signs suggest youth turnout is heading for a historic high. Applications to register to vote have gone through the roof since the election was announced. The 2017 election witnessed the famous \u201cyouthquake\u201d. Hopes of a repeat might be premature, but the jump in young people using their voice this Christmas does have the potential to be even more profound \u2013 well over 100,000 under-25s registered within 48 hours of the election being called, a 60% higher rate than the corresponding pre-election period in 2017. This is in spite of genuine concerns around voter suppression \u2013 the election is being held in the final week of university term, and new voter ID laws will erect further barriers for those already less likely to be on the register. Yet young people have an edge: the million or so of us at university can register in two places. We can use tools, such as this one by Antonio Voce, which tell us where \u2013 at home or at university \u2013 our vote will be most effective. Since 2017, millions of our generation have participated in democracy in new, innovative and often effective ways. On issues spanning the climate crisis, Brexit and period poverty, those set to inherit a country limping from problem to problem have proved themselves influential political actors \u2013 while our supposedly responsible, better informed elders bickered among themselves and brought the country to a constitutional standstill. These registration numbers might be passing politicians by, but campaigns such as the non-partisan Vote For Your Future are throwing all they can into ensuring our generation is registered. We\u2019re under no illusion that we face a huge challenge: the Electoral Commission estimates that one in three young people is missing from the electoral register. This figure \u2013 of 5 million 18- to 34-year-olds \u2013 doesn\u2019t even include many who will be incorrectly registered for 12 December, having moved homes recently or failed to sign up in their university seat. But we believe young people can and will convert a year of energising protest \u2013 most notably Extinction Rebellion, the school climate strikes and the Brexit marches \u2013 into a historic turnout. When I asked the first-time voter Eden Reyhanian, 18, whether all this direct action might make young people give up on voting \u2013 which might be considered a less exciting way to change society \u2013 she told me: \u201cIt isn\u2019t an either-or for us. This is a massive election for young people, who know their sacrifices could come to nothing if they don\u2019t vote.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve watched from the sidelines for the last few years of political crisis and now we finally get to have our say, and there\u2019s a massive appetite to be involved.\u201d Eden\u2019s constituency, Finchley and Golders Green in north London, was won by just 1,657 votes in 2017. She recognises she\u2019s lucky: her voice really does count. In the US, many companies whose main customers are Gen Z or millennials promote registration as an integral element of corporate responsibility. Uber offered a free lift to the polling station in last year\u2019s US midterms, Patagonia offered its workers a day off to go and vote. A similar trend seems to have tentatively made its way across the Atlantic: companies such as Proper, Grindr, Innocent and Lucy &amp; Yak are drawing up plans to get young people engaged. But it shouldn\u2019t be down to campaigners like us, or private companies. It\u2019s shocking that there is still no single governmental body responsible for filling the registration gaps, and educational institutions too rarely pick up the pieces. Our recent research in association with Times Higher Education found the gulf between registration practices at a university such as Sheffield \u2013 which designed integrated enrolment in 2014 \u2013 and the majority of other institutions is shameful. Five years on, few have followed Sheffield\u2019s lead when they should really be legally compelled to do so. Yet young people are on track for a higher turnout than ever before and, if we succeed, it will be because a year of remarkable campaigning can and must find its place in electoral politics, too. I\u2019d urge everyone, please, register to vote today. It really could make a decisive difference. \u2022 Lara Spirit is director of Vote For Your Future"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
