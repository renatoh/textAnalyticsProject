Baxter has dyed his hair blue and white in the shape of the Cross of St Andrew, the Scottish flag, in recognition of the fact that he comes from Aviemore and is nicknamed \"The Highlander\". But the British Olympic Association is concerned that it could be construed that the 28-year-old is making a political statement in the light of the fact that, since Scotland was granted devolution from London, some officials in Edinburgh have called for a separate Scottish Olympic team. \"There is nothing in the athletes' agreement which precludes him from doing what he has done,\" said Philip Pope, the BOA spokesman. \"But under the IOC charter you are not allowed to make a political statement and this could be deemed exactly that.\" Baxter is Britain's most accomplished skier for 20 years and is unlikely to endanger his chances of a medal for the sake of a publicity stunt. Pope said that he expected Baxter to cover the white cross so that his hairstyle would no longer resemble the Scottish flag. \"It is not something we can judge and we have left it entirely up to him,\" said Pope. Earlier in the games Baxter's cousin, the snowboarder Lesley McKenna, was forced to remove Scottish flag from her attire before competing in the half-pipe. It was a bad day for Scotland at the Ogden Ice Sheet yesterday when Britain's women curlers, skipped by Irvine's Rhona Martin, suffered a second consecutive defeat which almost certainly ended their involvement in the tournament. They needed to win only one of their last two matches to be sure of a place in tomorrow's semi-final, but after losing to the United States 6-5 on Sunday night they were beaten 7-5 by Germany yesterday. Britain could still qualify, but only if Switzerland beat Germany. That would result in a play-off between Britain, Germany and, possibly, Sweden. \"We're out,\" said Martin. \"Switzerland are not going to do anyone any favours.\" The defeat against the USA was especially disappointing, Martin losing a two-point lead on the final end to draw. The home country then won in the extra end. Britain were also in control against the Germans only to let things slip away again during the fourth end. It was a tearful Martin who came off the sheet afterwards. \"The Germans played well and we couldn't get back into it,\" said Martin. \"We had two matches and we knew we had to win one of them so to lose both is very disappointing.\" With Hammy McMillan's team also failing to justify their pre-Olympic tag as medal contenders, the performances of the curlers have been among the most disappointing aspects of these games from Britain's point of view. \"It was in our own hands and it's pity it's come to this,\" said Martin, who is nicknamed Mrs Merton by her team-mates. There is sure to be a heated debate after this. The closest team event in Olympic history ended yesterday with Germany beating Finland in the team K120 ski jumping by 974.1 points to 974. \"We were not better, maybe just luckier,\" said Germany's Michael Uhrmann. \"But frankly when the first position lights up you do not care by what margin.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
