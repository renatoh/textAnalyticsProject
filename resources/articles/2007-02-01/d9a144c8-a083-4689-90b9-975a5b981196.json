It is less than a fortnight since the ex-foreign secretary turned leader of the Commons announced the latest blueprint for a 50% elected Lords, with 30% appointed by the parties through a cleaned-up procedure and 20% drawn from among the non-party great and good. No one liked it but that is normal for all proposals to reform the Lords. That is why reform has stalled for most of the last 100 years, the notably exception being in 1999 when the Blair government expelled all but 92 of the hereditaries. Where Straw got into most trouble however was his Cunning Plan to break the deadlock by forcing MPs to use the alternative vote system (AV) to break the deadlock. In 2003 MPs rejected all permutations of a hybrid, elected, abolished or appointed house - but almost voted by 281 to 284 for an 80% elected upper house - and peers voted against election. This time they would have been forced to reach a decision. But on February 7 Labour MPs made it plain that they were unhappy with the procedural novelty of AV. The Tories and Lib Dems called it an outrage. Each have different motives. A few MPs want no second chamber, some want a mostly elected house, others - mostly Labour - fear that an elected house will challenge their supremacy and prefer appointment. There were also fears of creating a voting precedent. Mr Straw, who is a good listener and a crafty operator, got the message, and told MPs he was dropping the AV idea. MPs will vote next month the same way as they did the last time - though not necessarily with the same result. Straw is more of a pragmatist, more of a fixer than Robin Cook who presided over the \"train crash\" of 2003. Then Tony Blair was anti-elections. Now he's changed his mind because the facts have changed - not least his own problems with appointments to the Lords. When the facts change, change your mind; that is why the pair of them are still in office - just - after 10 years, still trying to complete unfinished business, of which a half-reformed Lords is part. Some 49% of peers were sent their P45s by Mr Blair himself - but they still vote down his bills, as they were doing over mental health reform today. How annoying for him. But don't think a fully reformed Lords will behave any better. Quite the reverse: that's what it's there for. But it won't be Mr Blair's problem - and he won't be part of the problem either. No peerage for Tony."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
