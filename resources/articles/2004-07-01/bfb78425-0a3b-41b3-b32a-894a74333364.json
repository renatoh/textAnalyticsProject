Sharapova had been muscled out of the first set, 6-2 in just 25 minutes, and was 2-1 and a break down in the second when the clouds burst. Yet when she returned her dominance was utter and Davenport faltered in the face of the onslaught. So, had the Russian been talking to her father Yuri, who exerts such control over her career, or her coach, Robert Lansdorp? \"No. I was reading OK magazine, to be accurate.\" The ridiculously nonchalant Sharapova, 17, then made the breezy claim that she had written a sociology essay before the match. It is uncertain what questions she will be asking Serena Williams in tomorrow's final but she is likely to be a tough examiner. She really is something even though, according to the rankings, she is only the sixth best Russian player. Already she has left behind Anna Kournikova, with whom she is so often, and glibly, compared; Kournikova, who now seems to have disappeared, never made it past the semi-finals on these lawns. Sharapova went 3-1 down in that second set when play resumed and broke back to level at 3-3. In the ninth game Davenport had another break point but was unable to take it. Sharapova won the tie-break and the increasingly weary Davenport knew her chance had gone. Sharapova ran away with the third, 6-1. Here was something more than a contest between double-fisted backhands and top-spin forehands. It was also a match between epochs. Sharapova, precociously self-assured and extravagantly talented, is probably the best and certainly the most eye-catching of the new generation, even though her one-dimensional game does not have the textures and shades - the slices and volleys to go with the strong serve and powerful groundstokes - that experience will bring. Davenport, though only 28, came from a time that considered shy introversion a virtue. Her heavy game, though admirable, is essentially dull. It would have looked perfectly at home alongside Margaret Court's in the sepia-toned Wimbledon of four decades ago. The future won. Davenport may have fast hands but they could not disguise the fact that she has the turning circle of an HGV. And after a long career, her operation-scarred knees and shoulders are old beyond their years. This, probably, was her last Wimbledon. \"I can't see myself coming back next year,\" said the champion of 1999. But the essence of the match was that rain interruption. Afterwards Sharapova was more positive. She served better and her second serve, in particular, was more aggressive. Davenport's tired orthodoxy had no answer. \"I had control of the match and she took it from me,\" said the American. \"Every time she came up with the goods, whether it was first serves or break points. She played big shots. \"When we came back from the rain delay she stepped up her game and from that point on was more in control of the match. She started to serve much better and I started to serve a lot worse.\" Sharapova's game can be measured according to her noise emissions. In the first set she blew air out, like petulant sighs. In the second there was much groaning, suggesting a girl having uneasy dreams. In the third she was grunting like Jimmy Connors but this time all the nightmares belonged to Davenport. It is not the first time in these championships that Sharapova has triumphed after a slow start. She is a wonderful scrapper, a retriever of doubtful causes. Her journey here could have belonged to the pages of the Pippi Longstocking series of books she enjoys reading, in which the heroine's father is a pirate on the high seas and her mother an angel in heaven. In her dislocated upbringing - she moved to Florida from Russia when only seven years old - she was without her mother for a long period while her father worked elsewhere as a coach. And maybe she is tougher because of it. Sharapova said afterwards: \"In the first set her serve was just too good. There was not much I could do, even though I felt pretty good. \"I didn't return enough of her serves. But in the second set I slowly started to make her hit that second ball. \"I just hung in there. I kept believing in myself. I was just fighting, especially in the tie-break. I wanted it so bad. It's a shock to be in the final. It's amazing. I don't have any other words. \"All the hard work in my life, all the sacrifices. I never expected this to happen so early in my life. I knew that I could achieve many things if I worked hard and believed in myself. But I never expected to do so well at such an early age.\" Now, everyone else expects her to become a major star."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
