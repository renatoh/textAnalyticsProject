De Bruyne was making only his second start after a three-month layoff because of ligament damage to his right knee. He was forced off after Fulham\u2019s Timothy Fosu-Mensah fell on him. While Brahim D\u00edaz\u2019s first two goals for City secured a trip to Leicester or Southampton, Guardiola admitted his concern over De Bruyne. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s not serious. He\u2019s being checked. I don\u2019t know right now,\u201d said the manager, who added: \u201cI think Kevin is back, no? It\u2019s the Kevin we know. He made a huge effort against Shakhtar Donetsk. He played a few minutes in a difficult situation at Spurs [on Monday]. Today he was involved in the offensive and defensive side.\u201d Guardiola retained only John Stones from the 1-0 win at Tottenham and professed himself pleased with City\u2019s performance. \u201cEverybody was good. Brahim made two goals; Aro Muric gave us good security; Phil Foden plays a good level every time. We made an excellent performance without the ball in terms of how aggressive we were. Fulham have the quality to play even though they are not in a good moment in terms of results. \u201cWe played like the game deserved. We made the space and created enough chances. I\u2019m so satisfied.\u201d D\u00edaz could leave City next summer on a free transfer. \u201cWe want him but it doesn\u2019t depend on us, it is the agent, him, family, they decide,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cMy opinion is not changed because of two goals. The opinion is so high. To compete with Leroy San\u00e9, Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Gabriel Jesus \u2013 it is not easy to find space in the team. He knew that in the beginning and we are delighted with him. He decides. It\u2019s simple.\u201d Slavisa Jokanovic made three changes \u2013 Tom Cairney, Luciano Vietto and Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa came in \u2013 with the Fulham manager desperate for a win after losing the past four games. De Bruyne took only moments to show his class with a shot and followed that with a cross-shot Sergio Rico was grateful to gather. Fulham were wide open and sloppiness appeared to be City\u2019s only enemy. It was too easy. San\u00e9 fed Foden and his fierce shot was beaten away and De Bruyne\u2019s follow-up was deflected for a corner. City\u2019s lead arrived when the ball broke following a corner. It bounced off Vincent Kompany\u2019s left knee and D\u00edaz\u2019s hunger allowed him to beat Fosu-Mensah to the ball and hit home. Next, Danilo skated along the right and was allowed to career into a shooting position. Only Rico\u2019s left post kept out the right-back\u2019s blazing shot. City had Fulham were they love to have all opponents: pinned in and around the area facing constant waves of attack. At this juncture De Bruyne, Danilo, D\u00edaz, and Fabian Delph were a blur of interchanging passing. When Foden laid off a simple ball to San\u00e9 rather than shoot it was a telling illustration of smart decision-making by the 18-year-old midfielder. City, though, did ease off. Passes went astray and the pace sagged. This had Guardiola hanging his head and, for all their dominance, City were only a goal up. They did, though, commence the second half with intent but Aleksandar Mitrovic gave City a scare when he breached the penalty box \u2013 a near collector\u2019s item \u2013 before Foden broke down the left. After swapping passes with Oleksandr Zinchenko he put in Jesus but a player with only one goal in his past 11 appearances showed why, proving unable to at least pose Rico a question. The match was played at an under-capacity Etihad Stadium with a flat atmosphere. City had caught the mood and a passage of prolonged Fulham pressure showed they retained hope. D\u00edaz still sparkled. One moment he was back helping to defend, the next performing a soft-shoe shuffle to create space for a shot. It was the Spaniard who doubled City\u2019s lead. An injection of what had been missing \u2013 speed \u2013 from San\u00e9 led to Foden touching on to Jesus and, after his attempt came off Rico\u2019s left post, D\u00edaz smashed home. San\u00e9 was now back on song: driving at Fulham and causing them headaches. Foden produced a dinked pass that put in San\u00e9 and it began to feel a long way back for Fulham. With 13 minutes left Riyad Mahrez replaced D\u00edaz. The forward received an ovation plus a hug from Guardiola, who brought on the 18-year-old French midfielder Claudio Gomes for his debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
