Joe Hart was booked but impressed on his debut after signing from Manchester City while Basaksehir were unlucky not to get a chance from the spot to take a lead into next Thursday\u2019s second leg after the ball appeared to strike Jeff Hendrick\u2019s arm during the closing stages. Rangers have the upper hand following a 3-1 win over Maribor at Ibrox. Alfredo Morelos struck from close range for the home side in the sixth minute before Mitja Viler brought parity and an away goal; but James Tavernier\u2019s penalty and a late, scruffy Lassana Coulibaly effort ensured Steven Gerrard\u2019s side take a two-goal cushion to Slovenia. Hibernian played out a goalless affair at home to Molde. The Welsh Premier League champions, The New Saints, face a tall order in Denmark after going down 2-0 to Midtjylland while Cork City also need to overturn a 2-0 deficit after losing at Turners Cross to Rosenborg. The Norwegian side entered the Europa League qualifying draw after being knocked out of the Champions League qualifying stages by Celtic last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
