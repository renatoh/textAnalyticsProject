Taylor's deep roots in Bill Evans and a little of Chick Corea's dancing playfulness are more audibly balanced against the harmonies he draws from both classical music and jazz here, though it's still a predominantly reflective programme. Danielsson's lustrous sound and Taylor's unique keyboard touch entwine on the opening Consolation; France turns staccato drum tattoos into a sporadic free-Latin feel on the title track; the leader's Bill Evans romanticism emerges on the ballad Nicolette, and accounts of I Loves You Porgy, an unexpected In the Bleak Midwinter, and Kenny Wheeler's classic Everybody's Song But My Own are masterpieces of spontaneous ensemble composition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
