He did not make his high-school team until his third year. He retired from the NBA nearly as often as he won titles. In 1993 Jordan had an unsuccessful stint in minor league baseball and appeared in the dreadful film Space Jam in 1996. 2 Wilt Chamberlain On 2 March 1962 Chamberlain scored a record 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors against the New York Knicks. But he claimed to be an even more prolific scorer off the hard wood. In 1991 he wrote that he had had sex with 20,000 women. 'At my age, that equals out to having sex with 1.2 women a day, every day since I was 15 years old.' Though Chamberlain came to regret his sexcapades, he would never be ashamed of his 1967 and 1972 NBA titles or scoring a record-breaking 4,029 points in 1962. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1978. 3 Magic Johnson Johnson's mother didn't approve of her son's nickname. She thought it blasphemous that a sports writer dubbed Earvin, 'Magic', after he witnessed the 15-year-old high-school star dominate a game. His mother also would not have approved of her son's promiscuity - sexual activity that Johnson later admitted led to him becoming HIV-positive in 1991. He won five NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers and three NBA MVP honours (1987, '89, '90) and he was a member of the 'Dream Team' that won the Olympic gold medal in 1992. 4 Larry Bird The spotlight initially daunted Bird, born in tiny French Lick, Indiana, but for $650,000 a year (then a record), Bird was willing to enter a major market. The Boston Celtics drafted him in 1979 and he helped rescue the franchise, winning three championships during his 13-year career. Bird always wanted to be 'The Hick from French Lick' and returned to coach the Indiana Pacers in 1997. 5 Bill Russell Russell was a trendsetter. The NCAA created new rules to accommodate his physical play: widening the lane, the area around the basket, to 12ft and instituting 'goaltending', which prevents players from blocking a falling shot. He won more championships (11) than any other player. Russell was his own man. He refused to sign autographs and did not attend his 1975 Hall of Fame induction. 6 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar A man of strong faith, Abdul-Jabbar converted to Islam in 1971 and changed his name from Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar means 'noble powerful servant' in Arabic. The six-time NBA champion and six-time League MVP requested to leave Milwaukee in 1975 so he could be around more people who shared his beliefs. He played with the Los Angeles Lakers until he was 42, practising yoga to keep fit. The center was best known for his sky-hook shot. 7 Oscar Robertson The Big O was fantastic to watch. The giant guard scored 26,710 points in his 14-year career, more than anyone in his position. But more than score, Robertson could assist and rebound with the best. His career assist record (9,887) survived until Magic Johnson surpassed it nearly 20 years later. 8 Julius Erving Erving's 'baseline move' in the 1980 NBA Finals epitomises what the small forward was about. Doctor J drove to the hoop, intending to lay it up. But he did not account for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's arm. Already in the air, Erving's body was heading out of bounds. Adjusting his position, Erving reached around the backboard and scored. Erving, the original one-man highlight reel, patented the powerful Tomahawk slam and was the first to soar all the way from the foul line to the bucket and throw it down. 9 Jerry West Ever seen the NBA logo with the little white man dribbling through the centre? That little white man is Jerry West, the same little white man who played so hard he broke his nose nine times. In the 1970 NBA Finals, the original 'Mr Clutch' had the ball behind mid-court and launched a buzzer-beating shot from 60ft that splashed the net. The Lakers lost that series, but West became the first member of a defeated team to win MVP of the NBA Finals. 10 Shaquille O'Neal His name may mean 'little warrior', in Arabic, but at 7ft 1in and more than 300lb Shaq is hardly petite. The Big Diesel has won four championships including a three in a row with the Los Angeles Lakers, as well as one in 2006 with the Miami Heat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
