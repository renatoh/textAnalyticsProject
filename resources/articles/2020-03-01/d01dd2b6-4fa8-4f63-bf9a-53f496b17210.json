Now, with the coronavirus pandemic causing the Australian government to recommend any gathering of more than 500 people be cancelled, the industry is bracing for the worst, with insiders describing \u201ca growing sense of doom\u201d about what\u2019s to come \u2013 and politicians and industry bodies calling for an \u201curgent\u201d plan to help. From Dark Mofo to Download: what\u2019s happened already Internationally, the threat of coronavirus has led to the cancellation of major tours and festivals including Coachella and Miami Ultra, and the stock of global tour promoter Live Nation plummeting $1.8m in a single day. But it was the nixing of SxSW that sent shockwaves through the Australian music industry. Forty-three Australian artists had been selected from a pool of 7,000 to showcase at Austin, Texas: a rare opportunity to get in front of international managers, bookers and publishers, which can result in major global deals. Industry body Sounds Australia quickly pulled together a showcase livestream for 18 artists, but the cancellation was a substantial hit, and devastating for many. And there have been big gig losses in Australia too: Miley Cyrus\u2019s cancelled trip to Australia spelled the end for a major bushfire relief concert; Robbie Williams is no longer playing tonight in Melbourne; and My Chemical Romance\u2019s decision not to tour saw major emo-punk festival Download cancel in Sydney and Melbourne, just seven days out from the event. All this before the government\u2019s announcement on public gatherings \u2013 and there is no way to predict how long it will last. That was one bet that Mona founder and prolific gambler David Walsh didn\u2019t want to take: he called off Hobart\u2019s Dark Mofo festival on Wednesday, despite the fact that it was scheduled three months away, in June. \u201cA festival-wide last-minute cancellation would run into the millions, and likely end the event permanently,\u201d said festival director Leigh Carmichael. \u201cI know [this] will murder an already massacred tourism, but I feel like I have no choice,\u201d said Walsh. Late on Friday, participants of Melbourne International Comedy Festival (MICF) were told the full festival was being cancelled. With more than 600 Australian and international acts, and more than 7,000 performances programmed, the three-week event was scheduled to begin on 25 March. \u201cWe\u2019re devastated by the news we have to share,\u201d organisers told the participants, before announcing the cancellation. \u201cOur primary concern is the health and welfare of our artists and participants, staff and audiences.\u201d The decision, while sad, was considered the right one by many artists involved: while some MICF events are run by the festival, who carry the risk, the majority are self-produced \u2013 and independent acts had been struggling to decide whether or not to go ahead. \u201cThe way it\u2019s structured makes it hard for small artists to make the call to cancel without anything official happening,\u201d one told the Guardian, \u201cbut people [were] feeling awful about trying to promote in this environment \u2013 not just because of low turnout, but because it [felt] reckless.\u201d As of Friday, the festival had not confirmed whether it would be refunding registration costs, which run from $375-$685, or helping artists recoup other costs such as venue hire and staffing. \u2018The sector could be brought to the brink\u2019 Friday\u2019s announcement recommending the cancellation of mass gatherings presents a major blow to Australia\u2019s live performing arts industry, which contributes more than $2.5bn to the economy, according to industry bodies \u2013 but relies on getting people through the door. Evelyn Richardson, the chief executive of industry body Live Performance Australia, issued a statement on Friday calling for the government to help. \u201c[With a forced] cancellation of live performance events, they need to \u2026 urgently develop a targeted relief package to keep businesses operating,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are companies that will not have the balance sheet strength to withstand the combined impacts of box office failure and contract obligations, and some larger event cancellations may cause irreparable damage.\u201d The Australian Major Performing Arts Group echoed the sentiments in their own Friday statement, with shadow minister for the arts, Tony Burke, weighing in with his: \u201cAustralia\u2019s arts sector was already fragile before the coronavirus crisis due to the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government\u2019s cuts and neglect. Now with live performance ticket sales dropping and the list of cancelled events growing rapidly, the sector could be brought to the brink over coming months.\u201d When \u201cno show means no income\u201d in the performance industry, Burke said, \u201cthe government needs a plan for the arts sector and we need to hear what it is \u2013 urgently\u201d. Arts orgs live in fear of tomorrow At the time of publishing, neither Bluesfest (April), Vivid Sydney (May) or Splendour in the Grass (July) had announced cancellations \u2013 although if the government\u2019s advice on mass gatherings remains in place, and is heeded, they will not be going ahead. Doubt has been thrown on festivals with events that attract smaller crowds, too. Announcing the program of Sydney writers\u2019 festival on Thursday night, director Michaela McGuire added a caveat to the list of names: \u201cThere are inevitable lineup changes every year \u2013 but we are expecting more than most.\u201d By Friday, the festival had suspended ticket sales. \u201cWe are now carefully working through next steps and we\u2019ll be in touch on Monday 16 March with a more detailed response,\u201d CEO Chrissy Sharp said in a statement. Theatre insiders are feeling anxious. Executive director of Theatre Network Australia, Nicole Beyer, told the Guardian, \u201cIf a project is cancelled, the independent artist\u2019s wage is just completely gone. They\u2019re on contract to contract. There\u2019s no fallback. They can\u2019t use leave. \u201cIt\u2019s the smaller companies and independent artists that are going to suffer the most,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t have reserves. They don\u2019t have a way to get through bad times.\u201d Beyer supports the calls for federal stimulus. \u201cWe hope that the government will do the right thing by this industry.\u201d And the screen industry is facing its own risks. Production of Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic on the Gold Coast was halted this week after Tom Hanks was diagnosed with the virus; and according to reports, Marvel movie Shang-Chi \u2013 currently filming at Fox Studios in Sydney with a team of approximately 900 people \u2013 has suspended filming for two weeks, as director Destin Daniel Cretton awaits his test results. Hollywood blockbusters operate in their own economy, but very few Australian arts bodies can take this kind of financial hit. In November it was said that many arts organisations \u2013 particularly smaller, independent groups \u2013 were already at \u201ccrisis point\u201d. Then they spent the summer raising funds for the bushfire emergency. Now, it\u2019s the pandemic. Do they have anything left to give?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
