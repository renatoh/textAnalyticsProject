I blinked, and an avian image displaced this aeronautical one: for it wasn\u2019t an aircraft, but a bird. A Dalmatian pelican (Pelicanus crispus), to be precise: named not because it has a black spotted plumage (it doesn\u2019t), but after the region of south-east Europe from which it hails. Having landed, it floated serenely amongst the gulls and little egrets, which appeared tiny by comparison with this huge and rather ungainly bird. But my children and I weren\u2019t visiting the Danube Delta, but the Camel estuary in north Cornwall. We had parked \u2013 as instructed \u2013 in the Lidl car park, and headed up the Camel Trail. It was half-term, so we were accompanied by a convoy of hired bikes and tandems, carrying people clearly unaccustomed to cycling in a crowd. After trudging along for almost an hour, and with time for lunch long past, we had begun to wish we had rented bikes ourselves. There was no shortage of birds, with flocks of gulls, geese and waders all gathering on the rising tide. But still no sign of the bird we had come to see. Then we bumped into a friendly crowd of birders, who took great pleasure in telling us that the pelican had just flown back the way we had come \u2013 the trees along the riverbank having blocked our view. Retracing our steps, we reached the next viewpoint, when miraculously the bird appeared, cruising into land just 100 metres in front of us. The Dalmatian pelican is the largest flying bird I am ever likely to see in Britain, on average even bigger and heavier than the great bustard or mute swan, and with a wingspan of more than three metres. Indeed, it is a contender for the heaviest flying bird in the world. George gazed through the telescope, and pronounced that it looked like a dirty gull. It did, though when the sun came out its plumage glowed whiter than before, setting off that huge, pinkish-yellow bill. That famous verse \u2013 \u201cA wonderful bird is the pelican, His beak can hold more than his belly can\u201d \u2013 came immediately to mind. Meanwhile passers-by stopped and asked what we were looking at. When told, some walked on without a second glance, clearly doubting our claim, while others tentatively peered through the scope to marvel at this incredible bird. We were all enjoying the sight of the first \u2013 and so far only \u2013 wild pelican to be sighted in Britain in modern times. But they did used to be here: the bones of this species have been discovered on an Iron Age site near Glastonbury, dating back more than 2000 years. So is this pelican a lost bird, or a visionary pioneer, returning to its ancestral home? I like to think it is the latter. Perhaps, not all that far in the future, we may be able to enjoy watching squadrons of these fabulous birds floating high over Glastonbury Tor. For now, though, the pelican is a great example of how a single bird can fire people\u2019s imagination; engaging locals and visitors alike simply by its presence here on this Cornish river, on a fine autumn day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
