In 1870, the Prince of Wales - later King Edward VII - voluntarily appeared as a witness in a divorce case when Lady Mordaunt falsely accused the heir to the throne of being one of her lovers. Again, in June 1891, he appeared as a witness in the Tranby Croft case to testify on a slander accusation arising from a card game. King George V, Edward VII's son, was accused of bigamy by a republican newspaper early in his reign and sued for libel. Although he did not appear in court to give evidence, the king sent a statement making clear that he was innocent of bigamy and was legally married to Queen Mary. More recently, the present Queen's daughter, the princess royal, was summoned to appear before magistrates with her husband, Commodore Timothy Laurence, accused of keeping a dangerous dog which allegedly attacked a couple in Windsor great park. The princess, who in a separate prosecution was fined for speeding, has been ordered to appear at Slough magistrates court on November 21. Viscount Linley, son of the late Princess Margaret and the Queen's nephew, also appeared in court in the late 1980s to face a speeding charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
