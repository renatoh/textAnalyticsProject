Did it really, you are thinking, take you 10 years to reach this conclusion? Yes, I am ashamed to admit it. I was a slow learner\". This passage neatly reflects the whole book: opinionated, superficial, banal, full of unconscious bathos. The image the former chief inspector of schools seeks is as simple-minded as his arguments. He is the fearless warrior battling on behalf of parents and inner-city children abandoned by incompetent teachers. Vilified by the establishment, or the \"Blob\" (a term borrowed from William Bennett), this national treasure - disgusted with Tony Blair's government - retreats to a cottage to pen some \"truths\". Pass the tissues. He sets up easy targets - bureaucracy, incompetence, \"initiatives\" - yet the book is riddled with astonishing paradoxes. Woodhead, a former progressive teacher, became an arch-traditionalist. He worked in local authorities; they should be closed. He was a teacher trainer, so university departments of education must be abolished. Bureaucracy is bad, yet he was head of the very organisations that produced most of it: the National Curriculum Council, The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, and the Office for Standards in Education. The national curriculum should be abandoned: his agencies devised it. Woodhead's route to Damascus must have taken him via Sydney. Contradictions pervade the text. John MacBeath is lambasted for mistaking a name (\"scholarship these days does not require an accurate recall of Christian names\"), but Woodhead, in a Daily Telegraph article, confused his Ofsted successor, Mike Tomlinson, with his ex-colleague Jim Rose. He criticises teachers who cannot keep order and then blame children, yet bleats about pupils he taught 25 years ago: \"These young men and women I can remember so well should not have been in my English lessons. They were uncontrollable\". Who should teach them English, if not their English teacher? A journalist traced two such pupils named by Woodhead in a speech at last year's Conservative party conference, his natural home nowadays. One could not remember him; the other thought he had taught her maths. Some of Woodhead's conclusions are strange. For example: small schools cannot impart understanding to children because they are unable to stream them. And: the biggest professional decision in his life was whether or not to carry on with a performance of Hamlet during a power cut (the lights went out - nothing new there). And on suspect Ofsted reports: \"I let too much be published in my name because I had to respect the professionalism of the individual inspector\". Pass the tissues again, please. The book is very egocentric, laced with \"I\" and \"me\", sometimes 10 times in as many lines. \"Prickly, confrontational, arrogant, incapable of working with anyone,\" he states. \"Yes that's me. But it is what the chief inspector has to be if Ofsted is to maintain any semblance of independence\" - an astonishing piece of post hoc rationalisation. The text is thick with colloquialisms and clich\u00e9s such as traditional English teachers are supposed to discourage: \"These are, in fact, real cake and eat it proposals\"; \"shilly-shallying gets no one anywhere\"; \"warts and all\"; \"till the cows come home\". Short sentences sustain the breathless saloon bar ranting: \"Buckle down, the unions have not\"; \"It is pathetic\"; \"Too often nothing is\"; \"And so on\" (at the start of a paragraph). In this simplistic homily, the reader is Woodhead's chum: \"It may be me. But what about you?\" He inserts \"I joke not\" in brackets. To paraphrase Blackadder, a source surprisingly absent from this populist text, the prose is so trite it could have been written by the Professor of Trite at Oxford University. The best feature of the book is its decent cover. Frequent use of ephemeral terms such as \"recent\", \"last week\", underline the transience of what lies beneath. Pity it wasn't sold ready perforated. What are his solutions? Alas. Chatty cliches. And short sentences. Cannot conceal. His backward looking. Ideas. Thank goodness Woodhead is not running the NHS, otherwise we might all have leeches stuck to our bums. Grammar schools and selection will be reintroduced (I joke not). Everyone has a voucher. Education is run by private profit-making companies. Just like Railtrack. Give the chap a Conservative peerage - Lord Woody of Wonderland. Press reports tell of his efforts to raise millions so he can found a string of private schools, presumably the Woodhead Academies. Having attacked professors of education, he has become one - yet another paradox. The good news is that it is only at the University of Buckingham, a private university given a tiny handful of low grades in the recent Research Assessment Exercise. Phew! Ted Wragg is professor of education at Exeter University."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
