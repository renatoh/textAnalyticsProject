BUT LET'S PUT RIGHTS AND WRONGS ASIDE FOR THE MINUTE: THIS IS A WORKER v MANAGEMENT ISSUE, SO STRIKE, STRIKE, STRIKE! The Fiver isn't much cop at making decisions. Meat or fish? Bitter or lager? Accept \u00a33.41/annum pay increase and tug forelock or sleep in cardboard box under Waterloo Bridge using P45 as quilt? But this Rio Ferdinand affair is even more perplexing: now it's reported that England United weren't so together after all, and that several of the players were at best indifferent to the issue! So who to believe? The testimony of a bunch of clumpish footballers? Or a story in the Lahndan Ev'nnn Stana, owned by Associated Newspapers who (a) don't recognise or negotiate with the NUJ and (b) also publish the Daily Bigot? Decisions, decisions. \"The team meeting was marked by indifference from some of the young players and silence from some of the leading 'rebels',\" trumpets the paper, under the headline See What Happens When The Feckless Working Classes Get Together. (Or was it Sham Of The England Strike?) \"David James stood up at one stage and attempted to analyse the whole issue and one player started giggling. There was no one willing to even suggest that the strike threat was an ill-advised idea,\" it adds, using language the Fiver would never compare to loaded anti-union hackery. This puts the announcement that Michael Owen is definitely ruled out of the game against Turkey in the shade. \"After receiving treatment from our medical staff,\" said FA spokesman Margaret Thatcher, \"it was felt that, despite Michael making excellent progress, he would not be fit for Saturday's game. It is impractical to risk him in a game of this magnitude.\" Aye, right. And we're supposed to believe this? It's clear as day that Red Mike's downed tools! At this rate, he'll become an even bigger working-class hero than Scargill. Or that chippy Scottish bloke down the M62. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Azerbaijan were not that bad at all when we played them, they pulled off a great draw in Serbia and beat them at home, which really helped us. Hopefully there is a little miracle waiting to happen in Italy\" - Cardiff striker Robert Earnshaw dares to think the unthinkable. * * * * * * * * * * * * LEEDS SUSPEND PLAYER Sshh! Yes, we know you know who it is. Shh! But nothing! Shhh! www.dot.shh.dot.com! Ssh! Ssh! Ssh! Rearrange the following words into a sentence: it, zip. Yes, we realise it's all over the front page of the Sun next to a not-at-all-obvious picture of him which has been \"obscured for legal reasons\". Double-page spreads in the Daily Mirror and Daily Bigot, you say? You do surprise us. Look, don't care what you say. This is an alleged serious sexual assault case and we can't reveal his identity, even though every single other newspaper has done so. As has the Beeb. And Sky. And Reuters. And Chapeltown parish magazine. \"Leeds United FC have had a meeting with Jody Morris and his solicitor this morning.\" Oh, and Leeds United FC. Morris has been released on bail pending further enquiries after being held overnight by detectives investigating allegations of a serious sexual assault on a 20-year-old woman. \"In accordance with the standard provisions of the players' contract of employment he has been suspended for up to 14 days to enable the club to conduct an internal investigation,\" a Leeds press officer blabbed today, probably through a loudhailer while waving a cardboard cut-out of a certain former Chelsea footballer. But you didn't hear it from us, right? * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Glenn Hoddle could be about to pay for sins committed during his former job at Spurs by being exiled to Qatar. Apparently he's having talks with an unknown side. Aren't all Qatar sides unknown? Meanwhile loveable-but-not-that-Fab Fabien Barthez could move to Marseille. \"There is no need to think a long time before finding Barthez,\" said Marseille coach Alain Perrin, strangely. Finally, Bixente Lizarazu could move from Bayern Munich to either Bolton Wanderers or Liverpool. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Steve Coppell has ended speculation over his future by jumping ship and joining Reading. \"This is a very ambitious club and I am looking forward to working with the players and staff as we aim for the Premiership,\" Coppell admitted. Wales have given up on Robbie Savage facing Serbia &amp; Montenegro in their Euro 2004 qualifier on Saturday. The Bongo FC midfielder has an Achilles injury and tendinitis. Rangers manager Alex McLeish has been named as Bank of Scotland Manager of the Month for September. And Carlisle have confirmed that Paul Simpson has been appointed full-time manager at Brunton Park. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Five: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (12.05am) Today's Boring Job comes from Michael Brown. Dutch Football (12.45am) Who, given the fact that we're knocking together this section at breakneck speed at the last minute, has helped pad things out by starting his email with this arresting one-liner: \"OK.\" Argentinian Football (2.15am) So thanks for that, Michael. OK. Sky One: Football Years (10.30pm) \"Although Nick Wright's effort is quite impressive, I think I win on the boring stakes,\" begins Michael, not totally getting to the point early doors, but hey, it's helping us out of this hole. Sky Sports 1: England U-20 v Czech Republic U-20 (7.30pm) \"As a tax-dodging student, during the holidays I used to work for an evil recruitment company in Leicester,\" he continues, using two totally superfluous adjectives. Football Countdown (11.30pm) \"As one of the valued members of their fodder, I used to get the better-paid jobs, but there was a price to pay - I ended up working 10.5 hours a day, five days a week in a shop-fitters, sweeping up the dust. Sky Sports 3: Football League Review (12am) \"I reckon I was walking 10-12 miles a day doing that. I would go round the same route all the time, and within 10 minutes there was a layer of dust back where I had just swept. Radio 5 Live: Sport on Five (7pm) \"And then I dropped a bit of timber on my foot without safety boots on. TalkSport: Football First, Second and Third (8pm) \"The level of conversation to be had can be summed up by my mate who also had the same job. Once he came back from work and said: 'They asked me today - who killed Jesus?. And it wasn't from a deep, theological viewpoint.' All for \u00a33.76 an hour (before tax).\" Newstalk 106: Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) That sounds hellish, Michael. We feel your etc., and so on, and so forth.
