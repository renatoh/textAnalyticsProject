At times the evidence was so unbearable that some of them had to leave the courtroom. Only a thin sheet of brown paper separated them from the two men in the dock. On Thursday, when the jury had convicted the defendants after deliberating for 90 minutes at the Old Bailey, the message that Rigby's relatives wanted to send was about the pride they had in the 25-year-old whose memory would live on through his two-year-old son. As the guilty verdict was returned, Rigby's stepfather, Ian, placed a comforting arm around the soldier's sobbing mother, Lyn. In a statement issued outside court afterwards, she said: \"We would like to thank everyone for their overwhelming support. We are satisfied that justice has been served, but unfortunately no amount of justice will ever bring Lee back.\" Rigby's wife, Rebecca, the mother of their son, Jack, said: \"This has been the toughest time of our lives and no one should have to go through what we have been through as a family. These people have taken away my baby's dad but Lee's memory lives on through our son and we will never forget him. I now want to build a future for Jack and make him proud of his dad like we all are.\" The family then eschewed the convention of being whisked away from the court in a vehicle and walked away, to a smattering of applause, melting into the capital's streets where Lee Rigby had the misfortune to encounter two terrorists who murdered him simply because he was a soldier. A drummer in the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, Rigby had wanted very deeply to serve. He was eventually accepted into the army in 2006, after being knocked back three times by a recruitment officer who noticed signs of dyslexia. His first posting was in 2006, to Cyprus. The following year, he deployed to Jordan, where he learned his operational trade as a machine-gunner. He spent much of his first three years in the army performing ceremonial duties at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Tower of London. It wasn't until 2009 that Rigby went off to battle, when he was sent to Afghanistan as a machine-gunner in the Fire Support Group, based in patrol base Woqab in the town of Musa Qala, the most northerly outpost in Helmand province. Seven soldiers from Rigby's battalion were killed during a six-month period. Rigby himself came under fire, according to his best friend, Owein O'Brien. \"We came under attack several times ... Scary for both of us,\" O'Brien told BBC Panorama. \"Like two little schoolboys. Absolutely scared.\" It was after one close shave, when a bullet smashed a picture frame at the side of his bed, that the young soldier telephoned his mother to tell her he loved her and that he missed her. Rigby's family \u2013 mother Lyn, stepfather Ian, sisters Sara, Chelsea, Megan, Courtney and Amy, and wife Rebecca \u2013 were terrified they would lose him in Afghanistan. But he returned home safely. While he was based at Woolwich military barracks in south London, Rigby's family slept easy, knowing their son was away from the battlefield. But he was eager to return to Afghanistan. He made an emotional telephone call to his sister Sara not long before he died, telling her he wanted go back. She talked him out of it. She was not to know what would happen on Wednesday 22 May 2013. On television screens dotted around the courtroom during the trial, family members watched Rigby returning from a day helping out at the Tower of London and making the short journey by foot from Woolwich Arsenal station to the barracks. Dressed in a Help for Heroes jumper with an army day sack slung over his shoulder, Rigby was the first soldier spotted by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. In their Vauxhall Tigra, they lay in wait for a victim. He had no chance. It wasn't until 2am the following day that police officers knocked on Rigby's mother's door in Middleton, Manchester, to break the news that he was dead. By that point the family had run the gamut of emotions \u2013 at first fearing the worst after hearing about the incident and not being able to contact him and then, after so many hours passed and hearing nothing, almost convincing themselves he must be OK. Rigby's mother was going up to bed after finishing an evening shift cleaning when she heard a knock on the door. \"I knew straight away,\" she told ITV News. \"I went to the window and there was four gentlemen in black suits and then I started crying as I knew it was Lee. I went downstairs, I opened the door. That was it ... I fell on to the couch and everything was just a blur from there.\" The delay in telling his parents was, police explained, because they needed simultaneously to contact his wife, Rebecca, from whom he was separated. At some point the news filtered through to Aimee West, Rigby's new girlfriend, who was serving in Afghanistan. \"We just can't understand. You go into shock,\" Ian Rigby told ITV News. \"It just doesn't make sense in your brain. I mean, six months later and it's still so raw. We just have to try to get back to normal. I don't know how you do it, because we are in the same situation where we are still struggling to make sense of it, you know. Something that would give you some peace of mind, I suppose.\" Rigby's four-year-old niece, Ella, was protected from the news for three months, being assured only that her uncle had \"stopped working\". Today Ella knows that Uncle Lee lives \"in the sky\", Sara said. \"I told her normally people don't stop working until they are quite old. But some people are really special and they have to go that little bit sooner. \"To everybody else he was the most selfless person. He would do anything for anybody. He was strong. But he wasn't really.\" The justification given by Adebolajo and Adebowale \u2013 that they were \"soldiers of Allah\" obeying the command of their religion \u2013 is unconscionable to Rigby's loved ones. Ian believes the pair are using religion has an excuse for \"whatever they've been brainwashed with\". The only solace the family \u2013 who have said they never want his killers to be released \u2013 can take from their son's cruel death is that it has brought them closer together. They have been overwhelmed by messages of support from strangers, which continue to pour in. \"It shocked the nation and it made Lee part of everybody's life, not just ours,\" said Ian. \"I mean Lee was taken to everybody's hearts like a son. He became part of everybody's families, everybody felt what we were feeling.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
