The Brazilian government said on Tuesday that it would also deliver humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan border by 23 February at the request of Juan Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition leader. The distribution of the food and medicine from the northern Brazilian city of Boa Vista across the border would be in Venezuelan trucks driven by Venezuelan citizens organized by Guaid\u00f3, Brazil\u2019s presidential spokesman General Otavio Rego Barros said. Guaid\u00f3, who has been recognised by the US and dozens more countries as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president, set a deadline of Saturday for the aid to move across the border, though representatives in C\u00facuta, Caracas and Washington are yet to decide how the aid will cross. Guaid\u00f3 called for caravans of volunteers to carry the aid across at a speech before thousands of supporters in Caracas last week, though it would pit those civilians against the military \u2013 loyal to Maduro \u2013 which is under orders to block the aid. For now, the shipments of aid sit in a warehouse next to the Tienditas bridge, connecting the two countries, which was finished in 2016 but never inaugurated. Although thousands cross the nearby Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge on foot every day, the border has been closed to most vehicles since 2015 following a string of disputes between the two countries. In advance of the first shipment of aid to the border, Maduro had the Tienditas bridge blockaded with containers and an oil tank. The bridge had long been lightly barricaded with a wire fence, aimed at keeping out contraband smugglers. While in part a bid to get much-needed food and medicine to Venezuela\u2019s suffering population, Saturday\u2019s aid mission is also, Guaid\u00f3 and the Trump administration have said, intended to weaken Maduro by forcing the military to disobey their boss and allow the aid on to Venezuelan soil, which could play into Maduro\u2019s narrative that the US is seeking to invade. \u201cYou will find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,\u201d Donald Trump said in a speech in at Florida International University in Miami on Monday before large American and Venezuelan flags. \u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.\u201d Many humanitarian groups have distanced themselves from the aid operation, given its overtly political nature. \u201cHumanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or any other objectives,\u201d UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters in New York last week. The move comes against the backdrop of a propaganda war between Guaid\u00f3 and Maduro, with rival concerts set up in support of each president\u2019s stance over the aid. Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the Virgin Group, threw his clout and cash behind Guaid\u00f3\u2019s efforts earlier this month when he announced a concert in C\u00facuta to raise funds to relieve Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis, and to pressure Maduro to open up his country\u2019s borders. That concert, which will take place on Friday, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of attendees. \u201cVenezuela sadly has not become the utopia that the current administration of Venezuela or the past administration were hoping for, and that has resulted in a lot of people literally dying from lack of medical help,\u201d Branson told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Necker, his private island in the British Virgin Islands, on Monday. \u201cI think it will draw attention to the problem on a global basis.\u201d Maduro\u2019s rival concert will take place on Saturday and Sunday, over the border from the one in Colombia organised by Branson, Venezuela\u2019s information minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez announced on Monday. In an apparent retort to the US aid project, Rodr\u00edguez announced that 20,000 boxes of food aid would be sent to C\u00facuta. Guaid\u00f3 lambasted the move by Maduro\u2019s government to put on a rival concert, calling it \u201cdesperate\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re debating whether the aid should come in or not ... They don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re now making up a concert. How many concerts are they going to stage?\u201d Since 2015, some three million Venezuelans have fled spiralling hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine, with almost 1.5 million staying in Colombia, according to UNHCR. Many refugees and migrants cross at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge, the busiest of Colombia\u2019s border crossings, just outside C\u00facuta. \u201cMaduro says that Venezuela shouldn\u2019t be begging for food,\u201d said Rosa \u00c1lvarez, a Venezuelan migrant from Maracay who was queueing for a meal at a soup kitchen near the bridge. \u201cBut look at what we are having to do right now.\u201d A friend of hers quickly joined in. \u201cPeople are dying in our country,\u201d said Misleidy Casta\u00f1o, from Valencia in northern Venezuela. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in going to any concert, but it if it helps get aid into Venezuela, it can only be a good thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
