The World Cup's top scorer, who has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, now looks set to join Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane at the Champions League winners. \"He does not want to continue at Inter,\" said Alexandre Martins. \"Ronaldo has always respected his contract and wants to continue to do so, but now his psychological condition is different. \"He wants to rediscover happiness and the best conditions to play football. He's looking for the smile that he lost in Milan but can rediscover in Madrid.\" Martins believes Inter's failure to win anything but a solitary Uefa Cup during Ronaldo's five years at the club is his motivation to leave. He suggested that Ronaldo did not want to go anywhere else but Real, adding: \"It's useless to speak of other contacts, just as it is useless to speak of money.\" Real refused to rule out a move for the striker, but were keen to play down any hint of an illegal approach at the weekend. \"We heard that Ronaldo wants to leave Inter,\" said Real's sporting director Jorge Valdano. \"We told them that we would not approach Ronaldo until they made it clear they wanted to let him go. If that happens we would consider a move for him.\" Sources at Lazio suggested last night that they have already been sounded out about selling Hernan Crespo to Inter as Ronaldo's replacement. Inter's president Massimo Moratti has been patient with Ronaldo during 2 years when the player was ravaged by knee injuries, and he will be stunned by the request. Inter lost the scudetto to Juventus on the final day of last season but the prospect of Ronaldo and Christian Vieri remaining fit for an entire campaign has made them favourites for this season's title. Moratti has said that he will wait for Ronaldo to return before giving any credence to the stories. But the player's spokesman in Rio de Janeiro defended Ronaldo. \"Leaving Inter is not an act of ungratefulness,\" said Rodrigo Paiva. \"He's a professional and he must think of his future. It's true that Inter waited for his recuperation but it is also true that he was injured playing for Inter... [the coach Hector] Cuper doesn't really like Brazilians.\" The Argentinian Cuper became frustrated by Ronaldo last season when he went back to Brazil in an attempt toregain full fitness, leaving his club at a critical time. But Cuper denies that he wants to see Ronaldo leave. \"I've never said I don't want to keep Ronaldo,\" said Cuper. \"We have all worked hard in the last year to get him back to playing football and we have built Inter around him. \"Even at 70% he is the best player in the world.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
