They are collections of poetry written by children she taught, published with the help of grants that she tirelessly raised. One, in Arabic, with an English translation, is from a 13-year-old Syrian refugee, a boy with \u201cmessy handwriting and limited vocabulary\u201d (but \u201ca genius\u201d all the same), according to the preface. Another has poems written in English by an 18-year-old Afghan girl who moved to the UK just four years ago. Others are by Somali, Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Polish children. A larger anthology, England: Poems From a School, edited by Clanchy and written by children at Oxford Spires academy, a multi-cultural comprehensive where she taught English and creative writing for 10 years until this summer, was published by Picador last year. Though the poems are sometimes about how migrant children see their new country, the most striking concern fragile memories of their homelands \u2013 \u201cthe sweet honey mangoes they tell me I used to love\u201d, as a Bengali girl writes. Clanchy, 54, is a successful poet in her own right. Although she didn\u2019t write poetry until her mid-20s, her first collection, Slattern, published when she was 30, won several prizes. She has also won prizes for radio plays and short stories. She once said \u201cI don\u2019t want to write novels; I don\u2019t even like novels\u201d, but published one in 2013 (\u201cit started as a short story that had a very long back story\u201d, she explains) and won a Costa Book award. She also won prizes for Antigona and Me, an account of her relationship with her cleaner, a Kosovan refugee. Now she has written a memoir, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, published to rave reviews this year. It is as vivid and honest an account of classroom teaching \u2013 in a depressed Scottish mining town, in suburban Essex, in Oxford \u2013 as you are likely to read. It is a series of sometimes moving, sometimes comic and always engaging stories, some about herself, but mostly about children. Like Callum, the smallest boy in his Scottish class, who, after learning about homosexuality and heterosexuality, announces that, when he grows up, \u201cI\u2019m no\u2019 going to have either of them \u2026 Ah\u2019ll just have a big dog\u201d. Or Allen, an Essex boy with \u201chands the size of dinner plates\u201d studying science A-levels, who was so \u201cphysically affected by poetry\u201d that \u201can image made him flush to his eyebrows\u201d. To his peers\u2019 horror, he recited William Blake\u2019s The Tyger in the local nightclub. Or Shakila from Afghanistan, who remembers how she saw a man wearing too many clothes on a hot day in the market and how she ran away because \u201cI had this feeling, he is wrong\u201d. He exploded a bomb, and a head (perhaps his) appeared on the street. After much struggle, she composes a poem about this experience. At Oxford Spires \u2013 which isn\u2019t anywhere near the celebrated \u201cdreaming spires\u201d \u2013 it hits Clanchy with the force of revelation that migrant children\u2019s dislocated lives and often horrific memories are not \u201cdisadvantages\u201d to \u201ccompensate\u201d for. On the contrary, having to pick up a new language gives them \u201cextra sound awareness\u201d and \u201cthe shock of dislocation \u2026 makes them listen to their inner voice\u201d. And so they did, winning prizes for poetry: Oxford Spires nurtures young poets as Eton nurtures classicists. Clanchy has experience of not belonging, though nothing, she accepts, comparable to what refugee children undergo. She was born in Glasgow and, after her family moved to Edinburgh, went to the city\u2019s George Watson\u2019s College, a fee-charging school. She didn\u2019t fit in, partly because the school was obsessed with sport and she was gawky, bookish and unsporty, partly because she had an English father and, as her peers heard it, an English voice. She went on to read English at Oxford University despite, she claims, being an undiagnosed dyslexic who still can\u2019t spell. There, she felt decidedly Scottish and was amazed by the sense of \u201centitlement\u201d among London barristers\u2019 sons and cabinet ministers\u2019 daughters. That was why she kept entering her pupils for prizes. \u201cI wanted a bit of entitlement for them and to bring it back to the school.\u201d But Clanchy, despite the school\u2019s support, could help children write poetry only as an add-on to the mainstream curriculum. \u201cYou can\u2019t be rewarded at any time in our exam system for writing a poem,\u201d she says. English teaching, she argues, is being strangled by the demands for data on children\u2019s progress. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to mark creative writing, but you can\u2019t easily explain why you\u2019ve done it. You take a delicate, complex creation and then you have to find reductive phrases to describe it. And this idea that different forms of writing require different skills is wrong. I can teach people all they need to know about writing a business letter by writing poetry with them. You need to write well. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d In Some Kids, Clanchy intersperses her tales with the occasional rant (she prefers \u201criff\u201d). She is particularly opinionated on church schools and, while choosing a comprehensive for the eldest of her three sons, visited a Catholic one where she questioned the chaplain about whether he would tell a gay pupil that homosexuality is a mortal sin. He would, he said, but \u201cyou don\u2019t have to choose to send your child here\u201d. She didn\u2019t but, she writes, she has no choice about paying, through taxation, for other children to be taught there. She sent her son instead to Oxford Spires where she was already teaching \u2013 \u201cit only had poor children\u201d. Middle-class parents avoided it but \u201cI invested my child in it\u201d, she says. \u201cHe went with his best friend, also from a middle-class family, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without them. He was very bright, quite swotty, quite shy, played the French horn and the piano. There was a time when I couldn\u2019t go out of the house without somebody asking if he was all right, as though he\u2019d gone green or something. He visibly flourished \u2013 he didn\u2019t just get by, he felt he was loved there \u2013 and now he\u2019s at St John\u2019s College, Oxford.\u201d The school was so diverse, she explains, that \u201cmiddle-class white\u201d was just another odd minority. Others followed and the school is now heavily oversubscribed. Choosing a school, Clanchy says, \u201cis the most political choice we will ever make, far beyond voting\u201d. You could also say that teaching is the most political profession you could enter. In Some Kids, she asks a hijab-wearing Bengali girl and her cousin why they write only about white people and not people like themselves. \u201cMiss,\u201d the girl replies. \u201cWe are not in books.\u201d Thanks to Clanchy, they are now. Poems by Oxford Spires\u2019 pupils A Glass of Tea (after Rumi) by Shukria Rezaei, then aged 15 Last year, I held a glass of tea to the light. This year, I swirl like a tea leaf in the streets of Oxford. Last year, I stared into navy blue sky. This year, I am roaming under colourless clouds. Last year, I watched the dazzling sun dance gracefully. This year, The faint sun moves futurelessly. Migration drove me down this bumpy road, Where I fell and smelt the soil, where I arose and sensed the cloud. Now I am a bird, flying in the breeze, Lost over the alien earth. Don\u2019t stop and ask me questions. Look into my eyes and feel my heart. It is bruised, aching and sore. My eyes are veiled with onion skin. I sit helplessly in an injured nest, Not knowing how to fix it. And my heart, I\u2019d say Is displaced Struggling to find its place. The Doves of Damascus by Ftoun Abou Kerech, then aged 14 I lost my country and everything I, had before. and now I cannot remember for sure the soft snow in my country I cannot remember the feel of damp air in summer. Sometimes I think I remember the smell of jasmine as I walked down the street. And sometimes autumn with its orange and scarlet leaves flying in the high Damascus sky And I am sure I remember my grandmother\u2019s roof-garden, its vines, its sweet red grapes, the mint she grew in crates for tea. I remember the birds, the doves of Damascus. I remember how they scattered. I remember trying to catch them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
