Norton transposes the story from the late 1990s to 1950s Brooklyn, and the result is an atmospheric but try-too-hard noir homage. There\u2019s no arguing with the quality of the craft here: the production design, by Beth Mickle, is vivid and full-blooded; the score, by Daniel Pemberton, is a brassy dive bar grind, all skittish drums and slutty brass. But like the rest of the film \u2013 and particularly Norton\u2019s central performance as Tourette\u2019s-suffering gumshoe Lionel Essrog, who must unpick a web of corruption following the murder of his boss and mentor Frank (Bruce Willis) \u2013 there\u2019s something showy and calculated about the whole thing. Still, it\u2019s worth watching for Alec Baldwin\u2019s bulldozer turn as the power-soured city official who ruins lives for kicks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
