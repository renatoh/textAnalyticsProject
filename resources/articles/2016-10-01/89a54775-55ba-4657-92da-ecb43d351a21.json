They cover the latest mass shooting, they write about congressional inaction, and then they move on. We\u2019re not doing that. Early this year, the Guardian hired me as one of the country\u2019s only full-time gun politics reporters. My job was to help us begin to understand why the gun debate is so broken \u2013 and what it would actually take to fix it. America\u2019s gun violence problem is so much bigger than mass shootings. And the liberal orthodoxies about what might work to prevent gun deaths aren\u2019t always correct. Our reporting this year on guns has been fiercely independent. We\u2019re holding both Democrats and Republicans accountable for what they\u2019re doing to prevent gun violence and suicide. Last month, we published the exclusive results of the most definitive survey of gun ownership in two decades. The central finding \u2013 that only 3% of American adults own half the country\u2019s guns \u2013 is already reshaping the assumptions of the gun debate. This kind of reporting requires investment. When the data sets we need to answer crucial questions don\u2019t exist, we build them. That\u2019s what we did with The Counted, our in-depth database of police killings. That\u2019s what we\u2019re now doing with gun murders in America. We\u2019ve already learned that there are powerful voices for gun violence prevention that simply aren\u2019t getting heard, and solutions that are getting lost in the swift cycles of tragedy, outrage and backlash. Help us keep our focus on how to fix this problem. Support Guardian US by making a contribution or becoming a member.
