Shareholders voted 98.2% in favour, despite voicing substantial fears over corporate governance, regulatory \"overspill\" from the more draconian US market, and potentially huge jumps in boardroom pay. The large vote in favour came after a series of setbacks since Deutsche B\u00f6rse launched its abortive merger offer for Euronext exactly two years ago. Most of the shareholders - including former opponents of the deal such as the US hedge fund Atticus - voted by post or by proxy with only a few dozen investors turning up at the dimly lit hotel ballroom on the outskirts of Amsterdam. The size of the majority surprised even the Euronext board, which had set a target of 90% in favour. But the die was in effect cast when Euronext shareholders saw they would get \u20ac97.43 for each share, compared with the current market price of just over \u20ac90 - itself a record high. NYSE shareholders vote later today but it has yet to win full clearance from US and European regulators, including the Dutch finance minister, Gerrit Zalm. The aim is to complete the merger in the spring of 2007. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Theodore, the Euronext chief executive, who will become deputy to the NYSE's John Thain in the new group, told investors the deal was \"a merger of equals\" and would attract new partners from Asia and Europe. A spokesman for the French investor lobby Proxinvest warned that a switch to a US domicile would gravely damage shareholder democracy but the Euronext chairman, Jan-Michael Hessels, said \"supermajorities\" of 80% would be required to approve serious changes in direction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
