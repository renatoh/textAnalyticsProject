In fact, expect every week to pale in comparison with the last - school league tables, the promise of a revolution in 14-19 learning and the higher education white paper. All it needed was another secretary of state's resignation to cap it. But Charles Clarke shows no sign of an Estelle Morris-style confidence drain. Commentators at a briefing on the package for the universities last week were stunned by his performance. He spoke off the cuff for 40 minutes without hesitation, repetition or deviation - or notes.
