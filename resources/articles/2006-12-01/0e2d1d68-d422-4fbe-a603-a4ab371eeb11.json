English Heritage estimates that only 18% of Catholic churches have listed status - which would entitle them to government repair grants - compared with 80% of Anglican churches. Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: \"In some places our Catholic heritage is hanging by a thread.\" Stephen Bates Chip shops are small business bestsellers In spite of fish stock warnings and potato harvest problems, the traditional chippy has triumphed in a survey of the type of small business British entrepreneurs most want to buy. Heady attractions such as computer software failed to dent the appeal of the micro local food outlet. Fish and chip shops topped the number of business premises traded last year, according to SBS Commercial data on all transactions. Sandwich shops and restaurants came next, followed by empty premises for a range of uses, care homes, nurseries, guesthouses and convenience stores. Martin Wainwright Rolling Stones artwork sells for \u00a3250,000 The original Rolling Stones tongue artwork has sold for \u00a3250,000 at auction. The work was one of 160 lots to go under the hammer at the It's More Than Rock 'n' Roll auction. A spokeswoman for promoter Magnum Communications said the band's guitarist Ronnie Wood and former bass player, Bill Wyman, watched the sale at the Sound in Leicester Square, London. A Fender Stratocaster guitar owned by Jimi Hendrix went for \u00a360,000 and a black bustier worn by Madonna on her Who's That Girl tour sold for \u00a35,000. The auction fetched \u00a3860,000, some of which goes to Cancer Research UK. Press Association Wars of independence top Scottish history poll The wars of independence between Scotland and England in the 13th and 14th centuries have topped a BBC poll to find the most significant events in Scottish history. The poll, broadcast last night by BBC Scotland to mark St Andrew's day, mirrors a surge in opinion poll support for the Scottish National party. The Act of Union between England and Scotland 300 years ago failed to make the top 10. Historian Tom Devine said: \"There's a political dimension here that the current revival of nationalism seems to have something to do with. There's a growing sense of a more confident Scottish identity.\" BBC Tea 'helps cancer patients after radiation therapy' Tea could help cancer patients recover from the after-effects of radiation treatments, research published yesterday suggests. A study by scientists from California and Germany found that tea extracts could help skin damage from the treatments heal faster. The paper, published in the journal BMC Medicine, also charts evidence that tea reduces inflammation. Scientists at the University of California in Los Angeles and the University of Freiburg in Germany found that green and black tea extracts helped radiation-induced skin damage to heal up to 10 days sooner than normal. Press Association Terror suspects lose fight against extradition to US Two terrorist suspects yesterday lost their high court battle in London to avoid extradition to the US. Claims by lawyers for Haroon Rashid Aswat and Babar Ahmad that there was \"a real risk\" that the men would be mistreated, or tried and sentenced as enemy combatants, if they were sent to America were dismissed. Mr Ahmad, from Tooting, south London, is accused of running websites inciting murder and urging Muslims to fight a holy war and to raise money for the Taliban. Mr Aswat faces trial on charges of plotting to set up a camp in Oregon to train fighters for Afghanistan. Press Association Cot death study 'was flawed by alterations' A study that led to the disgrace of paediatrician Sir Roy Meadow, who claimed the chances of a second cot death in one family were one in 73m, and which helped free two women jailed for killing their babies, was fatally flawed, says a British Medical Journal paper. Its results were altered after the death of John Emery, who set it up, the paper says. The BMJ finds the study's authors last year classifed every death which followed an older sibling's cot death and for which there was no strong evidence of killing as natural. This cut the level of unnatural deaths from an initial 40% to 13%. Sarah Boseley"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
