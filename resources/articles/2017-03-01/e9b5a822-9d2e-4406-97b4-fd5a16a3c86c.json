It is doubtful the Northern Irishman has either watched Dad\u2019s Army or would be of a mind to admit it. Nonetheless the world No3 did not leave Austin \u2013 a strange week in Austin \u2013 without issuing firm sentiment. \u201cDon\u2019t panic\u201d was the McIlroy cry in relation to whether his Masters preparations might have been fatally undermined by a lack of golf. McIlroy\u2019s halved match with Emiliano Grillo on Friday at the WGC Match Play was immaterial other than providing 18 holes of golf and, of course, to those in possession of betting slips. McIlroy has played only 14 rounds of a competitive nature this year and labelling the latest one as such is a push, on account both of a rib injury and of early exit from this event. Circumstances in Texas were dictated to a large extent by the withdrawal of Gary Woodland, even if McIlroy had already suffered defeat by Soren Kjeldsen. McIlroy\u2019s body language rarely disguises his feelings. If he is worried about teeing up at Augusta National on Thursday week while undercooked, the 27-year-old did an expert job of masking such emotion. McIlroy will resist what did not even appear like mild temptation to add next week\u2019s Shell Houston Open to his schedule. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve played this year, I\u2019ve played well,\u201d he said. \u201cI did OK in Mexico. I did pretty well at Bay Hill, I had a chance to win. I think I was seven under for the two rounds I played here this week. I played pretty well. \u201cSpeaking to Sergio Garc\u00eda after the first day, if I had played Sergio I would have beat him 6&amp;5 whereas Soren beat me 2&amp;1. So it is what it is. It\u2019s one of those things. Match play can be strange. \u201cThe injury hasn\u2019t been ideal to start the year but I\u2019ve played Houston before and I never felt like it did anything for me. I added it late before, I added San Antonio late before. It didn\u2019t really help me the following week. So I\u2019d rather go up to Augusta, play a couple of quiet practice rounds and then prepare at home.\u201d McIlroy will travel to Augusta on Sunday, before taking to the iconic venue on Monday and Tuesday. By his own acknowledgment, should McIlroy complete a career grand slam of majors this time it will have been with the most unorthodox of backdrops. \u201cEven if it does work this year, I won\u2019t be trying to emulate it in the next few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. Again it\u2019s giving me a chance to prepare a little bit better. I feel like I\u2019ve worked a lot on my short game. If anything I feel like that part of my game is as sharp as it has been ever going into Augusta, so that\u2019s a good thing. But it\u2019s been a bit of a strange buildup. \u201cSince coming back from the injury I\u2019ve played 10 competitive rounds. Right now I can\u2019t see a downside to not having played as much as I planned to. I feel really healthy. I don\u2019t feel any issue with my health. And freshness could help, especially mentally. Mentally going in there and not being drained is a good thing as well.\u201d McIlroy was pragmatic regarding the Austin scenario. \u201cWhen you lose a match here, if you then get through, you are lucky. You still have to win your matches. You have to beat the guy in front of you. I didn\u2019t do that this week and that\u2019s why I\u2019m heading home.\u201d Jordan Spieth\u2019s hopes of victory in his native Texas were ended by the claiming of only a half point from Ryan Moore. Hideto Tanihara was the man to progress from Spieth\u2019s group. Of those who did remain for the Match Play weekend, few can be in better spirits than Jon Rahm. This rising star of the PGA Tour hammered his fellow Spaniard, Garc\u00eda, 6&amp;4 on Friday. Tyrrell Hatton, a player prone to episodes involving red mist, was probably worth avoiding after falling foul of rules officials when involved in a sudden-death play-off for the last 16. The Englishman accidentally clipped his ball with his putter on the 1st green. He was duly eliminated after incurring a two\u2011stroke penalty. \u201cI just hit the back of the ball and knocked it forward barely a centimetre,\u201d Hatton said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the worst way it could have ended.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
