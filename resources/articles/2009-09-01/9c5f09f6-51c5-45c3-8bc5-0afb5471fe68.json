The John Gosden-trained filly, owned by Lord and Lady Lloyd-Webber, had dented the reputation of leading French filly Stacelita in the traditional trial for the Arc de Triomphe in three weeks' time when getting up in the final strides . Previously unbeaten, Stacelita was certainly given every chance of maintaining that record when the pacemaker Volver - who had set only reasonable fractions from the front, rather than the expected fast pace - stepped aside from the rail halfway up the home straight and let her stablemate through. Jimmy Fortune was wise to the plan and switched Dar Re Mi to the inside rail in order to take advantage of the same artificially created gap. However, in the process of making the manoeuvre, Fortune's mount hampered the German runner Soberania and after lengthy deliberations, Dar Re Mi was demoted to fifth place with Soberania promoted to fourth. Dar Re Mi's demotion seemed to take everyone, bar the stewards, by surprise. Darley Stud had already emailed out a press release promoting her sire, Singspiel, by the time the outcome was known. Although an enquiry was called quickly after the race, most presumed that the officials were investigating the antics of the pacemaker and the eventual winner. Indeed, it seemed reasonable to suggest that Fortune would not have been forced into switching inside but for the manoeuvre of the pacemaker. There is no question that, under British rules which focus more upon whether the interference affected the final result, Dar Re Mi would have kept the race. However, the French rules on interference have always been much stricter, even if they do seem to be interpreted more indiscriminately. In the immediate aftermath of the Vermeille, Lady Lloyd-Webber seemed clear that Dar Re Mi would be a likely runner in the Arc. \"It's the biggest race in Europe,\" she said. Thirty minutes later, she was less so favourably disposed to returning. Asked about the possibility of launching an appeal, she said: \"There is an appeals process. But this is France.\" Gosden, en route to Keeneland for the sales, will no doubt have his own eloquent appraisal of the situation to give in the coming days, but the lukewarm reaction of the crowd to the presentation ceremony told its own story. On a day when Sea The Stars hardened as favourite for the big race without having to leave his stable, the other main talking point at Longchamp concerned the ride given to Vision d'Etat, who took the eye as he finished fast for second place in the Prix Foy without Olivier Peslier having ever seemed to ask his mount for everything in the closing stages. The race went to Spanish Moon, currently banned from competing in Britain after previous misbehaviour in the starting stalls, who made all under Ryan Moore and recorded the fastest time of three trials. The Prix Niel, the race with by far the best recent record of the trio of trial races, went to the Andre Fabre-trained Cavalryman, who will be Frankie Dettori's Arc ride. He was workmanlike in success over Beheshtam, but Dettori said: \"He was a bit lazy today, but he will come on for this and if anyone can get them revved up for the Arc, it is Andre.\" Cavalryman's Arc odds were cut to 7-1 from 12-1 by Coral, who lengthened Stacelita to 10-1 from 5-1 and cut Spanish Moon to 16-1 from 33-1. Sea The Stars is now the 6-4 favourite, although he is available at considerably longer odds on the Betfair betting exchange, reflecting fears that the weather could ultimately prevent his participation in the race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
