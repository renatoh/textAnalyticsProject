Now it\u2019s just us: me, Dilyn, Dom, between episodes, and darling Bozzie, though what with my campaigning and his commitments we hardly meet! Last night I woke up aching to discuss marine conservation matters to find this note on his pillow: SORRY OTTIE WARGAMING NEIL IN UNDERGROUND BUNKER, BACK C3 DAYS, YR B. I said but Dom, this is your handwriting, where is Bozzie, really? Dom (looming out of the darkness): \u201cWhat if I said, hiding from Andrew Neil?\u201d Me: \u201cLiar, my Bozzie is brave and strong!\u201d Tried Bozzie later, whoever answered sounded weirdly Chinese. Called Stanley, he said the great unwashed often sound foreign, especially up north. Me: \u201cBut Stanley I need your help, where is Bozzie, I have something so special to tell him.\u201d Stanley: \u201cOh gawd, or lor, already, not THAT dear girl, please \u2013 do not think me unsympathetic to the stirrings kindled by a mature alpha Johnson, dear me no \u2013 but I believe my son the PM is not, shall we say, undeserving of the discreeter sort of outcome.\u201d Me: \u201cStanley! I just want Bozzie to be the first to hear that Dilyn has learned to do his business on Lib Dem doorsteps, so cute!\u201d Stanley: \u201cAnd Labour ones? That is what my son the PM \u2013 not that I am familiar with his location \u2013 will want to know.\u201d Me: \u201cActually \u2013 \u201d Stanley: \u201cWell, if you would get a rescue dog, no don\u2019t cry, now this will make you laugh, did I ever tell you about our Dartmoor neighbours \u2013 accidentally reared a Labour dog \u2013 but it\u2019s a long story, why don\u2019t I tootle over?\u201d Me (screaming): \u201cStanley, wait \u2013 I do have something to tell you.\u201d Silence. Me: \u201cI can\u2019t spell Pinokkio.\u201d Result. As told to Catherine Bennett"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
