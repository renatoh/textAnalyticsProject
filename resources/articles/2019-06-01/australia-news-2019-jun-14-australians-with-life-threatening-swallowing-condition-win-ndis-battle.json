Experts and advocates have described the decision as a \u201cwatershed\u201d, arguing the agency would now be forced to fund swallowing supports, which are vital for people living with dysphagia. That would end a long-running battle in which the NDIA claimed the supports should be offered by the states. But the ruling may also have broader implications for people with disabilities, and for the agency\u2019s finances, as it threatens to overhaul what is considered state and NDIS responsibilities, experts said. \u201cThis judgement has the potential to drastically change what the NDIS funds,\u201d said Sara Gingold of Disability Services Consulting. \u201cIt will impact the way the scheme interacts with all other areas of government, from education to health to justice and everything in between.\u201d While it is unclear exactly how many people might be impacted by the decision, there are about 100,000 people who have dysphagia throughout Australia. People would need to be aware of the ruling in order to make use of it in dealings with the NDIA, advocates argued. In a rebuke to the NDIA, the AAT deputy president, Brian Rayment, ruled the agency was wrong to deny funding to a 34-year-old man who had dysphagia as a result of cerebral palsy. The plan created by his dietician would have costed $40 a day but the agency argued that thickening fluids requested by a speech pathologist \u2013 which helped the man swallow safely and \u201cgave him independence and confidence\u201d \u2013 were health-related, not a disability support. The tribunal has previously accepted the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law \u2013 that it did not need to fund supports considered the responsibility of another government service provider. \u201cWhether or not the other government agency actually provided that support was considered largely irrelevant,\u201d Gingold told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut in this watershed judgment, [the deputy president] \u2026 said that in the past the tribunal and the NDIA have both misinterpreted that section of the legislation.\u201d A win for advocates Darren O\u2019Donovan, an administrative law expert at La Trobe University, said the decision was a \u201cpowerful vindication of those advocates fought such a long battle to correct agency policy in this area\u201d. \u201cSwallowing and dietary support is an integral part of people\u2019s social and family lives,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is not just preventing a person from choking (or other medical events), it enables the person to step out confidently into the world.\u201d Piers Gooding, a disability law expert at Melbourne University, said the issue had not been \u201cexamined in the Federal Court so this decision sets an important precedent\u201d. He noted about 34,000 people had cerebral palsy in Australia. While the prevalence of dysphagia among them varied, it was substantial. Gingold put the number of people impacted by the decision \u201cin the thousands\u201d. The NDIA could appeal the decision to the federal court but that risked setting a more significant precedent. A NDIA spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Agency is considering the recent decision in [the applicant] and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).\u201d Late last year, Guardian Australia reported the case of Tanisha Flemming, who had been denied funding as the NDIA and states argued over who should pay for the supports. In January, the federal government said it would fund some supports for people with dysphagia as an interim measure, following a campaign by the Council for Intellectual Disability. \u201cThis ruling should effectively make the interim funding agreement on swallowing therapies permanent,\u201d said Justine O\u2019Neill, the CID chief executive. \u201cIt is a positive development for many other NDIS participants who need ongoing health related therapies to be funded by the NDIS to enable them to maintain social interaction, quality of life and independence.\u201d O\u2019Donovan said the judgment underlined the need for \u201cfederal and state politicians to commit to clearer rules and improved governance for the scheme\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2019 to note that it is speech pathologists (and not dieticians) who recommend thickeners for people with dysphagia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
