His painting uses a classic strategy of the traditional portrait artist when dealing with a sitter's disfigurement. In paintings by Goya or Ghirlandaio people defiantly sport a physical blemish. Blair sports his horrific political blemish. The none too subtle clue is the poppy, whose glaring redness sets an otherwise ordinary painting painfully alight. Yeo heightens its effect by setting it against the pale blue suit. The poppy blazes - accusingly? It certainly means something that a man loathed by many for taking Britain to war poses wearing the symbol of military remembrance. It's remotely possible that Yeo noticed Blair was wearing it, portrayed him like that, and Blair was none the wiser that it would add an uneasy note to the portrait. More likely, Blair is a tacit co-conspirator who walked in wearing the poppy, then sat as bleak as he looks here, in invitation to the artist to home in on that tell-tale paper flower. If this is the first hint of Blair's long-term campaign for Nixon-like rehabilitation, it is clever. Or is it - could it be - a confession of genuine pain and remorse? Perhaps one day Tony Blair will find the words to match this image. \u00b7 Jonathan Jones is a visual arts critic for the Guardian"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
