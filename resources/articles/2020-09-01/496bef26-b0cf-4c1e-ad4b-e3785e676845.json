The West Ham board faced unrest from supporters after allowing Diangana to leave for \u00a318m and tensions were further inflamed when Noble tweeted that he was \u201cangry and sad\u201d about the decision to sell the 22-year-old. Yet Moyes, who needed to raise funds for new signings through sales, said the captain had a right to express himself and insisted that his players were not in revolt as they prepare for Saturday evening\u2019s home game against Newcastle. \u201cI think they showed real true solidarity,\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager said. \u201cI think the captain showed exactly what the players feel. There is a real building spirit here. Football players move on at any club and things change at every club. \u201cI can tell you what it felt like when I lost Wayne Rooney at 18 when I was at Everton. Did we feel bad at that time? Yes, but we were building a team that finished in Europe the majority of seasons after that. The players since we\u2019ve come back have been in great spirit. That\u2019s partly due to the way they finished the season. \u201cIf we want open communication, people should be allowed to speak. Grady was part of the group. Mark Noble had probably seen him develop as a young player. He was entitled to give his opinion. We know what Mark means to the club and what he thinks of the club.\u201d Moyes wants defensive reinforcements and West Ham are weighing up whether to raise their latest offer of \u00a330m for Burnley\u2019s James Tarkowski. They would not be able to meet Burnley\u2019s asking price of \u00a350m for the defender. However, West Ham have promised that the money received for Diangana will be invested in the squad and Moyes sounded pragmatic about the situation, pointing to the impact of Covid-19 on finances. \u201cI was disappointed to see him go but I understand the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many ways we might have spent a lot of our summer budget in January to keep us up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
