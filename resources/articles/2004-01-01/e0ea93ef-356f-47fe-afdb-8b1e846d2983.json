Their 2-0 win over Aston Villa yesterday carried the imprimatur of Mark Halsey, who had to give his authority far more of a work-out than a sensible referee would wish. He was so crucial to each goal that he functioned almost as a playmaker but, despite the disparagement from most of the crowd, the arbiter will feel no chagrin. While the decision that gave the visitors the lead was a bold one, the ruling that led to the penalty and clinched the result might be regarded as headstrong. After 52 minutes Nwankwo Kanu jinked away from JLloyd Samuel and Ronny Johnsen before barging his way into the area and smacking into Olof Mellberg, who had inadvertently played the Nigerian on-side at the start of the move. There were contrasting interpretations open to the Lancashire referee. He could have regarded the collision as a simple accident that called for no action. The referee, however, concluded that a crude body-check by the Villa captain had occurred. The splendid Thierry Henry was just as emphatic in converting the penalty as Halsey had been in granting it. The incident had been enigmatic and there must have been a temptation to treat it with ambivalence but he was in no mood for diplomacy. The Holte End began the chant of \"2-0 to the referee\". Halsey will take that as proof that he had squared up to his duty. It was easy to feel empathy for him at the first goal. Mellberg, who is usually so efficient a centre-back, was vague with a clearance that let Patrick Vieira come bursting forward. The Swede and Johnsen combined to leave the Arsenal captain sprawling on the ground at the edge of the penalty area. Villa were still musing over their arrangements to defend the free-kick when Henry asked the official if he could take it. Halsey nodded his consent and the forward stroked the ball into the right corner of the net with Thomas Sorensen at the left post. Villa, for an instant, were disconcerted but then launched themselves into the indignation and resentment that brought Mark Delaney a booking. The dispute over this issue was as heartfelt as it was futile. David O'Leary, the Villa manager, reported that his players had been told to retreat the full 10 yards and wait for the whistle, but the referee's recollections differed: \"I gave the option to Thierry Henry: 'Do you want to take it quickly or do you want the wall 10 yards?'\" he reported. \"His reply was 'a quick free-kick'. \"I stood back and made a quick signal for him to go on and take it - I didn't say to the Aston Villa players 'move back 10 yards'. I can understand their frustration at conceding a goal that way but I'm under no obligation to inform the Aston Villa players that Henry is going to take a quick free-kick. You are under no obligation to give a whistle for any free-kick.\" The scorer preferred to be succinct: \"It's happened against us before, so I tried my luck today,\" said Henry. He was thinking of Ian Harte's similar goal for Leeds United at Highbury in 2001 when O'Leary was in charge of the Yorkshire club. \"That happened a long time ago on a very emotional night and I can't remember the ins and outs of it,\" the Villa manager said with prudent vagueness. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, a victor still relishing Manchester United's defeat at Wolves the day before, could indulge in tact over the free-kick goal. \"In fairness,\" he said, \"the rule maybe is unclear.\" That was as far as the concord went, with the managers in complete disagreement over the penalty. It is impossible to dispute, however, that the reactions of a referee had separated the teams. While Arsenal had moments of higher refinement, chances were evenly distributed on an afternoon where the game eventually faded away into inconsequence. Villa, in the 21st minute, might have broken the deadlock and strode towards a fifth consecutive Premiership win at home. Delaney's long pass behind Pascal Cygan was delightful but Juan Pablo Angel's touch proved too heavy as he lifted the ball over both the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann and the crossbar. Four minutes later the Colombian was picked out smartly by Gareth Barry and sent in a low cross that Marcus Allback fired narrowly wide. Nonetheless Arsenal were increasingly composed even if there was little of the searing counter-attacking that can devastate opponents. Individualism produced sporadic pleasures of its own. When Samuel headed out in the 14th minute, Robert Pires, seeing Sorensen off his line, struck a venomous, dipping volley from 25 yards that demanded a fine save by the goalkeeper, who tipped the ball over the bar. No one, though, made as great an impact as Halsey. He will be loathed at this stadium for years to come but outsiders may be pleased that the only \"bias\" he showed at the key incidents lay in favouring a team striving to score."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
