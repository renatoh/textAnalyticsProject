Surrey started the game in the relegation zone and it did not look a false position as they slumped from 98 for one to 126 for six on a blameless pitch. Scott Newman and Rikki Clarke were both out hooking at Lance Klusener before Hutchison accounted for Ali Brown, Adam Hollioake and James Benning with a potent left-arm combination of swing and seam. But Ramprakash held firm against his old county - though Klusener had him caught at second slip off a no-ball - and found increasingly durable allies in Martin Bicknell, Ian Salisbury and Murtagh. Murtagh, a 22-year-old seamer playing only because of a back injury to Azhar Mahmood, announced himself with a couple of stylish back-foot punches through the covers that suggested a better-than-average No10. But it was after Ramprakash's dismissal, slapping Nantie Hayward loosely to backward point after grafting more than four hours for 89, that Murtagh came into his own, in a last-wicket stand of 106 with James Ormond. It was then, also, that Middlesex blew their tops on a stifling Kennington day, with Sven Koenig furious when the umpire George Sharp denied his claim to have caught Murtagh at long off, ruling that he had crossed the boundary rope and raising his hands three times to signal the six. The Surrey members sitting behind Koenig voiced their disapproval, but worse was to follow as Hayward, another of Middlesex's South Africans, appeared to join David Nash in appealing for a stumping against Ormond when he had strolled down the pitch to chat with Murtagh at the end of the next over. Now the other umpire, Jeff Evans, had words with Nash, Hayward and Owais Shah, who had assumed the Middlesex captaincy because of Andrew Strauss's call to Lord's. The mood of Hayward, a red head not renowned for keeping his cool, darkened further when Murtagh slashed him through the covers and watched the next ball fly past the helpless Nash for four wides. He stomped off with a bad foot, and Murtagh cavorted on to an unbeaten 74, his first half-century for Surrey but surely not his last."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
