The world may be about to end in a hundred different ways, but in the rarefied world of top-level football people just keep on showing up asking where the party is. A report by Deloitte has revealed that combined annual Premiership wages are about to break the \u00a31bn barrier. Yes, a thousand millions: enough to buy every house in Middlesbrough twice. Footballers' wages are now a powerful macro-economic force in their own right . So where, exactly, is the Premiership billion going to end up being spent? White leather furniture Football's hunger for white leather home furnishings has reached insatiable levels. This applies across the board. A second-string full-back at a mid-table Premiership club might be happy with just a white leather bed, dual white leather pouffes and a vast, billowing white leather corner sofa. Gareth Southgate, on the other hand, is revered within the game for his priceless Louis Quinze white leather escritoire, at which he works late into the night penning his programme notes, nodding sagely over his white leather pince nez and frequently using words such as \"jejune\", \"aceto balsamico\" and \"tremendous\". Really big headphones Spending on development of newer and ever-larger iPod headphones has tripled in the last year. Premiership insiders have predicted that rocketing circumferences could reach crisis point next season. \"It started off as a bit of fun,\" says a source. \"Everyone wanted to be seen wandering off the team bus with the most pointlessly huge set of headphones. But where will it all end? Do we really want to see a moodylooking Carlton Cole signing autographs with what appears to be a pair of overturned Citro\u00ebn 2CV's strapped to his ears? Wait up. This is a banging tune.\" American OAP cars Expect no let-up in purchases of the kind of cars usually driven by retired middle-American cutlery salesman in pastel shorts and string-backed driving gloves. This is not without its side effects. There have already been protests in Florida at a state-wide shortage of leather-upholstered Lincoln Navigator SUVs. Only last month a delegation from the Gulf Coast Sunshine Apartments Retirement Complex flew to London to demonstrate against \"acts of automotive imperialism\". Sidetracked by a discount group tour bus booking, they were last seen walking very slowly around Westminster Abbey saying \"You got all this history, you still can't get a proper cup of coffee - where's the sense in that? Moira? Moira? Honey?\" Looking mint Estimates suggest that combined spending in out-of-town spa and beauty facilities by friends and relatives of Premiership footballers will soon be sufficient to exfoliate and lightly bronze the entire third world. Which might not be such a bad idea. They need our help now. Not to mention a proper manicure. R'n'B stockpile In the last decade top-flight players have accumulated huge reserves of R'n'B and soul music. With its devastating arsenal of phat beats, phtshss-umphtshss-um sounds and men making groaning noises, the Premiership was ranked alongside China, the NBA and the combined might of south London delivery van drivers in a UN report into global proliferation of irritating music. A spokesman remained defiant: \"We reserve our right to acquire these entirely legitimate materials. Check it, Check it, Check it out. Uh oh uh oh, got my grind on, yeah.\" Large charitable donations Oops. That's a typo. It should say \"Getting millions of parking tickets and owning 13 mobile phones\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
