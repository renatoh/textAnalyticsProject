More than 500,000 Child Trust Funds have been opened since the \u00a3250 vouchers were sent out to parents earlier this year, and the government is already proclaiming the scheme a huge success. However, there are still 1.2 million cheques sitting in drawers or gathering dust on people's mantles. That amounts to \u00a3300m which is losing its infant owners interest or capital growth every day. We interviewed mothers attending government-funded Sure Start play centres and Salvation Army-run playgroups in the London borough of Hackney to examine take-up in one of the most deprived areas of the country. The results of our survey were both encouraging and worrying. Just under 30% of mothers had already invested their CTF vouchers - close to the national average and almost all the remainder were planning to do so soon. The good news is that 40% of mothers who hadn't previously saved for their children said they would now try and save something, with the others saying money was too tight to spare. Only one woman said she couldn't see the point of saving for children. Among those who had already opened accounts, stakeholder schemes (investing in stockmarket-based funds) were the most popular, outnumbering deposit accounts by four to one. However, these mothers tended to be the more financially well-off or admitted their partners had opened the accounts A great many of those who hadn't yet invested were uncertain of the different kinds of schemes available to them and had been put off by long waiting times when they had asked for advice at their local banks. One mother was told by her local branch of the Halifax to come back in three months. More disturbing, given the long-term nature of the CTF, was these mothers' insistence that they would rather leave the money on deposit in a bank than invest in shares. Stock market investments were described as too risky and likened to gambling. Mothers also felt their own lack of knowledge excluded them from investing in shares. David White, chief executive of the Children's Mutual Fund , which has already opened 100,000 CTF accounts, described our findings as \"very worrying\". He said: \"For money that is going to be saved over 18 years, a diversified approach is crucial. There is an inflation risk of leaving your money on deposit in the bank that is being ignored. \"People should remember that over the long-term stock markets are likely to out-perform cash-based savings.\" Figures from the Investment Management Association (whose job, admittedly, is to beat the drum for share ownership) show how much unit-trust funds have outperformed building society accounts, even taking into account the stockmarket falls of 2000-2003. If one invested \u00a3250, plus saving an extra \u00a3100 a month, the building society account would, after 18 years, have grown to \u00a327,915. But the same sum put into a typical \"UK All Companies\" fund would have produced \u00a341,654. But remember that past performance is not always the best guide to what will happen in the future. The government has designed the stakeholder schemes to reduce risk by investing across a wide range of shares or tracker funds. Once a child reaches 13, the account will gradually be switched into cash, or low risk assets to protect their investment. However, several of the mums we spoke to, like Jennifer Herry, mother of 22-month old Curtis, were clearly uneasy about the long-term security of child trust funds and mentioned the pensions crisis as a reason for not opening a shares-based scheme. \"I'm really sceptical about it. I'm worried something might happen to the Child Trust Funds - like pensions. What if they all crashed? I don't really trust the government,\" said Ms Herry. Others felt they didn't know enough to invest in shares. Edwina Durbridge has opened a deposit account with Britannia for her son Levi, 18-months-old. She said: \"I don't know anything about shares and I didn't think I was qualified to gamble with the money.\" Hackney mothers' lack of confidence in shares is reflected nationally. Of Abbey's 77,000 CTF accounts, two-thirds are in cash. While a few mothers blamed laziness - or tiredness - for not opening an account yet, a significant number had found it difficult to get any clear advice. Although the government has brought on board more than 70 CTF providers and signed up additional distributors including high street names like Boots and Mothercare, it seems that many of the staff have had little training or information about the CTF. Hadra Hassen was turned away twice from her local Abbey because they did not have anyone there who could open a CTF account for her son Ayman. Mother of three Alix Edwards was told there was a three-month waiting list to talk to a manager at the Halifax about CTFs. The government says it is trying to educate people about their choices with the Treasury forging close links with agencies like Sure Start and voluntary organisations such as Citizens Advice. But so far, no one at Hackney Sure Start could recall any government help with financial education. There is a huge interest in opening CTF accounts, but also a clear need for basic, practical financial advice to help parents make the right choice. Abbey said that anyone should be able to open a cash CTF at their local branch without needing to make an appointment. If parents fail to open an account for their child 12 months after the voucher has been sent out, the government will open a stakeholder account choosing from a rotating list of providers. \u00b7 For more information, including a listing of providers, the official government site is www.childtrustfund.gov.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
