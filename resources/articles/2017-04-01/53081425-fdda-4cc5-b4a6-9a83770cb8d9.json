United trail Liverpool by two points in the race for a top-four finish, albeit with a game in hand, having drawn the Manchester derby on Thursday. After the goalless draw at the Etihad Stadium Mourinho lamented having to play \u201chalf of a Premier League more than Liverpool\u201d \u2013 it is 13 matches more \u2013 and claimed his Europa League semi-finalists were in \u201can unfair fight but we are going for that\u201d. Klopp accepts United face a punishing schedule due to progress in Europe but, having experienced a similar run last season and given the depth of United\u2019s squad, the Liverpool manager denied Mourinho and his team are at a disadvantage. \u201cI can imagine what he means but they have played a similar season to what we had last year,\u201d said Klopp, whose team could be outside the top four by the time they play Watford on Monday. \u201cThey also have a different squad, a wider squad, and with all of their injury problems they had so far they are still able to put out teams and you think:\u2018Mkhitaryan isn\u2019t playing? Rooney isn\u2019t playing? And him, and him \u2026\u2019 It is different but of course it is hard. \u201cThey have seven or eight games left \u2013 five in the Premier League, a semi-final and maybe a final \u2013 and yes that is hard, absolutely, but we had a similar situation last season, not fighting for the Champions League unfortunately, and it\u2019s not unfair, it is the situation. Nobody asked us last year how we felt about it. It doesn\u2019t feel well but I know what he means.\u201d The Liverpool manager has defended the decision to award Dejan Lovren a new four-year contract worth \u00a3100,000-a-week. The Croatia centre-half followed Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana in committing his long-term future to Anfield on Friday and, while admitting the defender\u2019s decision-making needs to improve, Klopp believes the deal represents good value to Liverpool. \u201cI am really happy about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a situation like this I know how football supporters think. If you had asked them after the Dortmund game [last season when Lovren scored a dramatic injury-time winner in the Europa League] they would have said: \u2018Give him a 20-year contract\u2019. When you see the Crystal Palace game [last Sunday] they think: \u2018Can we find another team who could have him?\u2019 \u201cThe truth is in between. If Dejan played for another club you\u2019d think about signing him and then you think what you\u2019d have to pay for him and it would be a big number of money. Giving him a new contract, working with him, he is 27 years old \u2013 the best time for a centre-half is still to come. He is physically strong, quick and a good footballer. Sometimes decision-making could be better but no one out there \u2013 and we watch a lot \u2013 is perfect. We really think he can help us a lot and we can help him in these few decisive parts of his game and that is what we want to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
