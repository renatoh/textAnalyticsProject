In its quest to find Britain's best physics teachers - those who have the \"X factor\" - the Institute of Physics polled a cross section of the UK population asking which celebrity would make physics lessons more inspiring. Boys said they preferred the Lord of the Rings character (20.8%), while girls voted the Men in Black and I, Robot star their top choice (25%). Dr Spock, Marge Simpson, Harry Potter's headteacher, Dumbledore, and pop impresario Simon Cowell also received a mention. Ian Cuthbert, who co-ordinates the awards for the IoP, said Gandalf's appeal was a surprise, but added: \"He's certainly wise, and perhaps it's his propensity for explosions and firework displays that would help him keep the attention of a class of students. We know that hands-on experiments, as opposed to simply copying equations from the board, are much more successful at making students interested in physics,\" he said. The IoP is now asking pupils, parents and those who work in schools to nominate teachers who have made a sometimes tricky subject exciting and inspiring. The institute's education manager, Daniel Sandford Smith, said: \"There are lots of exceptional physics teachers in the UK who really love their jobs. The institute's teachers awards are a way of recognising their hard work and dedication and also to show potential teachers how rewarding the career can be.\" There is still a shortage of specialist physics teachers in the UK, despite government training bursaries for science and maths teachers now standing at \u00a37,000 and \"golden hellos\" of \u00a35,000 paid at the start of their second year in teaching. The IoP believes the school curriculum needs to use real-life examples and case studies to make the subject relevant and exciting to pupils. It is now working with the exam awarding bodies to ensure the new science GCSEs to be introduced in 2006 will include motivating and contemporary physics content. More information about the awards and where to send nominations can be found on the IoP website."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
