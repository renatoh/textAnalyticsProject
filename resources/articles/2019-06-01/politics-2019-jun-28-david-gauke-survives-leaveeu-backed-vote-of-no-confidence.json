The motion accused Gauke of \u201cwilful obstruction\u201d towards implementing the 2016 EU referendum result by opposing a no-deal exit. Although Gauke supported remain in the referendum, he repeatedly voted for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in parliament. During the meeting \u2013 which ended with a vote of 123-61 in Gauke\u2019s favour, with one abstention \u2013 the proposer of the motion admitted that he had only joined the Conservative party in February. He called the MP a \u201cBrexit wrecker\u201d with an \u201cextremist anti-leave stance\u201d in his speech. Replying, the minister said that of the 50 people who pushed for the motion, \u201cthe majority have joined in the last 12 months\u201d. He said that \u201cthere [was] an attempt to fundamentally change the nature of the Conservative party\u201d taking place. \u201cAre we morphing into a new party, the Brexit party?\u201d Gauke asked. \u201cIf so, I\u2019m not the candidate for you. If I have to change my tune under the threat of deselection, then I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Following the vote, Gauke tweeted: \u201cTonight, I argued that: We should not allow the Party to be taken over by entryists. We should be a broad church. No deal would be immensely damaging to the UK. I defeated a motion of no confidence 123 to 61. I am grateful to the members of my association for their support.\u201d The result was applauded by fellow moderate Tories, with Rory Stewart, whose leadership bid Gauke had supported, tweeting that it had been a \u201ctribute to the power of truth, to his association and a tribute above all to David Gauke\u201d. Former foreign officer minister Alastair Burt said: \u201cTotal support for a great colleague, and strong, decent Conservative. Good on his association in standing up to those who may not be singing from a truly Conservative script.\u201d And Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted the word \u201cGood\u201d followed by three applause emojis. The decision by the association is a defeat for the Leave.EU campaign group. On Thursday, it tweeted: \u201cTomorrow we claim our first Cabinet scalp as DavidGauke is up for deselection in South West Herts\u201d. After the result, Gauke tweeted mischievously at Leave.EU\u2019s co-founder Aaron Banks, saying \u201cNot so fast there, Aaron\u201d. Gauke has held the seat since 2005 and was returned at the 2017 election with a majority of 19,550, increasing his personal vote to 35,128, almost 60% of the electorate. Ministers from both sides of the Brexit divide rallied to support Gauke before the vote took place. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, tweeted: \u201cTonight\u2019s motion of no confidence in @DavidGauke is ludicrous. Rounding on colleagues in this way is the type of behaviour you\u2019d expect from the hard left.\u201d She said Gauke had her \u201cfull support\u201d and expressed hope that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt would also back him. Leave.EU swiftly replied to Rudd, who backed remain, warning that she would face similar moves in her ultra-marginal Hastings constituency, which she holds by just 346 votes. Hunt did tweet support for his colleague \u2013 who is now backing him for the leadership \u2013 saying that Gauke \u201cis an outstanding cabinet colleague and we need him to carry on doing such a great job!\u201d The Brexit minister, James Cleverly, exasperatedly pointed out on Twitter that there was \u201cno deselection mechanism\u201d in the party and complained about having \u201cthese Leave.EU stories amplified by the press for months and no Conservative MP has been deselected\u201d. Cleverly, a former leave-supporting deputy chairman of the Conservatives who has said a no-deal would be \u201cdeliverable but [not] easy or effortless\u201d, said Gauke was \u201ca great MP and a huge asset to our party\u201d. Claire Perry, the energy minister who campaigned to remain, compared those seeking to unseat Gauke to Labour\u2019s left. \u201cIt\u2019s a @LeaveEUOfficial \u201cmomentum moment\u201d. Their hit list ignores the fact that MPs like David have voted repeatedly for a firm EU exit \u2013 if other MPs had joined us rather than indulging in their Brexit fantasies we would be out by now.\u201d Former ministers Phillip Lee and Dominic Grieve were not as fortunate as Gauke, having lost votes of no confidence by their local associations this year. On Thursday, Leave.EU claimed: \u201cActivists in East Surrey have now amassed more than the 50 signatures required to initiate deselection proceedings against the former universities minister Sam Gyimah.\u201d He resigned in November 2018 after voting against May\u2019s Brexit deal and subsequently endorsed the holding of a second referendum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
