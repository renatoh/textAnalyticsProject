He has been spotted drinking Irn-Bru and eating fish and chips. He\u2019s worn a hi-vis jacket. He\u2019s eaten pizza and drunk a milkshake. He\u2019s told people he\u2019s a big fan of cheese. How well hard can a man get? He\u2019s even gone for laughs by saying he\u2019d rather fight one Boris-sized duck than 100 duck-sized Borises. Not so much a Ken as a full-on Action Man. Only without the personality. But too much excitement can play havoc with a man\u2019s mind and, for his appearance on Jeremy Vine\u2019s BBC Radio 2 show, Hunt was firmly back in smouldering, buttoned-up Ken mode. The man whose eyes have launched a thousand ships and whose lips have sunk them. Vine got stuck in immediately, challenging him to counter Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d October Brexit deadline. \u201cI\u2019m a negotiator, I\u2019m an entrepreneur,\u201d Ken said, reverting to mind-numbing type. The Death of a Salesman. He wanted to deliver Brexit. He really, really did. Every day we remained in the EU was a day too long. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman, I\u2019m an entrepreneur,\u201d he repeated, his voice box stuck on repeat. He was going to get a deal because his approach was going to be different. What had been missing was the Democratic Unionist party, those smooth-talking bastards who were known for bringing goodwill and charm to any troubled waters. So he\u2019d have them onboard. But hey! If it all went wrong then Ken was tougher than the rest. He\u2019d take the UK out of the EU without even a blink. Mainly because both his eyes were now jammed open. Everywhere he\u2019d gone as foreign secretary, people had come up to tell him how much they admired our politicians and how brilliant the UK was. He\u2019s clearly not a man who appreciates sarcasm or irony. So everything would be great whatever happened. It rather made you wonder why he bothered. Ken never wholly recovered from that. He got noticeably tetchy when Vine remarked that he was the richest person in the cabinet \u2013 presumably because he felt he had yet again been underestimated \u2013 and his discomfort was complete when a caller named Julian tried to engage him on the subject of Nazi tyranny. Didn\u2019t he know Action Man soldier was the first person ashore on D-day? Sensing Ken was having a bad day, Vine invited him to chill out and choose a piece of music. \u201cI\u2019d like the Lambada,\u201d he said. This took him back to the days when he was Action Man gigolo. The single man with the chiselled good looks who had left every dancefloor in Brazil moist with sexual tension. \u201cThees eez a vair intimate dance,\u201d Ken confided in his best Portuguese. \u201cSo maybe not one for married listeners.\u201d Music for the laydeez \u2026 Music to grind to. This was an unwanted insight into Ken\u2019s sex life and it did make you wonder what he did on his spring-floored dancefloor at home. Maybe he just stared at his reflection in the mirror. After all, no one did it better than him. Vine then invited him to describe the naughtiest thing he had ever done. Ken demurred. Probably best not to mention the threesome in the favela. Or that he had completely screwed over large parts of the NHS. But he could say that he didn\u2019t spend his time building imaginary buses like Boris. Rather, he was looking forward to sailing with his children. Mainly because he knew who they were and could fit them all into one boat. Ken ended by promising to spend about \u00a320bn on social care, taking his total spending commitments to well over \u00a3100bn inside a week. Action Man banker is still very much a work in progress. For his part, Boris Johnson chose to spend the day playing with his toys while his aides tried to work out some policies for him. But his absence didn\u2019t go wholly unnoticed at prime minister\u2019s questions. Though Theresa May\u2019s did \u2013 she is now unknown even to herself. Labour MPs all wore \u201cfree Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u201d badges as a warning shot of what\u2019s in store for Johnson, and the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described him as a pathological liar. Normally such language would provoke uproar in the House of Commons, but now everyone on the Tory benches just shrugged. It was no more than the truth. A statement of fact. So what if Boris had no grasp of reality? So what if he had a personality disorder and no fixed abode? So what if those who knew him best were the ones who trusted him least? This was the Conservative party\u2019s chance to play its sick joker. And the joke was going to be on the whole country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
