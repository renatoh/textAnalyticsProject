The old match is like that. Pressure is not what is, but is what you make it to be, and in the case of these matches the most pampered sportsmen in the world usually contrive to come up with some sort of out-of-body experience. Of course other games encourage these same feelings, but only golf allows the slow torture of stretched-out time, the endless minutes of just standing around and waiting, the time to take in the crowds, the cameras and, most of all, the problems that lie ahead. Technically, every player, American and European, has the ability to hit a golf ball decently well even if blindfolded. Emotionally, however, they may find themselves almost incapable of doing what they thought they had perfected. Paul Azinger says that experience is overrated but by the time the rumble is over in Louisville next Sunday night the American skipper may have discovered that he has undervalued it. He takes six rookies to the Valhalla Golf Club, three of them his own choice, Nick Faldo takes four. Is this slight difference in experience vital? It could be. Right now, on paper, these sides are evenly matched. Europe have the momentum of victory in the past three matches, wins that were almost too easy, but America have home advantage. The US do not have Tiger Woods, Europe do have Padraig Harrington. Woods, whatever anyone claims, will be missed big-time while Harrington may find it hard to rediscover the levels of focus he exhibited when winning The Open and then the USPGA Championship. Jack Nicklaus spoke last week about how hard he found it to get himself up where he wanted to be for a Ryder Cup. Like Woods and Harrington now, Nicklaus's mind was always concentrated on the majors. By the time it came to the Ryder Cup, he was running on half-empty. According to him the US team will win. He says that if Tiger were able to play he would consider the home side to be 'big favourites' but that they still have 'the better players'. It is always worth listening to Nicklaus, but it is often worth discounting much of what he says. This latest outburst may well appeal to the patriot, but it makes little sense for this is the weakest American side of my lifetime. Where are the heroes? Phil Mickelson? The lolloping Californian has shown little appetite for the battle in the past and, historically, does his best work in the early part of the year. By the time autumn arrives what Phil does next is actually not a lot. Still, you never know. That's the beauty of it all, a pretty picture that you hope will be reconstructed this time. It has been fun whipping the Americans so far this century, but what the game needs now is the fun of a close-fought duel. Heroes, as Sam Torrance said when he was captain, often emerge from shadows. So, too, do men dressed as clowns. Someone among the rookies on either side will rise to the occasion and someone will fall. But Nicklaus does have a point. If Woods was in town then I too would award the US the edge. As it is, I can't split these sides. Much for Europe will depend on how Harrington feels deep inside and on how Sergio Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood play. Even more will rest on the pairings Faldo comes up with. Given his obsessive attention to detail and his anorak's love of stats I have no doubt he will arrive in Kentucky tomorrow with his first-day partnerships already sorted in his mind. Trouble is he then has three days to think about them and to discover that someone - want to bet it's Harrington? - has a physical problem or that this player or that just is not playing very well. Plans are great, but life is what tends to happen to you while you are making them. Torrance, for example, once cannoned himself out of a Ryder Cup when he broke his toe after sleep-walking into a plant pot. So thinking on your toes is what a captain has to do in a Ryder Cup and if Faldo turns out to be better at this than Azinger then Europe will have an edge. His decision to stick with just one vice-captain, the always admirable Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, spits in the face of that old friend experience, for there is only so much a leader can watch, only so long he can think about things before the clock ticks again and those pairings have to be in the office. Faldo, however, has lived his life alone and he is not about to change now. He may be right, too, but I doubt it. Still true to the childish side of his nature, he has ordered a drum kit for the European locker room, a small homage to his old pal Phil Collins and something that may amuse the younger players as well as annoy the hell out of their American neighbours. But no matter how much noise this European side make inside it is out on the course that people will be watching and listening and, this being Kentucky, whooping and hollering and tediously chanting 'USA, USA, USA'. Time, in this respect at least, is on America's side. Let's rumble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
