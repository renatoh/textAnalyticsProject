The problem is in his bed, and her name is Jamillia. Hassan has got married while under the influence. Soon his parents and Jamillia's Salafi Islamic family are descending on the house. Throw in a transsexual houseboy, a bigoted neighbour disputing the property boundaries, and a black policeman who has so embraced his diversity training that he is incapable of spotting a corpse, and you have a recipe for the outrageously farcical. No, you won't believe a word of the scenario in Cosh Omar's comedy, and this is not Joe Orton, not by a long way. But it's entertaining, if overextended, and both brilliantly non-PC yet absolutely right-on in its celebration of multicultural London. Omar gleefully upends all kinds of prejudices, even offering a terrific running gag concerning Jamellia's sister's wearing of the niqab. Kerry Michael's production could be much sharper, and some of the comedy is spoiled by lax timing, but the play bursts with rude life and laughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
