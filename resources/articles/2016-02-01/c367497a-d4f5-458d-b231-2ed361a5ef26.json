J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Liverpool will heed \u201cthe sign\u201d from supporters after around 10,000 left Anfield after 77 minutes of their 2-2 draw with Sunderland on Saturday, while the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation is looking into how to respond to the failure of a scheme to cap away ticket prices at \u00a320. But Owen, who scored 118 goals in 216 appearances for Liverpool between 1996 and 2004, believes supporters of other clubs will be eager to voice their frustration as well. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admire Liverpool fans for what they\u2019re doing. There are other fans around the country who could be even more aggrieved,\u201d he said. \u201cI know at certain London clubs it\u2019s nearly \u00a3100 for a ticket. It\u2019s extortionate money to pay for a ticket. Ironically Liverpool are probably one of the cheaper tickets in the country, there are clubs who are culpable for charging through the roof to watch a game. \u201cFootball\u2019s not a concert, your favourite band doesn\u2019t come once a year and you watch it, for fans who have a real passion for the game it can be 50 games a season. You have a good cup run. The last place you want to be taking money from is your fans through ticket prices.\u201d Owen added: \u201cFull credit to them for standing up for what they believe in. It\u2019s been a problem for a long time, people have been complaining about it for a long time. Now it\u2019s probably the first time people have started doing something about it.\u201d The new \u00a35.14bn TV rights deal which kicks in next season means Premier League clubs will receive at least \u00a3100m for each of the next three years if they can avoid relegation. Attempts to introduce a cap on away tickets as a first measure of keeping prices down has so far failed to get off the ground after reluctance from some Premier League clubs. However, Harry Redknapp, who grew up watching Arsenal from Highbury\u2019s North Bank, says it is now time for supporters to be respected. \u201cThe money that\u2019s pumped in now through TV and players\u2019 wages, managers\u2019 wages, coaches\u2019 wages, everybody\u2019s having a slice of the pie,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fans really should be getting the biggest slice, shouldn\u2019t they? If there\u2019s a bit to give out they should be helping the fans. It\u2019s an expensive game for people with kids and having to go to football and it\u2019s Saturday-midweek, Saturday-midweek. There are a lot of men out there working all week just to afford all their money going on taking the family to football. \u201cI\u2019m sure other clubs will be looking at that now. That will be a bit of a warning to them, this is what Liverpool fans are doing, they don\u2019t want that. Even Liverpool called off a meeting on Monday night. They\u2019ll do something about it, they\u2019re not silly.\u201d BT Sport has live football from the Champions League, Europa League, Premier League and the FA Cup.
