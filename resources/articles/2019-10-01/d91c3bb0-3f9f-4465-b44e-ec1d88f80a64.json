However, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan steadied Germany\u2019s nerves when he gave them the lead in the 51st minute and six minutes later his shot deflected off Karol Mets for an own goal. Timo Werner added a third with 19 minutes remaining as Germany consolidated second place and Joachim L\u00f6w praised his team\u2019s temperament. \u201cWe had to regroup after the red card,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe decisive factor was that we increased the tempo in the second half and kept calm.\u201d The Netherlands stayed top of the group \u2013 on head-to-head \u2013 with a 2-1 win against Belarus in Minsk, thanks to two first-half goals from Liverpool\u2019s Georginio Wijnaldum. Russia defeated Cyprus 5-0 to join the group winners Belgium in qualifying for Euro 2020. The Valencia forward Denis Cheryshev scored twice and set up two more for the Russians. Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s Belgium defeated Kazakhstan 2-0 in Astana. Chelsea\u2019s Michy Batshuayi scored in the first half and Thomas Meunier wrapped up the win in the second. In Group G, Poland qualified thanks to a 2-0 win over North Macedonia. Austria won 1-0 in Slovenia and a victory in one of their two games next month will put them in the finals. Mihaly Korhut\u2019s early strike was enough for Hungary to move second in Group E with a 1-0 win over Azerbaijan in Budapest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
