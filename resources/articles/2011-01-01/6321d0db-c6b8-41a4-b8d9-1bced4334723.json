Forest are a point off the automatic promotion places and have five successive wins in all competitions, and arrive unbeaten since November. With West Ham still bottom of the Premier League, that Forest have won only once at Upton Park since 1986 hardly feels relevant, though their hosts may be relieved at Billy Davies's suggestion that some of his key players will be rested. Both these clubs have other priorities.
