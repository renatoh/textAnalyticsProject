Booksellers across the UK were already struggling after the national lockdown this spring, with some coronavirus restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But they fear the additional impact of closures imposed in the run-up to Christmas, when some of the year\u2019s most popular books are released and there is usually a surge in sales. Bestselling novelist Holly Bourne came up with the idea of providing stores with signed, personalised bookplates to incentivise customers to buy from their local shop rather than online. When she mentioned her plans to other writers, it quickly snowballed, with more than 300 now signed up to the #SignForOurBookshops initiative, including David Nicholls, Dolly Alderton, Jack Monroe, Holly Webb, Juno Dawson and Dorothy Koomson. \u201cLockdown was announced on Saturday and on Sunday I just woke up feeling very worried for everybody,\u201d Bourne said, \u201cbut also worried that bookshops are just going to be decimated \u2013 they\u2019ve made it through the first lockdown, they\u2019ve moved mountains in order to still be operational. But this time all the Super Thursday books have just come out, people would be browsing for Christmas, and I just felt so dismayed for bookshops. I was like, I know what I\u2019m going to do. By the end of Sunday, I had over 200 offers pledging to take part \u2013 it\u2019s just snowballing and snowballing.\u201d The former children\u2019s laureate Chris Riddell has illustrated a bookplate for the campaign. Some authors have pledged to send personalised bookplates direct to customers, so they can stick them in copies bought from bricks-and-mortar shops during lockdown, while others are offering to send signed bookplates to their local store. \u201dI love the idea of authors working like Christmas elves over the next month, handwriting messages for customers promoting bookshops,\u201d said Bourne, author of novels including How Do You Like Me Now? and Pretending. \u201c#SignForOurBookshops aims to entice locked-down customers away from the lure of a certain online retailer, by providing them with exclusive access to signed books, sold only through bookshops. It also hopes to be a thunderclap of support for bookshops, reminding people to support their local stores throughout lockdown.\u201d Readers can follow the #SignForOurBookshops hashtag to find participating authors, with the scheme set to run until 2 December. \u201cMy aim for the campaign is I just want every single bricks-and-mortar bookshop that exists now to still be here this time next year,\u201d said Bourne. \u201cAuthors need bookshops as much as bookshops need authors.\u201d The former children\u2019s laureate, Malorie Blackman, is another author taking part in the scheme, which is supported by the Booksellers Association. \u201cLike a number of high-street retailers, independent booksellers are going through incredibly challenging times so I\u2019m happy to do whatever I can to help,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cSigned books make lovely presents at any time of the year.\u201d Matt Haig, bestselling author of The Midnight Library, also acknowledged the impact of restrictions on independent bookshops, despite the surge in reading during 2020. \u201cThis is devastating for the bookshops, obviously, but also for readers,\u201d said Haig. \u201cIndependent real-world bookshops are essential beacons of joy and imagination and culture in our town centres, and also create a more dynamic, meritocratic and inherently human book world, away from the supermarkets and soulless online algorithms. Just as a town without a bookshop isn\u2019t truly a town, a world without independent, informed, passionate booksellers and bookshops would be a flatter, emptier, sadder world.\u201d This week also saw the launch of an online initiative, Bookshop.org, which is pitching itself as a socially conscious alternative to Amazon. The site allows independent bookshops to create their own virtual shopfront, and gives them the full profit margin \u2013 30% of the cover price \u2013 from each sale. There are now over 250 bookshops signed up, and Bookshop.org has so far generated over \u00a350,000 in profits for UK bookshops this week. \u201cI really like their ethos in terms of they\u2019re here to support bookshops, and make it easier for people, but they\u2019re also really keen to stress that it\u2019s always better to buy direct from a bookshop,\u201d said Bourne. \u201cThe aim is to protect and promote and support bookshops.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
