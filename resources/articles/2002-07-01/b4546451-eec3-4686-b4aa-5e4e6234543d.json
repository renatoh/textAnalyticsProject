There has been a steady decline in average viewing figures for Six Nations games over the past six years and the tournament chairman Allan Hosie hopes also that exclusive terrestrial coverage will help in attracting a new title sponsor to replace LloydsTSB. \"The fact all our matches will be televised by a single terrestrial broadcaster will ensure continuity and maximise visibility,\" said Hosie, mindful that only one game in last season's championship attracted an audience in excess of three million. The BBC has pledged additional investment in presentation and promotion of matches and will fund youth rugby. \u00b7 The England U-19 full-back Adryan Winnan has signed a new three-year contract with Saracens, who have also confirmed the arrival of the fitness coach Pat Fox from Wasps. Jannie de Beer, the 31-year-old former Springbok and Sarries fly-half, has formally announced his retirement because of continuous knee problems. Leeds Tykes have signed the scrum-half Derek Hegarty, 26, from Munster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
