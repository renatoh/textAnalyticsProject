The new deal, reached after months of negotiations between the league and the players\u2019 association, includes a range of benefits relating to travel, equipment and insurance. Marquee players will receive a financial package totalling $27,000 for the 2017 season, priority players $12,000 and the remaining players $8,500. The season, which starts in March next year, comprises seven matches for each of the eight teams in the competition, plus a grand final. Under the terms of the new offer, the AFL will cover costs for footwear, an allowance for interstate travel to games, out-of-pocket medical expenses for 52 weeks post-contract and a carers\u2019 allowance for players travelling interstate with a child under 12 months old. Income protection insurance is also included, although players will have to pay for their own private health insurance. \u201cThe players overwhelmingly voted in favour of accepting these payment terms and look forward to working in partnership with the AFL and clubs to make the AFL Women\u2019s competition the success we all know it will be,\u201d said AFL Players Association boss Paul Marsh. AFL general manager of game and market development Simon Lethlean said the deal was a step towards the professionalisation of the women\u2019s game. \u201cThe AFL wants the NAB AFL Women\u2019s competition to succeed, and to be sustainable into the future,\u201d Lethlean said. \u201cThe league will be a semi-professional competition initially with players employed on a part-time basis, but we are keen for it to evolve into being fully professional as soon as possible.\u201d Netball Australia reached a deal with its players earlier this year to increase the minimum wage to $27,375 for next season, while women\u2019s cricketers who play in both the one-day and Twenty20 domestic competitions earn at least $18,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
