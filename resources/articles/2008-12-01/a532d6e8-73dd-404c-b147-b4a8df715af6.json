First, on Saturday, indicted House of Representatives' member William Jefferson \u2014 he of the $90,000 found, among the other sundry items, in his freezer \u2014 was defeated in an overwhelmingly Democratic district of Louisiana by a reactionary Republican newcomer. And earlier today, in an indictment that conjures up images of Michael Corleone discussing the politics of personal finance with Senator Pat Geary of Nevada in The Godfather, part II, Governor Rod Blagojevich of Illinois was arrested at his home. Governor Blagojevich \u2014 allegedly \u2014 wasn't satisfied with simply shaking down those who would benefit from legislation he signed or vetoed in exchange for campaign contributions. No, that was simply too mundane. Instead, even though Blagojevich knew he was under investigation for his strange brew of fulfilled pecuniary interests and sudden \"go-get 'em\" spirit on the legislative front, the governor of Illinois tried to extort the bankrupt Tribune company over financing for its planned sale of Wrigley Field (home to the Chicago Cubs baseball team), if the company would fire journalists critical of him. He was even seeking a wide array of ample handouts, including campaign contributions, a high-paying job for his wife or an appointment to Obama's cabinet or as an ambassador, in return for the naming rights to his choice of a new US senator from Illinois to fill President-elect Barack Obama's vacant seat. Where the hell is Eliot Ness when you need him? Or to quote the state's US attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, from the indictment he handed down: \"The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering,\" Fitzgerald said. \"They allege that Blagojevich put a 'for sale' sign on the naming of a United States senator; involved himself personally in pay-to-play schemes with the urgency of a salesman meeting his annual sales target; and corruptly used his office in an effort to trample editorial voices of criticism. So just as the Democrats have won some huge victories at the polls, along come the Caped Crusaders to remind us that \"Yes We Can\" for some people alludes to stuffing their pockets with everything not nailed down to the floor. But a few points are essential here. First, beware of the phony charlatans on the right, who talk a good game about reform, and then deliver you deregulation of mortgage-backed derivatives or force Jesus into your government-funded mental health programme. After the defeat of Louisiana's Jefferson, in what can only be considered the usual brand of ironic Republican comedy, self-tanning-addict-cum-corporate-cyborg and House minority leader John Boehner had this to say about another Democrat under an ethical cloud right now: After expressing his disappointment in House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) for not stripping Representative Charlie Rangel (D-New York) of his ways and means committee gavel for his ongoing ethical problems, [House Minority Leader John] Boehner writes that \"[i]n the two years ahead, House Republicans will demonstrate our commitment to reform by holding ourselves to the highest possible ethical standard.\" Really, John? Do you mean it? Because, it's funny, I distinctly remember a bunch of years back that you were caught handing out tobacco cheques on the floor of the House of Representatives? Is that what you mean by \"reform?\" Or is it Jack Abramoff? Or (also back in the news today) Larry Craig? Or Tom DeLay? Or Scooter Libby? Or John Doolittle? Or Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham? (Or Norm Coleman?) Hell, GOP senator David Vitter of Louisiana has been caught with more prostitutes than Charlie Sheen, and still he has not resigned - and plans on running for reelection in 2010. That really isn't so reform-like. The truth is that if you're a Republican official today, Intrade probably has better than even odds you'll end up in the pokey by 2010. It is also important to note that Fitzgerald makes clear in his report that Barack Obama was not aware of any of Blagojevich's \"plans\". So when the inevitable comes, and some corpulent, right-wing radio huckster or blonde cable news screecher tries to make the connection, just remember: there is none. There are certainly some bad apples in the Democratic party. (See under: \"Spitzer, Elliot\".) Thankfully they are being dealt with. But don't let the right try and use these few examples to destroy the possibility of real change coming to this country. Because then, in more ways than one, you're letting the criminals win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
