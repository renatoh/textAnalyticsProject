The Sadler's Wells colt has been suffering from a muscle problem for the past 10 days, and O'Brien said: \"As I have said before, if Yeats was not right for Epsom, he wouldn't run. \"We looked at him again this morning and his muscle problem has not improved sufficiently, so we think it is in the best interest of the horse not to run in the Derby. We plan to give him a complete rest.\" Yeats was the ante-post favourite for the race after scoring in a Curragh maiden last September, and he was well supported for the Derby throughout the winter. However, after O'Brien revealed the colt had a muscle problem he was eased in the market; following his defection, Ladbrokes have cut Frankie Dettori's mount Snow Ridge to 2-1. \"This has completely opened up the Derby market,\" said Ladbrokes' Balthazar Fabricius. \"It is effectively a new book, with numerous runners now having a great shout. \"North Light is a \u00a3400,000 loser for us so at this stage we are cheering Frankie all the way around Tattenham Corner. Whether that will still be the case on Saturday is another matter entirely.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
