So misunderstood. Many women at the deeper end of the shade spectrum assume it\u2019s for others, those at the pale end worry it will make them orange, while those anywhere in the middle are frequently so fearful of inexpert technique and tiger-striped cheeks that they buy once and use never. Which is why I say, not at all lightly, that Becca Sunlit Bronzer (\u00a327), is now legitimately my favourite bronzing powder for everyone. Here\u2019s why. It\u2019s neither matte nor glittery. The barely perceptible trace of glimmering iridescence is just enough to make skin appear healthy and vital without being remotely spangly or unnatural. The colours are few but cover a wide range \u2013 my shade is Bali Sands, which I\u2019ve worn daily since February. It\u2019s the perfectly flattering golden brown for anyone who thinks themselves too white for realistic bronzing. Maui Nights is an unusual, yet tonally correct, deep, burnished bronze, that illuminates dark brown skin sublimely (bronzer\u2019s job is not to darken, but to warm). The coverage is sheer \u2013 no chance of muddy stripes \u2013 but lasting, and this clearer pigment hides novice application errors. Oh, and it makes a fast, easy eyeshadow (fluff over lids to just beyond the crease). It is also cruelty-free. As utterly perfect as the Becca bronzer is, I know from experience that I\u2019ll have lost many of you at the mere mention of glimmer. Matte seems less risky. I don\u2019t agree, since it\u2019s usually more pigmented and defined. But if I must go there, I\u2019ll divide the best into skin tones, since few brands cater for all at the same level. If your skin is olive, brown or black, Huda Beauty Tantour (\u00a326) is terrific. The colours are thoughtfully conceived and complement not only skin colour, but differing undertones. They all have serious pigment in common and so a light touch is essential if you would like a sunny glow rather than sculpted tan, but the upside is these bronzers last all day, even on oily skins. Unless obvious is your thing (and hats off to you), Tantour\u2019s offering for Caucasian skin is limited, which makes a novel change. For the pale and shimmer-averse, I suggest e.l.f. Cosmetics\u2019 bargain Bronzer Palette, which is only \u00a37.50 for four flattering tones that swirl together to make up a convincing glow. In all cases, take a fat, fluffy brush and buff over bronzer in a figure three (temples, cheeks, jawline) on your right side, mirroring it on your left."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
