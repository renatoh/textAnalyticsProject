The Brazilian right-back is one of the most coveted players in the world and wants to join Chelsea despite interest from Real Madrid. Peter Kenyon, Chelsea's chief executive, met Sevilla's director-general Jose Maria Cruz at the Gran Fenix hotel in Madrid to finalise a package believed to be worth \u00a323m, with the bulk of the money to be paid up front. Cruz left the talks with the impression that agreement had been reached and the story filtered out to Spanish news outlets. Kenyon merely needed the seal of approval from Abramovich but to his dismay the club owner informed him that he was not prepared to pay such a sum for a full-back, no matter how gifted. He ordered Kenyon to renegotiate. Unsurprisingly this has proved problematic, with Sevilla not prepared to accept a revised offer for fear of losing face. Jose Maria del Nido, the club president, is notorious for driving a hard bargain and he angrily rejected a lower offer from Chelsea yesterday. \"Sevilla feel the offer made by Chelsea to acquire [Alves] to be way below the level we would expect,\" read a club statement. \"This being the case, Daniel remains a player of Sevilla FC.\" Alves, 24, is fully fit but was left out of Sevilla's Champions League qualifier against AEK Athens on Wednesday, which Sevilla won 2-0, so as not to cup-tie him in the competition and reduce his value. Alves, moreover, insisted that it was he who made this decision, and not Juande Ramos, the manager. \"We are trying to buy him [Alves] but the situation is not done at the moment,\" said Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho. \"We will see what happens.\" Mourinho has stated that his club will not pay \"crazy money\" but despite the stand-off one of Alves' agents, Geronimo Suarez, is \"eighty to 90% confident\" a deal will be concluded. \"He is determined to go [to Chelsea],\" said Suarez. \"He has spoken in these terms a lot of times; he has said to the press in Sevilla that he is 100% determined to go to Chelsea. He asked for Sevilla to close the agreement with Chelsea as soon as possible. These are his own words. Daniel wants to close the deal quickly. It may take two or three days, maximum one week to find a solution. However, we cannot go along in this way as the player is suffering. The situation is not good for him as he wants to go.\" Madrid have registered their interest in Alves but their more urgent target is the Chelsea forward Arjen Robben, whose frustration at Stamford Bridge grows. Abramovich's current stance is rooted in his desire to move Chelsea towards becoming a self-financing business. Despite his personal fortune, he does not want to appear to be paying over the odds for any player and wants to chip away at Chelsea's image as a club who get what they want by throwing money in various directions. Ramos, however, has already resigned himself to losing Alves. \"It's true that Real Madrid and Chelsea are trying to acquire Daniel's services,\" he said. \"We will try to overcome his absence with another player who will show the same ambition .\" Talks between Chelsea and Sevilla are ongoing and when they reach their conclusion Mourinho's back four is likely to be the envy of world football. He would be able to call upon John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho in the centre and harness the pace of Alves and Ashley Cole in the full-back positions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
