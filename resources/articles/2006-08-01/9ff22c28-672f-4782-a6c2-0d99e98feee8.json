Heather, 39, had encouraged her husband to play as often as possible during her ordeal but he stopped after the Open at Hoylake to be with her and their children Tyrone and Conor. \"Heather's courage and bravery throughout the last two years when diagnosed with secondary breast cancer has been an inspiration,\" Clarke said. \"Heather never complained once and we will all miss her greatly. She was a wonderful and enormously supportive wife, mother and friend.\" No funeral details have been announced. Clarke, 38 today, will return to the game \"when he feels ready\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
