Just because a stock has fallen, it doesn't make it cheap. It's just as likely to continue plummeting. Applies to nearly all dot.com shares. A dead cat bounce: Another favourite at the moment; after hefty falls, the stock market lurches back up temporarily. But rather than signalling the start of a bull market, the next day the market continues its fall. DYOR: Found at the bottom of messages posted on internet bulletin boards, as a get-out for the (usually wrong) opinions stated. It stands for \"do your own research.\" Where there's a tip, there's a tap: Ignore hot tips, particularly the ones liberally sprinkled over tipsheets promoting 'penny shares'. By the time you receive the tip, someone else has tapped into it, and you are probably buying into an old story. Buy on the rumour, sell on the news: Don't wait for the corporate announcement. Buy while the rumours are flying, then dump the stock when the news is officially released."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
