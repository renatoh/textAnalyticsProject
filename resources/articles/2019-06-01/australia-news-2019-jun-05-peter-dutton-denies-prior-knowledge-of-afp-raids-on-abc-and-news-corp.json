Following two consecutive days of raids on journalists who had reported on defence matters, Dutton sought to distance himself from the police investigations, saying they were independent from government. \u201cThe AFP have an important job to undertake and it is entirely appropriate they conduct their investigations independently and, in fact, it is their statutory obligation,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cI have had no involvement in the AFP\u2019s investigation into these matters. Following the execution of each search warrant on 4 June and 5 June respectively, my office was informed that search warrants had been executed.\u201d On Tuesday, the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst was raided over a 2018 report which revealed the Australian Signals Directorate was considering a plan to allow the government to spy on Australians. The AFP said the story published information that was \u201cclassified as an official secret\u201d which had the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security. In a separate raid on the offices of the ABC in Sydney on Wednesday, AFP officers executed a warrant for information relating to a 2017 documentary detailing alleged war crimes by Australian troops in Afghanistan. The head of investigative journalism at the ABC, John Lyons, live tweeted the raid as it unfolded on Wednesday, reporting the agency downloaded more than 9,000 items. He said on Wednesday evening the AFP and ABC had agreed to a two week hiatus under which any documents could be challenged. There is no link between the two raids other than both being alleged breaches of the Crimes Act for the publication of classified material \u2013 \u201can extremely serious matter that has the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security\u201d, according to the AFP. In a statement, the AFP said it had assessed referrals from agency heads about the alleged breaches and had \u201csufficient suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed.\u201d \u201cWhen the AFP receives referrals it assesses them for criminality and does not make value judgments on the issue, instead identifying whether there has been any contraventions of commonwealth law, and when evidence as to whether the offence has been committed or otherwise,\u201d the agency said. \u201cAFP investigators are required to assess all the relevant facts in every matter. This includes enquiries into the classification of the information concerned, how it was handled and who had access to it.\u201d Crucially, the agency also said it was unable to rely on revised secrecy offences inserted into the criminal code last year as the alleged conduct occurred before the new offences commenced. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the government had \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d about the raids, expressing alarm at the actions of police. \u201cIt is quite frankly I think outrageous that seven officers spent seven-and-a-half hours in her home, going through everything throughout her home, in the kitchen, in all of the rooms,\u201d Albanese said about the raid on Smethurst\u2019s home. \u201cI find it quite extraordinary that just weeks after an election for a story that quite frankly is in the public interest that that story was published, people do have a right to know if the government has proposals to interfere with their privacy in a way that I believe is something that Australians should have a say over or at least knowledge of. \u201cI would find it extraordinary if no one in the government knew anything about this.\u201d Dutton said the remarks were an \u201cattack on the AFP\u201d and called on Albanese to apologise for the \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments. \u201cI have the utmost confidence in the hardworking officers of the AFP who dedicate themselves to working to protect Australia\u2019s interests at home and abroad,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cIf Mr Albanese has any evidence of wrongdoing by the AFP he should produce the detail. If not, he should immediately apologise for his comments about the officers.\u201d \u201cLike all Australians, I believe in the freedom of the press. We have clear rules and protections for that freedom of the press and we also have clear rules and laws protecting Australia\u2019s national security.\u201d As the AFP conducted its raid on the ABC, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne was in Fiji giving a speech to the Fiji Press Club in which she praised journalists, whom she said \u201cperform a vital role in society\u201d. \u201cAs far as the media and politicians are concerned, I think that we bring different, and differently valuable perspectives to what we do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as a long-term member of the parliament in Australia, I can attest that journalists perform a vital role in society. \u201cI know the Fijian Media Association, ably led by Nemani, is doing important work also developing the next generation of journalists and reporters here in Fiji , and I am very pleased that apparently some are able to be with us here today,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
