Duncan Hunter of California was one of Donald Trump\u2019s first backers on Capitol Hill, long before it became fashionable. But like other Republicans, Hunter is showing signs of buyer\u2019s remorse. \u201cHe\u2019s just like he is on TV,\u201d the congressman reportedly told colleagues on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s an asshole, but he\u2019s our asshole.\u201d The comment was reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune, which said it was recounted by four people present when Hunter spoke at a Riverside County Young Republicans meeting at a sports bar in Murrieta, California. The San Diego-area congressman and marine combat veteran was one of the first lawmakers to endorse Trump during his divisive, anti-establishment campaign for president. A member of the House armed services committee, Hunter has written newspaper columns defending Trump\u2019s approach to Russia. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Hunter made the \u201casshole\u201d comment while speaking alongside another congressman, Ken Calvert. It continued: \u201cAccording to the sources, a woman asked the two congressmen if they had met Trump and what the president is like. \u201cCalvert said Hunter knew the president better. According to two of the sources Hunter covered his mouth when he made his statement, as if he were telling a secret. \u2018He put his hand near his mouth like when you are going to whisper something,\u2019 Jose Guzman, one of the attendees, said. \u201cThe crowd ate up Hunter\u2019s assessment,\u2019 said Whitney Walsh, who also was there. \u2018Very much. They were fine with that answer,\u2019 she said. Hunter said descriptions of Trump\u2019s personality have been accurate, Guzman said. \u201c\u2018And he goes, \u201cBy the way, all the stories you hear about him, they\u2019re true. Except the fake news,\u201d\u2019 Guzman said.\u201d The paper quoted another witness, Tami Sims, as saying: \u201cI thought it was incredibly derogatory.\u201d Hunter, whose father served 14 consecutive terms in Congress, is under criminal investigation by the justice department for allegedly misspending tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds \u2013 including by flying the family rabbit on a plane. Democrats are considering a bid to target his normally safe seat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
