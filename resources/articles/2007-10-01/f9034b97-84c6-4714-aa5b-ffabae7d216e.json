The Dutchman admitted to being infuriated by his team and urged them to be just as livid with themselves. \"It is not always about me, you know,\" he said. Jol was speaking ahead of tonight's visit of the struggling Spanish club Getafe in the Uefa Cup, with his reign under increasing scrutiny at White Hart Lane. Tottenham languish in the bottom three of the Premiership after Monday's anaemic submission at Newcastle, with only one league win all season, and huge onus is on the team to chisel victories from three succcessive home games, against the Spaniards, Blackburn on Sunday and Blackpool in the Carling Cup next Wednesday. The chairman, Daniel Levy, does not envisage instigating a change of manager imminently, largely as none of his preferred replacements would be available. But, should results not improve quickly, Jol's position would become untenable, particularly given the board's willingness to court the Sevilla coach, Juande Ramos, in August. Figures within the boardroom believe Ramos may still be tempted to swap Spain for north London although not until the end of the season when Spurs would also be more likely to succeed in their pursuit of two other favoured candidates, Jose Mourinho and the Blackburn manager, Mark Hughes. That has left Jol in effect as a dead man walking. The Dutchman's rhetoric - if not necessarily his body language - was bullish yesterday as he dismissed claims that he had lost the confidence of those in the dressing room, even if he momentarily dropped his customary insistence on defending his players. \"It was never a problem with spirit or losing the players,\" said Jol, who insisted no talks had taken place with Levy about his future since Monday. \"It is not easy to have good players and have to tell them they are not playing but I think I am good at this job otherwise I would not be in this industry. \"It is more a matter of players having to do better. We have to cut the mistakes out. If [Michael] Dawson is letting free headers in or [Younes] Kaboul is heading on to the post in the first two minutes then you have to educate them.\" More troubling for Jol's standing had been the reaction of another of his senior players, Dimitar Berbatov, with the Bulgarian asked three times to warm up from the bench at St James' Park with his team 2-1 down and in need of a riposte. \"There's no issue,\" said Jol. The Bulgarian will start this evening alongside Robbie Keane, with Jermain Defoe returning to the squad. Getafe should offer some light relief, even with Gareth Bale absent after bruising a foot and Paul Robinson unavailable for the foreseeable future because of a calf complaint. The Spanish club, like Spurs, are third from bottom of their domestic league and labouring. They arrive wary of a backlash with Jol seeking respite. Tottenham Hotspur (4-4-2; probable): Cerny; Chimbonda, Dawson, Kaboul, Stalteri; Lennon, Jenas, Zokora, Malbranque; Berbatov, Keane. Getafe (4-4-2; probable): Abbondanzieri; Cortes, Belenguer, D\u00edaz, Licht; Granero, De la Red, Casquero, Nacho; Manu, Blanco. Referee K Kircher (Germany)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
