The offer was made after the arrival, subject to a medical and international clearance, of the Brazil international forward Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim in a move that could end up costing \u00a329m, the second highest fee in Liverpool\u2019s history. Firmino, who is at the Copa Am\u00e9rica in Chile with a quarter-final against Paraguay awaiting on Saturday, has agreed a five-year contract after the Liverpool chief executive, Ian Ayre, flew to Santiago to complete the paperwork. The Brazilian followed James Milner, Danny Ings, Adam Bogdan and Joe Gomez in moving to Anfield already this summer \u2013 that quartet will officially join on 1 July \u2013 with the club, who endured such a dreadful end to last season, now turning their attentions back to Clyne. An initial offer worth around \u00a310m had been knocked back by Southampton in May for a player who is entering the final 12 months of his contract and has failed, as yet, to offer much encouragement to his current employers that he will agree terms on an extension. Southampton had hoped to secure nearer \u00a315m for the defender if he indicated he was not interested in signing a new deal. They have since secured the Portuguese right-back, C\u00e9dric Soares, from Sporting Lisbon for an initial \u00a33.6m and continue to monitor Arsenal\u2019s Carl Jenkinson, who might be secured on a season-long loan, as they bolster their own options with a Europa League campaign lying ahead. Yet the arrival of Soares appears to have been a recognition that Clyne is likely to move on this summer. Indeed, Liverpool have received sufficient encouragement to feel their improved offer will prove more successful for the 24-year-old, who earned his fifth England cap as a late substitute in the recent 3-2 win in Slovenia. Brendan Rodgers frequently used Emre Can at right-back last season despite the German midfielder\u2019s clear discomfort in the role with the manager\u2019s other options relatively limited. Jon Flanagan missed the entire campaign through injury while Glen Johnson, who will leave the club under freedom of contract on 30 June, fell out of favour and was reduced to a bit-part role. Clyne, a product of Crystal Palace\u2019s academy, enjoyed his best season yet at St Mary\u2019s to force his way into Roy Hodgson\u2019s England set-up and prompt interest from Manchester United, though it is Liverpool who have courted him most persistently. He would follow a well trodden path should he complete his move to Anfield to join Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert, all former club-mates at Southampton, in moving to Merseyside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
