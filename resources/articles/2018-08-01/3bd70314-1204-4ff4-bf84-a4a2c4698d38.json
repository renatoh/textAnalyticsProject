On a night when Britain\u2019s Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Holly Bradshaw won silver and bronze, Johnson-Thompson posted her best opening\u2011day score to lead the world and Olympic champion, Nafi Thiam, by 87 points. The brilliant Belgian was not expecting this. She has not been defeated for more than two years and said: \u201cI have a massive battle on my hands.\u201d With three events remaining, Johnson-Thompson is on 4,017 points, with Thiam second on 3,930 and the German Carolin Schafter third on 3,848. The Briton is still an outsider, given her javelin is a substantial work in progress. But for now, at least, she can dream of an unprecedented multisports treble of world indoor, Commonwealth and European championship gold in the same year. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not going to give up easily,\u201d she said, her voice hoarse with effort. \u201cI\u2019m here to win.\u201d Johnson-Thompson needed a strong start in the 100m hurdles and her time of 13.34sec \u2013 0.04sec shy of her best \u2013 was even more impressive given she has barely hurdled after sustaining a calf injury in April. \u201cI just wanted to attack,\u201d she said. \u201cI did and it paid off. I\u2019m just trying to take that mentality into all the events.\u201d Her 1.91m in the high jump, the second event, was a little short of what she had wanted but Thiam, whose personal best is 2.01m, could not exceed it. It meant Johnson-Thompson led by 51 points but there was a massive caveat: the shot put, her weakest event, was next. Usually it sends her tumbling down the leaderboard and crushes her spirit. Not this time. From nowhere she threw 13.09m \u2013 her best in a heptathlon. Understandably, she did a jig of joy that was only curtailed when her coach, Bertrand Valcin, quietly gestured not to get carried away. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered, smiling. Thiam\u2019s response was that of a supreme champion. She stepped up to the circle and threw a personal best of 15.35m and suddenly she was in the lead by 100 points. The seesawing first day was not over. When Thiam ran a moderate 24.81 in the 200m, scoring 904 points, Johnson-Thompson regained the lead by running 22.88sec to earn 1,091 points. \u201cThe turning point was when I finished the shot put and I was still second,\u201d Johnson-Thompson said. \u201cBecause normally I go down to page two on the scoreboard.\u201d She knows her chances of gold will probably boil down to the long jump, the first event on day two. At her best she can soar to nearly seven metres, which is world class. But she has struggled with mental demons since fouling three times in the event while the favourite for gold at the 2015 world championships. Those demons will have to be exorcised given her personal best in the javelin, the sixth event, is nearly 20m and 374 points behind Thiam. A long jump of 6.75m or more, however, will make things very interesting indeed. Mitchell-Blake added another British sprint medal with silver in the men\u2019s 200m. With Turkey\u2019s Ramil Guliyev steaming home in a championship record 19.76sec, Mitchell-Blake snatched second on the line, his time of 20.04 the same as Switzerland\u2019s Alex Wilson, who won bronze, and just 0.01 ahead of Spain\u2019s Bruno Hortelano. Adam Gemili ran a season\u2019s best 20.10 to finish fifth. \u201cThe last 40m were all mental and I was fortunate enough to push through for second by the skin of my teeth,\u201d Mitchell-Blake said. Bradshaw was also delighted after winning her first outdoor medal with a clearance of 4.75m to finish behind the Olympic champion, Ekaterini Stefanidi, from Greece. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in four years I\u2019ve been able to put a full year of training together without an injury or surgery, so I am really happy.\u201d Briefly there looked as if there may be a third medal on the night for Britain but Zak Seddon faded to finish fifth behind France\u2019s Mahiedine Mekhissi\u2011Benebbad in the 3,000m steeplechase. The men\u2019s 400m hurdles was surely the final of the night with the Norwegian Karsten Warholm taking gold in 47.64sec, just ahead of the Turk Yasmani Copello. Thomas Barr finished like a train in lane eight to become the first Irishman in the 84-year history of the European Championships to win a sprint medal. Warholm, who celebrated in a Viking hat, goes for a unique 400m hurdle/400m on Friday night. His celebration was mild compared with Germany\u2019s Thomas R\u00f6hler, who jumped into the steeplechase pool after throwing 89.47m to win javelin gold \u2013 a gesture that was greeted with wild applause by a crowd of close to 50,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
