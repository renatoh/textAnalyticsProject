There is a little hit of cream at the end, which is nice but it needs more vanilla. \u2605\u2605 The Co-operative Simply Value Vanilla Ice Cream 2l, \u00a31.05 Starts off being lovely and creamy but then the taste disappears. \u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Soft Scoop Vanilla Ice Cream 1l, \u00a31.80 The vanilla flavouring is quite obvious and leaves a strange taste in the mouth. \u2605 Fish fingers Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Chunky Cod Fish Fingers 400g, \u00a32.90 Easily the best one, has a lovely crunch to the breadcrumbs and great big pieces of fish. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose Essential 10 Cod Fish Fingers 300g, \u00a31.91, waitrose.com There are lovely bits of fish in these fingers but the crumbs are too soft. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Morrisons M Savers 10 Fish Fingers 250g, 60p These are so thin it's like they've forgotten to put the fish in, but what's there is reasonably tasty. \u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics 10 Breaded Fish Fingers 250g, 60p Not nearly enough fish in these and they seem to fall apart quite easily. \u2605\u2605 Digestive Biscuits Morrisons M Savers Digestives 400g, 40p Gorgeous. Nutty and sweet with a beautiful flavour. BEST BUY \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose Essential Digestive Biscuits 500g, 70p Quite plain tasting but it's not too sweet, which is a good thing. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Digestives 400g A lot of texture to this biscuit, possibly too much. It's also far too sweet. \u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics Digestive Biscuits 400g, 40p This is even sweeter, but it has a better texture and isn't too grainy. \u2605\u2605 Cheese and tomato pizza Tesco Everyday Value Cheese &amp; Tomato Pizza 480g, \u00a31.50 Lovely and crispy. Can taste herbs so it's definitely the most flavoursome. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose Thin &amp; Crispy Cheese and Tomato Pizza 250g, \u00a32.49 I like the thinness of the base but the flavour is a bit lacking. \u2605\u2605 The Co-operative Simply Value Cheese &amp; Tomato Pizza 268g, 63p Too much dough and not enough tomato or cheese! \u2605 Morrisons M Savers Deep Pan Cheese &amp; Tomato Pizza 405g, \u00a31 Way too much bread, even if it is supposed to be a deep pan. Not good at all. \u2605 Macaroni Cheese Sainsbury's Basics Macaroni Cheese 300g, 60p This is actually quite delicious. There is a real depth of flavour. Very good. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Morrisons M Savers Macaroni Cheese 300g, 80p Extra cheesy, which is good but it's also bizarrely bland. It's watery too, which isn't nice. \u2605\u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Macaroni Cheese 400g, 80p Apart from being very bland, the pasta is too thick. \u2605 Waitrose Essentials Macaroni Cheese 350g, \u00a31.79 Incredibly tasteless, apart from the salt of which there is far too much. No taste of cheese at all. \u2605 Houmous Waitrose Essential Houmous 200g, 95p This one has the best texture, and probably the best flavour, but there isn't much in it. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics Houmous 200g, 85p This is missing the good sesame kick that you'd expect. Is a bit too sour too, but not terrible. \u2605\u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Houmous Dip 300g, 98p Incredibly sour. Also, I know it's supposed to be textured but this is far too grainy, it's not nice. \u2605 Morrisons M Savers Houmous Dip 150g, 55p I wouldn't call this houmous! \u2605 Lorraine Pascale's Fast, Fresh and Easy Food (RRP \u00a320) is available for \u00a316 with free UK p&amp;p fromthe Guardian Bookshop"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
