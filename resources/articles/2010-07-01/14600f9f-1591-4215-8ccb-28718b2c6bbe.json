Every day it announces the scrapping of another planned investment because of the financial emergency it insists we are in, and sport, for all the health and social benefits the coalition acknowledges it brings, is a long way from spared. While \u00a39.375bn of public spending is still largely ring-fenced to build the venues and run the four weeks of London's Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012, Sebastian Coe's pledge, always shaky, that our Olympics will inspire a new generation to take up sport, is jeopardised further by the massive ongoing cuts. Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, earned a reputation in his six years as shadow sports secretary for diligence and genuineness in his desire to improve our nation's sporting ill-health. Yet, after just two months in office, he has already scrapped free swimming for under-16s and over-60s, cancelled an associated \u00a325m swimming pool refurbishment programme, and committed to implementing the 25% cuts required across departments by George Osborne's Treasury. A change to distribution of Lottery money will see \u00a350m more come to sport annually from 2012, which Robertson hopes will compensate for the savings his department will make, but he accepts that the scale of cuts, particularly by local authorities, will undermine the provision of sports. \"This is a very difficult time and sport will take a major hit across the country,\" the minister acknowledges. \"Everything is overshadowed by the state of the economy and the budget deficit we inherited. I am doing everything in my power to mitigate it, and [to] protect sport funding.\" All agree that the public finances must be reordered, in a recession caused not by Labour's supposed extravagance \u2013 spending money on schools, swimming pools and other public services \u2013 but by the banks' thunderous negligence. However the new government has made a policy choice that the deficit must be overturned in five years and 78% must be clawed back in cuts, just 22% in increased tax. Sport, as ever, is a perfect barometer for the effect on the nation. The top income-tax rate of 50% kicks in at earnings above \u00a3150,000; there is no higher rate for super-earners such as footballers paid as much as \u00a310m a year, their agents, Premier League chief executives on more than \u00a31m, or the chairman Sir Dave Richards on his \u00a3350,000. Yet sports facilities and schemes, often in the poorest areas, will suffer a thousand small cuts \u2013 in a nation where only around a third of people do the Department of Health's recommended daily exercise \u2013 half an hour for adults, an hour for under-16s. The Building Schools for the Future programme, cancelled by the education secretary Michael Gove, earmarked an estimated 11% of its \u00a355bn total budget, \u00a36.05bn, for modern sports facilities to replace clapped-out old gyms. Most schools would have been required to make their new sports halls and Astroturf pitches available for community use in the evenings and at weekends. That has gone now, although Gove promises to review the needs of the 700 or so schools whose rebuilds have been scrapped. Most public sports facilities are still maintained, subsidised and staffed by local authorities, which spent around \u00a31bn doing so last year even though they are still not required by law to provide the option of sport. As in the 80s, sport is certain to be a victim again, as councils must reduce their overall spending by \u00a31.2bn this year, and by 25% by 2015. Our facilities have still not recovered from the underinvestment the last time the Conservatives were in power \u2013 a 2003 report by Davis Langdon Consulting found \u00a3550m required to bring the nation's 1,718 sports centres and swimming pools up to a reasonable standard, and little of that work has been done \u2013 but cuts will fall on them again. \"Sport is a discretionary service so is very vulnerable,\" says Simon Henig, Durham county council's leader and spokesman for sport and culture in the Local Government Association's Labour Group. \"These cuts are extremely worrying, that we will take a great leap backwards, and all the efforts to encourage people to be more active, which were starting to work with joined-up thinking, will go. It is being done in such haste.\" When, in June, Robertson announced the scrapping of the free swimming programme \u2013 \"not a decision that gives me any pleasure\" \u2013 he said \"new research\" had shown the scheme \"has not delivered value for money.\" He concluded: \"With a crippling deficit to tackle, this has become a luxury we can no longer afford.\" Yet that research, an evaluation of the scheme's first year carried out by the consultant PriceWaterhouseCoopers, did not say the initiative had not delivered value for money. In fact, its report said: \"In economic terms the free swimming programme has been relatively successful.\" The researchers found that across the country senior citizens and young people went swimming fully seven million more times because of the government's subsidy \u2013 \u00a340m from five departments \u2013 which made it free. The vast majority of those additional swims, 5.5 million, were made by under-16s, who by definition did not swim previously because of the cost. That helped 32.9% of them do the recommended hour's exercise every day, up from 20.7%. Among the over-60s, 78.4% were doing their recommended half an hour a day, 12% up. The government homed in on the finding that 11 million swims were \"deadweight\", taken free by people who previously paid for them, and the money spent on the scheme was not yet being repaid in long\u2011term health. Yet the researchers concluded that, after just one year: \"Overall the impact has been positive.\" They suggested the scheme be built on to \"ensure the free swimming programme delivers the desired outcomes to an even greater degree, including enhanced value for money\". They recommended local authorities work harder to market the free entry to attract non-swimmers, and \"make facilities more attractive to lapsed swimmers through capital improvement projects\". That gave free swimming the potential to repay, in improved health, every penny invested \u2013 and so justify the previous government's ambition that it would create one fitting legacy of the 2012 Olympics. Instead, the scheme has been scrapped, and the \u00a325m earmarked to upgrade pools withdrawn. Robertson maintains that despite cuts being his government's priority, he will argue to keep his budget, for the benefits sport brings. The Lottery change will bring in extra money, and he is determined that refocusing the 2012 pledge, which he will announce shortly, will lead Sport England to try to use the Olympics more effectively to increase participation. Jeremy Hunt, minister for culture, media and sport, has said the \u00a39.375bn Olympic budget is \"not sacrosanct\", and a \u00a327m cut was imposed on the Olympic Delivery Authority but, in truth, the vast bulk of that budget is guaranteed. The 2012 Olympics will be London's, and Britain's, advert to the global village, demonstrating to the mass television audience and those in the new 80,000-seat stadium, for which there is still no viable after-use, a carnival of British can-do. The government will not want the world to see the hangdog pools which will not now be refurbished, the schools we cannot rebuild, or that we have begun charging children from poorer families \u00a32 apiece to go swimming once again because allowing them in for free was \"a luxury we can no longer afford\". \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2010.
