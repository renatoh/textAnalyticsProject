This summer, it\u2019s another Nigerian singer, Wizkid, whose name is a fixture all over the charts. With two songs \u2013 the groovy reggaeton hit Daddy Yo and a collaboration with the Canadian rapper Drake on Come Closer \u2013 on the Billboard and UK charts alongside Drake\u2019s One Dance (the 2016 summer anthem), which he lends his vocals to, and Tinie Tempah\u2019s Caribbean-influenced Mamacita, which he elevates with a well-delivered hook, it\u2019s officially Wizkid season. All of this has culminated in a staggering seven nominations at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards tonight even as he prepares to join a star-studded cast at the UK Wireless Festival in London this summer. Ayodeji Ibrahim \u2013 Wizkid \u2013 began singing at the age of 11 in the church choir. A few years later, he formed a boy band, SI, while running errands in the studio where musicians 2face Idibia and Jazzman Olofin recorded circa 2004. When his debut album, 2011\u2019s Superstar, was released three years after he secured his first record deal, it broke industry records and the launch was well attended by the cream of the music business. It reinforced what many had suspected from the singles since he was first introduced to the listening public; the innocent-faced kid had a knack for cooing catchy hooks and plastering greatness on guest features. \u201cFrom when his very first single was released, he has always had a je ne sais quoi\u201d, says Ayodeji Rotinwa, pop culture writer for ThisDay, one of Nigeria\u2019s most read dailies, and Forbes Africa. \u201cI think he has been smart in branding himself early as a collaborator rather than coming to shake up things on the international scene right away.\u201d Aided by a solid label and management, Wizkid got into bed with top-notch producers, fellow artists and promoters across Africa and the UK, stacking up collaborations, playing at gigs and morphing into a continental sweetheart. \u201cApart from being talented, he\u2019s a charming young man, and whether you admit it or not being charming helps,\u201d says Gbemi Olateru-Olagbeji, from Beat 99.9 FM, a Lagos radio station. \u201cHe started his networking a long time ago. In 2012, Chris Brown came to Lagos for a performance. At some point during the show, Wizkid was on stage with him and even danced with him. A few months later, he was hanging out with Brown in Los Angeles. This was before he released Ojuelegba. He didn\u2019t let that chance meeting end at a few words, a handshake and a selfie. It went beyond that and became a friendship. I\u2019m not saying Brown gave him his big break but he\u2019s definitely part of the story. He continued to meet people, make contacts and the rest is history. Talent is not enough.\u201d But the turning point was undoubtedly Ojuelegba \u2013 a mid tempo ode to the Lagos slum where he grew up \u2013 off his second album, Ayo, listed in Rolling Stone\u2019s 15 great albums you didn\u2019t hear in 2014. Nigerian-British rapper Skepta set the ball in motion \u2013 then passed it on to Drake \u2013 for the heavy-hitting remix that went viral past Africa, Europe and into many households in the US, including that of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys. Neither rifts with his old label nor a thinly veiled head-to-head battle with archrival Davido, in a mirroring of the Cristiano Ronaldo-Lionel Messi phenomenon, have marred his steady rise. Instead, he is the latest bride of music giants Sony Music/RCA. \u201cHe\u2019s always had the drive and thoughts of global recognition,\u201d says rapper Willybang, a childhood friend who previously went by the moniker Silly. The second half of SI, he was namechecked on Ojuelegba (Me and Silly, from Mo\u2019Dogg\u2019s studio, we been hustle to work ... ). \u201cHe was like Brain in Pinky and the Brain, always wanting to take over the world. \u201cThen it was only older musicians like Brenda Fassie and Miriam Makeba were recognised outside Africa, except for people like 2face, who was young and inspired us. Together we would patiently watch these legends record; it was after three or four years of doing this that we got a chance to record for the first time,\u201d says Willybang. \u201cAt one point, his parents didn\u2019t want to see me around his house because they thought I was a bad influence on him, making him hang around studios. We had no money but we had the drive. Even later, at Mo\u2019Dogg studio, we would have to tilt the generator sometimes to completely use the last of the petrol.\u201d These days, Wizkid is the poster boy for a new school of artists fashioning their own sounds from the continent inside out and embarking on a journey into genre obfuscation including Tiwa Savage (signed to Roc Nation) Sony Music\u2019s Davido, Mr Eazi, Maleek Berry, Tekno and Burna Boy; Ghana\u2019s R2Bees and Sarkodie; Kenyan boy band Sauti Sol; Cassper Nyovest, Nasty C, AKA \u2013 all from South Africa \u2013 and the DRC\u2019s Fally Ipupa. Christened Afrobeats (and disliked by musicheads because of its divergence from Fela Kuti\u2019s socially conscious Afrobeat) by the UK-based Ghanaian DJ Abrantee, it is an umbrella for contemporary African sounds that has welcomed influences from house, dancehall, jazz, pop, R&amp;B and highlife. \u201cI think Wizkid gives other African artists visibility just by being present. He has the world as his audience now,\u201d says Rotinwa. D\u2019Banj\u2019s arrival on the global scene led to his split with his longtime collaborator and business partner, the revered producer Don Jazzy, and an eventual flop, which explains why Nigerians are waiting with bated breath for the unfolding trajectory of their next homegrown superstar. Wizkid has only two albums to his credit and no single mixtape \u2013 and his new music has been seen on the home front as more Caribbean than Nigerian. Mr Eazi, one of the artists Wizkid has signed up to his Starboy Entertainment imprint and the continent\u2019s breakout star in 2016, is optimistic. \u201cWizkid is one of the most talented artists ever out of Africa, he is blessed with the melodies, but most of all he works hard. His work rate even pushes me to go harder. \u201cI believe Sony is taking his project as priority and Wizzy is not leaving his destiny in the hands of others. His ability to blend into whatever genre yet still keep his signature feel might be his strongest suit. \u201cWith someone like Wiz representing Africa, it will invariably lead people to check out other African music \u2013 and that\u2019s a positive for new acts,\u201d adds Eazi. \u201cWho knows? We might be the next [viral genre] like reggae, especially with a lot of pop stars sampling different elements in our music.\u201d Olagbegi agrees: \u201cThe international record labels are paying more attention to African artistes now. They\u2019ve been sending representatives to Lagos, having meetings and signing deals.\u201d THE WIZKID CV Born 16 July 1990 Family Grew up with 12 sisters.
