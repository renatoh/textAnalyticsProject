An announcement was expected from the FA yesterday but it will not be made now until tomorrow at the earliest. Officials at Soho Square have emphasised that nothing sinister should be read into the delay but it is the second of its kind and is being perceived as possible bad news for Ferdinand, who was initially led to believe a decision would be taken towards the end of last week. The FA is deliberating whether to charge the England and United defender with missing the test at United's training ground on September 23 or to charge him with the more serious offence of wilfully missing the test, something that carries a maximum two-year ban. If the FA opts for the latter charge, it will need to prove that Ferdinand deliberately avoided the test rather than accept his excuse of simple forgetfulness. To make such a charge stick, its case will have to be watertight, hence the concern at Old Trafford about the time it is taking for the FA to announce its decision. It was thought that, if Ferdinand were to face the less serious charge, the FA would have been in a position to announce as much by now. United's lawyers intend to argue that a precedent was set when Christian Negouai, a fringe Manchester City player, missed a drugs test last season and received nothing more than a \u00a32,000 fine. The crucial difference, however, is that Negouai, a 28-year-old Frenchman, could use in his defence that he spoke hardly any English at the time. That case also occurred before Mark Palios took over as the FA's chief executive, immediately making it clear he intended to take a harder stance against drugs offences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
