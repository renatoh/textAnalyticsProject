How else do you explain why crowds bumping along at 25,000 all season were transformed overnight into 36,000 for the visit of Walsall? Unless Walsall have suddenly become the nation's unlikeliest crowd-pullers, or the debut of Wayne Quinn was the stuff to set home pulses racing, Saturday was simply the day that Sunderland supporters said: \"Howay then, get your coat on.\" Marcus Stewart's first-half goal rewarded their faith. Sunderland now lie fourth and Wigan Athletic - top again after their defeat of Gillingham, and creating little miracles on crowds of around 7,000 - must observe Sunderland's march back towards crowds of 40,000 and shudder at the forces ranged against them. Mick McCarthy, Sunderland's manager, reflected upon the need to win back the crowd's emotions, favour, respect and belief. But it was forgiveness that was most required and, 12 games into the season, the town bestowed it. McCarthy summed up the afternoon as: \"Hard-earned, frustrating, scrappy, three points, great day. It might have been frustrating but it's not half as frustrating as losing.\" And Sunderland learned a lot about losing last season. Stewart was also prominent in the victory at Preston during August that avoided the shame of equalling Darwen's 104-year-old record of 18 successive defeats. Now the emphasis is more on Darwin: survival of the fittest, elimination of the weakest. Last season's failures have been cast aside. The new guys do not lack for energy. Stewart is one of the few survivors, alongside what he summed up as \"lads who were in our reserves, or someone's reserves, last season, players with no mental scarring\". He should not face extinction for a good while yet. His winning goal oozed class as he purred from halfway on to Jeff Whitley's knock-on, evaded Danny Hay and beat Jimmy Walker on his right side from 15 yards. Gary Birch came within a whisker of equalising within a minute. Walsall were down to 10 men from the moment that Chris Baird was sent off for a tackle from behind on John Oster, dangerously pacy, in first-half injury-time. It was a bit harsh - Baird was the last defender by a matter of inches - and it would have been harsher still had not a linesman convinced the referee to downgrade his penalty decision to a free-kick outside the area. Stewart might have had a hat-trick, but he knew the value of a tense, unconvincing victory. \"We gave the supporters something to cheer today - if only once,\" he said. \"We are just on loan to this league.\" As if all these loaned players weren't bad enough, now it seems that they are loaning out clubs as well. A growing number of Sunderland supporters will tell you that the loan will be paid up in the spring. But, as the Barclays chief executive might put it, that's what they all say. Man of match: John Oster (Sunderland)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
