It was the 40th anniversary for the band that took British folk to mainstream rock audiences, mining the dark elemental mystery of traditional music with classic albums such as Hark! the Village Wait and Please to See the King. They are also the first and, one suspects, last band to have a hit with a 16th-century Latin incantation, 1973's Gaudete. And yet it all felt very much like business as usual. For the first half, Maddy Prior led her band through a set of mostly traditional material in a way that was perfectly executed but lacking in energy \u2013 the product of a long-touring act over-familiar with their material. Prior sang beautifully, and danced in a way that was reminiscent of a frisky aunt who's had too much sherry at a Christmas party, but a lack of stagecraft meant that renditions of delicate English tunes such as I Live Not Where I Love were robbed of their romance. The first hint of magic came when Prior and the virtuoso fiddle player Peter Knight duetted on The Great Silkie, a haunting Scottish tale of a half-man, half seal. After the interval, folk music stalwarts and former Span members Martin Carthy and John Kirkpatrick came on, bringing a revitalising power with them. Suddenly, it felt like a celebration. Prior sang the Lark in the Morning and All Things Are Quite Silent, favourites from the early albums, with a new gusto. The band were loosening up and enjoying themselves. Even a few mops of grey hair flailed about in the audience. This was all leading to a singalong of All Around My Hat, the 1975 hit that officially made Steeleye Span the least cool band in the UK, and now a song of undeniable joy. It was a reminder of what this singular band has achieved, even if this wasn't its finest moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
