El Grupo de la Muerte. Die Todesgruppe. Every World Cup has one (and more often than not, more than one) and the Socceroos\u2019 group in Brazil, which includes Spain, Holland and Chile, has more than a touch of rigor mortis about it. But are the labels worth it? In recent times, it\u2019s not just been World Cups that require a \u201cGroup of Death\u201d for smooth pre-tournament hype-building but also European Championships, Champions Leagues, heck, even qualifying competitions. As a result, we\u2019ve had some pretty shoddy examples. We were told that a group containing Brazil, \u201cCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s\u201d Portugal, \u201cAfrica\u2019s second-best team\u201d Ivory Coast and collectivist cannon fodder North Korea was 2010\u2019s version. Four years before that we had Italy, USA, Ghana and Czech Republic in Group E and in 2002 there was England, Sweden, Nigeria and the Argentinians. Tricky groups, sure. But hardly of the ilk of the horror shows that led to the coining of the phrase. For that we can thank the Mexican journalists who, in 1970 decided that a group containing the reigning champions, England, eventual winners Brazil, 1962 runners-up Czechoslovakia and the unfortunate Romanians was worthy of the moniker. Since then there have been some beauties: try Group C at Spain \u201982 \u2013 home to reigning champions Argentina, winners Italy and lowly Brazil \u2013 for size (although some would say this was not a true group of death as it took place in the second stage of the tournament, meaning the teams were not victims of the draw). Not deadly enough? Only one team could advance. Today\u2019s seeding system \u2013 and the expansion of the World Cup to 32 teams \u2013 surely renders a pool of such bubbling, spitting malice a thing of the past. Yet it must seem to Ange Postecoglou that the Socceroos have found themselves smack bang in a group, not just of death, but of torturous, slow, painful death. Death by Chile\u2019s high-intensity and perfect preparation and the touch of class of Holland, before the Spanish maim the motionless corpse with a tik, a tak and a thousand passes. Except there\u2019s a catch. Folk over in Groups D and G would say their fixtures are far harder. And they\u2019ve got a case. They certainly stand up to the recent editions listed above. Group D \u2013 with Italy, England, Uruguay and Costa Rica \u2013 has a similar, if slightly less extreme, feel to Australia\u2019s pool, with a minnow accompanying a pair of historical European heavyweights and a lavishly-stocked (relative) local, while Group G, containing Germany, Portugal, USA and Ghana, has the highest average ranking so should, in theory, be the toughest to advance from. But herein lies the problem with this term and the reason for its devaluation: there are hundreds of ways of defining a group of death. If we\u2019re going down the \u201caverage ranking\u201d route, then the Socceroos\u2019 group is unsurprisingly the simplest of the three because Australia, as an extreme outlier with a Fifa ranking of 59, drag the mean down. Equally predictable is that Australia, with that inferior ranking and those blue-blooded opponents, has the toughest draw of any team in the tournament. Recent history points the finger at B, but if we look a little further back then Group D \u2013 with seven World Cup wins across between its participants \u2013 is the stinker. For pure congestion, Group G is a good shout, with Germany likely to advance and the rest \u2013 yes, that includes world No3 Portugal who struggled in qualifying and are overly-reliant on a certain bronzed underwear model \u2013 jostling to join them. But whether Group B is a bona fide group of death or not, it\u2019s hard to avoid the thought that Australia\u2019s World Cup fate was decided at the draw in Bahia back in December. As they arrive at hell\u2019s gates, is there even a jot of hope of escape? Well, yes, actually. They\u2019ve qualified and will play each of those teams for 90 minutes with victory, although unlikely, entirely possible in all three. The Spanish can be prone to goalmouth profligacy, are past their peak and remember that when they won the tournament in 2010 they lost to Switzerland in the group stages. The Socceroos beat the Dutch, who have a combination exploitable youngsters, gifted luxuries and shaky defenders that makes a first round exit a possibility, on their last meeting. The Chileans are tipped to go far but are hardly the \u201958 Brazilians. Australia can only dream of having the riches of their opponents and, with football the country\u2019s most played sport, may one day have them. The best bet is surely to sneak a result against the Dutch or Chileans before toppling the already-qualified Spain, who would probably play a weakened team, in game three. This, after all, is the World Cup; the tournament that gave us group stage wins for North Korea over Italy in 1966, Cameroon against Argentina in 1990 and Senegal over the champions France in 2002. Easier said than done, of course, but pull the hearse over: Australia can advance from 2014\u2019s Group of Death. Or one of them, anyway.
