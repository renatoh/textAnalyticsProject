During yesterday's Vermont presidential primary, two small towns in the famously liberal state also approved resolutions indicting Bush and vice president Dick Cheney for \"crimes against our Constitution\". No specific crimes are mentioned, but organisers of the anti-Bush effort have referred to perjury, obstruction of justice and war crimes related to the Iraq conflict. The resolutions ask town attorneys in Brattleboro and Marlboro to draft indictments without outlining how to enforce them, giving the charges little practical consequence. \"I have not seen the proposal, and I've done no legal research on any of the issues,\" Vermont attorney general William Sorrell told the Associated Press before yesterday's vote. \"But at first blush, if this passed, they'd have really uphill sledding trying to have it be legal and enforceable.\" That did not stop residents of the two New England towns, where the indictments passed by 18 votes in one public meeting and more than 200 votes in a separate ballot race. Vermont is the only state in America that Bush has yet to visit, according to published tallies. Meanwhile, a more serious effort is underway in Vermont to rebuke the Bush administration's war policy, as several local legislators push for a vote on legislation recalling the state's national guard troops from Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
