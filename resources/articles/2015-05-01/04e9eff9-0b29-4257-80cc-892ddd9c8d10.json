Trumpeting his superiority over his entire peer group, his ability to convert lesbians and his familiarity with the clothes of Rick Owens (yeah, you and every other rapper this side of Milan), he\u2019s snide and bad-natured \u2013 particularly in a gross kiss\u2019n\u2019tell about Rita Ora. But the sheer equilibrium of his bars elevates him to near-greatness; few can cook up the bland stock of bitch, whip and suck into such tangy, lip-smacking morsels.
