After a creditable, but dull, 0-0 draw in Scotland on Friday, USA endured another scoreless night in Vienna to lose their final game of the year. Marc Janko scored the only goal of the game in the 33rd minute to finish a flowing move by the Austrians. The closest USA came to scoring was when Austria's Marko Arnautovic flicked the ball towards his own goal but officials ruled that it didn't cross the line. After the strong 2013 that carried USA to Gold Cup victory and into the 2014 World Cup finals, coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann now has seven months to finalise his squad and his best line-up. The two games on this trip will not have helped a great deal, other than made it harder for some fringe players to force their way into contention. Austria 1-0 USA - as it happened"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
