The accusation came during the summing-up of the four-day tribunal, in which former Investec analyst Louise Barton claims she was the victim of sexual discrimination. Ms Barton was paid \u00a31.1m in pay and bonuses over a four-year period while her former junior colleague, Matthew Horsman - who she had helped to recruit - received \u00a32.2m. David Reade, representing Ms Barton, said it was \"unbelievable\" that Investec had no written material to account for the huge difference in bonuses. In 2001, Ms Barton was paid \u00a3300,000 while Mr Horsman received \u00a31m. Another male colleague, Mike Savage, was paid \u00a3600,000. \"The complete absence of contemporaneous material at a firm of 140 people with a \u00a375m turnover is unbelievable,\" said Mr Reade. \"There is not a single piece of information about how the bonuses were calculated. We are told that all the material was destroyed. All we have are their explanations, which are not consistent... and not satisfactory at all.\" He said accusations by Investec that Ms Barton had begun a campaign of non co-operation had only been introduced when figures used to justify her lower bonus failed to add up. And he said Investec had secretly given Mr Horsman a \u00a350,000 pay hike and had only increased Ms Barton's salary when she discovered the rise and complained. \"The differential was unjustifiable so they equalised their salaries,\" said Mr Reade. \"But they did not equalise their long-term incentive payments [worth an extra \u00a375,000 to Mr Horsman]. Why? Because Ms Barton hadn't found out. They were able to maximise profits by the ignorance of a female worker.\" But Roy Lemon, representing Investec, said the company had rewarded Mr Horsman for his high media and PR profile and the amount of business he had helped to generate. He said Ms Barton had been \"coloured by resentment of the success of Mr Horsman\". \"We are talking about the difference between an extremely high income and a fantastically high income,\" said Mr Lemon. \"Mr Horsman had a very high profile in what came to be regarded as the new frontier of opportunities [the TV and new media sector.] Although Ms Barton was valued, she was not key in the sense that Mr Horsman was.\" Mr Lemon said revenue was a key determinant of staff bonuses, and said Mr Horsman had generated many more times revenue than Ms Barton in 2000 and 2001. When Mr Horsman out performed her it was a case of \"significant sour grapes,\" he added. A verdict in the case is not expected until September at the earliest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
