Indeed, take away Istabraq and the standard of two-mile hurdlers has been weak in recent seasons. Now we understand the British Horseracing Board is to take action and provide a boost in prize money for two-mile hurdlers later this year. Races to benefit range from juvenile events to handicaps. There has been concern for a number of years that competition from all-weather Flat racing has tempted away potential hurdling talent with prize money at the bottom and medium levels on the sand generally higher and fixtures less likely to be abandoned. The latest initiative is a step in the right direction but to get Group-class horses like previous champions Royal Gait and Alderbrook off the Flat to go hurdling it is likely that changes at the top, where no race for two-mile hurdlers other than the Champion Hurdle is worth more than \u00a3100,000, are also going to have to be made. Festival fourth day looks short on quality The shortlist the races to make up the fourth day at the 2005 Festival are a two-mile juvenile handicap hurdle, a two-and-a-half mile novices' chase, which could be a limited handicap, a three-mile novices' hurdle, a mares' race which is either a bumper or hurdle, a cross-country chase and a two-and-a-half mile novices' handicap hurdle. It all smacks, as we have feared since the idea was first mooted, of quantity rather than quality. Snub for Savill over tax on course layers The on-course bookmakers are still rebelling against the imposition of a gross profits tax due on April 1 and they took a sideswipe at British Horseracing Board chairman Peter Savill by refusing to price up the first race at Plumpton last week. Savill is chairman of the Sussex course. After Soeur Fontenail had won the novices' chase the bookmakers found another ally. Steve Delve, who heads the syndicate that owns the mare, refused to accept the winner's trophy in protest at the planned tax. Delve, a former Sporting Life journalist now operating as a starting price returner in the betting ring, is upset at the way on-course layers have been treated. 'I realise that it will be seen that I have an axe to grind in that my job depends upon the on-course market but I disagree so strongly with what Mr Savill is trying to achieve that I cannot accept the trophy. This has nothing to do with Plumpton, which I think is a tremendous racecourse and I will continue to have runners here,' he said. Putting his money where his mouth is, Delve is helping sponsor a race in memory of his Sporting Life colleague Stuart Oliver at Plumpton next week. Attheraces off the pace with prices There is still plenty of disquiet about racing channel Attheraces and starting price reporter David Smalley, who has made a careful study of the Tote odds on the channel in the build-up to races, has pointed out to us that they are far from accurate because they are nowhere near up to speed. Net profit fails to lure trainers history when successful at 20-1 in a modest Sedgefield handicap chase in December. The Micky Hammond-trained chaser was the first winner to have been entered and declared a runner on the internet. Weatherbys, racing's secretariat, launched internet entries in 2002 and this year added declarations to run as well. Hammond and fellow Yorkshire trainer George Moore took part in trials for the system. One trainer who has embraced the innovations is Jonjo O'Neill but generally trainers have been slow to take advantage of internet entry. What's In A Name Sean At The Ivy, a dark horse for the Cheltenham Festival Bumper who makes his debut tomorrow at Fontwell, is named after Sean McDermott the doorman at The Ivy, the famous London restaurant. McDermott has a tough job - every Saturday night he has to face Channel 4 betting guru John McCririck who always has table 17 booked and invariably tucks in to shepherd's pie. McDermott, who boasts of getting tables at the haunt of the stars for such racing luminaries as John Magnier, JP McManus, Christy Roche and John Gosden, has a rather special guest arriving tonight as Tattenham Corner will be making an appearance.
