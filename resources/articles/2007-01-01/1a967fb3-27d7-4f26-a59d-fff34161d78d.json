On arrival at Heathrow I discovered one of my bags was very badly damaged, ripped and spilling its contents. Most of the gifts we had bought in the US were ruined and some of our clothes were missing or damaged. The damage amounted to approximately \u00a3270. I eventually got through to BA, which sent me a replacement suitcase, but I've had no response about the missing and damaged items. I did not contact my travel insurer as I thought BA would be able to settle with me and I didn't feel it was fair I should have to pay an excess fee when the airline is responsible for damaging my possessions. FB A Airlines are responsible for all losses and damage to baggage in their possession, though their liabilities for lost and/or damaged baggage on international flights is limited by the Montreal Convention, which uses special drawing rights (SDRs) as a form of international currency. The limit for baggage liability is 1,000 SDRs, and \u00a31 is currently equal to 1.3 SDRs, so the maximum claim on the airline would be \u00a3769. The airline is likely to ask for receipts of damaged or lost goods and is entitled to scale down the claim on the basis that clothing, for example, was not brand new and therefore no longer worth its purchase price. Claiming for particular items that have gone missing can prove impossible, as you would have to prove the items were there in the first place. And you wouldn't be due any compensation if any damaged or missing items contravened the rules on what you are permitted to carry in your checked-in baggage. You'd be far better off claiming from your insurance company, though at this stage that may also be problematic because of the length of time that has elapsed since the incident. Contact BA again, by recorded post, asking for a letter confirming that your suitcase and its contents were damaged. You can then send BA's letter to your insurer to support your claim. Send your letter to Baggage Claims, Unit (S506), PO Box 5619, Sudbury, Suffolk CO10 2PG. If you get no joy there, complain to Customer Relations - Unit S506, which is at the same address. Good luck."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
