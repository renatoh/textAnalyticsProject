McEwan's novel Saturday and Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go were among books by 17 authors chosen in a list which also heralds the return of heavyweight writers from previous years including Julian Barnes, Salman Rushdie and JM Coetzee. And the presence of other admired authors like Ali Smith, Hilary Mantel, John Banville and Rachel Cusk reinforces this by giving the choice its strongest literary flavour for almost a decade. Nestling among them is The People's Act of Love, a step into fiction from the Guardian journalist James Meek. McEwan and Barnes emerged last night as the bookies' favourites to take the \u00a350,000 prize - one of the book world's most sought-after honours - at the final ceremony in October. William Hill's choice as 3/1 favourite was McEwan, who won the award in 1998 with Amsterdam but was unlucky with his more recent bestseller Atonement. It made Barnes a 7/1 chance, below Coetzee and Ishiguro. But Ladbroke's rated Barnes' story Arthur &amp; George as 4/1 favourite, followed by McEwan at 5/1, Rushdie at 7/1 and the veteran writer Dan Jacobson at 8/1. Coetzee, author of Disgrace, is a Booker double winner, in 1983 and 1999. Ishiguro won in 1989 for The Remains of the Day. Jacobson's place on the longlist at the age of 75 is one of the more remarkable features of the judging. A quietly respected writer, he won his first prize, the John Llewellyn Rhys, in 1958 for his short story collection A Long Way from London. His first novel The Evidence of Love came out in 1960. Rushdie is the most garlanded author on the list, having taken the Booker for Midnight's Children in 1981 and the Booker of Booker awards as the best of all the novels which have competed for the prize. Yet the Iranian fatwa against Rushdie in 1990 coincided with the beginning of a long eclipse in the prize world. His return to favour, and that of others in the list, was attributed by some observers last night to the absence of celebrities from this year's judging panel. Earlier this year Jon Howells, the Ottakar's executive who helped organise the Theakston's Old Peculier crimewriters prize, said most awards were decided by \"a gaggle of academics, plus the obligatory model\". This year's Man Booker judges, under Professor John Sutherland, are relatively unusual in being a novelist, a writer and antiquarian book dealer and two literary journalists, without a single television face among them. Yesterday Prof Sutherland said: \"This has been an exceptional year. In the judges' opinion it may rank as one of the strongest ever since the prize was founded in 1969. \"It is also a nicely balanced longlist with four previous Booker winners, three first novels and a satisfying range of styles. The judges have enjoyed their judging experience enormously - so far.\" Last night Rodney Troubridge, fiction buyer for Waterstone's, said it was good to see heavyweight authors well represented. His predictions for the shortlist included Marina Lewycka's comedy A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and The People's Act of Love. \"Both books have been on our radar for a while and we are delighted that they will find a wider audience due to this longlist,\" he said. Mr Howells said another heavyweight, John Banville, was turning into a new Beryl Bainbridge in the prize stakes: \"Critics love him, he's had a couple of listings but has never won. Maybe this is his year.\" The contenders The Harmony Silk Factory, Aw Tash What it's about The enigmatic Johnny Lim, possibly hero, gangster or Communist.

Then his son falls in love with the daughter of an eminent rightwinger What they say \"As EM Forster's Howard's End did before it, On Beauty asks important questions about the relationship between culture and power.\" The Observer This Thing of Darkness, Harry Thompson What it's about The captain of the Beagle, Robert Fitzroy, a conservative Christian, locks intellects and destinies with his passenger Charles Darwin What they say \"This brilliant recreation ...in turn terrifying, hilarious and uplifting.\" This is the Country, William Wall What it's about A teenager sets the defences of love, friendship and family against power and corruption in Ireland What they say \"Hard-hitting ...deeply moving.\" Amazon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
