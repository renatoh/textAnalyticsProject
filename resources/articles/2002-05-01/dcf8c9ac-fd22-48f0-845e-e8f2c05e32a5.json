A criminal offence of identity fraud would mean that the police and the courts would no longer have to rely on offences being committed after somebody's identity has been stolen. The move follows official warnings that online crime is rapidly replacing breaking and entering as the preferred method of the skilled thief. The proposal is to be published in a white paper in the next three months. A recent Cabinet Office report said that the move to internet and telephone transactions meant that existing systems of identification and authentication were no longer sufficiently robust. A passport could not be verified online and criminals were increasingly hijacking somebody else's identity, for example by obtaining a credit card in their name. The government is considering ways of making it much harder to obtain a driving licence or passport by deception, by improving the security of the documents. The passport service is looking at issuing a plastic card using a microchip alongside the current passport book. The consultation paper will also outline a scheme to set up a database of \"stolen identities\" so that electronic checks can be carried out online. Home Office ministers want to set up a police database of known and suspected fraudsters against which applications for government services could be cross-checked. Heavily trailed plans to introduce a national ID card scheme are also contained in the white paper, but ministers have admitted that there is no similar urgency with these plans. However, the home secretary, David Blunkett, has made clear his support for the introduction of a \"citizenship entitlement card\", saying it would enable people to prove their identity more easily and also provide a simple way to access a range of public services. The Home Office minister, Lord Rooker, has said that the white paper will be followed by a consultation period \"rather longer than normal\". If legislation followed, it could take two years or longer. The consultation paper will include an estimate of the cost of introducing a national entitlement card scheme. Ministers have argued that modern technology has brought down the estimated price for such a scheme from the \u00a31bn cited when a Conservative home secretary last considered the idea. Home Office civil servants have also held initial talks with banks to discuss whether they might be involved in issuing the cards so that using \"smartcard\" technology a bank credit card could double up as an official citizenship entitlement card. While the consultation paper will set out the advantages and disadvantages of a compulsory card, Mr Blunkett has made clear it will not be a criminal offence not to carry the card and the police will not have the power to demand to see it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
