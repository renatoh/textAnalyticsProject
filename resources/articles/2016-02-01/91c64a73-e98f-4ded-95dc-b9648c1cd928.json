Amid renewed determination from the FA, Premier League and Football League to address long-term issues surrounding fixture congestion, Glenn also revealed that they would join forces to take on Uefa over the creeping number of \u201cblackout\u201d dates as a result of European competition. \u201cWhen I talk about reform I think we have to reform together with the leagues and reform the fixture schedule period, for the good of English football,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cLots of things have to give. This isn\u2019t an FA Cup problem. That hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 all the things around it have. We\u2019re always open to evolve the competition, keep it relevant, make it attractive.\u201d He said that the FA, Premier League and Football League had recently completed four-year plans and agreed it would be sensible to take a strategic look at the fixture calendar. One aspect could be to explore again the idea of giving the FA Cup winners a Champions League slot, he said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d love to see that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would add lustre to the competition. You can\u2019t solve things in isolation. It\u2019s a Rubik\u2019s Cube. That might be one possibility Of course, running the FA, I\u2019d love it. \u201cIt just needs to be set up and weighed up against all the other criteria and the desires of the competition owners, the Premier League, the Football League, etc. I think it would be attractive but you\u2019ve got job one [which] is make sure we\u2019ve got enough coefficient points in Europe to make sure we keep the four places.\u201d Before a fifth-round weekend in which the issue of fixture congestion has again reared its head owing to the scheduling of Manchester City\u2019s trip to Chelsea three days in advance of a crucial Champions League tie, Glenn said nothing was off the table. Alongside the possibility of axing FA Cup replays and two-leg League Cup semi-finals, another hardy perennial \u2013 reducing the Premier League to 18 teams \u2013 could be part of the blue-sky thinking exercise. \u201cIf you wanted a winter break, things would have to change,\u201d Glenn said at a Kick It Out fundraising event. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t automatically mean that the Premier League would have to come down to 18 clubs either. I think there are other ways of fixing it but it just needs a holistic look at the entire calendar. It needs challenging probably Uefa about windows, so we need a negotiating strategy for that.\u201d Besides a shared determination to challenge Uefa over the number of midweek dates reserved for its competitions, Glenn said there was a desire in English football to relieve the possible damage fixture pile-ups could do to the national side and the chances of English clubs in Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re all just saying the same things, which is: \u2018This isn\u2019t great where we\u2019re kind of managing from hand to mouth. We should get round to looking at it.\u2019 But it\u2019s a long-term thing, not a short-term thing.\u201d There can be no changes to the FA Cup until after 2018, when the current TV deals come to an end, and any changes to Uefa\u2019s rules that forbid fixtures being scheduled on the same night as Champions League or Europa League matches would take time to negotiate. In the past, prize money has been withheld from English clubs because the rules were flouted. The possible introduction of a winter break appears more credible than at any time since the dawn of the Premier League in 1992, after Glenn said that although it was not yet official FA policy he thought there was \u201chuge merit\u201d in the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s not FA policy but I would love there to be a winter break,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be good for the England team, I think it\u2019d probably be good for the clubs. So, how might you design a season that looks like that?\u201d Historically, the Premier League has argued that FA Cup replays would have to go if a winter break were to be considered. Glenn said there were no active talks but that there was a shared will to take the issue forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
