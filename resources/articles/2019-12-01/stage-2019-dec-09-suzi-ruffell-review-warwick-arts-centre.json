It\u2019s a spectacle in itself, then, to see Suzi Ruffell, confronted with a frigid crowd, throw herself at the challenge of warming them up. Her success is impressive. She calls out the coolness but doesn\u2019t dwell on it. She cajoles but doesn\u2019t coerce. She fashions lively local debate from minor confusion over which town we\u2019re in. None of which has anything to do with the show she\u2019s come to Coventry \u2013 or should that be Warwick? \u2013 to perform. But, by the time it begins properly, she has the audience at her command. Save for the bulletproof smear-test routine at its centre, there\u2019s nothing remarkable about Dance Like Everyone\u2019s Watching, which relates Ruffell\u2019s newfound domestic contentment and tentative parenthood plans. There\u2019s amusing stuff, about shopping for \u201clesbian accoutrements\u201d \u2013 and, to her horror, being recognised while doing so. And there\u2019s material (on the different stages of moving house; on WhatsApp messaging her new neighbours) that doesn\u2019t quite respond to her lively efforts to animate it. But Ruffell is a very likable presiding spirit, combining daft physical comedy (witness the human cartoon of her mum struggling to keep a secret) with disarming emotional candour \u2013 about the tension in standup between confidence and anxiety; about purging her vestigial gay shame at a time of rising homophobia. And then there\u2019s that cervical screening set piece, performed in a spotlight, and honed to a high-yield three minutes of comic mortification. It\u2019s an evening that proves Ruffell has the skills to win over a bashful audience, and a show pert enough to keep them happily onside. \u2022 At Palace theatre, Southend, on 13 December and touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
