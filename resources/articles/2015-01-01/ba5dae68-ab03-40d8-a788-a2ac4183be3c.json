It should probably be called Whitney and Bobby: The First Five Years, if we\u2019re going for accuracy, or Whitney and Bobby: Before It All Went to Shit, if we\u2019re trying to be arch. Lifetime has a bit of a cottage industry making these lackluster biographical movies of celebrities who died before their time (recent editions include Brittany Murphy and Aaliyah). This one is no different other than the blockbuster talent it has behind the camera. Whitney is the directorial debut for Angela Bassett, a woman more famous for her relationship with Tina Turner (she played her in the biopic What\u2019s Love Got To Do With It) than she is for hers with Whitney Houston. Bassett\u2019s involvement is really the only thing that makes this stand out from all the other hack jobs that Lifetime has done. Like so many other movies on the channel this one features inexpensive sets (Bobby and Whitney\u2019s house looks like it was on loan from an episode of Miami Vice and hasn\u2019t been really kept up since it went off the air in 1989), cheesy dialogue, and costumes that are ridiculous if not period accurate. Whitney tells the story of Houston and Bobby Brown from the time when they met at the Soul Train awards until five years later, after their wedding, the birth of their daughter, and Brown\u2019s first stint in rehab. Bassett told the press this is a love story, but it\u2019s one whose tragic consequences are basically ignored. Sure, we see Whitney smoke cigarettes and do some lines in her bathroom, but the story ends before their lives really get dark, with the diminished careers, the Bravo television show, the \u201cshow me the receipts\u201d interview with Diane Sawyer, Whitney\u2019s failed comebacks, the couple\u2019s divorce, and Whitney\u2019s eventual drug-related death. That the scenes are mostly stagnant, featuring lots of two-handers between either Whitney and Bobby or one of the duo and other characters is not shocking. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect from these Lifetime movies \u2013 lots and lots of talking. What is slightly shocking is the number of sex scenes (and even the top half of a butt). Most shocking of all is how well Bobby Brown comes off in the whole affair. He\u2019s shown to be the good guy, never touching drugs and always doing right by his kids. Sure he cheats a few times and gets drunk, but then he goes to rehab to try to fix it all. Now, I wasn\u2019t inside the relationship so I don\u2019t know what happened, but just based on media coverage and their old reality show, it\u2019s hard to say he\u2019s as blameless as he comes off here. Wait, I was wrong. The most shocking thing about the movie is that they shelled out for the rights to a handful of Houston\u2019s songs, sung with stunning fidelity by dance diva Deborah Cox. One of the best revelations of the movie is remembering just how remarkable these songs were. They\u2019re the best thing about the whole movie, even if they aren\u2019t even the real thing. Former America\u2019s Next Top Model contestant Yaya DaCosta is rather good as Houston. She has Houston\u2019s tone and mannerisms down and even looks a little bit like the star. She isn\u2019t given much to work with, but elevates the bland material to something far better than it deserves. Arlen Escarpeta isn\u2019t nearly as good as Brown, though he serviceably delivers his lines, which isn\u2019t guaranteed in an enterprise like this one. It\u2019s sad that Whitney doesn\u2019t focus on all of Whitney and instead tries to paint a rosy picture. But that doesn\u2019t mean this special isn\u2019t without its tawdry appeals. Lifetime is airing a special, Beyond the Headlines: Whitney Houston, immediately following the premiere featuring interviews with Houston\u2019s friends and family. However, Access Hollywood has scored an interview with Brown himself, also airing at 10pm ET on Saturday, in competition. Perhaps Lifetime couldn\u2019t put up enough money to get Brown interested but Access Hollywood could. That just goes to show that, even when it comes to Bobby Brown, it\u2019s only Whitney that still matters. If only we had a movie that honors her memory as well as her music does on its own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
