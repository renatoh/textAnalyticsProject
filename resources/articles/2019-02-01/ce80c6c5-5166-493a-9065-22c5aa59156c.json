That is more than fine with Joshua, who understands that fans would rather be served a long-awaited summit meeting with Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury than Miller, an unfancied former kickboxer who has been installed as a 5-1 underdog in the contest. \u201cMy view on the whole situation is they\u2019ll appreciate you when you\u2019re done,\u201d Joshua said on Tuesday at the Garden. \u201cSo right now I\u2019m just going with where the best opportunities are and I\u2019m making the right decisions for the long term. I\u2019ll beat up Jarrell Miller, and what that then does help me do is say to Wilder: \u2018Look, if you don\u2019t want want to come to the UK, you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve done in the US, so let\u2019s work on having it here on both of our terms.\u2019\u201d Joshua, unbeaten in 22 professional bouts, did little to conceal his view of the fight as a proof of concept for his appeal in the US \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll be deadly serious: Jarrell can\u2019t beat me, even on his best day,\u201d he said \u2013 so he has left the heavy lifting to the outspoken Miller, who has already been working overtime selling the fight by sheer force of personality. On Tuesday alone Miller accused Joshua of being \u201cfake\u201d, an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d and a \u201cgiant pussy\u201d \u2013 and that was before it got personal. \u201cIt\u2019s just jealousy in my opinion,\u201d Joshua said of Miller\u2019s bluster. \u201cJust hate for no reason. I respect my opponents. But if they disrespect me, they get the worst of me as well.\u201d The 2012 Olympic champion was quick to break down Miller\u2019s limitations as a fighter, including his weight (more than 315lb for his most recent fight) and a casual mention of the challenger\u2019s nine-month suspension for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine handed down by the California State Athletic Commission in 2014. \u201cHe\u2019s slow,\u201d added a slim-looking Joshua, who said he is walking around at 115kg. \u201cHe\u2019s not a puncher. Ex-kickboxer. Probably be better off in the NFL. Substance abuse. Got caught on PEDs. I can\u2019t really respect that, so talk is cheap. I\u2019m just going to back that up in the ring.\u201d He added: \u201cI keep hearing about his stamina and that he\u2019s a pressure fighter. A fighter gets tired when they get hit, and he gets hit a lot. It doesn\u2019t matter how good his stamina is. If I keep on punching \u2013 his jaw, his body \u2013 he\u2019ll soon fade. He\u2019ll soon find out what it\u2019s like. \u201cThe best chance he has is to land a big right hand or a big left hook, but that\u2019s not really going to happen, so he\u2019s going to get beat.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
