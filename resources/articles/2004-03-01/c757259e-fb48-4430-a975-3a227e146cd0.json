Price of US light crude rose to just over $37 a barrel in morning trading, extending a 2.3% surge on the New York mercantile exchange yesterday. US refiners prepared contingency plans for possible supply disruptions in Venezuela, Opec's third biggest producer, despite assurances that this would not happen, and the Bush administration said it was \"extremely concerned\" about surging oil prices. In the latest sign of political turmoil in Venezuela, the country's ambassador to the UN, Milos Alcalay, said he was resigning in protest over the policies of President Hugo Chavez, lending his weight to demands for a recall vote. Venezuela is a leading supplier of crude and refined oil products to the US. \"The situation in Venezuela is certainly worrying. The surprise resignation of the Venezuelan ambassador to the UN over his government's policies suggests that the problem in the country is very serious,\" David Thurtell at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Reuters. The US energy information administration (EIA) warned that with oil stocks below normal levels, any problems at a refinery or pipeline might trigger supply disruptions and push up prices. Putting additional pressure on prices, Venezuela said Opec, the oil cartel, would stick to its decision to cut production limits in April, despite recent rises. \"We are firm in our decision to keep the 1m barrel per day production cut to maintain our prices,\" the Venezuelan oil minister, Rafael Ramirez, said yesterday. Several producers, including Iran, the UAE and Nigeria, have already informed refiners of reduced supplies from April 1. Saudi Arabia, Opec's leading producer, is due to decide export volumes for April in about a week's time and ministers meet again on March 31 for a scheduled review of policy. Oil prices have stayed firm because of the booming economy in China, the world's second-biggest oil consumer. The country's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said at the opening of parliament today that China would boost production of coal, electricity and oil products to ease its energy squeeze. China's crude oil imports hit a record 91.1m tonnes in 2003, 31.2% higher than the previous year. Its crude imports for January this year rose 23% from the same month last year to 10.3m tonnes (2.5m barrels a day)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
