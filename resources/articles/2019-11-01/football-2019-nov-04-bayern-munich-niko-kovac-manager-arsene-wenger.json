At first, we assumed he\u2019d been on the WeissTin again, because he was just making noises, but then he stopped speaking German and explained that Bayern Munich had given their manager Niko Kovac a kick up die hintern and marched him out of the door marked Do One. And according to F\u00fcnfer, all this means that for the first time in yonks the Bundesliga title race may resemble something more than a season-long Lewis Hamilton victory lap. Bayern\u2019s 5-1 shellacking at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday left last season\u2019s double winners languishing \u2026 um \u2026 four points off the top with a dire record of \u2026 um \u2026 10 wins, three draws, and three losses in all competitions. To add to their shame, they are only five points clear at the top of their Big Cup group, too! Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid all have similar records this season but none of them have hoofed their managers yet, have they? \u201cThe performances of our team in recent weeks and the results have shown us that there was a need for action,\u201d blabbed chief suit Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, while triple-bolting the Allianz Arena exit door behind him. Kovac must have been fuming. \u201cI think this is the right decision for the club at this point in time.\u201d Ah. Perhaps not. Which makes The Fiver believe that not only do we know nothing about human feelings but we also know nothing about just how intensely the humourless Bavarians hate their team being laughed at. It\u2019s hypocritical really, considering they have made ridiculing their players an annual tradition by dressing them like garden gnomes, giving them oversized tankards of Tin and making them pose for Oktoberfest photographs. The Fiver can\u2019t help but think that the timing of the decision may have had as much to do with the club\u2019s super chief suit Uli Hoeness\u2019s upcoming departure on 15 November as it does with the quality of Bayern\u2019s football. Hoeness, who has never been one to keep his trap shut when headlines can be made, said only two days ago that decisions taken at the club were \u201calways about FC Bayern and not individuals\u201d. Unless that individual is him, which may explain why he tapped into his inner Jack Nicholson, grabbed his axe, and decided to go out swinging. Hoeness now has just enough time to have a say in who replaces Kovac and the chatter on Monday was that there are four leading names: Max Allegri, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and, wait for it, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger! Yes, sorry Jos\u00e9, Wenger\u2019s ability to speak German has made him a very real contender for the Bundesliga\u2019s biggest job. In 2017, Wenger\u2019s Arsenal were on the end of two 5-1 thrashings by Bayern Munich in the space of a fortnight. He knows all about turning an ailing mega-club around after being humbled by such a scoreline doesn\u2019t he? Oh. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe \u2018people\u2019 of this curva who made the monkey chants. Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you. In front of your children, wives, relatives, parents, friends and acquaintances... shame\u201d \u2013 Mario Balotelli posts a message online after being abused with monkey chants during Brescia\u2019s defeat against Verona.

FIVER LETTERS Niklas Bendtner [Friday\u2019s Fiver] always struck me as briefly diverting if there was nothing else on right at that very moment, but irritating on prolonged exposure, and always mysteriously overrated. It\u2019s like asking a wedding DJ for \u201csomething a bit alternative\u201d and getting Love Shack\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard. \u201cI think Oliver Billenness (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters) might have overestimated the amount of readers The Fiver gets etc and so forth \u2026\u201d \u2013 Jon Haskoll. \u201cWould the Fiver be kind enough to give me the names of the four tea-timely emails that I apparently prefer to this \u201cfifth favourite.\u201d [Friday\u2019s Fiver].
