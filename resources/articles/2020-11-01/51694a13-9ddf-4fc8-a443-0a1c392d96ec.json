Matt Kean said a 20-year NSW electricity infrastructure roadmap released on Monday would lower the cost of electricity, create jobs in regional areas and avoid the state having to rush to build new generation as ageing coal plants closed in the years ahead. The scheme involves the government awarding long-term contracts for three different types of technology \u2013 wind and solar farms to be built in three regional renewable energy zones, long-duration storage that can provide back-up power for eight hours or more, likely to come from pumped hydro or batteries, and fast-start \u201cfirming\u201d generation that ensures grid stability in a grid that increasingly runs on variable renewables, likely to come from batteries or gas. \u201cThis plan will be the reason NSW is well-placed to be a clean energy superpower,\u201d Kean told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ll see more renewable energy built in NSW than Victoria and Queensland combined over the next decade.\u201d Nearly 20% of the electricity in NSW and Queensland and a third of the electricity in Victoria over the past month came from renewable sources. The Victorian Andrews government is supporting 928 megawatts and promised at least another 600 megawatts through its renewable energy target as it aims to reach 50% renewable energy power by 2030. The Palaszczuk government in Queensland also has a 50% clean energy goal for 2030, though some have doubted whether it will meet it on its current path. Kean said announcements by China, Japan, South Korea and US president-elect Joe Biden mean 70% of Australia\u2019s major trading partners had committed to a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by or near 2050. The mid-century target is backed by all Australian states, but the Morrison government continues to resist it, though it says it would like to reach that goal \u201cas quickly as it\u2019s able\u201d. The NSW minister said the global push to cut emissions could open up opportunities in green steel, hydrogen and aluminium, created using renewable energy, as the fossil fuel markets would down. The state government forecast its policy could spur $32bn in private investment, create more than 6,000 construction and 2,800 ongoing jobs and save households on average $130 a year. NSW Labor welcomed the plan, saying the government appeared to have adopted much of the policy the opposition took to the 2019 state election. Labor\u2019s climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Searle, said NSW was \u201cin a race against time\u201d to deliver what was needed after \u201ca decade of delay\u201d. \u201cThis must be done in a way that delivers cheaper energy for homes and businesses, tens of thousands of new jobs, and strengthen our state\u2019s manufacturing sector,\u201d he said. The Clean Energy Council\u2019s chief executive, Kane Thornton, agreed it would set up NSW \u201cto be Australia\u2019s number one destination for renewable energy investment over the coming decade\u201d. The plan involves solar and wind plants being built in renewable energy zones in the central west, New England and near Wagga Wagga, with projects in these areas promised faster approvals and shared new transmission infrastructure. The reverse auctions will be run by a new \u201cconsumer trustee\u201d, likely to sit within an existing agency, such as the Australian Energy Market Operator. Energy companies will bid in reverse auctions for 20-year contracts in which they compete to offer the lowest estimate for the electricity they will generate. Each year contracted companies will be able to opt-in or out to receive the floor price for the electricity. If they choose to opt in, they will be locked to that price \u2013 if they earn less, the government will pay them the difference, but if they earn more, they will be required to pay the government the gap. The contracts are planned to include a clawback mechanism \u2013 if the government pays the company in a year in which prices are low, the company will be required to pay it back if it makes a windfall in a subsequent year. The idea is that in any given year a company can be certain of a minimum price. The Australian Industry Group\u2019s chief executive, Innes Willox, said the plan was a \u201cthoughtful approach that will do significant good for energy users\u201d and commended the NSW government for its \u201cwillingness to take bold action\u201d. But he said it continued the fragmentation of the national electricity market along state lines. \u201cThis is understandable, given the pressing need for action and the repeated failure of national reform initiatives \u2026 but there are important risks in a state-by-state approach,\u201d Willox said. \u201cInconsistent approaches can increase costs and confuse the market. Narrow state perspectives can miss opportunities to make everyone better off.\u201d Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said NSW was right to be concerned about the lack of federal policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions given that the state had committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and the risk of there not being enough supply when coal plants inevitably closed. But he was concerned the state government seemed to have lost confidence in the electricity market and work being undertaken by the national energy security board, which was meant to address the same problems. He said the state was taking on investment risks on behalf of consumers that should be left to energy companies. \u201cThe result is a clear shift to central planning across the board,\u201d Wood said. \u201cHowever, intervention and even giving up on markets seem to be the name of the game in energy policy these days. This is by no means the worst example.\u201d The state approach contrasts with the Morrison government\u2019s emphasis on a gas-led recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, and decision not to introduce an overarching policy to encourage private investment in wind and solar after the national renewable energy target was filled last year. It says the technologies are not mature and no longer need support. The federal Coalition is instead promising to underwrite investments in new \u201cdispatchable\u201d electricity generation, including gas-fired power. It has also set \u201cstretch goals\u201d to lower the cost of some \u201cclean\u201d technologies as part of its technology investment roadmap but these goals are not tied to a timeframe or emissions reduction trajectory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
