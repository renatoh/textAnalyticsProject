The vast majority have wished him well, including a good-luck card from members of the West Bromwich Albion supporters' club, promising to visit Boundary Park to see one of his first matches back. Whether Hughes deserves his \"second chance\" is a delicate and highly emotive subject and the 31-year-old is acutely aware that the relatives of Douglas and Maureen Graham have already spoken of their bitter sense of injustice to see him returning to such a highly paid, high-profile profession. Douglas, 56, was killed when Hughes crashed his \u00a3100,000 Mercedes after a boozy night in November 2003, before fleeing the scene. Maureen, his widow, suffered terrible injuries, and died in her sleep 13 months later. In Hughes's words: \"I have had to live with myself, hating myself, every day.\" His was a difficult performance as he faced the cameras for the first time since signing a two-year agreement with the League One club. Pale and drawn, with dark smudges beneath his eyes, he sometimes stumbled with his words and obviously found it a harrowing experience, but he seemed grateful, too, for an opportunity to show contrition. \"This the first time I have been able to make a public apology,\" he said. \"I only wish I could turn back the clock. I have served the sentence laid down by law, but nothing I can do, or say, can change what has happened. I've made dreadful mistakes and decisions that will live with me for the rest of my life. I'm so remorseful for what I have done. If I could change back time I would. But I can't. I can only apologise and keep saying sorry, but I know that isn't good enough for some people and that they won't forgive me. I made the biggest mistake of my life and I can't change that.\" The chance to resurrect his career dates back to the January transfer window when the Oldham manager, John Sheridan, decided to search for a new striker and his chairman, Simon Blitz, calculated Hughes was halfway through a six-year sentence and might be entitled to parole. Seven months later, Hughes hopes to make his Oldham debut and \"score lots of goals\" as soon as he is back to full fitness. It does not reflect well on the former Coventry City and West Bromwich player that he is currently suspended, having been sent off in his last match for the Featherstone Prison team, but his critics should note he has written to several Premier League clubs asking to speak to their players about the dangers of fast cars and drink-driving. \"If I can help even one person to avoid getting into the same situation, it will have been worthwhile,\" he explained. \"I've let my family down and I've been away from my little children for three years. I see their faces, unhappy all the time. It has greatly affected my own family and I will never forgive myself for that.\" Forgiveness is something he does not expect after Sharon Montgomery, the Grahams' daughter, saw him in prison recently. \"What was said will always remain a private and personal matter,\" said Hughes, who has also written to Albert Frisby, who was driving the car in which the Grahams were travelling. Information has come back to him that the gesture went down well. For his new employers, their stance throughout has been, to quote Blitz, not to pass \"moral judgment\" and that it is a simple business decision, bringing in a striker who was once talked about as a potential England international. \"They have been fantastic from the first day we met,\" said Hughes. \"It has taken me a lot of time to decide what to do, but I was playing football inside and keeping fit. \"There were other clubs, some in the Championship, who wanted me. But Oldham have been extremely understanding with my family. I spoke to a lot of people before deciding I wanted to come back and I'm determined now to do well for them. I'm not here to be a hero and I don't want to be the centre of attention. I just want to play football. I know there are some supporters who won't want me here but hopefully I can make myself a better person and show them that I know I have made the biggest mistake of my life but that I can turn it around.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
