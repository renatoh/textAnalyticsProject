Ivan Rogers, who resigned from his post in 2017 after clashing with Theresa May\u2019s senior advisers, suggested it was \u201cprobable\u201d the UK would leave the EU without a deal in what he described as an act of \u201ceconomic lunacy\u201d. He said the Tory leadership election brought to mind the quote of the French statesman Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord about the Bourbons in that they had \u201clearned nothing and forgotten nothing\u201d. \u201cWe hear all manner of undeliverable promises, made as if the events of the last three years have made no impact on the collective consciousness,\u201d Rogers said of the remaining leadership candidates. Boris Johnson, the clear frontrunner to be the next prime minister, has said the UK will leave the bloc on 31 October with or without an agreement with the 27 EU member states. Rogers said Johnson\u2019s stance, and the inevitable EU rebuff to a time-limit on the Irish backstop or an alternative arrangement, suggested many were underplaying the risk of Britain crashing out. There is a widespread perception in EU capitals that a general election is \u201ccoming really rather soon \u2013 and much sooner than anyone is prepared or incentivised to admit\u201d, Rogers said of Johnson\u2019s likely response to parliament seeking to block a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThis is why serious players in Brussels and certain capitals have concluded, as have I, that we are now rather likely to be headed for a breakdown to \u2018no deal\u2019,\u201d he said in his latest speech on Brexit. \u201cWe all know this is a great country. Sadly, it\u2019s one currently very poorly led by a political elite, some masquerading as non-elite, which has great difficulties discerning and telling the truth. I am discouraged by just how badly Brexit has been handled to date, and currently pessimistic that this is going to get any better any time soon.\u201d On Tuesday, Germany\u2019s EU affairs minister, Michael Roth, speaking before a meeting of ministers from the 28 member states in in Luxembourg, reiterated the EU\u2019s refusal to countenance a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement once the UK has a new prime minister. \u201cI don\u2019t see any chances to renegotiate the package,\u201d Roth said. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement is the withdrawal agreement and I don\u2019t see any appetite to start new negotiations within the EU \u2026 The message of the EU is crystal clear on this issue.\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said he was sure that Johnson, as a former mayor of London, would be pragmatic, but that there was no hope of a renegotiation. He said: \u201cWe have signed an agreement with Theresa May and I really don\u2019t want to misuse this press conference to really say that Theresa May did the best possible job. \u201cShe had a really difficult job, but she did the best possible agreement able to get and this won\u2019t change now there is a new prime minister. The deal is not with the prime minister, the deal has been agreed with the Government, with the UK, with the institutions.\u201d Rogers, who resigned as the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU in January 2017, said a no deal was not overly feared in EU capitals and that Johnson as prime minister would likely make a similar error as May by hemming himself in through a speech to party conference soon after arriving in Downing Street. In 2017, May had told Tory party members that she would take the UK out of the single market and a customs union, two pledges that posed the problem of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and maintaining \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d. Rogers said: \u201cI am worried that the longer the sheer lack of seriousness and honesty, the delusion mongering goes on, the more we imperil our long-term prospects. \u201cI was in Brussels running the preparation process for the then prime minister\u2019s first European council in October 2016, and able to feel the severe frost \u2013 and, as I say, also the total internal solidarity - her speech 10 days previously to the party conference had engendered,\u201d Rogers recalled. \u201cWell just think ahead to the October European council this year, three years on, which will be the EU debut, and perhaps the final curtain too, for the next PM, just two weeks after a first party conference leader\u2019s speech. \u201cAnd do we think whoever wins the leadership contest will, in their first leader\u2019s speech to conference, have set out a subtle, nuanced, principled and collaborative approach to sober up the party faithful for the many difficult compromises ahead?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
