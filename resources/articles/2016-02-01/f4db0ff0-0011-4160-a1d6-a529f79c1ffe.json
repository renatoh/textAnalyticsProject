Ars\u00e8ne Wenger wanted cover in central midfield, a player with the capacity to play the defensive role and he got Mohamed Elneny, who looks like a smart signing. He did not want anyone else, and so he did not get anyone else. End of story. The return of injured players pleases the manager more. David Hytner Aston Villa Ins None Outs Joe Cole (Coventry City, free), Callum Robinson (Preston North End, loan), Joe Bennett (Sheffield Wednesday, loan), Gary Gardner (Nottm Forest, loan), Jos\u00e9 Angel Crespo (Rayo Vallecano, loan), Jed Steer (Huddersfield), Tiago Ilori (Liverpool, loan ended), Philippe Senderos (released) It has been a miserable January in the market for Villa. R\u00e9mi Garde\u2019s side are 10 points adrift of safety and have failed to sign a single player during the window. They had tracked the Ivorian forward Seydou Doumbia before his loan move from Roma to Newcastle, while deals for Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, Mathieu Debuchy and Wahbi Khazri never materialised. James Riach Bournemouth Ins Lewis Grabban (Norwich City, \u00a37m), Benik Afobe (Wolves, \u00a39m), Juan Iturbe (Roma, loan), Rhoys Wiggins (Sheffield Wednesday, \u00a3200,000), Marius Adamonis (FK Atlantas, loan) Outs Jayden Stockley (Exeter City, loan), Yann Kermorgant (Reading, loan), Lee Tomlin (Bristol City, loan), Elliott Ward (Blackburn, undisc), Alessandro Cannataro (released), Tomas Andrade (released), Ryan Allsop (Wycombe Wanderers, loan) While the Argentinian winger Juan Iturbe still looks like a rabbit in the headlights at times, Benik Afobe, the club\u2019s record signing from Wolves, has settled quickly, scoring two goals in as many matches. Lewis Grabban, who returned to Bournemouth after an 18-month hiatus at Norwich, is popular with team-mates but will need time to convince he is worth an inflated \u00a37m fee second time around. Eddie Howe certainly now has enough firepower at his disposal for the final straight, though. Ben Fisher Chelsea Ins Alexandre Pato (Corinthians, loan), Matt Miazga (New York Red Bulls, undisc.) Outs Wallace (Gr\u00eamio, loan), Papy Djilobodji (Werder Bremen, loan), Alex Kiwomya (Fleetwood, loan), Christian Atsu (M\u00e1laga, loan), Ramires (Jiangsu Suning, \u00a324.3m), Patrick Bamford (Norwich City, loan), Charly Musonda (Real Betis, loan), Mitchell Beeney (Newport, loan), Marco van Ginkel (PSV Eindhoven, loan) The window ended up feeling like a clearing of the decks. Ramires\u2019 departure for a hefty fee will help financially in the summer if players on Champions League contracts have not secured Champions League football. But the arrivals of Pato and Miazga hardly had the pulses racing, and some of the club\u2019s younger players might surely have merited an opportunity instead. Dominic Fifield Crystal Palace Ins Emmanuel Adebayor (free) Outs Jonny Williams (MK Dons, loan), Jack Hunt (Sheffield Wednesday, \u00a31.2m), Jake Gray (Hartlepool, loan), Jerome Binom-Williams (Leyton Orient, loan) The window was largely one of frustration, with Palace\u2019s interest in the likes of Islam Slimani and Khouma Babacar put on hold by their current clubs\u2019 valuations. Instead, they secured Emmanuel Adebayor, who has played 17 minutes of Premier League football in a year, in the hope he retains an appetite to flourish in the English game. A risk? Perhaps not on a short-term, incentivised deal. DF Everton Ins Oumar Niasse (Lokomotiv Moscow, \u00a313.5m), Shani Tarashaj (Grasshoppers, \u00a33m), Matty Foulds (Bury, undisc.) Outs Steven Naismith (Norwich City, \u00a38.5m), Aiden McGeady (Sheffield Wednesday, loan) Liam Walsh (Yeovil Town, loan), Shani Tarashaj (Grasshoppers, loan) Roberto Mart\u00ednez wanted to trim his squad but after banking \u00a38.5m for Steven Naismith, allowing Aiden McGeady to leave on loan and missing out on Sam Byram, he brought forward interest in Oumar Niasse and made the Lokomotiv Moscow striker one of the biggest transfers of the January window. The Senegal international provides another option to a team and manager in urgent need of a revival, while another promising forward, Shani Tarashaj, was secured ahead of a summer arrival. Andy Hunter Leicester City Ins Daniel Amartey (FC Copenhagen, \u00a35m), Demarai Gray (Birmingham City, \u00a33m), Daniel Iversen (Esbjerg, undisc.) Outs Andrej Kramaric (Hoffenheim, loan), Joe Davies (Fleetwood Town, undisc.), Alie Sesay (Barnet, undisc.), Jak McCourt (Barnsley, undisc.), Simonas Stankevicius (Zalgiris, undisc.), Tom Lawrence (Cardiff City, loan), Yohan Benalouane (Fiorentina, loan), Ritchie de Laet (Middlesbrough, loan) The coup of Leicester\u2019s transfer window, arguably, is the capacity to Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. Still, attack has been a priority \u2013 their pursuit of a new striker has been determined but difficult. The new recruits, Demarai Gray and Daniel Amartey, add depth and ability for the run-in and beyond. Amy Lawrence Liverpool Ins Marko Grujic (Red Star Belgrade, \u00a35,1m); Steven Caulker (Queens Park Rangers, loan), Kevin Stewart (Swindon, recalled from loan), Tiago Ilori (Aston Villa, recalled from loan) Outs Marko Grujic (Red Star Belgrade, loan); Ryan Fulton (Portsmouth, loan); Allan Rodrigues de Souza (Sint Truidense, loan) J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s first transfer window as Liverpool manager was frustrated by Shakhtar Donetsk\u2019s \u20ac70m valuation of Alex Teixeira and their insistence the Brazilian forward will not be sold until the summer. Interest in Schalke defender Joel Matip was also put on hold until the end of the season when the Cameroon international will be a free agent. There was success on Marko Grujic, however, with Liverpool beating Chelsea and Internazionale to a deal for Red Star Belgrade\u2019s highly-rated teenage playmaker. AH Manchester City Ins Anthony Caceres (Central Coast Mariners, undisc.) Outs Anthony Caceres (Melbourne City, loan), Patrick Roberts (Celtic, loan), George Evans (Reading, undisc.), Shay Facey (Rotherham United, loan), Ian Lawlor (Bury, loan), Bruno Zuculini (AEK Athens, loan) Made the signing of the window on deadline day (albeit not a player) when they announced Pep Guardiola would take over as their new manager. In regard to more traditional business they have made no new signings when at least one central defender would have been welcome, given Vincent Kompany\u2019s ongoing injury problems and the unreliable form of Eliaquim Mangala, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Martin Demichelis. Jamie Jackson Manchester United Ins Adnan Januzaj (Borussia Dortmund, recalled from loan) Outs Victor Vald\u00e9s (Standard Li\u00e8ge, loan), Ben Pearson (Preston North End, undisc.), Liam Grimshaw (Preston North End, undisc.), Dean Henderson (Stockport County, loan), Kieran O\u2019Hara (Morecambe, loan) Considering Louis van Gaal\u2019s travails this season Manchester United\u2019s stumbling campaign could have been kick-started by one or two headline signings \u2013 but there were none. So the manager\u2019s challenge now is to try and shepherd the players he has to secure a top-three finish and/or claim the FA Cup. If he does this it would constitute progress but whether it would save his job is a whole other debate. JJ Newcastle United Ins Seydou Doumbia (Roma, loan), Henri Saivet (Bordeaux, \u00a35m), Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City, \u00a312m), Andros Townsend (Tottenham Hotspur, \u00a312m) Outs Kyle Cameron (York City, loan), Mike Williamson (Wolves, undisc.), Lubo Satka (York City, loan), Florian Thauvin (Marseille, loan), Gael Bigirimana (Coventry City, loan), Shane Ferguson (Millwall, undisc.) High in the European spending charts but very low in the Premier League. And despite splashing all that cash the squad is still not properly balanced. At least the midfield \u2013 a big source of lots of problems \u2013 has been refreshed with Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s arrival a coup but major chinks in the defensive armour remain, while the attacking solution looks a bit of a temporary fix. Will Newcastle come to regret not signing Charlie Austin when they could have done? Or not buying Davide Santon back from Internazionale? Louise Taylor Norwich City Ins Patrick Bamford (Chelsea, loan), Steven Naismith (Everton, \u00a38.5m), Timm Klose (Wolfsburg, \u00a38.5m), Ben Godfrey (York City, undisc.), Ivo Pinto (Dinamo Zagreb, \u00a32.2m), Matt Jarvis (West Ham, \u00a32.5m), Ebou Adams (Dartford, undisc.), James Maddison (Coventry, undisc.) Outs Lewis Grabban (Bournemouth, \u00a37m,), Gary Hooper (Sheff Weds, undisc.), Jamar Loza (Southend, loan), Elliott Bennett (Blackburn, undisc.), Jake Kean (Colchester, loan), James Maddison (Coventry, loan) With his side two points above the bottom three, Alex Neil equalled Norwich\u2019s transfer record by signing Steven Naismith for \u00a38.5m and the former Everton forward scored on his debut against Liverpool, but that deal was offset by the \u00a37m sale of Lewis Grabban to Bournemouth. Having conceded 43 goals, Norwich also made defensive additions, signing Ivo Pinto from Dinamo Zagreb and Timm Klose from Wolfsburg. The 19-year-old midfielder James Maddison, a last-gasp signing from Coventry who will spend the rest of the season back on loan with the League One club, was highly coveted by big clubs and his addition could be a coup. Jacob Steinberg Southampton Ins Charlie Austin (Queens Park Rangers, \u00a34m) Outs Steven Caulker (QPR, loan ended), Sam McQueen (Southend, loan), Ryan Seager (Crewe Alexandra, loan), Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez (Middesbrough, loan) A positive window. The priority was to ensure that the predators did not lure away any of the club\u2019s stars, chiefly Sadio Man\u00e9 and Victor Wanyama and, also, to sign a centre-forward, so it was mission accomplished. There was not too much noise in the end around Man\u00e9 or Wanyama while Charlie Austin was a snip at \u00a34m. DH Stoke City Ins Giannelli Imbula (Porto, \u00a318.3m) Outs Steve Sidwell (Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, loan), Eddy Lecygne (Doncaster Rovers, loan), Marco van Ginkel (Chelsea, loan ended) Mark Hughes, after realising that Stoke would not be able to sign Saido Berahino from West Bromwich Albion, put all his transfer eggs into one basket with the arrival of Giannelli Imbula from Porto. His strategy paid dividends half an hour before the 11pm deadline, the highly-rated 23-year-old midfielder completing a club record deal worth \u00a318.3m. The Belgian-born Frenchman joined Porto in 2013, becoming the most expensive player to join a Portuguese club. Marcus Christenson Sunderland Ins Wahbi Khazri (Bordeaux, \u00a39m), Jan Kirchhoff (Bayern Munich, \u00a3750,000), Dame N\u2019Doye (Trabzonspor, loan), Steve Harper (free), Lamine Kon\u00e9 (Lorient, \u00a35m) Outs Costel Pantilimon (Watford, undisc.), Liam Bridcutt (Leeds United, loan), Will Buckley (Birmingham City, loan), Danny Graham (Blackburn, loan), Lynden Gooch (Doncaster, loan), Sebasti\u00e1n Coates (Sporting, loan), Christian Mavrias (Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, loan), Steven Fletcher (Marseille, loan), Jordi G\u00f3mez (Blackburn Rovers, loan) A slightly scattergun window which has raised more questions than answers on Wearside. Wahbi Khazri, Sunderland\u2019s \u00a39m Tunisia international, playmaking, buy from Bordeaux, is supposed to have much in common with Mesut \u00d6zil. Can his undoubted talent keep Sunderland up? Or will his infamous bad temper undermine things? Is Lamine Kon\u00e9, the new French \u00a35m centre-half, any good? Only time will tell. LT Swansea City Ins Alberto Paloschi (Chievo, \u00a38m), Leroy Fer (QPR, loan), Ryan Blair (Falkirk, undisc.) Outs Gerhard Tremmel (Werder Bremen, loan), Jonjo Shelvey (Newcastle United, \u00a312m), Franck Tabanou (St Etienne, loan), \u00c9der (Lille, loan), Daniel Alfei (Mansfield, loan) The most significant arrival was the Italian striker Alberto Paloschi, the Chievo forward who agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the club, having previously worked with coach Francesco Guidolin at Parma. Swansea did, though, allow Jonjo Shelvey to leave for Newcastle for \u00a312m, while Leroy Fer was a late loan addition from Championship side QPR. JR Tottenham Hotspur Ins Shilow Tracey (Ebbsfleet United, undisc.) Outs Andros Townsend (Newcastle United, \u00a312m, left), Kenny McEvoy (York City, undisc.), Alex Pritchard (West Bromwich Albion, loan), Shaq Coulthirst (Peterborough, undisc.), Federico Fazio (Sevilla, loan), Milos Veljkovic (Werder Bremen, undisc.) Tottenham are not historically associated with keeping their powder dry in the market but the Mauricio Pochettino era has been underpinned by calmness and precision. If there is nobody that he really wants, he is quite happy to sit tight. The belief he has in his players is admirable and galvanising. The reliance upon Harry Kane has some fans rather more nervous. DH Watford Ins Nordin Amrabat (M\u00e1laga, \u00a36.7m), Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 (Rennes, \u00a38m), Costel Pantilimon (Sunderland, undisc.), Mario Su\u00e1rez (Fiorentina, \u00a34m), Adalberto Pe\u00f1aranda (Udinese, undisc.) Outs Alessandro Diamanti (Atalanta, loan), Uche Ikpeazu (Blackpool, loan), Giedrius Arlauskis (Espanyol, loan), Connor Smith (released), Diego Fabbrini (Birmingham, undisc.), Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 (Granada, loan), Adalberto Pe\u00f1aranda (Granada, loan) Watford\u2019s league position meant they had no need to throw money around in January. They have, nevertheless, thrown money around, breaking their transfer record twice \u2013 phrases involving leopards and spots spring to mind \u2013 despite several failed pursuits. Still, the arrivals are obvious upgrades and Nordin Amrabat, who simultaneously offers pace, natural width and cover at centre-forward \u2013 all of which had previously been lacking \u2013 could be a key signing. Simon Burnton West Bromwich Albion Ins Sandro (Queens Park Rangers, loan), Alex Pritchard (Tottenham Hotspur, loan) Outs Anders Lindegaard (Preston North End, loan), Adil Nabi (Peterborough, undisc.) Tony Pulis spent more time criticising the existence of the window \u2013 \u201ca circus\u201d and \u201ca frenzy\u201d \u2013 than taking advantage of it. The club have been consistent in their disdain for the whole thing, and have now paid one transfer fee in the last four Januaries combined. A couple of midfielders arrived on loan, and after much frenzied speculation Saido Berahino, as promised, stayed put. SB West Ham United Ins Sam Byram (Leeds United, \u00a33.7m), Emmanuel Emenike (Fenerbahce, loan) Outs Matt Jarvis (Norwich City, \u00a32.5m), Diego Poyet (Charlton, loan), Lewis Page (Cambridge, loan), Elliot Lee (Colchester, loan), Mauro Z\u00e1rate (Fiorentina, \u00a31.6m), Stephen Hendrie (Southend, loan) West Ham were satisfied with their business, beating Everton to the signing of Sam Byram from Leeds United, completing a loan deal for Fenerbahce\u2019s Emmanuel Emenike and selling Mauro Z\u00e1rate to Fiorentina. Byram looks promising at right-back and Emenike, capped 37 times by Nigeria, bolsters Slaven Bilic\u2019s attacking options. Nikica Jelavic could move to China once Andy Carroll and Diafra Sakho regain fitness. JS"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
