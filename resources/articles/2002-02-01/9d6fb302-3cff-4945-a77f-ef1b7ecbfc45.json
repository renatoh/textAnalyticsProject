In December, authorities in Oldham were criticised for failing to address the deep-rooted segregation that led to some of the town's communities leading almost parallel lives. Today, the council insisted that integration could only be achieved if the people of Oldham wanted it. A partnership in the town, including the council and police, said it welcomed many of the 120 recommendations in an independent report but added: \"Nothing is possible without massive government funding.\" The Ritchie Report recommended a targeted programme of housing to promote racially-mixed schemes of private and socially rented housing. It warned that if the town failed to address segregation worse disturbances were inevitable. \"Segregation, albeit self-segregation, is an unacceptable basis for a harmonious community and it will lead to more serious problems if it is not tackled,\" the report warned. It also found that the council had been \"effective\" at bidding for government cash without thinking how the money could be used as part of an overall strategy, but councillors today insisted they needed extra funding. More than \u00a318m in government money was needed by the town each year to address problems of unfit housing and poor health in the borough, the council said. The leader of Oldham council, Richard Knowles, said it would cost the town around \u00a3270m to replace its 9,000 unfit houses. About \u00a39m a year of funding over 30 years was needed to clear the housing as suggested in the Ritchie Report, he said. Opposition leader David Jones added that a further \u00a39m a year would be needed to address the problems of \"unfair funding\" in the health services in the town - where mortality rates were \"among the worst in the country\". The town rejected outright criticisms in the report that it had lacked \"strategic direction and vision\" in the way it bid for government funding. None of this funding would be able to solve the town's problems without a new and fairer system of regeneration funding, it was claimed. In the past, the town had suffered through being forced to apply for funding for \"narrow geographical\" areas in the borough. Regeneration, which would be carried out by a new company set up as proposed in the Ritchie Report, would need to be borough-wide, the council said. \"Unlike the Oldham Independent Review which wanted a regeneration company to focus on a limited part of the borough ... (the council and the Local Strategic Partnership) believe the Regeneration company must cover the whole borough to create opportunities for all of us,\" the partnership said. \"Anything less would be divisive.\" Mr Ritchie had also supported plans for three of the town's faith schools to open up a fifth of their places to pupils of non-Christian backgrounds. Talks were under way with the diocese in the area to see whether the Church of England favoured such a move but the council was powerless to insist on such a plan, leaders said today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
