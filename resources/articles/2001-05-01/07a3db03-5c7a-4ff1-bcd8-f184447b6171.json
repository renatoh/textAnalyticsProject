Four managers and countless players have come and gone. But as the clubs prepare to meet again in the Cup final 30 years later, one link remains. Pat Rice, a 22-year-old right-back at Wembley in 1971, will be in Cardiff on Saturday as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's assistant. The Irishman admits the idea of two French managers leading out their teams for an FA Cup final in Wales would have seemed \"crazy\" to him three decades ago. He is not alone. Yet as a man about to experience his eighth FA Cup final as player or coach (three won and four lost) he knows the highs and lows remain. Thirty years ago today a hungover Rice paraded the league and Cup trophies from an open-top bus, with 250,000 people lining the streets from Highbury to Islington town hall. The journey ended with Arsenal being awarded the freedom of the borough, and another 2-1 win over Liverpool after extra-time would suit Rice fine. He could do without the desolation he felt in 1972 after losing 1-0 to Leeds in the final. \"I was coming back from the hotel and went through Islington and I was thinking, 'You've let all these people down',\" he said. \"You see all the colours all over the place, so when you win the Cup it's a matter of pride. You feel as though you've done it for the fans.\" The Highbury fans love Rice, whom Wenger calls \"pure Arsenal\". For years he lived round the corner from the ground. From apprentice he rose to captain, making almost 400 league appearances and becoming the only player to appear in five Cup finals for the same side. In 1979 he lifted the trophy after victory over Manchester United. After a spell at Watford Rice returned as youth coach in 1984 and rose to No2 in 1996 after Wenger's appointment. He is not the only 1971 survivor at Arsenal - Bob Wilson is a goalkeeping coach and Don Howe, part of Bertie Mee's staff, is head youth coach - but he is the most senior. Memories of the last Arsenal v Liverpool final burn bright. Five days earlier the title had been won at Tottenham, and at Wembley Arsenal fell behind early in extra-time, recovering to win through Charlie George's thumping drive. \"It was blisteringly hot,\" said Rice. \"When they scored I felt so deflated. I thought the Double had gone, especially feeling the way I did because I was really tired. But Frank McLintock picked the team up as captain.\" An equaliser soon followed. Eddie Kelly touched the ball forward, George Graham swung and missed and Ray Clemence was unable to prevent it crossing the line. Then George struck from 20 yards and fell to the floor, arms outstretched. \"If you ask Frank he'll say Charlie had the strength because he'd done sod all in the match,\" Rice said. Rice's joy may have been accentuated by the knowledge that he had been beaten by Steve Heighway before the winger, now Liverpool's academy director, fired a shot inside Wilson's near post to put Arsenal behind. Given that it was his 70th game of the season, Rice was entitled to a lapse. \"The pace of the game wasn't what it is now,\" he said, explaining why 70 games is unthinkable these days. \"Watch the old footage. Someone picks the ball up and it's about 10 minutes before anyone challenges.\" Rice was Mr Dependable, which is doubtless how Wenger sees him, and the respect Rice has for his manager is plain. \"You can ask him about any player in the world and he'll tell you all about him, which is amazing,\" Rice said. \"And he never seems to get flustered.\" Only at half-time of February's 6-1 defeat at Old Trafford, when Arsenal were 5-1 down, has he seen Wenger shout. \"That's the only time I've seen him really, really have a go,\" he said. \"It was about pride.\" The same feeling Rice had on the bus after beating Liverpool 30 years ago. And a feeling he wants again on Saturday night. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
