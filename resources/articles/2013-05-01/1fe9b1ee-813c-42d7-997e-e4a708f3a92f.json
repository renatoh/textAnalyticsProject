It's a smaller, balcony-above-bar type place, the bonus being that the next- door bar (called BarBar) is nearby in case the in-studio bartender gets backed up. Live music on a national-talent level for $10? You got it. This is a place to get those ears properly spoiled. Live music for this price elsewhere will just leave you sad, and maybe a little bitter about life. One quirky/awesome booking option is to rent out the upstairs, which is a well-designed spacious apartment, and make your concert a mini vacation. \u2022 3939 North Mississippi Avenue, +1 503 288 3895, mississippistudios.com. To rent the apartment visit airbnb.com. Check listings for details Aladdin Theater The most grown-up of all the rock venues in Portland, boasting the least reverb in town, the Aladdin is largely a sit-down place featuring indie rock staples, but also major players. It is home to a weekly local public radio show, with a live studio audience (cat-calls welcomed). Located on the east side, this classic spot feels like it's an old live theatre, with a dose of vaudeville sparkle. If you're in the mood for some post-show chow, the Original Hotcake House (1002 Southeast Powell Boulevard) just around the corner will gain you five pounds in weight in a single portion \u2013 and it's open 24 hours. \u2022 3017 SE Milwaukie Avenue, +1 503 234 9694, aladdin-theater.com. Check listings for details Holocene Portland's original electro-dance club, Holocene has filled a void in the Portland music scene, once awash in indie rock and top 40 dance clubs. With jam-packed DJ shows and electronic gigs, Holocene has taken its place as one of the city's premier dance-type venues. Founded by a pair of San Francisco transplants looking to recreate the magic they experienced in their home city, and abroad in Berlin, Holocene has made their dream come true. Check out its theme-based events calendar: something will grab you. \u2022 1001 SE Morrison Street, +1 503 239 7639, holocene.org. Hours vary, but generally Wed-Thurs, Sat 8.30pm-till late, Fri 5pm-till late, Sun-Tues check listings for details Rontom's With its sprawling interior seating area and one of the best back porches for nursing a beer on a warm Oregon evening, Rontom's is more bar than music venue. However, on Sunday nights its free live music showcases are stellar. Leaving no genre unexplored, Rontom's delivers some of the best local music Portland has to offer: from old standbys to groups you've never heard of, but should be talking about. Grab a drink from the bar (the table service is historically slow, and it's not really that charming) and head out to the deck, where you can play a few games of tipsy ping pong before the show starts. \u2022 600 East Burnside Street, +1 503 236 4536, rontoms.net. Check local listings for details The Know Can't get enough metal? Punk runs in your bloodstream? Want to eat a $1 White Castle burger while playing a 25\u00a2 pinball game? Walk right in to The Know and blast your ears out with this hidden treasure of a dive experience. The Alberta neighbourhood scene is diverse, this place is pretty straightforward: it's cheap, it's anarchist-style punk and metal, and you're probably gonna feel weird your first time here. Leave Aunt Louise at her hotel and go get some culture at this hole in the ground. \u2022 2026 NE Alberta Street, +1 503 473 8729, theknowpdx.com. Open daily 3pm till 2.30am Doug Fir Lounge There are few better places in Portland to grab a pre-show drink, near one of several fire pits, than this place, famous for its space-age log cabin interior. Once you've warmed up by the fire (because summer nights are still cold in Oregon \u2013 yes, it's disappointing) head downstairs to the intimate venue space that features some of the best sounds in the city and many of the best touring acts in Portland. By now you realise this place is the best! The small space and two-level layout ensures that you're never far from the act. If you're completely sauced and refuse to take a taxi, you can spend the night in the Jupiter Hotel next door. More vertical integration! And guess what \u2013 the Doug Fir serves breakfast. \u2022 830 East Burnside Street +1 503 231 9663, dougfirlounge.com. Open daily 7am-2.30am Edgefield Edgefield is Portland's largest outdoor venue, featuring many of the most popular acts that come through town, and is definitely one of the best places to see a show in summer. Owned by brew pub craft-beer megalith McMenamins, Edgefield is a sprawling plantation with restaurants, a hotel, a distillery and a golf course. Grab one of McMenamins' many great house-brewed beers and a burger, head out to the secluded field concert space and sprawl like you have no shame. While this is a great venue to see a show, be aware that it's a half an hour drive outside the city centre. Rooms are available (doubles from $70 plus tax), in case you act irresponsibly. Before you book, you should also know this historic venue is haunted. Sweet dreams. Door open or closed? \u2022 2126 SW Halsey Street, Troutdale, +1 503 669 8610, mcmenamins.com. Check listings for details Zoo Amphitheater It's an unlikely pick, but if planned properly, a concert on a lawn with Asian elephants at your back can be a magical evening out. Plus, the generic farm-ripe smell of the animal kingdom makes for unbeatable ambiance. It's not much more than a grassy knoll amphitheater: you'll need to bring a blanket or a chair, and perhaps sneak in your own booze. A no-name bottle of wine will cost you $30 here, so most patrons bring their own mini picnics and make an evening of it. Show up early: parking and spot-nabbing is a blood sport, and those concert moms have no mercy! Top acts such as Ziggy Marley, Jewel, KD Lang, and the B-52s circulate from June through September. Great for families, but not those families offended by whiffs of a special herb wafting across the lawn. This is Oregon after all. \u2022 4001 SW Canyon Road, +1 503 226 1561, zooconcerts.com. Check listings for details Valentines Tucked away \u2013 no, really, this place is hard to find \u2013 on SW Ankeny Street, Valentines feels like a speakeasy. Totally under the radar, and seating maybe 40 people, it's a place where the live music really gets your ear drums excited, so don't expect to talk to friends during a set. Dinner is great, but the drinks are better. Expert staff and a small hideaway upstairs make this place a return-worthy venue, best with a small group. If it's packed though, you can hang out in the alley, under Italian garden lights on original cobblestone, in the shadow of one of two Portland high-rises. You'll probably be munching on a Voodoo Doughnut, since its front door is right in front of your face. \u2022 232 SW Ankeny Street, +1 503 248 1600, valentinespdx.com. Open daily 5pm-2.30am Crystal Ballroom Before we get angry emails for listing this venue, we do know it's not the best sound quality. This venue was not built for live music; it's a ballroom. Yes, the rumours are true: the wooden floor bounces with the people, giving the sensation of dancing on air. That's nice, but what's amazing about this place is all that it has been. It's like Portland herself. Top talent rolls through though, and it has a rich \u2013 if not sometimes grossly weird \u2013 gritty history. These days it hosts all-ages live shows, 1980s dance nights and expensive craft beer. Everyone gets along. Just like Portland. When the music starts, they're just Oregonians, and that's why this venue is important. You get a cross section here other venues can't touch. A sushi roll of humanity, if you will. \u2022 1332 West Burnside Street, +1 503 225 0047, mcmenamins.com.
