We are past being astonished and horrified. We are done with futile complaint. We are just numbly resigned to the great man continuing to do things like this, vaguely hoping that through sheer productivity he will have a \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d moment and pull something out of the bag. Dirty Grandpa isn\u2019t that something \u2013 but there are a few gags here, and though De Niro\u2019s ability to play comedy is always debatable, he is more relaxed than we\u2019ve seen him in a while. The persona here is creepily comparable to his role in the romcom The Intern: the grandpa figure whose life (including his sex life) opens up after he becomes a widower. Following his wife\u2019s funeral, De Niro asks his uptight grandson (Zac Efron) if he will drive him to Florida, and it becomes horribly clear that the old guy is now an outrageous born-again bachelor who yearns to make it with bikini-clad women there on Daytona Beach for spring break. Zac actually catches his grandpa watching porn and having a \u201cnumber three\u201d. (I was reminded of Tibor Fischer saying that the spectacle of Martin Amis\u2019s decline was like seeing your favourite uncle in the school playground, masturbating.) Some laughs \u2013 and some unintentional eeeuuuwwws."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
