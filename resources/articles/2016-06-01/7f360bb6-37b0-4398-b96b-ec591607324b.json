Guardiola decided to contact Sterling after hearing that one of the players he will be inheriting at Manchester City next season might be suffering because of the sustained abuse he has attracted since his acrimonious departure from Liverpool last July. What is not commonly known about Sterling\u2019s transfer to City is that Guardiola in effect sanctioned the deal even though he was working at the time as Bayern Munich manager. Guardiola had already been lined up to replace Manuel Pellegrini and City\u2019s owners are understood to have consulted him before making Sterling the most expensive English player in history. Guardiola, who had also considered recruiting Sterling for Bayern, made his admiration clear during a lengthy telephone conversation with the player before England\u2019s goalless draw against Slovakia, when the 21-year-old was left out of the side on the back of two erratic performances in the opening Group B fixtures against Russia and Wales. Guardiola explained it was important to block out negative thinking and encouraged Sterling to remember the qualities that had made him one of the outstanding young players in English football. He also made it clear he was looking forward to working with Sterling in Manchester next season. \u201cAs long as you work for me, I\u2019ll fight for you,\u201d Guardiola told his player. \u201cKeep your head up, don\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019re a good player and you are a big part of my plans.\u201d Sterling is not expected to return to the side for England\u2019s game against Iceland in Nice on Monday, with Hodgson\u2019s initial thoughts centred around a front three that would have Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana either side of the recalled Harry Kane, with Jamie Vardy also likely to miss out. Lallana limped out of England\u2019s latest training session after twisting his ankle but an ice pack reduced the swelling and the problem is not serious. That leaves Sterling facing another game out of the team but he is said to have been lifted by Guardiola\u2019s intervention and the timing could yet have benefits for Hodgson if it helps the player to rediscover the form that persuaded City to pay an initial \u00a344m, potentially rising to \u00a349m with add-ons. While Hodgson has insisted Sterling has been \u201cbright as a button in training\u201d, there have been concerns among England\u2019s management about the player\u2019s deterioration in form and whether his sell-belief might have been damaged by the criticism he tends to attract. After England\u2019s opening game against Russia, Sterling posted a picture on Instagram of Marseille\u2019s Stade V\u00e9lodrome with the message \u201c#TheHatedOne\u201d. He is known to pay more attention to social media than some people in the England camp believe is healthy, particularly bearing in mind the abuse he often receives on Twitter, and he is one of the players at England\u2019s base in Chantilly who has been having sessions with the squad\u2019s sports psychiatrist, Dr Steve Peters, having worked with him previously at Liverpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
