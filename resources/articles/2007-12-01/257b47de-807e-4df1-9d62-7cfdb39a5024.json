It's instant, on tap, almost enforced. The past is omnipresent on our TV screens. Barely a night passes without revisiting the matches of the 90s (invariably Liverpool's 4-3 victories over Newcastle) or the 80s (Liverpool, Liverpool, Liverpool) or 70s (yet more Liverpool, with a few party pieces from gorgeous wastrels like Stan Bowles and Tony Currie). If you're not satisfied by the telly, you can time-travel on YouTube. Most of my childhood memories are still lodged in my head. Not only can I still see the 40-yard screamer Colin Bell scored against Burnley when the cameras weren't there, I can hear it. It gets better every time I replay it. Denis Tueart's three overhead-kick goals in 1976 couldn't be more vivid if I'd just seen them on HDTV. We had to take older memories on trust. The furthest television footage went back was to grainy old FA Cup finals where you could only see the horses. I knew Billy Meredith had been a great Man City and Wales captain because I'd been told so many times. Duncan Edwards, the greatest player of his day? Of course he was. Everybody said so. We heard so much about these legends it felt as if we had seen them. When players retired they went to run their pubs and we didn't hear of them again till they died, too often of cirrhosis of the liver. Obituaries would print pictures of them in their prime. I don't have a clue how many of my old favourites aged because once they hung up their boots they disappeared - King Colin, Kenny Clements, who could never do kick-ups, and the supreme centre-back Dave Watson are Dorian Grays, forever fixed in their twenties. If they had retired a decade later they'd be growing old with us. We'd be monitoring their incipient paunches, double chins and receding hairlines on quiz shows and on Sky, where they'd be giggling their way through match reports from the warmth of Jeff Stelling's studio. We'd see them trotting out for televised veterans' competitions such as the Masters. We marvel at how Alan Hansen has kept his looks, how Gary Lineker is still boyish despite the white hair, how Andy Gray could have ever been a footballer in the first place, let alone a very good one. At the Masters, we can see how the great whales have added an extra layer of blubber (take a bow Neville Southall and Micky Quinn) and who is flourishing in middle age (David Oldfield and Owen Coyle, never great stars in their day, are having a fantastic renaissance, winning the title for Leicester City a few weeks ago.) They are all part of the extended family; living-room regulars. It's not just football. \"Beefy\" Botham and \"Lamby\" Lamb are perhaps now better known to children for encouraging us to eat beefy and lamby than for playing cricket. It's comforting, in a way - however lonely we might be we need not grow old alone. But it's also ghoulish. Watching our heroes age is a constant reminder of mortality, and all this instant accessing of the past robs us of true memories (see or hear something often enough and it loses its special quality - remember what the Levi's ad did for I Heard It Through the Grapevine) while relieving us of the present. We're too busy reliving the past. Me, I'm a sucker for it. It's all too easy to lie on the sofa, flick the remote and lock myself into yesteryear. Before long I'll be scoffing madeleines by the dozen and quoting Proust in my sleep. On Sunday I couldn't keep myself from England Legends v Rest of the World. More comfort food - it proved I'm not the only one slowing down. But there was also a truly uplifting sight. For seven years Gianfranco Zola graced the English game. And here he was, at 41, doing the same. If ever there was a footballer who played with soul and generosity of spirit it was the Italian, who skinned defenders with kindness, nutmegged them with love. It's too easy to say he represents a lost age. He doesn't. Zola was always a one-off. At the end of Sunday's match, after leading the Rest of the World to victory and playing everybody else off the park, he held hands with the children and signed every last autograph. He said that he was now coaching and one day he hoped to be good enough to return to the English game. Such humility from a footballer! Zola is not just an ambassador for football, he is an ambassador for the human race. Yes, he looks older and his hair is thinner, but his face is more luminous than ever.
