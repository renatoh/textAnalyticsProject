Clinical trials that tested the memories of healthy, young adults found that those who had taken sage oil capsules performed significantly better in a word recall test. The findings will inform drug research and development into Alzheimer's disease. Scientists from the Medicinal Plant Research Centre (MPRC) at the universities of Newcastle and Northumbria have provided the first scientific evidence to back centuries old claims. The team was inspired by tests conducted by herbalists as far back as the 16th century. One such herbalist, John Gerard, wrote in 1597, that sage was \"singularly good for the head and brain and quickeneth the nerves and memory\". In 1652, Nicholas Culpeper, wrote: \"It also heals the memory, warming and quickening the senses.\" The leading researcher on the MPRC team, Nicola Tildesley, said: \"This proves how valuable the work by the old herbalists is, and that they shouldn't just be ignored because they were writing centuries ago.\" But she told people who were taking exams not to get too excited by the findings. \"Test would need to be carried out on people over a longer period of time to prove that sage improves exam performance, but we don't have any plans to do this at present.\" Researchers tested 44 healthy young adults aged between 18 and 37. Some were given capsules containing sage oil and others were given placebos. The volunteers then took part in a word recall test and tested at intervals to see how many words they could remember. Results showed that those who had taken the sage oil consistently performed better than those who had taken placebos. Sage is being investigated as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease after earlier research by the MPRC found that it inhibits an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which breaks down the chemical messenger acetylcholine. Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia which affects an estimated 10 million people worldwide, is accompanied by a drop in acetylcholine. Many of the drugs currently available to help slow the progress of Alzheimer's, such as Donepezil, have unpleasant side effects and doctors are keen to find alternatives. No side effects were noted in the sage trial. The results of the study are published in the current edition of the academic journal Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behaviour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
