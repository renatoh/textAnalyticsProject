For some reason, the stand-up comedian, grimly fretting on stage before a restive audience, has been turned into a figure of grand metaphorical significance. In fact, Gordon Burn's carefully researched third novel, though it features the standard ageing patter-merchant, stands at one remove from this burgeoning sub-genre. For one thing, hardly any of it takes place on stage, there are no musings on the nature of comedy, and throughout, Burn's eye rests squarely on the landscapes his characters inhabit rather than the people themselves. The North of England Home Service opens in a northeastern suburb whose outlying rural edge is succumbing to the fiats of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. Open space is being cordoned off; the reek of burnt carcasses hangs in the air. All this is crisply observed, from his bedroom window and the heath where he sedulously jogs, by Ray Cruddas, former ornament of stage, screen and pier-end, lately returned to his childhood stamping-ground. Prudently taking care of his health, married to an \u00e9migr\u00e9e Pole plucked from the staff of his dead mother's retirement home, Ray and his career have been mildly rejuvenated. Backed by a local Mr Big, celebrity greeter at the local football club, he also functions as manager and star attraction of the nightspot of the title, an ingenious light-entertainment heritage centre whose patrons turn up dressed in cloth caps and Aertex turbans to dine, elegiacally, off cow-heel brawn and stotty cake. Having paused to introduce its second element - Jackie McCabe, a 70-year-old former boxer, and Ray's long-term factotum-cum-minder - the novel sets off on what, transparently, is its real mission: a lavish recreation of the postwar landscapes in which Ray (likely lad starting his career on the boards of the old variety halls) and Jackie (prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the real-life boxing promoter Jack Solomons) forged their alliance. What follows is, on the one hand, a panorama of postwar English social history - the showgirls pattering across the clotted Soho alleys in their high heels, Jackie matched against Charlie Kray on an Albert Hall undercard, Solomons roaming in search of talent among the immigrant hordes set down at Tilbury - and, on the other, a treatment that occasionally leaves the demands of fiction trailing in its wake. Gordon Burn has another literary career, of course, as a dazzling chronicler of real lives: his recreation of the dense north country world that spawned Peter Sutcliffe in Somebody's Husband, Somebody's Son was an exemplary piece of true- crime reportage. The North of England Home Service's most ingrained characteristic, ominously enough, is its habit of descending into sheer socio-historical commentary rather than welding the world evoked to the narrative. One notices this as early as the rapt opening descriptions of the reinvented mining village that Ray wanders through, where superannuated pit boots do service as flower-pots and miners' helmets have been prettified into garden ornaments. But it is most apparent in some of the minor walk-ons, which Burn sets down with the precision of a film-set costume designer. \"He wore his thinning hair in a pony-tail-with-scrunchie with two fuzzy brackets of hair, which turned into lank hasidim-like ringlets in the wet heat, framing his ears,\" Burn writes of Ray's club chef - meticulous to be sure, but rather overdoing it for a bit-parter who features for little more than a page. Delicately written, with all the eye-catching detail that gives Burn's non-fiction its allure, the result is rather short on human interaction. By far the best scenes (the sinister, coke-snorting larks in Mr Big's office, Jackie cycling the 70 miles from Hackney back to his home in the Cambridgeshire fens in the big freeze of 1947) come when the historical fog recedes for a moment to allow Ray and Jackie to stumble hesitantly into the light. Although there is a neat drawing together of threads when Jackie jeopardises Ray's career by thumping Mr Big in the football club executive lounge, you wonder in the end whether Burn has chosen quite the right vehicle for this arresting study of two people acclimatising themselves to the sharp winds of social change. One picks up a novel, after all, in the confident expectation that something will happen. Too much of the action here seems already to have taken place.
