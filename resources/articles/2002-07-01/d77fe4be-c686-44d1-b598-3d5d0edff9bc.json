Yorkshire were fighting to avoid the follow-on - they still need 91 - and defeat here yesterday when Richard Blakey hit a sweet cover drive. The fielder had given up on it when the ball struck a pigeon. Only one was scored. It has been that sort of season for Yorkshire. The arrival of rain, however, helped their chances of saving this game when a 22-over chunk was taken out of the middle of the day. Somerset, though, had displayed altogether more purpose in the field than their opponents. Matthew Bulbeck showed the Yorkshire bowlers how to swing the ball and the spinners Keith Dutch and Ian Blackwell bowled better on a slow turner than their counterparts, though yesterday the pitch was slightly quicker. Yorkshire resumed on 46 for one and with the last ball of the first over Craig White, shouldering arms, had his left stump taken out by Bulbeck. Somerset then missed a chance to take a firm grip on the match when Peter Bowler put down Darren Lehmann at slip off Graham Rose. The Yorkshire captain had scored only 11 at the time. Yorkshire, chasing 349 to avoid the follow-on, lost their third wicket at 89 when Anthony McGrath was bowled, off stump, driving at a swinging, full-length delivery from the impressive Bulbeck. Lehmann, in particular, took the attack to the Somerset bowlers, cashing in on his reprieve to strike a succession of fluent boundaries. But when he had scored 64 he got his bat caught in his front pad as he played to leg and, with a leading edge, gave Dutch a simple return catch. Two of Yorkshire's hopes for a better future, Michael Lumb and Vic Craven, now came together in a fifth-wicket stand of 80. Lumb reached his fifty from his 121st delivery when he eased Blackwell through the covers for four. But seven runs later he was out lbw to the same bowler. Craven also reached his half-century. There were six fours and a six over long-off, but his impressive innings came to a disappointing end. Reaching for a wide delivery outside off stump, he edged Bulbeck to Dutch at second slip and was out for 51."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
