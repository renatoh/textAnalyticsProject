The Labour and Conservative party leaders will face each other in the debate on ITV, chaired by presenter Julie Etchingham. Corbyn had challenged Johnson to a debate earlier in the week and on Friday said it was \u201cwelcome\u201d that the offer had been accepted. \u201cThe choice could not be clearer: Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives protecting the privileged few or a Labour government on the side of the many,\u201d Corbyn tweeted on Friday. Johnson tweeted: \u201cLooking forward to making the positive case to the country that we should get Brexit done and deliver on the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 our NHS, schools, tackling crime and the cost of living.\u201d The Liberal Democrats said it was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d on how to respond, and accused both party leaders of \u201crunning scared\u201d from Jo Swinson. \u201cThey appear determined to block the woman leader of the strongest party of remain from the debate stage,\u201d said a Lib Dem spokesperson. ITV has said it will run a live interview-based programme later on Tuesday evening in which other parties will have the opportunity to comment on the head-to-head debate and set out their own electoral agenda. This will feature the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, the Brexit party, SNP and the Green party. ITV will also offer the Lib Dems, the SNP, the Brexit party, Plaid Cymru, as well as Labour and the Tories, another opportunity to take part in a second debate \u2013 between their party leaders or another senior figure \u2013 which it will host at a later date. Separate debates will be held for Northern Ireland and Wales. STV, which broadcasts to parts of Scotland, plans to hold its own debate between Scottish candidates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
