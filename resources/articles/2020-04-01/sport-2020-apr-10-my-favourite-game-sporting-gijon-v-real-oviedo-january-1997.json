Turned out Jaime was right. When a small group of us said we were going to the Asturian derby between Sporting Gij\u00f3n and Real Oviedo, his response was to buy a hard hat. We hadn\u2019t and we were exposed. Not that we were the only ones. Not all of the thousand or so fans travelling there wore helmets but there might have been a couple of hundred when they arrived at the station in Oviedo that afternoon. In the mind\u2019s eye it is more, and a lot of them are covered with football stickers. Looking back, that derby might not even be a good thing, something to hang on to, still less to celebrate, but it doesn\u2019t go away. First, an apology: the headline in La Nueva Espa\u00f1a that morning called it the \u201cgreatest show on earth, more than a match\u201d, but in fact it wasn\u2019t much of a match at all, still less a great game, confirmation of what one report called a \u201ctendency to nil-nilism\u201d. Well, they did say favourite and this did come to mind, a memory crystallising in that piece of sartorial advice and the essential silliness of it all. This was huge, friends in Oviedo had said. Rooting out the reports now says so too. The match preview opened with the line \u201cat last the day arrives\u201d. That day was a Sunday in January 1997 and they loaded us \u2013 too many of us \u2013 on to a train to Gij\u00f3n, 35km away. A football special, no one else on board and no other way to go. Packed in and unable to move, glasses of piss passed along precariously and chucked out of the window. Songs hammered out on the ceiling and the sides, even if we didn\u2019t know all of the words. As we got closer to Gij\u00f3n, some Sporting fans waited on the platforms of stations the train sped through \u2013 Veri\u00f1a and La Calzada at a guess, looking at the map 23 years later \u2013 and threw things, thudding against the side. It pulled into Gij\u00f3n and the police boxed us in on all sides and ran us to the stadium all along the beachfront, three kilometres covered quickly. A few rocks flew, a bottle or two, hence the helmets, yet mostly it was insults and not much else \u2013 most tongue in cheek, accepted and reciprocated. They welcomed us and we proposed a swap deal for the UK: Gibraltar for Gij\u00f3n. They never did take us up on that. We kept running, all the way to the Molin\u00f3n, where the mayor of Oviedo said the city\u2019s team played \u201cbeautifully\u201d. He insisted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t football, this is poetry.\u201d He was only half right, another politician telling porkies, and six years on Oviedo fans had more reason to hate him than anyone in Gij\u00f3n when he proposed to put the club out of business and they rose up to rescue it. Yet if anyone deserved anything that day it probably was Oviedo. Managed by Juanma Lillo, they had two goals disallowed and a penalty turned down in the 0-0 draw. Peter Dubovsky, rest his soul, hit the bar. Lillo wasn\u2019t happy about the ref but he doesn\u2019t linger in my mental version, which is more in line with the match ratings for the two keepers: \u201cAblanedo: not a game with much work.\u201d And \u201cMora: more relaxed than he could have imagined.\u201d In fact, the game almost doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 beating double-winning Atl\u00e9tico 4-1 that year, now that was a game \u2013 but nor does it matter. It was the experience, the discovery, the something. The president of the principality admitted that there \u201chadn\u2019t been much football\u201d. It had, though, \u201cbeen a great party\u201d, and now there was a train to catch home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
