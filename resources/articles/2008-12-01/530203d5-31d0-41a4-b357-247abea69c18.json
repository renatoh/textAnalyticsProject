Peter Horrocks, the head of the BBC's newsroom, said today that more pre-broadcast checks should have been carried out on the report, which was based on an account by a corporation correspondent who was at Delhi's main international airport. An unnamed BBC news correspondent, who was caught up in a security alert at the airport sparked by reports of gunshots, reported that he was told by staff that six gunmen had been killed. The report was first aired at 8.10pm yesterday night on the BBC News channel and was subsequently carried on the global BBC World News service and the BBC News website. Following denials by the Indian authorities, the BBC withdrew the claim. Horrocks said today that the BBC went too far in broadcasting the uncorroborated reports. \"Following urgent checks by BBC News teams and denials by the Indian authorities we subsequently and rapidly reported that six gunmen had not been killed,\" he wrote on the BBC News website editors' blog. \"The security alert had apparently been sparked by a false alarm. We made clear in the online story that our earlier report had been wrong and this remained in the story subsequently. \"Clearly we shouldn't have given the reports the weight that we did, and I regret that we did so. \"At the time we believed them to be correct on the basis of the information received by a BBC reporter on the ground but it is clear that we should have continued with further checks before going as far as we did.\" Tensions have been high in India since last week's terrorist attack in Mumbai left nearly 200 people dead. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
