A collection of MPs - including women, warlords and Taliban defectors - crammed into the renovated national assembly for a simple ceremony. \"We should stand bravely before the world to say we have emerged from war,\" said President Hamid Karzai, tears welling up in his eyes. \"This homeland will live forever!\" The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, and his wife, Lynne, listened silently in the front row. Elections in Afghanistan and Iraq would be \"an inspiration to democratic reformers in other lands\", he later told troops at Bagram airbase. But optimism was tempered with disappointment that so many strongmen, some accused of war crimes, had been allowed to run for office. Sharif Zurmati, a TV newsreader turned politician, said the inauguration stirred mixed emotions. \"I was happy but then I looked at the people I was sitting with - the same ones who committed crimes, shed much blood, made women into widows and children into orphans. I am very worried they will start a second war.\" Abdul Rasul Sayaaf, a once powerful mujahideen commander now running for speaker, denied accusations that his supporters had offered bribes for votes. \"Our people have not interfered,\" he said. Mr Sayaaf warily welcomed plans for a truth and justice commission to examine past abuses. \"All of us want to see justice being implemented but after proper research, not the wishes of a small number of people,\" he said. King Zahir Shah, 91, who presided over the last parliament until being overthrown in 1973, opened the inauguration. Mr Karzai repeated pleas for an end to the booming drugs trade. At least 20 parliamentarians are directly involved in drugs smuggling, according to diplomats. Tellingly, MPs clapped when he said neighbouring countries \"should not interfere in our affairs\". Many Afghans blame Pakistan for a sharp resurgence in Taliban violence that has rocked southern provinces in recent months. A Taliban suicide bomb exploded near the parliament last Friday, intensifying a citywide lockdown from dawn yesterday. After Mr Cheney entered the parliament chaotic scenes erupted when Afghan security guards insisted on searching the Americans' bags - including a briefcase containing America's secret nuclear bomb codes. An angry White House official ordered the guards to \"open the gate now\", an AP reporter said. \"These are the vice-president's military aides.\" The Afghans, who were trained by the US security contractor Dyncorps, allowed the aides through but insisted on a thorough body search of the rest of the party. The new parliament starts work this morning. One of its first tasks will be to approve Mr Karzai's cabinet - a prospect likely to prompt a reshuffle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
