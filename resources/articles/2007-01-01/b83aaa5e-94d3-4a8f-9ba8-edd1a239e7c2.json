However, to assert that only the most able can cope at GCSE level is not going to help the majority of Latin teachers, who struggle each year to attract enough students for a viable GCSE set. A revision of the GCSE specification is due soon. The assessment of literature in the original Latin (including its social context) should remain an essential element, but can be tested in more imaginative ways. Understanding and evaluation (high-level skills) can loom larger than memory with the help of open-book access, translation assistance, controlled classroom assignments etc. This will hardly lead to a dumbing-down of a subject that is among the hardest of all GCSEs, and might even attract more students for whom a grade F or G would be a triumph. The subject might be difficilis but its examination does not need to be difficilior. Alan Clague Thatcham, Berkshire Mary Beard rightly points out that Latin is not socially elitist. However, the educational system seems also to have followed an idea of \"usefulness\" in choosing to \"ease Latin out\". In our technological and scientific culture, Latin provides a non-quantifiable and non-applicable knowledge that is therefore deemed of no use. But who decides what knowledge is useful? Latin and ancient Greek are essential in developing logical and critical thinking, and knowledge can only be advanced by those who can think. It is thus regrettable to see that the educational establishment is more interested in forming individuals to be useful to society rather than in aiding individuals to be free and thus model society. Francesca Montemaggi Cardiff The difficulty of learning Latin lies not in the language but in the choice of writers prematurely presented to students. Latin is no more difficult that other inflected languages, such as German. Mary Beard admits that Tacitus, writing for specifically rhetoric-trained native Latin speakers, is \"difficult, complex and highly literary\". There is plenty of less esoteric Latin writing from classical times, such as Aulus Gellius or chatty letters from Hadrian's Wall. But more Latin has been fluently written since the Romans than during their time, such as our British Bede and More, and it is more accessible and relevant to any students. Brian Bishop Leigh-on-Sea, Essex Other than the cultural motives given by Mary Beard for encouraging the study of Latin, there is a further, practical reason for so doing. It provides an excellent basis for learning the modern Latin-based languages - Catalan, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish - spoken as a mother tongue by well over 600 million people.
