The Bedford runner, who is to contest the 10,000 metres and marathon, was tested in Loughborough last week as part of the IAAF's plan to conduct a record 850 tests, more than double the number it carried out at the championships in Paris two years ago. Radcliffe, like those ranked in the world's top 20 of their events, was an automatic candidate to be screened before the championships start. The world record holder for the women's marathon is a strong advocate of blood testing. The red ribbon Radcliffe wears when competing is to signify her willingness to be tested and in that she is backed by several other leading athletes, most notably Morocco's double Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj. If a problem is detected with blood screened at a special facility at the athletes' village in Espoo this week, a urine sample will be taken for a more comprehensive analysis. Virtually half the competitors will be tested during the championships, as they arrive at the village and during the games themselves, when close to 500 samples will be collected - more than 50 for every day of the meeting. A further 100 blood tests will also be carried out during competition. \"The IAAF is determined to ensure these championships highlight our ongoing aggressive commitment to the war on doping,\" said the IAAF president Lamine Diack. \"In cooperation with the Finnish Anti-Doping Agency we plan to have the most ambitious and comprehensive system of testing ever activated at a world championships. We have increased the testing before, during and after the competition and we will also focus our efforts on education.\" The most notable of the athletes caught in the 2003 championships in Paris was Kelli White, the winner of the 100 and 200m. The American tested positive for modanafil, a drug she claimed had been prescribed to treat the sleeping disorder narcolepsy. It was the start of a saga involving the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative that has enveloped athletics, baseball and American Football in the biggest scandal ever to engulf sport. The Finnish organisers, meanwhile, angry at suggestions that they have sold barely 50% of the tickets for these championships, claim that they have experienced a last-minute surge in demand. \"As at July 31 2005 - 75% to 90% of all morning sessions [based on 40,000 full capacity] and 82% to 100% of all evening sessions have been sold,\" said Antti Pihlakoski, chief executive of the local organising committee. \"We want to organise a world championships with a unique, warm and entertaining spirit, making Helsinki a cherished memory.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
