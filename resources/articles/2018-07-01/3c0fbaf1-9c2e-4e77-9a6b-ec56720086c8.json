With Bill Shorten desperate to hold key marginals Longman in Queensland and Braddon in Tasmania, Labor has unleashed $320m in promised spending in the seats. The Coalition has pledged $130m in the campaign to recapture the seats off Labor and to regain Mayo in South Australia from Centre Alliance\u2019s Rebekha Sharkie. The most expensive promise of the campaign is Labor\u2019s $120m for Sunshine Coast\u2019s new Moreton Bay University campus, of which $50m is designated for its \u201csuper lab\u201d and $70m for university places. In Tasmania, both parties are promising $30m for a cableway at Cradle Mountain and $60m for the Bass Highway upgrade. Labor has promised $25m to help Tasmania get an Australian rules men\u2019s and women\u2019s club, contingent on the Australian Football League allowing them into the competition. It has pledged a further $5m for local football clubs and $10m for recreational fishing. The Coalition has promised $10m for an aquatic centre and $4.4m for a sporting precinct in Mount Barker, South Australia. As reported by Guardian Australia on Friday, the Turnbull government has also promised $194,000 for CCTVs in Tasmania. One council received a federal grant worth $134,000, despite not having applied for the money. Public polling suggests Sharkie is streets ahead of Liberal candidate Georgina Downer in the Mayo race, but Longman and Braddon are likely to be close contests. Labor\u2019s candidate for Longman, Susan Lamb, has closed an early deficit to sit at 50-50 in the two-party preferred polls. While Labor fears that One Nation preferences will assist the Liberal-National party\u2019s Trevor Ruthenberg, the incorrect claim he made about having been awarded a medal for distinguished military service has harmed his campaign. The Coalition is playing down its chances in Braddon and Longman, although betting odds have it narrowly ahead in both contests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
