Secondhand Haddonstone garden ornaments and statuary are fetching higher prices at auction than the brand new versions, even though the products are less than 30 years old and a long way from being classed as antique. Haddonstone is a special form of reconstructed limestone with a surface similar to Portland Stone, which develops a sought-after patina of age after a couple of winters' weathering. A Haddonstone Medium Pool raised \u00a34,000 at a Sotheby's auction last summer, although the same piece costs \u00a32,200 plus VAT new, and cost \u00a31,450 when it was made in 1980. A second-hand pair of scrolled jardinieres, currently selling for \u00a3276 plus VAT, fetched \u00a3900 in May 2001. Call 01604 770711 or visit www.haddonstone.co.uk. \u00b7 The Bathroom and Shower Information Service provides free, practical advice on all bathroom-related enquiries - from prices, budgets and finding plumbers to water pressure and underfloor heating. It also publishes Soak, a magazine designed to help readers create their perfect bathroom. The service is funded by American Standards, which owns Armitage Shanks, Ideal Standard, Sottini and Trevi Showers, and is therefore unlikely to promote other companies' brands of sanitaryware. But the service is independent in other areas, such as tiles and radiators. Call 0800 746 9377 or visit www.thebathroom.info. \u00b7 The Buy-to-let Handbook is described as a 'clear and concise guide for everyone who wants to rent out property and avoid agency fees by creating and managing his own tenancy'. The book, written by former estate agent and landlord Tony Booth and published by How to Books, covers everything from finding and buying the right property, finding good tenants, obtaining forms and completing tenancy agreements, dealing with deposits and arrears, regaining possession and complying with legislation. In bookshops, priced \u00a39.99. \u00b7 One in three people is left-handed, yet almost all kitchen and garden tools are designed for right-handed folks. But left-handed homeowners don't have to put up with poorly sheared hedges, badly peeled potatoes and depressingly uncorked wine. Anything Left-Handed produces a range of goods specifically for left-handers, from scissors and corkscrews to can-openers and secateurs.
