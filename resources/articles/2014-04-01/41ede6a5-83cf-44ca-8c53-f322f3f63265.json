In the first detailed examination of the risks to children of drug treatment medications, the charity Adfam said that in the last five years there were 17 serious case reviews \u2013 undertaken when a child in care dies from abuse or neglect \u2013 involving opiate substitutes. In about a fifth of cases studied, parents were \"deliberately administering methadone to young children, apparently in misguided attempts to soothe or pacify them\". The charity said: \"Although methadone is effective in treating drug addiction, child ingestions happen with depressing regularity and national lessons are not being learned from serious case reviews. We are seeing a rare but real use of methadone as a pacifier for small children.\" The charity also warned that many of cases were of preventable deaths where children died after accidently drinking methadone \u2013 and called for the synthetic opioid to be kept in \"strong boxes\" to prevent a fatal mishap at home. Only last December a two-year-old boy died after swallowing his mother's methadone from a beaker. In 2012 almost 61,000 drug-addict parents in England were receiving a \"prescribing intervention\" to wean them off their habit. Vivienne Evans, chief executive of Adfam, said: \"It was likely that the number of children being given drugs or taking them accidently is higher than the serious case reviews show. \"We need hospitals to start analysing admissions for child poisoning to get a better picture. We have no idea how many kids are turning up at A&amp;E having been given methadone. \"Just one of these cases would be one case too many, but this research shows that they have happened with depressing regularity over the last decade. We need a more proactive and nationally coordinated plan to tackle these risks, rather than waiting for every area in the country to experience a tragedy before anyone takes action.\" Adfam cautioned that social workers and GPs were resistant to the idea that parents would give their own children drugs to calm them. The charity's report, entitled \"tackling the risks to children\", says: \"Many professionals found the very idea of intentional administration a difficult one to accept, and were reluctant to believe their clients would behave in such a way.\" Judith Yates, an inner-city Birmingham GP working on drug policy who advised Adfam, said that \"giving methadone to young children is not as strange as you might think\". \"You have to remember that in Victorian times parents gave babies opium tinctures to soothe them. The fact is that today some babies are born drug-dependent. Children born to mothers taking methadone have a drug dependency which hospitals deal with through a withdrawal program for two weeks after birth. Their parents sometimes mistakenly think a baby crying at home is doing so because of opium cravings and give them their methadone.\" Yates said that her surgery had changed its advice after reviewing Adfam's work to \"explicitly tell parents not to give methadone to their children in any circumstance\". Guidelines from the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) state that the risks to children should be assessed by professionals deciding which drugs to prescribe and whether they can be taken home by the patient. However, the Adfam report suggests the risks to children are not being adequately managed in practice. Meg Munn, the Labour MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on child protection, said: \"Whilst we have a clear view of the risks involved with these medications, it's unacceptable that we don't know how many children might be affected: we need to know more about take-home prescriptions and how many children are exposed to them.\" \"These tragedies are not always unavoidable. Parents and all the professionals working with them have a responsibility to manage the dangers posed by powerful prescription drugs being stored in the home, and we need them all to take a more active role in minimising risk.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
