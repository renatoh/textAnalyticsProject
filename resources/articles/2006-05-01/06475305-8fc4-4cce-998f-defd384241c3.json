Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed, the so-called Tipton Three, and Jamal al-Harith, from Manchester, want $10m (\u00a35.4m) in damages from the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and 10 US military commanders. The men, who were held at the camp in Cuba for nearly three years, claim they were forced to shave off their beards, harassed as they worshipped and once saw a guard throw a copy of the Koran into a toilet bucket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
