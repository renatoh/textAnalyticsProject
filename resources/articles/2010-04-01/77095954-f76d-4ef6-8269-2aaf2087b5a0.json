Registered blind, the 27-year-old needs specialist equipment for his information technology degree at Reading University, including software to magnify screens and recognise his speech. At the beginning of this academic year, the university changed its operating system, rendering Long's special software incompatible with the new system. So he applied for Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA), to fund an upgrade in his equipment. But six months on, he is still waiting for funding. Long is by no means alone in experiencing difficulties with the DSA. Indeed, the latest figures show that at the end of the financial year, 10,363 disabled students out of 22,112 who applied for DSA have yet to receive payment. The chaos stems from a change in the administration of the system in which responsibility for DSA was moved from local authorities in 2009 to Student Finance England, the English arm of the Student Loans Company. The delays have left many disabled students angry and frustrated, particularly at the inability to get through to speak to someone at Student Finance England. They include Long and others who have started a Facebook campaign. \"When the system was moved to Student Finance England it became worse. The new system is over-complicated,\" says Long. \"It was a lot easier dealing with local councils. Student Finance England's forms are a lot more complicated as well and you just don't get answers. \"They make it so damn hard \u2013 the booklet alone is a 30-page document and the forms are not electronic, so I have to get someone to fill them in. The wait for funding has caused Long's studies to suffer. He has to rely on Reading University to provide a note-taker and has trouble taking part in practical assignments and experiments. \"I've managed to get myself back on track by asking a few favours of the university, such as support in classrooms, and another student is willing to help me, but I'm worried that because the university is going to have their budget cut then that will affect me,\" Long explains. The delays in getting his equipment have, he says, had an impact on his grades. \"My grades have been affected. I'm now down to about a 3rd, whereas last year I was at the level of 2:2.\" \"It does make me angry and it's getting worse and worse. Part of me thinks that if I didn't need this degree I might have packed it in.\" He has now decided to prolong his studies to get back on track. \"I'm going to split my third year into two years, which has further financial implications because that means an extra year on my student loan. All this makes life extremely difficult. I'm going to keep going, though it does worry me a hell of a lot.\" Lizzie Mitchell also experienced similar difficulties. She is studying for a one-year graduate diploma in law at Oxford Brookes University, but it was only in February that she received the equipment she applied for in March 2009. She is still pursuing a claim for textbooks. Aware, like Long, that receiving the DSA might be a slow process, she applied when she was in her final year of a history degree at Royal Holloway, University of London. Hearing nothing about her application, she contacted Student Finance England, only to be wrongly told that postgraduate students did not qualify for DSA. \"After many frantic phone calls and emails, I was finally able to get through to Student Finance England, who told me there had been an administrative error and my application would be reinstated and the process restarted,\" says Mitchell. \"However, by this point I had only two weeks before the start of my course.\" Eventually, Oxford Brookes stepped in to provide the note-takers she needs as a result of having hypermobility syndrome, which causes chronic back and neck pain. \"It has been a complete nightmare from start to finish. I have just had so many problems. Whenever I've tried to get in touch with them and get help, I've come up against a brick wall. Nobody's been able to help me,\" says Mitchell. \"Receiving the equipment has made a huge difference to the amount and quality of the work I am able to do, but I am extremely angry that I did not get what I needed \u2013 and was entitled to \u2013 until more than halfway through my course.\" The National Union of Students' disabled students officer, Adam Hyland, said: \"This continuing shambles has left many disabled students without the support they need. \"As a result, there are disabled students who are failing their assessments, becoming extremely stressed and anxious, and in some cases dropping out of their course. I urge the Student Loans Company to clean this mess up now.\" The Student Loans Company says it has doubled the size of the DSA team and is now working towards a target of 15 days to process initial applications. It also says it is recruiting more staff and improving training. \"We apologise to students who have experienced difficulties and delays with their DSA applications this year. We offer a highly personalised service to meet individual needs, so the process takes longer, and many students only apply once their course has started and their need for specialist equipment comes to light. \"However, we are aware that there have been a number of problems this year and we are doing all we can to process outstanding applications as swiftly as possible. We are currently closely assessing the entire DSA system to identify where we can improve and speed up the process.\" The academic year will soon be drawing to a close and it will be one that many, like Chris and Lizzie, would rather forget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
