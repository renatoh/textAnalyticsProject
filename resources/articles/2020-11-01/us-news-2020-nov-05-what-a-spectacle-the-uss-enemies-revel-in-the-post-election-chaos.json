Who says that? The president who is currently in office.\u201d With a large dose of schadenfreude, Washington\u2019s fiercest critics declared deep concern about the US elections and the state of the country\u2019s democracy. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman on Thursday panned the \u201cobvious shortcomings of the American electoral system\u201d, calling the framework \u201carchaic\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a show, you can\u2019t call it anything but that,\u201d Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of Russia\u2019s Duma, said earlier this week. \u201cThey say it should be seen as a standard for democracy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the standard.\u201d In China, state media savaged the delayed results, with one daily writing that the process looked a \u201cbit like a developing country\u201d. Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, could not resist baiting the US over what he called its \u201csurprising electoral process\u201d, and seemed so amused that at one point he broke into song with a rendition of the theme tune to the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant: \u201cOn a night as beautiful as this, either of them could win,\u201d he crooned, before adding with a chuckle: \u201cThe United States. I don\u2019t stick my nose in.\u201d In two recent local elections, he noted, all the votes had been counted by 11pm. As a parliamentary campaign kicked off in Venezuela this week, Maduro claimed there were important lessons the US could learn from its elections rather than lecturing the world about democracy. Venezuela was a showcase of \u201ccivilised and peaceful\u201d voting using \u201cproven and transparent technology\u201d and biometric voting machines that provided same day results, he said. Trump has spent the last two years unsuccessfully trying to topple the Venezuelan president and in a Wednesday night broadcast Maduro delighted in the electoral confusion gripping his northern neighbour. \u201cThe state department puts out statements that say: \u2018In this country we don\u2019t recognise the election. In that country we don\u2019t like the election. In the other country we don\u2019t like this or that,\u2019\u201d Maduro said, adding that the US would be better off focusing on its own problems. \u201cWho\u2019s the banana republic now?\u201d wondered the frontpage headline of Colombia\u2019s Publimetro, one of many Latin American newspapers whose editors thought the term \u2013 a US-originated slur that was inspired by Honduras and has haunted Latin America for decades \u2013 perfectly captured the electoral turmoil playing out in the US. Merval Pereira, one of Brazil\u2019s most prominent political commentators, called his daily column \u201cBananas americanas\u201d and wrote: \u201cThis is a singular event in US democratic history which puts the country in the list of banana republics, an expression created by the Americans themselves.\u201d As Trump demanded states stop counting mail-in ballots, the US embassy in Abidjan issued a poorly timed statement urging C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s leaders to \u201cshow commitment to the democratic process and the rule of law\u201d. \u201cWe also need a C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire statement on US elections,\u201d quipped one BBC editor on Twitter. For many, it was a chance to give the US a taste of its own medicine. \u201cNeither free nor fair,\u201d wrote Margarita Simonyan, the head of Russian state-backed RT, parroting the language of a UN or Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) statement. And the OSCE itself did weigh in, with mission leader Michael Georg Link attacking Trump for making \u201cbaseless allegations of systematic deficiencies\u201d and \u201c[harming] public trust in democratic institutions\u201d. The irony was not lost on many at home. A cartoon by the Russian critic Sergei Elkin made the rounds on Thursday, featuring an elderly babushka lugging buckets of water past a man in a rundown village somewhere in Russia. \u201cThey still haven\u2019t finished counting in Pennsylvania and in Michigan,\u201d the man says. A stray dog walks along an unpaved street behind him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
