First up is a brand of autobiographical realism that clunks along with accompanying text full of pop-culture references. The short strips often feature art students determined to paw at such deep questions as \"what shall I do when I lose my hair?\" Next comes \"an intermediate bighead cartoony style\", which thankfully gives way to more lively artwork featuring the anthropomorphic animal people that continue to populate Jason's work. The strips in the latter half also show Jason beginning to pay attention to plot, inference and economy. Ernest Hemingway is one of his obsessions, and he pops up in the grizzled form of Papa. When Jason follows Hemingway's lessons of brevity and purpose the results are a world away from the derivative visuals and lazy storytelling of his early work. The anthology is a glimpse of how one artist found not only his own style but, eventually, the good sense to leave atmospherics behind for the sake of plot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
