Don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s as futile as rewriting the past", "bodyText": "There\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019re worried, right now, about what the future holds. I raise this in the context of next week\u2019s election and Brexit, of course, but that situation\u2019s hardly unique: many of us are always worried about what the future holds, in some domain \u2013 and still would be even if politics suddenly started going our way. Which makes this as good a time as any to recall what a strange emotion worry is. No matter how much badness is in store for you, once you\u2019ve taken whatever precautions you can, worry is largely useless. In prehistory, when threats were immediate and physical, a surge of anxiety could motivate evasive action. But that\u2019s not true of most modern worries, whether they\u2019re political, environmental, related to your job, your relationship or your kids; instead, the anxiety just hangs around and feeds on itself. Honestly, it might be preferable just to have to outrun a sabre-toothed tiger every few weeks. It\u2019s interesting to consider the asymmetry in our feelings about the future versus the past. Looking ahead, life\u2019s unpredictability maddens us, and we worry because we feel, if subconsciously, that doing so will help bring the future under our control. (Or we act hyper-cautiously, also in hopes of controlling the future: \u201cDad suggests arriving at airport 14 hours early,\u201d reads an Onion headline, apparently inspired by my childhood.) Yet, looking backwards \u2013 and I know I risk sounding like I\u2019ve been consuming substances derived from the leaf of the cannabis plant here \u2013 isn\u2019t it odd that we\u2019re untroubled by the zigzagging path of coincidence and unpredictability that brought us to this point? \u201cSometimes I wake up with a feeling of childish amazement \u2013 why am I myself?\u201d wrote Simone de Beauvoir. \u201cWhat astonishes me\u2026 is the fact of finding myself here, and at this moment, deep in this life and not in any other\u2026 The penetration of that particular ovum by that particular spermatozoon, with its implications of the meeting of my parents and before that of their birth and the birth of all their forebears, had not one chance in hundreds of millions of coming about.\u201d It\u2019s no mystery that we should care more about the unpredictability of the future; the past, after all, is water under the bridge. What\u2019s bizarre about the energy we invest in fretting about the future is that we should imagine we ever could have much control over, or knowledge of it, given how little we had in the past. Countless coincidences and blind historical forces made you who you are today. Wouldn\u2019t it be reasonable to assume they\u2019ll play an overwhelming role in what happens next? And doesn\u2019t that drive home the fact that worrying about it can\u2019t possibly be productive? I don\u2019t mean to imply you can reason yourself out of worry entirely. But there\u2019s some liberation in realising the truth: when you worry, you\u2019re demanding reassurance, yet this is something you\u2019ll definitely never get from the future, for the simple reason that it hasn\u2019t occurred yet. Certainly, it\u2019s worth taking action in the present to increase the probability that things will go well. But that\u2019s as far as your influence extends. In a profound sense, the future itself is none of your business.
