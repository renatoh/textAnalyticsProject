Last week, Larycia Hawkins, an associate professor of political science at Wheaton College, announced her decision to wear a hijab as a demonstration of \u201chuman solidarity\u201d with Muslims, in the wake of the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which authorities said was inspired by Islamist terrorists. \u201cI stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind,\u201d she posted on Facebook. \u201cI stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book.\u201d But the comments made by the 43-year-old generated confusion at Wheaton\u2019s campus about \u201ccomplex theological matters\u201d, the college asserted in a statement last Friday. And, it continued, some Christians may have interpreted Hawkins\u2019 remarks as a failure to \u201creflect the distinctively Christian theological identity of Wheaton College\u201d. As a result of Hawkins\u2019 comments, Wheaton, a private evangelical liberal arts college in Chicago\u2019s west suburbs, placed the professor on administrative leave, pending a review the college said she\u2019s entitled to receive as a tenured faculty member. The college declined a request for comment but in a statement issued on Wednesday, Wheaton president Dr Philip Ryken said it has \u201cno stated position\u201d on whether headscarves can be worn \u201cas a gesture of care and concern for those in Muslim or other religious communities that may face discrimination or persecution\u201d. \u201cWe support the protection of all Americans including the right to the free exercise of religion, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Ryken said. Hawkins, who did not respond to requests for comment, told the Chicago Tribune she planned to don the hijab everywhere until Christmas. The US is currently dealing with \u201creal vitriolic rhetoric by fellow Christians, sometimes, and people who aren\u2019t Christians who conflate all Muslims with terrorists \u2013 and that saddens me \u2013 so this is a way of saying if all women wear the hijab we cannot discriminate,\u201d Hawkins told the newspaper. Prior to her decision, Hawkins sought the advice of the Council on American Islamic Relations (Cair) chapter in Chicago, to ensure it wasn\u2019t offensive for a non-Muslim to wear the hijab. Hawkins and a staff member at the Cair office had an informal discussion, and \u201che supported the idea, as do we officially\u201d, Rehab said. \u201cIt speaks really to her sense of compassion and integrity as a human being,\u201d executive director Ahmed Rehab told the Guardian. Hawkins was confident her decision fell in line with her understanding of the religion, Rehab said, \u201cbut it turns out that others within the Christian tradition felt that this was out of bounds, unfortunately\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re dismayed by [Wheaton\u2019s] decision,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause essentially it is an act of human solidarity meant to be rooted in theological compassion \u2013 to stand with students, Muslim students at Wheaton and elsewhere who are the victims of this current backlash of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry.\u201d Rehab said the reasoning of Hawkins\u2019 decision was clear. \u201cShe\u2019s walking a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes,\u201d he said, and it was rooted in Christian theology of compassion. \u201cAnyone who disagrees with that,\u201d he continued, \u201cI would ask them why? Why they believe Christianity should be non-compassionate, and why they would differ with this Christian woman and her understanding. I\u2019d love to hear an answer to that.\u201d Students at Wheaton drew attention last week in an open letter decrying statements by Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr that students armed with firearms could \u201cend those Muslims\u201d. The letter called on evangelical Christian leaders to condemn Falwell\u2019s remarks. On Wednesday, they demanded Hawkins\u2019 reinstatement and launched a social media campaign under the hashtag #ReinstateDocHawk. \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 16 November 2015 to reflect that Hawkins\u2019s comments, not her decision to wear a hijab, lead to her being placed on leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
