There was clearly something wrong when Kieren Fallon, the champion jockey for five of the past six years, was scratched from the 2003 title betting by two leading bookmakers on New Year's Eve. Yesterday, it emerged that Fallon had started treatment for alcohol-related problems at the precise moment that the layers' phones started ringing with bet after bet for Richard Hughes, Kevin Darley and Seb Sanders. There is little room for sentiment when it comes to betting, of course. What chance that those punters who were in the know stopped for even a second to consider the hundreds of favours Fallon has done them down the years? Yet even if they managed to get on, it may be that the champion jockey will make them wish that they hadn't. Quoted in a Sunday newspaper, Fallon insisted that he would never touch alcohol again after realising that drink was affecting both his career and his family life. \"Last season I rode 150 winners but my heart wasn't in it as it was before,\" Fallon told the Sunday Times. \"Had I got stale? Had I got lazy? I was wasting these years. I realised alcohol was taking the enjoyment away and for me, the important thing was to recognise this before it got too late.\" Fallon is now undergoing a 30-day treatment programme at a clinic in Ireland. \"What I've seen is the misery,\" he said. \"The misery of the life I've had, the stupid things I was doing. The waste of time, the waste of opportunity: everything should have been so much better.\" There is no indication, however, that Fallon will not be riding when the Flat's turf season opens in March. Quite the opposite.\"I'm looking forward to this season like I have never looked forward to a season in my life,\" Fallon says. \"I believe I will be a much better jockey and I want to be a better person.\" This sounds like good news both for Fallon and his legions of followers. The champion appreciates that he has a problem and set out to tackle it, presumably with the same grit and effort that gets him home in so many close finishes. Fallon has already rebuilt his career twice, first after a six-month ban in 1994 for pulling Stuart Webster off his horse after a race at Beverley, and then following a serious injury in a fall at Royal Ascot in June 2000, which almost cost him the use of his arm. The fight against alcohol is a different challenge, but he will not want for support in the weighing room or among trainers and punters. One question that remains is whether his problems owe anything to the macho culture of the weighing room, or the constant battle with the scales that burdens most Flat jockeys. Booze is an obvious friend when semi-starvation is all that the future seems to hold from one month to the next. But there is no evidence that jockeys are any more prone to drink problems than footballers or rugby players. And if there are any more riders who are struggling to cope with alcohol, Fallon's decision to go public with his own story may even offer them a glimpse of a forward path. Not least if he returns - as he hopes and expects - as a much better jockey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
