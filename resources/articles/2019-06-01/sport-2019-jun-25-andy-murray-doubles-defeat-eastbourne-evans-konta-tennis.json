If Andy Murray epitomises artful struggle \u2013 and the Scot\u2019s first stumble in his comeback here on Tuesday, when the excellent Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah beat him and Marcelo Melo 6-2, 6-4 in just over an hour, was not a seismic shock \u2013 Evans is the hero of the artful dodgers, a reformed rebel with educated hands and a quick brain. Hardcourt is the surface that suits his game best, but grass is not far behind, and he showed enough deft touches in beating the Moldovan clay-courter Radu Albot 7-6 (2), 6-2 in the first round of the Nature Valley International to suggest he will surprise a few people at Wimbledon next week. Murray\u2019s return to Wimbledon after an absence of a year is hugely anticipated, but it will be with his third partner in as many weeks, the Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert, having lifted the Queen\u2019s trophy on Sunday with Feliciano L\u00f3pez. That is a lot of adjustment to make when he goes back on court next week. Murray admitted that switching partners was not ideal. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s obviously not the perfect situation to be in, but playing a match within 40 hours of finishing [at Queen\u2019s] is quite a quick turnaround. Conditions here are very different. It\u2019s really slow out there. Also, they returned extremely well. They made it tough for both of us.\u201d He also said he would probably decide on Wednesday whether or not to play mixed doubles at Wimbledon. \u201cYou get a couple of bad days of rain, you can end up having to play best-of-five doubles followed by a mixed doubles,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can happen a couple of days in a row. I need to be certain that I\u2019m ready to do that. I think I should be OK.\u201d While Murray hit some wondrous shots in defeat under gathering clouds on Tuesday evening, the Colombians \u2013 whom Murray and L\u00f3pez had beaten in the first round at Queen\u2019s \u2013 were too organised, grooved and disciplined. That could describe the transformation in Evans\u2019s tennis over the past year. He was still rebuilding his interesting career when, ranked 342 in the world, he lost in the second round of qualifying at Wimbledon to the 32-year-old German Matthias Bachinger. Next week, now ranked 65, he is in the main draw by right \u2013 and in form. Before losing to Stan Wawrinka in the first round at Queen\u2019s last week, Evans had won 10 matches in a row on grass. The best he has done at the All England Club in four visits was reaching the third round in 2016, where Roger Federer was waiting for him. After beating Albot, the world No 41, in an entertaining hour and 48 minutes on the Centre Court at the lovely Devonshire Park club, he said: \u201cI like the grass. There are quite a few who don\u2019t like the grass, so it gives me an advantage in that way.\u201d He is looking forward to Wimbledon rather than regarding it as an obstacle to his progress. Here he saved nine of 10 break points and got out of trouble with some precise serving and solid groundstrokes. However, there is a problem with tournaments a week before a slam: they are a week before a slam \u2013 and that can place self-preservation ahead of ambition. Evans does not see it that way. He wants ranking points. \u201cI got plenty of time last week to look after myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t pick and choose my tournaments yet. So it\u2019s a great week for me here to try and get some points on the board again.\u201d Cameron Norrie, meanwhile, set up an all-British second-round match with Kyle Edmund after beating J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy, 6-3, 7-6 (4). The artful Frenchman lost in five to sets to Edmund, the British No 1, on the clay of Roland Garros last month, but his sting was drawn on the teasing grass of Eastbourne. The winner could play Evans, if the Birmingham player gets past Herbert in the next round. The Frenchman beat the American Denis Kudla 5-7, 7-6 (8), 6-4. Britain\u2019s No 1 woman, Johanna Konta, looked solid again as she looks to put her Roland Garros semi-final disappointment behind her, although there were some anxious moments at 3-5 in the second set before she got the better of the promising Greek Maria Sakkari 6-4, 7-6 (4). \u201cOur points felt that she was playing better than me,\u201d Konta admitted, \u201cso I was really pleased that I was able to stay with her. It could have easily gone to a third set. I definitely wasn\u2019t taking anything for granted out there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
