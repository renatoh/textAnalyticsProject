Some called the comments silly and weird, others branded them irresponsible. The taoiseach made the comments in Dublin last week at the launch of an upbeat progress report on the government\u2019s climate action plan. \u201cOne thing we definitely face as a result of climate change is a warmer winter. We\u2019re already experiencing warmer winters and that actually means using less energy because it\u2019s warmer and people need less heating and it also means fewer deaths as a result of cold weather,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that when you do look at those things there is a ledger, and there are benefits and there are downsides. The downsides outweigh the benefits, but we need to be aware of them too.\u201d Irish Doctors for the Environment, an advocacy group, wrote to Varadkar on Monday saying the climate crisis had an \u201coverwhelmingly negative effect on human health\u201d. It asked him to retract and \u201caddress the errors\u201d in his speech. Other environmental campaigners expressed anger and disbelief. \u201cThat the taoiseach would make these comments while delivering a progress report on his government\u2019s climate action plan exposes the extent to which that plan is a surface level response to a multi-faceted crisis, the scale of which they fail to comprehend,\u201d said the Green party. \u201cMillions are dying or being displaced right now. That will rise to hundreds of millions if the complacency of governments around the world continues. Our milder winters are punctuated by cold snaps that threaten our most vulnerable, including the thousands of people now homeless.\u201d Ois\u00edn Coghlan, the director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, acknowledged Ireland could benefit in a narrow way but said the climate emergency\u2019s wider impacts on the country and the rest of the world were overwhelmingly negative. Cara Augustenborg, an environmental scientist at University College Dublin, echoed that view, saying the few lives that might be spared from winter-related deaths paled in comparison to wider suffering. Extinction Rebellion Ireland called the comments shocking. \u201cIt\u2019s time for civil disobedience,\u201d the group said. The spat came as climate experts warned that a catastrophic storm during high tide will flood thousands of homes, businesses and landmark buildings in Dublin in the coming decades. Peter Thorne, a lead author on the fifth assessment report of the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said Ireland had so far been able to \u201cdodge a bullet\u201d because storms have struck during low tides. Ireland is one of the EU\u2019s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than \u20ac250m (\u00a3216m) for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting renewable energy. The government unveiled an ambitious plan in June that outlined measures to curb emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In recent days the singer Cher and the actor Mark Ruffalo have added their voices to a campaign to stop Ireland becoming an entry point for fracked US gas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
