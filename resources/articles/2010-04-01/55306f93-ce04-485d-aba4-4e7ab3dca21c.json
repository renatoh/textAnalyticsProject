At a nuclear security summit in Washington they will be expected to pledge concrete action to help protect an estimated 1,600 tonnes of weapons-grade uranium (highly enriched uranium \u2013 HEU) and 500 tonnes of plutonium stored in over 1,000 sites in 40 countries under widely varying degrees of security. Just 25kg (55lb) of HEU or nearly 8kg of plutonium is required to make a bomb. There have been 15 confirmed cases of weapons-grade material being smuggled in the last 17 years. In the name of preventing nuclear terrorism, the US and Russia will today sign a long-delayed agreement to dispose of 34 tonnes of plutonium from decommissioned weapons, by using it in power stations. Officials say they expect Canada and Ukraine to announce plans to convert HEU reactors to low enriched uranium, which would be much harder for terrorists to turn into a bomb if stolen. Last month, Chile shipped all the spent HEU fuel from its research reactors to the US. The summit was called by Obama a year ago to pursue the abolition of nuclear weapons and set a target of four years to secure vulnerable stockpiles of fissile material. States are being called upon to take unilateral action to improve security on their own stockpiles and to ratify UN conventions on nuclear security standards to make them legally binding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
