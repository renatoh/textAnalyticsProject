According to the National Union of Students, around 200 delegates from across the UK urged MPs to put pressure on ministers to scrap the \"regressive\" proposals in the government's white paper on higher education funding. Mandy Telford, NUS president, said: \"NUS already has widespread support across the political spectrum for our funding campaign, as shown by the hundreds of signatures we have had from MPs for our early day motions in the last few months.\" Sounding a warning to MPs, she added: \"Student funding was the number one issue on the doorstep at the last general election and the student vote in many constituencies can easily be the difference between MPs keeping or losing their jobs. Despite waiting months for this white paper, we believe they are just a set of disastrous proposals that will do nothing to enable access to university or ease student debt and hardship,\" she said. Twenty six MPs, including Dr Ian Gibson, head of the House of Commons science and technology committee, and Liberal Democrat education spokesmen David Rendel and Phil Willis, have already signed an early day motion tabled by Selby MP John Grogan, which states: \"That this House supports the National Union of Students' campaign against student top-up fees; agrees that the government's proposals for top-up fees will mean access to university is based on ability to pay not ability to learn; and urges the government to abandon its plans for top-up fees, which will lead to a two-tier higher education system.\" The students were met at Westminster by the writer and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, who is standing for the Oxford chancellorship on a no fees platform. She told the students: \"Access to British universities must be through merit not cash. More fees and more debt will simply mean fewer students from poor backgrounds. \"Universities need more money but this shouldn't be a burden left to students to shoulder. With a fair and progressive taxation system Britain can give students free higher education. The same free education that the government has benefited from,\" she said. Meanwhile, the NUS received a boost to its campaign from the head of the funding body for English universities, Sir Howard Newby. He told the Commons education select committee this morning that he believed plans to restore a grant of \u00a31,000 was \"not enough\". But he said he thought inadequate grants were more of a deterrent than higher fees to students from poor families. \"I simply feel that the proposals on the maintenance award are less than generous,\" he said. \u00b7 NUS Scotland launched a student manifesto for the Scottish Parliamentary elections yesterday, which it hopes will be adopted by all major political parties ahead of the elections. Speaking on the publication, Rami Okasha, president of NUS Scotland, said: \"This is a manifesto which all political parties in Scotland should sign up to. It rules out top-up fees and extra charges for students in Scotland in place of top-up fees. It promises that students will get a high-quality education, and that it will be easy for bright kids to go from college to university.\" Scottish students do not pay upfront tuition fees, but instead pay \u00a32,000 after graduation. At present there are no plans to change the system or introduce top-up fees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
