The producers of the play Rotterdam, on at the Nuffield Southampton Theatres, announced Saturday\u2019s performances would not go ahead because of \u201ca hate crime directed at two of our actors\u201d. They tweeted: \u201cWe are devastated that this kind of behaviour is still so prevalent, a fact which reinforces the importance of this play\u2019s message. We are doing all we can to support the team and thank our audiences and colleagues for their support.\u201d They said two actors in the company were assaulted on their way to work. \u201cThe assailants verbally abused them and threw stones from their car window, one of which struck an actor in the face. \u201cThey have sustained only minor injuries but are hugely shaken from this cowardly, homophobic hate crime. The production have requested anyone with relevant information should contact the local police.\u201d Lucy Jane Parkinson said they had been kissing their girlfriend, Rebecca Banatvala, who is also in the play, when they were attacked. \u201cThe car was coming past and they shouted something and something hit me between my eye and my temple,\u201d they said. \u201cIt knocked me to the floor and I could hear them laughing as the car was driving off.\u201d In a statement, the actors said: \u201cThe attack happened because we were embracing. There\u2019s no mistake that this was a homophobic hate crime. It was a cowardly attack as it was a moving car. Our community shouldn\u2019t have to tolerate this. \u201cThis is why we have Pride. We should take all steps we can in the education system to help to eradicate this aggressive ignorance from strangers to other strangers.\u201d Hampshire constabulary said: \u201cWe have received a report from a third party relating to an incident which happened on Hill Lane, Southampton, on the afternoon of Saturday 8 June. \u201cIt has been reported that homophobic abuse was shouted at two women, and stones thrown at them, by the occupants of a passing car.\u201d Rotterdam, by Jon Brittain, premiered at Theatre 503 in south London in 2015 and transferred to Trafalgar Studios the following year. It is about a couple living in Rotterdam: the character Alice has found the courage to come out to her parents as gay, and her partner, Fiona, tells her she has always identified as a man and wants to be called Adrian. The play won an Olivier award for outstanding achievement in an affiliate theatre and is touring the UK. Parkinson said: \u201cThis is what we do this job for. It\u2019s not the first time that anybody in the queer community has experienced something like this and unfortunately it won\u2019t be the last. We just have to keep getting back up, brushing ourselves off and moving forward. We need to keep putting on shows like Rotterdam and having queer representation in TV.\u201d The incident happened a week after a gay couple were subjected to a homophobic attack on a bus in north London. Melania Geymonat and her girlfriend, Chris, were assaulted after refusing to kiss each other on demand for a group of young men. The Metropolitan police are treating the attack as a hate crime. Four males between the ages of 15 and 18 have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and aggravated grievous bodily harm. A 16-year-old boy has also been arrested on suspicion of robbery and aggravated burglary. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 to correct the pronouns used for an actor who was quoted in the piece."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
