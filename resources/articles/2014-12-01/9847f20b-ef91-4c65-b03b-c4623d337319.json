Earlier in the day, Sony announced that more than 200 theatres in the US will also show the film , which Sony had previously pulled from release after a hack and threats of violence. Some of the biggest cinema chains in the US are noticeably absent from the list including AMC, Cinemark, Landmark and Regal, with independents such as Michael Moore\u2019s theater, The Bijou in Traverse City, making up the difference.
