Ibragimova and Tiberghien are a wonderfully matched pairing, with her astonishing command of tone colour and articulation complemented by his rhythmic alertness and lightness of touch. There's always an edge to their playing that keeps both the music and the audience on their toes, so that even a work as familiar as the Op 24 Spring Sonata can produce suprises, like the astonishingly beautiful half tone that Ibragimova conjures up for the start of its Adagio. In Beethoven's final violin sonata, the G major Op 96, both violinist and pianist understand the music's laconic, conversational style perfectly, realising how much can be implied by so little and how it demands a true blending of musical voices, with neither player dominating the other. It's beautifully judged, like all the performances here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
