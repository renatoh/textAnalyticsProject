Her lightning-fast speed typing wowed the world during GDC2005, and since then there's no conference un-noted. But there's a challenger to her throne. Mark at 3pointD gives good type too. Both excellent bloggers' transcriptions of Will Wright's keynote speech at SXSW are available here and here (with video). Highlights: On story in games: Stories tend to be unchanging, very linear, whereas games tend to be open ended. Game is vehicle for player to explore difft paths and directions. Movies are primarily visual, games are primarily interactive, so whenever we take control away from player at all we are taking away the most important thing about games. Like going to a theater and showing a blank screen. On Groundhog Day: Groundhog Day is one of my all time favorites. Interesting, felt most like a game. Linear sequence, but all of a sudden it's 6:00am again, he does it again, then again, again. What's interesting about Groundhog Day, it was a game, he had to restart. This is a really interesting example of where the audience knew the past, so every day the director could skip more and more of the sequence. On education: I went to Montessori school till 5th grade, and Maria Montessori, her idea was if you build toys and let kids play with them, they explore and discover the principles of the world around them by themselves. The games I make I think of in those terms, very elaborate Montessori toys. How can we lead players to come across interesting ideas of philosophy and science. This can be understood as a philosophy tool, get you to think about meaning of life. On the future of games: When you look at games specifically and entertainment in general heading into the future, games have a perception as being simple and meaningless, but really they can be much much more than that. They can allow us to develop systemic thinking, build much more elaborate, more accurate models of the world around us. Because of that, they potentially give us the ability to approach the future with just a little bit more interlligence than we had before. They can allow us to change the world just a little bit for the better over the rest of our lives. Head to Wonderland and 3pointD for the rest of it.
