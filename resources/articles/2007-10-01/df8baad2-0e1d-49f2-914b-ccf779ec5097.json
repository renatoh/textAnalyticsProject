Vittorio Capocelli, the prefect of Treviso, near Venice, made his ruling after meeting immigrants' representatives. He said women who sought to wear the burka for religious reasons were free to do so, but would have to reveal their features if asked to do so for the purposes of identification. The burka covers the body from head to foot, with the exception of a small mesh at eye level. The announcement by the prefect - the local representative of the interior ministry - also appeared to clear the way for the use of the equally controversial and more widely worn niqab, which leaves only the eyes visible. Both garments, however, are apparently at odds with a 1975 law that bans the wearing of masks in public. It was originally introduced as part of a clampdown on terrorism and violent demonstrations. In Treviso, moreover, the burka is the target of a specific ban. Three years ago, the city's mayor, Giancarlo Gentilini of the anti-immigrant Northern League, said he had introduced the bylaw because the garment was \"a mask that can be permitted at carnival time, but not throughout the year\". In a front-page article in yesterday's Corriere della Sera, the paper's Egyptian-born deputy editor, Magdi Allam, attacked Mr Capocelli's counter-initiative as symptomatic of an attitude that was \"leading us straight to the suicide of our civilisation\". Were it endorsed at national level, he argued, Islamic women \"could soon be going to school, taking jobs and going around freely, completely veiled\". Mr Capocelli's boss, Giuliano Amato, the interior minister in Italy's centre-left government, and the prime minister, Romano Prodi, have spoken out against the burka. Mr Amato said last month that it \"offended the dignity of women\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
