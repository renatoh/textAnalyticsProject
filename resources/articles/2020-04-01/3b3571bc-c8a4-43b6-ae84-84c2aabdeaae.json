The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA\u2019s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut. Cruz said the UK\u2019s flag carrier airline, which has placed 22,600 people on the government\u2019s furlough scheme, \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely\u201d. \u201cYesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no \u2018normal\u2019 any longer,\u201d Cruz said in a letter to staff . \u201cWe are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.\u201d Cruz said the airline and its parent company International Airlines Group, had informed the government and its trade unions about its plans to cut jobs, and would begin a consultation period with staff and unions immediately. \u201cThis has been a difficult message to write and one I never thought I would need to send,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI know how tight-knit the BA family is, and how concerned you will be, not just for yourself but for your colleagues, too. We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.\u201d IAG said it had plunged to a loss of \u20ac535m (\u00a3465m) in the first three months of this year \u2013 with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of \u20ac135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of \u20ac1.3bn \u2013 the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed. IAG said BA had been hit hardest, with other airlines in the group \u2013 Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling \u2013 feeling less impact. Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa, said staff were devastated by the \u201cbolt out of the blue\u201d news and that the union would fight for every job. \u201cBA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways,\u201d he said. BA, he added, had \u201csaid it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.\u201d The leader of the Unite union described BA\u2019s decision as heartless, and a \u201cstab in the back\u201d, saying it was \u201centirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis\u201d. Len McCluskey said: \u201cTo reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement, is irresponsible, dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.\u201d Nadine Houghton, national officer of GMB, the union for British Airways ground staff, said: \u201cIf the 12,000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members. \u201cWe believed we had reached some relative, albeit temporary, respite for them following the agreement to furlough 80% of BA\u2019s staff \u2013 now this. \u201cI know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12,000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.\u201d The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule. When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures \u2013 which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard \u2013 will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before. The global airlines trade association, Iata, has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (\u00a3240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk. \u201cThis is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s director general, said last week. \u201cGovernments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won\u2019t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. \u201cWe could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit. And without urgent relief, many airlines will not survive to lead the economic recovery.\u201d Several airlines around the world are on the brink of collapse and many are urgently trying to secure government bailouts or emergency bank loans. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa is reportedly considering filing for creditor protection, as negotiations over state bailouts collapsed on Tuesday night. The airline is said to be burning through \u20ac1m of cash every hour, and has warned it will have 10,000 too many staff when it emerges from the crisis as a much smaller operator. The budget airline Norwegian has warned that virtually all of its fleet of aircraft will remain grounded until 2021 and is seeking to persuade shareholders to accept a government-backed rescue plan that will wipe out most of their investments. Virgin Atlantic is trying to find an investor to pump in millions to keep it afloat as it negotiates with the government for a \u00a3500m emergency loan. Virgin Australia collapsed into administration last week. Easyjet has borrowed \u00a3600m from the government under its Covid Corporate Financing Facility, allowing it to survive another nine months at the present rate of cash burn. In a statement to the stock market, IAG said: \u201cIn light of the impact of Covid-19 on current operations and the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years, British Airways is formally notifying its trade unions about a proposed restructuring and redundancy programme. \u201cThe proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways\u2019 employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
