The Climate Commission was set up in 2011 to provide accurate information on climate change to the Australian public. In that time we have published 27 reports, held over 20 public forums around Australia and delivering hundreds of speeches. We have met over 20,000 people face to face. Along with myself, the Commission was made up of a diverse range of experts: two of Australia\u2019s top climate scientists, professor Will Steffen and professor Lesley Hughes; the former chief of BP Australiasia, Gerry Hueston; economist and former head of the department of environment under the Howard government, Roger Beale; and an innovation expert, professor Veena Sahajwalla. The Commission was based on a simple idea: that Australians deserve to be informed about climate change and the implications for our health, economy and future. I firmly believe that Australians have a right a right to authoritative, independent, accurate information on climate change. We've just seen one of the earliest ever start to bushfire season in new South Wales following the hottest 12 months on record. Last summer was the hottest on record, breaking over 120 heat records across Australia. So unusual was the summer conditions that the Bureau of Meteorology added a new colour to the temperature map to cater for temperatures over 50 degrees. This is no trivial matter, as too often extreme weather events in Australia cause deaths, injuries and damage to property and infrastructure. As the climate heats, these events are becoming more frequent and severe. Whether it\u2019s emergency services, health services or the general public, there is a strong need for accurate information on climate change. This year the Climate Commission has spoken to over 1,500 emergency service personnel, thousands of nurses and thousands of local government representatives and workers. Our fire services must be prepared for increasing fire danger in Tasmania, Victoria, and some parts of NSW and SA. It is critical that our hospitals are prepared for increasing likelihood of heatwaves. Our coastal communities must prepare for increasing sea levels, while many agricultural communities must prepare for changing rainfall patterns. The Commission has not only been a resource for the public, but also a key resource for journalists to find independent information. There is a lot of spin and opinion in the discourse on climate change, and for the public to have a direct line to experts is crucial. Unfortunately, without the Climate Commission there will be less resources for journalists, and less information for the public. Scientists often have such depth to their knowledge that they can find it difficult to communicate with a non-expert. Too often we communicate in jargon, and lose people explaining things that are not relevant to them. Sometimes the community misses out on important information because the communication gulf between scientists and the community is too great. The Commission tried to present things in an accessible way. It is not about \u201cdumbing\u201d things down, but rather distilling complex information into what is most relevant for the public. Everywhere we\u2019ve been \u2013 from Mackay to Bunbury, from La Trobe valley to the capital cities \u2013 people are concerned about this issue, they want to understand it and know what to do about it. Overwhelmingly, Australians want to do the right thing, and want government and business to do the same. In recent weeks we\u2019ve received so many emails from people thanking us for our work. It is humbling and heartening. I know I speak for all the Commissioners when I say we will do our best to keep putting information out there. I think the power of the Climate Commission has been that we have constantly spoken out loudly and clearly about science-based facts. I see it as a moral imperative to continue the work I\u2019ve been doing for many years now: getting the message out and tell as many people as possible that climate change is happening, that it poses serious risks for Australia, and that strong action is required."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
