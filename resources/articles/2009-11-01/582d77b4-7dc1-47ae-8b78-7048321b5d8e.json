Any parent of a child issued with an asbo will automatically be required to take literacy and parenting classes, with the option of being moved into supported accommodation. While the average cost of intervention projects for every family is \u00a38,000-\u00a320,000 a year, the government says the scheme could save \u00a33bn over five years by cutting the cost of police, court and council action involved in dealing with the country's failing families. Figures from pilot schemes show that 82% of families referred to the projects were jobless, 76% had educational or learning problems, 66% had physical and mental health problems and 65% had poor parenting. Among the scheme's first 700 families, the number involved in four or more types of antisocial behaviour fell from 46% to 5%. Since the project was introduced in 170 centres in England three years ago, the Department for Children, Schools and Families estimates that about 2,600 families have taken part. Between October 2003 and September 2005, almost 1,000 parenting orders and contracts were issued. Research at Sheffield Hallam University on six family intervention projects showed complaints against the families fell by 82% and school attendance increased by 84%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
