Team GB, led by Luol Deng, the Chicago Bulls All-Star and former Brixton resident, went down 78-118 to the latest successors to the 1992 Dream Team who are led by LeBron James, the NBA MVP. Deng, who was the match's top scorer with 25 points, said: \"They're very good, the best team we've seen. For some of the guys it's the best they've played against. It's just very hard to keep [them] in check and in focus and physically you've got to be in top shape.\" This defeat came four days after an 86-66 win over Portugal and the GB coach, Chris Finch, said: \"It was a step back defensively, with our technical execution. But you can't put this team and Portugal in the same class.\" Too true. James, Kobe Bryant, owner of five Championship rings, and Carmelo Anthony, a five-times All-Star, are the headline acts in a gang whose multi-million dollar contracts and endorsements make them one-man corporations. After a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner an evening of high skill and off-court kitsch and razzmatazz that is the NBA \"product\" began. A packed Manchester Arena studded with domestic sport luminaries including Amir Khan, Darren Fletcher, Chris Smalling, Dereck Chisora, Danny Cipriani and Joleon Lescott watched as James and company took GB to school in the manner of the Dream Team of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird whose smallest winning margin was 36 points en route to sweeping the gold at the Barcelona Games. Tyson Chandler, an NBA champion with the Dallas Mavericks last year, before moving to the New York Knicks, won the first face-off against Joel Freedland, who is GB's only other NBA star, having just signed for the Portland Trail Blazers. After a James pass was intercepted Freedland moved up court to open the scoring. By the close of the opening 10 minutes the expected avalanche of points had arrived. Yet for nearly all of the first quarter played on these shores by a US men's team since the 1948 London Olympics, Deng's side stayed within two or three points. By the time the sides took a break it was 33-20 to the visitors but the crowd entertainment continued. The latest offering was a dance-off between three fans plucked from the crowd by NBA chaperones. This was won by an \"Alistair\" whose moves were limited but whose tender years earned him the loudest applause and so first prize. Next up in this Stateside cabaret was \"kiss-cam\" in which the Arena's close circuit screens homed in on a random pair of fans and invited them to get up close and personal. This giddiness was mirrored in the minutiae surrounding some of the players. While Deng was once the face of the Brixton Pound \u2013 a local currency in support of businesses \u2013 Anthony Davis, of the New Orleans Hornets, has a \"unibrow\" which he has trademarked. \"I don't want anyone to try to grow a unibrow because of me and then try to make money off of it,\" he told CNBC last month. \"Me and my family decided to trademark it because it's very unique.\" Alongside this in the miscellany file is the Tulsa World newspaper offering a cut-out of James Harden's beard for fans of the Oklahoma City Thunder shooting guard and Bryant's first name being taken from the beef from Japan after his parents saw it on a menu. To emerge from their group at the Olympics Team GB must win two games in a section that includes China, Brazil, Australia, Spain and the Russia Federation. Deng thinks they can: \"Yeah, we believe in each other.\" But achieve this and their likely opponents in the quarter-final will be James and his band of relentless winners. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2012 because it said, incorrectly, that Tyson Chandler was \"an NBA champion with the New York Nicks last year\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
