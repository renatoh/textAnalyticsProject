The Chilean has scored 11 Premier League goals this season since switching from the wings to a regular central position, including a hat-trick against West Ham United last weekend. But Wenger has admitted he doubted his own instincts that S\u00e1nchez could lead the line for Arsenal. \u201cI think he has found a good mixture,\u201d Wenger said, before Saturday\u2019s home match with Stoke City. \u201cHe knows when to come off and when to go in behind. He has more freedom and he takes advantage of his technique much more. He was happy out wide because in his head he was a wide player. But I had to persuade Thierry Henry as well. \u201cYou see that the guy who plays wide and can score goals can score even more goals in the centre. I always saw that in S\u00e1nchez. But I must honestly say that there were many times when I played him [in that position], last year or two years ago, that I thought I was wrong. The few experiences I attempted with him through the middle were not convincing and I remember even in one game I changed it at half-time.\u201d That game was at Everton at the start of the 2014-15 season when the \u00a331m S\u00e1nchez was a new arrival from Barcelona. Arsenal found themselves 2-0 down before half-time and S\u00e1nchez came off for Olivier Giroud. Giroud went on to snatch a late equaliser and earn a point for his side. But the Frenchman has had to make do with the substitutes\u2019 bench once more after a delayed return from Euro 2016 allowed S\u00e1nchez to assume his role in the team. Wenger says Giroud\u2019s situation is as much an issue of timing as anything else. With Giroud and S\u00e1nchez negotiating new contracts, Wenger has told his fellow Frenchman he must get used to the competition if he wants to stay at the club. \u201cAt the start of the season when S\u00e1nchez came back he took advantage of the fact Giroud was not here and not ready so I could give him more games,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cSometimes when you have too many people an experience that is not immediately conclusive cannot go on for too long because you are under pressure. If it doesn\u2019t work over one or two games and you have a top player on the bench, you\u2019re tempted to change it.\u201d Thanks to S\u00e1nchez\u2019s form and Giroud\u2019s absence, the experiment worked and Wenger says that times have changed. \u201cI want Giroud to stay, I want Giroud to extend his contract. He is a very important player at the club, on the pitch and off the pitch. I want him to stay but, if he signs, he has to live with the competition. He has to decide if he can live with what is going on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
