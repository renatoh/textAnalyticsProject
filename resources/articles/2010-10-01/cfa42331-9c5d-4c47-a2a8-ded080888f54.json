Quins had spent the first 50 minutes hanging on in a game that was dominated by Gloucester, but they clawed their way back from 26-13 down to 26-26 with 10 minutes to go. A yellow card for each of the Gloucester props helped, but the way Quins capitalised on their hosts' disadvantage in those 20 minutes was worthy of the unlikely draw they appeared to have earned. But Gloucester regrouped and their No8, Brett Deacon, scored from an attacking scrum with three minutes to go. Quins launched a final, multi-phase attack that ended with their captain, Chris Robshaw, being driven over the line in the left-hand corner with time up on the clock. The referee, Tim Wigglesworth, paused, remembered there was no video referee to help him and chose not to award the try that the Quins players were adamant they had scored. Nick Evans, who, like his opposite number, Nicky Robinson, had not missed a kick all day, was thus denied the chance to re-secure that draw with a touchline conversion. \"You saw the incredulity among the players at the end,\" O'Shea said. \"When they were looking around saying, 'What's going on?' They all said the ball was over the line. I wouldn't sit here and lie to you \u2013 ever.\" Now that around 50% of Premiership matches are televised and thus presided over by a video referee, is it an injustice that the other 50% are not? \"I think this is going to be the tightest Premiership for a long, long time. At the end of the season every point is going to count,\" O'Shea said. Yes, but is it unfair? \"We talk about controllables. I'm sure there are people who will say it should be looked at, but we don't control that. We'll go away with our point, focus on Bath and get our win at home next week.\" Never let it be said that O'Shea is not in control of his tongue. He made his point, indeed, without giving the disciplinary police anything to get him on. Now, imagine if he had been Brendan Venter ...
