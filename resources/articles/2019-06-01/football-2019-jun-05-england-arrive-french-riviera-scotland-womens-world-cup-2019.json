Phil Neville\u2019s squad checked into their hotel on the Promenade des Anglais on Tuesday night to be greeted by a mix of local dignitaries and schoolchildren singing a specially adapted version of Three Lions. Its familiar lyrics have become something of an anthem of failure for England men\u2019s teams over the years, serving as a soundtrack to assorted disappointments, but the Lionesses believe they can transform the song into a triumphal march over the coming weeks. Before banishing all those \u201cyears of hurt\u201d, though, they could do with beating Scotland here on Sunday in a game Jill Scott believes could define their tournament. Win and England will be on course to finish top of Group D and looking at a relatively straightforward passage to the semi-finals. Lose or draw and the prospect of scrabbling to secure second spot and consequently a much trickier route to the latter stages beckons. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest games of our lives,\u201d says the Manchester City midfielder. Considering Scott is embarking on her fourth World Cup and is not really given to hyperbole that is quite some statement but she knows Shelley Kerr\u2019s side are almost unrecognisable from the one England thrashed 6-0 in the opening match of Euro 2017 in the Netherlands. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we don\u2019t get lost in the emotion of the occasion,\u201d Scott says. \u201cWe have to stay logical and remember it\u2019s just a game of football.\u201d The amount of heavy security, featuring abundant armed police, guarding England\u2019s training base on the outskirts of Nice necessitated visitors undergoing airport-style screening while negotiating considerable French bureaucracy. The landscape felt radically different from the relaxed atmosphere of the last World Cup in Canada four years ago. While threats of terrorist attacks have left France on high alert, England know there can be no room for complacency when they kick off against radically altered opponents on Sunday. \u201cI played in the 6-0 but I haven\u2019t even thought about that game, which probably shows how much I think this one is going to be completely different,\u201d she says. \u201cScotland didn\u2019t have the experience they have now. I definitely think it\u2019ll be a much tighter affair than the last one.\u201d Jennifer Beattie, Scotland\u2019s key centre\u2011half, missed Euro 2017 through injury but has arrived in Nice fully fit. \u201cJennifer\u2019s one of my best friends at Manchester City,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cI remember once last season she had a bad back and I said, \u2018Just look after yourself\u2019. And then I said, \u2018No, maybe you should overtrain so you\u2019ll be knackered for the summer. We had a bit of banter but Scotland\u2019s definitely not a straightforward game. It\u2019s going to be difficult and we\u2019re going to have to fight for the right to get the ball down and play. It\u2019s important we get that win, so we\u2019ve got to have the right mindset.\u201d It has been announced England will play a friendly against Germany at Wembley on 9 November, as the Lionesses build up to Euro 2021, which they are hosting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
