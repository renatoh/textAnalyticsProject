This will be little consolation to the horses who died. It is also illogical \u2013 it doesn't matter how much emphasis there is on welfare if deaths nevertheless result. Wood also (Comment, 11 April) says we should not judge a sport on one race a year. He says we would not make sweeping judgments about injury rates in football by watching a single match. This too is illogical \u2013 if the National is the only race where such tragedies occur then abolish only the National. If in that single match there were two deaths, albeit of animals, I would wish to investigate further. Many horses die in racing each year. Of course there are risks in most sports and jockeys may also suffer, but they have rather more choice in the matter than their mounts. Joseph Cocker Leominster, Herefordshire \u2022 At last a mainstream discussion is opening up about the Grand National. Every year there are deaths on this deliberately punishing and hazardous course, and for too long they have been swept under the carpet so as not to detract from the event's glossy image and lessen the huge profits amassed by the racing and betting industries. We all love a good spectacle, but there is no need for animal abuse to be part of it. Sharon Howe Sidmouth, Devon \u2022 I read with interest the comments of the chairman of Faace (Fight Against Animal Cruelty in Europe), who would like us to think about what we \"are putting the horses through\". However, I have yet to see Faace's stern, wrinkled brow in my part of France. My nationality makes me a representative of all things Britannique and my French racing industry acquaintances hold me personally responsible for the increased levels of wastage (young stock entering the food chain) since la crise hit banks and economies. In fact, all over Europe buyers have been bolting like billyo. Irish producers have also reported that their abattoirs are doing an equally brisk trade, accounting for some 46,000 equines who were \"bred in the purple\" and originally destined for the track, not the table. Racing is wringing its hands enough, Faace. Leave off all this busy-bodying about the National and get a sense of proportion. If you care about horse welfare, get into Europe properly. I don't see you yet in our abattoirs, our long-haul lairages and our fairgrounds. Lesley Jolly La Nocle-Maulaix, France \u2022 Why, in Sam Jones's article is there no mention of the disqualification given to the jockey, Jason Maguire, for excessive use of the whip? Whipping a tired horse is not a good example from a country supporting animal welfare. CM Gunstone Brinlow, Rugby \u2022 The letter above was amended on 13 April. Due to an editing error, the original suggested that the ban referred to was not related to the Grand National."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
