Nicolas Anelka: no goals since 3 November. Florent Malouda: only one since 23 October. Drogba, who scored 38 for club and country in 2009-10: one goal in eight games since 3 November. In six matches from 14 August Chelsea stuffed 25 past West Brom, Wigan, Stoke, West Ham, Zilina and Blackpool, and Carlo Ancelotti's side seemed to be cartwheeling towards another Premier League title. Now: one win in six league games and the return of political intrigue in the house of Abramovich has left Ancelotti confessing: \"I'm not happy in my job at the moment. I'm searching for the right way to do better.\" A team is a machine and when one part breaks down it can make the others conk out. Ancelotti is accustomed to fielding questions about having Roman Abramovich's hot breath on his neck and the Ray Wilkins sacking but has yet to explain why such a prolific side have turned so goal-shy. Sunday brings a visit to Spurs and both Manchester United and Arsenal must be faced in the next fortnight. Without a restoration of their confident, breezy style, Chelsea's defence of the title could be broken by the new year. To avert such an embarrassing start to 2011 they need their three forwards to reclaim the attacking potency that prompted many analysts to think Ancelotti's best XI is superior to that of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's, always the measuring stick at Stamford Bridge. \"There's not just one reason. First I think Didier is not 100% fit,\" Ancelotti says. \"He had malaria and that caused a fitness problem. He's not quick enough at the moment. From the back we are too slow and when we arrive in front [in the attacking third of the pitch] there is no space for the final ball. If we look at the game against Birmingham [which they lost 1-0] we had maybe 10 or 11 chances to score. We miss the last pass and the shot. This is the third reason: more focus when we shoot.\" This technical summation of the collapse in the goalscoring department chimes with the dramatic slowing down and growing imprecision in Chelsea's play. \"We have to use the training session to improve our defensive positions,\" Ancelotti says. \"We are not good enough in possession because it's not clean and quick. We have to improve this.\" Behind this diagnosis lurk all kinds of psychological and political complications, some of which reflect the loss of Frank Lampard since August and the absences of John Terry and Michael Essien for four weeks until the 1-1 draw with Everton. With Essien, Chelsea have played 12 league games and won nine. Without him, they have failed to win in four. All around the club these days you can sense Abramovich's hand on the wheel. The periods when oligarchical interference is at its height are the ones to be endured. The suspicion is that those who manage the club wait for him to drift off again so they can all get back to business. Abramovich can hardly be expected to cop the blame for the 3-0 home defeat to Sunderland or the midweek Champions League defeat at Marseille \u2013 but Ancelotti appears increasingly inclined to explain himself to his employer. \"I have a constant relationship with him because he wants to be involved in what happens in the squad,\" he says of Abramovich. \"At the moment it's not good and he wants it to be good. \"He never asks me to change something. He's happy for me to manage the team. I like to explain to him how I took decisions. I like to explain. It's a duty.\" A former employee of Silvio Berlusconi, at Milan, Ancelotti is accustomed to stroking plutocratic egos but here in England it would be anathema for Sir Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to talk to a mere owner as a footballing equal (Brian Clough and Abramovich would have made a good match, in the pyrotechnical sense). With one eye on the sky for descending helicopters, Ancelotti fixes his main gaze on the training ground for signs that the pace and purpose of last season's Double winners has not disappeared for good. \"These players have strong personalities, they want to stay at the top, they want to stay protagonists in this season,\" he insists. \"They want to stay the top players in the world. This is their motivation. It's not enough to earn money. For every one of us \u2013 we are not here for money,\" Reassuringly, for students of \"no-holds-barred\" sit-downs, a truth-telling conference has indeed taken place. Ancelotti says: \"We had a meeting. Very clear. We explained everything. Everyone agreed. Now it's not enough to speak, we have to act. \"Sometimes in your life you have to take a risk. Now we have to take a risk. I'm happy to play against Tottenham. It could be the most difficult game at the moment because Tottenham at home are very strong. [Gareth] Bale is uncontrollable. Very quick. You could lose your mind. I'm happy to play against him \u2013 but I don't know whether [right-back] Paulo Ferreira is.\" This far into the drought the three senior strikers can no longer blame midfield sterility. \"I'm not angry with the players but I'm not happy,\" their leader says. \"It's not my character to be angry with the players. If you shout every time nobody listens. Sometimes I shout. This month \u2013 more than once.\" They had better get \"switched on for Christmas\", or a long darkness could descend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
