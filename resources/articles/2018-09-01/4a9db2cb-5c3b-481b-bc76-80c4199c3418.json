You know what that means. Punk and disco. The birth of hip-hop. Sexual liberation and narcotic recreation. Second-wave feminism and the musical Beatlemania. A perfect time to return to the Deuce, then. In episode nine (not season two, episode one, that would be too conventional) we return to mid-town Manhattan five years after we left it. Vince is still with Abbie, and between them they run the Hi-Hat (now a punk venue) and Club 366 (disco), as well as looking over former bartender Paul\u2019s gay bar. They do this all on behalf of the mob. Frankie, Vinnie\u2019s elder brother, is still around, too, losing money to the bookies and still grafting from the till in his porn shop whenever the need takes him. Eileen continues to go by the name Candy, but is some way clear of her days as a sex worker. This contrast is made clear to us in the very first scene, as we watch Candy weave through the midnight streets as before, but this time in a fancy fur coat and with pedestrians whispering excitedly: \u201cIt\u2019s really her!\u201d as she passes. Eileen is now a film-maker and actor, and though those films are porn films, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not artful, as we learn from her heated exchange with producer Harvey over an expressionistic orgasm scene. In general, life appears good for people in the porn industry. For women in particular, the change in circumstances is striking. Like Eileen, Lori is in a very different place. She is a porn star, with her face on movie posters. Her reputation is such that a threat to walk out on a set can double her money. That threat is made by CC, Lori\u2019s charismatic and ruthless pimp, but the dynamic between the pair appears to have changed. CC still threatens his girl, but Lori is no longer cowed. \u201cYou\u2019re like a fur coat or a Tiffany necklace \u2026 know who you are,\u201d he tells her. \u201cI\u2019m a whore, CC, you made that particularly clear on the set today,\u201d she replies. While the words repeat the old dynamic, the tone suggests different \u2026 that the balance of power has changed. For the pimps, whose descent from the top of The Deuce\u2019s food chain began some time ago, their fortunes are mixed. CC is doing well, thanks to Lori, but still hankers for the days of \u201cregular\u201d johns who gave him money and control. Larry, a degree more compassionate and with a sexual allure of his own, is seen only briefly, in a bohemian apartment, but he, too, has a porn actor in Darlene (continuing her path of self-improvement through education) and a clutch of new girls under his wing. Rodney, meanwhile, the man who seems to believe he was born to pimp \u2013 and had spent so much time trying to take Candy on to his books \u2013 is struggling outside the movie business and with a growing drug problem of his own. On the other side of the law is police officer Chris Alston. He has perhaps changed more than anyone else between episodes eight and nine, and the change is a pleasing one. When we first met Alston, he was a beat cop, forced to enact a policy for the deterrence of vice he neither sympathised with nor believed to be productive. By 1977, Alston, a black cop in a white police force, has made it to the murder squad. His low-key scepticism has been replaced by chest-out confidence. He has power and influence. He is making a difference. He has sunglasses that look like Kojak\u2019s. There are others who are still around, from Vinnie\u2019s irascible brother-in-law and brothel keeper Bobby to mafiosi Rudy Papilo. But life on the Deuce has changed, too. Alston is forcibly introduced to Gene Goldman, a representative of Ed Koch, the man who is to become New York\u2019s mayor and ramp up the gentrification of the city, especially Times Square. Alston also has a new girlfriend, a nurse. Frankie has a new business partner, the wiry Irene, and a new wife, Christina Fuego (\u201cit\u2019s Spanish for fire\u201d). Chauncey has taken over duties at the diner while his uncle Leon serves time for killing Reggie Love. The themes remain the same; not surprising, given that they\u2019re eternal: love and sex, pleasure and commerce, men and women, rich and poor, white and black. All set against the backdrop of a creative explosion (which another, less successful, HBO drama, Vinyl, also attempted to capture). So welcome back to the Deuce \u2013 and this time there\u2019s a murder to solve. Discotheque bibliotheque David Simon and George Pelecanos wrote this opening episode and they\u2019re never shy of the odd bit of cultural allusion. The music playing over the opening credits is Elvis Costello\u2019s This Year\u2019s Girl (actually released in 1978). There\u2019s also music from Barry White and bits of disco (and punk as performed by one of Abbie\u2019s bands) that you may be able to recognise. There\u2019s reference to Saturday Night Fever, out that year, and its protagonist, Tony Manero, is Frankie\u2019s latest style inspiration. Chris compares his girlfriend to Pam Grier and reminisces over a scene in Foxy Brown (1974). There\u2019s discussion of the editing techniques in Easy Rider (1969). Most touchingly, as it\u2019s picked out in detail to give us a greater sense of Darlene\u2019s involved relationship with literature, there\u2019s an appearance for Toni Morrison\u2019s Song of Solomon, released that year and later cited when Morrison won the Nobel Prize for literature. There will be other bits I\u2019ve missed too, I\u2019m sure. Questions for next week Is Rodney going to maintain his fresh appearance for much longer? Are the women in the porn industry experiencing emancipation or just another type of oppression? Does Bobby ever do any work? Will Frankie\u2019s coke habit come back and bite him, or will the kid continue to be lucky? Who\u2019s the boy who rowed with the murder victim?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
