It's hard to believe, what with disasters striking the world from Cancun to Stockholm, that the most important questions on the American public's mind are whether Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have broken up, or whether they still want to tie the knot if only they could find a safe and secure location - something everyone seems to be looking for these days. There are many fabulous details that the public, steeped in the hyper-marketed machinations of the dream machine, now claim as their own. I'm astonished that I never knew any of this stuff before. I never knew, for example, that J-Lo has her very own fashion line, just like the celebrity she played in her movie breakthrough, Selena. All you have to do is click on shopjlo.com and you, too, can be the happy owner of a \"Jennifer Lopez mesh top\". I never knew that she has brought out her own fragrance, \"Glow\". Like a contestant on some TV game show, telephoning stay-at-home pals for advice, I've begun to turn to friends for coaching on pop culture. Only last night, a fellow guest at a dinner party helpfully informed me that \"Glow\" has the scent of dandelion weeds crossed with 1960s hippie musk oil. Ben is a less diversified brand. No clothing line, no scent. However, he can boast some extra publicity these days from an off-Broadway play running in New York's East Village. Titled Matt and Ben, it is a vicious little satire performed by two twenty-something Dartmouth grads, Mindy Kaling and Brenda Withers, who leapfrog right over gender to impersonate Affleck and Matt Damon on the brink of fame, as they struggle to write a screen play to make them rich and famous. In the Kaling/ Withers version, the pair do not write their celebrated Good Will Hunting script. Instead, it falls from the ceiling, striking their heads literally with inspiration and leading them to cancel their planned Catcher in the Rye adaptation. Soon, Kaling's Ben gets the idea of dating Latin women once he's famous. Well, he's famous now, and so is she, and together they're the most famous of all. And why do we care? Or, to put it more accurately, why do they care? They, the audiences around the globe, who want more and more of Bennifer, the Ben and Jennifer hook-up that sells magazines, newspapers, and cable shows with breaking news. The obsession is not actually so mysterious: the American public believes in its celebrities precisely because it doesn't believe in anything else. As old values have seeped away, as consumerism has become a diminished fantasy in the midst of a recession, as old employers and family members betray and disappoint, the public turns to stars for reassurance and, dare I say, redemption. If movies are the new religion, then cinematic celebrities form the new firmament, dazzling us with their glamour and receiving our worship as simply their due. It's not just an American phenomenon any more: the cultural transmission machine has worked such wonders that everyone can sign on to the same displacement and pay attention to the same pantheon of distorted stars, a glam globalisation campaign of denial and fetishism. With less and less to grasp on to in a world spinning out of control, celebrity-worship offers a revival tent of belief. It soothes the faithful with reports of pink diamonds and jewel-encrusted toilet seats, two of the gifts the reluctant bridegroom bequeathed to his bride. Maybe the monarchy is failing, and the GNP is ailing, but never fear, dear, Ben and Jen are here. Were they ever a good match? Jenny from the block and Benny from the square, a bad girl and a bad boy, teaming up to reformat their images. Or was it a publicity courtship, a stunt to maximise box office returns, like the ploys of the studios back in the days of Rock Hudson? Affleck stood to gain respectability again as a suave ladies' man, after emerging from rehab and from disapproval for dumping America's sweetheart, Gwyneth Paltrow. Lopez stood to gain respectability, too, and shed the gangster's-moll image of criminality still shadowing her from the P Diddy days. No more thug, no more drunk, just two young 'uns in love. Gee, isn't that a nice fantasy? A great script? Too bad they're both brands in need of reformatting. This week alone, my computer has updated me on the marital front - asserting that Affleck, allegedly bald and wearing a toupee, consulted his old pal Damon who told him to ditch the matrimony game and dump his Latina lovely; or, alternately, that Lopez, who patronises a Santeria priestess in Los Angeles, sought advice and was told to dump the Yank and call off the ceremony. Whether Affleck and Lopez go splitsville or decide to try their hand at a happy-ever-after script, it's the fawning faithful who have a lot to answer for. Is this massive investment in two fair-to-middling personalities a dodge, a case of escapism equal to the Depression-era investment in big-budget musicals? Is it a case of denial, holding fast to movie fantasies so as to avoid what passes for the real world entirely? Or just simple wish-fulfillment, trading in the stresses of modern life for a glossier parallel reality? Perhaps the Bennifer mania really is a form of celluloid fundamentalism, a fully realised faith, its form of communion transpiring in the darkness of the theatre, not a cathedral, but transubstantiating nonetheless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
