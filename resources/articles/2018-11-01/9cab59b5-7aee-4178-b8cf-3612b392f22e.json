The announcement of the full lineup promises the most diverse festival to date. Across the four competition categories, 42% of directors are women, 39% are people of colour and 23% identify as LGBT. Within the documentary strand lies Knock Down the House, a look at the movement of four female insurgent candidates challenging incumbents during the recent midterm elections, including Ocasio-Cortez. It sits alongside Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn?, a look at the \u201cdark arts\u201d of the influential lawyer and his connection to Donald Trump, as well as Untouchable, the inside story of the rise and fall of Harvey Weinstein. There are also a number of films with a political bent, including the Steven Soderbergh-produced thriller The Report, the story of Daniel Jones, lead investigator for the Senate\u2019s study into the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program. The film stars Adam Driver, Jon Hamm and Annette Bening as Dianne Feinstein. The story of the British intelligence whistleblower Katharine Gun will also be brought to the festival in Official Secrets starring Keira Knightley. Gun leaked a top-secret NSA memo before the 2003 Iraq invasion that showed officials proposing the blackmail of other states to vote for war. The festival will also see the premiere of The Infiltrators, a drama about a group of undocumented youths who infiltrate a shadowy for-profit detention centre. One of the most buzzed about films to launch in January is the Ted Bundy drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile from the Emmy-winning documentary film-maker Joe Berlinger. It stars Zac Efron as the killer but will be told through the viewpoint of his girlfriend Liz, played by Lily Collins. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really glorify Ted Bundy,\u201d Efron said earlier this year. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a person to be glorified. It simply tells a story and sort of how the world was able to be charmed over by this guy who was notoriously evil and the vexing position that so many people were put in, the world was put in. It was fun to go and experiment in that realm of reality.\u201d Other big names set to grace Park City, Utah include Emma Thompson, who stars as a late-night talkshow host in Late Night opposite Mindy Kaling; Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams, who headline the comedy After the Wedding; Viola Davis, who will appear in a 70s-set coming of age drama Troupe Zero; Jake Gyllenhaal, who re-teams with his Nightcrawler director Tony Gilroy for the art world thriller Velvet Buzzsaw; and fresh from her Oscar-buzzed role in The Favourite, Olivia Colman will head to Sundance with a role in snake-handling church drama Them That Follow. Bend it Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha will also premiere her 80s-set coming-of-age musical comedy Blinded by the Light about a teenager finding his voice with the help of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s music. \u201cHaving been at the [Sundance] lab as a writer, being a mentor at the directors lab and now having the world premiere here of Blinded by the Light, a film that took eight years in the making, means the world to me,\u201d she said of the film that received Springsteen\u2019s blessing. \u201cAt a time when the world has so many divisive voices, Sundance offers us the greatest home to deliver our movie and its message of oneness to the world.\u201d Traditionally, Sundance has become a major launching pad for smaller films, with last year\u2019s festival hosting premieres for Hereditary, Eighth Grade and Sorry to Bother You. Next year\u2019s festival will take place from 24 January to 3 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
