Wright of Derby belonged not to the polite world of aristocratic art - his attempt to set up as a posh portraitist in Bath failed - but the regional middle class. He was the son of a Derby lawyer and spent most of his career there, sharing the intellectual interests of Midlands industrialists such as Josiah Wedgwood his An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768) at the National Gallery depicts people transfixed by the theatre of science. Wright trained in London then went to Italy, apparently eloping with a bride of whom his family disapproved. There he painted fiery night vistas of Vesuvius and a firework display in Rome. He finally settled back in Derby where prosperous industrialists and enlightened landowners took to his grand, European manner in portraits and landscapes. Subject: Brooke Boothby, a Derbyshire landowner and intellectual. Boothby was involved in the thriving literary community of Lichfield in Staffordshire, the birthplace of Samuel Johnson. In 1766-7 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, prophet of the cult of nature, stayed in Staffordshire while in exile from France, and Boothby was part of the enlightened circles in which he was feted. In the late 1770s Boothby visited him in Paris and was presented with Rousseau's autobiography in manuscript in 1780 Boothby published, in Lichfield, the posthumous first French edition of the First Dialogue of Rousseau Juge de Jean Jacques. Distinguishing features: Brooke Boothby lies, punningly, beside a brook, opening himself up to nature. His pose, finger to his face, suggests a delicate sensibility. It's a flamboyant departure from the conventions of the society portrait in which people in wigs would sit or stand authoritatively - they certainly didn't lie down. Boothby's relaxation is an act of intimacy with the viewer. He has nothing to hide or hold back. He is as pure as a rustic stream, not in society but in nature that is, he rejects the formal and indirect relationships of cultivated modern life in favour of a direct and authentic act of communion, as if this were the Golden Age and we were all shepherds together. As if his pose did not make this plain enough, in an untamed woodland with open country and the glowing sky behind him, he holds a work by Rousseau, whose arguments for simple living and a return to nature shook 18th-century Europe and were holy writ for the French Revolution. People read a lot in 18th-century art. Reading is an image of introspection, and Rousseau was a man dedicated to promoting feeling and sensitivity through books. The edition of Rousseau on which Boothby rests his gloved hand - presumably the book he himself published - is a sensual object, bound in calf skin, a book not of hard facts but tender emotions. Through this book we are invited to see the landscape itself as loving and meaningful, a place to dream and escape the shallow world of the city. Yet if Brooke Boothby is an early Romantic, he is not any kind of savage, noble or otherwise. He is a gentleman, fashionably dressed in broad-brimmed hat, ruffled collar and elegant suit. Any sentiment Boothby espouses will be a well-dressed one and the revolution will not overturn standards of tailoring. Inspirations and influences: The influence of Rousseau runs through 18th-century portraits, from Elisabeth Vigee Le Brun's depictions of Marie Antoinette and her courtiers playing at pastoral, to a painting that might be seen as the final apocalyptic translation of the emotional openness displayed here - David's The Death of Marat (1793), in which the assassinated Jacobin leader is seen lying in his bath.
