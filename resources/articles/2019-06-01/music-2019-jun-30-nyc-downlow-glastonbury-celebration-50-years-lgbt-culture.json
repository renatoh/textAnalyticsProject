It is 50 years since the Stonewall riots, when the boozers at a New York gay bar decided that they had been hassled one too many times. When the cops raided it, they fought back. That night sparked the modern LGBT rights movement \u2013 which some may say took a while to arrive at Glastonbury. It wasn\u2019t until 2007 that gay culture found full-throated expression, in the shape of the NYC Downlow, a meticulous recreation of a sleazy 70s gay club, complete with drag queens, go-go dancers and even a darkroom round the back of the speakers, for those who would like an intimate moment soundtracked by pulverising house music served up by DJs including Midland and Eric Morillo. In the 12 years since, it has become the highlight of the Block9 area, a haven of after-hours partying. On Sunday night, the Downlow is due to mark the Stonewall anniversary with a show by the performer Jonny Woo, who promises 60s drag, a communal listen to Judy Garland\u2019s Over the Rainbow (Garland\u2019s death a few days earlier was said by some to have triggered the riot in 1969) and a moment in which he will say: \u201cIt\u2019s 50 years; we\u2019ve come this far. Look at the rights that you have and the sacrifices that people made, the lives lost, the shit that people went through, and remember the work that still needs to be done.\u201d There may also be a surprise performance by a pop star: Kylie Minogue and Miley Cyrus are rumoured; both are due to play the Pyramid stage earlier in the day. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding that moment in the madness where we come together for a minute, do a big show and then get off our tits,\u201d says Woo. NYC Downlow is a space where queer culture is celebrated, says its co-creator Gideon Berger. \u201cOur music, our culture, our identity \u2013 the Downlow is trying to create a space for that to be revered.\u201d There\u2019s another side-effect, too, he laughs: \u201cHot straight trade in the darkroom.\u201d The retro ambience pays homage to a golden age of gay creativity, but it also serves as a reminder of more repressive times. \u201cThe Downlow aims to repoliticise gays,\u201d Berger says. \u201cIt\u2019s about saying: \u2018Come on then \u2013 we\u2019ve got a good thing going here, but look at our brothers and sisters being stoned to death or pushed off buildings in the rest of the world.\u201d It is also a reminder that, as well as good times, nightspots have provided refuge and community to gay people going right back to Stonewall itself \u2013 safe spaces that are more necessary than ever, with backlashes against the gains of the LGBT movement never far away. \u201cNightclubs are political spaces,\u201d says Woo. \u201cYou\u2019ve got permission to express yourself, chill out and forget what society tells you are the acceptable ways of behaviour. If you come to Downlow, you can chuck that out of the window.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
