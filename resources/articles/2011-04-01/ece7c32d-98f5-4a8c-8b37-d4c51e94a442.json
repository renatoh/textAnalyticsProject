Many of my colleagues claimed it was the first time in history that one foreign high official visited any football game which wasn't the finale of some big competition. I am pretty sure they are wrong, but I hope that you could help me prove it to them.\" Putin's visit to the Red Star Stadium is an interesting one. The club report that 25,000 fans turned up to watch the game between the two youth teams (a decent gate, and possibly a record for a youth team friendly, although not quite matching some of the crowds at senior level), while the Russian PM watched the game in the company of some unusual acquaintances \u2013 a group of Macedonian and Serbian bikers. \"Having met each other for the first time at a bike show in Sevastopol last year,\" records the Russian government's website, \"Putin and the bikers exchanged cordial greetings and went to watch the football game. \"The fans at the stadium greeted the Russian prime minister with a storm of applause, waving Russian flags and chanting 'Russia.' Some fans even held Putin's portrait. After the announcement that Putin was in the stadium, the fans began singing Katyusha, a popular Soviet wartime song, while setting off flares.\" And, as this footage shows, that's not spin \u2026 Speaking of spin, here's Alister Campbell (no, not that one), with another football-loving Russian: \"The Russian prime minister, Alexander Kosygin, was visiting Scotland in 1967, and on 11 February, he was presented to the players on the pitch pre-match at Kilmarnock v Rangers before watching the game.\" To be fair to Kosygin, he probably needed to unwind. As the Guardian reported before his visit: \"He will have five rounds of talks with Harold Wilson before leaving on Friday evening for a brief visit to Scotland where he will see the Hunsterson nuclear power station and watch the Kilmarnock versus Rangers football match.\" Talks with the PM, visit to nuclear power station, trip to Rugby Park \u2013 all in a weekend's work. But it's not just the big men from Moscow who have enjoyed the beautiful game on foreign shores. \"King Alphonso XIII of Spain was at Stamford Bridge on 1 November 1919 to watch Chelsea beat Bradford Park Avenue 4-0 in a run of the mill Division One match,\" writes Warren Lyons. \"It was perhaps not all that bizarre given his fondness for football. It was his patronage that led to the \"Real\" in the names of Real Madrid, Real Betis and Real Sociedad.\" More recently, Bertie Ahern was a regular visitor to Old Trafford while Taoiseach of Ireland, while mystery surrounds an intriguing visit by King Olav V of Norway to Selhurst Park. Kevin Burgess reports that: \"It was in the 1970s, we were in the old third division,\" but the club's press office could find no reference of the Nordic visitor and even the mighty tool that is Twitter struggled to stir up anything other than vague recollections (thanks to @mikesinnerton and @ChristopherHarv). There's even some doubt as to whether he visited Britain at all in the 70s. If any Norwegian Eagles out there (or, even better, regal Norwegian Eagles) can shed any further light then please get in touch at the usual address. APRIL FOOLS (2) Last week we looked at some of the 'best' April Fools' Day japes from the world of football. And, yes, we all had a good laugh. But, as Gretna discovered in 2007, not everyone can see the funny side. The club sent out a press release reporting that striker Kenny Deuchar, a qualified doctor, had landed a part on Holby City. The Carlisle News &amp; Star ran the false story on page four, while the Cumbrian Gazette splashed the news on their front page. \"Kenny Deuchar is a real character \u2013 there are not many doctors who are also professional footballers, and him landing a bit-part in Holby City was completely believable,\" fumed News &amp; Star deputy editor Richard Eccles after the hoax had been exposed. \"We couldn't believe it actually got printed,\" replied Gretna. Another creative effort came in Denmark in 1997. \"Following this late equaliser, which Brian Laudrup had scored a few days before in a very windy stadium in a World Cup qualifying match against Croatia,\" begins Henrik Nielsen, \"It was explained in the news that the Croatian FA had complained to the Uefa, claiming that the seldom used 'following wind clause' in the Uefa rules should be applied, as the goal was scored with a following wind of more than 15 metres per second, and would otherwise not have been possible. The 1-1 result of the match was therefore likely to be reconsidered, and the Danish qualification for the tournament was in jeopardy.\" More conventional that wind clauses and bit-parts in BBC dramas are the false transfer stories. Several Icelanders fell for the Bylgjan radio station's \"Diego Maradona to FC Fram\" story in 1991 (one, as Stefan Palsson recounts, involving a drugs ban loophole and the promise of playing for free for the club), Shoot magazine's front cover carried a picture of Ian Rush in an Everton shirt in the late 1980s, while Michael Deegan recalls the moment in 1995 when an Irish tabloid revealed that Shelbourne were set to sign a female player. \"Supposedly signed from Arsenal Ladies, this 'current Dutch International' was going to be seen as a watershed in talent acquisition. And the name of the footballer in question? 'Avril De Foyst.'\" 0-0 MARATHONS \"My team, Charlton Athletic, are currently on a run of 73 games without a goalless draw,\" wrote Jon Laysell last week. \"Is this a record?\" Sadly Addicks fans, it is not. Welsh Premier League side Cefn Druids went without a 0-0 from March 2006 to March 2010. \"Their run came to a rather unlikely end when they held eventual champions The New Saints to a goalless draw at Plas Kynaston,\" writes Seiriol Hughes. \"The Druids were relegated at the end of the season, but the oldest club in Wales are having a better time of it this season at their new home, The Rock, and have a good chance of promotion back to the Welsh top flight this year.\" But the Druids' record is under threat. \"A quick peak at the back of a Ladbrokes coupon (they show all manner of stats there) shows that Elgin City are currently on a run of 102 matches without a 0-0,\" writes Mark Wilson. Keep an eye on those Badgers. TEAMS GO DOWN, GATES GO UP (2) Controversy abounds after last week's look at record third tier attendances. \"I think that Alex Hannick was wrong to say that the Sheffield Boxing Day Massacre had the record attendance for a third tier league match in England,\" writes Jim Nicholson. \"Hull City's home match at Boothferry Park against Rotherham United, on Christmas Day 1948, in the Third Division (North) had an attendance of 49,655 \u2013 which is 346 more than the match in Sheffield. Not as many as the matches in Dusseldorf, Naples and Brazil mentioned \u2013 but it is one of the few English football records that the mighty Tigers can lay claim to.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Is Bhaichung Bhutia's six-month ban for joining India's version of Strictly Come Dancing the strangest reason for a suspension in football history?\" mused Ben Peters back in the sepia-tinged days of 2009. \"While the list of footballers suspended due to incidents involving drinking is not a short one, I think the one involving Saudi footballer Saeed al-Owairan is one of the more extreme,\" writes Tom McGovern. And he's not wrong. Al-Owairan, who scored the goal of the tournament during the 1994 World Cup against Belgium, would be punished for a decadent Western lifestyle which contravened the strict Islamic law of Saudi Arabia. First up, he left his club, Al Shabab, without permission for a two-week holiday in Morocco in 1995. Then, early the following year, he was spotted by the Saudi police cavorting with a group of women \u2013 including some non-Saudis \u2013 and flung in jail. \"It wasn't like a jail, jail,\" said a surprisingly chipper Al-Owairan at a later date. \"It was a detention centre, and I was held for questioning for several weeks.\" Other reports claimed Al-Owairan was undercooking the story slightly, and that his incarceration lasted for \"a little longer than six months\". The player was eventually released, and though he would be banned from football for a year, he did represent Saudi Arabia again, at the 1998 World Cup.

Regular goalkeeper Antony Hall was dismissed last weekend, further to the sending off of his brother Michael during a cup match earlier in the season. It was Antony himself who suggested this might be a record, and I'd be interested to see if he's correct.\" \"Finland sacked their manager Stuart Baxter after less than stellar performances last year,\" notes Mikko Pyykko. \"Caretaker Olli Huttunen led one game against the sorry San Marino side which the Finns duly won by 8-0. Is Huttunen the most successful international manager in average goals scored by his team?\" \"I remember as a boy watching Match of the Day one Saturday in the late 1970s and seeing a young goalkeeper, who'd had an absolute howler of a game, in tears and being carried off the pitch shoulder high by the opposing team,\" writes David Brydon. \"For no good reason I've always thought the game was QPR v Chelsea and that Chelsea lost 7-0. I also remember the goalkeeper had ginger hair. Did this really happen or had I eaten too many Sugar Puffs before bed?\" \"I have read somewhere that the singing of Abide With Me at the start of the FA Cup final was abandoned in the 1960s because fans drowned it out with whistling and obscenities,\" writes Sam Knight. \"The song in its current form was later introduced \u2013 a shorter version led by a performer over the public address system \u2013 although it isn't quite as epic/moving as it once was. Is this story (the drowning out/reintroduction) true? If so, do you have any idea why fans reacted to the song with so much derision?\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@guardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
