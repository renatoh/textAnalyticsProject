A first natural target is the risk managers in the commercial and investment banks. They sanctioned a range of unwise investments. Yet in many, perhaps most, cases their micro-level decisions followed due process. The problem was that the assumptions that underpinned their risk models were ceasing to hold - a classic illustration of the distinction between micro and macro analysis. Thus while some responsibility rests with the risk managers, that is not the full story. A second level of responsibility lies at the level of bank governance. A senior risk manager explained to me recently how he had been authorising property-based investments that, taken one by one, were good individual risks. But had he known his bank's total exposure, he would never have sanctioned these investments, at least in their totality. Clearly there is more to fix in the domain of corporate governance: yet responsibility does not stop there either. A natural target is the rating agencies, for failing to warn sufficiently of the risks that, in hindsight, have been seen so clearly. And they too are obviously part of the story. However, to hold them responsible for these capital losses is like blaming shopkeepers for inflation: while they bear some of the responsibility, they are scarcely the originating cause. Similarly with the regulators. Their shortcomings have become evident but it is clear that they were scrambling to understand a range of complex new exotic products whose properties had not been established, at least in times of stress. Perhaps the regulators should have disallowed them: but then only a few years ago people were uttering dire warnings about new derivative products and the phenomenal rise of the hedge fund industry. And, as Charlie McCreevy, the EU Commissioner for Internal Markets, has pointed out, these have stood up interestingly well, so far at least. Perhaps, therefore, it is the inventors of the exotic new financial products who should be blamed? Maybe. But they were responding to widespread investor desire for higher rates of return than, in a world of record-low bond yields and official interest rates, were obtainable from conventional instruments. Or maybe the real blame lies with the portfolio managers and their like who bought these products? After all, they are paid to assess risk relative to return. If they did not understand what they were buying, arguably they should not have bought. But theirs is a competitive industry: any investment manager who does not provide the full menu of products and returns stands to lose business - particularly now that investors are inundated with information about where to find the highest rates of interest, and investor capital is mobile at the squeak of a mouse. Perhaps, therefore, the real culprits were the central bankers? Arguably, they took interest rates too low, and held them there too long, following the dotcom collapse in 2000, and then 9/11, thereby fuelling excessive growth of liquidity. In other words, was the culprit Mr Greenspan's Fed? After all, it led the global rate-cutting cycle, and went the furthest. Moreover, it was the US that experienced the greatest housing boom, the greatest subsequent wealth losses, and is now seeing a construction industry slump that could last for years. Up to a point, Lord Copper. But remember that, in 2000, policymakers worldwide were preoccupied by the prospect of the US, and perhaps others, following Japan into deflation. Central bankers were not at all sure how, or even whether, they would be able to deal with that: it had already taken Japan 10 years to get out of deflation, and it was not certain that it truly had. Nevertheless, it could be argued that everything is the fault of the US, if only because its consumers have, depending on the year, saved little, nothing, or even less than nothing (by living on credit) at the same time as its government chose to prosecute a war while cutting taxes. All this has contributed to booming US imports and a current account deficit that has weakened the dollar, threatening the exports, and hence GDPs, of other economies. Again, maybe. But possibly, the top layer of blame belongs to the 1945 architects of today's international monetary system. At Bretton Woods, Britain's Lord Keynes argued for a world institution with authority to oblige both debtors and creditors - that is, in today's case, both the US and China - to change their policies. But the US, through Assistant Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White, gave that plan short shrift. What emerged was little more than a fixed pool of national currencies and gold, administered by an IMF that was charged only with managing nations' trade deficits. So, over half a century later, has the real culprit been identified - a US Treasury Secretary who is, conveniently, long dead? Probably not. The key point to recognise is that the world is a complicated place. There is seldom, if ever, a single cause of anything, and certainly not in the world of economics and finance. What is vital now is to learn all the lessons from what has happened, and continues to happen. There will have to be reform at a great many levels, from the most micro to the most macro. And then it has to be hoped that, when all the new pieces have finally been fitted together, and the world economic engine starts to rev up again, all its new bits function well together, without the machine flying apart. \u00b7 John Llewellyn is Senior Economic Policy Advisor at Lehman Brothers"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
