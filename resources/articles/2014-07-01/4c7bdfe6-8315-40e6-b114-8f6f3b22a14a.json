While the 34-year-old later tweeted to say that \u201cafter watching the race back think I overreacted with my feelings about Lewis\u2019s move. I can understand why he thought I was giving him room,\u201d he was clearly annoyed immediately after Hamilton had moved up the inside of him on lap 30 at the Turn Six hairpin. The Mercedes driver was coming from behind and, as he attempted to go through, he took a glancing blow from Button\u2019s car that damaged his front-left end-plate, resulting in a lack of downforce that would cost him second place. He passed Button a lap later with ease using the drag reduction system but by then the damage had been done. Immediately after the race Hamilton had said he believed it had been an innocent racing incident and that he had made a poor call. \u201cI honestly thought he was opening the door to let me past,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a bit like that in the past race, for example, so my bad on judgment there.\u201d But with further reflection he was less sympathetic to Button\u2019s positioning through the turn. \u201cWith Jenson I was really surprised because he has been a real gentleman and really respectful and he has been great in previous races.\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m much quicker, so rather than waste time battling with me, he can see me coming and he gives me space and doesn\u2019t close the door. \u201cAt the time I was battling [Daniel] Ricciardo, so I was quite far behind and I knew I was not close enough to dart up the inside and then he started going wide, so I thought: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s opened the door for me to let me go.\u2019 But then he started turning and coming back through and I really thought it was over for me then.\u201d Hamilton escaped with only minor damage and made it to third at the finish but Button, who moved up from 11th on the grid to finish eighth, expressed puzzlement as to why Hamilton would expect anyone to simply move aside. \u201cWhy would we let anyone through?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of drivers do that line to get a good exit from the corner,\u201d referring to a wider entry that gives a better exit on to the short straight into Turn Seven. \u201cI think the problem with Lewis is he expected me to let him past,\u201d Button added. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person he drove into today. It\u2019s strange, when the car\u2019s so much quicker, you\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t get into so [many] fights, but there you go. He drove into my rear wheel.\u201d Button, struggling with an uncompetitive McLaren this season, is used to the cut and thrust of racing in the midfield and clearly did not feel the need to make exceptions for his former team-mate. \u201cI\u2019m out there doing my race\u201d he said. \u201cIt would make it boring if we all let him past when he was coming through the field.\u201d The Mercedes head of motor sport, Toto Wolff, preferred to refer to it as a misunderstanding but pointed out that it caused damage that was crucial to Hamilton\u2019s race. \u201cThe misunderstanding with Jenson cost him quite some lap time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re quite down on downforce on the front wing. The car would have had much more performance with the wing not being an issue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
