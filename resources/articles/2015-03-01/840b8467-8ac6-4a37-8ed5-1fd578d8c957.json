I caught three of these sessions, held in Austin convention centre, which had varying degrees of insight. The least insightful \u2013 but the most entertaining \u2013 came from Friday\u2019s keynote speaker Snoop Dogg. The rap legend didn\u2019t really give a speech but was interviewed on stage by his manager Ted Chung. For this reason, a hard-hitting interrogation was not on the cards, but the Dogg still managed to entertain. Dressed for business is gold-rimmed specs, a posh white shirt and bow-tie, Snoop offered his thoughts on how he\u2019s managed to stay popular and relevant. He said it\u2019s all down to studying the music business and always paying attention to new artists, who in turn show him respect: \u2018I\u2019m Uncle Snoop\u2019, he said, to guffaws from the crowd. Snoop said that he remembered an older generation of artists, like Dionne Warwick, heavily criticising him when he was a young gangsta rapper: \u201ceveryone was on Snoop Dogg like I\u2019m the worst black man ever created,\u201d he said. He said it \u201crubbed him the wrong way\u201d, and so \u201cI try not to rub young homies the wrong way.\u201d It\u2019s not difficult to see why other musicians want to collaborate with him \u2013 while his records have occasionally wavered in quality, he is still demonstrably cool, with a voice you could listen to all day, whether rapping or in conversation. Snoop also seems remarkably mellow after over two torrid decades in the music industry, though this could be due to the fact that he says the first thing he thinks about in the morning is smoking weed. He is involved in a range of activities from painting to his Youth Football League, which puts inner city children on the road to college, including his son, Cordell Broadus, who is going to UCLA - the first person in Snoop\u2019s family to go to college. Very sweetly, Snoop said that seeing Cordell pick his school was the happiest day of his life. The funny moments came when Snoop discussed his friendship and collaborative partnership with Willie Nelson, based on a shared love of \u201canimals, good music and grass\u201d. Snoop painted a vivid picture of the pair playing dominos while stoned in Amsterdam - \u201che was whoopin\u2019 my ass\u201d. Weed also inspired another of his unlikely pursuits \u2013 abstract painting. He was in \u201cthe Versace hotel in Australia\u201d when he started to make the painting, which was inadvertently finished off with some ash from Snoop\u2019s spliff. It now hangs on the hotel wall. Snoop has a natural flair for social media, and it was no surprise to hear him praise it. The rapper professes himself \u201cfor the people\u201d, and social media allows him to put his money where his mouth is. He loves having a close relationship with his fans, and hearing the words, \u201cSnoop! Give me a selfie!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a love thing,\u201d the rapper smiled. (Incidentally, at Art Basel in December the MoMA curator Klaus Biesenbach recommended Snoop\u2019s Instagram account as one of his favourites.) There was less love but probably more insight in a panel about \u201cthe celebrity economy in music\u201d on Thursday which featured the Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman and Will and Win Butler from Arcade Fire, along with Berger Management\u2019s Nicky Berger and Nielsen\u2019s Tatiana Simonian. Krugman said that in revenue terms, things have changed for artists less than you might think \u2013 touring was always around seven times more lucrative than selling records. There was a discussion about sponsorship and whether bands should accept it, with Simonian saying that she used to be against it but \u201cstreet credibility didn\u2019t pay my bills ... the dialogue has changed.\u201d She said that Chipotle were sponsoring new bands, and that as a young performer \u201cI would have been stoked to get free burritos.\u201d This cut no ice with Win Butler, who immediately said \u201cIt\u2019s selling out. You can afford to get a Chipotle burrito if you\u2019re running your tour right.\u201d This moment of truth was followed up by Krugman memorably describing the New York Times as \u201can advertising platform for luxury goods wrapped in a little bit of news\u201d. Increasingly, brands will want to involve themselves with bands, though less overtly than in times gone by. Berger approvingly said that the American salad bar chain Sweet Green has a festival called Sweet Life \u2013 though this got a snort from Win Butler. \u201cArtists are always screwed over, only now it\u2019s different people,\u201d he said. They are, he said \u201calways giving more value than you\u2019re getting.\u201d So with revenues from record sales declining, how will bands be able to afford to play in 10 years? Will Butler pointed out something that has become increasingly apparent \u2013 that more and more, it\u2019s bands\u2019 parents who pay for them to make music. \u201cAs the rich get richer their kids can do whatever the hell they want.\u201d This analysis was backed up by Krugman, who added that the share of cash going to a few bands at the top \u2013 presumably the likes of Madonna and the Rolling Stones \u2013 has increased, meaning that everyone else gets a shrinking size of the pie. The only real cheer was provided by Will Butler, who pointed out that the internet has facilitated \u201ca golden age of folk art \u2013 all these stupid internet jokes. In terms of creativity we\u2019re in a really good place, but music is less of a golden age.\u201d Something definitely not having a golden age is the music press. Friday saw a panel called \u201cShould music mags survive or get killed off?\u201d It included US music press royalty including Ann Powers, Jim DeRogatis and Jaan Uhelszki, but I didn\u2019t feel as though the question was really answered \u2013 not that music magazines are going to be saved by a panel of hacks arguing about whether or not old copies of Creem had been preserved on microfilm, as these did for what seemed like an eternity. One of few bright spots in an hour of nostalgic bellyaching was provided by Powers, who pointed out that the internet has enabled a whole crop of talented women to write about music, who would have been marginalised in the boys\u2019 club of the music press. DeRogatis complained: \u201cbut they don\u2019t know where the comma goes,\u201d his point being that writers need editors, lawyers and the rest of the infrastructure a magazine can bring. No-one made the obvious point, that while there is a plethora of music journalism, and it\u2019s often brilliant, it\u2019s usually now found outside music magazines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
