The founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, are the most obvious representatives of this second phase of the internet revolution. When the company floats later this year, valued at up to \u00a31.5bn, the two former Stanford college students will become millionaires overnight. The period after flotation will be crucial for the search giant, as observers watch keenly to see whether it can simultaneously maintain its prospectus pledge not to \"be evil\" and deal with heightened search competition from Yahoo!, Microsoft and others. The other major phenomenon over the last year has been the rise of legal downloading as the music industry at last removed its head from the sand and began to embrace the web. The role of Apple's Steve Jobs cannot be overplayed as he finally persuaded the majors to subscribe to a cheap, easy to use legal download service in the form of iTunes. Ashley Highfield, the BBC's director of new media, has endured a year of highs and lows. While having to rein in his more expansionist tendencies in the wake of Philip Graf's government commissioned report into BBC Online, he has also overseen the development of the Creative Archive and the interactive Media Player, two technologies that could prove the most revolutionary yet in the BBC's online journey. At BT, Ben Verwaayen has seen his bold gamble on broadband begin to pay off. Most observers expect the company to hit its target of 5 million subscribers over its lines by the end of next year and improvements to the technology, together with wider coverage, should make services such as video on demand a reality sooner rather than later. Bill Gates remains one of the most powerful men on the planet but to some extent his company is still searching for a role in the internet age. With convergence finally on the horizon, a fact that the company has acknowledged by aggressively touting its Media Center software, the next year will be Microsoft's best chance of establishing itself at the centre of the so-called \"home hub\". Yahoo!, eBay and Amazon remain the holy trinity of dotcom era shooting stars that made the leap to established, profit-making behemoths. Yahoo! has shifted its focus to search and paid-for services and is reaping the rewards, while eBay remains the most popular site in the world by some distance, with the phenomonen latterly picked up by the mainstream media. At Amazon, Jeff Bezos' pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap policy has been handsomely rewarded with record international growth. Wanadoo's UK chief, Eric Abensur, oversaw the rebranding of Freeserve and along with his contemporaries campaigned ceaselessly to persuade Ofcom to force BT to slash its prices for access to the \"local loop\". He will face a growing challenge from AOL, BT and countless others in the coming year to take advantage by moving more former Freeserve customers to broadband while maintaining its position as the UK's most popular ISP. And sneaking in at number 10, anonymous call girl blogger Belle de Jour, who sparked a ludicrous media guessing game over her identity that led to a book deal for the author, makes the list as a representative of the millions of online bloggers and the year that blogging went overground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
