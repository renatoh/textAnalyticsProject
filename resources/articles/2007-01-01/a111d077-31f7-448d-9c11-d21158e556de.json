Few observers of Denise Kingsmill would be surprised by such advice from the former deputy chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, ennobled as a Labour peer in last year's controversial honours list. Five years ago, the former lawyer led a government inquiry into women's employment, followed a few years later with another into how business treated its workforce. Underpinning both was the idea that failing to promote and appreciate women made poor business sense. Yet there are some in the clubby, stuffy world of the House of Lords who might raise an eyebrow at what could be seen as a rookie peer's bid for power. Kingsmill will certainly not admit to such machiavellianism after six months in the house. \"It would simply be good for diversity,\" she says. Kingsmill, who was born in New Zealand and brought up in industrial south Wales, is an unlikely but fabulous guide to the Lords. Waiting for her on hard red leather seats under the vaulted stone arches of the peers' entrance, I had watched lots of grey-haired men walk past, including a much diminished Lord Tebbit. Then, Kingsmill appears. Tall at almost 6ft and slim in a black trouser suit, she is impossibly glamorous with her blonde hair and enormous bead necklace. When I first met Kingsmill many years ago she was delving into the complex issue of share underwriting, yet even then her warmth and charm defied the subject matter. Walking through the hallowed corridors proudly displaying her pass - which later gets caught up in the beads - she spots one of the many loitering security men. \"Let's look as if we know what we're doing,\" she half whispers. A great networker, she takes pains to introduce me to associates and appears still to be pinching herself to be in the highest chamber in the land. Yet her arrival in the Lords was not without controversy. She was among the Labour peers on \"that list\", the one that has subsequently been consumed by the cash-for-honours scandal. While her financial contribution has never warranted comment, she has still been subject to the sort of muted whispering campaign that suggested her appearance in a party commercial in 1992 had more to do with her elevation than her work. Asked about the controversy, which at the least delayed her arrival in the house, she says: \"I feel saddened by it and continue to feel quite sad that people like Sir Gulam Noon who would have made excellent peers are not here.\" Undercurrent There are still some snipers. When asked about her chances of working for the chancellor, one high-flying mandarin sniffed that she seemed \"overexposed and underwhelming\". Kingsmill, who has made a career out of joining difficult clubs such as the law as well as the Lords, has keen antennae for what she calls the \"sort of undercurrent\" of gossip that attends even seemingly trivial performances in the House. She is keen to work hard and thrive: \"I don't want to conform but I do want to achieve things, which you do by being part of things really.\" Top of the list of things she wants to achieve in the House is the somewhat vague but laudable ambition to \"bring together business and politics\". She is to take her first step towards doing that next week when she is scheduled to open her maiden debate in the Lords on the issue of British competitiveness. \"I really feel that the House of Lords ought to be talking about business issues. I want to try and formulate a debate that the Labour party should have about policies that create wealth in order to use that wealth for social justice purposes.\" She has a lawyer's reticence for talking about her casework but her career over the past 20 years has involved advising some high-powered and successful business figures such as Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line, as well as working on some difficult boards such as MFI and Telewest. One newspaper dredged up a long-ago personal injury case in which she was criticised by the court of appeal for the level of payout she and a legal partner had recommended that a victim accept. She defends this as a \"professional judgment\" which she would take again. At the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, to which she was appointed in the dying days of the last Tory administration, she worked on 22 inquiries from milk supply to the proposed merger of Lloyds TSB and Abbey National. After leaving in 2003 she moved on to advise several FTSE 100 companies and is a non-executive director at British Airways as well as senior executive adviser to the Royal Bank of Scotland. She is on BA's nominations committee and is a drum banger for diversity. \"I always say companies should have more women on the leadership team. I can't let it go. \"UK plc is wasting so much talent. Women come out of school and university with a better education and yet we are not enabling them to make their full contribution to the economy. It is ludicrous that we have so few women in the FTSE. I'm a logical person and the logic seems mind-numbingly obvious.\" A long-standing Labour party member - she joined at 18 - she still believes that closer links and understanding of business is important in order to avoid the sort of anti-corporatism that exists in America in the post-Worldcom and Enron era. \"It is important, particularly if Gordon Brown is prime minister, that we start getting that conjoining of business and government,\" she says. She is not without political answers. When I ask why Brown's elevation will make any difference she talks about his role in raising the profile of competition in the UK. \"When I was first appointed [to the MMC] it was a grey institution. People didn't really know what it did. It was full of grey academics. But that changed, very much under Gordon's aegis.\" She has been credited with increasing the public profile of the competition authority, largely by championing public meetings on individual cases or by being more press friendly than her peers. Culture shock As we chat over toasted teacakes in the Lords, she stops to praise Lord Leitch on his report into the skills shortage last month. Education and training are among Kingsmill's core interests. She calls going up to Cambridge from her Welsh grammar school \"a real jumping off point\" in her life. Already experienced at culture shock - having arrived in Wales eight years earlier with a Kiwi accent - the shock of arriving in the Fens was still great. \"I was brought up in industrial south Wales. I hadn't met a Tory until I went to Cambridge!\" She is partly driven by an \"immigrant's desire to pay something back\". \"I went up to Cambridge free, gratis, for nothing.\" I can't help pointing out that she would not be able to do so today and the politician in her cannot help retorting: \"I know. But there are so many more who do it.\" After university, she started on a marketing career with ICI Fibres and is still proud of her work on the chemical group's crease-resistant material Crimplene. She has said that she became a lawyer in order to save the world after a stint in New York in the late 1970s. She took her last bar exam the day her son was due to be born and was 31 when she qualified. The fact that she was much older than average \"didn't matter after a few years\", she said. \"I always told my children: It doesn't matter what you do up to the age of 30. After that, it matters.\" When I first asked to interview Kingsmill at the beginning of last year, she put me off by saying that she had her daughter's marriage to arrange. She did not tell me at the time that the two women shopped for wedding dresses together as last summer also saw her second marriage - to Richard Wheatley, the man who turned around Jazz FM. \"I never used to mention my children when they were small because I would worry that people would question my commitment,\" she admits now. When asked if she has any regrets, she gives a somewhat surprising answer. \"I wish I hadn't worked so hard. I don't have any hobbies. I work and I go home and spend time with my family. I love fly fishing and I've been once this year.\" It seems unlikely that her maiden year in the Lords will see her fishing much more. During the course of the past year she has been tipped for a bewildering array of top jobs from head of the CBI to the chairman of ITV. She says she is interested in \"project work\" but is keener to make her mark on the Lords. \"There are some people who simply fade into the wallpaper. And maybe that's what I'll end up doing.\" When I raise an eyebrow, she says: \"Well, you don't want to stand out too much.\" And at that, we both laugh.
