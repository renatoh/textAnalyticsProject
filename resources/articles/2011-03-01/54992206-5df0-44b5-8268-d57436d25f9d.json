England would have been based in the city and had been scheduled to face Argentina and Georgia at the damaged AMI Stadium, as well as a potential quarter-final. Christchurch's two knockout games have already been moved to Auckland and it is understood the Pumas' game on Sunday 10 September will follow suit. England are already due to face Scotland at Eden Park in their final pool fixture. Martin Johnson, England's team manager, expressed a sense of regret but also felt \"the right decision\" had been made. \"We feel for the people of Christchurch who are still suffering following the tragic earthquake. We know how keen they were to play a role in the World Cup and we were looking forward to being based there. But we accept this is the right decision for the tournament and for New Zealand based on all the expert advice. \"We are working closely with Rugby World Cup Limited to understand the possible options for our pool games and what that means for us in terms of a training base but understand the complexities involved so we are comfortable with a short delay while it is all being worked out. Once we are clear on the location of our pool games we will send someone out to recce the new training and match venues and accommodation. For now we are just focused on this weekend's game in Dublin.\" Australia were also due to have been based in Christchurch and their games against Italy and Russia will have to be relocated. New Zealand's Rugby World Cup minister Murray McCully said he hoped some of the five pool matches at present in limbo would remain in the South Island."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
