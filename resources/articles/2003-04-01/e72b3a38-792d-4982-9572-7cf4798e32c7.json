There have been reports of damaging divisions among Sven-Goran Eriksson's players, which people thought England were rid off after the departure of the Swede's predecessor Kevin Keegan. However, Butt said it did not pose a threat to unity. \"There's a lot mentioned about the United, Liverpool and Arsenal thing and it's true that when we go away with England we all have our cliques. I'd be lying if I said we didn't. I want to spend my time with friends and they just happen to be the United lads.\" Butt was speaking as a player who has grown up with his fellow internationals Gary Neville and David Beckham. Rio Ferdinand is United's fourth representative in the squad. The Liverpool contingent of Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen and Danny Murphy also stick together, and Butt says it is the same for Arsenal's players. \"It's the same in any walk of life. Just because you work at the same place, you will always have your close friends,\" he said. \"But I will still go to sit with players from Liverpool or Arsenal, have a chat or something to eat, no problem at all.\" Eriksson, meanwhile, has allies in his belief that it is not in Wayne Rooney's interests to start games for England. Some already depict the 17-year-old striker as a challenger to Emile Heskey, but that notion was rejected yesterday by Owen and Sol Campbell. \"Rooney has got two caps now and not even played 90 minutes,\" said Owen. \"He's not been around for long and it's unfair to compare [him with Heskey]. Wayne could be an unbelievable player. He could be an England regular for the next decade, but no one knows yet. \"When I was coming through at Liverpool I don't think I was playing in every single game. I was rested here and there. David Moyes [the manager] at Everton looks to be doing the same. I think it's only right that England should do that as well. \"Wayne probably wants to play in every game for Everton. I've no doubt that he is good enough, but you've got to manage players as well when they're that age.\" There is an irony in Owen urging restraint, considering his own impact as a 18-year-old in the 1998 World Cup, but the Liverpool forward had by then amassed more experience. There is no question, though, that Rooney has the brawn. \"He's more developed physically than I was. In fact I'm still not as developed physically as him,\" Owen joked. Campbell is adamant that Rooney is too valuable to be rushed. \"You can't keep on thrusting a young lad in all the time,\" he said. \"When someone like him comes along, don't destroy him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
