Mine just grew ... 34GG and after two children they headed due south. Bras and swimwear were reinforced: I know why Pamela Anderson went for a reduction - there's only so much a cossie can do. So after a lot of research I went to the top - Addie Grobbelaar, member of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons and clinical director of research at the Reconstructive Plastic and Burns Surgery at Mount Vernon, plus he has a private practice in Harley Street (you'd be surprised how many people are out there who don't have the right qualifications). We settled for a CC cup (you can't do anything about the base width of your breasts), and the night before I went in I weighed them on the kitchen scales - 14lbs! I stayed one night in hospital and now I'm 32CC (don't ask me why my back got smaller, it just did). The scars faded fast and there was absolutely no pain. It's brilliant. \u00b7 Contact A Grobbelaar, 30 Harley Street, London W1, 020 7580 5774. Cost: from \u00a34,000"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
