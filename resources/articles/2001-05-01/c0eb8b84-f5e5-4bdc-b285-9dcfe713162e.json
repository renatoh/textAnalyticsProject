In retirement, with his wife Irene, he became a significant benefactor of higher education and the visual arts. The youngest of five sons of one of London's largest and most successful shoe manufacturers, Kreitman was educated at Cordwainers College, east London, the training ground for the footwear industry. In 1938, aged 24, he joined the Territorial army, and then served throughout the second world war in the Royal Artillery. In 1945, after hostilities ceased, Kreitman suffered a minor riding accident while staying at the Selsdon Park Hotel, Surrey. He was tended by a sympathetic Irene Cohen, who was also staying there with her parents. Irene was the elder daughter of John (later Sir John) Cohen, the founder of the Tesco chain. His biographer, Maurice Corina, has described Kreitman at this time as \"a large, pipe-smoking, enigmatic man - creative and cultured, courteous and calm\", and later that year Kreitman and Irene were married. A great and lasting love was born, exemplified in the devotion with which she cared for her husband through his prolonged final illness. Kreitman briefly rejoined his family firm, but the following year Jack Cohen invited him to join Tesco. He rapidly became joint managing director and, as Cohen's right-hand man, played a key role in the development of the company during the next 25 years. It was a partnership in which Kreitman provided the shrewd judgment and essential administrative leadership that enabled Tesco to grow rapidly, and with great commercial and financial success. He became its managing director in 1968 and its chairman in 1970. Jack Cohen was elevated to the position of life president of the company but, reluctant to give up the day-to-day running of the company, increasingly clashed with Kreitman in the latter's efforts to run Tesco in a modern and dynamic way. Eventually, in 1974, after a series of boardroom disagreements, Kreitman found his position intolerable and, then aged 60, decided to leave. In retirement, he created a charitable foundation supporting higher education and the arts, and devoted his life to this work. From the beginning of their marriage, Irene and Hyman had collected art for their own pleasure, but his particular interest in sculpture led the couple to an early appreciation of the British school of sculpture, headed by Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, that emerged in the aftermath of the war. In the Kreitmans' home were examples of the work of both artists, together with pieces by Kenneth Armitage, Michael Ayrton, Lynn Chadwick, Elizabeth Frink and, following through to the next generation,Anthony Caro. Kreitman himself also made sculpture, both imaginative subjects and occasionally portraits. When he took sculpture lessons at a local art school, his highly practical bent found him teaching other students how to make armatures that would not collapse. His interest in art led to a friendship with Norman (later Sir Norman) Reid, the director of the Tate from 1964 to 1979; the warm relationship with the gallery was strengthened when Irene became a member of the Tate guides in 1976. Over the years, and especially in the 1990s, the Kreitman Foundation made a series of extraordinarily generous gifts to the Tate. The Kreitmans were characteristically modest and discriminating in their selection of projects that would enjoy their support. They chose activities that were essential to the long-term future of the Tate but which others might regard as not sufficiently visible. Their joint love of painting and sculpture resulted in gifts that made possible the acquisition of Night Movements, a magnificent late sculpture by Anthony Caro, and Mondrian's prophetic early work Church At Zoutelande. In the same spirit, they made a very early contribution to the development of Tate Modern, on London's South Bank, and funded, in full, the creation of the new Tate library and archive reading rooms, which are due to open in June next year at Tate Britain. This was a project that reflected Hyman's commitment to learning, and his and Irene's recognition that imaginative scholarship lies at the heart of every successful museum. In the 1970s, Kreitman gave crucial support to Israel's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, which made him an honorary doctor of philosophy in 1979. This was appropriate recognition of a man whose quiet charm, thoughtful analysis of any problem, consideration of other points of view and willingness to be decisive made him a successful man of business who might have been a great scholar in another life. He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. \u0095 Hyman Kreitman, businessman and patron, born June 3 1914; died May 8 2001"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
