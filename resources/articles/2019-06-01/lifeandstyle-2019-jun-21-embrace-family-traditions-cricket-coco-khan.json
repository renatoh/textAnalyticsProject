For years I associated it with tortuous summers in which male relatives commandeered the front room for days on end so they could watch, what, exactly? Eight hours of competitive waiting around? I\u2019d find myself in the garden as the shouts of \u201cHowzat!\u201d erupted. They came from the living room but perhaps, I imagined, the universe itself \u2013 a means to gauge my declining will to live. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d asked the cosmos. \u201cRubbish!\u201d I\u2019d think. When I was growing up, all the Asian kids in my neighbourhood had cricket in their lives. It was part of the furniture. But as I got older, I learned more about the sport\u2019s history, its colonial links, Norman Tebbit\u2019s cricket test \u2013 and cricket started to feel altogether hostile. But this year, England is hosting the Cricket World Cup on my doorstep. I bought a ticket, hoping to embrace my family\u2019s traditions. I can only describe the whole thing as a very English experience. It chucked it down in the morning, postponing play. Attendees were told a shorter match could occur if the weather cleared up, and so began the wait. Eventually the sun appeared: umbrellas came down, fans banged drums and danced tipsily, umpires filled the field as players milled around. Finally the announcement came over the PA: \u201cThis match has been abandoned.\u201d Five hours of talking about the weather, and then we all went home. Still, watching an empty piece of grass for several hours gives you time to think. And I felt that I finally understood the appeal. It\u2019s the pleasure of slowness, of sitting still and enjoying one thing at a time \u2013 the heat of the sun, the sound of leather on willow, the joy of a book when play is paused; and the absurd bemusement at how the English invented a sport you still can\u2019t play in the rain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
