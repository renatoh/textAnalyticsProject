Giuliana Sgrena, 57, a reporter for the communist Il Manifesto, was said to be injured in the shoulder and was in hospital. The Il Manifesto editor, Francesco Paterno, told Reuters: \"She was going in a car to the airport with three people from the Italian security forces. US forces opened fire on the car. She is fine but there are wounded.\" Italy greeted the news of her release with relief and joy. Masked gunmen had snatched her near Baghdad's university in broad daylight on February 4 after she had been interviewing Arab Sunnis hostile to the US-led occupation. In a video released two weeks ago she was seen breaking down and weeping as she begged for her life and for foreign troops to leave the country. \"No one should come to Iraq any longer because all foreigners, all Italians are considered enemies,\" she said. At least three Italian journalists who had remained in Baghdad left soon after the video, citing specific threats. It was not known if this contributed to her release."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
