The decision to offer a three-and-a-half-year contract, albeit heavily incentivised, worth somewhere in the region of \u00a370,000 a week to a 32-year-old has been widely queried but Sunderland\u2019s manager is certain the investment will pay dividends. \u201cWe think Jermain deserves the length of contract,\u201d said the Uruguayan, who hopes to give Defoe a debut, either from the start or off the bench, at his former club Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re convinced it\u2019s the right decision. It was a perfect deal really. Perfect deals don\u2019t happen very often. They\u2019re practically impossible.\u201d Poyet was full of praise for Lee Congerton, the club\u2019s sporting director, for pulling off a complex deal which took around three weeks to construct. Moreover he is adamant Defoe\u2019s presence means that, as manager, he must now shoulder increased responsibility. \u201cI am telling you there are no excuses now,\u201d he said. \u201cI am responsible, so whatever happens from this point onwards is down to me. I cannot say one thing one day and then change when it suits me. I don\u2019t like excuses but I know every now and then something comes out of me and can sound like excuses. Now I hope there are no more. We were missing something in front of goal but now we\u2019ve got Jermain.\u201d After winning only three Premier League games all season Sunderland are perched on the brink of the relegation zone with their manager heavily criticised for some negative tactics. In return for spending heavily on Defoe\u2019s contract the club\u2019s board are evidently hoping to see a more attractive and adventurous team rebuilt round the newcomer. \u201cWe need to adapt to Jermain and we\u2019ll try to change,\u201d said Poyet, who believes a striker he both played with and coached at Spurs could be back in the England squad by the summer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to develop something different. In the past we found it easier to be organised with one striker up front and the other working hard out wide.. Now it\u2019s a big possibility we\u2019ll start playing with two up front. There are plenty of things we could do differently. It could be a typical English 4-4-2, it could be a diamond or it could be five at the back, like Liverpool had with [Luis] Su\u00e1rez and [Daniel] Sturridge up front.\u201dSunderland\u2019s manager did not discount the possibility of Sturridge and Defoe appearing in future England teams together. \u201cIf Jermain plays and he\u2019s fit and he scores goals, I\u2019m sure the manager of the national team is going to try to get him,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, he wants to get back into the Barclays Premier League, prove that he can keep scoring goals, help us and then it\u2019s up to Mr Roy Hodgson. But that\u2019s the second step. The first one is to get back into business.\u201d Defoe cannot wait to get started. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cSunderland\u2019s a great club and I\u2019ve always enjoyed coming up here because of the stadium and the fans. It\u2019s a great place to play football. \u201cIt was good over in Toronto, I enjoyed it. But for me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and when you step away from it, you realise how good it is. To be honest, I just missed it. I wanted to come back and be back in the Premier League scoring goals.\u201d He is not entirely surprised to be making his debt at White Hart Lane. \u201cThat\u2019s always how it happens isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s going to be tough. I\u2019d been at Tottenham for 10 years, it\u2019s a good club \u2013 but if we create chances and, hopefully take them I believe we can win the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
