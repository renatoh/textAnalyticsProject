It was Shahzad, not Adil Rashid, who was the first British-born Asian to play cricket for Yorkshire, a significant moment for a club that had persistently been accused of being less than all inclusive. It passed relatively unnoticed and it was Rashid, whose leg-spin had an excitement about it, who came to symbolise the cultural changes that were afoot in the county of the White Rose. Six years on, at 24, Shahzad's career remains insignificant \u2013 22 first-class matches and 15 one-day games, hardly the sort of statistics to make an England selector's heart race. But he can now dream of a Test debut in Bangladesh after impressing with England's performance squad in South Africa before Christmas, not just for his blossoming ability to swing the ball at pace, but because he was brimful of confidence and desire to learn. An England call-up was the last thing he expected. He was hurt to be omitted from the Lions squad heading to the Emirates and rang Sajid Mahmood, his fast-bowling mate from over the Pennines, who suggested that he might be in the Test squad. Shahzad laughed and said, \"No, I don't know about that.\" Then, as his worries deepened, he was told by David Parsons, the ECB performance director, to expect a call from Geoff Miller, the chairman of selectors. \"I thought that name rings a bell,\" he said. Cricket in Asia is as unknown a quantity for Shahzad as any Yorkshire lad. He was born in Huddersfield to a Bradford-born mother, Parveen, and a Pakistan-born father. He has visited Pakistan twice, the last time when seven years old, and he has vague memories of playing tapeball in the streets. Now he cannot wait to revisit. It is easy to see why England have taken a punt on him. He has an indefatigable confidence, a stark contrast to Rashid, who is a demure soul, and his approach to diet and fitness is more enlightened than another British Asian who has fallen by the wayside, Samit Patel, the rounder Nottinghamshire all-rounder, pointedly ignored by England until he gets in shape. \"Me and Rashid are from different backgrounds,\" Shahzad conceded. \"I was at private school. I have had to learn to fit in and I've always had the confidence. Being the first Asian wasn't a big thing. Adil has come from a traditional Asian background and he has found it harder to mingle. But his skill levels are so good that people will always want to talk to him. He is a young leg-spinning all-rounder and you don't get many of them.\" Shahzad makes light of his own little piece of history. \"It was a big thing for the Asian community when I was picked for Yorkshire. It opened avenues. But I was at Bradford grammar and then on a cricket scholarship at Woodhouse Grove, so I got noticed easily.\" But he was a deal more persistent than that. He was repeatedly overlooked at Yorkshire age-group level \u2014 he was overweight and, anyway, favouritism in junior selections is hardly unknown \u2014 but his father Mohammed, a staunch cricketer in the local leagues, repeatedly pressed Yorkshire for a trial. Shahzad eventually found himself in front of the county's bowling coach, Steve Oldham, a man hewn from traditional Yorkshire materials: honest, stubborn, a believer in time-proven values. As ever, Shahzad revels in the fun of the anecdote. \"The academy squad were having a net and they let me join in. I thought I am better than these guys. 'Esso' watched me for five minutes and said he would give me a full-time academy contract, but I'd have to give up my schooling. He cares more about education these days. \"He takes a bit of understanding, but he has been a massive help to me.\" Tough times followed. Soon after his debut against Worcestershire, Shahzad succumbed to a stress fracture of his back in a second XI match at Todmorden, and toyed with a degree in pharmacy instead. He credits a winter with a former Yorkshire captain, Darren Lehmann, at his academy in Adelaide, for helping him find maturity. \"Suddenly I enjoyed getting up at half past six to go for a run with the sun shining. Because I am from an Asian background, my mum makes a lot of fried food and curries and chapatis. I don't eat them any more. The penny dropped for me and I have cut them out of my diet for 18 months. I eat a lot of grilled food, although I still have to have a bit of spice in it. I have learnt what I need to put into my body. \"When you can see the results, you understand. In a year I went from 15 stones to 12 and a half stones. My body felt good, I felt lighter, just as strong, I could run further. I was a big lad as a kid as well. When Tim Bresnan got into the England side and I finally got a regular chance at Yorkshire, bowling long spells up the hill at Headingley, I knew I was fit enough to do it.\" Only now does he feel back to full pace again. He has been clocked at more than 90mph but like a former team-mate, Darren Gough, he is most comfortable around the high 80s. He has a little of Gough's chutzpah in the way his opinions and feelings pour forth, a feeling evident in South Africa when he had a fast-bowling coaching session with the former South African great Allan Donald. \"I said to AD, 'I am bubbly, aggressive and I'm in your face, and I want to be able to intimidate people. I know it's hard against the world's best but how do I do that? It was a privilege to learn, sit back and listen to what they have to say. If a Test comes round, then great. Maybe I won't play much but I've got a great chance to learn.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
