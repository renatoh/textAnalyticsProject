A little of the view of this year's Grand National is still obscured by mist \u2013 a few jockey bookings, for instance, and the exact cut-off point at the bottom of the handicap \u2013 but like the last of the great Alpine peaks to yield to the climbers, its bewitching appeal is matched only by the sense of lurking threat. And more so perhaps this year than for many seasons past, 12 months on from a race that provided the fifth 100-1 winner in National history. One piece of trivia that may well get plenty of air over the next few days is that the first 100-1 National winner \u2013 Tipperary Tim in 1928 \u2013 was followed 12 months later by the second, Gregalach. The pin-stickers should need no further encouragement. But while it is superficially tempting to lump Mon Mome's success last season into the \"freak result\" file, what was really interesting about his victory was that it was anything but. Tipperary Tim, for instance, was the only runner in a 42-strong field to complete without mishap, as was Foinavon in 1967. Gregalach emerged from the biggest field in National history, an extraordinary 66 runners. Mon Mome, on the other hand, was one of 17 finishers and while he certainly relished a trouble-free round over the big fences, having been badly hampered in the race in 2008, he did not show a huge leap in form either on the way to a 12-length success. Timeform, for instance, assessed it as only a 9lb improvement on his win at Cheltenham earlier in the season, which was impressive enough to see him start favourite for the Welsh National. Mon Mome also defied several of the more reliable recent trends in the race. French-breds had previously had a miserable record, while he was also only the second horse in 20 years to breach the 11st barrier. In fact, the first four horses home had 11st or more in the saddle and My Will, in third, was another French-bred. Even Cerium, in fifth, defied conventional wisdom, as most of us had dismissed him beforehand as just another joke contender for Fergus and Judith Wilson. So the lesson to take from the 2009 National may be that after 20 years of change to the structure of the course and, more significantly, the shape of the race itself, the Grand National is finally the \"anything can win\" event that the British public had always, rather mistakenly, assumed it to be. For form students, this is anything but good news. Until about 15 years ago, you could put a line through at least half the field without a second thought, but now it is necessary to consider every runner at length. But for the race as a spectacle it is a very positive change, and not just because a big-priced winner will feed extra millions into the Levy. Phil Smith, the handicapper, deserves plenty of the credit, as it seems ever more unlikely that a horse will start the National from outside the handicap proper. The overall quality of the race has also improved to such a degree that anything on a long downward spiral is unlikely to make the cut. Ultimately, though, it is hard to believe that the modern, ultra-competitive Grand National could have come to pass without the softening of the course that took place after the 1989 running, in which two horses died at Becher's. Roundly attacked by many traditionalists at the time, the adjustments made at Becher's and elsewhere can now be seen as necessary, even visionary. Racing's administrators are frequently \u2013 and justifiably \u2013 criticised for their conservatism and torpor, but the new National is one reminder that sometimes they do get the big decisions right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
