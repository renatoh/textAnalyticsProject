The series has been switched after West Indies ruled out a tour of Pakistan because of the escalation of tensions on the border with India. Only four Tests have been played at neutral venues: three between Australia and South Africa in a triangular tournament in England in 1912 and one between Pakistan and India in Bangladesh in 1998-99. \"We were considering Bangladesh, Tangiers [Morocco] and Sharjah among the neutral venues, but we opted for Sharjah because we can generate more revenues from television rights and sponsorships,\" said Tauqir Zia, the Pakistan board chairman. \"We will try to make the most of the situation, since we have gone without international cricket since September 11 and our team needs to play badly.\" New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India have all cancelled tours of Pakistan since September. India's one-day series in the West Indies starting in April has been reduced from seven to five matches to give the players a longer break at home before their Test tour of England starting in June. India will still play five Tests. Lancashire have moved to fill the gap left by the retirement of Michael Atherton by signing the Northamptonshire batsman Alec Swann, who was released by Northamptonshire after six years at the end of last season. \"Lancashire are one of the big clubs with lots of fine players and I'm delighted that they have offered me this opportunity,\" he said. Glamorgan have confirmed John Derrick as their new coach. Derrick, previously the assistant coach, had spells in charge of Glamorgan in 1996 and 1998 as well as representing the county and the Wales national team as a player. Worcestershire's Kadeer Ali scored 51 off 71 balls as England Under-19s made 178 for nine in 50 overs in a one-day match against Australia in Adelaide, but the hosts reached their target with nine overs and five wickets in hand. The International Cricket Council (ICC) will appoint an anti-corruption coordinator and five security managers in the battle against match-fixing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
