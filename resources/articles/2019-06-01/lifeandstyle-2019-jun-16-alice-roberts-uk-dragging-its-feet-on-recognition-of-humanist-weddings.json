Roberts, who is president of Humanists UK, called for the process of changing the law to be accelerated. \u201cMore and more people are turning to a humanist way of marking the milestone events of life: the birth of a child, celebrating a marriage and remembering a loved one,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government said a couple of years ago that it would make humanist weddings legal, but it has dragged its feet.\u201d In Scotland, where humanist celebrants have been permitted to conduct weddings since 2005, there are more humanist weddings than weddings in the Church of Scotland and the Catholic church combined, she added. \u201cThe government needs to make this happen soon.\u201d In England and Wales, couples opting for a humanist ceremony have to undergo a separate legal wedding in a registry office. Nevertheless, Humanists UK \u2013 of which Roberts is president \u2013 recorded an almost fourfold increase in such ceremonies between 2004 and 2012, while Church of England weddings fell by 28% and Catholic weddings by 34% in the same period. Roberts is anchoring a new online course, Humanist Lives in which scientists, artists, politicians and campaigners explore humanist beliefs and values. \u201cHumanism is much more than an absence of faith. It\u2019s a positive belief in humanity and the power of rational inquiry; a framework for how to live your own life and create a better, fairer, more inclusive society,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIt would be helpful if humanism was more widely recognised. We are a largely non-religious society, with a very small number of people going to church every week \u2013 well under a million regular churchgoers in the C of E, fewer than members of the RSPB [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]. \u201cYet we still have an established church in a diverse multicultural society, with reserved places for Anglican bishops in the House of Lords, and the C of E extending its reach and influence into education. It would be better if religion was not tied up with the state.\u201d Roberts, a biological anthropologist and television presenter, grew up in a deeply religious family, but gave up going to church when she was 15. In recent months, she has been criticised for sending her children to a Church of England primary school, and her mother, a retired teacher, has publicly challenged her opposition to faith schools. \u201cLike so many parents, I had no choice about where my children went to school,\u201d she said. Her children did not get places at non-religious schools near her home, leaving no alternative to a faith school. \u201cWe want all local schools to be inclusive, community schools.\u201d She also wants BBC Radio 4\u2019s Thought for the Day to be opened up to humanists \u2013 and to be the first to present the item. \u201cYou can have a view on ethics and morals from a non-religious rational perspective. I get so frustrated when the religious and theological view of morals and ethics is privileged over non-religious perspectives. It\u2019s deeply anachronistic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
