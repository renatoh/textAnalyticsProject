The writer expressed his multitude of passions through his books on topics ranging from architecture to the history of Venice, and was well-known for his work in radio and television. Born John Julius Cooper to Conservative MP Duff Cooper and socialite Lady Diana Cooper, he had a cosmopolitan upbringing. Closely bonded with his mother, who he called his \u201cgreatest inspiration\u201d, he was taught French aged five. His father, who would read and recite to a young Norwich, inspired his career as a performer. His childhood was marked by stints abroad with his family, and, following his evacuation to the US during the war, he was sent to the University of Strasbourg before embarking on a degree in French and Russian at New College, Oxford. Norwich launched a successful career at the Foreign Office in 1952, and married his first wife Anne Clifford. The marriage ended in divorce in 1985. He quickly ascending the ranks and served in Belgrade and, subsequently, Beirut until 1960. His desire to explore took him to the Middle East during his periods of leave. But it was a two-week visit to Sicily during work leave, which ignited his curiosity and, later, his writing career. Intrigued by the meeting of the Byzantine, Norman and Muslim civilisations, he was spurred on to write a book about it, and left the Foreign Office in 1964 to publish his first book, Mount Athos, with Reresby Sitwell. He later wrote books on the history of the popes \u2013 of whom he met four \u2013 and the Byzantine empire, and produced 30 television documentaries as well as hosting BBC radio show My Word in the 1970s and 1980s. A love of Venice, sparked in his teenage years, saw him visit the north Italian city some 200 times, and it was there that he began his career as a broadcaster. Cooper inherited his title of Viscount Norwich following the death of his father in 1954. He was appointed by the Queen as Commander to the Royal Victorian Order in 1992 following his curation of the Sovereign exhibition at the V&amp;A museum, celebrating 40 years of her reign. He is survived by his second wife, Mollie Phillips, to whom he was married for nearly 30 years, his son Jason, and two daughters Artemis and Allegra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
