It came with a two-page nondisclosure agreement couched in doom-laden legalese. I was allowed to read the vast book over the weekend, but presumably I couldn't tell anyone anything about it until my review was published. I wasn't even sure whether taking it to a coffee shop and displaying the apocalyptically themed dust jacket would count as a breach of the threatening embargo. I played it safe. I removed the telltale jacket. Then, glancing around nervously, I wrapped it in a copy of Hello! In the book the celebrated specialist in the made-up discipline of symbology, Robert Langdon, is in Florence, birthplace of Italian poet Dante Alighieri. This is not mere coincidence. For a noted genius of biological research has concocted a dastardly plot, while helpfully scattering clues as to its nature in the form of allusions to Dante's vision of hell, Inferno. Langdon is joined by a blonde doctor with an astronomical IQ. But a shadowy multinational organisation is also interested in the biologist's enigmatic plan, and its sexy agents chase the elegant couple around tourist attractions in search of purloined artefacts. Periodically, Langdon instructively remembers the text of his Harvard lectures on Dante and prominent Inferno-themed paintings. Brown's prose style retains its much-loved originality (\"a powerfully built woman effortlessly unstraddled her BMW motorcycle\"), and the story is engineered with miraculous efficiency, a tasty cocktail of high culture and low thrills. The pages fly by. Only lunatics would begrudge the blockbusting bard's determination to popularise great Italian poetry. Our premier purveyor of art-history conspiracy theories backs his fictions with a promise of cultural authenticity. This one's preamble reads: \"FACT: All artwork, literature, science, and historical references in this novel are real.\" I hope that isn't completely true, or the bioterrorist villain's plot has already succeeded, and we are all slightly doomed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
