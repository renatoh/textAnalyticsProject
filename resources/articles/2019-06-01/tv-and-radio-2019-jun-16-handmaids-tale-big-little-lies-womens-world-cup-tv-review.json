Sheesh but it\u2019s good: Margaret Atwood\u2019s characters have taken on a life of their own way past the book, which is surely the bellwether of any decent dys- or utopia. The cultural monstrosities of Gilead are quietly and slowly getting their comeuppance. Yet not that quietly nor slowly in one sequence, which was the essence of this phenomenal opener: Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) burns her damned house down, starting with the marital bed, and surely thoughts of husband Fred, wet lips ever lurking beneath that tinder-dry beard, who has erred only in ordering his wife\u2019s finger to be amputated and for being a mammothly controlling pig\u2019s tojo of a man. With so much grim God-politics behind her, I\u2019m not convinced one wee arson attack is going to absolve Serena, but June (Elisabeth Moss) and she would now seem to have an understanding, if not yet \u2013 or ever \u2013 a bond. As ever, Moss excels with that delicious blend of hawkish anger and butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt, to which men seem so exceedingly susceptible: the scenes in which she gazes on the blackened smoulderings have that enigmatic hint of an awesome vengeance. The 1985 book was exceptional: this series, coming and thriving when American women, black and rich and poor and white, are being asked to swallow retro-puritanical outrages on a daily basis, could not have arrived in a more timely month. It takes Atwood\u2019s appalled anger and runs with it, with utter success. Big Little Lies also returned, and, while we may have half-forgotten dead abusive husband Perry in the intervening months, we are still able to revel in the sheer delights of Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern and the gang, lucked out among the gilded billions of Monterey and now with a huge little lie of their own, clutched to their toned chests under that impossible California sun, which bathes as it stupids. What might have only amounted to a (savagely superior) murder-psycho-soap has been transformed for the second series by the presence of Meryl Streep as dead guy\u2019s mother: passive-aggressive as nobody but a mother can be, especially a prim bitchy mom in pursuit of her beloved, if rapist, son\u2019s killer or killers. I suspect Meryl might wear down the walls between them, given that those social walls are essentially formed of Kleenex and spit. Triple-ply and truffle-infused, but still paper and spit. Wonderfully watchable. Wild Bill was a thoroughly confusing mongrel, chasing its own tail rather wildly. That\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t, in some tail-chasing spots, a treat. But there seems to have been high bafflement at a production level over what on earth it actually was. Part comedy, part thriller, part fish-out-of-water social satire a la Doc Martin, it couldn\u2019t even decide in the thriller parts what kind of cop-shop drama it was going to be: at times a rompy tissued confection of Midsomer Murders flimsiness, yet with moments of the import and gravitas of an Endeavour. To his credit, ex-Brat Pack and West Wing heart-throb Rob Lowe, still wearing the years gossamer-lightly, and with those impossibly perfect Santa Barbara teeth, seemed remarkably unsurprised to find himself in the wilds of Boston, Lincolnshire, among the rain, and Brexit, and snaggle-toothed locals. Indeed, at times he seemed brimming with the confidence of the only person who actually knows what\u2019s going on. What\u2019s going on, nominally, is that a super-successful US cop, a backroom number-cruncher, finds himself and his beloved algorithms washed up (for reasons too complex yet dull to go into here) in pig-pen country. Which is, incidentally, filmed with some magnificence: were I the PR for the east Lincolnshire tourist board I would at least be happy for the beauty, if crying myself to sleep at the high (actual, true) murder rate and the extraordinarily high (actual, true) Leave vote. It\u2019s written by at least three people, and it shows, and hence surely the lack of confident self-identity. Thus the plot jumps and wriggles, not just in tone but in logical rigour: the chief constable (Lowe) is allegedly wedded to digital crime-solving, yet apparently investigates, in shirtsleeves and down shitskank sewers and the rest, every single case himself. There have been better pilot episodes. There have been worse, I\u2019m sure. Um\u2026 But carried with Lowe\u2019s confidence, and the skills of a rather fine supporting cast, it just about flies. Bronwyn James is wonderful as his equally capable deputy; Rachael Stirling as love-interest; Angela Griffin as a hack for the Boston Stump. Aloreia Spencer as Bill Hixon\u2019s sassy daughter, with whom Lowe shares most of his reveries and best lines. Many many niggles, but I actually loved it. Even Matt Berry couldn\u2019t save Year of the Rabbit from itself. A spoof Victorian London drama comedy of the sort seen only about a million times since the dawn of television, it wanted to be Ripper Street with giggles. It ended up being the Two Ronnies\u2019 \u201cphantom raspberry blower of old London town\u201d with, astonishingly, fewer laughs. And much much filth. The gags, it seems in hindsight, were all about disability, prostitutes and mud, and all done with a certain frenetic foul-mouthiness substituting for actual humour. I may have misread the opening episode, and it will doubtless be to the taste of some souls. But if this is the start of Channel 4\u2019s vaunted \u201csummer of comedy\u201d, bring on ye autumnal mists. I\u2019m proud to count myself a convert to women\u2019s (if not men\u2019s) football, and not just because my cousin\u2019s daughter last weekend skilfully carved her name into posterity as the first World Cup scorer for Scotland (a thrillzillion congratulations, Ms Emslie from all your Ferguson kin). Urgent and arty and gleeful, and so far without a sour male tantrummy rant, the women\u2019s game is, so arguably, what the \u201cbeautiful game\u201d was ever meant to be about, before the playground squalor and the racism and the rank fouls and the insane fees \u2013 and the coverage is hooking me. Twitter-spats about the \u201cgender-biased\u201d BBC panel (the likes of Gabby Logan, Alex Scott, Hope Solo and Gemma Fay attained insightful, analytical, professional levels that every bawbag-brained male pundit should shudder to dare to aspire to) being, all, um\u2026 women\u2026 leave me seething with headscratching wonderment. And, admittedly, a modicum of admiration for the mysteries of the universe: dinosaurs still exist! And some (like footballers) can be women!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
