Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes five and six of the second season \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please do not leave spoilers Plant a Tree, and Them and Us The idea of Katrine and Kasper as spin doctors, pitched against each other in the fight for opposing parties was almost too good to give up. It would have been amazing: a clash from which the Danish parliament might never have recovered. Sadly, such a tempting set-up was cruelly snatched from viewers just when it was starting to get interesting. Not least because of the idea that Katrine, a journalist so principled that she spends the majority of her time resigning over ethical issues, would have even considered becoming a spin doctor \u2013 let alone for a party she didn't support. Think what Kasper was doing as Katrine was admiring her new business cards: smearing Amir, the Green, in such a way that the poor man ended up leaving politics altogether. No wonder Hanne looked sceptical when Katrine told her what she had in mind. Yet this was still largely a set of episodes about the two Ks, who might finally stand a chance of being together. (Although only after Kasper shagged every attractive woman who crossed his path. His bum could have got its own credit this week.) I found Kasper's breakdown a little rushed and heavily underlined, his past rather suddenly brought out centre stage once more, but the construction of these episodes was clever, with Kasper's mental state mirroring Laura's problems, and Birgitte, close to both, not really engaging properly with either situation. The revelations about Kasper's childhood \u2013 his age at the time of stabbing his father suddenly extremely relevant thanks to the political debate over criminal responsibility \u2013 were also told well; the news reports were perhaps a cop-out in terms of dramatic storytelling, but I believed that they were the only way Kasper could tell Katrine about what had happened to him as a child. That he had to wait for the house to be finally sold made sense too. The politicians Be careful what you wish for Birgitte: a sharp shock to bring Amir back into line very quickly caught fire, leaving the environment minister at the mercy of the press. (Although, in theory, it was a story that could have erupted at any time: what was he thinking running such a gas-guzzler while campaigning for stronger green taxes?) I found the \"stand by your principles\", \"politics is all about compromise and pragmatism\" divide a little bit stark here, but I did enjoy the ambivalence around Birgitte's determination to secure broad cross-party support. Were her attempts to ensure her bill prevailed, even after a potential change of government, for the sake of her vanity, or those who would benefit from her welfare reforms? As is often the case, I'm still not sure whether Birgitte's motivation is power and maintenance of it, or a determination to represent all voters, and avoid entrenched party positions. Or indeed both. This ambiguity is Borgen's great strength for me \u2013 it's not afraid to ask questions of its heroine; to remind us that she did not become and stay statsminister by mistake, and that her ambition, drive, and ability to boss other ministers around \u2013 lots of that again this week \u2013 make her a pretty formidable proposition. We've been seeing less of the softer, at home side of Birgitte of late, but this week's episodes saw more of a focus on family, with Laura's panic attacks and psychological problems forcing Birgitte, Philip and Cecilie into sitting round a table and making decisions together. Although I must admit, if it turned out my ex with who I was still in love had a new girlfriend who happened to be the paediatrician who diagnosed my daughter as having problems which I wrote off as teenage angst \u2013 and who wouldn't? \u2013 only for said girlfriend to not only be proved right, but also be the only adult available to deal with the ensuing crisis, I might feel that fate, or indeed the drama storyliner, was being particularly cruel. Still, at least Birgitte wasn't having sex with random staff members this week. That much we can be grateful for. Also: Hanne's back! Even if Neils Erik was a bit cross about the effort involved in her transfer. Now we just need Bent to return to parliament. And Kasper of course, although I quite enjoyed Birgitte's line about him coming back once he had calmed down. I don't doubt it It was interesting to see Birgitte in parliamentary action these episodes. Usually she seems to spend most of her time watching the chamber on television, rather than actually attending. I was quite transfixed by the buttons/totaliser method when it came to voting. It was only missing Jeremy Vine and a bonkers graphic. The newsroom After a great deal of round-the-houses, Katrine finds herself back working with Torben Friis and the TV1 team. I'm quite relieved to find our favourite idealistic reporter back in the television studio, with the team effectively reunited thanks to Katrine's insistence that Hanne should also be reinstated: \"It's your responsibility to keep her sober,\" says Torben. I fear that might come back to haunt Katrine, but I loved that she fought for her former editor, unpredictable as she might be. Hanne and Katrine have been quite the best thing about this second series. Watching Katrine disobey orders when it came to interviewing Svend Age, much to the annoyance of everybody higher up at the station reminded me of how much the newspaper office was missing in comparison. I'm glad we're back. I'm also glad that we're hopefully over Katrine having to try out a new job every week \u2013 although oddly, I was quite interested to see just how bad Thicker Than Water really would have been. Other (presumably fictional) Danish TV shows I was interested in include: Dance, Dance, Dance, which must surely be Denmark's version of Strictly. Maybe Katrine could do the Christmas special in the manner of Natasha Kaplinksy. For those wondering about the staffing levels of Danish newsrooms, or the likelihood of former MP Michael Laugesen becoming a newspaper editor, I've been making a few enquiries \u2013 and Jakob Illeborg, a global correspondent for DR, based in London, has some thoughts (Thanks Jakob!): \"News organisations are significantly smaller and leaner in Denmark, so although clearly not representative, [the newsroom staffing] is probably not that far off \u2026 As a correspondent I have often bumped into British production crews around the world. I have always been amazed, and a bit envious, of the size of these crews compared to ours. However, I don't think that size always matters, at least on this subject. Danish TV journalism has won many international awards, and I personally think that the evening news bulletin on Danish TV often looks better and fresher than the British news stories.\" \"The idea of Laugesen becoming an editor is probably more unlikely. Actually it is often the other way around. The current EU climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, was a journalist and a presenter before she became a conservative politician.\" Thoughts and observations \u2022 As was noted, the age of criminal responsibility in the UK is just 10 years old. Campaigners, some of whom wrote to the Guardian last month, believe that is in urgent need of reform. \u2022 I really like the way Svend Age Saltum is written with enough charm to make you understand why people might vote for him. Worryingly, I wonder whether he'd really be seen as such an embarrassment to the right wing in Britain. \u2022 Pernille, on the other hand, is officially the least sympathetic character ever. Is there anyone in the world more sour? \u2022 The speaker of the house \u2013 or whatever the Danish parliamentary equivalent is \u2013 looked distractingly like Dick van Dyke. Has Dr Mark Sloan got a secret sideline? \u2022 Slightly odd that Birgitte summoned Laura's psychiatrist to come and talk her through the prescription, I thought. A phonecall would have done. Not least because that debate about anti-depressants seemed rather tacked on to the episode. (An aside: Birgitte seemed to be taking a lot of what I presume are painkillers this episode). \u2022 Poor Lotte. Although I'm amazed she stuck Kasper for as long as she did: workaholic, emotionally damaged, still in love with his ex, trying to shag everyone he comes across (the mysterious woman remains an enigma), forever forgetting dinner dates. And then the sex was rubbish too. \u2022 On which note: CURTAINS! \u2022 Not to make light of Kasper's terrible story \u2013 but it was extremely lucky that Katrine had a video player. Very few households (let alone ones that tiny) still contain VHS machines \u2022 Katrine's new salary is around \u00a360,000 a year \u2022 Scarf watch: the absolutely enormous number Hanne was sporting on the waterside made me laugh so hard I had to pause the action. Are they going to continue getting bigger every week? Will her face even be visible by the end? It's like a French and Saunders sketch. \u2022 Danish design lust: Lotte's candlesticks \u2022 Line of the night: \"Let's have a cup of Jytte's very bitter coffee.\" Related: as you all spotted, Birgitte was drinking gin, rather than Jager bombs last week. (Which admittedly, does make a great deal more sense). \u2022 An update on \"Shooting the parrot\". It's a Danish phrase meaning \"to strike gold,\" \"make a good deal\" etc. Thanks to LarsPal and Jakob \u00d8hlenschl\u00e6ger in the comments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
