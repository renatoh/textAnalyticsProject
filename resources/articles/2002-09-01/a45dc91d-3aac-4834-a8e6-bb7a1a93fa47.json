Yorkshire opener Vaughan, 27, continued his excellent form in 2002 with his fifth Test ton in all as England made merry against India after captain Nasser Hussain won a crucial toss at The Oval. India had entered this Test with the momentum of a victory at Headingley last week behind them, which levelled the series at 1-1. But the home side closed on a commanding 336 for two with Vaughan unbeaten on 182 and John Crawley 16 not out. Having begun the international season with a hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's, Vaughan claimed another at the same ground in a 170-run win over the Indians before registering a career-best 197 in the second Test at Trent Bridge. His feat is unmatched by a home batsman since Graham Gooch scored four hundreds against India and New Zealand 12 years ago. The previous men to complete a quartet of three-figure scores were Herbert Sutcliffe in the 1920s, Denis Compton in the 1940s and more recently Allan Lamb in 1984. The only non-Englishman to match Vaughan's achievement was Australian legend Sir Donald Bradman. Vaughan's only aberration was an error of judgment on 59 when he hit uppishly straight to mid-off and set off for a single. Partner Mark Butcher, who shared in a second-wicket stand of 174, declined the call and Sourav Ganguly's throw to the batsman's end failed to beat Vaughan's dive by a matter of an inch as third umpire Neil Mallender deliberated over numerous replays. Although not the most fluent innings initially, Vaughan's trademark cover drives provided the bulk of his runs and he reached a circumspect half-century from 92 deliveries shortly after lunch when he drove off the back foot for an eighth boundary. After a quiet period in the 80s, though, a late cut to the boundary off Anil Kumble took Vaughan to within three of his landmark and he reached 100 with a drive to mid-off where Ajit Agarkar misfielded to allow a scampered single. He punched the air with delight and then opened up, using his feet to twin-spin threat Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble to hit a number of boundaries. The returning Marcus Trescothick was the only wicket to fall in the first two sessions as a steepling hook off Zaheer Khan found its way to Sanjay Bangar at fine leg. Back in the side after a broken thumb sidelined him for six weeks, the left-handed Trescothick (57) dominated the opening stand of 98. Butcher weighed in with a more circumspect half-century, finally falling when an attempted sweep off Harbhajan ran off pad and the back of the bat to loop to Rahul Dravid at first slip. His 54, in over three hours, provided a backbone to the innings, however, which leaves England in a potentially prosperous position. Hussain did not come out in his customary number four position, however, as Crawley was promoted in the order. But England's progress continued unabated with Vaughan, who has stacked up more than 500 runs in this series, reaching his second 150 in Tests the delivery after striking his 21st four as he ran Agarkar down to third man. Indian captain Ganguly opted for the new ball as soon as it became available but with no success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
