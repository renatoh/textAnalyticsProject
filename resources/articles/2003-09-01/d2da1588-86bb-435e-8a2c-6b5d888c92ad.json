But for those who have travelled thousands of miles to study in a new country, these concerns are likely to be doubled. Fortunately, help is at hand in most universities. \"We have alumni nights for students in their home countries,\" says the international officer and director of the orientation induction course at the University of Birmingham. \"We call them up and they are usually happy to meet the new students and take them out for meals. Our aluminates are ex-students from the university. We had a Chinese student who is now on a 12-month contract with us. And because she knows Mandarin, it is really helpful to get her to contact students from China.\" While most universities arrange orientation for new students in the first week of the academic year, others may select a separate week specifically for international students, often the week before other students arrive. The week usually involves a range of social activities to introduce students to the university and the locality. Organised trips out and advice on what's available locally, such as transport and medical facilities, are usually included in the week. \"The induction course involves masters students, postgraduates, and undergraduates, \" explains a student organiser at Birmingham. \"We offer different activities, not only socials, but also relating to academic study. We have networking for the new students with their departments, so they can meet other current students and the staff.\" The induction days allow international students to \"go on tour around the guilds, sign up for volunteering and basically find out what they can do in and out of the university\", says the president of Birmingham's guild of students, Emma Lloyd. The National Union of Students encourages international students to make full use of their university unions, in particular their international societies. \"They help students to meet people from different countries and settle down,\" said a Japanese former student at York University. \"Taking a part in any of them would have widened the ring of friendship.\u00bfh An NUS spokesman adds: \"If you have any problems, academic or social, don't keep them inside you. Always speak with someone.\" The NUS has recently been campaigning to get fairer banking facilities for international students. \"Most banks operate restrictions when opening accounts, such as a minimum amount of money, or simply don't allow international students to do so, or under unfavourable terms,\" says a spokesman. It is also opposed to Home Office plans to charge visa renewal fees of up to \u00a3120, which would, it claims, create \"barriers to students coming to the UK\", and the high tuition costs for international students. The work of universities to accommodate international students is supported by an organisation that can be found advertising its work at freshers\u00bff fairs around the country. HOST (Hosting for Overseas Students), founded in 1987 by the British Council, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and The Victoria League, places overseas students with a UK host family for weekends and over the holiday seasons so they can experience family life even though they are away from home. \"We support HOST very much,\" says a spokesman from University College London. \"We advertise from the start of term and many students do take it up.\" Birmingham sends the most students from all universities to HOST families, claims its international officer. \"We promote actively in student guides. We are also inviting the British families and students who had been on the HOST programme to give a talk to the new students.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
