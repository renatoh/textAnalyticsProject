That was when a Californian jury decided the company had infringed some patents held by a French company, Alcatel, on the MP3 compression scheme which you and I and almost everyone else uses to store their music in. MP3 is as close to a universal standard as you will find in this business. It was invented in the early 1990s, in the course of a collaboration between Bell Labs, the legendary research arm of the American telephone company, and the Fraunhofer Institute, a state-sponsored German research organisation. Without Bell Labs' inventions, the modern world would not exist. The transistor came from there, and so did Unix. Along with IBM, it was one of the most effective examples of American innovation by private enterprise. In Europe, pure research was far more often funded by the state, usually through the university network. But it is one thing to change the world; another to profit from these changes. Bell Labs sold off its wonderful research lab in 1996, and it was acquired by Alcatel. The patents arising from the MP3 technology joint venture were thought by everyone to belong to Fraunhofer, which duly licensed them, and made a reasonable amount of money from this. Microsoft, for example, paid $16m to incorporate MP3 support into Windows Media Player. But when Alcatel brought the remains of Bell Labs, now known as Lucent Technologies, it behaved as any modern company would, and tried to squeeze maximum value from the patents it had acquired. It asserted that these covered some of the MP3 technology that everyone assumed Fraunhofer owned, and sued two PC companies - Dell and Gateway - for selling computers equipped to play MP3s. Microsoft promised to fight the suit on their behalf and so the case came eventually to court. It's hard to escape the suspicion that if any other company had been involved, the award might have been smaller; but if the decision stands, almost every other company in the business is threatened too. It's not just that Microsoft would be liable for royalties on every copy of Windows sold; Apple could be damaged by this decision, since every copy of iTunes can encode and decode MP3. Although Apple switched its default encoding to AAC with version 4 in the spring of 2003, that won't escape the patent. But at a cost of 5c per copy of iTunes, and billions in the bank, it might be less hurt than Microsoft. It would be hard to find a better illustration of the madness of modern intellectual property law. The real value of Bell Labs' work is almost immeasurable, yet in monetary terms nothing can have paid off so much as this one claim on a peripheral technology which most observers, before the verdict, were inclined to dismiss as quite unfounded. It might not have been quite as outrageous as BT's attempt to patent the hyperlink, or the claim which surfaced at the end of last week, by a Texan company to have patented the idea of an MP3 player, rather than the format itself. But it was an example of a widespread and dangerous trend. Submarine patents - those that surface only after the technologies they protect have come into wide use - are obviously dangerous. But even ordinary, open, honest patents now function as a brake on innovation. Microsoft itself, though the victim in this case, aggressively patents all that it can, and has lobbied for the extension of the American system to the EU. The idea that software should be possible to patent (rather than copyright) raises philosophical difficulties, but these pale beside the practical problem that only experienced software engineers can tell whether something is a real innovation in the field. The EU is considering the problem carefully. With any luck, the Microsoft judgement will serve as a terrible warning, even though Alcatel is in fact a French company. After all, if you wanted an illustration of the superiority of the European model of research and intellectual property formation, you could not find a better example than this case. \u00b7 thewormbook.com \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
