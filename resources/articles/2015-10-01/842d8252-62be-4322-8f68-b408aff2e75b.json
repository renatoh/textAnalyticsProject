Cuts to social care services in recent years have left more than a million people over 65 in England struggling on their own to undertake at least one basic task that is vital to their wellbeing, such as washing, getting dressed and feeding themselves. The last few years have also seen \u201calarming increases in hospital admissions for pneumonia, urinary tract infections and congestive heart failure for older people, which indicate deterioration in community health and social care services\u201d, according to the charity\u2019s first annual review of how NHS and social care services in England are performing. The report, based on an array of official statistics, shows that large numbers of older people are being admitted to hospital as medical emergencies because their illness has not been properly managed at home. \u201cAmbulatory care-sensitive conditions\u201d, such as pneumonia and congestive heart failure, account for 20% of all emergency admissions, costing the NHS \u00a31.4bn a year. Admissions for pneumonia among those aged over 60 more than doubled from 1,187 per 100,000 people in 2005-06 to 2,621 in 2013-14. The infection is potentially fatal and is involved in many elderly people\u2019s deaths. Similarly, urinary tract infections, which can cause kidney problems, fevers and delirium, soared by a \u201cstaggering\u201d 81% over the same period. Hospitalisaton for congestive heart failure and gastroenteritis both rose by 33% too. The charity said the fact that meals on wheels for elderly people were \u201crapidly falling away\u201d and there were too few family doctors as key reasons why older people\u2019s health needs were not being met, despite the ageing population. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said: \u201cOn the whole, it is the community-based services which help older people to sustain their independence which have seen the sharpest falls, or where supply is most obviously failing to meet rising demand. So, for example, GP numbers are not keeping up with a growing older population and meals-on-wheels provision, once a mainstay of community care, is rapidly falling away.\u201d The report said recent sharp rises in the number of people \u201ctrapped\u201d in hospital despite being fit to leave and patients being readmitted to hospital as emergency cases showed that local councils\u2019 decisions to \u201cstarve\u201d social care services of the money they needed was seriously undermining the operation of the NHS, especially hospitals. It added that: \u201cMore than a million older people in England now have at least one unmet need for social care, compared to 800,000 in 2010. This means they receive no help from their local authority, or from family, neighbours or friends.\u201d Calling for an urgent injection of cash into both services, it said: \u201cUnless there is significant change to the funding of our health and social care system for older people as a result of decisions taken in the government\u2019s spending review [next month], we look to the future with considerable foreboding.\u201d The Department of Health disputed the charity\u2019s claim that the social care budget had shrunk by \u00a31.85bn over the last decade and would fall by another \u00a3470m this year. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \u201cIn the period since these figures [2013-14], we\u2019ve taken significant action to ensure our ageing population gets necessary care. \u201cAll over 75s should now have a named GP responsible for overseeing their care to help prevent them ending up in hospital unnecessarily, and we\u2019ve set up a \u00a35.3bn fund that joins up health and social services.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
