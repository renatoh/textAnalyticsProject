But the influential cross-party group of MPs rejected claims that the Muslim community has been unreasonably targeted by the police use of stop and search powers. The MPs said there was a widespread perception in the Muslim community that they were being stigmatised by the war against terror. There needed to be a special effort made by the police and government to reassure them. In particular, much more detailed and accurate statistics were needed on terrorism-related detentions, arrests, charges and trials. John Denham, the Labour chairman of the committee, said it was essential that British Muslims be involved in the government's review of new and existing anti-terror laws and new measures are needed to support British Muslim leaders to resist extremists. A government research programme was needed to probe why \"a very small number of young Britons\" turn to violently extremist groups, and measures to deal with the problem needed to be developed. The report of the inquiry into the impact of the anti-terror laws on community relations also concluded that much greater recognition needed to be given to tackling the problems of Islamophobia and anti-semitism. \"Community relations have deteriorated, although the picture is by no means uniform, and there are many positive examples to set against our overall assessment,\" said the MPs. They added that while the growth of international terrorism had contributed to the rise in tension, particularly between the majority community and the Muslim community, it was not the only root cause. Communal violence in India, the Kashmir dispute and the Israel-Palestine conflict were also reflected in deepening tensions in Britain. The MPs looked into the use of anti-terror stop and search powers by the police but concluded that the Muslim community was not being unreasonably targeted. The large majority of stop and searches took place in London where the proportion of Asians targeted was \"very close\" to their proportion in the overall population. The MPs conceded, however, that many in the Muslim community believed they were being stigmatised, and recommend that community leaders should be involved in independent scrutiny of the police intelligence that led to the stop and search operations. The MPs also carefully examined the existing available statistics on the 702 arrests under the anti-terror laws between 9/11 and December 2004. They found that although half had been released without charge, 350 had been charged under anti-terror and other legislation. The committee confirmed that so far only 17 people had been convicted for terrorist offences; only 3 were Islamists and 7 were Irish. Mr Denham said: \"The Muslim community in Britain overwhelmingly rejects terrorism. The stereotyping of the Muslim community was rightly criticised in our inquiry. The government needs to bring together its support for community cohesion with its anti-terror strategy and certainly needs to ensure that the Muslim community are fully involved in developing the next steps in tackling terrorism.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
