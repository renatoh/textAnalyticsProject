Leicester, like Wimbledon, have suffered financially from the effects of being relegated from the Premiership but there the similarities end. Whereas the Foxes have emerged from administration almost free of the debts that threatened to destroy them, at liberty to play in their new stadium and on course for a return to the Premiership, Wimbledon are set for relocation in Milton Keynes. It is an unpopular move among supporters but they have no say, unlike the Leicester fans who voted on the proposal to revert to the club's original name of Leicester Fosse. The idea was overwhelmingly rejected in a half-time poll, a result that dismayed tatooists hoping for fresh custom but delighted the tatooed: opponents to the change supported by the new chairman Jon Holmes included those with \"City forever\" inscribed indelibly on various parts of their anatomies. A less permanent way of expressing allegiance is buying the club's shirt and business in those bearing the number 22, as worn by Paul Dickov, is expected to boom. Not only did the striker score a hat-trick that ensured a landslide to mirror the outcome of the half-time election, he is also keen to extend his stay at the Walkers Stadium when his contract expires at the end of the season. \"Talks about a new deal are on hold until the club know what division they will be playing in next season,\" said Dickov. \"At the moment the club is not in a position to make any decision on new contracts because of its financial position. But I'm happy to wait because I love it here.\" Dickov has more than repaid Leicester's faith, not that there was much to repay considering they paid Manchester City only \u00a350,000 for him. The hat-trick took his tally for the season to 19 but Wimbledon's manager Stuart Murdoch was left fuming after two penalties helped him on his way. \"The first was harsh and the second ludicrous,\" he said after Jermaine Darlington and Rob Gier were penalised for shirt-pulling and handball respectively. Murdoch had the grace to concede that Leicester were the better team. And as if to prove the point, Trevor Benjamin and Dickov scored from open play to complete the rout. Man of the match: Paul Dickov (Leicester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
