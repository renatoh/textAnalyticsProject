At its entrance hang two flags rippling in the scorching breeze: one of Qatar, the other of Cuba. The hospital belongs to the Qatar government, but its entire medical staff \u2013 475 doctors, nurses and technicians \u2013 is from the Caribbean island half a world away. The Cuban hospital, as it is officially known, opened in 2012, boasting world class facilities and services. But there is one thing that is not up to international standards: the salaries the Cubans are paid. At just over $1,000 (\u00a3778) a month, they receive as little as 10% of what other foreign medical professionals can make working in government hospitals in Qatar. The remainder of their earnings are pocketed by the Cuban government under a secret deal with the Qataris. Neither the Qatari or Cuban authorities would reveal details of the agreement, but sources with knowledge of the hospital estimate Qatar pays Cuba between $5,000 and $10,000 a month for each medical professional. Cuba has been sending doctors around the world since the early 1960s; there are currently an estimated 30,000 Cuban doctors and nurses working in 60 countries. Starting with missions to Algeria and Chile, the programme has grown into a global exercise in soft power driven by humanitarian, political and economic goals. Cuban medical teams are often at the forefront of disaster relief efforts in Latin America. Leasing doctors to other countries is the main source of hard currency for Cuba\u2019s cash-strapped economy, earning the government $6-8bn a year \u2013 far more than it makes from tourism. In the past decade, partly prompted by declining revenue from its medical programme in Venezuela, Cuba has turned to new countries with no shortage of money: Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In a similar arrangement with Brazil, the Cuban government was reportedly paid about $4,000 a month for each medic, of which the doctors received $1,000. When the rightwing Jair Bolsonaro, an opponent of Cuba, took power in Brazil last year, thousands of Cuban doctors left the country, prompting fears that poor areas of Brazil would be left without sufficient medical care. Cuba is not the only country that exports its citizens to earn foreign currency. North Korea has also sent workers to Qatar under a programme with some similarities. Although doctors sign up voluntarily to take part in the missions, US-based critics of the Cuban government say the programme is exploitative. \u201cI have no doubt that they are subject to a form of compelled labour \u2026 Cuba is a totalitarian state with a guaranteed pool of captive low-paid workers easily exploited as exportable commodities,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Werlau, the director of Cuba Archive, a Miami-based thinktank opposed to the Cuban administration. Werlau says Cuba\u2019s medics are victims of wage theft, passport confiscation, heavy surveillance and forced family separation. Amid deteriorating relations between the two countries, the US has recently increased criticism of the medical missions. In June, the State Department downgraded Cuba to the lowest tier of its Trafficking in Persons report, saying: \u201cThe [Cuban] government did not take action to address forced labour in the foreign medical missions programme, despite persistent allegations Cuban officials threatened and coerced some participants to remain in the programme.\u201d However, others argue the medical missions are highly-coveted opportunities in a country where doctors earn just $40 to $70 a month. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that they are being exploited,\u201d says John Kirk, professor of Spanish and Latin American studies at Dalhousie University in Canada. \u201cThey are earning significantly more than they would earn at home. They have been trained in a socialist system, have paid nothing for their medical training, and understand that the superior amount paid to the Cuban government is used to subsidise the healthcare system back in Cuba.\u201d The Guardian spoke to several medics at the Cuban hospital and some defended the system. \u201cI believe we should help everybody,\u201d says one. \u201cBased on that, yes it is fair, because I know that the other amount is used to support our health and education system \u2026 but if you think only of yourself, of course it\u2019s not fair.\u201d But a medic who defected from the mission in Qatar says he \u201cfelt like a slave\u201d on discovering that other doctors in the country were being paid more than him. \u201cWe were doing the same thing and earning far less than them.\u201d One reason doctors join the programme is that, even allowing for deductions made by their government, Qatar remains a lucrative and sought-after posting for Cuban healthcare professionals. With such paltry salaries at home, its attraction is obvious. \u201cLife in our country is very hard and the salary is very bad,\u201d says one medic at the hospital. \u201cHere we earn money for [Cuba] and for us too \u2026 One part for the country, and one part for each person.\u201d No one knows the exact amount the Cuban government is earning from their labour, and some seem not to care. \u201cThe education in Cuba is free. The government prepares us for many years and so the government needs to take something for this,\u201d says one. Others sound less convinced. \u201cI earn about $1,100. It\u2019s not the best, but its not bad.\u201d Told that other foreign medical professionals earn far more in Qatar, he nods in agreement, \u201cYes, but not Cuban people.\u201d The medics say their families are allowed to visit, but not stay \u2013 a policy critics claim is a deliberate strategy to deter defections. Anyone who abandons a medical mission is barred from returning to Cuba \u2013 and their family \u2013 for a minimum of eight years, unless they are willing to rejoin the national health system. \u201cThey are using what they love the most to make them think twice before leaving. It\u2019s cruel, it\u2019s inhumane, it\u2019s unconstitutional and against international law,\u201d says Annarella O\u2019Mahony, a member of No Somos Desertores (\u201cWe are not deserters\u201d), a group that campaigns for the right of Cubans who have abandoned state contracts to return home. Anyone attempting to leave faces another problem: on arrival in Qatar, Cubans say they have to hand over their passports, a practice that is illegal in Qatar. Qatar recently announced reforms to its labour laws, which for the first time may allow workers to change jobs without their employer\u2019s permission, but it is unclear whether the Cuban medics will be free to find more lucrative work elsewhere in Qatar\u2019s healthcare system. Up until 2017, Cuban medical professionals who wanted to leave could seek asylum in a US embassy under a programme introduced by President George Bush in 2006. The defector from the Cuban hospital, who left in this way, says he knows of 16 others who did the same, though he was driven less by conditions in Qatar and more by the opportunity for a new life in America. Barack Obama withdrew the legislation just before he left office in 2017 as part of efforts to normalise relations with Cuba. \u201cNow they are trapped again,\u201d says the defector. Despite being cut off from his family in Cuba, the defector says he has no regrets about leaving. \u201cI tell my mother when I talk by phone that, despite all the difficulties and pain, I would do it again. I will never return to Cuba. There is no future there.\u201d A spokesperson for the Hamad Medical Corporation, the government body that manages healthcare in Qatar, including the Cuban Hospital said: \u201cAs with similar Cuban health programmes around the world, salaries of hospital staff are paid for by the Cuban government.\u201d The Guardian repeatedly approached the Cuban embassy in Qatar for comment, but received no response."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
