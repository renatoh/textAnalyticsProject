As Latin America\u2019s worst hit country, Brazil officially has 9,056 coronavirus cases \u2013 including actors, singers, government ministers and Fabio Wajngarten, press secretary of the president, Jair Bolsonaro. With 14 million Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where basic sanitation is frequently lacking, informal workers are struggling from lost income during lockdown, and social isolation is challenging or impossible. The first case has already been reported in an Amazon indigenous community. Bolsonaro called the pandemic a \u201clittle flu\u201d and insisted Brazilians would be immune because they were used to jumping in sewage. His government has distributed just 54,000 tests for a population of about 210 million. Last month the health ministry stopped releasing the numbers of suspected cases. \u201cIn Brazil that\u2019s certainly a critical issue, if not a crisis,\u201d said Albert Ko, department chair and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, noting that widespread testing helped Taiwan, South Korea and Germany blunt the epidemic\u2019s rise. \u201cIt is clear we have to improve the issue of tests, and improve a lot,\u201d health minister Luiz Mandetta told reporters this week. Estimates vary wildly. This week, Edmar Santos, health secretary for Rio de Janeiro, said the state could have 50 to 100 infected people for each of its 1,074 confirmed cases. Brazil\u2019s official toll of 359 deaths is just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Fernando Bozza, a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz who is modelling the pandemic. \u201cYou have a mountain of other deaths that are either directly or indirectly associated with the epidemic and they are not notified.\u201d R\u00eallo, who works in private and public hospitals in Rio, said test results can take up to seven days to arrive. She dealt with three deaths last week alone but results confirming coronavirus arrived after the patients had died \u2013 meaning they did not enter the count. The notification systems she deals with vary from handwritten forms to online ones. \u201cI\u2019m just one doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number I am seeing of critically ill patients, of what I see and what people I know tell me about, does not match the number being disclosed.\u201d She and other doctors are worried about running short of personal protection equipment before the full force of the pandemic has hit. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic, many cases arriving,\u201d said Rodolfo Espinoza, a doctor working in Rio\u2019s intensive care wards. \u201cWe know there are many suspected cases with no diagnosis.\u201d In S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil\u2019s most populous with 44 million people and 4,048 cases, the government laboratory handling tests has a backlog of 16,000, state health secretary Jos\u00e9 Germann said on Wednesday. At the Em\u00edlio Ribas public hospital in the state capital, tests are taking up to 15 days to come back, said Ana Ribeiro, its epidemiological service coordinator. The hospital \u2013 one of Brazil\u2019s most respected infectious disease institutions \u2013 is currently waiting for 134 test results, including those of three who have died. \u201cThere are many people getting symptoms and they cannot handle it,\u201d Ribeiro said. Cemeteries in S\u00e3o Paulo are burying 30 to 40 people a day with coronavirus symptoms but, in most cases, no test result, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper reported. The non-profit group Viva Rio runs six health centres, called UPAs, in Rio de Janeiro, all near favelas and all almost exclusively dealing with respiratory cases. \u201cPeople are not going to UPAS for other reasons,\u201d said general coordinator Jos\u00e9 Pacheco. \u201cI just select the most vulnerable or most serious to test; the vast majority are not tested.\u201d S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, the second biggest city in Rio state, has 10 confirmed cases. Resident Fab\u00edola Lima, a financial specialist, believes there are many more. She lives with her three sisters, all of whom went to private hospitals after suffering classic coronavirus symptoms like fever, headaches and dry coughs. They were told tests were not available, and sent home. They too were not included in the official tally. \u201cThis number being released is totally unreal. This makes people think everything\u2019s normal,\u201d Lima said, while her sister Christiane, coughed incessantly in the background. Despite outbreaks of Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever in recent years, the past three Brazilian governments slashed funding for science and technology, said Rodrigo Brindeiro, a molecular biologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who helped design the test Fiocruz uses. Brazil is now competing in international markets to buy the test ingredients it needs. \u201cOur failure was long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that if the diagnosis does not improve rapidly there will be a lot of underreporting in these favelas of Rio and this is extremely worrying.\u201d In an email, the health ministry said 40,000 more molecular tests were being delivered this week and another 15 million \u201care being acquired\u201d. It has taken delivery of half a million antibody tests donated by mining giant Vale, which is expected to deliver millions more. Mandetta said the antibody tests have \u201cvarious degrees of sensitivity\u201d. Health ministry documents sent to states and towns said the tests were probably just 25% accurate in diagnosing negative cases. These antibody tests will only spot people carrying coronavirus four to seven days after they become infected, said Brindeiro. As Brazilians chafed under lockdown and largely ignored Bolsonaro\u2019s demands to get back to work, there are signs that many people also sought reliable information instead of his anti-science, anti-media, populist posturing. Brazil\u2019s biggest newspaper, the Folha de S Paulo \u2013 which Bolsonaro has described as \u201cgarbage\u201d \u2013 reported a record 70 million readers in March. An interview with biologist Atila Iamarino Iamarino on the TV show Roda Viva this week drew its biggest audience since Bolsanaro himself appeared in 2018, and has been viewed 3 million times on YouTube. Concerns over the lack of testing were voiced. \u201cYou have the tests, which are the flashlight you can point in any direction and know what\u2019s happening there,\u201d said Iamarino. \u201cWithout this flashlight, what you can use is a candle.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
