More than 3,000 people were killed in the ensuing riots, most of them Muslims. Since then the sleepy temple town in north India has been tied with the rise of Hindu extremism. A special court in northern India said Mr Advani, along with seven other rightwing Hindu leaders, had made \"provocative speeches\" to crowds that had massed on the site in Ayodhya where many Hindus believe the warrior god Ram was born. Mr Advani had been acquitted by judges of similar charges in September 2003. But this month the high court in Uttar Pradesh overturned that ruling and asked the lower court to try him again. If convicted, Mr Advani, who is now the leader of the opposition and president of the Bharatiya Janata party, could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. Many independent analysts say the manner in which charges have been dropped and reinstated in the past 24 months has cast doubt on the impartiality of the process. \"There is a huge question mark over the neutrality of the investigation,\" said Rajdeep Sardesai, the editor in chief of Global Broadcast News. \"When the BJP was in power the charges were withdrawn. But they are continued when the Congress is in power.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
