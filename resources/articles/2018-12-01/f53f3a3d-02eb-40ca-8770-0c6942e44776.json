Passengers stood in long queues at check-in desks and information points, trying to establish when \u2013 or if \u2013 they would be able to travel. Others, already dispirited by news of long delays, sat slumped on floors and in packed cafes, many with large piles of bags that they had not been able to check in. The sighting of drones over the runway overnight at the West Sussex airport had ruined plans for thousands of Christmas holidaymakers. The runway was closed after the drones were sighted at 9pm on Wednesday. On Thursday evening, the airport\u2019s chief operating officer, Chris Woodroofe, said it was impossible to tell when flights would resume. Zak Morgan, 20, a computer science student at UCL, had been waiting since 8.45pm on Wednesday for what should have been a 30-minute flight to Paris. He had made it on board, only to sit there for hours, before being told to get off. The journey was rescheduled via Barcelona, to depart at 3pm. But that flight was also cancelled. Asked why he didn\u2019t just go home, he said: \u201cEvery hour they have been changing the flight times, so instead of saying go home, they\u2019ve been telling us to stay.\u201d Arthur Serbejs, 22, and Domante Balciunate, 21, factory workers from Hastings, had been waiting just as long. They were sitting on the floor by a prayer room, approaching their 19th hour of waiting for a flight to Barcelona. \u201cWe came about 6pm yesterday,\u201d Serbejs said. \u201cAt 9pm yesterday we were on the plane for four hours \u2013 they turned the lights off and everything, like it was going to take off.\u201d \u201cBut we were still sitting there,\u201d Balciunate added. Serbejs said he fell asleep hoping to wake up in Spain, \u201cand I woke up and we hadn\u2019t moved\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t even expect to go to Barcelona any more,\u201d Balciunate said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s another drone up there, but we have hope. There\u2019s a prayer room over there, we were thinking about going.\u201d They had been offered a hotel during their wait, but declined it because they live so nearby. Others were more or less stranded, and couldn\u2019t go home even if they had wanted. Renata Alinta, 50, was sitting on the floor waiting with her three sons, aged nine, eight and six, after arriving via a circuitous route from Northern Ireland. They were aiming for a flight to the Dominican Republic, where they hope to spend Christmas. Their original flight from Belfast to Gatwick had been cancelled, but after BA said the connection to the Caribbean was still likely to depart she had paid for another flight to Stansted, then taken a cab. The detour had cost her an extra \u00a3430. Now her two younger boys were rolling about on the floor in frustration, while the eldest, who was suffering from a cold, dozed with his head in her lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting since 5am for information and we don\u2019t know if it [the flight] is going to be cancelled,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our first holiday to the Caribbean and everybody is upset \u2026 There are no places to sit, so we are just relaxing. We can\u2019t even get food because people are sitting down in all the cafes.\u201d By the early afternoon, Gatwick\u2019s coffee shops were beginning to run out of food, yet remained full of dozens of weary travellers. Groups clustered around power points, some laughing and joking in solidarity, others staring into glowing portals of escapism. Staff appeared swamped. Much of the misery in the south terminal was centred on a near 300-yard, slowly moving queue for an information desk. Rebecca Dahl, 20, from Copenhagen, was about three-quarters of the way to the front, having been queuing for three hours. Her flight was expected to depart at 6am on Friday but she was desperate to rebook her flight with Norwegian Air. \u201cI\u2019m hoping there\u2019s another one that\u2019s earlier because I have no place to stay and I don\u2019t have any money,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe they can hook me up with a hotel or something.\u201d Maria Vega, also 20, who was hoping to fly with Norwegian to Las Vegas to go home for Christmas, said she had been waiting in the queue for about 70 minutes and had moved just 30 or 40 feet. Her flight had been delayed for eight hours. \u201cPatience is a virtue \u2013 that\u2019s what my mum tells me, but I think I\u2019m going to crack by hour five,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just waiting here then having to go on an 11-hour flight.\u201d By the afternoon crowds in the north terminal were beginning to thin after easyJet cancelled all its shorthaul flights. Rajiv Mandve, 40, and his wife and daughter had been hoping to travel with the airline to Gibraltar but were sitting on the floor waiting for a cab home to Slough. \u201cWe waited in a queue for about three-and-a-half hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that we went to another desk to get some other flight where we waited for about two-and-a-half hours \u2013 and there was only one lady helping.\u201d The chaos had left them about \u00a3300 out of pocket. But travel insurance wouldn\u2019t pay, Mandve said. Drones were not covered by the policy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
