For the third time this year the company - which, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is the proud owner of the world's oldest brand name, Lyle's Golden Syrup, and which is still appropriately based on London's Sugar Quay - put out a profits warning. But this one was not just the result of an underperforming division or single poorly selling line. This was a whopper, with bad news from almost every corner of the company. The shares closed at 400.5p, down a huge 157p - or 28%. Ten months ago they were changing hands at 820p - valuing the business at more than \u00a34bn. It is now valued at less than \u00a32bn and unless the price recovers the company - one of the few original members of the FTSE 100 in 1984 still in existence - will be booted out of the blue-chip index by the end of this year. Cubed sugar Tate &amp; Lyle is not one of the UK's most glamorous companies. It may still be best known for the sickly syrup that no pancake is complete without, but the modern Tate &amp; Lyle is a global manufacturer of \"renewable food and industrial ingredients\". The group traces its roots back to the 19th century and the sugar-cane refining businesses of Henry Tate - who introduced the sugar cube to Britain and went on to found the Tate Gallery - and Abram Lyle. The two businessmen owned nearby refineries in east London with Tate producing cubes and Lyle turning out Golden Syrup. The two merged in 1921 and by 1939 their Thames factory was the largest sugar-cane refinery in the world. In 1965 a period of diversification began, into starch production in the US, sugar refining abroad, citric acid (used in everything from flavour enhancers in food to metal polish and cough mixture) and salmon feed for farmed fish. In 1976, working with researchers from Queen Elizabeth College at the University of London, Tate &amp; Lyle discovered the calorie-free sweetener Sucralose. It was developed by Tate and a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson but in 2004, renamed Splenda, Tate &amp; Lyle became the sole manufacturer and seller. Today the company operates 65 production plants in 29 countries transforming cereals and sugar into ingredients for industries ranging from food and drinks to pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, paper and packaging. Its products range from Splenda to modified food starch - which gives fruit pies their sheen - to industrial starches used in paper production, fuel-grade ethanol and animal feed. The latest bad news highlighted a host of problems. Its sugar trading business had a very bad August and has experienced \"a substantial reduction\" in performance. After a \u00a315m profit last year, it will now be in the red. The weak dollar is also having an impact as US earnings are translated into sterling. That will cost another \u00a312m. In the US, sales and profits of so-called \"value-added starches\" have improved but that benefit has been offset by weaker ethanol profits. There are other problems ahead: the EU has banned imports of US corn gluten - a by-product of maize processing used as animal feed - after a non-Tate &amp; Lyle product was found to have come from a genetically modified maize banned in Europe. The result is a glut in the US that has depressed prices. Elsewhere, higher maize prices in Europe - French corn is up 53% year-on-year - will have what Tate described as \"an increasingly severe effect on the profitability\" of the European ingredients business. The group's Splenda sweetener - which is 600 times sweeter than sugar and used in thousands of drinks and foods - is also failing to make much progress. This is a particular blow. Last year Splenda was viewed as Tate's future: a high-margin, value-added product protected by patents, which would help it become less reliant on the vagaries of the commodity markets. Too bullish With concerns about obesity mounting, the group had high hopes for the brand. Instead, poor sales prompted the first profits warning of the year, with Iain Ferguson, chief executive, explaining that the product tasted too much like real sugar and diet drink buyers preferred something more artificial. Ferguson said he had been \"too bullish\" about its prospects. Now the company is being forced to defend its patents against Chinese pirate manufacturers. The group's directors are far from upbeat. \"Given the importance of these factors, the board views the near-term outlook with caution,\" Tate&amp; Lyle said. As for the City's analysts, they are split. David Hallam at Evolution reckons the bad news is a big buying opportunity, and is keeping his 820p target for the shares, while Jeremy Batstone-Carr, at Charles Stanley, is urging shareholders to reduce their holdings. \"This is a difficult period for Tate,\" he said. Explainer: The world's oldest brand Not many products found in kitchen cupboards feature quotations from the Bible on their label. But look closely at Tate &amp; Lyle's famous Golden Syrup tin (or squeezable plastic bottle) and a quote from Samson appears underneath an image of a dead lion and a swarm of bees: \"Out of the strong came forth sweetness.\" Those who know their book of Judges (14:14) will know that it is the second part of a quote that begins: \"Out of the eater came forth meat\" - an obscure quotation known as Samson's riddle. It is also something of a riddle as to why it appears on the label, although it is known that Abram Lyle, the Scottish founder of half of the company, was a religious man. It seems clear what the sweetness refers to. But any connection between Samsonian strength and consuming lots of the sticky yellow contents with your pancakes seems more linked to Victorian marketing hyperbole. The syrup - a by-product of refining sugar - was first eaten by workers at Lyle's factory in east London but went on to greater things. The tin's distinctive design has changed little since it was first launched in 1885. Last year, the Guinness Book of Records named the brand the oldest in the world and the company estimates that it alone is worth millions. \"The Lyle's Golden Syrup tin is itself a piece of history,\" said Dr Kate Thomas, an expert on Victorian culture at Bryn Mawr College, Philadelphia. \"Its image of the lion and the bees and the biblical quotation testify to a peculiarly Victorian mix of moralism, industrial drive and budding concern for social welfare.\" Martin Farrer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
