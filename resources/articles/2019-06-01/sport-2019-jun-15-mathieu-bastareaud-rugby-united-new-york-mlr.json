In Manhattan for the first time, he has simply spent most of his time looking up at buildings even bigger than he is. \u201cThis is maybe the city that is the most attractive in the world,\u201d says a man who started his career in Paris and has spent the last eight years in the Mediterranean port of Toulon. \u201cI know from the TV shows, CSI and Friends and things like that! I was very excited on the plane. I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d It seems so. Shortly after our conversation, the 6ft 1in, 300lb centre formally signs for Rugby United New York. The franchise already employs the England full-back Ben Foden and it has pulled off a significant coup by engaging the Frenchman for 2020, the third season of Major League Rugby. Bastareaud will earn the top MLR salary of $45,000. The deal is done, it\u2019s not a loan, and as L\u2019Equipe put it, \u201cBig Basta \u00e0 Big Apple\u201d. It is not guaranteed he will return to Toulon once he\u2019s done. When the move was announced in April, the Top 14 season remained to be completed. Toulon missed the playoffs so here Bastareaud is, a week before the French World Cup squad is named. Presuming he\u2019s picked for Japan, and presuming he avoids harm in \u201cpool of death\u201d games against England, Argentina, Tonga and USA and whatever might come after, he will return to New York in December. Speaking softly, the English he says he wants to improve a thousand times better than the Guardian\u2019s French, Bastareaud confirms that his motivation for the move was a break from the grind of Europe. \u201cI played 12 seasons in France,\u201d he says, \u201ceight in Toulon. I\u2019ve won everything I wanted to win and I wanted a new challenge. But for me the big challenge is going outside Europe, and to come here was a big opportunity because the franchise starts at the beginning, and I love that. \u201cThe Top 14 is a lot of players coming from New Zealand, South Africa\u201d \u2013 he confirms that he talked to the Sharks of Durban but says a move was not a real prospect \u2013 \u201cand the level is very high. For me, I don\u2019t come here for a holiday. Not for me. I don\u2019t like when we say I come here for the break. I just want change. I play eight seasons in Toulon and every time it was the same. I want to change everything.\u201d A man will think that way when, as Bastareaud says, he has played \u201cmaybe 25 games\u201d of punishing pro rugby this season and yet \u201cit\u2019s not a lot\u201d next to previous workloads of \u201c37, 38 games\u201d for club and country. There are off-field factors too. The impending arrival of his first child, a son, means he will bring a young family with him. They will have about a month to acclimatise before MLR kicks off in February. \u201cFor me it is important to play in another country, just for learning other cultures, because maybe in France we are \u2026\u201d He seeks a little translation help from Pierre Arnald, the former Stade Fran\u00e7ais executive who is now a RUNY investor. \u201cNot open-minded.\u201d For a writer from Brexit Britain who works in Trump\u2019s America, that\u2019s rather hard to accept. But never mind. As on the field, where he can leave defences scattered in twitching pieces, Bastareaud ploughs on. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t understand why I come here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think in one season they will change their opinion.\u201d As MLR concludes its second season, its newest signing has followed it as many fans do, via Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. He agrees the rugby is more open than in Europe, the ball moved more, more tries scored thanks in part to relatively raw defences. \u201cFor me it\u2019s good,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s just playing rugby, [the teams] do not think about pressure, maybe there is more [opportunity] for me to enjoy my rugby. No relegation too, of course. When you don\u2019t have relegation in your head I think it\u2019s better in terms of negative pressure from outside. You can just think about the rugby.\u201d He has talked to Samu Manoa, the American flanker who shone with Northampton, won European Cups in Toulon and then came back to the US via Cardiff. Manoa now plays for the Seattle Seawolves, the MLR champions who defend their title in San Diego on Sunday night. \u201cSamu has told me he will give me a special welcome,\u201d Bastareaud says, laughing, utterly delighted at the thought of apocalyptic confrontations to come. \u201cYes, yes! Every time we talk, he says, \u2018I\u2019m coming for you!\u2019\u201d That should wet the whistles of the MLR marketing men: Big Basta versus the Block Monsta, an old-world collision on rugby\u2019s new frontier. Another punishing aspect of MLR is the necessary travel: RUNY v Seattle, for example, means a near-6,000-mile round trip. Undaunted, Bastareaud professes to welcome such long hauls as a way to see \u201cnew cities and new cultures\u201d, although in fact they will be fewer in 2020 as the league splits into eastern and western conferences, with the addition of Boston, Washington and Atlanta. Home or away, he will still face rugby players from New Orleans, Houston, Austin and Colorado. And when RUNY get good ball going forward, those players will line up to meet him head-on. \u201cI have come to win,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I also come for a challenge with the American players, to have a mutual exchange, to learn from them but to give to them too. It\u2019s different from in Europe. I want to live like an American man!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
