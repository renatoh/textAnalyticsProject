Unfortunately they lack a world-class team to match, and last night they had to endure the familiar sight of their World Cup qualifying chances fast disappearing into the night as Ukraine outclassed them for large parts of an entertaining game. Mark Hughes's side needed three points from this match to retain any realistic chance of challenging for second place, but not for the first time in this campaign they threw away a lead after John Hartson's third goal in two games, and had to settle for a fourth successive draw. It was no help to Hughes to be without three of his more experienced midfielders. Leicester's Robbie Savage and Everton's Mark Pembridge were injured, and Charlton's John Robinson suspended. As soon as Giggs pronounced himself fit for this game he was immediately propelled into the position of potential savour. As if to lift some of the weight on him, Wales took the lead on 11 minutes with a goal conjured up by the Barnsley full-back Darren Barnard, who swung in a cross from the left that Gary Speed flicked onto Hartson. The big Coventry striker needed no second bidding, and with a lunge of a foot by the far post volleyed the ball past Olexander Shovovski. That turned out to be Wales's only chance of the first half as they struggled to keep possession for any length of time. The test for the home side moved to the other end of the pitch, where a defence containing three players from the First Division pitted its wits against a Ukraine attacking force that blended movement, invention and versatility in a dangerous brew. The strike force of Milan's Andriy Shevchenko and Tottenham's Sergei Rebrov roamed either side of the central striker Andrii Vorobiei as various midfielders and defenders joined in with a bewildering pattern of runs that pulled the Wales back line all over the wide pitch. But with a dogged determination and a succession of last-minute interventions Wales held out. Paul Jones did well to block a shot from Vorobiei, who had been put through early on. Shevchenko cut in dangerously from the left to shoot just wide, Vorobiei's shot was just cleared for a corner, and seconds before half-time Mark Delaney got a foot in to divert Serhiy Popov's goalbound shot over the bar. However, few teams can concede so much possession and soak up so much pressure without buckling. And sure enough Ukraine equalised six minutes into the second half. Rebrov had been replaced at half-time by Vasyl Kardash and the right-sided midfielder made an immediate impact. Linking cleverly down the left with Andrii Nesmachnyi, he played in the attacking full-back close to the by-line. As Robert Page and Matthew Jones, the Leicester midfielder, both lunged in for the tackle, Nesmachnyi managed to squeeze the ball across the face of goal, where Shevchenko scored one of the easiest goals of his illustrious career, tapping the ball home from about a foot. Wales suffered another blow when Jones, whose tenacious contribution in front of the back four had played a large part in Wales's first half clean sheet, was forced off after picking up an injury in the tackle. But slowly Wales began to creep back into the game. A brave decision by Hughes to switch to 4-3-3, with Craig Bellamy up alongside Giggs and Hartson, gave Ukraine more to think about. Passing and possession improved and Hartson twice brought saves out of Shovovski while Speed had a decent penalty shout turned down after what looked like a push. Wales (4-1-3-2): P Jones (Southampton); Delaney (Aston Villa), Page (Watford), Melville (Fulham), Barnard (Barnsley) ; M Jones (Leicester); Bellamy (Coventry), Robinson (Wolves), Speed (Newcastle); Giggs (Manchester U), Hartson (Coventry). Ukraine (4-3-2-1): Shovovski; Luzhny, Vaschuk, Holovko, Nesmachnyi; Popov, Tymoschuk, Yashkin; Rebrov, Shevchenko; Vorobiei.
