You can tell me when it\u2019s over, if the high was worth the pain\u2026\u201d Swift has been a sane voice for England fans at this tournament, appearing on the PA in the middle of unanticipated defeats and urging them to Shake it Off. Sunday\u2019s rendition of Blank Space shone a profound and mystical light on Eoin Morgan\u2019s team. England: young, reckless, capable of leaving you breathless. Or, indeed, with a nasty scar. Having spent the past few days table-watching, England fans now had to watch their team, and there was no guarantee it would be any more pleasant than a bout of abstract mathematics. The teams followed out those giant lollipop balloons with customary obedience \u2013 does it make anyone else think of The Prisoner? \u2013 and assembled for their anthems. England stood in their school-photo pose, arms tucked scout-style behind their backs. The Indian players\u2019 limber limbs fell more relaxedly by their side, as they reached for the final, fortissimo high notes of Jana Gana Mana. Jason Roy closed his eyes during God Save The Queen, although that may have been the glare of the sun rather than the emotion of the moment. Joy had abandoned England of late; the team that scored runs for fun in the build-up to this World Cup had exchanged the emotion for an intensity that looked, in their game against Australia, as if it might pop a vein whenever they took a wicket. India, meanwhile, have resembled a family on a holiday they will talk about forever. Virat Kohli, whose eyes can emit forked fire, now finishes games against the West Indies with special Chris Gayle handshakes so cool they should come with a label warning not to try them at home. The same leader who once gave fans the finger is now a crowd whisperer, conducting their celebrations from the field like a musical director, reasoning with them like a trained arbitrator. He has even developed a perfect, Clooneyesque smile: bathed in nonchalance but never self-satisfied. Maybe England had observed all this \u2013 perhaps they had adopted a tactical happiness. Smile for the cameras. Fake it till you make it. If you\u2019re happy and you know it, tonk Yuzvendra Chahal into the Eric Hollies stand. The sun shone for them, too, although this was not Saturday\u2019s scorching heat. A muggy night, and the week of claustrophobic anxiety that had preceded it, had broken into a fresher dawn; and the day seemed to promise something new \u2013 even if it was just a pitch that finally favoured England\u2019s much-preferred batting style. In fact, for most of England\u2019s innings, the past 10 days \u2013 the losses to Sri Lanka and Australia, the slow motion implosion of a campaign four years in the making \u2013 seemed a fever dream. Here they were, Roy and Jonny Bairstow, opening the batting as if they had never been separated, lofting perfectly timed sixes as if all that had occurred after Roy\u2019s sudden departure belonged to a different team, a different story. It was obvious what had happened: England had stumbled into the darkest timeline. And Roy\u2019s long-awaited second coming had dragged them back to the original one. At the end of the first powerplay they had not lost a wicket, a feat they have managed only once previously this tournament, against West Indies. Even when innings did end \u2013 Morgan\u2019s in a short, sharp shock, Joe Root\u2019s in what was almost a mercy \u2013 the exhibition continued. Where in previous games the ball had cannoned high in the air \u2013 and back down to patient fielders \u2013 it now sailed through the sky in giant, comforting arcs. In the stands this was not a game about England at all. If their Trent Bridge game against Pakistan had given England a sense of being the visiting team, the Edgbaston effect made them look like a touring one. As part of the OneDay4Children campaign, the cricketeers encouraged visitors to wear Unicef colours and \u201cturn the ground blue!\u201d It was a redundant command: the ground was already blue, the blue of 20,000 Indian shirts. England fans blended quietly, invisibly, into the background. Only a solo trumpet rendition of Jerusalem \u2013 and a Ben Stokes six into their section of the Raglan stand \u2013 identified them. England wickets brought roars. Rohit fours brought more. As India chased \u2013 smoothly, stylishly \u2013 they rose to their feet for every boundary. India\u2019s confidence never left them, despite the large target. When they had left the field, needing 338, they had walked off slowly, smilingly, Chahal\u2019s arm wrapped around Ravi Jadeja\u2019s shoulders, Kuldeep Yadav clapping Jasprit Bumrah on the back. Out in the middle, the captain scored 50 and swapped his helmet for a cap. The target was large, but gettable. As the advertising boundary boards announced the imminent start of the Pro Kabaddi League in Mumbai, it was the England fans at home who were holding their breath, waiting for wickets they could not be sure would come. India\u2019s confidence never left them, until, incomprehensibly, it did. As they relaxed too far, and gave up the chase, England grasped their redemption narrative \u2013 even James Vince, as Roy\u2019s fielding substitute, caught Kohli and Hardik Pandya on the boundary, lightening the shadow of his own darkest timeline. Trajectories reasserted themselves; the path to the final realigned. As for the blank space on that trophy \u2013 perhaps Taylor could still have the last word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
