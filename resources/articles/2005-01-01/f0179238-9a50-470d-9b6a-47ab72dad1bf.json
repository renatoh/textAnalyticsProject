Principally, it is because he is still regarded as the scientist who changed physics for ever. The scale of his achievements can be seen in the names of those whose work Einstein completed or further developed: Riemann, Maxwell and Planck, to give just three. Each of Einstein's triple crown of mathematical physics papers published in 1905 - on the reality of atoms, the photoelectric effect, and on special relativity - remains central to the discipline. His later work, especially the general theory of relativity, made him even more important. But above the brilliance of his discoveries, it is the human details of Einstein's life that makes him so attractive. Working as a humble patent office clerk as he did much of his early research, his flight from anti-semitism in Germany as Hitler was coming to power entwines Einstein's life with the central events of the 20th century, including the development of the atom bomb. Yet if we remember Einstein for his successes, we should also remember him for his failures. Revolutionary in so many ways of thinking, Einstein doggedly insisted on the eternal, static nature of the universe, and coldly dismissed the possibility of the universe having begun with a \"big bang\". Yet he was not afraid to change his mind - despite being science's biggest pop star - or admit he was wrong when faced with Edwin Hubble's proof of an expanding universe. It is this that makes Einstein a perfect role model for science and scientists - which is how his anniversary is now being used in this country. Making 2005 an \"international year of physics\" is an attempt to inspire interest in \"big science\" and to arrest the decline in student numbers. It is important for potential Einsteins to know that even geniuses get it wrong from time to time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
