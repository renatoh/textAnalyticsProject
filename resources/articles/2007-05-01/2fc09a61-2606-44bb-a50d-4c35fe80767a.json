But ubiquity comes at a price, meaning that she has been taken for granted. He Never Mentioned Love, though, should change all that. Having covered a lot of ground on her previous albums without demonstrating a convincing emotional range, here she ticks that final box and becomes the complete jazz singer she's always threatened to be. Listen to her storytelling on 'LA Breakdown', the gentle ache of 'You're Nearer', or how she manoeuvres through 'Everything Must Change'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
