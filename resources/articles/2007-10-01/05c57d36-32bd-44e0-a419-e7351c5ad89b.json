Members could download music files but sharing movies was not allowed (Police shut down website after two-year music piracy inquiry, page 11, October 24). President John F Kennedy's inaugural address was in 1961, not 1964 as we said in the obituary of Joey Bishop, the comedian who performed the role of master of ceremonies at the event (page 35, October 24). The Mountain Lake hotel (of Dirty Dancing fame) is in Virginia, not Vermont as we said in A Dirty Weekend in Vermont, (theguardian.com, October 24). An art blog about Fragile State, an exhibition of Kosovan art (The art of a culture forged by war, theguardian.com, October 19) said that the curator of the exhibition, James Walmsley, also curated the Visions of Zimbabwe exhibition at Manchester Art Gallery. Visions of Zimbabwe was curated by Raphael Chikukwa; James Walmsley facilitated it. A graph was mislabelled, with the result that Northern Ireland was wrongly included as a country from which women travel to the UK for abortions. Northern Ireland is part of the UK. It should have been labelled: Women travelling to England and Wales for abortions, rather than women travelling to the UK (Statistics: abortion in figures, page 9, October 24). \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
