This huge golfing institution, presiding over one of the staples of the British sporting summer, felt compelled to react to a report claiming the 149th Open is set for cancellation. The missive from the office of Martin Slumbers didn\u2019t actually mention the c-word at all. \u201cWe are continuing to work through our options for the Open this year, including postponement,\u201d said the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive. \u201cDue to a range of external factors, that process is taking some time to resolve. We are well aware of the importance of being able to give clear guidance to fans, players and everyone involved and are working to resolve this as soon as we can. We will give a further update as soon as we are in a position to do so.\u201d Being kind, this could be labelled a holding statement. If \u201cexternal factors\u201d are key, one is left to ponder how much control the R&amp;A has of its golden goose. It was reported days earlier that postponement of the tournament, scheduled for Royal St George\u2019s in mid-July, was borderline inevitable. Forensic detective work was hardly required to deduce that much. The suggestion of cancellation, somewhat curiously, rattled Slumbers or those close to him sufficiently to deliver an example of words that say nothing at all. If the R&amp;A doesn\u2019t know precisely what to do about this year\u2019s Open, something is seriously amiss. Sport has been paralysed by coronavirus, with events and seasons dropping from billboards one by one. It is fanciful to suggest the Kent coast can \u2013 or should, in respect of public services \u2013 host 200,000 visitors and global competitors in a golf event in little over three months\u2019 time. The R&amp;A, for its many faults, cannot be ignorant over a pandemic. At the very least, if not providing a full explanation of contingency, the R&amp;A should have put a public line through Sandwich in its standard slot long before now; spectators alone deserve that much. Augusta National is still to issue detail of a 2020 Masters alternative but it was swift in postponing when coronavirus took hold. That the United States Golf Association hasn\u2019t ditched plans for the US Open in New York in June catapults golf into territory beyond Clubhouse Cuckoo Land. They and the R&amp;A set the rules for this game, you know. Which isn\u2019t, of course, to suggest complications don\u2019t exist. The R&amp;A is just glacial in dealing with them. In professional golf, not uniquely, key deliberations relate to a word starting with \u201cm\u201d and rhyming with honey. There has been speculation regarding the R&amp;A\u2019s insurance provision, say, which may ensure a fiscal gulf between cancellation or postponement. The new date window itself is small; September is realistically the latest month in which the Open could be held, with even that subject to daylight restrictions either curtailing the field or triggering two-tee starts. With every body in professional golf \u2013 the R&amp;A, USGA, PGA of America, Augusta National, PGA Tour and European Tour \u2013 fighting to play their tournaments, negotiations will be inevitably messy. Television companies, bereft of material yet heavy investors in golf, will have a seat at the table. Royal St George\u2019s will not readily give up their first Open since 2011. Nor will the local economy; it brings an estimated \u00a3100m worth of benefits. Yet the notion of just bumping Sandwich into 2021 is an uneasy one. St Andrews, Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon are already set in stone as venues for the three following years. The R&amp;A has a weird obsession with anniversaries; St Andrews was to stage the 150th playing of the Open, with 2023 marking 100 years since Troon\u2019s first one. The calendar can of course be shuffled around but it\u2019s messy, including in respect of Hoylake, where vast ticket sales send the R&amp;A\u2019s bean counters into a state of delirium. We assume that, by next weekend, overdue clarity will have been provided by the R&amp;A. The Open in July will bite the dust in slow, clunking, ultra-serious form. Twas ever thus. The solution will be far more interesting than the inevitable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
