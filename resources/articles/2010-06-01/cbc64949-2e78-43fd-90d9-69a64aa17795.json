Spain's secretary of state for Europe, Diego L\u00f3pez Garrido, had reminded everyone of Clegg's Spanish wife, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, and promised he would deliver his 20-minute speech in Spanish. The polyglot deputy prime minister started off in Spanish, fluently thanking the hosts of the event, before disappointing the crowd by saying he would actually make his speech in English. Trouble came later at question time. Sitting without earphones on \u2013 and so without access to the translators \u2013 he showed good comprehension but occasionally struggled to understand the precise wording of questions. Clegg himself admitted that his unrehearsed Spanish \u2013 despite the practice he gets on frequent trips to his wife's family home in Olmedo, Valladolid, north-west of Madrid \u2013 might not be perfect. \"This is the problem of trying to pretend you speak another language perfectly,\" he joked, as he asked for clarification on a question about whether Britain would one day join the euro. Clegg spoke in Spanish, however, with the prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, when the two men dined together on Thursday night. German There's no better way to flatter a German than to speak in his or her tongue.That's what the deputy prime minister had obviously been told \u2013 possibly by his German spokeswoman \u2013 ahead of his visit to Berlin this week . At a press briefing with his German counterpart, deputy chancellor Guido Westerwelle, he launched into a slightly accented but grammar-perfect statement that highlighted the \"refreshing\" feel of the \"famous Berlin air\". The foreign secretary, William Hague, who was standing to his right, looked on, slightly nonplussed, as his headphone translation had been turned off. Westerwelle appeared impressed, later remarking for the particular attention of the British press in the room (as if they, in the long tradition of poor British linguists, couldn't possibly speak German): \"I must say, his German is excellent.\" The remark in itself was a sign of how unusual it is for Anglo-Saxon politicians to speak German. Clegg is rare among members of British governments past and present in speaking German \u2013 or at least in having the courage to use it. He learnt his German as an exchange student in Munich at the age of 16, and later as a ski instructor in Austria. His parents are reported to have a house in the German-speaking luxury Swiss resort of Gstaad. Dutch Clegg speaks fluent Dutch, learnt at the knee of his mother, Hermance van den Wall Bake, who is from Holland and brought him up to be bilingual. He has regularly given interviews in the language to the Dutch media, which have given him more exposure in the Netherlands than he might otherwise have enjoyed. His fluency is so good that he appears on YouTube in a two-minute clip switching effortlessly between English and Dutch. This has excited xenophobic comments such as \"This will be proof for many that Nick Clegg is indeed a latte-sipping, windsurfing, arugula-munching Euro-snob\". Others are more charitable, saying \"How refreshing to have a leading British politician who can speak other languages\" and \"Good for you, Nick! I feel a great sense of pride that our deputy PM is so in touch with our neighbours\". In translation: The coalition agreement English - Spanish \"Money may be short, but that does not mean our ambition is small. We understand that there is so much more to government than simply spending money.\" \"Quiz\u00e1s haya poco dinero disponible, pero eso no quiere decir que estemos cortos de ambiciones. Nosotros creemos que gobernar es mucho mas que solamente gastar dinero\" English - Dutch \"We'll be positively engaged in the European Union, but we don't believe there should be further transfers of powers\". \"Wij zijn positief betrokken bij de EU maar we geloven niet in verdere overdracht van macht.\" English - German \"So this coalition will be different. We will be hard-nosed defenders of our security and our freedoms\". \"Diese Koalition wird anders sein. Wir werden knallharte Verteidiger unserer Sicherheit und unserer Freiheiten sein.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
