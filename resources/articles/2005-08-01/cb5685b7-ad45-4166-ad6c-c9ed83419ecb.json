First performed in 1857, it is one of the defining works of high Romanticism and constitutes the most probing musical analysis of Goethe's great drama. By abandoning chronological narrative in favour of a sequence of character studies, Liszt, more than any other composer, manages to encapsulate the play's psychological and metaphysical essence. Faust and Mephistopheles are presented as alter egos: tellingly, Mephistopheles, \"the spirit of negation\", is given no original material of his own. His music consists entirely of a demonic parody of Faust's relentlessly striving themes. As with many of Liszt's works, the performance requires a sense of risk and danger - qualities that Gianandrea Noseda, the BBC Philharmonic's principal conductor, usually possesses in spades. Here, however, he seemed unwilling to go to extremes, pulling back from exploring the outer limits of Faust's self-doubt and Mephistopheles' nihilism. Only the central Gretchen sequence, with its transition from innocence to barely expressed sexuality, was perfectly realised. That Noseda is turning Liszt-wards at a time when too few conductors are scheduling his music is admirable - but here, he seemed to be feeling his way into the score rather than giving the great interpretation of which he is capable. The symphony was prefaced by Brahms's Violin Concerto, with Nikolaj Znaider as soloist. This, too, didn't quite cohere as expected. The glamour of Znaider's playing was heard to best effect in the adagio. A lack of bite in the double-stopped passages of the opening movement, however, led to some undramatic stretches, for which Noseda tried to compensate by ratcheting up the tension when the orchestra was playing alone. The end result was far too wayward to be ideal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
