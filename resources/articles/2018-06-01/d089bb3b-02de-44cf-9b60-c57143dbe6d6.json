A Victorian parliamentary inquiry published its report on Tuesday into the state\u2019s plan to sell off nine Melbourne public estates to developers, the first stage of a long-term $185m strategy to renew ageing housing stocks. The report laid bare the crisis facing the state\u2019s social housing system, finding that a \u201ccontinuous under-investment in public housing\u201d had led to increasing unmet demand. The report revealed 82,499 Victorians were on the social housing waiting list, including 24,622 children, through 36,742 new applications and 7,286 applications for a transfer. The report found the priority waiting list had \u201cincreased significantly in recent years\u201d due to a loss of rental affordability, rapid population growth, family violence, disability, mental health and homelessness. At the same time, Victoria was rated as having the lowest proportion of social housing units per capita in the country. About 3.5% of occupied units in Victoria were classed as social housing, well below the national average of 4.5%. The number of social housing units as a proportion of all housing has fallen in Victoria in the past decade, the report said. The problem is exacerbated by the unsuitability of the existing social housing stock. About 80% of those on the waiting list required one or two-bedroom properties, but such buildings made up less than 60% of the total stock. The state government has faced some criticism over the first stage of its public housing renewal project, which will replace nine public housing estates with private-public mixed developments. The new developments will include a minimum of 10% extra public housing dwellings and hundreds of new private dwellings, but the plan has stalled in state parliament. The Council to Homeless Persons, Victoria\u2019s peak homelessness group, said the numbers contained in Tuesday\u2019s report should be a wake-up call to those opposing the government\u2019s renewal project. \u201cBehind the numbers are children who are waiting for a home, and families with their lives on hold,\u201d chief executive officer, Jenny Smith, said. \u201cA permanent, affordable home is a foundation for engaging in education, getting a job, having a stable life, and currently 82,000 Victorians are being denied that stability.\u201d Smith said the program would deliver 1,778 new public homes, compared with 617 if the land was kept solely for public housing. But the inquiry report identified a number of concerns about the plan. Critics say it is a lost opportunity to more significantly boost social housing stocks. The plan is being funded by the sale of public land and critics say the program will be the government\u2019s last chance to use the land for a major boost to social housing. The inquiry also raised concerns that existing tenants were promised an absolute right to return to the estates once they were rebuilt, but this was not reflected in the contracts they signed. \u201cIt appears that the airing of this issue at this Inquiry caused the paperwork to be changed \u2013 including what will be a retrospective change for at least 110 tenants who had already signed the original agreement and left their homes,\u201d inquiry chairwoman Margaret Fitzherbert said. \u201cThis intervention should not have been necessary.\u201d The state\u2019s housing minister, Martin Foley, urged the Coalition and the Greens to \u201cstop playing politics\u201d and let the government push ahead with its renewal plan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
