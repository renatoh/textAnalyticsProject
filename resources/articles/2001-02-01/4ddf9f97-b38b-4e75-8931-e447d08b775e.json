Third-placed Rangers are now nine points behind their great rivals, the Turk Tugay Kerimoglu scoring the winner for the understrength champions after 34 minutes on a raw night in Glasgow. Rangers, though, made hard work of victory and both teams finished with 10 men, Neil McCann of Rangers and Aberdeen's Phil McGuire dismissed for each receiving two yellow cards in the second half. In a quiet first half Bert Konterman, filling in a holding role in midfield for Rangers, tried an early shot from long range but it ended up as far away from goal as when it had arrived at the Dutchman's feet. Thomas Solberg set the tone for the evening when he was booked for a body-check on McCann as the winger went past him down the line on the left. Derek Whyte was then penalised for bringing down Tore Andre Flo when beaten by a turn and when Tugay fired the free-kick against the wall it looked like the danger was gone. But Tugay was first to the loose ball and fired a low shot past Dave Preece's outstretched right arm and into the net. It was the game's first shot on target. The pressure was off the home side and Kenny Miller forced Preece into a save before Flo blasted over from a similar distance. Kevin McNaughton had to hack over his own bar under pressure from Flo but Preece punched away. It was a bad-tempered night and Rangers will have to improve to match Celtic step for step. \u0095 Sky's pay-per-view Scottish Premier League venture last night got off to the worst possible start when St Johnstone's home game against the leaders Celtic was called off because of fog 15 minutes before the scheduled kick off. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
