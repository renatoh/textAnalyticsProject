Vogel has been troubled by a thigh injury sustained in last week's 2-0 friendly defeat by Germany and missed Sun day's 1-0 win over Liechtenstein. Vogel said: \"I have felt a very clear improvement and I do not see any reason why I will not be ready for Sunday.\" Vladimir Smicer and Milan Baros, team-mates at Liverpool, will be competing for the right to partner Jan Koller up front for the Czech Republic. The assistant coach Josef Csaplar said: \"Koller is Koller and he will play for sure. That means when we play with two forwards, there will be a question about whether it will be Smicer or Baros.\" The Portugal defender Beto has recovered from a pulled leg muscle and resumed training yesterday. Beto was the hosts' only injury doubt ahead of Saturday's opening match with Greece. Italy's coach Giovanni Trapattoni said he has no problems with the midfielder Gennaro Gattuso's criticism and that team spirit was high. \"It is human and right that he shows his ambition and that he wants to play,\" Trapattoni said of the Milan player's outburst on Tuesday at being marginalised. He is not expected to start against Denmark on Monday. The tactical debate in Sweden has been joined by the country's prime minister Goran Persson who is having an enforced break from politics after a hip operation. He wants Sweden to be more adventurous. \"Let [Freddie] Ljungberg play forward behind Henke [Henrik Larsson] and Zlatan [Ibrahimovic],\" he told the Swedish daily Aftonbladet. Arjen Robben resumed full training with the Holland squad yesterday and will be fit for Tuesday's Group D game against Germany. His chances of making the team have increased because the coach Dick Advocaat is planning to switch from 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3 system with two wingers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
