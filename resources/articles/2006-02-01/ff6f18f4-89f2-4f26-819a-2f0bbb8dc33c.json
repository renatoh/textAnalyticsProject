Seven years after British Steel merged with Dutch firm Hoogovens and renamed itself Corus, new management, under French chief executive Philippe Varin, appears to be considering another corporate makeover, of some shape or form, and has asked Peter to advise. Peter is best known for his 1980s manual The Sloane Ranger's Handbook, though he remains a prolific writer, most recently publishing Dictators' Homes, perhaps the seminal work on interior design choices of history's naughtiest tyrants. Quite how face powder-wearing Peter will fare in the industrial heartlands in which Corus still operates (despite shedding almost 13,000 UK jobs since its last corporate makeover) we can't imagine. We wish him the best of luck. The Radisson hotel group, we are sorry to learn, is having trouble winning the affections of the denizens of Birmingham, despite last month opening one of its first class flophouses within the city's new tallest building, Beetham Tower. Launching an accompanying publicity campaign, billboards proudly featured other iconic images from the Birmingham skyline, including Selfridges, the city's famous Rotunda and the BT Tower. Sadly, the campaign faltered after locals gently pointed out that the BT Tower featured was more famed for gracing the London skyline. Oops. While the City Diary eagerly awaits the day novelty ringtones lose their appeal, we recognise that is not likely to occur any time soon. Latest seeking to cash in on the craze, as reported elsewhere on these pages, is BBC Worldwide. Among the ringtones the corporation's commercial arm has put up for sale, at 75p a shot, is the \"Exterminate!\" battle cry of a Dalek. Meanwhile, the excellent BBC website accompanying the latest series of the show is giving away the \"Exterminate!\" download for free."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
