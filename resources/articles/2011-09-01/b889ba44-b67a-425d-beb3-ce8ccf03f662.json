David Becker, former general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had financial ties with Madoff through an account he inherited with his brothers after his mother died. Irving Picard, the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy of Madoff's investment empire, has sued the Beckers, seeking to recover about $1.5m in gains they received before the account was closed. Becker's link to Madoff was questioned by politicians earlier this year who called on the SEC to clarify any potential conflicts of interest. His work at the SEC included advising on compensation for Madoff's victims. Becker's ties to Madoff were not revealed publicly until February this year, shortly after his resignation from the SEC. The referral to the justice department, first reported by the New York Times, follows an investigation by David Kotz, the inspector general of the SEC. The report will be discussed on Thursday at the House financial services committee and the committee on oversight and government reform, where Kotz, Becker and Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the SEC, are expected to testify. According to the New York Times, the report says Becker was treated differently from other employees who had ties to the Madoff family, and that he was allowed to advise on the commission's recommendations related to the Madoff case despite his own financial interest. The report also suggests the SEC chose not to have Becker testify before a Washington committee because he wanted to disclose his Madoff ties. According to the report, an SEC staff member told Schapiro that Becker wanted to make the disclosure and the pair then decided someone other than Becker should speak at the hearing. \"The decision that Becker would not serve as a witness was made in large part because he would have disclosed the fact that his mother had held a Madoff account,\" the report concludes. The report also claims that Becker pushed \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to limit Picard's ability to recover funds from investors such as himself. In a statement earlier this year the SEC said Becker \"sought advice from the ethics office, and was advised that the liquidated account was not a basis for disqualification from participation in certain Madoff-related matters\". The SEC has come under intense criticism following the Madoff scandal. Becker clashed with Harry Markopolos, the whistleblower who first alerted the SEC to Madoff's fraud. According to Markopolos, Becker reacted badly to his account of the Madoff fraud. \"Maybe he simply was insulted that I had called his agency incompetent ... but whatever the reason, he was furious,\" Markopolos wrote in his book No one Would Listen. In interviews Madoff, now serving a 150-year jail sentence, has said he was amazed the SEC did not see through his scheme. He told investigators he had \"too much credibility with them and they dismissed\" suggestions he was running a Ponzi scheme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
