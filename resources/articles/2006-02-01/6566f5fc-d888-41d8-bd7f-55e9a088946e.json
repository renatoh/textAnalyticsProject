Thursday's byelection in Dunfermline and West Fife was the worst of the lot for Labour, not just because they lost it, and by some measure the best of all for the Liberal Democrats, not solely because Willie Rennie won a famous victory. An analysis that concentrates only on these steady post-2005 trends of Labour lost votes and Lib Dem growth, important though they are, hardly does justice to one of the most dramatic and counter-intuitive third party byelection triumphs of the modern era. If media coverage was as decisive as party strategists always say, then the Lib Dems would have been massacred on Thursday in the wake of the Charles Kennedy, Mark Oaten and Simon Hughes debacles. Instead, not only have the Lib Dems not been massacred, but Mr Rennie has pulled off one of the biggest byelection coups in a four-party contest in years. How did this happen? Labour campaign missteps are obviously part of the answer. Labour support has been very vulnerable in every byelection in a Labour-held seat since the Iraq war. But in Hodge Hill, Hartlepool and Livingston, Labour nevertheless managed to hang on. In Brent East, Leicester South and now Dunfermline and West Fife, on the other hand, their grip was prised open. Local issues like the rise in Forth Road Bridge tolls and the announcement at the start of the campaign of a large Lexmark factory closure in Rosyth obviously played an important part. Squabbles between Labour's rival power brokers in Westminster and Edinburgh clearly made things worse. In the end, though, the key ingredient was not just Labour's weakness but a credible challenge from a candidate who could unite the tactical vote and attract former Labour supporters in a low poll. Though he left it so late in the day that very few on either side saw it coming, Mr Rennie managed to stake an uncontestable claim as the anti-Labour candidate most likely to succeed. If the Scottish Nationalists had been more able to make such a claim, the likelihood is that, as in Livingston last September, they would have given Labour a very nasty fright but would not have created the momentum to win a famous victory. The byelection win is manna from heaven for the good-news-starved LibDems. It also reflects well on the efforts of the acting leader Sir Menzies Campbell, the party's leading presence in Fife, and it may help him in his difficult battle to succeed Mr Kennedy. Perhaps the most clear-cut conclusion from Mr Rennie's win is simply that there will now be one more vote against the government in tight votes in the Westminster lobbies. Whether his win can be read as proof that the party's general standing has been understated in post-Kennedy opinion polls is more doubtful - but at least it is arguable now, not merely fanciful, that the LibDems may replace the SNP as principal challengers to Labour in Scotland over the next decade. Thursday's result was bad news not just for the SNP but also for the Conservatives, both of whom had hoped to emerge from the Scottish doldrums. Given the tactical voting, the complete absence of a David Cameron effect is not wholly surprising in a seat where the Tories have now finished fourth four times in a row; its absence is nevertheless a Tory disappointment worth noting. But there is no disputing that the big loser is Labour. Officials stressed local factors for the defeat yesterday, but a more general vulnerability, even in Scotland, is now unmistakeable. The glory days are over, whether the party is led by Tony Blair or by Gordon Brown. Every byelection in a Labour seat is now a potential loss. Labour's road back to the land of electoral plenty looks set to be a long one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
