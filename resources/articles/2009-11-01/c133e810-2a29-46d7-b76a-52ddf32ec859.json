Please bear in mind when commenting that other readers may not have seen the entire series. Girl, you'll be a woman soon\u2026 The lightning five are helping out at an OAP tea-dance this week while still trying to come to grips with their powers, and the murder of their probation worker. Well, all except Nathan, who's pretty unhappy about being left out of the power trip: \"You're all special and I'm not?\" In the locker room, Curtis finds the first of several worrying notes, saying \"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID\" \u2013 uh-oh, has Psychoville's blackmailer run loose and hopped channels? Who's curious about our orange gang? And why do blackmailers always use cut-out letters? Simon keeps himself busy this week, chatting online to the mysterious Shygirl18 and slowly exploring his powers in a creepy scene where he tests out his invisibility by watching Kelly and Alisha getting changed. He seems to be the only one who's starting to enjoy his power \u2013 although that's not altogether surprising, since Kelly keeps hearing things she doesn't really want to, and Alisha has some more full-on encounters. First it's one of the old men at the tea-dance who has to be eased away from her, and then it's the policeman in charge of her curfew (Nicholas Burns - who played The Hotness in No Heroes). Her \"power\" (turning men into porn-chatting would-be rapists as soon as they touch her) is one of the few real off notes in the series so far, and it'll be interesting to see where the writers are going with it. Nathan's the main focus of this week's episode. His mum won't let him come back home, so he's kipping in the community centre \u2013 and trying to work out why he keeps seeing her boyfriend Jeremy running \"naked like a wolfboy\" through the streets at night. It's not all doom and confusing gloom, however, as he gets to meet Ruth, an attractive volunteer working with the OAPs, their little midnight drugs-and-boozy-snogging session only interrupted by Jeremy's naked running through the streets. It all leads to some pretty NSFW scenes \u2013 especially if you're watching on 4OD \u2013 including probably the only seduction on E4 to involve a glass of sherry. And ends up with Nathan pegging it out of Ruth's house in a dressing gown when she transforms - mid shag - back into an 82 year old. So are we getting closer to discovering Nathan's power? Last week we mentioned the wolf following him in the opening credits where you get to see graphic representations of everyone else's powers \u2013 Simon's invisibility, Kelly's mind-reading, Curtis's shadow running backwards away from him. The wolf might just be Jeremy, who's certainly around a lot in this episode. But it's starting to feel more like Nathan's the boy who cried wolf: someone who lies on autopilot as a kind of defence mechanism, and is now, thanks to the lightning, having to deal with the consequences. When he first meets Ruth, he jokes that he's doing community service because he \"sexually assaulted a 90-year-old woman\". Is his brief encounter with her \u2013 a woman who's really in her 80s \u2013 a weird way of this coming true? Nathan also mentions something about being \"done for eating some pick and mix\" \u2013 didn't he say that last week, too? Got a feeling that might turn out to somehow be the truth. Misfit thoughts \u2022 Who is Shygirl18 who's been popping up on Simon's Facebook page? \u2022 Is the new probation officer the person who's been sending them the notes in their lockers? There aren't many more candidates really, and that shot of her in the final scene just stopped short of a big evil genius \"mwah-ha-ha\" \u2026 \u2022 Great little detail to see Simon dancing like Ian Curtis and Kelly throwing shapes in the background during the tea-dance to James Blunt, before Nathan pegs it when old Ruth walks up to him - and then to have Joy Division's Atmosphere playing as Nathan decides to go back to Ruth's house. \u2022 Where's Nathan going to live now? The week's best lines \"You can get a gun off the internet.\" Simon knows his way around Google. \"George Michael gets away with this shit, but he used to be in Wham! - who are you?\" Nathan's not impressed with Jeremy's midnight rambling. Old man sitting in a chair: (Thinks) \"My mouth's as dry as a badger's chuff.\" \"Want a cup of tea?\" Kelly puts her powers to good use at the community centre. \"I will not be in a room where that song is playing. Line in the sand, my friend.\" James Blunt's You're Beautiful will not be found on Nathan's iPod then. \"If you ever hurt her, I'll take you up the vets and have you put down.\" Nathan's parting shot to Jeremy. Nathan: \"I shagged someone's gran?!\" Ruth: \"I haven't got any grandchildren.\" Next time Kelly butts heads, Simon starts playing with his invisiblility, Alisha goes clubbing and is Tony still alive?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
