Not that Santamaria was self-consciously rootsy. But he seemed to make music as he had grown up with it, and as he had adapted his origins in his adopted US homeland. The latter evolution was clear in his biggest hit, the infectiously repetitious Herbie Hancock soul-jazz anthem, Watermelon Man. Making that song famous, and writing one that became almost as frequently played - the supple, elegant Afro-Blue - secured his reputation from the 1960s on. He was born Ramon Santamaria in a poor district of Havana. A violinist at first, he switched to drums in his teens. Two strikingly different approaches to dance music were then turning musical habits in the Cuban capital upside down, with innovations in the elegant violin and flute music of the danzon orchestras, and the effervescent, brass-led sounds of the conjuntos, with their driving conga drummers and blasting two-trumpet front lines. Santamaria worked at Havana's celebrated Tropicana Club with Conjunto Matamoros and Conjunto Azul before visiting Mexico with a dance ensemble. He headed on to New York, arriving there in 1950 and beginning to work in the flutes-and- violin style ( charanga ) of Gilberto Valdes, subsequently joining the popular bands of Perez Prado and Tito Puente, with whom he stayed for six years. Dizzy Gillespie had spotted new possibilities in the conjunction of American jazz and west African-rooted Cuban rhythms, featuring Latin themes and Cuban percussionists in his bands of the 1940s. Through the next decade, these relationships became popular with players and public alike. In 1957, Santamaria went to San Francisco to join the vibraphone player and occasional drummer Cal Tjader, who was investigating fusions of Latin music, soul, proto-funk and jazz. This smoothly-grooving and funky sound took off with such albums as Mas Caliente, and Santamaria soon began to navigate his own path in it. He started recording as a leader, first exploring the west African spiritual origins of Cuban music on 1958's Yambu, then took a jazzier and more westernised direction with the follow-up, Mongo, which featured Afro Blue. His boldness of conception showed in his lineups, at first fusing the Latin charanga flute/violin instrumentation with jazz brass and reeds, with the latter eventually becoming dominant in his sound. Two years after he returned to New York in 1962, there were significant commercial hits, with Watermelon Man and pianist Rodgers Grant's Yeh-Yeh (also a success for Georgie Fame). Watermelon Man emerged from a New York night on which Hancock, then a little-known deputising pianist, sat in with the band - and the conjunction resulted in an originally unintended Latin groove for his composition. Santamaria, now committed to a jazzy brass-and-saxes lineup, recorded the track for the Riverside label, and the single made the top 10 of the pop charts. That success made an accessible fusion of Cuban rhythms, soul, r&amp;b and funk very popular in the 1960s. Santamaria made 10 albums for Columbia in the style, employed such highly regarded younger musicians as saxophonists Pat Patrick and Sonny Fortune, and pianist Chick Corea. His eminence as the bandleader who did much to creatively splice Cuban and black American musical ideas, and broaden the technical and imaginative scope of drummers and percussionists, brought him a busy schedule into the 1990s, with late-period albums like Mongo Returns and Brazilian Sunset sustaining a remarkable freshness. He also appeared in the films Our Latin Thing (1972) and Salsa (1976), recorded with Dizzy Gillespie in 1980 and appeared on television specials. He was widely regarded as a crucial bridge between the Latin-jazz sound of the 1960s and the salsa movement. Santamaria is survived by six children. \u00b7 Ramon 'Mongo' Santamaria, percussionist, born April 7 1922; died February 1 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
