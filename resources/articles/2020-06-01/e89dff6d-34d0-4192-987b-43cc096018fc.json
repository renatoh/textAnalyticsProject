Toby Alderweireld could not believe his ears when he heard several hundred local residents had signed a petition to erect a memorial to him in place of that to the former king of Belgium Leopold II, who oversaw atrocities in Congo from the late 1880s to 1908. The defacement and subsequent removal of Leopold\u2019s likeness, which was targeted during the wave of protests following George Floyd\u2019s killing in the United States, has left a vacancy where it stood in the town centre. \u201cI was laughing,\u201d Alderweireld says of his reaction to the idea, which had gained more than 800 signatures by Friday afternoon. \u201cI thought it was some kind of joke, that people are actually signing the petition. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m a little bit honoured as well. It\u2019s a small town in Belgium and until I was 15 I spent my youth there. I went to school there and I still go back. If they really wanted to I would never say no because I would be honoured, but I will not sign my own petition. Of all the people who have, I think about 80% are my friends.\u201d Tottenham supporters may be persuaded to join the cause if, upon the return of Premier League football on Wednesday, Alderweireld can help salvage a season that looked doomed when the music stopped. It has been a fall from grace for Spurs, who are yet to see much benefit from the decision to replace Mauricio Pochettino with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. They are out of the Champions League and seven points off the top four, although fifth place will secure a return to the top table if Manchester City lose their battle with Uefa at the court of arbitration for sport. That spot is occupied by Manchester United, who visit White Hart Lane on Friday for a match whose significance cuts through the sterile environment that will host it. \u201cI know it\u2019s a cliche but it\u2019s nine games and we have to see it as nine finals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to get good momentum and the first is a very big game. We are going to do everything we can to reach the top four.\u201d The list of players who have not hit top form, Alderweireld included, is sizable. But Harry Kane\u2019s hamstring injury, which sidelined him after New Year\u2019s Day, counts as a form of force majeure and there was encouragement when the England captain said he felt \u201cas good as I can be\u201d last month. \u201cIn training he looks fully fit, top fit, so we\u2019re going to see the old Kane again,\u201d Alderweireld says. \u201cHe has been out for a longer period so his desire to show everyone is unbelievable, so you\u2019re going to see a very good Kane.\u201d There has been scant letup in Kane\u2019s rehabilitation process but Alderweireld is at pains to stress nobody has had much of a break. Three months without football are not quite what they seem: uncertainty around the league\u2019s return meant nobody could switch off and whether through Zoom sessions or individual runs around Trent Park while being tracked via GPS he believes he kept fitter than on a typical pre-season before training recommenced. \u201cEveryone went into \u2018beast mode\u2019 \u2013 training, training,\u201d he says of those blank days in March and April. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know when we were going back. Maybe the week after, two weeks after. So people think we were on holiday but we sure weren\u2019t. \u201cWhen we were back training we felt like: \u2018I\u2019m ready,\u2019 not like in pre-season when it\u2019s: \u2018Oh, I have to start all over again, I feel muscle pain.\u201d He thinks that, with 2020-21 likely to follow in short order and a postponed Euro 2020 to come straight afterwards, \u201csome kind of mental break\u201d will be needed after July. There has been plenty else to occupy the mind. Alderweireld became a father for the second time three months ago so, in one sense, lockdown has been opportune. Life outside the footballing bubble now takes on a brighter hue. \u201cPeople say: \u2018What\u2019s going to be after football? Are you going to be in some black hole?\u2019 But I know from this experience how much I\u2019m going to enjoy being with my family and having a normal experience with them.\u201d In March, Alderweireld and his father paid for tablets and phones to be used by isolated residents of hospitals and care homes in England and Belgium. The idea was that families could maintain a visual connection regardless of Covid\u201119 and there were some intensely bittersweet results. \u201cThere were even stories about people who had to say goodbye to family members who died with a video call,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s strange but if the tablet wasn\u2019t there you couldn\u2019t say goodbye at all.\u201d It was a meaningful way to assuage a terrible effect of lockdown and he applies similarly deep consideration to the issue of statues and recognising history, regardless of who eventually ends up on that plinth in Ekeren. \u201cI would never say: \u2018This is a good time to put up a statue of me,\u2019 because I don\u2019t think I will ever deserve a statue,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good to take down the statue and I\u2019m not going to get involved in that, but I do think it\u2019s good to look back at the history and learn from it. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with the history from the world wars. Of course I\u2019m disgusted about all the things that have involved racism and I will never understand it, but taking a statue down? All I will say is that we have to look to that period and look at what went wrong so we never get in that situation again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
