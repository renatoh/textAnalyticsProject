Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Thomas Wolfe told us that you can never go home again. But you can do some re-reading, as Diane Cano explains: Re-reading in my ninth decade a book I first read as an adolescent: Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe. Even as an adolescent I thought of it as a novel especially suited for young teenagers, full of enthusiasm and new pain. It is still racist and misogynist and full of (glorious) lists, but I am no longer the indignant girl I was. Now I just relax into the tolerance of knowing, with Auden, that Time \u201cworships language and forgives everyone by whom it lives\u201d. Oh, how Wolfe throws those words up, around, over and through - everything. \u201cI am not sure why,\u201d says gavernism, \u201cbut I am re reading The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Stevenson\u201d: Perhaps because I feel that social media today plays the role that chemicals play in that novel: it opens up a dark side of us that can roam around in the dark, anonymously, doing as it pleases. The issue now, as with the novel, is that hidden never really stays hidden, does it? The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan is \u201coutstanding\u201d according to darrylxxx: So many interesting stories, connections, insights and so easy to relate to where we are now as a global population. Shows how things ebb and flow over time \u2013 our current \u201creality\u201d isn\u2019t fixed in stone. \u201cI do love Home Front diaries,\u201d says NicolaVintageReads, who has been reading May Smith\u2019s wartime diary These Wonderful Rumours: Ration books, Time and Tide magazine, sitting in a cold cellar waiting for the all-clear siren, tennis parties, wartime wedding cakes with cardboard imitation icing, seeing the newly released Disney films Dumbo and Pinocchio at the cinema, billeting evacuees, fear or Goering\u2019s plans but spirit of the Blitz. WebberExpat is also \u201cloving\u201d Lucia Berlin\u2019s A Manual For Cleaning Women: A bitterly hilarious, brutally truthful, elegantly incisive collection. Wonderful, just a brilliant, up-front, trusthworthy voice. One which does not overstay its welcome, nor get too repetitive meandering between stories. Meanwhile, BobHammond2 loves Phillip Roth\u2019s alternate history novel The Plot Against America: The sense of growing unease is palpable. I like the way Roth explores events \u2013 mainly a growing wave of anti-semitism in an isolationist America in WW2 governed by a right wing president \u2013 through the experience of a really well-defined young Jewish boy and his family. Becoming by Michelle Obama has impressed nicegirl2: I\u2019m not really one for reading non-fiction but this is brilliant \u2013 so well written, smart, funny and humble (so far). Visions of Gerard by Jack Kerouac haunts dylan37: A childhood in the 1920s, a saintly hero brother who disappears too soon, Catholic dreams in a Massachusetts winter, survivor guilt and a family struggling with mourning. There\u2019s a different kind of Kerouac energy here; introspective, spiritual, angelic and natural. The ghosts of the great wanderers float through these words \u2013 William Blake and Walt Whitman, with the touch and feel of sad autumn leaves. There\u2019s that strange melancholy of a dying season, disappearing like smoke from a slow burn bonfire. A haunting and beautiful small book, about the biggest of subjects. Red Bones by Ann Cleeves has intrigued jimitron5000: There is a certain slow burning intrigue about this book. The location adds an immense amount to the story and covers for the times when not much happens. It develops nicely into a really enjoyable novel. I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show. Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzis\u0142aw Najder\u2019s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar: Pursuing Joseph Conrad\u2019s beginnings as a writer, I came across this: In March 1893 the Torrens, \u201cone of the most famous sailing ships of its day\u201d, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship\u2019s Polish mate: \u201cA capital chap, though queer to look at; he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts\u2026\u201d John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction. Amazing! Interesting links about books and reading From Tel Aviv with love: Leonard Cohen\u2019s letters to Marianne have just been sold at auction. The \u201cstrange story\u201d of a secretive award funded by the chairman of Barnes &amp; Noble. James Campbell on John Fowles\u2019 French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman at 50. A literal (cartoon) rendering of David Berman\u2019s poetry. Paul Ewen in solidarity with the illegally detained writer Behrouz Boochani.
