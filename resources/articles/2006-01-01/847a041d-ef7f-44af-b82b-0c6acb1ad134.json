In fact next Wednesday the two men are going head-to-head (at a Media Society event) in a kind of TV news equivalent of a wrestling slamdown. It should be good spectator sport. Both teams will be preparing their ammunition for the debate: who was first on which breaking news story and who got what wrong and for how long. Earlier this month of course everyone got it wrong about the tragic unfolding story of the mine rescue in West Virginia (including the Today Programme). This morning came one of those classic events which play perfectly into the hands of rolling news - the injured bottle nose whale that swam up the Thames as far as Chelsea. PA first reported the story at 11.18am and the clear victor on speed was Sky News, which started running live helicopter pictures of the whale near Tower Bridge at around 12.31pm. According to the network the BBC had their first live pictures an hour later. Both channels were immediately on the phone to their marine and zoology pundits and even Sky Sports' fishing expert was called into service. Around 2pm, Sky reported a second whale sighting in Southend-on-Sea and it was also first with the money shot - a concerned bystander shooing the poor creature away from the shallows. As the spectacle unfolded, the Boat Race atmosphere gave way to concern as it became clear that the whale was injured and bleeding. By about 3pm, the tide was beginning to turn and the creature disappeared from view and the BBC went back to normal service while Sky stuck with it. The BBC was first with the now obligatory viewers' mobile-phone pictures and they also invited viewers to name-that-whale. OK this wasn't \"Shock and Awe\" or the Blunkett resignation but thousands of spectators were drawn to the banks of the Thames and I suspect many more were glued to their TV sets. This is certainly the biggest rolling news event of the year so far. Last week, Paul Mason writing in the MediaGuardian said rolling news had the most to lose from the emerging on-demand media such as broadband TV and video clips on 3G mobiles. But the one thing they can't replicate at the moment is the live streaming that rolling news can give us when pop stars go on trial or bottle nose whales lose their way. \u00b7 Chris Shaw is senior programme controller, news and current affairs, at Channel Five. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
