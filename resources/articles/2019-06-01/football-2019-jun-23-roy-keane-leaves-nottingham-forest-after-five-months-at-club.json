Keane has been working as O\u2019Neill\u2019s assistant since January but the former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland captain has always made it clear his preference would be to start again in management, eight and a half years since his last position at Ipswich Town. His departure from the City Ground has been described as amicable and he will now start the process of trying to find a way back into the game. Keane, who has previously managed Sunderland and started his playing career at Forest, also worked with O\u2019Neill for the Republic of Ireland but believes it is time to return to management in his own right. Keane said: \u201cWorking with Martin over the last few years has been a magnificent experience, one of my greatest in football both as a player and a coach and one I want to personally thank him for.\u201d A statement released by Forest said: \u201cRoy would like to express his gratitude to the club\u2019s owner, board of directors, the staff, the players and, in particular, manager Martin O\u2019Neill for the opportunity to return to the City Ground. \u201cThe former Red would also like to place on record his appreciation to the supporters who have welcomed him back so warmly since his appointment in January. Everyone at the club would like to wish Roy the very best in the next stage of his career.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
