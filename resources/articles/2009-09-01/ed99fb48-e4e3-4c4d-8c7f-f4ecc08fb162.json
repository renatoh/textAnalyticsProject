On the morning of Thursday 11 October 1990, the racing career of Lester Piggott was locked away in the history books: Britain's most inscrutably taciturn sporting icon; first winner as a cherubic 12-year-old in 1948; champion jockey 11 times; winner of more than 4,000 races in Britain plus countless others around the world; the legend who had retired five years earlier to start training; a fresh career brought to a shuddering halt by a year in prison for tax fraud. Then that Thursday afternoon came word that Piggott, who would turn 55 the following month, was returning to the saddle. He had last ridden in Britain in October 1985, and after a farewell tour around the globe arrived back in England to start training at Eve Lodge in Newmarket. Never one to take the obvious route when an unorthodox alternative was available, Piggott briefly flirted with a rapid comeback in the spring of 1986 after Vincent O'Brien, the Irish trainer for whom he had ridden so many big-race winners, including Sir Ivor and Nijinsky, asked him to ride Tate Gallery in the 2,000 Guineas. Piggott agreed, but then came the hitch. \"When this news was reported in the press,\" he recalled, \"my phone instantly became red hot with indignant calls from people who had produced 'Lester Piggott Retirement' memorabilia the previous autumn. They threatened all sorts of dire consequences if I broke those contracts by returning to the saddle, so I dropped the idea.\" He sent out a Royal Ascot winner in his first season as a trainer, but the wheels started to come off his new career when it emerged that he was being investigated for tax fraud, and after pleading guilty at his trial in October 1987 he was sentenced to three years. Released on parole in October 1988 after a year and a day inside, he summed up the experience as a \"massive waste of time with absolutely nothing to show for it at the end\". Having ruled out a return to training \u2013 his wife, Susan, now held the licence at Eve Lodge \u2013 he effectively disappeared from the racing radar, though kept himself fit by riding out regularly, and easily shed the weight put on during his time inside. Early in 1990 the name Lester Piggott appeared in a racecard for the first time in more than four years when, all but unnoticed by the British press, he rode at a meeting in Peru, and in July 1990 veterans' charity races in Ireland further rekindled his enthusiasm. It was O'Brien \u2013 for whom Piggott had been doing riding work as part of his preparation for the races \u2013 who sowed the seed of an improbable idea when asking, \"Why don't you make a comeback?\", although initially the jockey did not entertain the idea seriously. Over lunch in a private room at a Dublin hotel, O'Brien became more insistent: his retained jockey for 1990 was John Reid, but he promised Piggott first choice of rides in 1991. This time the former champion gave the notion deeper thought, but, as he relates in his autobiography: \"My own view was only one side of the equation, and the other side was less easy to predict: would I get enough rides to make the comeback worthwhile, and would I be taken seriously? I was only interested in a return to the saddle if I could achieve it at the highest level.\" He decided to go ahead, was passed fit by the Jockey Club doctor, and then had to face the Club's Licensing Committee. The story goes that when Piggott discovered that the committee was chaired by Lord Vestey, whose family firm, Dewhurst, had had its own brushes with the Inland Revenue over the years, he remarked: \"That's all right. He doesn't like paying his taxes either.\" The Second Coming began on 15 October 1990 at Leicester. This was in a different media age, well before the existence of dedicated racing channels and high-tech communications machines within the sport's governing body, and initially the press had been wrong-footed by a sensational return kept under wraps until the last minute. Now journalists descended on Leicester, where they discovered the new Piggott to be every bit as sardonic as the old. Asked whether his riding technique had changed in his time away, he replied: \"No, still one leg each side.\" Like Fallon, Piggott finished runner-up on his first ride back, and it was only by inches that Lupescu failed to effect the perfect return. Two more losers followed that afternoon, but he had only to wait until the next day at Chepstow for his return to the winner's enclosure on Nicholas, trained by his wife \u2013 and for good measure he won the next race. The second week back brought perhaps the greatest Piggott moment of all. With Reid sidelined through injury, O'Brien engaged Piggott to ride Royal Academy in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park, New York, and only 12 days after the Leicester return, the jockey produced the most exquisite ride of his life to bring the colt up with a sweeping run on the outside and win by a neck. It is because of his long association with O'Brien, and not because this was the most valuable single prize he won, that Piggott calls Royal Academy \"the most satisfying winner I ever rode\". Two years later \u2013 by which time he had landed his 30th English Classic when Rodrigo de Triano won the 2,000 Guineas \u2013 the Breeders' Cup meeting at Gulfstream Park, Florida, provided the worst moment of the comeback when Piggott sustained serious injuries through the fall of Mr Brooks, breaking several bones. But he shrugged off the damage, assuring his friend Peter O'Sullevan: \"I've had worse injuries falling out of bed.\" Piggott carried on race-riding in Britain until 1994, but the flow of rides was slowing down, and he decided not to renew his licence the following year. This time there was no farewell tour, nor a fresh issue of commemorative merchandise. A simple announcement in September 1995 signalled the end of the most remarkable career in racing history. Or did it? Piggott is now 73, and even by his standards a third riding career would appear about as likely as the return of Elvis. On the other hand, with Lester Piggott, anything remains possible.
