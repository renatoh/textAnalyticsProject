Much to my dismay, the retail machine that arrived this evening, when plugged in and ready to go, threw the error message which has been plaguing many of the Xbox 360 consumers in North America over the past 10 days. While my machine hadn't even had the chance to overheat (with its enormous controller - believe the hype) and many of these messages appear in the middle of a heavy gaming session, the E74 message came on when I turned the thing on for the first time. Woe woe woe. I took a snap for proof. After searching around on the various forums filled with a distressing gaggle of dismayed consumers, I unplugged the machine's power supply and stuck in the review machine's power supply. Voila! The retail machine booted and is now on target. So perhaps the problem isn't with the Xbox 360 hardware, but with the power supply instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
