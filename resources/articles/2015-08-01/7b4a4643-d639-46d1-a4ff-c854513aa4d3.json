The charges, in which Manning is accused of \u201cdisrespect\u201d, \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d and other violations under the rules of the brig in which she is being held at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, have prompted an outpouring of anger from the public. The original petition posted by the internet freedom group Fight for the Future has gained more than 15,000 signatures, together with about 20,000 combined for petitions from Roots Action and Demand Progress. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge response from the public,\u201d said Fight for the Future\u2019s Evan Greer. \u201cJust by threatening Chelsea with solitary confinement for such clearly trivial charges, the military is attempting to silence her and violate her right to free speech.\u201d On Thursday the formal charge sheets were published for the first time, by Manning\u2019s Twitter feed, @xyChelsea. Under the charge \u201cMedicine Misuse\u201d, the military authorities relate to a search of the prisoner\u2019s cell on 9 July 2015. \u201cA tube of anti-cavity toothpaste, MKIC, was found in your possession past its expiration date of 9 April 2015. You are involved in violation of ACC Policy Letter 16, using, possessing, handling or storing of medicine, except as authorized by the facility medical staff. Failure to take medication as prescribed by medical staff.\u201d A further charge of \u201cProhibited property\u201d says that \u201cyour cell was inspected and prohibited property was found in your possession. You are in violation of ACC Policy Letter 16, anything not specifically authorized by proper authority to be in a prisoner\u2019s possession is prohibited.\u201d Manning has told supporters that the property that was confiscated from her cell included the memoir I Am Malala by Nobel peace prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, a novel featuring trans women called A Safe Girl to Love, the LGBT publication Out Magazine, the Caitlyn Jenner issue of Vanity Fair and a copy of Cosmopolitan that included an interview with Manning. The property, the military said in newly published documents, was not \u201cproperly marked with inmate\u2019s name and registration number\u201d. In a heavily redacted document marked \u201cinvestigator activity summary\u201d the military authorities said some of the charges arose from an incident on 2 July. Manning was originally charged with \u201cconduct which threatens\u201d but later authorities decided that accusation was unmerited and removed it. The US army insists that it is behaving in a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d way in disciplining Manning, who has been in captivity for the past five years having been arrested at a US army base outside Iraq in 2010. She was given a 35-year sentence for having been the source of the vast leak of US state secrets to WikiLeaks. In a statement to the Guardian, army spokeswoman Tatjana Christian said that the military \u201cremains committed to a fair and equitable process in the adjudication of administrative matters for all of its soldiers\u201d. She said that Manning had been put in front of the Disciplinary and Adjustment Board for alleged rules violations. Christian also said that discipline boards were a \u201ccommon practice in correctional systems\u201d. But the charges leveled against Manning have been described by the soldier\u2019s lawyers as \u201cridiculous\u201d and a form of harassment. She has been accused of showing \u201cdisrespect\u201d based on her sweeping food on the floor during dinner chow, and has been reprimanded for demanding to be able to consult her own lawyer during a dispute with a prison guard. Manning is a transgender woman who is 184 days into hormone replacement therapy, a widely recognized treatment for gender dysphoria \u2013 a person\u2019s sense that their physical gender and identity are out of sync. She had to fight for the treatment by issuing a lawsuit against her military captors, and is still prohibited from growing her hair longer than male military limits. When she was first held in military captivity in the US having been brought back from Iraq, at the brig in Quantico marine base in Virginia, she was subjected to prolonged solitary confinement in conditions that were widely denounced as inhumane and even as a form of torture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
