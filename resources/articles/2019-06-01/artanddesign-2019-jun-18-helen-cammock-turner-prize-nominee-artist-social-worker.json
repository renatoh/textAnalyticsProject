The building sits at the back of, and forms the stage-set for, the Trevi fountain: from its windows you can look down to the crowds of tourists staring up at Oceanus and his tritons. Cammock was hand-making a book in the studios downstairs; elsewhere in the building is one of the world\u2019s outstanding collections relating to fine art printing, including Piranesi\u2019s own metal plates with their glorious, finely etched lines. For Cammock, much of 2018 passed on a kind of Italian grand tour, in Florence, Rome, Palermo, Bologna, Venice and Reggio Emilia. It was a remarkable time of freedom and adventure. \u201cI have never had space to just focus on making work, ever,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always had loads of jobs \u2013 and most artists do.\u201d The reason for this unexpected period was that she won the Max Mara award, which recognises women artists based in the UK. The prize is a tailor-made six-month residency in Italy, followed by exhibitions at the Whitechapel Gallery in London and the Collezione Maramotti \u2013 the museum in Reggio Emilia established by Max Mara\u2019s founder, Achille Maramotti. When we next meet, in her London studio this spring, she is about to be nominated for the Turner prize. The exhibition opens in September at Turner Contemporary in Margate, ahead of the winner\u2019s announcement in December. All this represents a remarkably swift ascension through the art world: at 48, she is a latecomer, entering art school at 35. Before that, she spent a decade in social work in Brighton. She was utterly committed, she tells me, and the work was rewarding \u2013 at least for the first eight years or so. But in the late 1990s, when services were being cut, she became disillusioned. \u201cA couple of times I was putting young people in situations I wasn\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d she says. \u201cI was asked to take a 13-year-old, who had been thrown out by her mother and had no other family, and leave her on her own outside a police station rather than take her inside \u2013 because if I left her outside, the police would have to pay for a place to sleep and if I took her in, social services would have to pay. I was in the car with her, and she was crying and saying, \u2018Helen, don\u2019t leave me.\u2019\u201d She refused to leave the girl, and had to confront her boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss. It was a turning point. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is it.\u2019 But while I was thinking that I did evening classes in photography. And at the university in Brighton they used to do this thing called Saturday art school, which was a completely different level of teaching, of working with the camera. And I thought, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to do this. So I left statutory services. And I did a BA.\u2019\u201d While she was studying, she was still running a multi-agency centre on an estate in Brighton; and even now, though she feels it may be time to stop, she sits on a panel that makes recommendations about the suitability of potential foster carers. After her degree, she was invited to run the Brighton Photo Fringe; it was there that a tutor from the Royal College of Art saw a film of hers, left his card at the desk, and suggested she come and study with him. For the work, Character Building, she filmed places where she recalled acts of racism directed at her family from her earliest childhood \u2013 her mother, who was white, being called a \u201cnigger lover\u201d outside Ealing Town Hall; a man coming up to her mother in a Somerset car park and asking, of Cammock and her sister, \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d She was still working at the Photo Fringe when studying, and ran herself ragged; one of her tutors took her aside and told her to step back, and just try to write something every day. \u201cThat was hugely important, because I started to believe I could write. It underpins everything, it\u2019s the core of everything. Text is everywhere \u2013 not story like a linear narrative but me wanting to say something. Everything is about me wanting to say something. \u201cIt\u2019s about confidence. In my 20s, when I was desperately trying to find something creative, I had this huge hole. I started to write a novel. Then I got burgled and they took my laptop and it was all gone. I didn\u2019t want to write again for a while. So I bought some canvas and some acrylic paints. And it was about making marks, about using colour and form. I didn\u2019t take it seriously and I wouldn\u2019t paint now. But now I trust the marks I make and I don\u2019t have to apologise for them.\u201d Her late-blooming confidence in mark-making was apparent in Rome, where she was making etchings in concise, flowing lines for her book. On other legs of her tour she was taking Italian lessons with migrants in Palermo; working with a choreographer in Florence; filming a performance on Beatrice Cenci\u2019s spinet in Bologna (Cenci was beheaded for murdering her rapist father in 1599); running workshops for migrant women in Reggio Emilia; and taking classical singing lessons in Venice so she could learn music by the great baroque composer Barbara Strozzi. It is a lyric from a Strozzi aria that gives its name to the Whitechapel exhibition, Che Si Pu\u00f2 Fare \u2013 \u201cwhat can be done\u201d. All of this was part of an investigation into the idea of lament, specifically women\u2019s lament. \u201cI think what I was looking for was an understanding of lament being about loss and longing \u2013 but also resilience and resistance,\u201d she says \u2013 lament as a survival strategy, lament as strength. \u201cLament recurs, I now realise, through all the work I make. It is about historical loss, my parents\u2019 sense of loss and the things that were painful and sad for them: racism, and the barriers they faced. I\u2019m sad about it but I also want to change it.\u201d All of this will come together into a work for the Whitechapel that embraces film, performance and text \u2013 Cammock\u2019s trademark polyphonic mix. In a way, Cammock\u2019s meandering path towards making work is all the more surprising given that her father was an art teacher. But Helen \u2013 unlike her more obviously arty elder sister, Sandy \u2013 \u201cwas a sort of joke, the person who couldn\u2019t draw. Drawing was always to do with life drawing or producing something recognisable and I was terrible at it. And I had no patience. I ran around like a busy bee, playing football and climbing trees.\u201d Sandy quite often used to do her art homework for her. \u201cMy dad was a ceramicist as well as an art teacher and in the ceramics class at school I was in the remedial group \u2026 I was a total disaster area.\u201d And yet she was creative. When she was 12, her father took early retirement and the family moved from London to Somerset \u2013 a rupturing that Cammock describes as \u201chell on earth\u201d. In desperation she picked up a guitar and started writing songs. Her mother took her to play at a folk club one night, which, she hadn\u2019t realised, was on the West Country touring circuit. She was spotted by a promoter \u2013 and began a teenage life of performing, being driven around clubs in south-west England, chaperoned by her mum. But then came university, \u201cand I trained as a social worker and played in bands for a bit, but social work took over and I didn\u2019t sing for 10 years\u201d. Her father died too young to see his younger daughter becoming a successful artist; but her mother, who died just over a year ago, was immensely proud. Sandy\u2019s theory is that Cammock\u2019s mindset has stayed consistent. \u201c[My sister] said, \u2018The thing about you is that you\u2019ve always had things you\u2019ve wanted to say and you\u2019ve wanted to change things. When you were younger you did it through songwriting, then through being a social worker and now as an artist.\u201d I wonder which has proved the most effective strategy. \u201cWell I suppose if I had wanted to make real change I would have become a politician.\u201d Good idea, I suggest. \u201cDon\u2019t joke,\u201d says Cammock. \u201cIt has been said.\u201d Maybe that will be Cammock\u2019s next act. We should be so lucky. Che Si Pu\u00f2 Fare, is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 26 June to 1 September.
