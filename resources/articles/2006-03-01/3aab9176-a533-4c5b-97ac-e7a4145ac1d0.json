My friend Rob and I are standing sheepishly against the sitting room wall of a regular suburban home outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, along with 50 or so female sparring partners, dressed, for the most part, in very little. That's how you wrestle: nearly naked but for a bottle of oil. They mill about, swigging tequila, chugging beer from a keg, eating tortilla chips and hot dogs. Apart from one hermaphrodite wearing a kind of diminutive loincloth made out of duct tape, who says he's stopped off in the middle of a walk across America with his husky sled dog, and a male referee wearing a tux but no shoes, socks or shirt, Rob and I are the only men. 'Why would they want us there?' I asked Rob the day before over coffee. He used to work alongside one of the aficionados. 'It's like a Fight Club deal,' he said. 'An underground thing. They're getting in touch with hidden parts of themselves. Ancient energies.' He smiled at me. 'Come on. This is Santa Fe.' Santa Fe, or Fanta Se as some call it, is the natural home of the fad. Bracelets imbued with Pluto energy. Crystals to make your carrots grow. Deep-core body-work. Whatever new 'spiritual technology' might be making tentative inroads into West Coast life 1,000 miles away becomes mainstream here. The latest one is female wrestling parties, which congregate at secret locations for their late-night bouts. The contestants are generally middle class, with white-collar jobs, looking for a new way to vent the frustration and anomie of contemporary life, so they say. There was some cloak-and-dagger getting here: Rob had to call someone, who called someone else, who called back to divulge the evening's password. Then there was a night drive 10 miles out into the desert, with the Sangre de Cristo mountains a black presence to one side. Finally we turned on to a dirt road and into an improbable new development of homes among the little volcanic hills to the south of town. Two or three dozen cars lined the track. As soon as we stepped out a flashlight shone in our faces. 'Password?' snapped a contralto with a clipboard, who then led us down a path among juniper bushes, her trainers and bare calves flashing beneath the hem of a fur coat. Inside, the trappings of a normal home have all been moved away for the night. The sitting room floor has been covered with black rubber matting that gleams under rented spotlights. 'No inappropriate use of hands,' screams the referee as two women grapple with each other. The ref has two sidekicks, line judges, women in Stetsons and holsters containing a spray bottle of oil each, whose job it is to spray the contestants from head to toe at the start of each bout. 'It's about the Artemis energy,' one eager-to-wrestle Amazon tells me, glancing anxiously over her shoulder to see if she's missing any of the action. I can't help wondering what she'd look like with clothes on. She's big in a way you'd think no self-respecting Artemis could countenance: she's a silicon Amazon. 'You know, like Diana?' she continues. 'Like we're reclaiming that energy. That's what we're doing here.' The misfit, wayward, visionary, eccentric: New Mexico is home to them all, as well as to a disproportionate number of arts luminaries of the 20th century. Taos, an hour up the road, is the only place where DH Lawrence ever owned a home. Aldous Huxley, Bob Dylan, Gene Hackman, Bruce Nauman, the notorious Bean Farm Commune (where the acid trip in Easy Rider was shot, and where psychedelic clown Wavy Gravy dispensed his infamous acid stew), Kerouac, Kesey, Dennis Hopper - all have either resided or passed through. But it's home not only to the new: also to the Pueblo Indians, who still live up and down the Rio Grande valley in adobe villages, the oldest inhabited structures in all the Americas, dating back 1,000 years. New Mexico calls itself the Land of Enchantment but it might better be the Land of the Cure. Mabel Dodge Luhan, the American heiress and patron of the arts, came out in the Twenties from the East Coast, married a Taos Indian, and plotted her cure of western civilisation from here. The first step was recruiting DH Lawrence. After reading Sons and Lovers and Fantasia of the Unconscious she recognised Lawrence as the author destined to convey to the world the message of renewal that she thought she'd extracted from the heart of the Indian pueblos. She was so determined to entice him to come that she sent his wife Frieda a necklace steeped in irresistible Indian magic and wrote to famous friends beseeching them in turn to write to Lawrence about the new dawn of civilisation happening in Taos. He did come, but had his own agenda. For years he'd been wanting to found Rananim, a utopian community with him in charge, where the ills of modern Anglo-culture were to be cured by a return to an elemental instinctive life. Rananim never had more than three members - the Lawrences themselves, plus their die-hard follower Lady Dorothy Brett; even Mabel Dodge resisted - but its setting was stunning. Mabel gave Lawrence a little ranch-house up in the mountains above Taos, which he memorialised beautifully in Mornings in Mexico In the Sixties the counterculture blossomed in New Mexico, with its own promises of cures for all the ills of the modern psyche (drop out, tune in etc), and with such shrines of healing as the various local communes. Dennis Hopper ended up buying Mabel Dodge's house on the edge of Taos (a marvellous old adobe castle in which Lawrence painted the bathroom windows with geometric designs in order to protect Mabel's modesty from prying eyes), where Hopper and his entourage plunged into a maelstrom of hedonism which would necessitate its own cures - rehab and recovery - in due course. Today the search for DIY cures of the spirit still goes on here. The all-organic supermarkets in town offer in-aisle head and neck massages should the shopping become overwhelming. And their bulletin boards offer all kinds of fantastic help such as Akashic healing consultations. ('The information received comes directly from the Akashic Records,' one flier happily claims, 'an archive of information on the journey of each soul'). A punter is quoted as saying: 'Janine [the therapist] has the rare gift of being directly connected with source.' Source? No capital letter, no article, just plain old source. Equine-assisted psychotherapy (yes: talk to the horse). And the local radio station interrupts its programming every so often to broadcast the 'Moon Minute', an update on the astrological weather ('With Neptune trining Mars in the Third House, today is all about contacting the collective in each of us'). It's easy to scoff. Santa Fe is full of people searching. That's why they move here, to find big answers. Absolute answers. For that, and also for the somehow comforting, rounded adobe architecture, and the smell of pi\u00f1on firewood at night, and the open desert all around, and the delicious piquant local food with its reliance on fiery fresh chilli. It's the one part of America with a visible culture that goes back more than 300 years. It was a lonely province of the Spanish Empire from the 1550s, when Franciscan monks wandered north from Chihuahua, and over the next 50 years produced more martyrs of the church than any other part of the Spanish possessions, as the friars encroached on Indian land. Of course, there's no need to go anywhere in order to plumb the meaning of life; yet pilgrimage and quest are embedded in spiritual aspiration, and maybe it takes courage, as well as naivety perhaps, to up sticks and go in blind or demented faith to a place where you hope to resolve your life. (And it's surely better to go off searching than to drown your despair in the bottom of a bottle without even trying.) I first came 12 years ago, in my late twenties, sponsored by a loyal editor, ostensibly to write a book about DH Lawrence's time here. He declared of New Mexico that it was the only place that ever changed him from the outside. It took a while to realise the footsteps I was really following were those of Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry, the lovable outlaws who had saved Mondays for me as a child. At 8.10pm at the start of every week I'd be found in front of the TV: ' ... and in all the trains and banks they robbed they never shot anyone'. Alias Smith and Jones. I haven't seen an episode in 20 years, but I still think of it as the ultimate justification of TV. The hare-brained schemes, the feisty old-timers in log cabins, the occasional pretty girl, their intuitive horses, the whiskies and saloons, and the land they lived in: the dry, empty space, the cactus and eucalyptus, scrub and sage, the ziggurat-like canyons with their steps of rock and scree. They'd lie on blankets under the stars while a fire flickered beneath a coffee pot. What a way to live. We actually tried to recreate it. The summer we were 13, a couple of friends and I slept out, with sleeping bags, tobacco, beer, firelighters and sausages. We made tea with river water which we had to load up with sugar to hide the riverine tang. One of us even brought a mouth-organ once - once was enough. Mike Reynolds is a kind of outlaw, and he's angry. With his white stubble and white straggly hair, and a bright intelligence in his eyes, he's looking up at me as I sit in the back of his big truck, and explaining what has been going on in his world - the 'Greater World Community' - out on the rolling desert west of Taos. It's turning to late afternoon, and his face has just acquired the roseate patina that the late light throws on all things out here around 4.30 on a winter afternoon. No matter where you are and what you're doing, it's an hour of great beauty. He's a visionary, he's what happened to the Sixties, the grown-up face of hippiedom. The drugs are gone (well, mostly), the rehab is done, and the first thing the expanded consciousness saw is that the planet needed saving. Reynolds is the mastermind behind Earthships, the ultimate eco-homes. His story is that while he was meditating in his home-built backyard pyramid one afternoon in 1970, out on the Taos mesa, a merry band of wizards appeared and told him how to save the planet. He has spent the last 35 years following their instructions. The key was garbage. 'I'd seen these two programmes on TV,' Reynolds explains. 'One was about the growing garbage problem, one about the timber shortage for housebuilding, and I thought: there's a solution here somewhere. Then the wizards came and showed me.' Missionary, maverick, revolutionary, bad boy of architecture (his licence was recently withdrawn and now he calls himself a 'biotect' instead), Reynolds is a veteran of run-ins with the authorities. 'They had to take my licence away. I was breaking every rule. I run sewage right through the living room, we're building out of garbage. You can't do that.' But he already has a legendary status in the green world. Some call him the Garbage King. 'We have mountains of tyres all across the world. And there's no safe way of getting rid of them. When you beat earth into them they become the densest thermal mass you could want. Great for building.' So he builds houses out of old tyres and beer cans. The Taos winters are severe, at 7,000ft, but Earthships sit at a constant 24C, give or take a few degrees. Half-bunker, half-greenhouse, with their plants, big windows and fat beams, they're as cosy as a Hobbit cottage, but as bright as a conservatory. Smothered in adobe, with hardly a straight line in them, and with walls studded with the silver discs that are the bases of beer cans, they are strangely beautiful. And they have no 'carbon footprint'. No energy enters or leaves them. We're parked at the edge of the Greater World Community, a square mile of barren desert that is the world's first housing development that is absolutely off the grid. No pipes or wires of any kind come in or out of this little suburb. Instead, every home is not a house but, as Reynolds puts it, 'a water-producing, heat-producing, food-producing organism that coexists with and sustains the human organism.' It looks like one of the blighted towns on a barren planet in Star Wars Just now he's angry because the state governor promised him a half-million dollar grant for his Earthship Visitor Centre last year - and suddenly the offer was pulled. Mysteriously, just at the same time, the governor agreed to co-finance the world's first space port in southern New Mexico. 'It's Earthships versus Spaceships,' he says. And the spaceport is the brainchild of none other than Richard Branson. 'He should have known better than to fight against sustainability. He's a man with a brain.' Earthships, spaceships, space-ports - my seven-year-old son Stevie is loving it. We've been tooling around in Reynolds's open truck, climbing all over the earth roofs of the houses, admiring the bananas growing inside them. Every Earthship has plant beds. They are the sewage system. Their roots oxygenate the waste water and clean it. Then that water flushes the toilet. Which then goes out to a septic tank. And ultimately into outdoor plant beds. My son seems fascinated with the difference between 'grey' and 'black' water. Meanwhile, the Sangre de Cristo mountains, under their winter dollop of snow, have become luminous, the colour of orange sorbet. To the south the distant ranges are blue. And to the east the big slopes and ramps of sage-covered desert glitter under the low sun. There's something planetary about the Taos mesa. There's scant vegetation. You can see a hundred miles of the earth's bare crust stretching away in most directions, except where the land has risen up in spectacular volcanic ranges. A few miles away, just near the gorge of the Rio Grande, which is 700ft deep here, there's an Earthship guesthouse where we're staying tonight. It's a large, sprawling house on top of a knoll, with a huge circular living room and two spare bedrooms for the guests. Run by a retired couple from Dallas, it has a somewhat suburban feel compared to some of the Reynolds houses I've been in, but the views are stunning. Earthships have slanting south-facing windows. To stand at one of them at dawn, with a waning moon hanging above the mesa, and the land turning metal blue in the early light - you feel there's nothing between you and space. It's somehow graphic here that humans are a species stuck to this partially vegetated, mostly bare planet spinning in infinite space. In the morning Stevie and I clamber down a path into the river gorge. It's icy cold in the deep shade of the canyon, but by the fast brown river there are hot springs. Two pools steam copiously, surrounded by rocks rimed with frost a shade of pale blue in the morning shadow. We strip off rapidly, standing on towels so our feet don't glue themselves to the frozen rocks, and slip into the delicious water. It's strange to reflect that we're only here because of DH Lawrence. He opened up New Mexico to literary Europe. In a sense you could even call this a little corner of England. The Lawrences, Dorothy Brett, and Aldous Huxley not only spent time here, but set a certain stamp on the place - an odd amalgam of heavyweight culture and true flakiness that continues to this day. I remember reading Lawrence's description of his ranch one winter at university - the cold rain outside my little rented room, an essay I didn't want to write waiting stubbornly. Randomly, I plucked a book off the shelves, and there it was: the log cabin, the tequila with hot water and lemon, the pines, the mountains, eagles, coyotes. But for all New Mexico's pride in being forward-looking, on some kind of cutting edge - the plethora of strange therapies for the soul, the blueprints for the world's first space port, the Santa Fe Institute, a science think-tank with a roll-call of Nobel laureates set up by Murray Gell-Mann, the discoverer of the quark - this is still, as Lawrence said, an ancient land. The New Age may be flourishing here, but in the silent desert, or up among whistling pines on a mountainside, it's easy to hear Lawrence's words still ringing, when he declared that Europe was incomparably younger, 'never, never for a moment able to comprehend the wonderful, hoary age of America'. \u00b7 Henry Shukman's collection of poetry In Dr No's Garden is published by Cape (\u00a38).
