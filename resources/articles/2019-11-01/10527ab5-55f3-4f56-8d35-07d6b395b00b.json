In a totally relatable and in no way weird outing at a primary school, the prime minister struggled through a rendition of The Wheels on the Bus. Still, the school has a good Ofsted rating, so he should really start coming on in a few weeks. Seat of the week Intergalactic hjinx have hit Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Lord Buckethead, an ironclad extraterrestrial who has run against several prime ministers, announced he was competing for the seat as Count Binface after \u201can unpleasant battle on the planet Copyright\u201d. His pledge to bring back Ceefax looked set to capture the zeitgeist, until a new candidate called Lord Buckethead(\u2122) emerged \u2013 risking a fatal split in the objects-for-heads vote. Despairing voters may now just vote for one of those tedious parody candidates, like the obviously absurd and rather cliched public-school caricature \u201cBoris Johnson\u201d. Still these eccentric characters are part of Britain\u2019s rich election tradition, aren\u2019t they? Policy of the week Surprise this week as business figures came out against their companies being nationalised. The boss of BT suggested \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 that Labour\u2019s plan to nationalise part of the telecoms company was a bad idea. Critics said the plan would hit investment or cost tens of billions. The obvious flaw, though, is the naive assumption that Jeremy Corbyn will be able to get through to someone at BT to tell them they\u2019ve been taken over. The best advice for the Labour leader - take a few days off work and stay on hold. Candidate of the week Interesting tactics from the Brexit party, with some candidates telling voters not to vote for them. Dudley North hopeful Rupert Lowe announced he would no longer be running in the Labour-held marginal. The move was designed to help the Conservatives win the seat, trusting Boris Johnson to deliver Brexit. After all, if there\u2019s one word that really sums up the prime minister, \u201ctrustworthy\u201d is right up there. Questionable strategy decisions seem to plague Lowe. Back in the 2000s, he secured the services of England\u2019s rugby world cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodard to oversee the performance of his club side. Quite a coup, you\u2019d think \u2013 except that his club, Southampton, played football and not rugby. Much like Lowe\u2019s political career, it didn\u2019t end well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
