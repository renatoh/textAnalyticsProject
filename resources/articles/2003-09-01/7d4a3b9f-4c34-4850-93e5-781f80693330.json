Lucas Neill's challenge on Carragher during Blackburn's 3-1 home defeat to Liverpool on Saturday broke the England defender's leg and ruled him out for up to six months. Houllier branded the belated apology issued by Neill and Souness \"pathetic\", riled as the Frenchman was by the Rovers manager's assertion that \"only those who played football at the highest level would understand what happened\". Houllier was further incensed because Blackburn's apology had been 48 hours in coming. \"What is unacceptable is their lack of grace and dignity,\" said Liverpool's manager. Sky Television is unlikely to share live coverage of the crucial European Championship qualifier between England and Turkey with the BBC or ITV, despite government calls for the game to be shown on terrestrial television to discourage fans from travelling to Istanbul. However, there remains \"a good chance\" that a deal can be reached that would allow one of the broadcasters to show highlights or repeat the game in full after the final whistle on October 11. The sports minister Richard Caborn will be making representations to Sky in an effort to persuade it to share the coverage. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, has claimed that referees are awarding too many penalties. After leaping to the defence of his midfielder Robert Pires, Wenger maintained that there were more blatant instances of players attempting to win penalties last weekend, citing the examples of Kevin Phillips, of Southampton, and Newcastle's Olivier Bernard. \"Robert has told me that he was touched and didn't dive. I am against diving, like everybody else.\" Jermaine Pennant has vowed that Leeds will not crumble after their mauling at Leicester in the Premiership on Monday night. Their manager Peter Reid had included five of his loan signings in the starting line-up, with a sixth on the bench. Pennant, himself on a two-month loan from Arsenal, believed that was not the reason behind Leeds's abject performance. \"I don't think it was really a case of too many new players not having time to gel,\" he insisted. \"This was just one of those days when nothing really went right for us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
