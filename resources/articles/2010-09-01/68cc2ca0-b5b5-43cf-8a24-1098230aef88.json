The delegates are, in the main, still very much up for the deal which they made in May with the Conservatives. Nick Clegg, addressing the conference yesterday for the second successive day \u2013 he makes it three in a row today in his party leader's speech \u2013 clearly got the benefit of the doubt from the delegates. But there are plenty of doubts there all the same \u2013 several of which surfaced in yesterday's question-and-answer session \u2013 and Mr Clegg apparently feels sufficiently uneasy about the mood to have devoted much of his time yesterday, and indeed the content of his Observer interview, to scotching fears of a sell-out of party values. Mr Clegg's core belief is that coalition government works as well if not better in modern societies than single-party rule. He therefore thinks it is in his party's long-term interest to stay the course with David Cameron's Conservatives in order to prove the point. Public acceptance of coalitions is, he said yesterday, the big prize at stake in British politics. Mr Clegg told the hall that he is playing a long game and that it would be disastrous for any future coalitions if this one was to fall apart over a single issue. Any short-term satisfaction to be gained from such a refusal to compromise would be outweighed by a longer-term failure which would cost the party dear for years. The Lib Dems should beware the temptation of grabbing at what Mr Clegg called \"synthetic differences\". There is much sense in that argument. The problem with it, however, is that some of the compromises into which Mr Clegg and his Lib Dem ministerial colleagues are inevitably being drawn are anything but synthetic. The disproportionate impact of the public spending review on the poor and the young, the subject of the first question from the floor to Mr Clegg yesterday, is certainly not a synthetic difference but a fundamental threat to social justice with which no liberal of the post-Lloyd George era should feel comfortable. Yet though the spending cuts, of which Mr Clegg made too light yesterday, are surely the most serious of them, they are not the only such issue. A year ago, Vince Cable's harrying of the too-big-to-fail relationship between reckless banks and the taxpayer who was expected to bail them out was crucial in boosting Liberal Democrat credibility. But where is structural banking reform today in the list of priorities of the government of which Mr Cable is now a member? A year ago, Mr Clegg and his party played a brave role in exposing the outrageous incidence of telephone hacking against public figures by the News of the World, while simultaneously warning against the increasing concentration of media ownership. Today, they are timid and worse on the issue. Others will have their own wobbling points: the lack of a vigorous defence of the public realm, whether in respect of the Royal Mail or the BBC; the lack of clarity on funding for the green development bank on which the coalition's green credentials largely rest; the failure to speak up for an arts sector which brings in far more money than the taxpayer spends on it. All these things matter. Mr Clegg wants his party to accept ownership of the whole coalition project, including the bits that stick in many Lib Dem craws. That is the way of coalitions and fair enough, up to a point. Yet Mr Clegg is in grave danger of being too sweeping. He should remember that a fixation with big political prizes can cause leaders to foolishly dismiss early criticisms which they brush off as relatively trivial but which help in time to define them \u2013 Tony Blair over the Bernie Ecclestone deal, for example. Mr Clegg's critics are not all coalition haters or political innocents. They deserve serious answers to serious questions. The Liberal Democrat leader needs to start that process of engagement in his speech today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
