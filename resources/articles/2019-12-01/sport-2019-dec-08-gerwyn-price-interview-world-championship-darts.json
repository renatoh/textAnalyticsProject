On a grey Thursday in the Welsh valleys, he is thoughtful and reflective as he ponders his unlikely journey to the top of a sport he barely played until adulthood. Six years ago, he was a professional rugby player for Neath, throwing a few arrows in his spare evenings. This week, however, he will step out at Alexandra Palace in London as the coming force of darts: the two-time Grand Slam champion, the provisional world No 2 and one of the most electrifying and controversial characters in the sport. How it all happened is the question everyone wants to ask. He does not quite know the answer, but what he does know is that when he pulls that shiny shirt over his tightly coiled frame, it may as well be a superhero\u2019s cape, awakening something in him. The adrenalin begins to course. He is prone to bellow in opponents\u2019 faces at full volume. And he starts playing devastating darts. In a game dominated by psyche, Price has created a feared character with no apparent ceiling. \u201cA lot of people can throw darts,\u201d explains Price. \u201cIt\u2019s just how they think about the game. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve improved. My mind is different.\u201d As recently as 18 months ago, the 34-year-old Price was still essentially a journeyman player with a few notable wins to his name. That all changed at last year\u2019s Grand Slam of Darts, when he beat double world champion Gary Anderson in a heated final \u2013 more on that in a sec \u2013 to win his first major TV title. Even more incredibly, he defended it last month, brushing aside the formidable world No 1, Michael van Gerwen, in the process. The Dutchman, still overwhelmingly the man to beat, firmly denies the upstart challenger has got into his head. Which is probably an admission that he has, a little bit. For Price, who turned professional in 2014, it comes down to ambition. \u201cEighteen months ago,\u201d he says, \u201cyou turn up and you\u2019re like: \u2018Just get through the first round.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t bothered about winning tournaments at the beginning. I just wanted to win enough money so I could stay on the tour, earn a living for my family. But then when you start to win, you just want more and more.\u201d Not everyone has been thrilled by Price\u2019s rise. That first Grand Slam title was marred by a spat with Anderson, taking umbrage at his aggressive, extravagant celebrations. Price\u2019s first major trophy was awarded in a hailstorm of boos from the Wolverhampton crowd, his antics earning him the biggest fine issued in darts \u2013 \u00a321,500, later halved on appeal. His family have been targeted by social-media abuse. Fellow rising star Michael Smith has warned Price that he needs to \u201clearn when to shut up\u201d. Put it this way: in every walk of life, there are certain people who just seem calibrated to put noses out of joint. In darts, Price seems to be one of them. Very little of this abrasive stage persona survives the transition back to the real world. As we talk at his local golf club near Caerphilly, he reckons now that the whole bad boy of darts thing got a little out of hand. \u201cI\u2019m not the only person that shows emotion,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority do and it\u2019s hard to hold back. People think I do it to put people off. I just need it to get myself going. It didn\u2019t really bother people when they were beating me.\u201d The great Sid Waddell once compared darts to a Christmas cracker: you need the wrapping on the outside just as much as the bang in the middle and for a sport still trying to fill its Phil Taylor-shaped void and desperately in search of new heroes and antiheroes, perhaps Price was just a handy heel. \u201cYou were turning up to games and one or two people would boo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThen a few more would join in. I was painted as the villain of darts. I accepted it to a certain extent. But it got a bit over the top.\u201d The low point came at last year\u2019s world championship, when Price was relentlessly barracked during his second-round defeat to Nathan Aspinall, his missed doubles cheered. Did it affect him? \u201cObviously you notice,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind booing through games. The crowd pay their money, and that\u2019s how you earn a living. I can take a bit of the pantomime villain. But if you\u2019re going for a double, that\u2019s when you should just get a little bit of respect.\u201d The irony is that taken in its entirety, Price\u2019s story is a rather uplifting tale: a testament to vision and opportunity, the courage to jack in one dream and pursue another. Having left school at 16 with aspirations of playing international rugby, Price represented Wales at all the age-group levels without quite fulfilling his potential at senior level. Aged 30, and with injuries piling up, he began to plot his next move. That was when a side door unexpectedly opened to him. Price hadn\u2019t thrown a dart until leaving school. There was a board in the bar of the local rugby club where he worked and occasionally if it was a quiet morning Price would have a little throw. He wasn\u2019t particularly good, but later he would start playing in the pub on Friday nights, and discovered he had a natural aptitude for the game. He won a cluster of local tournaments against grizzled veterans, went down to the PDC\u2019s qualifying school on a whim and to everyone\u2019s surprise, not least his own, scythed through the draw and won a tour card. Price hung up his boots, kissed goodbye to his modest Neath salary of around \u00a325,000, and threw himself into the arrows. He quickly found his first sporting career a valuable asset. Not only had it taught him the knack of raising his game under pressure, as well as the dangers of over-practice, but in a world of pot bellies and poor diets, Price\u2019s front-row physique actually provided him with something of an edge. \u201cOn Pro Tours [smaller weekend tournaments], it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when it comes to the big TV events, the longer formats, that\u2019s when it matters. It\u2019s hard to be carrying a lot of weight in the heat. You\u2019re going to be sweaty, your hands are going to be sweaty, you\u2019re not throwing the same darts because you haven\u2019t got the same grip. If you\u2019re overweight, those factors can put you off your game.\u201d With the world championship comprising a three-week slog in north London over the festive period, only the strongest will survive. Price has never gone beyond the last 16 at the Palace, but such has been his hot streak that bookmakers make it virtually a two-horse race between him and the redoubtable Van Gerwen, going for his fourth world crown. \u201cHe\u2019s the best player in the world, but he\u2019s there to be knocked off,\u201d Price insists. \u201cOn his day, he\u2019s practically unbeatable. But on my day, so am I.\u201d There are times, he admits, when the ex-rugby player line rankles with him slightly. \u201cThis rugby thing has got to be parked now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing darts for six or seven years. I\u2019m a professional. That\u2019s how I\u2019d rather be known.\u201d If he ends up lifting the world championship trophy on 1 January, you suspect he\u2019ll get his wish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
