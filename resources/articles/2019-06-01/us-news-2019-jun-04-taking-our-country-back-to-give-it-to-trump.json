No doubt after his tongue had been loosened by imbibing, the grandee told my friend that: \u201cWe are going to get rid of the NHS. It\u2019s a socialist invention.\u201d That had the awful ring of truth about it those many years ago. Trump now seems keen to facilitate this government\u2019s wish to privatise the NHS (Report, 3 June). How long before we see an American-style NHS? Not long, I fear. Dr Stephen Pacey North Muskham, Nottinghamshire \u2022 I have never quite understood the leave campaign\u2019s wish to \u201ctake our country back\u201d. I didn\u2019t realise we had lost it, but it now becomes clear \u2013 they want it back to give to the United States. God forbid. Carlotta Kramskoy Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol \u2022 Jacob Rees-Mogg says an elected American president cannot be compared to Mussolini and Hitler, who were mass murderers. But both of them were elected leaders first, too, so the comparison can be made. Rees-Mogg has had a failure with his \u201chistory book\u201d. He obviously is as poor over more modern European history. David Critchard Exeter \u2022 In his praise for the Queen, President Trump, diplomatically, did not mention that he was elected to his position and that the British people have no choice. Jenny Bushell London \u2022 Written from the perspective of the last century, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy states: \u201cThe President\u2019s job \u2013 and if someone vain and stupid enough is picked he [sic] won\u2019t realise this \u2013 is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change... Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire \u2022 Can us radical crochet practitioners please have access to Tatiana\u2019s Trump crochet pattern (Letters page photo, 4 June)? It will come in very handy for future demonstrations (and Christmas presents). Please also tell me she\u2019s made it for her politics A-level?
