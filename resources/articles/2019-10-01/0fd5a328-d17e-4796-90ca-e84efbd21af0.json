The USA manager was in town to watch Ajax play Chelsea in the Champions League but first he wanted to issue a public show of support for his country\u2019s best player. Berhalter had heard all about his captain\u2019s slow start to life in England and he had decided it was time to build a more positive narrative around Pulisic. Berhalter knew it was unlikely the \u00a358m forward would start against Ajax on Wednesday. Pulisic has found it hard to break into Frank Lampard\u2019s starting lineup and the 21-year-old has seemed overwhelmed since joining Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund last summer. The pressure to show that American footballers are capable of succeeding at the top level is enormous and Lampard has railed against the unforgiving glare on Pulisic, an undemonstrative character burdened with more hype than any player in his nation\u2019s history. \u201cOne of my conversations with Christian was to say I can comprehend what you are going through but I have never been anywhere close to what you are actually going through,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cThis is unprecedented territory for an American player.\u201d Berhalter, who needs Pulisic to lead USA\u2019s attempts to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, wanted to correct the impression that the quietest player in Chelsea\u2019s squad lacks the personality to thrive at the highest level. \u201cHe\u2019s intense and some people mistake him being quiet for him being shy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he has this intensity that you like to see. It\u2019s almost like an acute focus that when he\u2019s on the field there is this sharpness you can appreciate.\u201d There had been flashes of class when Pulisic came off the bench to help Chelsea beat Newcastle last weekend. \u201cYou saw the change of pace to make things happen,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cIt\u2019s just adapting. The German game and the English game is completely different.\u201d Pulisic arrived with Chelsea operating under a transfer embargo, preventing them from recruiting after selling Eden Hazard to Real Madrid. Yet Berhalter senses there is more patience at Stamford Bridge these days. He does not see Pulisic becoming the next Mohamed Salah or Kevin De Bruyne, both of whom flourished elsewhere after leaving Chelsea in search of more opportunities. \u201cThis is a different model,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Chelsea have done anything similar for a while. I had the pleasure of visiting Chelsea when [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho was there and it was amazing just to see the squad: every player one to 28, was a full international. Now it\u2019s younger talent and I think it\u2019s a more nurturing environment.\u201d Lampard has tried to protect Pulisic, the most expensive player in the history of US football. \u201cIt\u2019s his way of saying what I\u2019m trying to say: the outside stuff is not real,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWhen you analyse the transfer fee, when you analyse who he\u2019s replacing, when you analyse he\u2019s the only guy they bought \u2013 that\u2019s not real. \u201cWhat\u2019s real is this kid is in the Premier League, trying to make his name. That\u2019s the only thing that counts. Frank knows all that stuff is all outside expectations; a narrative that\u2019s been created.\u201d The attention devoted to Pulisic often seems ridiculous. He had a tough time during the international break but Berhalter insists Pulisic was under the weather during USA\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Canada. After the game, clips on social media appeared to show Pulisic crying after being substituted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine he was crying,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cI can imagine there was frustration.\u201d Once the discussion was over Berhalter headed to Ajax\u2019s training ground to watch the Dutch side face Chelsea in an under-19 game. Then it was to the Johan Cruyff Arena. Sure enough, Pulisic was on the bench. His time would come, though. Pulisic replaced Willian during the second half and had a major impact on the left, setting up Michy Batshuayi to score the winner that put Chelsea top of Group H. \u201cThe manager told me: \u2018Go in, make an impact, make a difference,\u2019\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting because this is where I want to be.\u201d It has been hard. Pulisic did not even make the bench when Chelsea won in Lille this month and his only start since 31 August came in last month\u2019s victory over Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. Lampard was unhappy with Pulisic\u2019s performance that night. There have been promising signs since. Pulisic created Batshuayi\u2019s goal in the win over Southampton and, having impressed against Newcastle and Ajax, he has a chance of starting when Chelsea visit Burnley on Saturday. \u201cAgainst Lille we were speaking about Christian being out of the squad,\u201d C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Chelsea\u2019s captain, said. \u201cFair play to Christian for working hard. When he has come on in the last two games he has made a significant impact. He nearly made an assist last Saturday but he was running at people, creating chances, and tonight he got the assist. I am very pleased for Christian because it is a good moment for him.\u201d It was a good moment for US Soccer\u2019s representatives in Amsterdam as well. They were delighted after the game. Pulisic had made sure Berhalter\u2019s trip was worth it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
