Good save with his legs to deny Kane late on. Vladimir Coufal 6 Lost his man for opening goal and looked vulnerable against pace of Sterling and Sancho. Ondrej Celustka 7 Former Sunderland loanee supported Jankto in attack and looked solid in defence most of the time. Jakub Brabec 7 A simple task to knee in the equaliser after England\u2019s calamity of errors and enjoyed tussling with Kane. Jan Boril 7 Had an easy night as England struggled to create much in attack and was a threat from set-pieces. Tomas Soucek 7 Inches away from giving hosts the lead but wasted his second chance. Anchored midfield well in home stadium. Alex Kral 9 Spartak Moscow midfielder always seemed to have time on the ball and had the measure of England\u2019s midfield. Almost scored. Lukas Masopust 7 Fell for Sterling\u2019s trick to concede penalty but almost gave his side the lead with dipping and swerving shot. Vladimir Darida 8 Captain tried to provide support for Schick and set up Kral\u2019s effort on goal with superb one-two. Jakub Jankto 7 Superb set-piece delivery caused England\u2019s defence serious problems but less effective in open play. Patrik Schick 7 His movement proved a real headache for Maguire and Keane at times. Glides over the grass. England Jordan Pickford 7 Good early save to keep England in front but caught on his line for opening goal. No chance for winning goal. Kieran Trippier 6 Solid but unspectacular. With Alexander-Arnold breathing down his neck perhaps needed to be more convincing. Danny Rose 4 At fault for corner which led to goal and booked straight afterwards. Not his best night. Harry Maguire 6 Far from the dominant figure at the back he has been in the past. Looks short of confidence. Michael Keane 5 Guilty of ball watching for Brabec\u2019s goal. Faces a battle to keep his spot for next summer. Declan Rice 5 His slip for the equalising goal compounded the earlier error. Struggled to impose himself against the intelligence of Kral. Jordan Henderson 6 Too many misplaced passes but no shortage of effort as usual. Looks more comfortable in a three-man midfield. Mason Mount 6 Started the game far too high up and barely touched the ball. Much more involved after break. Raheem Sterling 6 Did well to win early penalty but drifted out of the game after that. Failed to convert decent chance in second half. Harry Kane 7 Lovely touch to send Sterling clear in opening minutes and dispatched spot kick with aplomb this time. Jadon Sancho 6 Little chance to spread his wings but looked more comfortable on right flank in second half. Could have scored."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
