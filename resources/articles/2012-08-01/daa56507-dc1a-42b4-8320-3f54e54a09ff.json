Day after day, time after time, BBC Olympic figures have been a triumph \u2013 and so, from Gabby Logan down, has been the commentating and presenting. corporation bashers have mostly taken the fortnight off. Why, unless you're Mark Thompson, snipe at a winning team when, just across the Atlantic, NBC's coverage arrives ultra-nationalistic and ultra-crass? I was going to add that, whatever the BBC paid for Olympic sports rights and production costs, it was worth it. But no one, top to corporation bottom, will tell me what that bill actually amounts to. \"We never divulge production or rights costs as this information is commercially sensitive,\" say various men from Auntie. At NBC, however, they're happy to rattle on about breaking even this time round \u2013 never mind the $1.1bn they paid for rights and the added $200m that went into production. Heaven knows why a giant commercial American TV company manifests no commercial sensitivity whatever while the cherished state broadcaster we all subscribe to promptly tucks its cheque book up a hair-shirt jumper. Try gold for what goes up on screen; and brassed-off when it comes to extracting winning information."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
