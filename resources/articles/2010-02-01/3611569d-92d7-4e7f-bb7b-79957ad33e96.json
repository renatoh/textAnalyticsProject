A late goal from substitute Salif Diao made it four defeats in five games for the bottom-placed side, who will feel frustrated having taken the lead through Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piquionne before half-time, but then threw it away after the break. Only adding to the pain, they were playing against 10 men for the final 17 minutes after Andy Wilkinson was sent off for the visitors. Defeat leaves Portsmouth further stranded in 20th place. This match followed the announcement that the Premier League had rejected Portsmouth's request to be allowed to sell players outside the transfer window to raise much-needed funds. It was curious to see what effect that would have on a side that, quite literally, does not know if it is coming or going. Having beaten Southampton 4-1 in their previous fixture, the home side should not have been lacking too much confidence and indeed they began in sprightly fashion. But it was Stoke who had the first chance on goal. On four minutes, Glenn Whelan curled in a free-kick from just outside the Portsmouth's area and having climbed higher than anyone else, Ryan Shawcross sent a header towards goal that drifted marginally over the bar. The contest then settled into an even affair with neither side able to impose itself on the other. Indeed, it took another 13 minutes for another meaningful attempt on goal. Again it fell to the visitors, although again it led to little of note as Mamady Sidibe dragged his shot from inside the area wide of the post. Portsmouth finally threatened on 23 minutes and will feel aggrieved it did not lead to the opening goal. Quincy Owusu-Abeyie fed a cute through pass to Piquionne, which the Frenchman lifted over Thomas Sorensen and into the back of the net. The effort was immediately ruled out for offside, although replays showed the 31-year-old was being played onside by both Stoke's full-backs, Wilkinson and Danny Collins, when he collected the ball. But it did not matter, as only 10 minutes later, Piquionne did score. The striker reacted quickly after Sorensen had failed to hold Owusu-Abeyie's stinging long-range drive and from a tight angle side-footed the ball into the net. Piquionne did not return after the interval and was replaced by Kanu. The veteran striker came into a team that had survived two promising chances that came the way of Stoke's Turkish forward Tuncay Sanli right at the end of the first-half. That proved to be a warning as on 50 minutes the visitors equalised after Robert Huth headed in Whelan's corner from the right. The German defender was allowed to rise over his marker Marc Wilson with ease. The equaliser did not crush Portsmouth and they remained firmly in the game. Saying that, they were struggling to create clear chances, with Kanu showing little of the dynamism and cutting edge that had characterised Piquionne's display. Portsmouth sensed they could retake the lead after Wilkinson was sent-off on 73 minutes having received two yellow cards from the referee Mike Dean, both for grappling with Aruna Dindane, but instead they were caught by Diao's late sucker-punch. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Glenn Duggan, Observer reader From my point of view, we just weren't good enough today. This game was indicative of our whole season. Avram Grant made some tactical errors and just should have gone all out for victory. He put Dindane on the left when he knows he is good in the box. We lacked quality and tended to overcomplicate matters. We had five forwards in the end but why was Utaka told to get in the box instead of Kanu? In the end we were done by two Portsmouth old boys, Fuller and Diao. Portsmouth bookmakers have paid out on the club being relegated, but I think we are looking at administration. These are bad times at Fratton Park. The fan's player ratings James 6; Finnan 6 (Webber 86 n/a) Wilson 6, Hreidarsson 5, Belhadj 8; Diop 2; Dindane 7, O'Hara 5, Yebda 5 (Utaka 66 5), Owusu-Abeyie 7; Piquionne 7 (Kanu ht 6) Chris Baldwin, Observer reader This game looked like it could go either way for long parts of the game. Portsmouth were playing for their lives and we had to defend well in the first half. Diao's goal was his first in eight years so that was something to celebrate. The sending-off was very harsh and Pulis was right to lose it on the touchline. It was a very good three points against a side that are on the way out. But we couldn't let that effect us and in the end Fuller and Diao were clinical. We are safe in the league now and now it is case of how much further we can go. We have still got the FA Cup run, which is great, but it's the league that gives you kudos and we are going nicely in that.
