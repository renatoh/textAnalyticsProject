Question: This North American mystery bird's taxonomic family belies it preferred habitat type: what might that be? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult male ladder-backed woodpecker, Picoides scalaris, a species that specialises in arid and semi-arid habitats: wooded canyons, cottonwood groves, pine and pine oak woodlands, desert scrub, and desert grasslands dominated by mesquite. These insectivorous birds are found from the southwestern U.S. through Honduras in Central America. There is a small disjunct population in eastern Nicaragua. Despite being widespread, its populations are declining. These small woodpeckers are well-adapted to their desert habitats, and are able to live and breed whilst consuming insects and their larvae on the otherwise slim picking that larger woodpeckers couldn't survive on. That said, they will supplement their diet with cactus fruits, when available. Here's a video of a male ladder-backed woodpecker extracting insects from the thick bark of a pine tree in Santa Fe, New Mexico (video uploaded 20 April 2011): Visit ontology's YouTube channel [video link]. All woodpeckers are placed into the taxonomic family, Picidae. The picids are found everywhere in the world except Madagascar, Australia, and Antarctica. As their name implies, woodpeckers are arboreal birds that tend to live in wooded habitats. The ladder-backed woodpecker can be distinguished from several congeners: the range-restricted Nuttall's woodpecker, P. nuttallii, is noticeably darker; with narrower white stripes (especially below its eyes), white feathers at the base of its upper mandible, whiter underparts, and outer tail feathers with spots. The male has red only on the back of its head the smaller downy woodpecker is black with a distinctive white patch in the middle of its back, white underparts, no white streaks on its crown, and its black malar and eye stripes don't merge. All black and white patches are sharply defined. The male has a much smaller red patch on the back of its head You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.
