On Tuesday, the Walt Disney Company and Google severed ties with the 27-year-old YouTuber, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, after the Wall Street Journal highlighted the fact that he\u2019d posted several videos featuring antisemitic or neo-Nazi \u201cjokes\u201d, including one where he paid two men to hold a \u201cDeath to All Jews\u201d sign. Another video features a man dressed as Jesus saying: \u201cHitler did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d Kjellberg, who rose to internet fame making videos about video games, is angry that the Wall Street Journal referred to his antisemitic \u201cjokes\u201d as \u201cposts\u201d. \u201cThey take that and use it out of context to portray me as a Nazi,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sorry for the words I used as I know that offended people, and I admit that the joke itself went too far. I like to push boundaries, but I would consider myself a rookie comedian,\u201d he said. Kjellberg blames the Journal, rather than his comments, for the breakdown of his two biggest brand relationships, saying they took the out-of-context antisemitic \u201cjokes\u201d to Disney and YouTube \u201cobviously cornering them and forcing them to sever their ties with me\u201d. Kjellberg claims that the Wall Street Journal purposefully skewed his words because it and other mainstream media outlets feel threatened by him. \u201cOld-school media does not like internet personalities because they are scared of us. We have so much influence and such a large voice, and I don\u2019t think they understand that,\u201d he said. The story, he said, \u201cwas an attack towards me by the media to try and discredit me, decrease my influence\u201d. The videos in question have made PewDiePie popular with neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, which has run a series of articles about the YouTuber, describing him as \u201cour guy\u201d. \u201cHe could be doing all this only to cause a stir things up and get free publicity,\u201d wrote the Daily Stormer. \u201cUltimately, it doesn\u2019t matter, since the effect is the same; it normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies.\u201d Responding to the support from neo-Nazis, Kjellberg said: \u201cI do not support the hateful groups in any way.\u201d Kjellberg, who has more than 53 million subscribers on YouTube, explained that his relationship with mainstream media has soured over the years as he has become more successful. \u201cThey blatantly represent people for their personal gain, they even viciously attack people just to further themselves,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t like the fact that reports focus on how much he earns (estimated to be more than $12m in 2016). \u201cThe money is all I\u2019ve ever been acknowledged for. I literally raise millions of dollars for charities. That\u2019s rarely ever spoken about,\u201d he said. He said that he has started to fight back against the mainstream media but \u201cthe more I punch back, the more I get back\u201d. He concluded his video on Thursday with a message to the Wall Street Journal: \u201cI\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still making videos. Nice try, Wall Street Journal. Try again, motherfuckers!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
