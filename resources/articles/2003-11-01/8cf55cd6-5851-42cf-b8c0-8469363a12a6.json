I goggled at him. We were sitting in the dining room of the Gostilna Breza, a family-run restaurant in the little town of Kobarid in western Slovenia. Ocvirkovca, the bread, which he was tearing up so delicately before popping into his mouth, was wrapped in coils like a turban and flecked with porky scratchings baked into it. The remains of a bowl of ajdovi zganci z ocvirki, a kind of buckwheat porridge, which seemed to have the specific gravity of gold, also souped up with porky scratchings, sat before us on the table. And we had already fought our way through jesprenj v kruhovi skodelici, a thick barley soup with slices of ceps in the bread cup, krompir s skuto - fresh cheese crunchy with little nuggets of walnut with boiled potato on the side; prsut (wind-dried ham); and divjacinska salama, or game salami. And that is not to mention the small regiment of bottles lining up on the table - peneci teran (a slightly astringent, refreshing, delicious sparkling red); teran (red wine from Kras) ; and two cuv\u00e9es of merlot from Goriska Brda. If this was Slovenia's take on Mediterranean food, it was as eccentric as the diet based on fish and vegetables sluiced in olive oil for which health professional and lifestyle gurus proselytise so vigorously in the UK. In fact, it all seemed a good deal closer to the culinary traditions of the Austro-Hungarian empire to me, which would not be entirely surprising as Slovenia had spent a good chunk of its history as part of the last great pan-European empire (if you don't count the European Union). Slovenia tends to be lumped with the Balkan states - Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia and Macedonia - but, in spite of having a recent shared history with some of them as part of Tito's Yugoslavia, its people think of themselves as rather different. And, as they ready themselves to enter the EU next May, the country is certainly in a better position than some of its neighbours to take advantage of the wider market. The towns and villages that I saw - Bovec, Tolmin, Most na Soca as well as Kobarid - exuded a self-effacing prosperity. They were strung out along the clear, trout- and grayling-crowded waters of the Soca, Idrija, Baca, Tolminka rivers, which tumbled through rocky gorges that cut off the Julian Alps on the border with Italy. This is a part of the world that seemed to have changed little since before the first world war. The vertiginous hillsides were covered in thick woods of deciduous trees - beech, oak, ash, alder, horse chestnut, hazel - home to lynx, bears, wolves, and, on the higher, barer reaches, chamoix. Meadows cleared from the surrounding woodland were studded with pale purple wild autumn crocuses and chalky blue scabious. Although, as Redez explained, the small, traditional farms have largely disappeared, except on the high mountain plateaus where heavy subsidies are needed to support them, the impression to the casual tourist is that the Slovenes still care passionately about their food and its provenance. There were orchards of apple, pear and walnut trees; sturdy russet cows, sheep with floppy ears and patchwork goats grazing in the meadows and geese and turkeys strutting about the yards. But most notable of all, the front garden of each neat house, with its characteristic wide-pitched roof, was laid out to vegetables - beans, chard, leeks, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes and late chicories - in autumn. Pumpkin plants, with orange/gold fruits the size of beach balls, straggled through the orderly rows There were flowers - chrysanthemums and marigolds, and geraniums in window boxes - but vegetables took pride of place, as they did on the table. Cabbage turned up in a classic sauerkraut with sausage combination, kislo zelje s klobaso, roast lamb was paired with chicory and mashed potato, as in peceni jancek s stokado, and then there was the gob-smacking, rib-sticking, tub-thumping frika that was served to us one evening in a wayside inn. This was a pie, the base and top formed of sliced potatoes, and the middle of rich, oozing, gently pungent Tolminka cheese. Coming before a plate of grilled meats (kebabs are a reminder of Slovenia's ancient association with the Ottoman empire and the cooking of the Middle East), which constituted a regular menu item almost everywhere, you didn't want much more. I could have done without the meat, to be truthful. Such traditional dishes weren't always immediately apparent on the menus of those restaurants and inns most readily pointed out to visitors. Here, the menus seemed to veer between distressingly dreary pizza and basic grilled-meat-and-salad. That said, the grilled meats were of good quality, the salads copious and the prices cheap. Nor was it unusual to come across platters of superb cured meats and salamis by way of a first course. Sadly, however, we never managed to come across pecen prasicek - suckling pig - with which my more experienced fellow travellers had tempted me so cheerily beforehand. There were, however, other compensations. Each day, we shopped in the little supermarket in Most na Soca, which was about the same size as a British minimarket. But size was about all they had in common. Wholewheat bread - kmecki temni kruh, anin kruh and jelenor - was outstanding. There were a dozen or so species of sausage, from the soft, squidgy cepleska klobasa to the dense, chewy bloska klobasa. There were smoked pig's feet in vacuum bags and pork belly and sachets of pork fat flecked with meat. There were very fine apples and grand cabbages. There was a deli counter piled high with prsut, yet more sausages and Tolminka cheese. Bread, sausage, cheese and beer from the excellent Union or Zlalovog breweries made our lunch each day. Such food, eaten in the shade of walnut trees on the banks of some of Europe's most beautiful and unspoilt rivers, took on a magic of its own. But it was lucky for us that Redez took us under his awesomely well-informed wing (he is a regular Economist reader and browser of British newspapers via the web). He said that it was usually possible to try out traditional dishes, and, as chairman of the local tourist authority as well as chairman of the fishing club, he was in a position to know. Indeed, there is a network of restaurants in Kobarid dedicated to Slovene cooking. It was simply a matter of ordering the dishes a few days in advance. And he had ordered two examples of struklji, the pudding glory of Slovenia: kobariski struklji and volarski struklji, from Kobarid and Volarje, respectively. They were as ample as all the other courses had been, but their soft pastry casings and fillings of walnuts and raisins and other ingredients I could not identify, were subtle and soothing and curiously edible, even at the end of our mighty Mediterranean dinner.

Zganci - a matter of taste 1.5 lb buckwheat flour 0.75 litre of salted boiling water A few tablespoons of lard with cracklings (garnish) Roast the buckwheat flour (according to the Koroska style) in an ungreased iron pan until the aroma appears, stirring constantly. Pour the salted boiling water over the flour and continue stirring until small zganci begin to form. Cover the pan and place over very light heat for 10 minutes so that flour swells. Brown cracklings in lard and use to garnish zganci. \u00b7 Another way to prepare zganci is to pour buckwheat flour into salted boiling water, and after boiling five to 10 minutes, make a hole in the pile of flour with the handle of a wooden spoon so that the pile cooks from the inside as well. Continue boiling for another 15 minutes. Pour off half the liquid and save. If you wish small zganci, stir with two-pronged fork and garnish in the pot. For softer zganci in the Styrian (Stajerska) style, add some of the saved liquid and stir with a long wooden spoon until smooth. Scrape zganci from spoon with a fork into a bowl and garnish to taste."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
