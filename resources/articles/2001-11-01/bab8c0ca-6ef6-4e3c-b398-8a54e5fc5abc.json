Things have changed. The 45th event, which we must now call the Regus London Film Festival after the chief of its 38 sponsors, began with pickets from the British Film Institute braving the rain at the gala opening in Leicester Square to protest at their shabby treatment at the hands of the management. In this celebrity conscious time the B-list (or possibly C-list) guests were shepherded towards a side door of the Odeon and past a boarded-off section where corporate hospitality was being dispensed. On stage the BFI chairman, Joan Bakewell, declared this to be the biggest and best festival to date - the former claim with some 200 features on display being more easily verified than the latter. The chosen gala movie was 75-year-old Robert Altman's Gosford Park, a picture largely financed by the British Film Council which also pays for and controls the BFI. Is this an example of profitable synergy or a conflict of interests? The redoubtable Altman brought on stage his co-producer, screenwriter and 32 members of the cast to demonstrate his contribution to our local employment situation. Gosford Park proved an elegant if overlong entertainment, set in 1932 at an English country house shooting party, featuring a rally of vintage automobiles and most of the British acting profession, credited alphabetically from Alan Bates to James Wilby. The film starts like a lite version of Renoir's La R\u00e8gle du Jeu. But 75 minutes in, following the murder of the host - a lecherous industrialist (Michael Gambon) despised by his aristocratic guests -it switches into a socially conscious Agatha Christie whodunit. Altman has often spoken of his interest in family life and of his large casts as resembling extended families, and his acerbic, view of the world brings to mind George Orwell's comment on the England in which this film is set - 'a family with the wrong members in control'. Gosford Park is perhaps the accomplished doodling of an Old Master rather than Altman at his best. But it's highly enjoyable and it's a pleasure to watch the deft movement of the camera gliding upstairs and downstairs through the grand house, moving dextrously from character to character. There are also marvellous performances from, among others, Maggie Smith as a vicious, exploitative countess, Helen Mirren as a tight-lipped housekeeper, and from Bob Balaban and Jeremy Northam as respectively a Hollywood producer and the matin\u00e9e idol Ivor Novello, outsiders who comment on the action. The festival will be running in numerous London venues until 22 November, when a selection of pictures will start touring the regions. Because of its size the festival doesn't have a critical focus the way Cannes does with its 20 films competing for the Palme d'Or, though the Sutherland Trophy, which used to go to the best film premiered during the year at the NFT, is now given to the best debut movie shown in the festival. Possibly the time has come to consult the ghosts of festivals past, re-consider the scale, and have a relaunch. Meanwhile, to strike a positive note, there is much worth seeing, starting with screenings this afternoon (5.45pm) and tomorrow (12.45pm) at the Odeon West End of Pollock, actor-director Ed Harris's ambitious biopic of the self-destructive painter. \u00b7 Harris will be discussing his work in a Guardian lecture tomorrow evening (6.30pm) at the NFT"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
