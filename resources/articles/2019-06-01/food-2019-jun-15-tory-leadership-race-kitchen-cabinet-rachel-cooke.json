As I write, only Dominic \u201cI am not a feminist\u201d Raab has let us into his: an eerily pristine pastel number that brought to mind the set of a low-rent farce in a theatre where the budget is too small for decent props. But if the other candidates behave as politicians tend to do at these moments \u2013 from Thatcher on, they\u2019ve never been able to resist the temptation to try and make themselves look \u201cordinary\u201d (ie non-weird) by being seen to do a vigorous spot of washing up \u2013 it\u2019s possible that by the time you read this, we will at last know whether Andrea Leadsom ever did splash out on her very own pizza oven (\u201cLook, Laura, this mozzarella is actually from Hampshire \u2026\u201d). The kitchen on which I most longed to feast my eyes in the run-up to the MPs\u2019 vote was that of Rory Stewart, speaker of shopping-centre Dari and international adventurer extraordinaire. What can it be like, I wonder? I picture the kitchen-parlour at Dove Cottage in Grasmere: gloomy, low-ceilinged and all but dominated by the kind of temperamental range on which Dorothy Wordsworth once baked mutton pies (Stewart is the MP for Penrith and the Border, not far away; he\u2019s also known for his fondness for memorising poetry by heart). But perhaps this isn\u2019t hardcore enough. Maybe Rory likes to cook on a Primus stove when he\u2019s up north \u2013 or maybe he has dug a fire pit, over which a whole lamb might be spit-roasted. Such a thing could come in handy should the members of the Penrith Conservative Association ever try to deselect him. Or what about \u2013 my imagination\u2019s really running wild now \u2013 the haybox, an improvised bit of kit that is both green and very gung-ho make-do-and-mend? (In case you\u2019re wondering, preheated food is wrapped in hay, an insulating layer that enables it to continue slowly to cook). Stewart does bring to mind a certain kind of movie star \u2013 a little bit Valentino as Lawrence of Arabia; a little bit Richard E Grant as Withnail \u2013 and now I think about it, I recall that Alec Guinness was keen on hayboxes. His long-suffering wife Merula once revealed to a house guest that, unable to lay her hands on any hay, she\u2019d used a load of Alec\u2019s old underpants instead (the resulting osso bucco, according to the same guest, was somewhat underwhelming). Either way, I don\u2019t imagine there are great cairns of cookbooks round Rory\u2019s place. According to a profile in the New Yorker, his critics regard him as someone who goes in for \u201cflitting\u201d; while his enemies have only plans, he has ideas. You can just see him wildly throwing the chilli, sumac and fennel seeds into the pan, only to return to a lump of moderately fragrant charcoal some time later, having been unhelpfully distracted by the TS Eliot he was rereading. Beside such scenes, the possible delights of the Gove household, all \u201cwitty\u201d mugs and pointless arguments over the dishwasher, seem so pale and boring. Ditto the McVey kitchen, a realm in which I struggle to imagine much more than kitchen roll, frozen peas and emergency fish fingers, for all that Esther gamely shares her life with the \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d campaigner Philip Davies. (Davies, the MP for Shipley, has said that feminist \u201czealots\u201d want women to have their cake and eat it \u2013 but how can Esther possibly have time for baking when she\u2019s busy giving so many car-crash interviews?) Basically, I can\u2019t stop thinking about Stewart\u2019s un-abandoned ways with chicken legs, which is why the other week I wrote him a fan letter that I hope he will answer quite soon. Rory, whether you\u2019re still in the race or not when you read it, I will take you for lunch at the Afghan Kitchen in newly Liberal Democrat Islington, where the dal is the colour of sunflowers and the pickles are sharp and sweet. While we eat, you can show me a picture of your oven, and tell me all about your ideas \u2013 whether for stew, or world domination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
