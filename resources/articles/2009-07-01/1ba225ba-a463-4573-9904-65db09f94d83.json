Now with a new title (\"Symphonies\") and lyrics, it remains an inventive calling card, though the same can't be said for this debut album as a whole. Founded on bland, sugary R&amp;B grooves, too many songs drift by inconsequentially, while vocally, his tendency to whine grates. When he cuts loose, however, he can thrill: disco-funk workouts \"Yours\" and \"Pump My Pumps\" evoke nothing so much as an art-school Justin Timberlake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
