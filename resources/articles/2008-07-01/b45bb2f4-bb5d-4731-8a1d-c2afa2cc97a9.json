The Brazilian won the 2002 World Cup with his native country and took Portugal to the European Championship final in 2004 and the World Cup semi-finals two years later but had never managed a European club team. \"Chelsea gambled on my ability but I believe in myself,\" he said. Scolari says the fate of Grant, sacked after Chelsea came second in three competitions last season, does not worry him. \"I am not afraid of my job. All over the world coaches need to win competitions, not only in Chelsea.\" The 59-year-old denied that the European Cup would be the club's priority. \"My pressure is the desire to become world class, not just to win the Champions League,\" he said. \"If I say to my players that the Champions League is more important than another competition, I think the players might only prepare for the Champions League. I don't think that's the correct way to look at it.\" He also revealed that the club's owner, Roman Abramovich, had promised not to interfere with playing matters: \"I told him that when it comes to the pitch it is all mine, no one interferes. He was happy with that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
