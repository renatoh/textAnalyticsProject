While Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that Isis \u201cmust be destroyed\u201d, another US official said the horrific, recorded slaying had not changed US policy options for striking the jihadist entity that has overrun much of northern, western and central Iraq. Isis continues to entrench itself within Sunni areas of Iraq, making it difficult to dislodge them through the bombing options that the administration has embraced. Kurdish and Iraqi security forces, as well as cleavages between Iraqi Sunnis and Isis, remain the administration\u2019s hope to roll back the group that has redrawn the map of the Middle East. With some frustration, Obama administration officials consider their options against Isis to remain limited, despite widespread US public outrage at the killing of an American citizen who had been held as a hostage. Meanwhile, Isis has reportedly seized a dozen new villages north of Aleppo in Syria, providing it with greater strategic depth. Foley\u2019s killing has incensed the administration \u2013 President Barack Obama spoke about Isis on Wednesday with rare anger, calling it a \u201ccancer\u201d \u2013 but despite the intensified rhetoric, two officials indicated that future military action in Iraq was likely to be marked by more continuity than change. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing the operations within the missions of protecting US personnel and facilities, Iraqi critical infrastructure and the civilian population,\u201d said a US defense official. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, said Foley\u2019s murder \u201cleaves absolutely no doubt that [Isis] is committed to attacking Americans and our allies\u201d. Feinstein urged \u201ccoordinated and sustained action by Iraq, the United States and the international committee\u201d, terms she did not define in a Wednesday statement, to \u201creverse [Isis\u2019s] rise and eliminate this very dangerous terrorist threat\u201d. Obama pledged to be \u201cvigilant and we will be relentless\u201d against Isis, but stopped short of committing to the group\u2019s destruction, which Kerry subsequently did. US allies in Britain, France and Germany reacted with disgust at the Isis killings, raising expectations for a more concerted allied strategy against Isis after French President Francois Hollande suggested an international conference on the subject in an interview with Le Monde. A former senior Obama defense official, Michele Flournoy, tweeted Wednesday that the US \u201cneed[s] to lead an international effort to counter\u201d Isis, which she defined as \u201crolling back territorial gains [and] degrading their ability to launch attacks on western interests\u201d. One option under consideration, not directly related to the Foley killing, is a request for hundreds of more US marines to deploy to Baghdad to bolster security at the US embassy and related installations. The request, made by the State Department recently, is said not to be a response to an new anticipated push by Isis into Baghdad, which it has stopped short of attempting to seize. An official who was not cleared to speak to the press characterized it as coming out of an abundance of caution. Chuck Hagel, the US defense secretary, has yet to receive an internal recommendation on the merits of strengthening the Baghdad embassy. The requested marines are said not to have any combat function, commensurate with Obama\u2019s pledge not to reintroduce ground combat in Iraq. Since June, he has ordered hundreds of special operations \u201cadvisers\u201d back into the country. The US Central Command continued on Wednesday to send fighter jets and armed drones to harass Isis near the Mosul Dam, a critical piece of infrastructure that the US considers to no longer be under Isis control. The warplanes launched 14 strikes against Isis vehicles and weaponry, tacitly a rejection of Isis\u2019 demand with the Foley killing that the US relent in its newest air campaign in Iraq. The new strikes bring the total to 84 since 8 August, when Obama authorized a return of US combat aircraft to Iraqi skies. The vast majority, 51, have been aimed at breaking Isis\u2019 hold on the dam and nearby positions. Obama\u2019s critics in Congress consider the air strikes insufficient. Unlike Obama, many seek to expand the goal of US intervention to be Isis\u2019 destruction, but like Obama, none thus far have argued for the introduction of ground forces. \u201cThe president\u2019s current path of action has been far too limited to make a difference. We must do what is necessary to eliminate Isis, protect the innocent, and keep Americans safe,\u201d said Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican on the intelligence committee rumored to seek the chairmanship, an influential foreign-policy position. A question facing the administration is whether US military forces are able to save Steven Sotloff, another journalist held captive by Isis. The propaganda video showing Foley\u2019s execution threatened Sotloff would be next unless the US ceased its bombing campaign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
