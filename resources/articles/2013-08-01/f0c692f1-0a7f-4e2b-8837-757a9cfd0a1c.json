The Russian National Orchestra under its founding conductor, Mikhail Pletnev, delivered a seismic performance of Alexander Glazunov's The Seasons that culminated in an Autumn so musically boisterous it nearly blew the audience from their seats. Glazunov composed the piece in 1899 for the Imperial Ballet's choreographer Marius Petipa, who evoked the year's changes through allegorical figures \u2013 Snow, Zephyr, Bacchantes, Ear of Corn. The American director/choreographer/composer/singer/performer Meredith Monk describes On Behalf of Nature, her latest work, as \"a meditation on our intimate connection to nature... the fragility of its ecology and our interdependence\". As in The Seasons, Monk organises her material in episodes rather than by narrative, providing continuity and development through interweaving musical themes. However, her physical and musical evocations are less clear cut than the 19th century's structured certainties. Monk began her career in the free-forming 1960s, and there is a holistic quality to her blend of dance, drama and music. This is particularly striking in the way that she integrates the human voice as an instrument in its own right (along with percussion, wind, keyboard, strings) into the fabric of the performance. Vocalisations, including whoops, yells, yodels, clicks and hums, suggest birds and insects as well as human herders, farmers, celebrants. Rhythms and gestures are derived from animal as well as human movements \u2013 scuttling, stretching and jumping intersperse dancing, walking, sitting. The ensemble is magnificent: on-stage musicians integrate into movement sequences; dancers create soundscapes with their voices. Although some episodes have an unfinished, workshop feel, many are vivid: Monk herself performs an intense and moving solo, and a lyrical duet traces the life of a couple through three repeated poses, each accompanied by ever-more densely layered melody. Where artists a century ago confidently expressed nature in forms that commanded audiences' admiration, Monk gently encourages reflection and engagement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
