Children can be challenged to consider how the Egyptians of the past and present have obtained water for drinking and for their crops and livestock. The importance of the Nile cannot be over-emphasised, as it is the very life-blood of the country and worthy of detailed investigation. Flood plains Egypt was originally a narrow country, established on the shores of the river. The river was the only reliable source of water as rain was rare in this desert country. The Nile flooded each year, leaving a layer of mud in the fields alongside the river. A key event to the establishment of a calendar was the fact that some Egyptians counted the days between each flood and arrived at the idea of a year. The flooding made the fields very fertile. Therefore, many Egyptians worked as farmers. Only the sons of wealthy parents attended schools. Most children learnt skills and trades from their parents. Activity 1: the river and transport Investigate to find out how Egyptians travelled from one part of the country to another by use of the river. This should include the type of boats used and methods of propulsion, which could differ depending on the direction of travel. Use art work from ancient Egypt to discover what the boats looked like. What would have been the purpose of travel? What birds and animals could be found in and around the river? Were any of them of use to the people? Where does the river start? Is there anything unusual about the shape of the river before it meets the sea? SEN adaptations The emphasis should be on the use of boats and how local materials would have been used for their construction: wood and reeds. The children could draw boats based on observations of art work found in tombs and elsewhere as illustrated in reference books, on CD-roms and the internet. Extension activity Find out if there is any evidence of ancient Egyptians travelling outside their country and if so, what was the purpose of such travel? Activity 2: the river and time Use the pupils' resource page to find out more about the Egyptian calendar. You could also see calendar for more detailed information. Encylopaedias are also great sources of information and illustrations on this theme. SEN adaptations Learning about an alternative calendar may help in understanding our own, if constant reference is made to it. Compare the names and order of the months and seasons. Extension activity Design your own calendar. Decide on the names of the months, how many days in a week and month and how many months to have in a year. Will the calendar be based on the movement of the Earth around the sun and the moon around the Earth? Activity 3: the river and farming From research in books available in schools, CD-roms and the internet, find photographs of Egypt as it is now, including the Nile and also of ancient Egyptian pyramids, tombs and temples (about 100 high-quality medium format colour images are available at Photos of Egypt). Notice the desert nature of the landscape and consider where farming could be carried out. Also, what else could the landscape be used for? Were there any natural resources in the desert? SEN adaptations Compare the landscape of Egypt with the local environment. What differences are there? How might the weather be responsible for the differences? Extension activity Compile a short booklet encouraging people to visit Egypt as a tourist. List some of the attractions and include some drawings or other pictures. Activity 4: the river and wildlife Find out about the wildlife that lives in Egypt, especially around the only significant water source that exists - the Nile. Find out which creatures would be dangerous if you were to swim in the river. Are there also any dangerous creatures in the desert? Which animal can travel for long distances without drinking, and how? What are the uses of a camel? Which animals would be suitable for hunting for food? See if you can construct a food chain from the creatures found in and around the river. How was water moved from the river to the irrigation ditches? A useful internet source for photographs and information of the wildlife of the area is Wild Egypt. This covers crocodiles, snakes and coral in the Red Sea. SEN adaptations Keep the emphasis on either the camel or the crocodile. Both should hold the interest of the children and the children can be assisted with their research to find out the characteristics and lifestyle of the animal before drawing it. Extension activity Try to find out what sort of animal a dugong is. Where does it live? What does it look like? What does it eat? Is it endangered? Is it related to other sea mammals?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
