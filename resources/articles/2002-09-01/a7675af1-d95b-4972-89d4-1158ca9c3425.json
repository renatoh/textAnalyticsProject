It wasn't until he paid a $2,000 ransom that the kidnappers freed Mrs Varotini. Hours later she gave birth to a boy by caesarean section. It is stories like this that terrify Argentinians such as Sonia Sosa. \"I no longer go out at night and I am scared to take my eyes off my son in the park for a minute,\" says Ms Sosa, 31, a manicurist and single mother of a toddler. \"I am afraid that kidnappers will think I have money and snatch him because I dress him well.\" Last week kidnappers seized the 12-year-old grandson of a sweet-potato producer in the town of San Pedro, in Buenos Aires province. In a call to his mother, kidnappers demanded a ransom of $40,000, but later cut it to $28,000. As Argentina's economic crisis grinds into its fourth year, the country has been seized by a frightening spiral of crime and violence. Kidnapping, once rare, is commonplace. The victims, once only the rich, can be anyone these days. A poll by the justice ministry showed that 88% of the population of Buenos Aires believes they will be victims of crime. With unemployment at 22% and more than 53% of the population below the poverty line, lawlessness is rife. \"Everything these days makes me scared - the muggings, the kidnappings, the robberies - you name it,\" says Lilia Arellano, 54, a nurse. Juvenile delinquency has grown by 142% in the past four years. While the police will not reveal statistics for kidnappings, one gang alone is be lieved responsible for almost 200 this year. Many are \"express kidnappings\" - where criminals force their victims to go from cashpoint to cashpoint until their accounts are emptied, then release them. Desperation has fuelled crime, not to mention the belief that those who play by the rules seldom get ahead. \"The adolescent children of an unemployed father might conclude that he gained nothing by working all those years, so instead they turn to crime,\" says Professor Ernesto Schargrodsky, of the Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires. Another factor is that the police are overwhelmed, underpaid and, in some cases, implicated in the crimes. Police officers in Buenos Aires province, which has 14 million residents and much of Argentina's industry, earn about $170 a month. Last year, says the justice ministry, 1,800 of the 45,000-strong provincial force were suspended after being accused of irregularities or criminal acts. Three in every 1,000 officers have been convicted of a crime. Police officers were allegedly involved in one kidnapping that touched a nerve among Argentinians. Diego Peralta, a 17-year-old student, was seized on July 5 while on his way to school in a middle-class district of Buenos Aires, allegedly by men wearing police uniforms. Despite the payment of a $4,500 ransom, his corpse was found floating in a drainage canal five weeks later. When it emerged that a man accused of involvement in the kidnapping was claiming that two active police officers formed part of the gang, Peralta's angry neighbours threw stones at the local police station and set a car ablaze during protests. \"What causes the greatest anguish in Argentina is that people no longer know who they can trust,\" says Professor Mordechai Benyakar, a psychotherapist at the University of Buenos Aires. This sense of insecurity permeates almost all conversations, from upper-class suburban housewives discussing whether tinted car windows can foil robbers to labourers who say the run-down trains are ideal hunting grounds for thieves. \"I've never seen anything like it in all my years. No place is safe any more,\" says Horacio Santas, 52, the co-owner of a sweet shop. \"We live like prisoners in our own homes while the thieves run loose.\" Meanwhile President Eduardo Duhalde is looking for a way to boost the police presence in Argentina at a time when there are twice as many private security guards at businesses as there are officers on the street. A proposal to draft border guards into Buenos Aires to beef up security is being considered, and police have set up checkpoints along the city's main roads to discourage crime. It has also become more dangerous to be a police officer. A study by the thinktank Nueva Mayoria has revealed that every four days a police officer is shot in Buenos Aires province - a 10% increase from last year and a 59% increase over the year before. If a hoped-for loan from the International Monetary Fund comes through soon, analysts believe the economy might begin to recover, bringing sorely needed jobs. Argentina defaulted on its $141bn debt last December and has been struggling to regain the IMF's confidence since. The devaluation of the peso in January is making Argentinian products more competitive in world markets, and an increased demand could result in more jobs. Yet there is little hope that this will bring a corresponding reduction in the crime rate. \"The economy may reactivate, but part of the increased crime rate is going to stay,\" Prof Schargrodsky says. \"These criminals already have a record and just cannot go back to the normal economy - besides, they would never earn the same kind of money.\""}, "isHosted": false}}}
