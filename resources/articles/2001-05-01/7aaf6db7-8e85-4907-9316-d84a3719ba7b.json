I call them events rather than concerts deliberately - the festival has a solid reputation for high-mindedness, but had they been thinking of solely musical considerations, they would have put this programme on somewhere else. True, the abbey is an unusually inspiring setting. After leaving the mouths and instruments of the performers, the strains of Handel and Bach floated around Handel's memorial, bounced past Poets' Corner, wafted up to the stained glass windows still lit by the evening sun - and then descended to the ears of the audience as a sumptuous sludge of noise. This mausoleum of the great and the good is just too resonant, too cavernous to allow the detail inherent in this kind of music to be heard. Unsurprisingly, it was the most dramatic moments that came over best: the opening lines of Handel's Dixit Dominus and, in the same piece, the Juravit Dominus, with its dramatic choral declamations. The men of the Westminster Abbey choir enunciated clearly, and there were some well-defined passages from the boys. But that clarity was not always maintained. There was the occasional ensemble problem, for example with the intertwining pairs of flutes and oboes d'amore at the opening of Bach's cantata Liebster Gott, wann werd' ich sterben. The conductor, James O'Donnell, the abbey's organist, needed to encourage yet more precision along with cleaner, more exaggerated contrasts in volume. And why open a festival that this year is devoted to vocal music with a Handel concerto grosso, one of the few instrumental pieces in the whole programme? Of the five solo voices, only Carolyn Sampson's unfussy soprano seemed to find a home in the abbey's vaults. Her fellow soprano, Sophie Daneman, overdid her phrasing so that quieter notes almost disappeared and, despite refined contributions from Susan Bickley and Michael George, all the soloists were at the mercy of the acoustic. Judiciously placed microphones probably made Radio 3's live broadcast the best way to hear this; for those of us in the abbey, it was something to be experienced as a package rather than listened to in detail."}, "isHosted": false}}}
