Carlo Ancelotti's frontline selection raised eyebrows, with the elusive skills of Salomon Kalou paired with Fernando Torres while Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka, more pacy and powerful, were relegated to the bench. The difference in the two teams' attitudes was clear when looking at the defensive midfielders. Michael Essien found room to initiate attacks as well as break them up. He may not be as defensive-minded as Mikel John Obi but was able to break off Yaya Tour\u00e9 and make a three-man midfield with Frank Lampard and Ramires. This was a big contrast to Nigel de Jong, who was stranded in his defensive work, locked in a straitjacket. Both sides gave licence to their full-backs to go forward and while the first-half passing was precise and accurate, they could afford to move forward safely. Aleksandar Kolorov, in the early play, advanced and crossed but crossed poorly. For Chelsea, Branislav Ivanovic had the same problem. On Chelsea's other flank Ashley Cole's raids were challenged by the workaholic James Milner, who was covering the stay-at-home Micah Richards. The first period lacked goal threat but there was some good link play between the smooth-moving Kalou and the more sprightly looking Torres. City were solid at that stage with De Jong tackling forcefully and Vincent Kompany and Joleon Lescott reading the game expertly. When City went forward, however, they did not allow David Silva enough passing options to maximise his skill (see fig). Teams need to attack together and defend together. De Jong rarely moves forward whereas Essien broke forward when given an opportunity in a similar position for Chelsea. City were too nervous to leave the defensive areas. Gareth Barry has more licence to move forward but when he attempts to go on the attack in the team's interest he finds difficulty in recovering his ground if and when possession changes hands. Two sitting players in front of a four-man backline give opportunities for full-backs to exploit the width, comfortable with the security they have got behind them. But Micah Richards failed to make inroads, partly because he was well-policed by Florent Malouda and Cole. His powerful energy never caused Chelsea a problem. Mancini reacted only when going a goal down whereas Ancelotti made his changes while in the ascendancy. Territorially Chelsea monopolised the ball in the second period but could not produce an outstanding chancesinvitation for a forward to score. It took the enthusiastic David Luiz, from Didier Drogba's set piece, to arouse any ambition from City. It was too late and as the game opened up, City looked more vulnerable. Ramires' feet twinkled as he finished adroitly. It was a fair ending. City's philosophy is too heavily weighted towards \"what-we-have-we-hold\". With more attacking intent they might maximise their heavy outgoings. They have no need to be cautious. The combination of Barry and De Jong is a defensive luxury and in the end Chelsea's ambition beat their caution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
