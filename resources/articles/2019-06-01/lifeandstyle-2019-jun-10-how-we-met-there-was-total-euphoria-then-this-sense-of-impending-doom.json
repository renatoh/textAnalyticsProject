My heart stopped\u2019", "bodyText": "Of the upwards of 3,000 letters that Paul and Monika wrote to each other, many survive. Paul shows the box crammed with missives he received from Monika, which are what he has left after his mother moved house; Monika\u2019s mother has \u201cprobably five sacks\u201d. They met in 1973, when they were 16, when Paul was on a school exchange in Germany. For six years, they wrote to each other every day. \u201cA day without a letter was a bad day,\u201d says Paul. The postal service wasn\u2019t always reliable, says Monika, \u201cso sometimes there wouldn\u2019t be a letter for three days and I\u2019d think: \u2018Ah, he doesn\u2019t love me any more.\u2019 I\u2019d listen out for the postman and, if I could hear something, I\u2019d rush down and there would be eight letters and it was all right after all.\u201d For Paul, it was a battle between he and his dog as to who could reach the post first when it landed on the mat. Monika remembers the moment she saw Paul, as they crossed on the stairs between classes. \u201cI\u2019d never had this feeling before \u2013 and fortunately never after,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw this guy with these incredibly blue eyes. My heart stopped.\u201d Paul laughs: \u201cOh no, come on!\u201d \u201cIt did,\u201d says Monika. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d Paul remembers sitting behind her in French class, \u201cstaring at the back of her head and dreaming\u201d. They got together at a friend\u2019s party, when Paul plucked up the courage to ask Monika to dance. At first, she turned him down, but by the end of the night they had slow-danced together. From then on, they were a couple. \u201cWe had two very intense months together, very happy months,\u201d says Monika. \u201cBut as it got nearer to the end of his trip, he became increasingly sad.\u201d That was characteristic of their relationship, says Paul. \u201cThere was always this anticipation, then total euphoria at time spent together, then this sense of impending doom.\u201d They would try to see each other every school holiday, with flights paid for with Saturday jobs and birthday money; the longest they were apart was six months. Paul would save 5p pieces for the phone box for their monthly conversation, but daily letters were mostly how they kept in touch. At university, as they grew apart, Monika ended their relationship. \u201cJust before my finals \u2013 thanks,\u201d says Paul. \u201cThere was very little acrimony, but certainly a sense of loss. We went our separate ways for two and a half years, which is plenty of time to get into serious relationships that could have lasted a lifetime, but for the fact that in the background was always \u2026\u201d \u201cThere was always something missing,\u201d finishes Monika. \u201cAs we always say now, we got divorced before we got married,\u201d says Paul. \u201cWe know what it\u2019s like to live without one another.\u201d Later, mutual friends in Paris invited them to stay. \u201cWe spent the days arguing furiously, recriminations flying in the Jardin du Luxembourg,\u201d says Paul. \u201c\u2018People must have wondered what on earth was going on. But making up in the evenings was more than worthwhile.\u201d Within days, they were making plans for Monika to move to the UK. She did, for a while, until she was offered a job in Germany. They both moved and have stayed since \u2013 their two children went to the school where they met and even had some of their same teachers. They set up a translation business, which means they spend nearly all their time together. Friends ask how they do it, says Monika: \u201cI say sometimes I think we\u2019ve still got some catching up to do.\u201d \u201cWe still discover new things about each other, even now,\u201d adds Paul. What will they do with all those letters? \u201cThey\u2019re intimate letters and I wouldn\u2019t really want anyone to see them,\u201d says Monika. They don\u2019t think they will pass them on to their children. \u201cThey would probably laugh and blush,\u201d says Paul, \u201cand then set fire to them.\u201d That is what she and Paul should probably do, says Monika. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away the memories.\u201d Want to share your story?
