And yes, it's humiliating. A healthy majority of 66 was turned into a 31-vote defeat in tonight's key vote on the terrorism bill. Tony Blair, a prime minister who possesses huge persuasive skills, could not convince enough MPs to back an increased limit of 90 days on the detention of terrorism suspects without charge, even with the vocal support of the chief constables. Worse than that, the government had to back the 28-day option called for by the Conservatives rather than their own fallback position of 60 days. No wonder Mr Blair was seen shaking his head in disbelief as he left the Commons chamber. His own authority and powers of persuasion are now in question. Charles Clarke, his own home secretary, wanted to compromise on Monday but was stopped by Mr Blair. That decision now looks questionable. Is there any comfort for Mr Blair tonight? Well there is now a consensus on 28 days detention that the House of Lords will probably back. It's double the length of time the police had previously. Also, Mr Blair has managed to put his party (minus the 41who rebelled obviously) on the side of the police only months after the worst terrorist incident in British history. Should another attack occur, as the security services claim is inevitable, will the public forgive the MPs that went against police advice? He might not have the MPs on his side, but, according to the polls, he has the general public."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
