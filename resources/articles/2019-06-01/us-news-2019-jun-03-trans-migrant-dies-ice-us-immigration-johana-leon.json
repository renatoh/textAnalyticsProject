Johana Medina Le\u00f3n, a 25-year-old asylum seeker from El Salvador, died on Saturday at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, after she was detained for over a month and complained of chest pains, officials said. Leon had repeatedly pleaded for medical help and was held in poor conditions, advocates who had contact with her and others at the privately run New Mexico detention center said. Leon\u2019s death echoes the case of Roxsana Hern\u00e1ndez, a trans Honduran woman who had HIV and died in Ice custody one year ago. Hern\u00e1ndez died due to dehydration and complications related to HIV, according to her family\u2019s attorneys. The tragedy sparked international outrage about the US government\u2019s treatment of trans migrants fleeing violence and seeking asylum. \u201cIt\u2019s painful and gut-wrenching,\u201d said Isa Noyola, deputy director of the immigrant rights group Mijente, who has visited the Otero county processing center where Medina Le\u00f3n was detained. \u201cIce is wreaking havoc inside our detention centers \u2026 They are in the business of making people unhealthy and violating human rights.\u201d Immigration officials first encountered Medina Le\u00f3n on 11 April at the Paso del Norte port of entry, by El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. She was transferred to Ice custody, and she passed her first interview in the asylum process a month later, with authorities determining she had \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution if forced to return to El Salvador, Ice said in a statement on Monday. Medina Le\u00f3n, who advocates said was also known as Joa, was transported to a medical center on 28 May from the processing center where she was being held, complaining of chest pains, and was released on parole, according to Ice. She died four days later, though officials have not released a cause of death. Medina Le\u00f3n had requested to be tested for HIV and tested positive, according to Ice\u2019s statement. The Otero processing center, run by a private firm called Management and Training Corporation (MTC), has been the subject of a range of civil rights complaints over the years. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has accused the center of lacking adequate medical and mental healthcare, and alleged that trans and queer detainees suffer from harassment, abuse, discrimination and retaliation. Last year, the ACLU also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration\u2019s \u201carbitrary detention\u201d of asylum seekers, targeting the Otero center on behalf of plaintiffs who had fled Mexico to escape cartel violence. Nathan Craig, a volunteer with a group called Advocate Visitors with Immigrants in Detention (Avid) in the Chihuahuan desert, has visited trans detainees at Otero, and told the Guardian he was aware of three other trans women currently at the facility. Although he never met Medina Le\u00f3n, he said other women reported that she appeared to be getting sicker and appeared to be losing weight during her detention. The women all experienced bouts of illnesses and colds, he added. \u201cThese are individuals who are fleeing persecution for being transgender. They\u2019ve already suffered some significant issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are fragile. They are vulnerable.\u201d Craig said some of the women had suffered mental health consequences due to discrimination, harassment and isolation. Some of the women are segregated and isolated under the guise of protecting them, added Margaret Brown Vega, another Avid volunteer. \u201cSolitary is used in an abusive way,\u201d Vega said. Although LGBT people in immigration detention made up 0.1% of the population in 2017, they accounted for 12% of victims of sexual assaults reported in Ice custody, according to government data. Trans women are regularly detained at all-male facilities, and Ice reported to Congress last year that nearly 40 trans people were placed in solitary confinement in 2017 \u2013 14 of them involuntarily, and 25 who requested it because being in general population was so unsafe. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they are not fit to meet the needs of trans and queer immigrants,\u201d said Emilio Vicente, communications manager with Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, about the detention facilities. His group had just coordinated a week of actions in honor of the one-year anniversary of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s death when news of Medina Le\u00f3n\u2019s death broke. \u201cThese deaths are preventable,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThey were seeking asylum and instead they found death \u2026 Ice is not accepting any responsibility.\u201d Corey A Price, field office director for Ice enforcement and removal operations in El Paso, deflected blame for Medina Le\u00f3n\u2019s death in a statement, saying: \u201cThis is yet another unfortunate example of an alien who enters the United States with an untreated, unscreened medical condition.\u201d Ice further claimed that it provided \u201ccomprehensive medical care\u201d, including a \u201cfull health assessment within 14 days\u201d of entering custody. Activists said they were working to get in touch with Medina Le\u00f3n\u2019s family, and it was unclear if she had an attorney. Her death comes as the White House has dramatically escalated its attacks on trans rights, including new discriminatory policies in housing and healthcare, and the continuing military ban. \u201cIt\u2019s like reliving your nightmare over and over, and you can never get out of it,\u201d said Noyola, recounting the phone call she had received over the weekend about Medina Leon\u2019s death. \u201cWe have been in survival mode for so long with the daily transphobic attacks \u2026 But the community is not backing down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
