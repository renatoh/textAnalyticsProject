Nowell, who suffered a fractured eye socket last autumn, and Williams were both injured on international duty and missed England\u2019s final two games against France and Ireland, with ankle and tricep injuries respectively. Neither will feature for the Chiefs in the short term although Exeter\u2019s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, remains hopeful they will return for the closing stages of the season. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at weeks rather than months at this stage,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cHarry has a nerve-related weakness in his tricep but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too severe. We\u2019re also hoping Jack will still have a significant impact before the end of the season.\u201d Vunipola suffered a broken arm in January, having previously endured lengthy lay-offs after knee and shoulder surgery, but his hopes of a prompt return hang in the balance. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit uncertain,\u201d said Mark McCall, Saracens\u2019 director of rugby. \u201cBilly is in a race against time to be ready for the quarter-final. If the arm isn\u2019t right to play then we won\u2019t risk him. He\u2019s been injured enough, we don\u2019t want to re-injure him.\u201d Despite England\u2019s disappointing Six Nations campaign, calls for central contracts to ease the burden on the country\u2019s top players have been flatly dismissed by Premiership Rugby, with Baxter among those firmly against the idea. \u201cHow long have Ireland been centrally contracted and how many times have they had a season like this one?\u201d said Baxter. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a knee-jerk reaction to one year. If England go on to be dominant in next year\u2019s Six Nations and do well in the World Cup, no one\u2019s even going to be thinking central contracts. To come out with comments such as: \u2018It\u2019s up to the Premiership clubs to manage players better\u2019 is just naive. We spend 12 months managing our players the best we can. I seriously don\u2019t think where the players are now physically is down to the clubs at all. It\u2019s down to the extra burden that gets put on to international players, it\u2019s not because Premiership rugby players are lacking management.\u201d Baxter, whose table-topping side resume their league campaign at Bath on Friday night, also points out that injuries are an occupational hazard. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect guys to be playing high-level rugby and not pick up injuries. If there were five injured players coming away from every England camp you\u2019d be starting to talk about it. At the minute there\u2019s been an unfortunate set of circumstances.\u201d Exeter, meanwhile, will hear on Wednesday that their postponed Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Bath has been rescheduled for the Easter bank holiday weekend. Baxter has also paid tribute to his departing scrum-half Will Chudley, whose summer move to Bath has been confirmed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision to let Will go,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cHe\u2019s been a very important part of what we\u2019ve achieved here and he\u2019s one of the players I\u2019ve enjoyed coaching the most.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
