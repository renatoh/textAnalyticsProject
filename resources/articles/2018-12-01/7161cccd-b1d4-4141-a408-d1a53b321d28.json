Which isn\u2019t the kindest description when there will be supporters of Macclesfield Town who are very fond of this unpretentious little ground. But understandable, all the same, when you take into account the strangely lopsided stands, the matchstick floodlights, the confusing lack of symmetry and the fact the roof at one end is so low down the third\u2011floor residents of Mulberry Court, the block of flats next door, can see on to the pitch. A more generous description, perhaps, is that there is a lot more charm to be found at these kinds of lower-league grounds than some of the identikit bowls in out-of-town industrial estates higher up the football ladder. There is something rather endearing about the fact the pitch at Macclesfield has perimeter advertising boards for Mandarin House, a local Chinese takeaway, and the walls are lined with pictures of the team that beat Northwich Victoria to win the 1996 FA Trophy. The toast at the Silkmen Cafe is, as the menu promises, hot and buttery. The ale is served in Butch\u2019s Bar and though the club shop \u2013 no megastore here \u2013 had a sign saying it was open, the lights were off and the door was locked when I arrived for Sol Campbell\u2019s introductory press conference. Campbell pulled up a seat on the faded carpets of the McIlroy Suite. The hills on the horizon were a reminder of the beauty and wealth that exists in parts of Cheshire (never forget that Muttley McLad, lead singer of the Macc Lads, was actually called Tristan) and it was an unexpected bonus, behind one stand, to come across a workman in fluorescent orange scratching off the last remnants of a faded, barely distinguishable Manchester City sticker \u2013 the last reminder, possibly, from when the two sides played here in September 1998, amazing as it sounds now, on an equal footing in what is now League One. \u201cCity will have left the engine running on the team coach,\u201d as one match report snootily put it. Twenty years on, the two clubs are poles apart in every sense and, if Macclesfield are to pull off a feat of escapology from the bottom rung of League Two, their new manager will have backed up all his talk. Campbell, after all, has been telling us for quite some time that he will make a brilliant manager and that it is madness the rest of the football world cannot necessarily see it. If he can save the Football League\u2019s wooden-spoon club, his rhetoric won\u2019t open himself to quite so much ridicule (Exhibit A: referring to himself as \u201cone of the greatest minds in football\u201d). At least he will be able to supply the hard evidence that he was right \u2013 and that the industry should have given him his opportunity long before now. He is certainly an interesting character, Sol. Not everyone is entirely convinced, it is fair to say, and if we are being totally candid his braggadocio and occasional lack of humility makes it no surprise, football being the industry of schadenfreude, that the people wishing him well (this correspondent included) must be aware there are quite a few others who are rubbernecking in Macclesfield\u2019s direction to see if he falls flat on his face. Nor does he help himself sometimes, bearing in mind that jarring moment at Thursday\u2019s press conference when it became apparent that, no, we hadn\u2019t misheard him and, two minutes in, he was indeed congratulating Macclesfield for hiring a manager he described as previously being one of the greatest footballers in the world, as if it were perfectly normal to refer to himself that way. Or he wasn\u2019t aware, perhaps, that putting your international caps on the table didn\u2019t stop, say, Bobby Moore or Bobby Charlton \u2013 players from another level of greatness \u2013 from making lousy managers. That lack of self-awareness doesn\u2019t tend to go down well in the dressing rooms of League Two and is certainly an issue if my impression of Campbell is correct: that he doesn\u2019t necessarily realise how he comes across sometimes, that he is not the easiest man to read, or embrace, and that he might not have the skills set, judging from some of the stuff he comes out with, to leave any real sense that he is a natural team builder. When Campbell has argued in the past that he has been held back from management because of the colour of his skin he might have a very credible point when there is so much evidence of how much harder it is for someone with BAME background to be offered work. Yet there are others who will argue it is too simplistic in his case to believe the only reason he has been kept waiting is because he is black. And maybe there is something in that, too, when the industry is so gossipy and there are so many stories about his less attractive traits \u2013 arrogance, pomposity, self-entitlement, call it what you will \u2013 that might not sit well with potential employers. The latest example comes from Peter Crouch\u2019s new book and is about their time together at Portsmouth and Campbell\u2019s apparent habit of having two-hour massages until two minutes before every game. Portsmouth had two masseurs and Campbell would commandeer them both, one for each leg. Sometimes, the other players would complain. \u201cHe\u2019d raise his head briefly,\u201d Crouch writes, \u201cand look expressionless. \u2018When you\u2019ve got 70 caps for England, come back and talk to me again.\u2019\u201d Troy Townsend, of Kick It Out, wrote a supportive article for the Times on Friday to commend Campbell for his perseverance and strength of character. Even then, however, Townsend could not brush over the fact that one of the challenges for Campbell included \u201cpeople in football thinking you\u2019re just a bit odd\u201d. The time for example \u2013 and no apologies for repeating this one \u2013 when the then sports minister, Helen Grant, arranged a summit at Whitehall to discuss the lack of black managers and Campbell demanded an explanation from Dan Ashworth, the FA\u2019s technical director, about why Gary Neville had been fast-tracked through the system. Fair enough, but when Ashworth spoke favourably about Neville\u2019s work in the England setup the reply was a comedic: \u201cBut I am Sol Campbell.\u201d Ashworth tried to continue and, again, a hand went up. \u201cBut I am Sol Campbell,\u201d louder this time, more indignant. There are even anti-racism campaigners who can hear those five words and laugh at the tumbleweed floating across the room that day. And word gets around. Being perceived as odd might not stop someone from being a good football manager. It might, however, count against you in the selection process, especially when football clubs can attract 200-plus applicants for managerial vacancies. Ultimately, though, I hope Campbell makes a decent fist of it, bearing in mind we are coming up for 2019 and, rather pathetically, I find myself encouraged by the fact there are now eight BAME managers in the game. Eighteen months ago the figure was two \u2013 so small steps, and all that. But how absurd is it that eight out of 92 can feel like a minor breakthrough? The sport can hardly congratulate itself when there is still so much incontrovertible evidence \u2013 ignore the data and just use your eyes \u2013 that black managers do not get the same chances as white managers. Campbell has been kept waiting until the age of 44 (though, interestingly, he says he has applied for only 10-to-15 jobs over a seven\u2011year period) and, for a man widely accused of having a superiority complex, at least he has not turned up his nose about the idea of starting at the bottom. Since 1990 he is only the sixth black man to play for England and then go into management and if it doesn\u2019t work out for him at Macclesfield the harsh reality is that he should not expect another chance. According to the League Managers Association, almost two thirds of all the black managers who have passed through the Football League never get a second job. It is tough out there. Just not as tough, perhaps, for some of his former England colleagues. Neville went from England\u2019s ordeal at Euro 2016, as Roy Hodgson\u2019s assistant, to the top job at Valencia. Steven Gerrard has begun his managerial career at Rangers and Frank Lampard at Derby. Gareth Southgate started at Middlesbrough, Stuart Pearce at Manchester City and David Platt at Sampdoria. True, Tony Adams, Teddy Sheringham and Dennis Wise all set out in the lower divisions with Wycombe, Stevenage and Swindon but it is perfectly legitimate to wonder why the best Campbell could find, like Paul Ince before him, was Macclesfield, the 92nd-placed club in the country, and how long it might be before the diversity on the pitch, with 25\u2011to\u201130% of the players from BAME backgrounds, is even close to being matched in the dugouts. No time soon, can be the only conclusion. Wolves are ignoring the old golden rule: don\u2019t believe the hype There was always something faintly ludicrous about the way, half a dozen games into the new season, Phil Neville declared on Match of the Day 2 that Wolverhampton Wanderers were the best team to be promoted since the Premier League era began over a quarter of a century ago. A little research \u2013 a quick search of Wikipedia, nothing too onerous \u2013 might have informed Neville that Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle United finished third in 1993-94 and the Nottingham Forest side managed by Frank Clark did likewise the following year, both of them finishing above, among others, Arsenal and Liverpool. Two months on, it looks even sillier now Wolves have fallen into the bottom half of the table, with five defeats from their last six games, three successive losses at Molineux and not a single away fixture this season when they have managed more than one goal. The best promoted team of the Premier League era? It is not their fault a trigger-happy television pundit wanted to fluff them up so out of proportion, but there might be a case that some of the players have been seduced by the publicity. In one interview on Friday, before the 2-1 defeat at Cardiff, Matt Doherty said that Wolves had ambitions to win the Premier League within five to six years. Maybe so, but there is a PR rule that the top clubs tend to go by and it is very sensible: achieve first, then do your talking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
