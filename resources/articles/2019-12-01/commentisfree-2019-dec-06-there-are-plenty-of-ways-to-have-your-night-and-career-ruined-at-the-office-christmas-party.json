Much of the focus is (rightly) on sexual harassment and bullying. But there are plenty of other ways to have your night \u2013 and career \u2013 ruined. As the veteran of 147 jobs (truly), I have catalogued the way you can torpedo your career (or at least have regrets the next day) at the office Christmas party. Consider the future when you consider your costume Although on the outside you seem carefree, inside you are highly anxious, refreshing Twitter, dreading the \u201cMemories\u201d feature on Facebook. You are waiting to be called out. When are the photos going to resurface? The photos are from the 2011 office Christmas party. Things were different then! Standards were much looser, when \u201cwoke\u201d was a verb, not an adjective. The theme of the Christmas party was Dress as a Favourite News Story. It seemed like fun at the time. You meant no harm! I mean look at the others in the photo (which you keep hidden in a secret file on your computer marked \u201cExpenses\u201d). Your boss, carrying around an enormous rock on his back, is a trapped Chilean miner. Barry from HR is dressed as Pippa Middleton\u2019s arse \u2013 not Pippa Middleton the person \u2013 just her arse!! There\u2019s your colleague Amanda, wrapped in a blood-splattered sheet (Bin Laden\u2019s corpse). And you, you, I can\u2019t say what you wore but your work-wife is dressed as Boko Haram. There\u2019s video of her running around the party trying to kidnap all the junior girls from the office. A jump into politics has now been ruled out. You can never be part of public life. You could deny it\u2019s you under the balaclava, I suppose. But when you have Christmas parties now, you never, ever wear a costume. Look at me! Hey I know I am junior to you and right now cannot help you in any political, office-y way. But I am a person! One day I might be important! But even if I am not, I am STILL A PERSON. So when you are talking to me at the Christmas party, don\u2019t look over my shoulder, scanning the room for someone more important, so you can leave our conversation mid-sentence when I am telling you about driving my dad to chemo. I know you\u2019re scanning for someone more important. It sucks. I used to admire you and worked up the courage to talk to you, but now I think you\u2019re a dick. Look at me! Don\u2019t be the last to leave You\u2019re having so much fun. You don\u2019t know these people well \u2013 Sharon is from payroll and Sean has something to do with IT \u2013 but they are your new best friends, you\u2019re going to have lunch with them every week and have already told them about your taxi expenses scam and your work crush. They are so understanding and actually listen to you, not like your own team who left hours ago. Losers! You are going to kick on with your new best friends \u2013 Shereen and Dean \u2013 or whatever their names are; you are going to the only place open in Sydney at 3am: the CASINO! You are just going to have one last round (plus shots) and you are going to tell them again how much you love them, because you REALLY DO. Be careful of getting into Ubers with colleagues Chris lives right near you! You\u2019re leaving at the same time! Why don\u2019t you just split a ride? Sounds reasonable, but your colleagues don\u2019t see that you\u2019ve made a financial arrangement and saved $20. They see you leaving the party and going home with another colleague. They think instead of negotiating who to drop off first, you\u2019re actually asking \u201cYour place or mine?\u201d When people ask the next day if there was \u201cany gossip from the party\u201d, they will be getting high off the fumes of your unlikely affair (\u201cI\u2019ve never even seen them talk to each other, that\u2019s how careful they are!!!\u201d). Employer exclusion zone At the Christmas party, pretend your boss has an AVO (Apprehended Violence Order) out against you and you cannot approach within 30 metres of him or her. If you approach them, imagine getting tasered. Remember the last time you thought you\u2019d talk to your boss at the Christmas party? It all came out. How you didn\u2019t like him at first. How when he said that thing in the meeting you thought he was stupid. But how he\u2019s really getting there, he\u2019s really improved, and don\u2019t you think in light of the fact he\u2019s improved and you\u2019re giving him all this really great feedback at the Christmas party, you deserve a pay rise? In the words of the Fourth Wise Man, Ronan Keating: \u201cYou say it best when you say nothing at all.\u201d The bad-angle Facebook tagger Is there anything worse than waking from the office Christmas party, hungover, and finding you\u2019ve been tagged in dozens of photos posted on social media. There you are, in all your horrible glory: cross-eyed, triple-chinned and with one weirdly large hand. Of course she looks good \u2013 it\u2019s her photo! She probably deleted all the pictures where she had a chin that looks like a claw hammer, but where is her duty of care to you? Bring your own cigarettes There is only one smoker in your office, Gene, who everyone shuns because he stinks up the elevator and takes so many smokos that it\u2019s now like his work constitutes small breaks in his smoking regime. Yeah, Gene is generally hated. But not tonight! Everyone loves Gene because Gene has the smokes. And the party is full of people who are drunk and have regressed to their 20-year-old selves, their smoking selves. All over the party, there is only one conversation: \u201cYou got ciggies? Who\u2019s got ciggies? Gene\u2019s got ciggies? Where\u2019s Gene?\u201d Gene is already spending $250 a week on ciggies. Bring your own.
