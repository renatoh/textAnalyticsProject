It is not a \"bank\" in the common sense. It is one of the UN's specialised agencies, and is made up of 184 member countries. These countries are jointly responsible for how the institution is financed and how its money is spent ... In 2004 the bank provided $20.1bn [\u00a310.7bn] for 245 projects in developing countries ... The \"World Bank\" is the name that has come to be used for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association. Together these organisations provide low-interest loans, interest-free credit, and grants to developing countries. From the World Bank website, www.worldbank.org How is its president chosen? The US has traditionally filled the World Bank's top job as its biggest ... shareholder, while Europeans choose the head of the International Monetary Fund. James Wolfensohn, a Clinton appointee, failed to win support in the current administration for a third term. Anwar Iqbal, United Press International, January 7 Why did he fail to get that support? Mr Wolfensohn ... has made little secret of his desire to stay on ... [But the] Bush team generally concurs with critics who view his management style as erratic and often wasteful of bank resources. The administration has also clashed with him publicly over a number of issues, including the bank's effectiveness at providing aid. Paul Blustein in the Washington Post, January 4 Will his tenure be viewed unfavourably, then? He was the first president of the bank since the legendary Robert McNamara to show any aptitude for the job ... He has done much to dispel its one-time image as a financier of dams and other environmentally and socially questionable infrastructure projects in corrupt regimes run by tinpot dictators ... [And] yet the fact remains that the major borrowers of the developing world - China, India and even Brazil - no longer have any need of the bank's capital. Jermey Warner in the Independent, January 5 Who is his likely successor? Worldbankpresident.org ... lists possible candidates, including ... Bill Clinton and departing US secretary of state, Colin Powell, based on media reports, tips and names tossed around within the international lending community ... John Taylor, the US under-secretary of the treasury for international affairs, moved ahead as [the main] contender ... after the front-runner, the US trade representative, Robert Zoellick, was appointed to the state department. Lesley Wroughton for Reuters, January 11 Any other outside possibilities? Gordon Brown ... is, quite simply, the person best qualified in the world ... Mr Brown does not just have the intellectual smarts to lead the bank ... he has also shown a rare and genuine compassion for the poor, and has relentlessly bullied other finance ministries to forgive debt to developing countries and open their wallets to the destitute of the world. In every respect, he has the qualities that would make him a superb president, one who could lead the bank to a new level of global credibility. Michael Elliott in Time, January 24 What challenges does the new president face? The Meltzer commission [in 2000] recommended that the bank alter its aid model, creating performance-based grants instead of loans and an independent auditing system ... The Bush administration has made some progress in getting the bank to use grants instead of loans but ... independent auditing remains taboo. And this means that the grant system cannot work effectively. A new bank president could break that taboo. From an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, January 14 Any other changes needed? The bank, which ought to be structured like an aid agency, is structured like a bank, using \"profits\" from middle-income-country loans to subsidise technical assistance and aid to poorer countries. Someday ... these \"profitable\" middle-income-country loans may well blow up in its face, leaving the institution paralysed. The next bank president needs to find a way to put the bank on a more secure financial footing ... Then, ideally, it could pull out of the lending business. Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist of the IMF, in Newsweek, January 17"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
