Neither side came to terms with the conditions and a disjointed game was riddled with errors. Edinburgh earned no points for style but the result was more important than the manner of it and they got the win they needed. It turned out to be the Brendan Laney show as the centre bagged a personal tally of 19 points despite fluffing four kicks, including two sitters, mistakes that eventually saw him replaced as kicker. Edinburgh opened the scoring with a brace of penalties from Laney. Newport responded with a couple of their own from fly-half Jason Strange to tie the score at six apiece. With the wind in their sails Newport then missed a golden opportunity to turn the screws when Shane Howarth kicked a penalty over the try-line when aiming for a short lineout. Edinburgh then began to apply some control. They won a short-range lineout from a penalty and the ball was worked blind to the right wing where Laney was lurking for the score. The centre converted his own try and added a booming 50-yard penalty minutes later only for Strange to pull back three points with the last kick of the half to restrict the home side to a 16-9 advantage at the break. Edinburgh dominated after the break. A quick tap penalty by Mike Blair early in the second half gave the home side excellent field position. Two lineouts and a lot a grunting later saw Leslie rumble over for Edinburgh's second try. Another Laney penalty on 50 minutes kept the scoreboard ticking over. Newport should have been dead and buried when Canadian prop Rod Snow was sent to the sin bin but instead the Welsh side was inspired to their best rugby. Strange kicked his fourth penalty and the visitors managed to keep possession long enough to test the Edinburgh defence before another error halted their momentum. Duncan Hodge slotted a 70th-minute penalty before scrum-half Ofisa Tonu'u slipped over for a consolation try in the dying minutes. \u00b7 Olly Barkley gave Bath a flying start to their Parker Pen Challenge Cup bid when they crushed GRAN Parma 40-3 with a six-try salvo. New Zealander Aaron Takarangi scored two first-half tries that were enough for Ebbw Vale to win 20-16 at home against Montauban.
