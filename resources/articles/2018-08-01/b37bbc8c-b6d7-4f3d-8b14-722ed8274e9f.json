Bernd Leno will challenge Petr Cech in goal, while centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos and full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner will add experience at the back. Uruguay\u2019s Lucas Torreira and 19-year-old Matteo Guendouzi are intriguing additions in midfield. Jacob Steinberg In: Lucas Torreira Sampdoria, \u00a326.5m; Bernd Leno Leverkusen, \u00a319.2m; Sokratis Papastathopoulos Dortmund, \u00a317.7m; Matteo Guendouzi Lorient, \u00a38m; Stephan Lichtsteiner Juventus, free.

Bournemouth It was not straightforward but Eddie Howe eventually secured his No 1 target with Jefferson Lerma, the Colombia midfielder, joining for a club-record \u00a325m fee. The Cherries did not go wild this summer but in Levante\u2019s Diego Rico they have provided long-serving left-back Charlie Daniels with serious competition, while Howe can unlock the raw potential of David Brooks, the 20-year-old Wales international midfielder who joins from Sheffield United. Ben Fisher In: Jefferson Lerma Levante, \u00a325m; David Brooks Sheffield United, \u00a311.5m; Diego Rico Legan\u00e9s, \u00a310.7m. Out: Benik Afobe Wolves, \u00a310m; Lewis Grabban Nottingham Forest, \u00a36m; Max Gradel Toulouse, \u00a31.8m; Adam Federici Stoke City, undisclosed; Brad Smith Seattle Sounders, loan; Emerson Hyndman Hibernian, loan; Connor Mahoney Birmingham, loan. Brighton Chris Hughton focused on adding competition in defence, signing Leon Balogun and Bernardo after watching the pair impress in the Bundesliga, and Brighton also broke their transfer record to sign Alireza Jahanbakhsh from AZ Alkmaar. The Iranian winger scored 21 goals in the Eredivisie last season. It was a productive summer for the Seagulls, with full-back Martin Montoya arriving on deadline day. JS In: Alireza Jahanbakhsh AZ Alkmaar, \u00a317m; Yves Bissouma Lille, \u00a315m; Bernardo RB Leipzig \u00a39m; Florin Andone Deportivo, \u00a35.3m; Percy Tau Mamelodi Sundowns \u00a33m; Martin Montoya Valencia und; David Button Fulham und; Dan Burn Wigan, und (loaned back); Billy Arce CSD Independiente, und (loaned to Extremadura).

Burnley A fruitful final week eased Sean Dyche\u2019s frustrations after a difficult summer. The Burnley manager strengthened in central defence with Ben Gibson, added to his collection of England goalkeepers by ending Joe Hart\u2019s 12-year association with Manchester City and, while unable to re-sign Jay Rodriguez, secured the Championship\u2019s leading goalscorer from last season in Matej Vydra. Andy Hunter In: Ben Gibson Middlesbrough, \u00a315m; Matej Vydra Derby County, \u00a311m; Joe Hart Manchester City, \u00a33.5m. Out: Tom Anderson Doncaster, undisclosed; Scott Arfield Rangers, free; Chris Long Fleetwood, free; Dean Marney Fleetwood, free; Josh Ginnelly Walsall, free. Cardiff City Neil Warnock\u2019s early signings, a quartet who have excelled in the Championship, fit his mould of working with hungry players. They failed to lure Marko Grujic back from Liverpool and the deadline day arrivals of midfielders Victor Camarasa and Bournemouth\u2019s Harry Arter do not mask how light the newcomers are in terms of Premier League experience and firepower. BF In: Josh Murphy Norwich \u00a311m; Bobby Reid Bristol City \u00a310m; Greg Cunningham Preston \u00a34m, Alex Smithies QPR \u00a33.5m; Victor Camarasa Betis loan; Harry Arter Bournemouth loan. Out: Ben Wilson Bradford loan; Omar Bogle Birmingham loan; Lee Camp Birmingham loan. Chelsea Chelsea\u2019s summer was fraught and political, with recruitment delayed until Antonio Conte had left and Maurizio Sarri arrived. Jorginho will implement the new head coach\u2019s philosophy on the pitch. Thibaut Courtois\u2019 fractious departure was costly, with a world record fee required to secure Kepa, available for \u00a317.9m in January. Keeping Eden Hazard was key, but a penny for the thoughts of Ruben Loftus-Cheek over the loan signing of Mateo Kovacic. Dominic Fifield In: Kepa Arrizabalaga Athletic Bilbao, \u00a371.6m; Rob Green free; Jorginho Napoli, \u00a350.4m; Mateo Kovacic Real Madrid, loan. Out: Thibaut Courtois Real Madrid, \u00a335m; J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga Sassuolo, \u00a33.5m; Jonathan Panzo Monaco, und; Kenedy Newcastle, loan; Lewis Baker Leeds, loan; Eduardo Vitesse, loan; Trevoh Chalobah Ipswich, loan; Mason Mount Derby, loan; Jay Dasilva Bristol City, loan; Mario Pasalic Atalanta, loan; Todd Kane Hull City loan. Crystal Palace Money was tight at Selhurst Park, with a restrictive wage bill that restricted expenditure and hefty payments due to Liverpool for Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho. Losing Yohan Cabaye was a blow, and replacing Ruben Loftus-Cheek was awkward. So to bring in four players for an outlay of \u00a39.5m, plus wages, was impressive. Max Meyer has a point to prove, and Vicente Guaita was one of the best goalkeepers in Spain last season. DF In: Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 West Ham, \u00a39.5m; Vicente Guaita Getafe, free; Max Meyer Schalke, free; Jordan Ayew Swansea, loan Out: Yohan Cabaye Al Nasr, free; Damien Delaney Cork City, free; Jaroslaw Jach Rizespor, loan Everton Having spent most of the summer trying to reduce the wage bill and squad size, Everton went into overdrive on deadline day with three eye-catching signings. Brazil international Bernard arrived on a free transfer while a club delegation flew to Barcelona to complete deals for defender Yerry Mina and Andr\u00e9 Gomes, the latter on loan. AH In: Richarlison Watford, \u00a340m; Yerry Mina Barcelona \u00a327m; Lucas Digne Barcelona, \u00a318m; Jo\u00e3o Virginia Arsenal, undisclosed; Bernard Shakhtar Donetsk, free; Andr\u00e9 Gomes Barcelona, loan. Out: Davy Klaasen Werder Bremen, \u00a312m; Ramiro Funes Mori Villarreal, \u00a34.4m; Ashley Williams Stoke, loan; Kevin Mirallas Fiorentina, loan; Henry Onyekuru Galatasaray, loan; Shani Tarashaj Grasshopper, loan; Wayne Rooney DC United, free Fulham Fulham\u2019s business, on paper at least, looks hugely impressive. A squad bolstered by loanees last season appears to have been upgraded. Securing Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri from Nice was a coup, Alfie Mawson has aspirations to break into the England squad, while Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle is a World Cup winner. Aleksandar Mitrovic returns and five players, including full-back Joe Bryan, forward Luciano Vietto and Marseille midfielder Andr\u00e9 Frank Zambo Anguissa were signed on a frantic deadline day. DF In: Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri Nice, \u00a325m; Maxime le Marchand Nice, \u00a33m; Andr\u00e9 Frank Zambo Anguissa Marseille, \u00a330m; Aleksandar Mitrovic Newcastle, \u00a322m; Alfie Mawson Swansea, \u00a320m; Joe Bryan Fulham, \u00a36m; Fabri Besiktas, \u00a35m; Timothy Fosu-Mensah Manchester United, loan; Luciano Vietto Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, loan; Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle Dortmund, loan; Calum Chambers Arsenal, loan; Sergio Rico Sevilla, loan. Out: Ryan Fredericks West Ham, free; David Button Brighton, undisclosed; Tayo Edun Ipswich, loan. Huddersfield Town Three players who did well last season \u2013 Terence Kongolo, Florent Hadergjonaj and goalkeeper Jonas L\u00f6ssl \u2013 made loan transfers permanent. German World Cup winner Erik Durm has arrived to strengthen left-back. The question is whether Huddersfield have added enough creativity; much depends on how the young forwards Adama Diakhaby, Ramadan Sobhi and Isaac Mbenza perform. Paul Doyle In: Terence Kongolo Monaco, \u00a317.5m; Adama Diakhaby Monaco \u00a38m; Ramadan Sobhi Stoke \u00a35.7m; Jonas L\u00f6ssl Mainz, \u00a32.3m; Erik Durm Dortmund, und; Juninho Bacuna Groningen, und; Florent Hadergjonaj Ingolstadt, und; Ben Hamer Leicester, free; Isaac Mbenza Montpellier, free. Out: Tom Ince Stoke, \u00a310m; Scott Malone Derby, \u00a32.7m; Michael Hefele Nottingham Forest, und; Sean Scannell Bradford, und; Rob Green Chelsea, free. Leicester City Interest from Manchester United in Harry Maguire was headed off and means that, with the Turkish centre-back Caglar Soyuncu arriving on deadline day, the Foxes\u2019 defence looks healthy. Jonny Evans, signed earlier in the summer, adds experienced competition. Riyad Mahrez departed but Claude Puel has added creativity in James Maddison and Monaco winger Rachid Ghezzal. Nick Ames In: James Maddison Norwich, \u00a324m; Caglar Soyuncu Freiburg, \u00a319m; Ricardo Pereira Porto, \u00a317.5m; Filip Benkovic Dinamo Zagreb \u00a313m; Danny Ward Liverpool \u00a312.5m; Rachid Ghezzal Monaco \u00a312m Out: Riyad Mahrez Manchester City \u00a360m; Ahmed Musa Al-Nasr \u00a314.7m; Connor Wood Braford, und; Josh Gordon Walsall, und; Ben Hamer Huddersfield free; Harvey Barnes West Brom, loan Liverpool A proposed \u00a353m deal for Lyon playmaker Nabil Fekir collapsed before the World Cup and was never revived, but otherwise Liverpool enjoyed a hugely productive window. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s midfield was strengthened with Naby Ke\u00efta and Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri will improve his attacking options and crucially, Klopp finally addressed his goalkeeping problems with the \u00a365m signing of Alisson. AH In: Alisson Roma, \u00a365m; Naby Ke\u00efta RB Leipzig, \u00a352.8m; Fabinho Monaco, \u00a340m; Xherdan Shaqiri Stoke City, \u00a313m.

Manchester City If it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it? Even without the arrival of Riyad Mahrez, Pep Guardiola\u2019s formidable squad was almost certainly strong enough to defend their title. City will trust Mahrez\u2019s ability to thread those visionary passes in tight situations, and the winger could make the difference in Europe. Moreover, finally fit-again \u00a350m full-back Benjamin Mendy will seem like a new signing. Louise Taylor In: Riyad Mahrez Leicester, \u00a360m; Claudio Gomes PSG, free; Philippe Sandler PEC Zwolle, \u00a32.6m; Daniel Arzani Melbourne City, undisclosed. Out: Angus Gunn Southampton, \u00a310m; Pablo Maffeo Stuttgart, \u00a38.1m; Angeli\u00f1o PSV, \u00a35m; Joe Hart Burnley, \u00a33.5m; Bersant Celina Swansea, \u00a33m; Olarenwaju Kayode Shakhtar Donetsk, \u00a32.6m. Manchester United Expect toys to be flung out of the pram and tears before bedtime. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho did not get Harry Maguire \u2013 or any of the centre halves he wanted in order to challenge City and Liverpool for the title. At least he made Fred a red and it will be intriguing to monitor the midfield relationship between the Brazilian and Paul Pogba. It needs to be better than that between Mourinho and Ed Woodward. LT In: Fred Shakhtar Donetsk, \u00a343.7m; Diogo Dalot Porto, \u00a319m; Lee Grant Stoke, \u00a31.5m. Out: Daley Blind Ajax, \u00a314.2m; Sam Johnstone West Brom, \u00a36.5m; Joe Riley Bradford, undisclosed; Timothy Fosu-Mensah Fulham, loan; Cameron Borthwick-Jackson Scunthorpe, loan; Dean Henderson Sheff Utd, loan; Joel Pereira Vit\u00f3ria Set\u00fabal, loan; Axel Tuanzebe Aston Villa, loan. Newcastle United Expect cries of \u201cwhere\u2019s the money gone\u201d from Rafa Ben\u00edtez as Newcastle ended the window showing a healthy profit on player dealings. Swansea centre half Federico Fernandez\u2019s \u00a36m deadline day move was necessary, selling Aleksandar Mitrovic for \u00a322m is amazing business and Newcastle do look stronger than this time last year. Maybe, just maybe, a takeover beckons. LT In: Yoshinori Muto Mainz, \u00a39.5m; Federico Fern\u00e1ndez Swansea, \u00a36m; Martin Dubravka Sparta Prague, \u00a34.5m; Fabian Sch\u00e4r Deportivo, \u00a33.6m; Ki Sung-yueng Swansea, free; Kenedy Chelsea, loan; Sal\u00f3mon Rond\u00f3n West Brom, loan.

Southampton Mark Hughes has pruned his squad yet they finish the window stronger than they started it \u2013 especially after a late loan move for Danny Ings. Mohamed Elyounoussi and Stuart Armstrong should inject some pizzazz into what was becoming a tired squad, and the club have also signed goalkeeper Angus Gunn and centre-back Jannik Vestergaard. Hughes has also kept hold of James Ward-Prowse, Matt Targett, Alex McCarthy and Ryan Bertrand. BF In: Stuart Armstrong Celtic, \u00a37m; Mohamed Elyounoussi Basel, \u00a316m; Angus Gunn Manchester City, \u00a310m, Jannik Vestergaard M\u00f6nchengladbach, \u00a318m; Danny Ings Liverpool, loan. Out: Dusan Tadic Ajax, \u00a315m; Sofiane Boufal Celta Vigo, loan; Jordy Clasie Feyenoord, loan; Guido Carrillo Legan\u00e9s, loan. Tottenham Hotspur Daniel Levy left it late again, but there was no last-gasp splurge from Tottenham this time. They became the first Premier League side not to sign a player in the summer window since its introduction in 2003, with Aston Villa unmoved by interest in Jack Grealish, and also failed to sell Toby Alderweireld, Mousa Demb\u00e9le and Danny Rose. JS In: None Out: Keenan Bennetts Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, \u00a32m; Anton Walkes Portsmouth, undisclosed; Reo Griffiths Lyon, undisclosed Watford Watford\u2019s window started well, with a flurry of useful squad-strengthening activity and the permanent arrival of Gerard Deulofeu, but then turned very quiet, save for a late \u00a31m move for Domingos Quina. The failure to sign a high-profile striker despite their evident need for one is puzzling, and overall the impression is of a club that has stood still. Simon Burnton In: Gerard Deulofeu Barcelona, \u00a311.5m; Ben Foster West Brom, \u00a34m; Adam Masina Bologna, \u00a33.5m; Marc Navarro Espanyol, \u00a33m; Domingos Quina West Ham, \u00a31m; Ken Sema Ostersund, \u00a31m; Ben Wilmot Stevenage, und.

West Ham United West Ham completed most of their business early, with Manuel Pellegrini in a hurry to make extensive improvements to his new side. They broke their transfer record to sign Felipe Anderson from Lazio, signed Ryan Fredericks and Jack Wilshere on frees, and finished a busy window by signing Lucas P\u00e9rez from Arsenal and Carlos S\u00e1nchez from Fiorentina. JS In: Felipe Anderson Lazio, \u00a333.5m; Issa Diop Toulouse, \u00a322.5m; Andriy Yarmolenko Dortmund, \u00a317.5m; Lukasz Fabianski Swansea, \u00a37m; Lucas P\u00e9rez Arsenal, \u00a34m; Fabian Balbuena Corinthians, \u00a33.5m; Carlos S\u00e1nchez Fiorentina, undisclosed; Xande Silva Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, undisclosed; Ryan Fredericks Fulham, free; Jack Wilshere Arsenal, free.

Wolverhampton Wanderers Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Leander Dendoncker and Adama Traor\u00e9 are the stand-out names from a frantic summer that also saw key players from their promotion season nailed down to permanent deals. Wolves have moved decisively although they arguably still lack a prolific forward \u2013 Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez will look to change that \u2013 and it was a big call to let set-piece specialist Barry Douglas join Leeds for what looks a cut-price fee.
