In the meantime, the latest Washington Post/ABC tracking poll shows the national race is neck and neck: although the top line is Obama with 49% and Romney on 48%, the actually numbers before rounding are Obama 48.56% and Romney 48.49%. The Associated Press is reporting that the Romney campaign has confirmed a visit by Mitt Romney to Pennsylvania on Sunday: Campaign officials on Thursday confirmed that Romney plans to hold a rally in the state two days before the election. The appearance would come shortly after his campaign began airing ads in the state. Romney officials say the push into Pennsylvania is aimed at expanding the map as polls show a closer race in a state that has backed Democrats in recent presidential elections. Democrats dismiss those claims. They say the push is evidence that Romney won't win other battleground states, like Ohio, and that he needs to look elsewhere for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. So: stroke of genius or desperate gamble? Taegen Goddard reminds us: It's worth noting that Senator John McCain made a similar late play for Pennsylvania in 2008 but ended up losing the state by 10 points. The RCP polling average in PA has Obama ahead in every poll in the state for the last eight months and gives the Democratic candidate a 4.6% lead on its latest poll of polls average. I'm sure the Romney people think this is terribly clever. But chances are they will be rueing that they didn't go to Iowa or Nevada. With all the Bloomberg excitement, we missed the Twitter war between Donald Trump and Chrysler, specifically Chrysler Group vice president for product design, Ralph Gilles: It's like Sandy woke America up. Update: A reader has just reminded me: Mike Bloomberg endorsed George W Bush's re-election as president in 2004, and spoke at the RNC in New York City that same year. The parallel between Bloomberg's 2012 and 2004 endorsement is that both appear to owe something to a president's reaction to a tragic event involving New York City. Here's what Bloomberg told the RNC in 2004: No place epitomizes the American experience and the American spirit more than New York City. Ironically, it is exactly because we are a city that embraces freedom, that welcomes everyone and encourages their dreams, that New York remains on the front lines in the war on terror. I want to thank President Bush for supporting New York City and changing the homeland security funding formula and for leading the global war on terrorism. The president deserves our support. We are here to support him. And I am here to support him. We all must recognize that homeland security funds should be allocated by threat and no other reason. And I will repeat this message to my fellow Republicans, Democrats and independents as many times as it takes so we can keep New York safe and secure. New Yorkers will go forward doing our duty for our city, our nation and our families and we know that you will, too. Because in our greatest hour of need, you, all our fellow Americans, from every corner of this land, were there for us. And we owe you more than we can say. Funny, climate change doesn't seem to be such a big deal. The Obama campaign have sent round words from the president, with Barack Obama saying he is honored to have Mike Bloomberg's support: I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days. While we may not agree on every issue, Mayor Bloomberg and I agree on the most important issues of our time \u2013 that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people, that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy, and that climate change is a threat to our children's future, and we owe it to them to do something about it. Just as importantly, we agree that whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or independents, there is only one way to solve these challenges and move forward as a nation \u2013 together. I look forward to thanking him in person \u2013 but for now, he has my continued commitment that this country will stand by New York in its time of need. And New Yorkers have my word that we will recover, we will rebuild, and we will come back stronger. As my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg notes: Obama has slyly knocked climate change down a couple of notches from Bloomberg's endorsement, so that it's third behind \"a strong economy\" and \"immigration reform\" in Obama's version. Smooth. The Guardian's US environmental editor, Suzanne Goldenberg, puts the Mike Bloomberg endorsement of Obama into context: Mitt Romney for the first time has come under attack for his failure to admit the danger of climate change \u2013 reflecting a change in the political agenda in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy's devastation. New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg cited climate change as a reason for snubbing Romney and endorsing Barack Obama. Romney used Obama's promises on global warming as a laugh line in his convention speech \u2013 which went over well with Republicans who deny climate change is occurring or oppose economic interventions to address the problem. Romney was also heckled by a climate protester at a rally in Virginia \u2013 though he was quickly drowned out by the crowd shouting: USA, USA Bloomberg said Sandy made it painfully clear elected officials need to act on climate change. \u201cThe devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the Northeast \u2014 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2014 brought the stakes of next Tuesday\u2019s presidential election into sharp relief,\u201d Bloomberg wrote in an op-ed article for Bloomberg View. \u201cOur climate is changing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be \u2014 given the devastation it is wreaking \u2014 should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\u201d Businessweek, which is owned by Bloomberg, made the same point even more sharply with a cover reading: \u201cIt's Global Warming, Stupid.\u201d The Obama campaign have announced Barack Obama's final day of election appearances will be in Madison, Wisconsin, Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa. So there we have it, Obama's three must wins: Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa. Indeed if Obama wins those three, then Mitt Romney almost certainly cannot win the electoral college without a big upset elsewhere. Calling it \"a surprise announcement,\" local paper the New York Times seems chagrined at Mike Bloomberg's decision to endorse Obama: Mr Bloomberg\u2019s endorsement was largely unexpected. For months, the Obama and Romney campaigns have sought the mayor\u2019s endorsement, in large part because they believe he could influence independent voters around the country. Mr Bloomberg has steadfastly withheld his support, largely because he had grown frustrated with the tone and substance of the presidential campaign \u2013 recently deriding as \u201cgibberish\u201d the answers that Mr Obama and Mr Romney gave during a debate to a question about an assault weapons ban. He has expressed disappointment with Mr Obama\u2019s performance over the past few years, and concern about what he has described as Mr Romney\u2019s shifts in views over time. After appearing to be withholding his endorsement from either candidate, Mike Bloomberg dropped an endorsement-bomb today with his public support for Barack Obama as president. Although Bloomberg's article explaining his reasoning was two-handed \u2013 he labelled Obama a disappointment \u2013 it seems clear that Hurricane Sandy may have been behind the NYC mayor's decision, only three days since Sandy battered his beloved city. Although he also mentions women's rights and gun control among the issues that helped him decide, Bloomberg states bluntly: The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the Northeast \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election into sharp relief. \"Our climate is changing,\" he continues, arguing that the risk of climate change \"should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\" Bloomberg makes clear his thinking by contrasting Obama and Romney's records: But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House \u2013 and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. Romney, in contrast, has \"reversed course\" on his previous support for policies to tackle climate change. The irony here is that climate change has barely been mentioned at all during the election campaign, and was never mentioned by name during the presidential debates. In the Republican primaries, candidates queued up to pour scorn on the very notion of man-made climate change. And now Bloomberg has made their party \u2013 which he was once a member of \u2013 pay the ultimate political price. Bloomberg then fires a lethal shot at Romney: I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts. Interestingly, a close reading of Bloomberg essay makes it seem that he was planning to endorse Obama before Sandy. If that's true then presumably he was planning to punish the Republican party's war on climate change even before Sandy's unwanted attention. So that's the Economist and Mike Bloomberg who have endorsed Barack Obama today over the job-creating businessman former head of Bain Capital. That's got to hurt. Still, Romney's got Donald Trump. Er.... take your pick: So there we go: Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York City, has endorsed Barack Obama for president. Bloomberg made the endorsement in a piece for Bloomberg Views, and posted on his personal website: When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties\u2019 nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America. One believes a woman\u2019s right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of Supreme Court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision. One recognizes marriage equality as consistent with America\u2019s march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history. One sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics. Of course, neither candidate has specified what hard decisions he will make to get our economy back on track while also balancing the budget. But in the end, what matters most isn't the shape of any particular proposal; it\u2019s the work that must be done to bring members of Congress together to achieve bipartisan solutions. Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress \u2013 and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him. Secretary of the Treasury Bloomberg? The latest episode of \"Romneyballs\" \u2013 charting the claims made by Mitt Romney on the campaign trail that turn out to be economical with the actualit\u00e9 \u2013 is upon us. Yesterday Mitt Romney gave a speech in Jacksonville, Florida, that included these remarks: it's a very helpful thing if a nation has the most productivity in the world and we do. By the way, I used to hear the world productivity and I wondered what that meant. What they do is they look at everything that a county makes, everything they manufacture, all the services they sell, they add it all up and divide it by the number of people in the workforce and that's output per person. And we are the most productive major nation in the world. OK, so first Romney claims that the US \"has the most productivity in the world,\" a claim that doesn't actually make any sense given the following remarks, since he then helpfully defines productivity. Sadly on the measure he cites \u2013 output per person \u2013 the US only comes fourth in the world, according to the OECD. But wait! Having made one claim, Romney then switches his argument to \"the most productive major nation in the world\" \u2013 which is helpful, since the four that outrank the US in productivity are Norway, Luxembourg and Ireland. Phew. The Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog reports on an official Romney campaign ad \"that links President Barack Obama with Venezuelan strongman Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Fidel Castro's niece and communist revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara\" being aired on Spanish language TV in Florida. Here's the Herald's translation of the ad, which is a cheap shot of guilt by association: NARRATOR: Who supports Barack Obama? CHAVEZ: \"If I were American, I'd vote for Obama.\" NARRATOR: Ra\u00fal Castro's daughter, Mariela Castro, would vote for Obama. CASTRO: \"I would vote for President Obama.\" NARRATOR: And to top it off, Obama's Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage month with a photo of Che Guevara. CHAVEZ: \"If Obama were from Barlovento [Venezuelan town], he'd vote for Ch\u00e1vez.\" ROMNEY: I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message. Funnily enough, as the Herald points out, just yesterday \"Mitt Romney was onstage in Miami talking about the need to unite the country and to stop all the attacks\". The NYT's resident numbers wonk Nate Silver dons white coat, turns on the super-computer and spits out some analysis: Mr Obama is not a sure thing, by any means. It is a close race. His chances of holding onto his Electoral College lead and converting it into another term are equivalent to the chances of an NFL team winning when it leads by a field goal with three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. There are plenty of things that could go wrong, and sometimes they will. But it turns out that an NFL team that leads by a field goal with three minutes left to go winds up winning the game 79% of the time. Those were Mr Obama\u2019s chances in the FiveThirtyEight forecast as of Wednesday: 79%. Not coincidentally, these are also about Mr Obama\u2019s chances of winning Ohio, according to the forecast. Socialist rag the Economist has come out with an endorsement of Barack Obama for president \u2013 and in doing so unleashed a harsh critique of Mitt Romney's policies and of the Republican party in general: Mr Romney\u2019s more sensible supporters explain his fiscal policies away as necessary rubbish, concocted to persuade the fanatics who vote in the Republican primaries: the great flipflopper, they maintain, does not mean a word of it. Of course, he knows in current circumstances no sane person would really push defence spending, projected to fall below 3% of GDP, to 4%; of course President Romney would strike a deal that raises overall tax revenues, even if he cuts tax rates. However, even if you accept that Romneynomics may be more numerate in practice than it is in theory, it is far harder to imagine that he will reverse course entirely. When politicians get elected they tend to do quite a lot of the things they promised during their campaigns. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s famously pliable new president, was supposed to be too pragmatic to introduce a 75% top tax rate, yet he is steaming ahead with his plan. We weren\u2019t fooled by the French left; we see no reason why the American right will be more flexible. Mr Romney, like Mr Hollande, will have his party at his back \u2014 and a long record of pandering to them. Well that's the Balliol College SCR vote gone for Romney. Finally, the Economist concludes: Many of The Economist\u2019s readers, especially those who run businesses in America, may well conclude that nothing could be worse than another four years of Mr Obama. We beg to differ. For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don\u2019t believe most of what he says. So many swing state polls today \u2013 here are the highlights outsourced to the excellent Taegen Goddard's Political Wire: Colorado: Romney 50%, Obama 47% (Rasmussen) Colorado: Obama 49%, Romney 48% (CallFire) Iowa: Obama 50%, Romney 44% (NBC/WSJ/Marist) Iowa: Obama 50%, Romney 47% (CallFire) Michigan: Obama 53%, Romney 45% (Public Policy Polling) Nevada: Obama 50%, Romney 46% (SurveyUSA) New Hampshire: Obama 49%, Romney 47% (NBC/WSJ/Marist) North Carolina: Romney 46%, Obama 45% (High Point University) Virginia: Obama 49%, Romney 46% (Public Policy Polling) Wisconsin: Obama 49%, Romney 46% (NBC/WSJ/Marist) Wisconsin: Obama 49%, Romney 49% (Rasmussen) Since opinion polling angel-pinhead-dancing capacity appears to be a crucial question these days, here's a generous examination of the issue including some Republican perspective, by the National Journal's Reid Wilson: What concerns Republicans most is the fact that media polls seem to track more closely with Democratic internals than with the GOP's numbers. Internal surveys conducted for candidates like George Allen in Virginia, Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Josh Mandel in Ohio draw much rosier conclusions than polls conducted for their Democratic counterparts Tim Kaine, Joe Donnelly and Sherrod Brown. And media surveys, at least in Virginia and Ohio, show Kaine and Brown winning (restrictive Indiana laws make polling prohibitively expensive there). Republicans say their party is a victim of media bias \u2013 but not in the standard Lamestream Media sort of way. Pollsters on both sides try to persuade public surveyors that their voter turnout models are more accurate reflections of what's going to happen on Election Day. This year, GOP pollsters and strategists believe those nonpartisan pollsters are adopting Democratic turnout models en masse. Reid's conclusion: Republicans believe Democrats are counting far too much on low-propensity voters and a booming minority turnout that isn't going to materialize on Election Day. Democrats believe Republicans are hopelessly reliant on an electorate that looks far more like their party than the nation as a whole. The day after Election Day, somebody's pollsters are going to be proven seriously wrong. Obama for America is back on the offensive with another smack at Mitt Romney's \"let Detroit go bankrupt\" comment. There's no telling how much damage a dumb remark can do \u2013 and this is an example of something that was never an issue in the GOP primary \u2013 Romney won Michigan \u2013 but blows up big time in the general election. For fans of media-politics inside baseball: Many Republicans and Politico have been engaged in bizarre guerrilla warfare aimed at the New York Times' polling guru Nate Silver, whose election model was the only thing keeping the Democratic party from headless panic while the Romney surge was at its height last month. The motivations of the those involved at throwing mud at Silver is suspect \u2013 the Republicans because it punctures their narrative of inevitable Mittmentum and Politico because of jealousy. Now MSNBC breakfast host and former GOP congressman Joe Scarborough has taken his one-sided feud with Silver even further with snide remarks on his show and via Twitter. Silver responded this morning: Scarborough responds with a non-sequiter of moral high ground-claiming: Way to miss the point, Joe. Silver comes back: The Romney campaign has just added details of its candidate's whistle-stops on Saturday: a rally at Portsmouth International Airport in New Hampshire, a quick hop and a rally at Dubuque Regional Airport in Iowa, and then a further rally at Colorado Springs Municipal Airport, ending with an evening event at the Comfort Dental Amphitheatre in Englewood, Colorado. Yes, the Comfort Dental Amphitheatre: The amphitheatre was opened in 1998 under the name of Fiddler\u2019s Green amphitheatre.... The theatre was then renamed Coors Amphitheatre and it was operating under an exclusive license with House of Blues. It was then sold to its new operator Live Nation. Under the new contract the name of the amphitheatre was again changed to Fiddler\u2019s Green Amphitheatre and then to Comfort Dental Amphitheatre. Making his first campaign appearance for four days, Barack Obama lands in front on a modest crowd at a chilly airport in Green Bay, where he's appearing with Tammy Baldwin, likely to be Wisconsin's next US senator if the polls are anything to go by. Obama starts by talking about the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and his visit to New Jersey When disaster strikes, we see America at its very best. All the petty differences that divide us seem to melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans, just Americans.... a spirit that says, we're all in this together. Obama soon moves on to more familiar campaign themes, of the progress made over the last four years, including the death of Osama bin Laden. It's Obama's first visit to Wisconsin for nearly a month: the fact that he's making a flying visit suggests some nervousness about the state's 10 electoral college votes. Wisconsin has been the crucible of American politics for the past two years and how it votes next Tuesday will be significant as a result. Bloomberg BusinessWeek's Joshua Green has an in-depth profile of Mitt Romney's business career and its influence \u2013 and ponders why Romney has discarded his time at Bain Capital as a political liability: Yet instead of putting that career at the center of his campaign, Romney has taken pains to avoid it. After an early attempt to portray himself as a \u201cjob creator\u201d who put 100,000 people to work, he mostly dropped the subject of his time at Bain Capital. Ceding that story allowed his opponents to frame the race around the most unflattering details of his career \u2014 layoffs, plant closings \u2014 stripped of their broader context, and to portray Romney as a vulture capitalist. If he loses, that will be why. Keeping tabs on the election ad spending shows that 2012 is well above that of 2008. Media business analysts SNL Kagan has research out today: According to SNL Kagan\u2019s most recent projections, this year\u2019s TV station political advertising revenue is expected to increase to $2.6bn, a 68% increase over the 2008 total of $1.6bn. The swing states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, predictably have emerged as the political battleground for 2012 presidential election spending. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign has outspent President Barack Obama in TV and radio advertising in these states, with well over half a billion dollars already spent with local broadcasters. Mitt Romney is speaking in another factory in Roanoke, Virginia, and he appears to be giving his standard stump speech, parts of which haven't changed for over a year. It's all there, the same old stand-bys: the Boy Scouts, the single moms struggling to get by, all delivered with the passion and oratory of an sales manager at Sears. The Big Dog is really getting into the swing of things with five \u2013 yes, five \u2013 appearances by Bill Clinton in Florida tomorrow, followed by another three in Virginia on Saturday. Here's the official announcement: Obama for America announced today that President Bill Clinton will campaign in Florida on Friday, November 2 and Virginia on Saturday, November 3. In Florida, President Bill Clinton will campaign in Fort Myers, Palm Beach, Palm Bay, St Petersburg and Tallahassee. On Saturday, President Bill Clinton will campaign in Chesapeake and Roanoke and then join President Obama and Dave Matthews for an evening grassroots event in Bristow, Virginia. Dave Matthews? Oh well. Remember the presidential election? Well it's back on with a vengeance today as the dueling campaigns concentrate their efforts on the crucial swing states such as Virginia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Ohio and Iowa with just five full days of campaigning left. Mitt Romney will camp out in Virginia with three campaign rallies in the more southern parts of the state including Richmond and Roanoke, while Barack Obama takes Air Force One to Wisconsin for a rally in Green Bay, followed by stops in Las Vegas and Denver this evening. Paul Ryan appears to be shadowing the president in reverse, with appearances today in Colorado and Nevada, while Joe Biden brings his own brand of campaigning to the people of Iowa, with two stops there today before traveling to Wisconsin. As the campaign trail heats up again we'll be covering all the events as they happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
