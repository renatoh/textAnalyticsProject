Several beaches along Queensland's Gold Coast were closed for a second day after hammerhead, grey nurse and whaler sharks were spotted feeding close to shore, said Sue Neil, a spokeswoman for Surf Lifesaving Queensland. Ms Neil said some surfers had come within metres of the sharks. \"When they [sharks] feed on the bait fish they do close their eyes and there is a danger of collision,\" she said. \"If they are chomping, they could very easily chomp on humans.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
