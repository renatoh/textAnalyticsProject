Commander Mark Sheehan, commander of the Lynx helicopter force, said: \"The situation is looking undeniably bleak and the search for survivors has now been called off.\" The helicopter crashed into the sea 17 miles east of Lizard Point at around 7pm on Wednesday. Earlier, the wreckage of the helicopter was found on the seabed after an oil slick and debris was spotted by the Falmouth all-weather lifeboat. The crew said they had recovered pieces of wreckage from the water, and an RNLI spokeswoman said they had detected \"a strong smell of aviation fuel\". The Lynx helicopter had been scrambled on a search and rescue mission off the Cornish coast at 5.45pm yesterday after two Navy ratings on board the frigate HMS Montrose heard cries for help coming from the water. It was assumed that someone had fallen overboard from the Montrose or the nearby HMS St Albans, although all on board were later accounted for. French warships in the area also confirmed they had nobody missing. Contact with the helicopter was lost just after 7pm as it carried out a sweep 19 miles off Lizard Point. Commander John Parris, a Royal Navy spokesman, said no SOS call had been made, but the aircraft - from the Royal Naval air station in Yeovilton, Somerset - had disappeared from radar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
