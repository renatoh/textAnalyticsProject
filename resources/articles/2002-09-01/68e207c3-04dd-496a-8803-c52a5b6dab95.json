Yet when Sir Bobby Robson's team play in Ukraine they are unlikely to feel they have arrived. Excellence is about maintaining a position as well as attaining it and Gary Speed did not hide. \"We have to go there and make the most of it,\" he said, \"because the way we are playing we're not going to make the Champions League again. We have to concentrate on getting our Premiership form back, otherwise it's going to be a very poor season.\" Talk of a crisis is ridiculous after five matches but Newcastle did not expect to be 19th. After losing at home to Leeds last Wednesday this was their second straight defeat to a side they would want at least to match. Newcastle performed without solidity or spark. They have conceded seven goals in three matches, albeit to Liverpool, Leeds and Chelsea, and lack a defender of top international quality. Shay Given, often a saviour in goal, was largely at fault for giving away No3 that killed things off. Not that Newcastle had threatened to haul themselves back after going 2-0 down in half an hour. That was partly a tribute to William Gallas and Marcel Desailly at centre-back but also a reflection of the visitors' limited attacking guile. Alan Shearer requires crosses but had only one of note. He offered little while Craig Bellamy was not at his sharpest after injury. Kieron Dyer made several good off-the-ball runs from midfield but never produced the final touch and it was hard to know whether Laurent Robert got a touch at all. A couple of glares from Shearer did not require words. They excite when taking the game to opponents at speed but do not have the resolve to grind out points when their attack is not functioning. Their wide midfielders cannot be relied upon defensively and the back four lacked presence. \"On the evidence so far they're top four,\" Robson said of Chelsea. \"They're eight points ahead of us now. That's not in March, it's in September. We've got some recovering to do.\" To combat Newcastle's position Robson will hope his central defence grows as secure as Chelsea's was on Saturday. He compared Desailly and Gallas with Arsenal's old Tony Adams/ Martin Keown axis. \"There's not much better in the whole Premiership,\" he said. \"They gave us nothing.\" Claudio Ranieri called his centre-halves \"extra-terrestrial\", presumably meaning they were out of this world. Gallas will surely play for France soon and John Terry cannot count on a place when he returns. Despite three goals Chelsea's display was efficient rather than inspired. But, given the frequency with which they have fluctuated wildly from one half to the next under Ranieri, there was something to be admired in that steadiness. Unbeaten this season, Ranieri appears to be on the road to consistency. Chelsea still need to show they can turn draws into wins but, having let leads slip at home to Manchester United and Arsenal, they took no chance on a repeat. Once they had a two-goal cushion Ranieri's players retreated, pressed the ball relentlessly from the strikers backwards and looked to counter-attack. Ranieri is pragmatic rather than incessantly adventurous and his philosophy appears to be taking root. He expects his players to fight for every ball, give opponents no room and avoid dithering on the break. That produced two goals, with Boudewijn Zenden quick to cross for Eidur Gudjohnsen's first and Newcastle pressed into an error for the Icelander's second. Given should have cleared a backpass but fed Aaron Hughes, who lost possession to allow Gianfranco Zola to cross. Between times Zola's free-kick went in off Speed. Few comings or goings this summer may have helped Ranieri. \"This year we look more like a squad,\" said Mario Stanic. \"Everyone's fighting and when you play this way the results come. In this way it will be difficult for Manchester [United], for Arsenal, for everyone to beat us. We are hungry this year because we have to win something.\" A Uefa Cup tie at home to Norway's Viking on Thursday gives Chelsea a chance to show they can retain their hunger against minnows. If Newcastle want to be back in the Champions League they will have to improve fast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
