Lauren Bacall, Edna O'Brien and admiring academics, diplomats and friends sang his praises. In the library from where Phileas Fogg set off round the world in 80 days, Schlesinger's memory rounded it in 90 years. Schlesinger was the best sort of historian, an arguing one. It was impossible to meet him, even in old age, without some exquisite dispute. He championed the New Deal and the Kennedy era. He espoused the British liberal tradition as the founding glue of the American adventure. Multiculturalists might not like it, he wrote in The Disuniting of America, but \"to deny the essentially European origins of American culture is to falsify history\". Above all, he believed in history as the \"great explainer\" of human affairs. The finest eulogy came from William vanden Heuvel, quoting from Schlesinger himself in a talk last December that was aimed straight between the eyes of the Bush administration. \"History is a moral necessity for a nation which is the world's dominant military power,\" said Schlesinger. \"It is the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience.\" History forever reminded us \"of the limits of our passing perspectives ... of our profound and chastening frailty as human beings\". How could George Bush have made such a mess of post-9/11? Britain has just said goodbye to probably its least historical prime minister ever. Tony Blair's occasional references to the past were barely worthy of 1066 and All That. He equated Saddam with Hitler, 9/11 with the second world war, and an urban bomb blast with \"war\". He thought Iraq could be \"rebuilt\" as Germany had been in 1945. He thought the tribes of southern Afghanistan could be conquered by British arms. By siding with Israel he still thinks he can \"bring peace to the Middle East\". He has no concept of armed conflict, yet he can describe bomb plots as \"threatening our very way of life\". He cannot think much of that way of life it he believes it to be so vulnerable. But then no one taught him history. The irony is that Blair's government took its cue from that of Margaret Thatcher, driven by an acute historical perception of Britain's postwar failure. Her working motto, applied to the 1970s, was Kipling's \"We have had no end of a lesson: it will do us no end of good.\" Blair opposed all she did in power and then, when in power, mimicked it, whether on privatisation, hospitals, schools, welfare reform, even Europe. Yet by never studying what she and her predecessors had confronted, he was unable to avoid her mistakes, leading to frequent professions of failure. Surgeons, judges, generals, chief executives, all are expected to learn the tools of their trade. The product of any prime minister's trade is history - a fact most of them learn only when pondering their \"legacy\". They should be compelled on appointment to go on a fortnight's crash course. They should learn the rudiments of constitutional law, economic history and foreign policy, and case histories of the follies of their immediate forebears. (What a glorious syllabus to write.) Previous prime ministers should be invited to lecture on the theme, \"Whatever you do, for God's sake don't ...\" Leaders such as Gordon Brown who profess an eagerness to change everything they have spent 10 years creating should produce a dissertation on what apparently went wrong. \"Change for change's sake\" is merely exhausting and expensive, as the NHS knows to its cost. A refusal to study the lessons of the recent past is to succumb to Gibbon's definition of history as nothing but \"the register of the crime, follies and misfortunes of mankind\". This week the Brownite house journal, Prospect, makes a valiant attempt to present its hero as an intellectual, a term apparently equated with reading books and knowing how to pronounce Gramsci. While reading may be a necessary condition for intellectual status, it is not sufficient. Any fool can read and (like a columnist) dapple his prose with quotes. Brown's reading seems confined to American conservatives such as James Wilson, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Francis Fukuyama, and the groupies of dehumanised globalisation seminars. He does not enjoy fiction or those with whom he might disagree. Nor has he ever matched his apparent belief in \"civil society\" (whatever that means) with his controlling and authoritarian decisions in government. Brown shows no trace of comprehending such shrewd analysts of American democracy as De Tocqueville or Hayek, champions of Brown's pet hate, civic autonomy. Reading is pointless without understanding. The mind must follow a narrative thread, shining a lamp on the past so as better to illumine the future. A true intellectual knows that history is not Voltaire's \"tableau of crimes\" or Carlyle's \"innumerable biographies\" or Henry Ford's \"bunk\". It is an educated understanding of how human beings have behaved as citizens, communities and nations. Schlesinger's favourite quote was from Churchill: \"the longer you look back, the further you can look forward\". He was fascinated by melting pot America, by the American genius for creating unum e pluribus, one nation from many peoples. The secret, he was convinced, lay in America's liberal/democratic inheritance from Europe. But history taught him that America's constitutional equilibrium had to be understood if it was to be upheld. Balance lay in ensuring that democracy breathed free at every level of society, the direct opposite of Brown's \"target-driven state\". I do not see how anyone can be a proper citizen, let alone prime minister, with no knowledge of British history in the round. Yet history is now devalued to optional in schools as well as in politics. The resulting collapse of civic discipline, the new \"British disease\", imposes ever rising costs in law and order, social supervision and regulation. A disempowered public knows only how to take instructions from above. It hears its rulers incanting \"change\", but the word is meaningless when there is no knowledge of change from what and to what, when there is no reference point in history. Schlesinger was appalled after 9/11 to see his country deploy extreme violence and thus \"turn a global wave of sympathy for America into a global wave of hatred\". I do not regard Bush or Blair (or Brown) as inherently immoral or aggressive or imperialist, any more than I think they intended the outcome of their belligerence. I do believe that, without an ounce of history between them, they just did not know what they were doing. \u00b7 Retraction: Earlier this month I wrote that Scottish nationalism must be an empty, mercenary thing for refusing to spend a penny rescuing Scotland's finest at-risk monument, Robert Adam's Dumfries House, complete with Chippendale furnishings. The house seemed lost, its contents due to be sold last week. My comments shamed some Scots, but upset many. On Monday Edinburgh reversed its decision with a \u00a35m grant. The house is to be kept intact under a trust and open to the public. I joyfully revise my view. Nationalism is a mature, civilised movement, proud of Scotland's history and protective of its culture. Long may it prosper. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
