Tim Leunig told a meeting that he regretted Pickles's continued role in government, describing him as \"the biggest obstacle\" to building affordable housing. He went on to warn that under a new coalition pensions policy the government would \"steal\" money from some people to balance the books, while describing young people seeking to buy a home under the coalition as \"buggered\". Leunig went further, to claim that the prime minister's localism agenda appeared \"to be failing catastrophically\". He added: \"I see no prospect for change at the moment, no prospect for housing becoming affordable, no good prospects for anyone who is younger than me\". The outburst at the Liberal Democrat conference two weeks ago \u2013 just eight days before he started in his new civil service role \u2013 will be a considerable embarrassment for the education secretary and the new Lib Dem education minister David Laws, who is believed to have championed Leunig. Talking to the Observer, the economist admitted that his comments had been \"tactless\" and \"inflammatory\". It is not, however, the first time Leunig's public statements have put him at the centre of a political row. He has previously been described as \"barmy\" by David Cameron for his role in co-authoring a 2008 report in which ministers were urged to give up on regenerating the north of England. The announcement of his appointment even moved deputy prime minister Nick Clegg to reassure critics that Leunig would have no role in economic regeneration. The former Oxford and LSE academic's latest controversial outburst was at a meeting held by the rightwing thinktank, Policy Exchange. He told the meeting, attended by communities minister Don Foster, that in 1996 he had been able to buy a home but it was now often impossible for young people. He said: \"There's a technical term for it \u2013 buggered.\" Leunig said that the government's policy of \"localism without incentives\", where there was no financial impulse for communities to support the building of more homes, \"appears to be failing catastrophically\". And he voiced his support for a scheme that he has backed since 2007, whereby local authorities buy agricultural land, grant planning permission and sell the land on to developers. Under the scheme, the local authority could pocket the difference in price. Leunig told the meeting: \"The chancellor has twice put community land auctions in budgets and Mr Pickles has said 'noted' \u2013 and then ignored it.\" In response to the prime minister's decision to keep Pickles in his job during the recent reshuffle, Leunig added: \"I personally regret that, because he is the biggest obstacle we have to moving towards an affordable housing market. \"However, I'm not the prime minister \u2013 and I don't suppose that I will ever be prime minister.\" In a further intervention, he said that the government's policy of \"auto-enrolling\" workers into an employer's pension scheme would not work for someone who was likely to be in the private rented sector after retirement. Leunig said that such a person would probably be in receipt of housing benefits which they would lose if they had such a pension. He said: \"The government will steal the money back from you, in lower housing benefit, when your retire.\" Jack Dromey, the shadow housing minister, claimed that while Leunig had revealed the flaws in government policy it was the chancellor to blame. He said: \"Big, Eric may be but the biggest obstacle is George Osborne who has failed economically and whose housing policy has created the toxic combination of a catastrophic housing crisis and the deepest economic recession since the war\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
