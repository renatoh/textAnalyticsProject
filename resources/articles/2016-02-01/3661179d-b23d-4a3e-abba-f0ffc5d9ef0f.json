Predictable because despite late surges for Spotlight and The Big Short, The Revenant will almost certain sweep the board in the major categories (with Mad Max: Fury Road doing the same for the technical awards). An unknown quantity as not within recent memory has the ceremony been under such fire. The #OscarsSoWhite controversy reignited following nominations which didn\u2019t include a single actor of colour for the second year running. And for the six weeks of campaigning, it\u2019s the diversity issue which has dominated the debate. We\u2019ll be covering the red carpet, the ceremony and the aftermath \u2013 so here\u2019s a few pointers as to what to look out for, some final predictions and a timetable. What you need to know \u2022 This is likely to be the final Oscars in which white people loom so conspicuously among the nominees. That\u2019s in large part on account of the backlash (in part from advertisers disgruntled by a proposed audience boycott). Protests are planned both round the red carpet, round the country \u2013 and, perhaps, inside the auditorium. Whether the measures proposed by Academy boss Cheryl Boone Isaac to up the voters\u2019 ethnic and gender mix are deemed legitimate remains to be seen. \u2022 We\u2019re anticipating a pretty-much non-stop stream of diversity jokes from host Chris Rock; as well as a five-minute speech on the topic from Quincy Jones. \u2022 Here we reveal who is really to blame for the diversity debate (spoiler: us!) and what we ought to do about it in a 10-point plan by the woman who started the hashtag trending. \u2022 Bone up on some previous Oscars controversies, imagine which black actors might have won in the past and cackle at some legendary Oscars snubs. \u2022 Leonardo DiCaprio is the surest thing ever for best actor; Brie Larson looking likely for best actress \u2013 unless Charlotte Rampling pulls off the biggest upset in Academy history. \u2022 Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu looks certain to buck the #OscarsSoWhite trend and bag the best picture and director gongs for a second year running (this time for The Revenant; last time for Birdman). Meanwhile his Mexican cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, may make it a hat-trick (he also won in 2014 for Gravity). \u2022 She knows; she\u2019s been there \u2013 the Secret Actress on how Meryl Streep helped her dry her armpits on the big night. \u2022 Find out about this year\u2019s British short film nominees. \u2022 Who cares about the prizes \u2013 which movie made most money? \u2022 Watch Guardian staff cheerlead for their favourites in our Oscar hustings. \u2022 And find out how it feels to use the luxury loo roll included in the official Oscars goodie bag. Final predictions Here\u2019s Peter Bradshaw\u2019s tips; here\u2019s Mark Kermode, Guy Lodge, Catherine Shoard and Carmen Gray\u2019s; here\u2019s Nigel M Smith\u2019s anaylsis of which movies came out of the campaign the strongest and here\u2019s a full list of nominations. And here is our final guess in the key categories: Best picture: The Revenant Best director: Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, The Revenant Best actor: Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant Best actress: Brie Larson, Room Best supporting actor: Sylvester Stallone, Creed Best supporting actress: Kate Winslet, Steve Jobs Best original screenplay: Straight Outta Compton Best adapted screenplay: The Big Short Best documentary: Amy Best original song: Writing\u2019s On the Wall, Spectre Best animated feature: Inside Out Best foreign language film: Son of Saul Timetable Join us from 2:30pm PT, 5:30pm ET, 10.30pm GMT and 9.30am (Monday) AEDT for live coverage from the red carpet, including a minute-by-minute blog, rolling news, galleries, analysis and comment, taking in the ceremony \u2013 which starts at 5:30pm PT, 8:30pm ET and 1:30am GMT \u2013 and the aftermath.
