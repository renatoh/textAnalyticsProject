The Foxes have made Levein their No1 candidate to succeed Micky Adams, who walked out on the East Midlands club this month, but an initial attempt to approach him was rejected by the Edinburgh-based club. However, Vladimir Romanov, the Scottish Premier league side's new owner, changed his mind after a meeting with Levein yesterday. The 40-year-old, who has revived Hearts fortunes since succeeding Jim Jefferies four years ago and steered them into the Uefa Cup for the past three seasons, made it clear he wanted to leave because of a series of question marks over the club's future. He is concerned by the impending takeover of the Lithuanian millionaire, which is due to be completed in December, and his plans to install the former CIS Olympic and European Championship coach Anatoly Byshovets as \"director of football\". Levein, who previously managed Cowdenbeath, also fears a backlash from supporters over the proposed sale of Tynecastle and a move to Murrayfield, the home of Scottish rugby union. Moreover, he feels he has taken Hearts as far as he can because the club lacks the resources needed to end the duopoly of Celtic and Rangers in the Scottish game. By contrast, returning the Foxes to the Premiership and keeping them there presents a new but achievable challenge. Levein was understood to have travelled to Leicester last night to open negotiations with Foxes officials today. He is expected to be offered a 2-year contract worth \u00a3700,000. Although still reeling from the effects of their spell in administration and short of finances, the Foxes are prepared to pay the \u00a3250,000 compensation Hearts want for the loss of Levein. He is regarded as one of the most promising young managers in British football and is seen by Leicester as having the ability to take them back to the Premiership. And he will arrive with the seal of approval from Martin O'Neill, their former manager. O'Neill left the Foxes to take charge of Celtic four years ago and his spell at Parkhead has coincided with Levein's time at Tynecastle. O'Neill has been impressed by Levein's achievements in making Hearts the third club in Scottish football's pecking order and recommended him to Leicester. If, as expected, there are no problems with the negotiations, Levein will be the latest Scot to manage the Foxes, following the likes of Matt Gillies, Jock Wallace, Frank McLintock and Mark McGhee. With Leicester having apparently filled their vacancy, Glenn Hoddle has emerged as the favourite to fill the post at West Bromwich Albion. The former England coach is at the top of the chairman Jeremy Peace's shortlist to succeed Gary Megson and the parties are already understood to have made contact, even though Hoddle is currently in Spain. Hoddle's agent Dennis Roach indicated that the former Spurs midfielder would be interested in rekindling his managerial career at The Hawthorns and added: \"He is contactable and I presume would be interested.\" Hoddle has been out of work since being sacked by Tottenham 13 months ago but is highly thought of by newly-promoted West Bromwich Albion's board, not least because he meets all Peace's criteria. At 47 he is seen as the right age, a skilled coach who favours playing attractive football, and one who has extensive experience of managing at Premiership level with Chelsea, Southampton and Tottenham. Another point in his favour is the inclusion of the former Swindon Town manager John Gorman in his back-room team. Gorman is highly respected at The Hawthorns after spells assisting their then managers Denis Smith and Brian Little."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
