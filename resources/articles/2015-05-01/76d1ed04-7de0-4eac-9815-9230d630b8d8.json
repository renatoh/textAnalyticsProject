In order to prevent a repeat of what proved to be a brutal cull of behind-the-scenes personnel in 2009, Carver invited non-playing colleagues to join in a team meeting on Tuesday. \u201cI brought all the staff in,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes that [knowing livelihoods are at risk] can motivate players.\u201d Any professional not prepared to give 100% was asked to exit stage left. \u201cI said: \u2018Anybody doesn\u2019t fancy it, if anybody wants to backbite, if anybody wants to be negative, there\u2019s the door,\u2019\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s head coach. \u201cSteve Stone opened the door, and I told them to leave the room. Not one person got up.\u201d Carver then expressed his annoyance at the criticism he received for giving his players two days off on Sunday and Monday before taking part in a charity golf day for the children\u2019s heart unit at the city\u2019s Freeman hospital. \u201cWe made over \u00a3500,000 for the heart foundation to buy at least five scanners to save children\u2019s lives and I\u2019m proud of that,\u201d said Carver, furious at being condemned by fans for being photographed smiling at the event. \u201cI have a clear conscience.\u201d Alan Pardew\u2019s successor has similarly little patience with those critics who asked why the players were not doing extra training following their collection of one point from 10 games. \u201cFrom a psychological point of view having Sunday and Monday off gave them a chance to clear their heads,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, you need that, maybe some of the staff needed a bit of time away from it as well. It\u2019s been intense, and maybe I needed a bit of a break because it\u2019s been even more intense for me. Sometimes, the break is better than coming in and just going through the motions. What\u2019s the point of bringing them in just for the sake of it?\u201d Moreover he believes now is the time for the carrot rather than the stick. \u201cI don\u2019t think bringing in them just to tear a strip off them would have achieved anything,\u201d said Carver. \u201cThat\u2019s definite. I did that after the Leicester game, and you can\u2019t really say it worked. You can only do it so many times. You have to try to find different ways of dealing with different situations.\u201d The responsibility of avoiding \u201cthe unthinkable\u201d weights heavily. \u201cI\u2019m only sleeping about four hours a night,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about turning my phone off, you get so many messages, good messages, but it can wear you down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
