I'll get on to the specifics in a second, but for the moment it's worth celebrating the fact \u2013 not quite tear streaks celebrating, but certainly a relieved wipe of a sweating brow \u2013 that the BBC seems to be getting this so right. Coverage of the Olympics so far \u2013 and let's admit that we're only one proper day in \u2013 has been near perfect. It's almost as if they deliberately put in a bottom-drawer team, a truly bad drawer, the broken one holding chewing gum, an ex's broken menthol Consulate and a single particularly thick unwashed sock, to cover the earlier jubilee pageant, just so they could take some relatively takeable flak and then shout this weekend: \"Look! We can do this and do it well! Up, frankly, yours, illiterate online pigs' tojos!\" It was clear from the very start of coverage on Wednesday \u2013 the torch-carrying Gloriana barge down the Thames and the women's footie in Cardiff \u2013 that the whole corporation's team has either very good knowledge or very good crib-sheets, or most likely both. Sometimes too much information, astonishingly: I didn't really want to learn from Sophie Raworth that the purportedly rowed Gloriana had secret electric thrusters, to help it turn; I didn't really need to know from Gabby Logan in Wales the individual left/right foot preferences of every single player, but it was certainly great to find presenters knowing things, and paying attention, and pulling in the occasional expert such as nice old rower Jock Wishart, who not only explained sculling and such but also, having been let into some secrets about Friday's extravaganza, came out with the fabulously accidental, very British, \"But if I told you, you'd have to kill me.\" It's just struck me that the women are winning. Not necessarily, yet, in the stadia, but certainly in the studios. Sophie, Faye White, Gabby of course, Clare Balding, though we haven't seen enough of her yet, and so far supreme among them Hazel Irvine, who must already be exhausted. During Friday night's troop-through ceremony, Hazel managed to inform us of, among many, many other things, the provenance of the blue stripe on Gambia's flag, Hungary's traditional power in water polo history, the threat of each Finnish javelin-thrower and the inside-leg measurements of Daniel Craig (just joking, but it wouldn't have surprised me). The women are loving doing this and being good at it, and the men are so far limited to doing a bit of hand-waving handover choreography, and then grunting. Gary Lineker, who deservedly took some poop this week from Jamie Oliver for continuing to advertise crisps inedible except by fat people, hasn't disgraced himself further yet, but Guy Mowbray and Trevor Nelson could just do with some wit. You go, girls: calm, fun, knowledgeable, relatively ego-free \u2013 it's your year. The odd thing is that the BBC, while quite happy to big-up its \"named\" anchor/commentators, is very slow, certainly onscreen but also on red-button, online and whatever seventh dimension my remotes currently deny me, to mention the names of some very clever chaps and women who commented, for instance yesterday, on the cycle pursuit, on the badminton and on the sculls. There's a swift \"commentary by mumble mumble and twitchy bumble\" at the start, and yes, look, I know I could find their names online but life's short, and two of my buttons now no longer work through overuse and mild anger. We had tremendous nuanced knowledge on how far the \"peloton\" was behind Mark Cavendish's charge, how the early bunch-up hindered and what the Germans might be devising: the entire mad tactical excitement of the last 30 minutes all immeasurably enhanced not just by helicopter shots but by a couple of sharp British cycle commentators who knew precisely how the seconds, the wind and the angle would change the result. Similar stuff with the shuttlecock stuff. When the BBC has commentators who truly know what they're talking about, they should let us know who they are. So, your moment from Friday night? Personally, it's a toss-up between the Kaos signing choir for deaf and hearing children singing the National Anthem perfectly, when I think most people hadn't fully taken in the French voiceover informing us that they were all deaf (a difficult key to sing in), and the realisation that when Kenneth Branagh as Brunel looked with awe at the forged-steel rings in the sky, he wasn't acting. Nor were the rest of the cast: there were genuine tears, good tears, at who we are, how strong and silly we are, what we've done, what we still will be, and long may they rain over us. It's perhaps the last thing we'll all watch together at that record number of 27 million. Now the sports begins and we can, if we so choose, watch 18 different screens and laptops and phones and red-button remotes simultaneously for a fortnight, and then presumably sleep for a year. But on Friday, 27 million Brits watching so much talented brilliance, utterly altered seven years of cynicism in my mind, which is going some, and I suspect those of a good few others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
