Sometimes overlooked, and still something of a puzzle, are its attendant globular star clusters, many of which climb high above the plane of the galaxy as they orbit its centre. Most congregate in the part of the sky that lies towards the galactic centre, 27,000 light years away in Scorpius. Often called simply globulars, they hold hundreds of thousands of stars, sometimes a million or more, in a near-spherical form, with the stars packed closer together as we approach the core. They range from a few tens to perhaps 200 light years across and some may contain a central black hole. Typically, the stars within globulars are ancient, born in the early Universe when elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were scarce. Such old stars also predominate in the central regions of many galaxies. The puzzle concerns the origins of globulars. Were they always associated with the Milky Way, perhaps as a by-product of its formation 13 billion years ago? Or are they the core regions of small galaxies that were captured subsequently and have seen their gas and dust stripped away during repeated passages through the galactic plane? Our Milky Way \"owns\" 160 known globulars, of which the two brightest are naked-eye objects in the southern hemisphere. The two most recent additions have been found by a survey using the British-built VISTA telescope at the European Southern Observatory's Paranal Observatory in Chile. Working at infrared wavelengths, VISTA can peer though and beyond the gas and dust that obstructs our optical view towards the galactic centre. The prominent globular in the right side of our image from VISTA is UKS 1, while one of the new globulars, VVV CL001, is the small knot above and right of the bright star towards the left. To appreciate VISTA's power, it is interesting to note that UKS 1, itself discovered by a British telescope, was previously the Milky Way's faintest known globular."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
