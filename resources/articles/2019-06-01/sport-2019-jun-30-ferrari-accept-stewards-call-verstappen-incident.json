The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, supported the stewards, saying he believed it would have been incomprehensible to have changed the winner. His Ferrari opposite number, Mattia Binotto, believed the stewards were wrong in choosing to take no further action but that his team would not pursue it any further, having done so fruitlessly after Sebastian Vettel took a penalty at the Canadian Grand Prix. \u201cWe still believe this is a wrong decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe Charles was not at fault, a collision has happened and he has been forced off the track. Having said that we respect fully the decision of the stewards. They are the judges, we need to respect that, and more than that, as a Ferrari fan \u2013 and I am an ultimate Ferrari fan \u2013 I think it\u2019s time for F1 to turn the page and look ahead.\u201d Binotto went on to praise Verstappen for coming back from seventh to win. \u201cWe often said we should leave drivers free to battle. So we may not be happy about the decision but we understand the fact we need to move forward,\u201d he added. \u201cOverall that\u2019s good for F1. So bravo to Verstappen, he did a fantastic race today, as did Charles, but there will be new opportunities.\u201d Horner supported the verdict. \u201cThe stewards made absolutely the right choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was fair racing, hard racing. It was what F1 should be. It would be incomprehensible if they were to change the podium after a race like that.\u201d Verstappen insisted he had done nothing wrong in his attempt to pass. The Dutchman, speaking before the decision was made, was adamant the incident was simply racing. \u201cWe had little contact midway through the corner,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my side it\u2019s racing. It\u2019s hard racing. It\u2019s better than just following each other and having boring racing.\u201d Leclerc, however, thought the move was unacceptable. The pair had gone wheel to wheel with one another on lap 68, which the Monegasque believed was tough but fair, in contrast to their clash a lap later. \u201cI did the same thing from the first to the second lap. The only thing that changed was on the second lap there was contact, and then I had to go wide and lose time ,\u201d he said before the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think the second one was [fair].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
