My friends and I laughed so much we completely ruined the show for half the audience. They were deeply enraged, which only made it funnier. The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 The Fast Show\u2019s Johnny Nice Painter. I found this funny as a child and now as an adult with a few breakdowns under my belt I find it even funnier. The funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 LOL: Australia on Amazon Prime Video. It\u2019s a competition where the winner is the last person to laugh, presented by Rebel Wilson, with 10 of Australia\u2019s best comedians. It captures some of the anarchic weirdness I missed from the fringe this year. The funniest person I know \u2026 My granny Minnie sings novelty songs from the late 90s when she\u2019s had a few to drink. If someone tries to discuss anything that paints her in a bad light she\u2019ll just sing Afroman or the Bloodhound Gang until they go quiet. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Probably from my uncle John Paul correcting me on an anecdote that he was not involved in, so I told the audience an embarrassing story about him instead. Turns out, though, it was my cousin Anthony that heckled me, but they were very far away so poor John Paul got the heckle bullet there. The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned \u2026 A T-shirt with the logo of the meal-replacement service Huel on it. The thought of making eye contact with other fellow Huel T-shirt wearers tickles me. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve had \u2026 I glued blue hair extensions into my hair with a hot glue gun to look like Lisa from Steps in the Heartbeat video. Instead I took a trip to A&amp;E. The funniest number \u2026 32: it looks like a swan eating ass, I\u2019ve a lifetime ban from Mecca Bingo and no regrets.
