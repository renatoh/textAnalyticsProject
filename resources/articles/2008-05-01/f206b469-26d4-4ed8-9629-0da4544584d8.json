How high a priority is IT investment - and if it isn't a priority, then should it be? Some governors wrestle with these questions, but others would prefer not to delve too deeply into IT issues. This may be, in part, because the average governor is aged at least 40. We hardly got to grips with calculators when we were in school, never mind interactive whiteboards and plasma screens. . We may be able to get by at work, and at home there is always a manual - or a child - to assist with the Sky+ box and the PS2. But, given the responsibility of being on a team that decides on technology to serve hundreds of students, well, that's a whole new dimension. Becta, the agency that promotes learning through technology, wants governors to be more engaged in getting the most out of IT for their schools. Its chief executive, Stephen Crowne, says that governors do not need to be IT experts, but they do need to know what questions to ask; and they need the confidence and tenacity to keep pressing until they get all the answers. Writing in the National Governors' Association's Matters Arising, he says: \"After staffing costs, investment in technology is often the biggest expense in a school budget. Schools can - and must - do better. But how? As custodian of the school's ethos and guardians of the purse strings, tasked with monitoring standards and ensuring budgets are met and money spent prudently, this is a critical question for governors.\" Crowne urges governors to assess what technology is already used in school. Becta has a free self-review framework that can help with this. Earlier this year, his agency launched a campaign called Next Generation Learning that aims to draw in parents, teachers and pupils to improve their use of IT. The campaign followed a Becta survey two years previously which found that only 20% of schools were making the most of technology - even though most parents thought their child's school was making best use of it. \"There is a gap between what parents think about the way schools are using technology, and the reality - we need to close that generation gap,\" said Crowne at the launch of the campaign. Governors are going to have to work hard to close that generation gap, but we are letting everyone down if we don't get our heads around it now. \u00b7 You can find out more at nextgenerationlearning.org.uk.
