I work in a customer services call centre dealing with credit card issues. It's not the most lively job and I quite often work 12-hour shifts, so by Friday I'm ready for some excitement. The re-enactment world is very male dominated, mainly because a lot of it is military-based. When I first started, the group I wanted to join didn't accept women. But when they saw that I was better than any of them on horseback - I've been riding since I was four - they let me in and since then I've made a name for myself. There are only three women in the country who do re-enactments at this level - but there have been so many strong women in history I feel it's important to tell their stories. Over the years I've learned to ride sidesaddle and joust, and also gained skills in mounted falconry, mounted archery and arms games. I've also done classical dressage displays in 17th-century costume. Most recently I've started playing a lady highwayman in a show for English Heritage. It's a loosely historical pirates and highwaymen romp, and the most fun in the world. I get to gallop around firing guns and sword fighting on horseback. Despite appearances, re-enactment is not glamorous at all. It's incredibly hard work. As well as remembering cues and handling the weapons (all real or replica and pretty dangerous), I need to be fit. My Elizabeth I costume looks gorgeous but it also weighs about three stones. On top of that I spend most of the summer driving my horses round the country in a lorry and I've had some spectacular riding accidents. Despite all that though, it's the most fun in the world. I don't really tell anyone at work what I do because on the odd occasion I've tried they either didn't get it or didn't seem to believe me. Little do they know what a thrill I'm having. All things being equal I'll still be doing this when I'm 80 - by which time I guess I'll be about ready to play Queen Victoria.
