Apologies. Black is the new black... Alek Wek usually smiles on the catwalk. This is because, she says, her round cheeks prevent her from doing a typical model's grimace when she faces the photographers. But at the Baby Phat show in New York on Saturday night, trussed up in a ridiculous metallic halterneck dress, Wek was actually laughing. The largely non-fashion front row, present because the wife of the Def Jam record label founder Russell Simmons is the label's designer, cheered her in apparent celebration of the increased visibility of African models. To Wek it must have been funny, because modelling is nothing new. She has been walking and posing for eight years now, quietly increasing in visibility along the way. Sometimes the strongest breakthroughs happen by stealth. This is how it has been for Wek, who was born in Sudan, and what is happening now with fashion's current favourite supermodel, Liya Kebede, who is from Ethiopia. Naomi Campbell has obviously been here before, but her famously difficult temperament often saw her cast as a diva, that often negative black stereotype, even though her poise and beauty regardless of skintone were the reasons for her success. Wek and Kebede are different because they are just doing their job, not asking for acceptance as black models, but just being models who happen to be black. I became aware of Kebede a couple of seasons ago, noticing that this very calm-looking woman made each outfit appear as natural as the confines of the catwalk could allow. In the end, that is all you want at a show, as we are really just there to see the clothes. Kebede doesn't appear to be seeking fame, but will soon be one of those models whom you will recognise without knowing who she is. This summer she signed a contract as the international face of Estee Lauder, which is one of the industry's biggest gigs. For such a traditional American brand to have a black face selling its cosmetics means that in some respect acceptance already exists. Indeed, it is now no great shakes for a models to be black - Gucci, for example, has a virtual unknown in Nadine Willis as its new face - but this increasing equality in fashion's most public side is not reflected behind the scenes. Of all the labels and brands that clog the schedules in New York, Milan and Paris, I can think of no major designer who is black. And that is a sad situation. The careers of Wek and Kebede are a triumph, but there is still a long way to go. Charlie Porter ...and the new yellow If you are walking through an American city and spot a London-style black cab, and then do one of those head-turning double-takes normally accompanied in cartoons by the extended \"boing\" sound of a spring being uncoiled, you might like to know that it's all Larry Smith's doing. They may not go south of the river, but London taxis have crossed the Atlantic ocean, all because of a European holiday Smith took after deciding to sell his chain of bakery stores several years ago. \"I said to myself before I went that if I saw a consumer product I thought would do well in the US, then I would investigate the business feasibility of that product,\" Smith recalls. He didn't have to wait long. The family hired a taxi to the airport from their Boston home. \"But my wife, who does not pack lightly, packed our suitcases, and our bags didn't fit in the trunk... No sooner did I get off the plane at Heathrow into a taxi, where the four of us sat comfortably in the back, and there was room for all the luggage, than I said, 'This is what I want to do.' \" Thus was born London Taxis of North America, which has so far begun delivery of 26 cabs, with another 100 orders waiting to be filled - most for use as taxis in Chicago, Virginia, greater New York, and even Detroit, the car capital of the world. Arnold Schwarzenegger has purchased one too. (\"He doesn't have it yet, but we have his deposit,\" Smith says.) It took almost three years to perfect the American model, moving the steering-wheel across, installing airbags, increasing the amount of seatpadding. But LTNA's publicity literature works hard to emphasise the Englishness of the vehicle - the headroom, it explains, is because of an English law requiring taxis to accommodate gentlemen's top hats (\"and the Queen's crown,\" the Detroit News added, overexcitedly). The $45,000 model is called the Civilised Taxi; the $49,000 version, with leather seats, is the London Executive Sedan. This is an England, frequently invoked in America, where taxi drivers know every inch of their terrain, where the superlative of choice is \"smashing\" and where they are, above all, impeccably polite. (\"Although sometimes I can't tell,\" Smith concedes. \"To the average American, all Englishmen seem polite.\") The plan seems to be working. American Express has bought wraparound advertising on some cabs, and Smith aims to be shipping 3,000 a year soon, spreading a little civility as he goes. \"It's a professional piece of equipment,\" he explains. \"When you give an operator a professional piece of equipment, they in turn treat the equipment differently and they treat the customer differently,\" he says. Smashing! Oliver Burkeman I was David Hill's bass player The annals of rock music are littered with characters whose sole claims to fame concern fleeting associations with legends of the genre. Mine is more Spinal Tap than Woodstock. I was David Hill's bass player on two of the most bizarre tunes ever committed to vinyl. Until yesterday I had reason to hope that the incident would never be remembered. I thought every copy of The Stopits' unique double A-side, Return to Sender/Oh, Stop It was hidden or destroyed. I was wrong. Forgive me, David. It does not do you justice. It happened like this. In 1988, I was a 25-year-old assistant to Donald Dewar. The man who has replaced Alastair Campbell was chief of staff to Labour's deputy leader, Roy Hattersley. Then Margaret Thatcher introduced the poll tax. I suggested recording a song in opposition. Dewar liked the idea. He introduced me to the Labour MP Brian Wilson, who had friends in the music business. Within days we had studio time and had rewritten the lyrics to Elvis Presley's Return to Sender and the Rolling Stones' Carol. I was in a band with John Ludlow, research assistant to George Robertson. Our drummer was keen. We lacked a singer. Over buns in the Strangers' cafeteria at Westminster, David Hill declared that he was a rock vocalist. He said he had performed in a student production of Hair. I was sceptical, but we had rehearsal time booked and there was no obvious alternative. David was booked for an audition. When he stepped up to the microphone to deliver the first verse of Walkin' the Dog I almost dropped my guitar. It was electrifying. The prime minister's new help has a voice that blends the gruff depth of Joe Cocker with the melodic sensibility of Ry Cooder. We made the single, were filmed by Newsnight (May 1988 - please tell me the tape has been destroyed) and played a full set at the Half Moon in Putney. David Hill can strut, preen and belt it out better than many professionals. He held the audience in the palm of his hand and the lyrics in the back pocket of his jeans. Downing Street is home to a man who knows The Stones' back catalogue intimately and does a belting version of Janis Joplin's Me and Bobby McGee. If Tony will learn some chords and Bill Clinton can take time off the primary campaign to contribute a saxophone, John Ludlow and I are available for party conference. If Tony wants to sing one, I propose The Smiths' Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now. Tim Luckhurst I'm carbon neutral - are you? \"People are very keen on our crop plantation in India, and also on our Scottish forests,\" says Dan Morrell, founder of Future Forests, with the purr of an experienced sommelier. In fact, Morrell is reading a kind of menu of sustainable forests, planted with the financial help of some of the world's premier recording artists and Hollywood stars, all of whom wish to go \"carbon neutral\" - that is, to counterbalance the carbon dioxide produced in the making of their latest record or cinematic blockbuster. \"It was just me on my own at first, now there are 20 of us,\" recalls Morrell, proving perhaps that big trees from little acorns grow. He was backstage at Glastonbury in 1996, making idle chit-chat with Joe Strummer, when the conversation drifted to the amount of carbon produced by all the bands and the roadies and the falafel vans accumulated by the festival. They enlisted the assistance of Dr Richard Tipper from the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management. \"We figured out that 2.5lbs of carbon dioxide was produced in the making of a single CD.\" Thanks to the continued efforts of Morrell, over 50m CDs are now carbon neutral, and some 2m trees have been planted worldwide. In Britain alone, Morrell and co have planted more than 90 forests, between Tunbridge Wells and and the Isle of Skye. Worldwide, there are Future Forests - planted at a cost to the carbon emitter of \u00a310 per tree - everywhere from Mozambique to Mexico, via the Andy Warhol forest in Florida. The Rolling Stones stadium tour is the first to be carbon neutral - 90% of the carbon generated is in fact by fans' travel to the stadium, so for every 57 fans who attended a concert, a tree will be planted and reach maturity. The Brit awards have now been carbon neutral for three years - covering not only the carbon dioxide produced by the show itself, but also by the 5m television sets flickering across the land. \"It amounts to the planting of six Wembley-sized forests around Britain,\" says Morrell. To \"neutralise\" the carbon emissions of their latest album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, Coldplay opted to plant some 10,000 mango trees in India - mangoes, Morrell points out, have the added bonus of providing a harvest, so that the people of Bangalore also have a product they can sell. \"Coldplay fans can buy a tree in the mango forest. You get a certificate and a map showing where your tree is sent to you through the post,\" he says. \"And yes, of course it is printed on recycled paper.\" Laura Barton"}, "isHosted": false}}}
