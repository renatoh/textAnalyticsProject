What comes to mind? Building bridges in Chile? Lying on a beach in Thailand? These days, anything is possible. Taking a gap year before university is more popular than ever. Many school and college leavers feel they deserve a break from an increasingly stressful education system. It can be the perfect way to broaden your perspective, forget about exams, and prove to yourself that you can cope with whatever life throws at you. If you can survive a solo trip around India, the chances are you'll be able to deal with student life. We have all heard the arguments against taking a gap year: \"You're too young\"; \"You can always travel later on\"; \"It's self-indulgent\"; \"You'll only be adding to your student debt\". But many employers favour graduates with a gap year behind them. \"We take on around five trainee writers and researchers each year,\" says Claire Smith, deputy editor of Legal Business magazine. \"An important part of the CVs that lead to interview is a demonstrable commitment to a life that's broader than the corridors of one's college library.\" Well-structured gap years can improve your employment prospects, indicating that you are self-reliant, resourceful and able to solve problems. Time out after university can also be rewarding, but many students are now so heavily in debt that immediate job-hunting becomes the only credible option. The gap between school or college and university is the ideal time to do something completely different. One excellent starting-point is the Year Out Group website, which lists the major gap-year providers. A wide range of options is on offer, including expeditions, courses, voluntary posts and cultural exchanges. From five-week history of art courses in Italy to tree-climbing in the Amazon, you're bound to find something to suit you. Gap Activity Projects (Gap) is the largest of the organisations that send gap-year students overseas. Established in 1972, it sends around 1,750 young people to over 30 countries each year, on placements that range from teaching assistant to conservation worker. Applications are accepted throughout the year. Each placement lasts three to six months. As is usual with such organisations, volunteers must raise the money for the trip themselves, through a combination of paid employment, fundraising events, sponsorship and school funds; the average cost is around \u00a32,000. Former \"gappers\" bear witness to the scheme's success. \"All I can say about the gap experience is that you will have the most fantastic time of your life,\" says Laura Price, who worked in Brazil. James Burlton spent time as a volunteer in India. \"My time with Gap boosted my confidence and independence in a way that little else could have,\" he says. Another well known organisation is Raleigh International. Over 20,000 volunteers have travelled abroad with Raleigh since it was set up in 1984. Like Gap, Raleigh provides training and orientation. Expeditions last three months and are based in countries such as Borneo, Chile, Ghana, Namibia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. You might be building a school, or tracking an endangered species. If Prince William can do it, you can. John Paterson, 18, who has a place to study biology at St Andrews next year, decided he wanted to work abroad for a longer period. He applied to Project Trust, which offers placements in 25 countries for eight or 12 months. After completing two compulsory five-day selection and training courses on the Isle of Coll in the Hebrides, he is about to embark on a year-long teaching placement in British Guyana. \"I'm very excited about gaining some independence,\" he says. \"I will be helping people at the same time, which makes it all worthwhile. Obviously I'm nervous - a year is a long time - but I wanted to immerse myself in another culture and this seemed the way to do it.\" But don't think only of what a gap year could do for you. \"School-leavers should not be inflicted on the third world for three months to have a jolly time and meet their friends at the weekend,\" asserts Project Trust director Lavinia MacLean-Bristol. \"Short-term volunteering raises ethical issues. Young westerners often arrive in underdeveloped communities with insufficient training and little cultural awareness; the danger is that they might impose their values on these communities. We try to avoid this through intensive preparation and relatively long-term placements.\" Now a second-year student at Edinburgh, former volunteer John Gibson worked as a teacher in a Vietnamese university. \"It took a while to learn the language and settle down,\" he reflects. \"By the end of the year, I had become a part of the community. One of my fellow teachers even cooked her pet dog for me to eat before my de parture. Dog meat is a delicacy in Vietnam, and I felt honoured. If I hadn't lived there for so long, I might have been horrified.\" Another popular option is simply to travel, either alone or with friends. This can be the perfect opportunity to escape all ties. Nick Thompson, 20, is now a student at King's College London. \"I travelled alone around Australia and New Zealand for six months, and had a great time,\" he says. \"I didn't want to be organised by anyone.\" He rejects the suggestion that independent travel is more self-indulgent than volunteer work. \"The whole idea of travelling in your gap year is to learn to cope on your own, and to have a good time. The trip was basically a wonderful extended holiday. People talk about saving the world or finding themselves, but if they're honest, most of them just want to have fun.\" Annie Smith, now 24, explored New Zealand with Kiwi Experience. She recommends the tour to those who would like some structure while travelling. \"They sort out your accommodation and activities, but it's not a set journey. You stay in each place as long as you want and just catch the next bus.\" And you can always combine travel and work. Nineteen-year-old Oxford student Basher Savage travelled around South America, Australia and south-east Asia, but far more rewarding for him were the four months he spent working as an assistant consultant with a hotdog company in Moscow. \"If you're going to do the gap year thing, try to immerse yourself in another culture and learn the language,\" he advises. \"Working abroad changes you and helps you to grow. Diving off the Great Barrier Reef and exploring the Brazilian jungle were amazing experiences, but I felt more like a tourist. I was just looking, rather than touching.\" If you are planning to travel, you'll need to save some money. Thousands of student-friendly jobs, from bar work to modelling, are advertised at www.hotrecruit.com, which also has a section that is dedicated to gap-year opportunities, including ski-resort jobs in Europe and turtle monitoring in Mexico. Another option is to find some work experience. The Year in Industry offers paid work experience in industry, providing business training as part of the deal. Most work experience is unpaid, but a few weeks with a local business looks good on your CV. If you plan the year well, you may have enough time and money to combine work experience, paid employment and overseas travel. Whatever you decide to do, make the most of this unique opportunity. You won't regret it. Gazing out of your office window in a few years' time, you might just look back on your gap year and realise how lucky you were. CF Feel it's all a bit much?

He took a gap year before university, and split his time between travelling in south-east Asia and working in a hotel to earn some money. \"I applied to Leeds partly because of the course, and partly because I knew I wanted to live there. When I decided, after I had applied, to take a gap year and go travelling I had already accepted it as my first-choice place for that year. \"It was really easy to defer my place, though: I just phoned them up and they asked me to confirm it in writing to the admissions secretary. I did drop a grade when my results came out, but luckily the course wasn't oversubscribed and I was still accepted. \"I had a lot of reasons for taking a year out. Being a student can be expensive, so I wanted to have some financial security before I left home. Working full-time also helped me learn how to handle that money, which helps when everyone goes fresher-crazy with their loans. Saving up to go travelling, too, was a great focus, and the travelling itself was incredible. \"I spent three months in Thailand with my girlfriend, backpacking around the country. Having the opportunity at 19 years old to spend months exploring the other side of the world was great. It was also a useful break for me between studying to take stock and prepare for the next three years. \"Far from being reluctant to return, I have found it much easier to commit to my course knowing that I had taken a year to be certain I wanted to be there. I'll definitely be travelling again when I graduate.\" Nina Baglin Year Out Group www.yearoutgroup.org Gap Activity Projects www.gap.org.uk Raleigh International www.raleigh.org.uk Project Trust www.projecttrust.org.uk Tree-climbing in the Amazon www.greenforce.org Kiwi Experience www.kiwiexperience.com Year in Industry www.yini.org.uk History of art courses in Italy www.arthistoryabroad.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
