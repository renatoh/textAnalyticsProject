He was probably shot by one of his guards,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Koen Vervaeke said. The Belgian officials gave no further information, and the report could not be confirmed. Belgium is Congo's former colonial ruler. Asked about the report, Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji said: \"The Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs can say what he wants but I will make my announcement tomorrow.\" A member of Kabila's security entourage said on condition of anonymity that the bodyguard had shot the president in the back and right leg. Kabila was alive and was being treated by doctors, he said without elaborating. French diplomats in Paris also said they believed Kabila had been shot but was alive. Intelligence officers in Rwanda said they had unconfirmed reports that Kabila was killed in the intense shooting at the presidential palace, which lasted half an hour. Rwanda supports rebels fighting to topple the Congolese strongman. Kabila's government would not be publicly drawn on their president's condition, or even whether he'd been shot. \"President Kabila is alive and everything is OK,\" said Congolese General Francois Olenga. The conflicting reports came hours after witnesses told of 30 minutes of gunfire around the home of Kabila, who has been fighting multiple rebel armies for more than two years. It was unclear who was responsible for the shooting. A presidential helicopter landed at Kinshasa's main hospital, a government official who witnessed the event said, adding there were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft was carrying Kabila's son, Joseph Kabila, who had apparently been injured. The younger Kabila is the head of Congo's military. Presidential aide Eddy Kapend went on national television shortly after the gunfire ended to appeal for calm, but he made no mention of the incident. The bleary-eyed Kapend ordered that all airports and borders be closed, appealing to the armed forces and civil society leaders to help maintain order. \"The Congolese people need your serenity and your discipline,\" he said. Later, an 8pm to 6am curfew was announced by Kakudji as having being ordered by Kabila himself. Kakudji also put all fighting units in Kinshasa on alert until further notice. In the neighboring Republic of Congo, a senior military official said it was unclear who was in control of the Kinshasa government after Kabila was wounded. The official declined to be named. Amid the confusion of the shooting, Kinshasa residents hurried home and many streets were quickly deserted. Truckloads of armed soldiers patrolled the streets in the capital city of the vast Central African nation. Large numbers of troops in armored vehicles and on foot blocked off roads near Kabila's hilltop residence not far from downtown Kinshasa. The presidential residence, known as the Marble Palace, is usually heavily guarded by troops and a North Korean-made tank. As darkness fell, a tense calm enveloped the capital. Kabila has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by Kabila's former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. In the war's early stages, the rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Speaking from Brussels, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, a spokesman for one of the main rebel movements insisted Kabila was dead. \"It was a palace coup. Soldiers from Kabila's escort fired at him. He took bullets directly. Immediately, the doctors took him to the main hospital, but he died.\" Mulumba said the shooting proved that the Congolese people wanted a change, but denied that rebels had anything to do with it. \"Something big happened in our country this afternoon. People want change,\" he said. Kabila came to power in May 1997 following a Uganda- and Rwanda-sponsored rebellion against former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the nation then called Zaire.
