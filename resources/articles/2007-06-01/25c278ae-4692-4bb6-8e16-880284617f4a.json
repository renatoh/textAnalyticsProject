It needs it. As Jack Straw, the leader of the house, told us, some of the rules are utterly arcane and baffling. For example, many debates are \"on the adjournment\", meaning that technically they're discussing not education or the public finances, but whether or not they should adjourn. Then before they actually do adjourn they have an adjournment debate. As Mr Straw put it, \"we debate going home. Then we spend six hours not going home. Next the whip withdraws the motion. Then he changes again, and we spend 30 minutes debating whether we should go home. Then we go home.\" The committee, which held a press conference yesterday, wants to make parliament snappier, quicker on the uptake, more in tune with the times. They realise that they are no longer the centre of public discussion. Television has taken over. If their suggestions are picked up, there will be topical slots for questions - which now have to be tabled days in advance. There will be instant debates on big issues of the day. Because the public has no attention span, statements and speeches will be much shorter. And \"hand-held electronic devices\" - now strictly banned - will be allowed, so that MPs can catch up with their emails, or even porn sites, while waiting to speak. Or while they speak. As in, \"yeah, it's me, I'm on a train of thought\". And they would be able to text each other. Instead of sycophantic praise, they can send a msg saying \"u wuz gr8!\" Rather than adding to that unseemly bellowing across the chamber, they can write electronically \"f u wnkr\". In general, what the committee are trying to do is to turn the chamber into a rival 24-hour rolling news service, packed with snippets, interviews, and a trailer running constantly along the bottom of the screen: \"Breaking Views: Sir Nicholas Winterton 'minded' to vote against amendment 5, sub-section (b).\" The Speaker will have to be joined by a comely young woman, who shakes her tresses and smiles a lot. The idea will be to generate \"sexual tension\" between her and Mr Martin. They will also introduce reports from outside. \"Over now to Public Bill Committee number 3, looking at the Paperclips and String General Provisos Bill. On the spot, Denis MacShane. What's the atmosphere like there, Denis?\" \"Very, very tense, Nadine. We've got a big vote coming up, and it really could go either way. We'll be standing by here for the latest and we'll bring it to you as soon as it happens.\" Mr Martin will interrupt MPs. \"I'm sorry, that's all we've got time for. Now, with all the sport, here's Dick Caborne!\" In short, it will be horrible. We should bring back three-hour speeches like in Gladstone's day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
