In an open letter, more than 20 figures from industry and commerce have called for the next Tory leader to back the project in full. It comes amid speculation that the next prime minister \u2013 with Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson now the final two MPs vying for the position \u2013 could decide to axe the second phase of the project due to concerns over spiralling costs. Johnson is reported to have asked a former boss of the \u00a356bn scheme to carry out a review if he is made prime minister, while Hunt has said HS2 is \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d and he would not scrap the project in its entirety. Signatures of the letter include the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses and London First, the BBC reports. \u201cWe assert that committing to HS2 in full, once and for all, will spread the flow of investment across the Midlands, the north of England and into Scotland,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe current poor connectivity in the north is a major obstacle to encouraging companies from growing in the region and is a barrier to inward investment.\u201d Work is under way on phase one, which will connect London and the West Midlands, although the full scheme would extend to Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. The letter comes after dozens of newspapers and websites across the north joined forces to call for Britain\u2019s main political parties to commit to invest more in transport in the north. Speaking to the Yorkshire Post on Saturday, the cabinet secretary David Lidington, Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, said her successor must \u201creassert a continuing priority for the Northern powerhouse\u201d. He said: \u201cI think this is important economically but I think it is also important in terms of the cohesion of the country as a whole. \u201cIf cities in the north of England feel that they are being left out and left behind then the country is going to feel more divided.\u201d Labour has accused the government of repeatedly breaking its promises on transport investment in the region. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has called for the Northern powerhouse to be \u201cmore than a slogan\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
