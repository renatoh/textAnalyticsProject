After storming into the final of ITV's Britain's Got Talent tonight the 48-year-old even managed a little victory jig for good measure before telling show hosts Ant and Dec: \"What pressure \u2013 I really enjoyed myself, I enjoyed every second. I'd do it again!\" Boyle, from Blackburn, west Lothian, Scotland, has won legions of fans, including Demi Moore and Jon Bon Jovi, with her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream. Her first performance on the programme has received more than 60 million hits on the video site YouTube. That fanbase helped her win the public vote last night after another towering performance of a show classic, this time Memory, from musical Cats. Tonight's show was the first of five live programmes over the next week during which 40 acts will be put to the public and judge's vote with just two from each show going through to the grand final next Saturday. The acts are all competing for the chance to perform at the Royal Variety Show and win a \u00a3100,000 cheque. Dance group Diversity and 10-year-old Natalie Okri received the next biggest share of the public vote and had to face the judges' decision. Amanda Holden threw her weight behind Natalie but Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan voted for the dancers. Before the vote, Diversity, a 10-strong group from Essex whose members are aged between 13 and 25, were showered with praise from the judges for their routine which took in a pastiche of the Tom Cruise film Mission Impossible, a surfing scene and a blast of Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal. Another act who did not make it through to the final was violinist Sue Son who ditched her original musical partner at the request of the judges. Nick Hell, who puts himself and his piercings through a variety of unpleasant stunts was stopped from completing his act when the judges used their buzzers to halt proceedings before he could show what he planned to do with a chainsaw and an apple. More than 200 people watched Boyle sing her way to the finals from a community centre in her home town. Local councillor Alison Kerr, who organised the event, said the hall erupted in \"pandemonium\" as soon as she appeared on screen. \"The atmosphere was absolutely electric, really fantastic,\" she said. Bookmaker William Hill has cut Boyle's odds of winning to 8/13, the shortest price in the show's history. Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond said: \"She has Scotland behind her. I'm sure she's got what it takes to be a winner in next week's final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
