Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s quest to locate the various manifestations of our collective apocalypse-anxiety might have been written with the long hours of global lockdown in mind. \u201cIt was the end of the world, and I was sitting on the couch watching cartoons with my son,\u201d he begins. He proceeds like Noah sensing rain in the air. O\u2019Connell\u2019s previous book, To Be a Machine, was an inspired journalistic exploration of \u201ctranshumanism\u201d, the subculture that wants to fast-forward to a technological future in which man becomes part-machine. This one is haunted by the idea that, unless we change our ways, or even if we change our ways, our species does not have much of a future at all. For O\u2019Connell, those fears had been sharpened by recent fatherhood. There are competing voices in his head. One insists, \u201cwe are alive in a time of worst-case scenarios\u2026 Attune your ear to the general discord and you will hear the cracking of the ice caps, the rising of the waters\u2026 Is it not a terrible time to be having children, and therefore in the end, to be alive?\u201d Another voice counters, \u201c[but] when in the scheme of things was it ever a good one?\u201d A third \u2013 generally prompted by his wife \u2013 argues for a bit of perspective: \u201cI was not John of Patmos\u2026 this was a house and people were trying to live in it.\u201d O\u2019Connell has a gift for channelling the \u201csense of looming crisis\u201d that characterises our times, but is able to step outside it, to bring it into focus. This project began for him toward the end of 2016, that disabling year, when his therapist suggested to him that \u201cit might be helpful not to spend quite so much time following the news\u201d. His response to that suggestion was a kind of personal aversion therapy: he would not shut himself off from the portents of end times that buzz-alerted his phone, but follow them to the ends of the Earth. To this end, he tracked down \u201cpreppers\u201d for apocalypse purchasing bunkers in South Dakota; he listened in to those disciples of Elon Musk who believe our best hope is colonising Mars; he self-isolated in Alladale, the re-wilded retreat in the Highlands of Scotland; and he journeyed to New Zealand, the promised land of doom-harbingers everywhere. If there is a thread running through these travels, it is that knotted relationship between Silicon Valley plutocrats and our collective unconscious. As O\u2019Connell shows, the billionaires of digital media seem particularly in thrall to a coming apocalypse, and to lavishly self-indulgent strategies to survive it. Perhaps it is because outrageous fortunes give them control-freak dreams of immortality. Perhaps it is because they understand the darker implications of the monsters they have created. O\u2019Connell exposes their schemes with a likable zeal. His journey to the post-apocalypse hideaway of PayPal founder Peter Thiel is in itself a wonderful piece of journalism, in which he traces Thiel\u2019s obsessions \u2013 with disaster capitalism, cryogenics, surveillance technology, The Lord of the Rings \u2013 to a piece of real estate on New Zealand\u2019s south island. Like Louis Theroux cast in Heart of Darkness, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel\u2019s private lake. \u201cI was drinking apocalypse water, symbolically reclaiming it for the 99%,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf in that moment I could have drained Lake Wanaka just to fuck up Thiel\u2019s end of the world contingency plan, I might well have done so.\u201d The disaster scenarios the quest is concerned with are mostly the terrors of climate change. Pestilence hardly gets a look-in, although you are occasionally given pause by prophetic allusions to our current circumstance. One surprising voice co-opted into Musk\u2019s belief that we need to colonise Mars as a \u201cbackup planet\u201d is Stephen Hawking, who argued that \u201cto stay [on Earth] risks annihilation. It could be an asteroid hitting Earth. It could be a new virus\u2026 For humans to survive, I believe we must have the preparations in place within 100 years.\u201d As a premonition of that post-human planet, O\u2019Connell visits the Chernobyl exclusion zone. He joins an annual 36,000 tourists on a guided tour of unimaginable catastrophe. What he sees there is less \u201ca barely conceivable tragedy of the very recent past, than a vast diorama of an imagined future, a world in which humans had ceased entirely to exist\u201d. They wander the abandoned town of Pripyat as if it were Pompeii, unearthing children\u2019s drawings in crumbling schoolrooms. Inside a vast unfinished cooling tower next to the Chernobyl plant, he watches a pair of kestrels looping high above and reaches for biblical reference, the \u201cblood-fevered edict of Isaiah\u201d, of the land lying desolate for eternity, \u201ca haunt for jackals, a home for owls\u201d. In some ways, experiencing this abyss, this holy of holies for catastrophists, acts as something of a catharsis for O\u2019Connell. Having looked on these human ruins, he finds himself, counterintuitively, resisting Ozymandias-like despair. What brings him back to life is the birth of his second child, a daughter, who arrives with their home in Dublin in the midst of a \u201cstatus red weather warning\u201d. Her presence, that \u201ctiny engine of joy\u201d she represents, is beautifully evoked by O\u2019Connell, in passages that capture exactly that mixture of impossible vulnerability and responsibility, the enforced mindfulness of new parenthood. The prophet that has provided the most comfort to him in his journey has been Dr Seuss, his son\u2019s hero, and in particular those words from The Lorax, that indelible primer in apocalypse and its unlikely flipside, hope: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d He picks those words up again here, not in any mawkish way, but as a clear-eyed rejoinder to the implications of what he has witnessed in his three-year odyssey. Among other things, O\u2019Connell is good at dramatising the way we turn things over in our minds. Tentatively, sporadically, he finds he is losing his taste for nihilism, that insistent thrum of doom that shadows social media habits. \u201cLately, I have been glad to be alive in this time, if only because there is no other time in which it is possible to be alive,\u201d he says. O\u2019Connell\u2019s journey to this realisation \u2013 though hugely engaging - does not always make comfortable reading with the world grinding to a halt outside, but he leaves the reader with that word, which offers the gift of making any future possible: \u201cunless\u201d. \u2022 Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back by Mark O\u2019Connell is published by Granta (\u00a314.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
