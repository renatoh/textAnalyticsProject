A week earlier I had taken our daughter to a ski shop to get kitted out for the slopes and, in the manner of a typical three-year-old, she absolutely refused to try on any of the ski suits. Or the snow boots. Or the gloves, goggles, thermals etc. She wanted girly pink or possibly purple, but they came in only red, blue or yellow. Which are boys' colours. Apparently. Anyone with a daughter of similar age will know it's pointless to argue, so I simply guessed her sizes and bought the stuff anyway. But as we trudged home, exhausted from the struggle, I wondered how I was going to get Emelye on to skis if I couldn't even get her to try on socks. Fortunately, as soon as she saw the snow she jumped into her (blue) ski boots, shoved on her (red) gloves, grabbed her hired (yellow) skis and was ready to go. Within an hour of arriving at the resorts, she was sliding down the nursery slopes into her dad's arms. Although I'd never considered skiing in Norway before and, to tell the truth, I'd never even heard of Geilo (pronounced 'yaylow'), I had been told that it was very child-friendly and that the ski schools in Norway had an excellent reputation for teaching youngsters, particularly as all the instructors spoke good English. I was a bit concerned that, at three, Emelye was perhaps a little bit too young to ski - especially as the entry age for most ski schools is four - but Thore, the manager of the Vestlia Skicenter in Geilo, said not. 'Some take to it at two-and-a-half, others refuse to ski until they're six or seven,' he said. 'What is important is not to force them to do anything they don't want to.' As he told me this I overheard Emelye loudly telling her dad she wanted to go right to the top of the mountain and ski down 'ON MY OWN'. It was with some relief that we handed her over to Wilfred, a gentle Californian ski instructor who was Geilo's Best Male Ski Instructor 2000-2001 and, since their first lesson together, is now Emelye's new best friend. By the third lesson she was riding the button lift on her own and zooming back down the nursery slopes by Wilfred's side, dutifully following his instructions to touch her knees and her head and reach for the sky to keep her balance. I was so impressed with Wilfred that I pinched him for an afternoon and it was the most-fun ski lesson I've ever had. It can't be denied that Norway is cold. Very cold. Temperatures during our week in early February swung between -2 and -7 and on the days when the wind nearly whipped us off the ski lift it felt much colder. To be fair, the sun did shine, but it was too weak to thaw my nose, which was the only bit of my body left uncovered. On the plus side, the snow lasts until May, which makes for a long ski season. The skiing in Geilo is pretty limited, however. There are only a couple of dozen runs in the main, south-facing ski area and a further seven on the opposite side of the resort, plus a couple of scary-looking snowboard parks and a Boardercross Park. A free ski bus links the two ski areas, but there are just three departures in the morning and three return trips at the end of the day. There are plenty of taxis, but the five-minute trip costs \u00a36. Geilo is picturesque though and, as it is still relatively undiscovered, the slopes are virtually empty - other than at weekends, when the Norwegians arrive in droves - and lift queues are a rarity. And when you get a fresh fall of snow - I'm sorry to tell those of you who went to the Alps last year but, boy, did we get some snow - at least you know you'll have the powder all to yourself. There's also lots to do in the resort apart from skiing, including dog sledding, sleigh rides and snowmobiling. We tried the first, which was fantastic. I sat in the sledge with Emelye and her little brother Luke on my lap while their dad stood on the back and (supposedly) steered the pack of wild-eyed huskies as they pulled us through a pine forest at the edge of a beautiful snow-covered lake. We also took an evening horse-drawn sleigh ride around the resort, which was nice, but tame in comparison. If you're bored with downhill skiing there are plenty of cross-country trails, or you could try telemark - after all, when in Rome... We stayed at the Quality Vestlia hotel, at the foot of the slopes, which has big family rooms, baby listening in most of the bedrooms, a children's playroom and an indoor pool - although this was too cold for my liking. Another big selling point for Geilo is the resort cr\u00e8che, or barnehage, which is located at the Vestlia ski station, just a short stagger in ski boots from the Quality Vestlia hotel. A big log cabin with gingham curtains and stuffed with toys, it is every parent's dream nursery. Diana, the nanny, was just fab, which meant we could leave Emelye and Luke with her every morning without even a twinge of guilt. In fact, although Emelye really took to skiing - we took her on to the nursery slope for half an hour or so every afternoon and by the end of the week she was attempting to turn unaided - I think she enjoyed her time in the barnehage just as much. Wilfred might have the status of New Best Friend, but she now refers to four-year-old Timothy, who she met in the nursery, as 'my husband'. Factfile Seven nights staying in the Quality Vestlia hotel in Geilo costs from \u00a3569 (departing on 12 January), including flights, transfers and half-board accommodation with en-suite bathroom. Six days' ski and boot hire costs \u00a352 for adults, \u00a342 for children and \u00a343 for youths. A six-day lift pass costs \u00a369 in low season, \u00a381 in high season, and between \u00a345 and \u00a355 for youths. The ski school costs \u00a365 for five two-hour sessions. Childcare costs from \u00a3125 for five days. Snow update Snow of the week Late last week rain brought slush to the lower slopes of many European resorts, but there are great piste conditions in higher resorts, especially in France, Italy and Switzerland. Austrian resorts, in particular, need some fresh snow. Although windy, Chamonix (10/250cm) and Tignes (75/185cm) in France have excellent piste conditions. Saas-Fee (65/210cm), Switzerland, has good skiing, while snow over the New Year has left the Italian resort of Cervinia (60/160cm) in fine fettle. Massive snowfalls in the south-west of the United States have left great conditions - at Heavenly (157/172cm) there has been more than 12 feet of snow since the middle of December. Whistler (125/184cm) is in pole position north of the border. Deal of the week Scott Dunn (020 8682 5050; www.scottdunn.co.uk) offers a week's stay at the Chalet Belmont, M\u00e9ribel, in France, from \u00a3495 departing 12 January: including flights, transfers, meals and wine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
