The manager said: \u201cI called her yesterday and she was obviously disappointed. That\u2019s her mentality and her character. She is a winner. She missed the last camp because of Covid restrictions and other players have been playing really well. They have gone to a level that is really impressive and they have earned that right to come into the squad.\u201d Duggan, who will be 31 by the time of the Euros in 2022, faces a fight to keep her international career alive. She scored her last England goal during World Cup qualifying in August 2018 and struggled in France the following summer on her return from injury. She made two substitute appearances and one start at the SheBelieves Cup in March of this year. \u201cToni is still a big part of what we want to do,\u201d said Neville, who believes the pool of players from which he is picking has grown from 20-25 when he started in 2018 to \u201c35, maybe 40\u201d. Another player omitted from Neville\u2019s squad, for the second time, is the Euro 2017 golden boot winner Jodie Taylor. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it,\u201d said Neville of whether the 34-year-old will play for England again. \u201cIf you look at the competition for places in that centre-forward position, it\u2019s fierce. \u201cAge doesn\u2019t come into it for me; it\u2019s whether your performance is good enough and the performances have got to be better than those that are in the squad.\u201d Looking to the future, Neville has called up Manchester United\u2019s centre-back Millie Turner and forward Ella Toone, the Manchester City defender Esme Morgan and the Chelsea winger Niamh Charles after the quartet impressed at their first camp in September and continued to shine in the Women\u2019s Super League. Returning to the squad are the Lyon forward Nikita Parris, who was unable to travel to St George\u2019s Park last month because of Covid travel restrictions, and the Manchester City right-back Lucy Bronze, who has retuned from injury. England are \u201cat the start of a journey\u201d of building towards the Euros and 2023 World Cup, Neville said. Germany, ranked No 2 in the world behind USA, will be the first of two tough tests before Christmas for Neville\u2019s side, who play Norway at Bramall Lane on 1 December. Germany lost against Sweden in the quarter-finals of the 2019 World Cup. \u201cWhen we were building for the World Cup, they were blooding some young players,\u201d Neville said. \u201cSo they\u2019re ahead of us in their journey at this moment in time. But my expectation as a manager is I want us to compete, I want us to put on a performance and I expect to go for the win. That\u2019s not going to change whoever I put out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
