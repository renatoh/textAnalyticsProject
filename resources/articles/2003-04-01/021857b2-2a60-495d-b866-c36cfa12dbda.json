More than 50 UK travel websites offering potentially misleading deals have been uncovered in a worldwide search of the internet. The OFT and 55 UK local trading standards authorities were among the 87 agencies in over 20 countries that took part in the study. The OFT survey was part of a worldwide investigation by the International Consumer Protection Network. More than 1,000 websites were discovered to have potentially misleading offers. Initial analysis suggests that 40% (54 out of 135) of British websites visited during the search were found to be similarly inaccurate. The claims now under investigation include: \u00b7 \"Hot deals\" on a front page which bore no resemblance to the prices of the holiday actually available on the website. \u00b7 An advertisement stating \"Australia from \u00a3599\" when the cheapest price was \u00a3891.60. \u00b7 An offer of seven nights in Austria in March for \u00a399, when the cheapest price was \u00a3259. \u00b7 A claim of \"up to 70% discount off worldwide hotel rooms\" with no further mention of any savings or discounted deals. \u00b7 A special offer of \u00a364 per person per night with certain conditions when it could not be booked for less than \u00a3128 pppn. \u00b7 The UK-based sites identified are being pursued either by local trading standards authorities or the OFT with a view to taking further action. OFT chairman John Vickers said: \"The internet is a valuable and expanding resource for consumers and for business. \"Online shoppers must have the same protection afforded by the high street, and if traders breach fair trading law, the OFT will pursue them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
