That cause inspired him to co-found the Centre for Social Justice and brought him back to frontline politics, despite his bruising experience in the leader\u2019s chair. Ultimately, it also led him to resign from the government on Friday, as his frustration at what he saw as endless obstruction from the Treasury boiled over. All former cabinet ministers find that the transition to the backbenches leaves them with spare time and energy. Some write books, some go on the speaking circuit and others commit it all to seeking a route back to the top table. Duncan Smith will presumably commit to the campaign to leave the European Union, a cause which has long been close to his heart. That\u2019s not to say he will stop talking about social reform and start talking about Brexit \u2013 rather, he has a unique opportunity to explain why a Leave vote would help Britain become a fairer society. The early skirmishes of the referendum campaign have largely focused on either macro-policy, like international trade rules, or micro-frippery, like the views of the monarch. As the debate gets into full swing, both sides will need to explain how their preferred outcome will directly affect voters\u2019 day-to-day lives. Welfare and work are an essential part of that picture \u2013 and there is an as-yet-unheard case that both could be improved by voting to leave. Duncan Smith has long argued that constructing a fairer society requires money and the freedom to reform the welfare system. Leaving the EU would provide both. Ultimately, the referendum in June is about control \u2013 control of our laws, our public policy and our public spending. On each front, EU membership compromises Britain\u2019s ability to act freely and flexibly to address its social problems. The government itself sought through the renegotiation to regain power over who can claim welfare in the UK. The two central requests were set out in the Conservative manifesto \u2013 that benefits should not be paid for those children whose parents work here but who do not themselves live in this country, and that new arrivals should work for four years before they become eligible to access the welfare system. These were modest and popular demands, endorsed in a general election, but the EU still rejected them, watering down each so heavily that the process more closely resembled policy homeopathy than a renegotiation. That failure sent a clear message about the reality of EU membership \u2013 we have lost the right to define the rules of our own welfare state, and have thus lost the ability to manage its costs or focus its resources as we wish. Whatever your preference might be regarding the size and nature of the welfare system, it is hard to argue that the voters who fund it and use it should not have democratic control of its terms and scope. During the renegotiation, Duncan Smith identified the four-year waiting period before migrant workers could access benefits as \u201ccrucial\u201d, and with good reason. With a stubbornly large deficit, there is no unlimited source of money for the welfare state; therefore, the greater the number of people who have the right to claim benefits, the less money there can be for each recipient. If one argues, as he does, that a permanent improvement in the lives of those in the greatest need requires the allocation of sizeable up-front resources, then allowing unlimited access to in-work benefits for EU migrants reduces the opportunity to deliver a new life for those in the direst need. One of the passages in the work and pensions secretary\u2019s resignation letter which will have caused the most pain in Downing Street will be the charge that the government\u2019s fiscal priorities are skewed \u2013 not least that they protect benefits for better-off pensioners while cutting from the young. That argument, too, can extend to our EU membership \u2013 it is both absurd and unjust to pay such vast amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money to Brussels while battling to reduce spending on public services at home. All the political agony and fury of the coalition years saw a total of \u00a317bn saved from the welfare budget. And yet last year our gross contribution to the EU exceeded \u00a319bn. Even if a post-Brexit government wanted to continue all EU spending \u2013 an unlikely circumstance given the wasteful way in which Brussels spends much of our money \u2013 that would leave a net saving of over \u00a310bn. Duncan Smith would be justified in arguing that it is more socially just to take money from well-paid Eurocrats than from British welfare recipients.
