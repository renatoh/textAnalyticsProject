The Times and the Guardian endorse Cameron and Clegg respectively. And the last remnants of this crumbling government glare balefully at the 42-inch elephant in their election room. TV, with its three portentous debates and Rochdale excursions, dominated every waking moment of the campaign. The rest of the media pack were spear-carriers, cheerleaders exalting the great gods of Sky, ITV and BBC. Did press circulations take a sudden boost as the contest changed? Not particularly: nothing much moving on the newsstands. Did the hype for Facebook, Twitter and the rest add up to much? The sum total of active tweeters for debate number three was 33,000 \u2013 much the same as a mid-table Premier League crowd \u2013 for a programme watched by eight million. Brute reality here was a political spin-off from reality TV, your actual X factor. It turned Nick Clegg from zero to hero in 90 minutes (then began, 180 minutes later, to peripheralise him again as even Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian began to find his \"holier-than-the-other-two act a little tired third time around\"). It scoffed at Gordon Brown, with his funny eye and grisly grin. It wiped the smile off David Cameron's moonface, then gave him a second chance to be loved. Who won? Don't ask the audience: ask YouGov and the rest. What does winning \u2013 amid vacuous chat about \"knockout blows\" \u2013 actually mean? But will we be able to avoid Britain Needs Talent 2 in five months' or five years' time? Not a chance. The media election game is changed forever. That means that the next round of would-be leaders will have to endure some weird physical scrutiny. Do David Miliband's ears stick out too much? Isn't Ed Balls a bit of a pudding? Call for a body-language expert. But it also means that most election coverage \u2013 in print, on the radio, even on television itself when old lip-curlers like Paxman do their stuff \u2013 is far less important. You have three men in suits on a podium: you have multi-coloured worms crawling across screens and Ipsos MORI on hand to dish out instant laurels: you don't even need to watch for long, if at all. This is the spectacle that supposedly tells you all you need to know (in your busy, hard-working lives). The rest, haplessly but inescapably, because this is the nature of television itself, is 60 seconds here or 30 seconds to reply there. It can't tell you what's important and what's not. It can tweet for Obama one moment and bury him in abuse the next. It makes mugs of excited political editors as they build up poor, bemused Gillian Duffy to Belgrano status \u2013 then find that Gordon's gaffe has altered nothing, that Joe Public met a pollster, shrugged and went out for a beer. The public sparring of party leaders on television, rather than in the bear pits of Westminster, represents progress of a kind. The phenomenon of millions of voters tuning in to politics has millions of good reasons going for it. But it's what it leaves out that matters. Anne Applebaum in the Washington Post asks: \"What would the Tea Party movement look like if it was British, privately educated and had once worked as a ski instructor in Austria?\" Her answer: \"It would look like Nick Clegg.\" Ian Traynor in the Guardian writes about Jean-Marie Le Pen's comeback in French local elections, a great new surge for the anti-immigrant Northern League in Italy, a 25% poll rating for Geert Wilders's grimy Freedom party in Holland. And it's not so far, either, from Arizona to Rochdale (probably on the Athens bypass). Our economic crisis is shared, not separate. Our fears and resentments \u2013 whether simmering with the BNP in Stoke or taking a share of power in Budapest \u2013 are shared as well. Newspapers still set the agenda (on Europe, education, the bomb and the future) between elections, though not when the day of decision arrives. Television, teetering between fairness and balance, is a consensus medium. If we're stuck with reality TV as the end point of democracy, then we need to start from somewhere better, with horizons that fit. That sounds like a project, not a tweet. We know where we've got to this time around. Now it's next time that counts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
