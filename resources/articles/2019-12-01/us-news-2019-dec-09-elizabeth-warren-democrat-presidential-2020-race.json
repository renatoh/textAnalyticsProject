The Massachusetts senator made her views plain in an interview with the Associated Press in Charleston, South Carolina, on Sunday. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d she said. \u201cI think [voters] would support a lot of different combinations.\u201d Warren was speaking in the week the California senator Kamala Harris, formerly seen as a strong candidate for the nomination, dropped out of the race. Warren has fallen back a little in polling but remains in a clear top four, with former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. \u201cLook, it would be presumptuous of me to be talking about individuals, but I\u2019m open to getting this right because that\u2019s what we want to do,\u201d Warren told the AP when asked about her theoretical choice of running mate, a little less than two months out from the Iowa caucuses. \u201cWe want to build a Democratic ticket and a stronger Democratic party that\u2019s ready to get out there and compete at the national level, at the state level, at the local level.\u201d Some suggest another woman would be a mistake, given Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat by Trump in 2016. The AP said Warren \u201cargued that women notched historic wins during the 2018 midterms, suggesting voters are worried less about gender than the message candidates are offering\u201d. The senator has said she would consider Harris as a potential running mate. Many in the party favour Stacey Abrams, now campaigning for voting rights after narrowly losing the gubernatorial election in Georgia last year. Warren also told the AP she would be \u201copen\u201d to considering Biden for the role he played under Barack Obama. In an interview with Axios also released on Sunday, Biden said he would be open to considering Warren. Biden said he would want someone \u201cwho knows that you and he or she are totally simpatico in terms of your ideology, where you want to take the country, your vision for the country, and you have to be able to turn over significant responsibility to them.\u201d Ideologically speaking, that would seem to count out Warren, who differs with Biden significantly in many policy areas, most conclusively healthcare. But the former VP acknowledged it would be valuable for the Democrats to have a woman or a person of colour on their ticket. \u201cI\u2019d add Senator Warren to the list,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d add all. But she\u2019s going to be very angry at my having said that ... The question is would she add me made to her list. You know.\u201d Now he knows. Regarding the actual campaign, Warren told the AP she was not concerned about Biden\u2019s strong position in South Carolina, a key early voting state, and with African American voters in general. She also criticised the billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg over his late entry and said the party needed to attract disillusioned Republican voters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need as many Democrats as we can to build up our turnout,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re also going to need some Republicans to help us, some Republican women, some Republican men, who are turned off by how Donald Trump behaves. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a path to victory, and I think the energy and enthusiasm of women is really what\u2019s going to carry us across the finish line with a good margin.\u201d Women, Warren said, will \u201cnot only help us win the White House but, just as has been happening, help us win up and down the ticket\u201d. Warren seems confident she can head that ticket. In a column published by the Guardian on Sunday, she took Trump to task for his \u201creckless\u201d behaviour on the world stage, particularly at the Nato summit in London last week. \u201cA mounting list of global challenges demand US leadership and collective action,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs president, I will recommit to our alliances \u2013 diplomatically, militarily and economically.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
