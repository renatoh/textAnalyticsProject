Her biggest rival on the tongue-in-cheek show is a certain Ronald Stump. \u201cHey dummy,\u201d he tells her in the trailer, which debuted on Entertainment Weekly. \u201cIs there anything else you can do with your time? Get a real job \u2013 in the home!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been told I need to smile more and act more ladylike,\u201d a young Clinton (played by series co-creator Jessica Cabot) says. \u201cI\u2019ll act like every other woman in history who was told they couldn\u2019t do it because it\u2019s never been done.\u201d The Young Hillary Diaries falls short when it comes to historical accuracy. Clinton is seen attending East Plains High School in the pilot \u2013 and while it indeed exists, Clinton didn\u2019t go there. She attended Maine East High School in Chicago before transferring to Maine South High School for her senior year. During her final year before college at Main South, in Park Ridge, Illinois, she kept extremely busy, according to findings by Buzzfeed. Among her extra-curricular activities, she served as a member of the student council constitutional committee, co-chaired the student council anti-vandalism ommittee, and acted as the director of the Republican organization during a school-wide mock election. Clinton revealed in an interview with Elle Magazine that she had run for \u201cclass president\u201d when she was a senior in high school, but lost. \u201cOne of my opponents even told me I was \u2018really stupid\u2019 if I thought a girl could be elected president,\u201d Clinton recalled. The Young Hillary Diaries will release new episodes on mylifetime.com in the weeks leading up to the November election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
