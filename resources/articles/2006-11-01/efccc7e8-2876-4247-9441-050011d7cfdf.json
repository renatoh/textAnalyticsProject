The World Health Organisation has released figures suggesting that Zimbabwean women live an average of 34 years. A decade ago, the figure was closer to 65, but after years of economic hardship, food shortages and trauma caused by slum clearance and brutal oppression, Mugabe's regime is truly taking its toll on the vitality of the nation. Since the country's last census, in 2002, it is estimated that Zimbabwe's population has fallen by between 4 and 8 million. Despite the fact that up to 3,500 people die each week as a result of Zimbabwe's social and economic \"meltdown\", the eyes of the world remain fixed on areas of conflict in which western interests are at stake. A lesson on the state of Zimbabwe affords teachers an opportunity to investigate the impact of poverty, slum clearance, Aids and government corruption on a nation with historic links to the UK. Dead at 34 Help students to locate Zimbabwe on a map, and supply the class with some basic facts about the country and its leader. Useful information about land use, population, climate and health can be accessed here and here. Older students should be introduced to a timeline of Zimbabwean history. Ask pupils to research one event on the timeline, before preparing the case (either a piece of persuasive writing or a short talk to the class) for why their event should be considered the most important in the modern history of Zimbabwe. Read about the plight of Zimbabwe's women before asking students to draw up a list of differences between the \"old\" and \"new\" Zimbabwe. Encourage pupils to select an image from the article and to use this either as the basis for a piece of creative writing, or as the starting point of a collage of images and text relating to the story. Identify the issues raised in the article that specifically affect women and challenge students to discuss the reasons why women have shorter life expectancies than men. In the maths classroom, compare the statistical information on life expectancy, child mortality and health expenditure in Zimbabwe with the data on the UK population Ask students to represent the differences in these statistics using a range of presentational and illustrative techniques (such as pie charts and bar charts). Older students might like to compare more detailed breakdowns of health information accessible under \"selected indicators\" and \"key health expenditure indicators\". It might be interesting to contrast the life expectancy of Zimbabwean men and women with that of the country's neighbours. Read about life in Mugabe's Zimbabwe here and here. Encourage students to select one of the news stories they encounter in this research and to use it as the basis for a dramatic monologue that seeks to measure the impact of Zimbabwean life on one of its citizens. Creating homeless people A year has passed since Operation Murambatsvina, a slum-clearing initiative in which the government demolished thousands of illegal houses, leaving some 700,000 people homeless. Students can read about the impact of Mugabe's \"cleanup campaign\", while older students might find the Executive Summary section of the UN's report on the situation interesting. Ask younger students to choose one of the statistics featured in the Independent's article on Zimbabwe and to bring it to life using images, headlines, photographs and appropriate data presentation tools. Mugabe's violations of the UN Declaration of Human Rights are notorious. Ask students to visit the online home of Human Rights Watch and to make a list of the threats and challenges facing the people of Zimbabwe. An organisation known as Women of Zimbabwe Arise (Woza) is making an impact by demonstrating against Zimbabwe's worsening economic and social conditions. Read about the work of this organisation here and here before watching a video interview with Jenni Williams, Woza's national coordinator here. Discuss the ways in which these women are risking their lives to make a difference. Zimbabwe's Aids crisis is claiming millions of lives every year. Ask pupils to find out about World Aids Day (December 1) before discussing the ways in which Zimbabwean hairdressers are attempting to make a stand against the spread of the disease. Ask students to consider why the international community has taken a relatively non-interventionist approach to Mugabe's regime, given that more people die every week as a result of Zimbabwe's oppressive social and economic regime than in Darfur, Lebanon and Iraq. Examine the recommendations of the UN report on Mugabe's slum-clearance programme and identify ways in which the international community might help to ease the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe. Given the dangers faced by the citizens of Zimbabwe, should the British government be doing more to help immigrants claiming asylum from oppression and torture? \u00b7 Teachers and students will find a complete KS3 lesson on Zimbabwe on the Guardian's daily online newsdesk for children www.learnnewsdesk.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
