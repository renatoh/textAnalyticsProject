Despite his status as one of the most senior powerbrokers in English football, the FA vice-chairman was not appointed to the nominations committee to find a successor for Lord Triesman, who resigned as FA chairman in May. That decision came after Richards, who is also the Premier League chairman, declined to put himself forward for the committee. Triesman's replacement will be appointed early in 2011 and the responsibility for identifying candidates now rests with four men. Chairing the nominations committee is Roger Burden, the interim chair, and it will feature three FA board members. Either David Sheepshanks or Tony Kleanthous will represent the Football League, Bolton Wanderers' Phil Gartside the Premier League, and the Hampshire FA's chairman John Ward will speak for the national game, alongside Burden. Gartside, Ward and Burden all feature on the FA's remuneration committee and it was felt appropriate that individuals with that experience should have a say. However, it was not a prerequisite \u2013 neither Sheepshanks nor Kleanthous feature on the remuneration committee \u2013 so this was no obstacle to Richards's involvement in the process. Richards was heavily involved in the recruitment of Triesman, however, and his lack of a significant say in the current process is conspicuous. It suggests he is sensitive to the scrutiny of his many roles and has sought to remove the potential for suspicion by stepping away from the process. Elephants at the Beeb Peter Salmon's decision to delay his permanent relocation from London to Salford Quays, as the head of BBC North, highlights how unpopular the enforced migration of BBC departments, including Five Live and Sport, has become. But more pertinent, perhaps, is the question about why it is happening in the first place. BBC grandees such as Roger Mosey and Mark Byford have been heavily involved in designing the layout of London 2012's main broadcast centre. Their staff would much prefer a switch from one end of the Central Line to the other to schlepping the length of the M6 and M1. So why not move in to the Olympic site? It cannot be done, apparently, due to something about needing big departments to relocate to make the Salford move work. But what do 2012 insiders say will be the biggest white elephant after the Games, and the biggest burden on the taxpayer? The broadcast centre, of course. Distraction for Gardner Plymouth Argyle supporters have long been told they should be reassured that the club can call on the business acumen of their chairman Sir Roy Gardner, despite his not taking a salary for the role. He does, though, charge an interest-bearing loan to the business and he and his family and friends also stand to profit if stadium redevelopment plans come to fruition. However, the demands on his time have suddenly been increased. He is also the chairman of Connaught, a company specialising in repairing and maintaining social housing, which unconfirmed reports suggest is the subject of a Financial Services Authority investigation over a director's alleged insider trading. This means that at a time when Plymouth are dealing with a complex transaction separating Home Park from the football business, the club are likely to see even less of their chairman as he deals with embattled Connaught. Triesman's last act Lord Triesman who resigned his FA chairmanship after making unguarded allegations about bribery in rival bids for the 2018 World Cup, last week received an honorary degree from his alma mater, the University of Essex, \"for his contribution to his field\". The biography that accompanied his graduation explained: \"He was also chairman of the 2018 Football World Cup bid team until May this year and one of his last tasks within this role was to help present the technical bid document to Fifa \u2013 football's world governing body.\" It was one of the last things he did as England 2018's chairman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
