Queensland is responsible for more tree clearing than the rest of the country combined, so making good on that promise would go a long way to halting Australia\u2019s growing land clearing crisis. But there is reason to doubt the changes introduced by the Palaszczuk government will bring clearing back down to the levels of a decade ago. Most clearing happens free of any regulation The single biggest reason to doubt the impact of the changes is that most clearing in Queensland happens on land that is not regulated by the law the government\u2019s bill proposes to amend. In the three years between 2013 and 2016, almost 1m hectares of native vegetation were bulldozed in Queensland. Analysis by WWF-Australia\u2019s Martin Taylor found almost two thirds of that \u2013 590,785 hectares, or 63.4% \u2013 was done on land mapped as \u201ccategory X\u201d or \u201cexempt\u201d, meaning it is outside the scope of the Vegetation Management Act. The changes announced last week would have stopped hardly any of that clearing. Under the current laws, land is exempt from regulation if it has been cleared at any time since 1989, no matter how important the regrown forest might be for biodiversity or reef water quality. And landholders were able to lock in those exemptions \u2013 protecting them from changes to the definition of \u201cexempt\u201d \u2013 by asking for an official vegetation map of their property. Once they received that, changes to the definition of exempt land would no longer apply to them. Unsurprisingly, landholders enthusiastically locked in land as exempt, with land clearing consultants and LNP politicians urging them to do so before the new bill was introduced. Official figures, analysed by Taylor for Guardian Australia, show 68% of the land in this category was locked in as exempt from regulation, leaving it free to be cleared at any time. The new laws limit only what land can be declared exempt in the future. And most of the remaining 32% is in areas where almost everything has been cleared and developed anyway \u2013 around Brisbane and the Darling Downs. Nevertheless, the state is so big that substantial areas still remain that are not exempt. Previously unregulated regrowth that will now be subject to some level of protection more than triples, from about 500,000 hectares before the new amendment to 1.8m hectares if the amendments pass. Stealth clearing mostly cleaned up Other proposed changes would affect smaller proportions of clearing. The government has moved to shut down \u201chigh value agriculture\u201d permits which were introduced by the LNP government, allowing landholders to clear land easily if they say they are doing it for purposes such as growing sugar or creating irrigated pasture to fatten up cows. They allowed some of the biggest land clearing permits in the country, and so became a significant point of tension. But they accounted for a tiny proportion of the clearing in the state. According to analysis by Taylor, high-value agriculture permits were behind less than 4% of the state\u2019s clearing. Of more significance were the \u201carea development codes\u201d, which allowed land owners to self-assess their land and clear for a variety of reasons. Taylor\u2019s analysis of clearing between 2013 and 2016 concluded that about 11% of clearing was done under those codes \u2013 about 102,000 hectares. Of that segment, by far the most significant clearing was conducted for the purpose of \u201cthinning\u201d. \u201cThinning\u201d is a form of clearing allowed without approval in most regions, letting landowners take out up to 75% of the trees in an area. The Queensland government describes it as a way of managing \u201cmassive thickening\u201d it says can have adverse effects on the regional ecosystem, and so has presented it as a form of environmental management. \u201cThinning and appropriate follow-up management can return these thickened areas to a state that is more typical for the regional ecosystem,\u201d the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines has said. But scientists have pointed out many native animals can only live in areas that have not been cleared for 30 years or more. And thinning is commonly used as a way of increasing the productivity of land for cattle grazing. The type of clearing conducted under \u201cthinning\u201d codes has often been hard to distinguish from broadscale clearing, and could be so severe that it was counted as cleared land under state and federal accounting. Satellite images and drone footage have revealed \u201cthinned\u201d areas where very few trees were left. The Queensland government has foreshadowed changes to the thinning codes, but has not guaranteed they will go. A media release said the laws would \u201crequire farmers to get approval to thin vegetation,\u201d but the government then released an interim self-assessable code, allowing farmers to continue thinning, although with more oversight required. Self-assessable thinning also lives on in other parts of the legislation, albeit in ways that account for very small areas of clearing. The self-assessable code responsible for the second biggest amount of clearing was one that allowed for \u201cfodder harvesting\u201d. It accounted for 17% of clearing under self-assessable codes, according to Taylor\u2019s analysis. The government has said that will live on, and has released a new code, with some new requirements. But it still allows for bulldozing of significant tracts of land. Reaction from environmental groups Environmental groups that have been campaigning for changes to Queensland land clearing laws have largely welcomed the changes, with some reservations. Having won a significant battle with Queensland Labor, they have been hesitant to be too critical, with several sources saying it was seen as a tactical error to berate the government after it delivered a lot of what they had demanded. The Wilderness Society cautiously described the changes as a \u201cgood first step\u201d. Queensland Conservation Council coordinator Tim Seelig called them \u201can important milestone\u201d and the group said it \u201cstrongly welcomed\u201d the changes, but said they would defer judgement until they\u2019ve studied the bill. \u201cWe will now need to study the bill in detail, and ensure it delivers the strongest possible protections and meets the policy objectives of ceasing remnant clearing and the destruction of ecologically-important regenerating woodlands,\u201d Seelig said in a statement. WWF called the changes \u201ca major step forward\u201d. WWF conservation director Paul Toni noted the group saw \u201croom to improve the bill\u201d \u2013 something he said they would take up with the committee reviewing the bill. The Queensland laws may have wider ramifications, as other states embark on experiments in broadscale clearing. NSW has introduced a variety of self-assessable codes for clearing, mirroring some of those responsible for so much clearing in Queensland. Land-clearing approvals have increased tenfold in the Northern Territory in recent years, and graziers are eagerly eyeing Western Australia for potential developments. If Queensland is able to substantially reduce broadscale clearing, its approach could serve as a blueprint for governments looking to save what is left in their states."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
