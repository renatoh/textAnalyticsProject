Shortly after #warmforwinter notices appeared on lampposts near the popular landmark last week, an array of anoraks, parkas and fleeces started to line the railings. Organisers considered it a practical and symbolic display of solidarity with homeless people over Christmas. However, Dublin city council disagreed and workers removed the coats over the weekend. The action provoked a social media outcry and accusations that authorities wished to conceal homelessness in the Irish capital, especially from tourists. \u201cTheir intentions are simply to hide the issue of homelessness in the city,\u201d said PJ Maguire Kavanagh, an activist. \u201cAny attempt to hide that inaction is swiftly quashed.\u201d The number of homeless people in Ireland has risen to 10,514, including more than 3,800 children, fuelling widespread anger at a housing crisis. A count last month identified 92 people sleeping rough in Dublin. Activists chose the Ha\u2019penny Bridge, an arched walkway over the River Liffey built in 1816, for its national significance and because some homeless people begged on bridges, Kavanagh said. The council said it removed the coats because of concern about pedestrian flows and congestion. \u201cIt is the city council\u2019s duty to protect the public and prevent accidents from occurring on this footbridge, through any restrictions in pedestrian flow, particularly at this time of year when thousands of people use this bridge on a daily basis. \u201cCrowd surges are a particular concern and Dublin city council must, at all times, put public safety first.\u201d It also cited concern that rain would render the coats unusable. The council said the garments would instead be distributed to homelessness services, and urged potential donors to leave clothes at charity shops. Council workers also routinely remove padlocks, or \u201clove locks\u201d, left on the bridge amid concern they can damage the structure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
