Is this correct? Yes, it is. Once an auction sale is made, the buyer has to stump up 10 per cent of the purchase price on the spot, and pay the remainder 28 days later. If he or she fails to pay off the balance within that period, you can sue. Be aware, though, that there are extra costs associated with selling by auction - you will have to pay some of the cost involved in producing the sale catalogue and part of the auction room hire fee, even if your property doesn't sell. Some auction houses are also insisting on vendors providing homeseller's packs, in which case you would have to pay upfront for a valuation survey and various searches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
