A late volley by the Bolton forward Kevin Davies secured a point for the home side after Lee Hendrie had seemingly set Villa on the way to victory with a sublime lob over Jussi Jaaskelainen seven minutes into the second half. However, Allardyce's main concern was Crouch's apparent swipe at Hunt, which left the England Under-21 full-back face down in the six yard box. Hunt had perhaps provoked the towering striker by tugging his shirt seconds earlier, but Crouch's reaction ought to have resulted in him being shown a red card. Messias merely produced a yellow. 'I have seen the incident on the video and Crouch chopped Nicky down. If the referee had seen it, he should have given a red card,' Allardyce said. Whether the numerical advantage would have helped Bolton to victory we will never know, but Villa were clearly the better team and it was only their defensive inadequacies that allowed the home side to claim a point that all but ends any lingering relegation fears at the Reebok. Villa had take the lead on 18 minutes when Crouch stooped past Simon Charlton to head Gareth Barry's cross into the net at the far post. However, following a first-half upsurge, Bolton levelled three minutes into the second half when Henrik Pedersen pounced on a poor defensive clearance by Ulises de la Cruz to send a left-foot strike past Thomas Sorensen from six yards. Hendrie's 25-yard lob over Jaaskelainen, his first goal for 13 months, should have been Villa's match-winner. However, slack defending invited Bolton forward and Davies punished the Midlands side, volleying a Stelios cross past Sorensen four minutes from time to leave Villa manager David O'Leary pointing a finger at his defenders. 'We gave a silly goal away for them to equalise early in the second half, and then had to suffer a double whammy when we let them score another stupid goal right at the end. 'Hendrie's goal was terrific. I was ready to criticise him for taking the shot on, but it was a good run and good finish, but we should have held on to the lead,' O'Leary said.
