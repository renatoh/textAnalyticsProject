Chelsea travel to the same venue on November 23, prompting worries of heavy-handed policing that might provoke a reaction from otherwise peaceable Chelsea fans. Though the Liverpool supporters were all later released, the Football Intelligence Unit, which recently moved to the Home Office from the National Criminal Intelligence Service where it was previously housed, has led the calls for less heavy-handed policing. \"We are seeking advice from the Belgian authorities with regard to the rationale behind the exclusion zone,\" said the Home Office in a statement. \"We are interested to know the legal basis behind the tactics deployed.\" Police in the Anderlecht district of Brussels said that laws introduced for the European Championship in 2000, which Belgium co-hosted, had been invoked in the arrest of the Liverpool fans. \"The football law, which has been in application for some time, dictates that a supporter who is not in possession of a valid ticket is committing an offence to be in the vicinity of the ground,\" said a spokesman. The British Embassy in Brussels is also understood to have entered into discussion with local police. But the Belgian authorities said they had no plans to relax their policing policy for Chelsea's visit. \"The football law is in place for all matches,\" added the spokesman for Brussels police. There is a history of zero-tolerance policing towards English football fans in Belgium. During the European Championship clashes between England fans, German and Turkish supporters and police in Brussels and Charleroi led to 584 Britons being arrested. At the time Brussels' assistant commissioner of police Christian de Coninck described Belgian authorities as having been \"too soft\" on hooligans. In addition, memories of Chelsea's Cup Winners' Cup visit to Bruges in February 1995, during which approximately 1,000 fans without valid tickets for the match were deported, have made next month's Champions League Group G match particularly sensitive. \"Chelsea supporters are worried that innocent fans will be mixed up in this and be deported,\" said David Johnstone of the Chelsea fanzine cfcuk. \"Anybody who remembers what happened in Belgium 10 years ago will be worried about this.\" The Liverpool arrests came as a surprise to Merseyside police, who had four officers travelling with Liverpool fans. \"Merseyside police are aware that 74 LFC supporters were arrested in Brussels before the match [on Wednesday] kicked off,\" said the police force in a statement. \"We have liaised with the Belgian authorities who are dealing with the incident which is believed to relate to ticketing issues. All those arrested were taken to a police station and later released.\" According to customary practice, Liverpool fans were kept behind in the stadium for 20 minutes while home supporters dispersed and were thanked by a message on the public address system for \"their impeccable behaviour before and during the game\", which Liverpool won 1-0 with a goal from Djibril Ciss\u00e9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
