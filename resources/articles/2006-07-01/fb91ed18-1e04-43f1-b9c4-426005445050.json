Kylie Minogue", "bodyText": "The homepage of Limbo - \"the ultimate Kylie Minogue fansite\" at kylie.co.uk - declares: \"She's back!\" Next to the headline are links for donations to the Kylie Minogue breast cancer fund, and for sales of a charity book of fans' tributes. Hardcore fans were not alone in celebrating the news last month that Ms Minogue's breast cancer is in remission. When she first appeared on TV screens in 1986 - playing the tomboy mechanic Charlene Mitchell in the Australian soap opera Neighbours - no one would have predicted that she would still be news 20 years later. Kylie turned out to be more enduring than the media and the public generally allow. Over the years she moved smoothly from teenage actor to pop idol to dancefloor diva, rivalling Madonna for her ability to reinvent herself. In 2001 she finally shook off the vestiges of teen stardom with a platinum album, Fever, that sold 6m copies worldwide. Ms Minogue's latest endurance, though, is not one she would have chosen. Since she was diagnosed as being in the early stages of breast cancer in May last year, at the age of 36, Ms Minogue has been an inspiration to the women who have had to face the horrors of the disease. Throughout the travails of chemotherapy and a partial mastectomy, Ms Minogue remained dignified and impressive. Her openness and honesty caused a surge in young women applying for checkups. In an era when celebrities make mountains out of molehills, Ms Minogue has shown what true celebrity is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
