More of England\u2019s young people are getting stuck in the small towns where they grew up or went to university because they cannot afford rent in cities or regional hubs where wages are higher, says the Resolution Foundation thinktank. It has found the number of people aged 25 to 34 starting a new job and moving home has fallen 40% over the last two decades. A person on average earnings in Scarborough paying average rent would have been 29% better off by moving to Leeds in 1997. In 2018, rising rents and stagnant wages mean the benefit is 4%. Moving from Sunderland to York in 1997 would have been worth a 6% rise in earnings after rent, but would now result in a 24% fall. The phenomenon is not just affecting the young. Someone working in a school in Cornwall, for example, would be considerably poorer moving to a similar job in Bristol. The findings come alongside Affordable Housing Commission research that 43% of all renters are facing affordability problems and 5.5 million are unable to buy their own home. * * * D-day anniversary \u2013 World leaders will attend ceremonies today on the beaches of Normandy, where 75 years ago Allied troops landed to push Nazi forces out of France. On an occasion that will mix politics with poignant historical remembrance, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will first meet Theresa May to launch the construction of a British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. Macron and Donald Trump will hold private talks followed by a working lunch after a ceremony at the US military cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer. The site overlooking Omaha beach holds 9,400 graves \u2013 representing 40% of the American forces killed during the weeks of fighting that followed the D-day landings. Tens of thousands of French and foreign visitors have converged on the Normandy coast for this year\u2019s commemorations to honour the dwindling number of firsthand witnesses to the fighting. Justin Trudeau will attend a ceremony at Juno beach, where Canadian forces were in charge of the assault. On 6 June 1944, now known as the \u201clongest day\u201d, 156,000 troops landed on the beaches chosen for the D-day invasion, most of them American, British and Canadian. It remains the largest amphibious assault in history, claiming the lives of an estimated 4,400 troops in the first day alone. * * * Bad news for Bridgend \u2013 Ford is planning to close its Bridgend engine plant in Wales, with the likely loss of about 1,700 jobs. The announcement is expected today at the plant, which has been making engines since 1980. Cost-cutting by Ford across Europe, the end of the plant\u2019s contract to make engines for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), and of course Brexit are thought to be factors in the decision. Honda has announced the closure of its Swindon plant in 2021 while Nissan has scrapped plans to built its X-Trail model at Sunderland. JLR, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, is also cutting jobs. The Unite union is due to meet with Ford management this morning. * * * Trump tramples Troubles \u2013 Donald Trump has managed to compare Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit border dilemma to the US border with Mexico. The US president, sitting next to a visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border.\u201d Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall. \u201cI think you do, I think you do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way.\u201d The awkward meeting at Shannon airport took part amid a heavy police and security presence in Ireland with the visit by Trump, unpopular in the country, the subject of protests in Shannon and Dublin. Today, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to his currently barricaded golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and then going home. * * * Centre-left to lead Danish government \u2013 Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats have claimed victory in parliamentary elections with 25.9% of the vote. The centre-right Liberals of outgoing prime minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen reached 23.4% while the populist, far-right Danish People\u2019s party (DPP) plunged to 8.7% \u2013 less than half their tally in the last election. The Social Democrat-led \u201cred bloc\u201d of leftist parties won 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, against 75 for Rasmussen\u2019s rival \u201cblue bloc\u201d. Mette Frederiksen, leader of the centre-left Social Democrats, says she intends to form a minority government with ad hoc support of other parties. Denmark\u2019s mainstream parties have in recent years adopted hardline anti-immigration policies previously the preserve of the far right. Frederiksen has defended her party\u2019s backing for many of the restrictive immigration measures passed by the outgoing government, mostly instigated and supported by the DPP. Most of the other \u201cred bloc\u201d parties do not back the Social Democrats\u2019 immigration policies, so coalition-making looks tricky. * * * Surrogacy reform overdue \u2013 Laws governing surrogacy should be updated to allow intended parents to assume the status of legal parents as soon as a baby is born, rather than having to wait months, according to the law commissions of England, Wales and Scotland. Their consultation recommends ending the requirement for intended parents to have a genetic link to the child. Profit-seeking surrogacy agencies should remain banned, the commission\u2019s report suggests, while calling for public views on surrogacy payments. The consultation also calls for a national register allowing those born through surrogacy access to information about their conception. Current surrogacy laws are unchanged since the 1980s. * * * Fish and scripts \u2013 The Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey is looking for a new GP. Dr Katherine James has announced she will be handing back her contract to run the local surgery on 31 July and it is feared 5,300 patients will be forced to travel elsewhere for treatment. The town has launched a campaign \u2013 hashtag #willyoubemygp \u2013 aiming to woo doctors with picturesque, winding streets, friendly folk and superior fish and chips. In a campaign video posted on the Cornwall Channel, a crowd of residents chant: \u201cBe our GP. We are a lovely community. We need you.\u201d Dr Marlene Behennah, Mevagissey-born and a doctor at the surgery for 30 years until 2002, said she was \u201cvery very sad\u201d the surgery might close. \u201cI mean, this is my life\u2019s work.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: China\u2019s other Tiananmen Squares Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, discusses reporting on the hundreds of other Chinese cities that were involved in the student protests in 1989. And: Patrick Wintour on Saudi Arabia\u2019s involvement in Sudan\u2019s military crackdown. Lunchtime read: Lies, damned lies and economics The familiar political explanation for rising economic inequality is the huge shift in economic and political thinking, in favour of free markets, during the reigns of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It fits the facts \u2013 across developed economies, the biggest rise in inequality since 1945 occurred in the US and UK from 1980 onwards. But that explanation, writes Jonathan Aldred, is too top-down: it is all about what politicians and other elites do to us, and looks like a convenient myth that lets us avoid thinking about another possibility: that through our electoral choices and decisions in daily life we have supported rising inequality, or at least acquiesced in it. \u201cInequality is unlikely to fall much in the future unless our attitudes turn unequivocally against it. Among other things, we will need to accept that how much people earn in the market is often not what they deserve, and that the tax they pay is not taking from what is rightfully theirs.\u201d Sport English football lurched back to the bad old days on Wednesday night when hundreds of supporters were baton-charged by riot police after hurling bottles and goading officers at a fan zone in Porto. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s two late goals, added to a first-half effort, gave Portugal a 3-1 win in the Nations League semi-final after Switzerland. Eden Hazard is set to join Real Madrid after the Spanish club and Chelsea agreed a fee in the region of \u20ac100m (\u00a388.5m) plus add-ons. Rohit Sharma\u2019s patient century guided India to a six-wicket victory to leave South Africa staring at a Cricket World Cup exit after their third defeat in three games. And Johanna Konta, the British No 1, can reach her first grand slam final with victory in Paris on Friday but even if she fails she is enjoying her tennis again and believes that is the reason for her resurgence. Business Japan\u2019s Nikkei has eked out some small gains overnight as Asian markets were hampered by concerns about the US trade rows with Mexico and China, prompting investors to buy domestic-demand oriented shares. Mexican and American officials claimed progress in White House talks late on Wednesday but Donald Trump declared it was \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d to halt the import taxes he wants to impose if the flow of migrants to America\u2019s southern border is not addressed. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, has told Reuters that escalating tariff threats are sapping business and market confidence, and could slow growth that is currently expected to improve next year. The pound is worth $1.268 and \u20ac1.129 this morning while the FTSE is due to open a bit higher. The papers D-day commemorations feature on many of the front pages today. The Mirror says \u201cOn behalf of the free world... thank you\u201d, the Mail says we have \u201cA debt we can never repay\u201d, the Telegraph praises \u201cThe resilient generation\u201d, the Times calls the commemorations \u201cA salute to sacrifice\u201d, the Express urges the country: \u201cLet us never forget their sacrifice\u201d and the Sun leads on the Queen\u2019s speech on the anniversary: \u201cMaj generation\u201d. The i and the Guardian have pictures from the commemorations but splash on different stories. The i\u2019s lead is \u201cSave our NHS\u201d, saying the country needs to resist any attempts to sell off the health service to the US, and the Guardian\u2019s is: \u201cSocial services accused of failing toddlers murdered in their homes\u201d. The FT also has a picture of commemorations, featuring the Queen, Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron. Its top story is: \u201cWoodford fund crisis deepens as St James\u2019s Place cuts $3.5bn ties\u201d.
