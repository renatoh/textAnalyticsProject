A fifth-minute goal from Ben Chorley earned a 1-0 win at Wigan so, mathematically, the Dons face one more week of uncertainty. Not their manager Stuart Murdoch, however. He said: \"We will get relegated, we know that, but we do hope to start next season with a flourish.\" Above them Bradford lost 1-0 at Preston and Derby failed by a similar margin at home to Walsall. Lee Bradbury's controversial late penalty was a relief for his manager Colin Lee. Bradbury got up to score after the referee overruled his assistant and penalised Michael Johnson for a foul on Bradbury. Johnson was also then sent off. Lee said: \"I would be a bit upset if I were in their camp. On the other hand, we've had enough decisions given against us.\" Gillingham, Burnley and Watford are all two points to the safe side of Derby. A last-minute penalty miss by Alan Pouton meant Gillingham lost 2-1 at home to Cardiff, for whom Robert Earnshaw also missed a penalty but made amends with the game's opening goal. In the Second Division Port Vale slipped out of the promotion play-off places after losing 2-1 away to relegation-bound Wycombe Wanderers, for whom Darren Currie scored both goals, one from a penalty. Torquay missed a chance to edge Huddersfield out of the top three in the Third Division when they were held 2-2 at home by Yeovil ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
