Power travelled six miles to the camp most days through winter, with the help of her walking stick, to help set up blockades, provide food and counselling, and raise awareness. Her commitment is driven by anger, particularly at the police. \"They beat people up, and are very invasive when they deal with women. I didn't understand why the younger generation hate them so much until I was on the frontline.\" Assisting lock-ons (protesters who chain themselves to dangerous machinery to impede their operation) has put Power at physical risk. She has also been instrumental in the legal overturning of arrests made at the site. \"I stand as witness in court looking like a respectable citizen, which helps the judge decide they're not dealing with morons, layabouts and hippies, but clever, dedicated people, giving up their lives to a cause.\" At the age of 82, wouldn't she rather be at home with a cup of tea and Corrie? \"I don't drink tea and can't bear Coronation Street!\" she laughs. Besides which, she's still got energy to burn. \"I've got 4,000 emails to deal with every day, plus Facebook. It's about hearing where the next danger point is, deciding a good strategy. Someone this morning said why don't we cover ourselves in lard and run naked? They'll have a job to catch us! That was a funny one.\" Runners-up: Barton Moss Community Protection camp, Georgina Downs, John Herbert, Pushpanath Krishnamurthy"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
