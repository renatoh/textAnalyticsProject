The Anfield club have made a \u00a310m offer for the 20-year-old forward and although that is around \u00a33.5m below Ajax's valuation, Babel is expected to complete the move within days. Arsenal had been monitoring his progress but Liverpool are likely to use some of the money from Craig Bellamy's expected \u00a37.5m move to West Ham. Babel was a member of the Holland squad for the 2006 World Cup and was also a key man in the Under-21 team which won the recent European Championship. Ben\u00edtez invested a club-record \u00a326.5m to sign Fernando Torres from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last week and he is also still interested in West Ham's Yossi Benayoun. Liverpool's Jamie Carragher rang a radio station last night after a presenter had called him a \"bottler\" after it emerged that the defender wants to retire from international football because he is tired of being \"a bit-part player\" and has fallen behind younger contenders such as Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate, as well as the first-choice picks John Terry and Rio Ferdinand. \"Don't ever call me a bottler on radio,\" Carragher told Talksport's Adrian Durham. \"It would be interesting to see if you've got any bottle if you come down here and say it to me at Anfield or Melwood on a Champions League night. \"Steve McClaren played Ledley King [in the Euro qualifier against Estonia in June], who's a top player but he's been injured all season. How would you feel? They are all younger than me and if I'm not getting a game at 29 then I've got no chance at 32.\" Carragher is due to meet the England head coach before next month's friendly with Germany, with McClaren determined to convince the central defender that he is closer to a place than he imagines. \"I'm not doing this to leave England in the lurch,\" Carragher added. \"If it's an absolute emergency and by that I mean all available centre-halves are out injured or there are suspensions, I probably won't say no if I'm asked. Playing the odd game for England isn't enough for me any more. This could extend my top-level club career by at least two years.\" Djibril Ciss\u00e9 has signed a five-year deal with Marseille. The 25-year-old forward, who cost Liverpool a then club-record \u00a314m when he arrived in 2004, spent last season on loan with the French club. Diomansy Kamara has completed a \u00a36m move from West Bromwich Albion to Fulham, signing a four-year deal. The Hawthorns club have also accepted a \u00a35.3m bid from Wigan for Jason Koumas. \"We have said all along we will only consider selling players if we receive head-turning offers,\" said the chairman, Jeremy Peace. \"These offers mirror those criteria.\" Preston's striker David Nugent, 22, missed training yesterday to hold more talks with Portsmouth. Derby's manager, Billy Davies, has finally recruited David Kelly, his former assistant at Preston."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
