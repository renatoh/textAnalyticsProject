M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other organisations have shown that not only can treatment be provided, but it can be done with great success. Since then that same international community has endorsed a target of universal access to treatment by 2010. Significant progress has been made but, today, on World Aids Day 2006, we are still very far from that goal. The latest UN/Aids report shows that more people are dying and more are becoming infected than ever before. Less than a quarter of the 6.5 million people who urgently require antiretroviral treatment (ART) receive it. MSF first started treating patients with ART in 2000. We now provide medical care and ART to 80,000 people in over 30 countries. Success and failures have brought lessons along the way. After six years of providing treatment, there can be no doubt that it works. The challenges of universal access are numerous and cannot be met by MSF alone. From the outset of our work in this field, it was clear that the traditional model of doctors providing HIV/Aids care in central hospitals would not work if we wanted to have any impact on the huge numbers of people living with the disease in rural Africa. It is not good enough to provide treatment only in large hospitals and hope that sick people will be able to access them despite the hours of walking or high costs of travel. In all its projects, MSF is trying to decentralise HIV/Aids care, move it away from hospitals in cities that many people cannot get to and into local health clinics in small communities. It is no easy task. The problems of working in remote areas where health facilities are, at best, basic are exacerbated by the crippling shortage of trained medical staff. In 2002, when MSF started its HIV/Aids programme in the eastern Cape province of South Africa, only 40% of nursing posts were filled and the antenatal clinics had not seen a doctor for more than five years. As nurses incorporated HIV/Aids treatment into their consultations, patient numbers increased from 16,000 seen per month in 2003 to 29,000 in 2006. As only 50% of nursing posts were filled, the workload grew from 29 patients per nurse per day in 2004 to 47 per nurse per day this year. Despite the stigma and discrimination that surrounds this disease, MSF's work in Lusikisiki shows that if treatment is available people will access it. Yet the challenge is how to provide effective and sustainable treatment in countries where there are very few medically trained staff and many of those who are trained leave to seek better paid work elsewhere. One way that MSF is trying to overcome this challenge is to \"de-medicalise\" HIV/Aids care as much as possible by training and supporting members of the community to do some of the work normally done by doctors or nurses. Community involvement is crucial to the success of MSF's HIV/Aids care. In Lusikisiki, when trained counsellors replaced nurses to perform counselling and testing for HIV there was a sharp increase in the number of tests done every month. All our projects employ peer health educators, people who themselves have HIV, to help patients cope with the burden of having this chronic disease. Adherence counsellors educate and follow patients to make sure they take their treatment properly. Volunteers visit patients in their homes to provide much-needed emotional support. However, decentralised care and increased community involvement at a local level will be meaningless unless it is met with political action both at a national and international level. Innovative approaches to simplify and decentralise must continue to be tried and, where successful, scaled up. More effort must be made to ensure that sufficient staff are trained and properly paid. And, most importantly, treatment must be provided free of charge. Research by MSF in Lagos, Nigeria, has shown that, when patients had to pay for their own care, 44% either did not take their antiretroviral drugs every day or took insufficient dosages due to lack of funds. In January of this year, the Nigerian government made ART free of charge, but many patients still have to pay for other medical services, such as blood tests or treatment for opportunistic infections. These fees and charges prevent many people from getting the care they need because they simply cannot afford to pay them. Last year, on World Aids Day, the Guardian launched its Christmas appeal in support of MSF's HIV/Aids work in sub-Saharan Africa. The appeal was unique in that it asked readers not for a one-off donation, but for a long-term commitment to help MSF and its partners to care for and treat people infected with this disease. The response was phenomenal: over \u00a3642,000 raised in 2006 and an estimated \u00a31.5m supporting MSF's HIV/Aids work over a five-year period. We thank you all for your support and ask you to stay involved in ensuring that the international commitment to providing care to all those affected by HIV/Aids is not allowed to fail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
