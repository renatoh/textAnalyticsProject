Jewell, who left Bradford for a doomed stint at Sheffield Wednesday last season, was unveiled as Wigan's third manager in just over two months today. Bruce Rioch, who started last season in charge at the JJB stadium was sacked at the end of February and his assistant Colin Greenall took over until the beginning of April when Steve Bruce was handed the job. However Bruce walked out on the club to take over at Crystal Palace after the Latics failed to win promotion through the play-offs for a third successive year. Dave Whelan, Wigan's chairman, only approached Jewell about the post on Friday but was impressed enough to install him as manager within 72 hours. Jewell, who scored 35 goals in 117 league games for the club in the early 80s, said he was looking forward to teaming up with Hutchings again, describing him as a \"successful coach\". He said: \"It is a forward-thinking club with an ambitious chairman, like myself. \"Although I am not in the business of making rash predictions, we will be looking to get out of this division and we will be pulling out all the stops to do so.\" Jewell added that he had enjoyed his three months out of the game since his sacking from Sheffield Wednesday in February but said that he had started to get \"itchy feet\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
