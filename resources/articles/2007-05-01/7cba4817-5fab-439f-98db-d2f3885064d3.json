Fraser Waters, the Wasps' centre whose career since the club won the 2004 Premiership title has been blighted by injury, was named the man-of-the-match for the way he organised Wasps' aggressive, unyielding defence, reducing a side which had gone into the match seeking an unprecedented season's treble and billed as one of the strongest in England for several years to a rabble without a cause. Once Leicester's power game was defused, and with the Tigers lacking options on the bench having omitted their one genuinely quick back, Tom Varndell, they had no tactical alternative. The threat of Tuilagi and Rabeni was blunted by tackles around the ankles before either wing could break into a trot let alone a gallop, but as crucial was Wasps' overwhelming superiority at the breakdown which forced Leicester to largely play behind the gainline and without any momentum. Whereas Leicester had dominated the tackle area against Gloucester, allowing Tuilagi and Rabeni to charge at a back-pedalling defence, Wasps, with their marauding back row supported by the prop Tom French, stopped ball-carriers dead and forced more turnovers than Leicester had probably conceded all year. Their victory was down not just to the two tries from improvised line-outs schemed up by the coach Leon Holden but crucial tackles which turned defence into attack. Tuilagi, like the previous week, had to wait five minutes to get his hands on the ball and he immediately charged past Waters, but that marked the afternoon's high spot for the Samoan, who by the second-half stopped coming into the midfield having conceded two penalties in 11 minutes after being tackled which Alex King converted to give Wasps a 10-point lead. Typical of the way Wasps dealt with Tuilagi was when the wing was put into space by Dan Hipkiss on 36 minutes but, before he could start pumping his legs, Rapha\u00ebl Iba\u00f1ez and Paul Sackey hit him head on with Joe Worsley then wrestling him to the ground to leave him thumping the ground in frustration. \"I was surprised to be named man-of-the-match but I guess it was a victory forged on our defence,\" said the 31-year old Waters. \"It was a day when you could not single out anyone in our side because it was the complete team performance. Defensively, it was up there with our best during my time here and it had to be. We knew the threat Leicester posed but we also appreciated our own strengths. I stuck my shoulder into Tuilagi early on and lost feeling in it for a while. You have to tackle him low and it helps when you force Leicester to play behind the gainline.\" Leicester trailed by 13 points with 15 minutes to go and exerted themselves for a final onslaught, only to be undone by two Waters tackles. First Tuilagi, 10 yards from the line, appeared to have broken the centre's challenge, only to be hauled down by his right ankle at the moment he anticipated bringing his side back into the game before, from even closer range, Martin Corry slipped past Daniel Leo, only to be turned over by Waters a couple of yards out. \"I had a frustrating couple of years after picking up an ankle injury which was expected to heal within six weeks,\" said Waters. \"I am still not where I want to be and I aim to be quicker next season. It was an incredibly fast game to play in and I was blowing through my backside by the end, but you forget about being tired when you win European club rugby's top prize.\" Wasps have won at least one trophy in each of the last five seasons and yesterday was a triumph not just for their written-off players but their coaching staff, led by the director of rugby Ian McGeechan. \"We knew the threat Leicester posed,\" he said. \"Fraser is very astute defensively and reads the play extremely well. We put them on the back foot and that makes it difficult for even the strongest runners.\" As the legend on a cider wagon read as it rolled out of the ground last night, Wasps are at their most dangerous this time of year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
