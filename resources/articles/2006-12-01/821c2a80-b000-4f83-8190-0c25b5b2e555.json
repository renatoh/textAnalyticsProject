Warner Bros is in negotiations with the inspirational Mexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro, the director of Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth, to direct a new version of the character. He says he believes there is new ground to cover by going back to the original words of Edgar Rice Burroughs. \"I'd love to create a new version that is still a family movie, but as edgy as I can make it.There are strong themes of survival of a defenceless child left behind in the most hostile environment.\" So who could be Tarzan? Johnny Weissmuller is still Tarzan in many people's eyes, which is why this column will start the process by pitching to del Toro the Thorpedo himself, the recently retired swimmer Ian Thorpe - he of the size 17 feet. Del Toro is also among the nominations, published yesterday, for best director at the London Film Critics' Circle awards. He is up against Paul Greengrass (United 93), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Children of Men), Martin Scorsese (The Departed) and Pedro Almod\u00f3var (Volver). Needless to say, Helen Mirren is nominated as best actress - up against Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Meryl Streep and Joan Allen - while the best actor will be chosen from Forest Whitaker, David Strathairn, Richard Griffiths, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeff Daniels. Leslie Phillips will get an outstanding contribution to cinema award at the ceremony on February 8 and the best film will be chosen from The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine, Volver, United 93 and The Queen. Normally this column is all in favour of celebrities and artists washing their dirty linen on the internet - if they do it in a snappy and succinct way. That claim cannot be made for Axl Rose, pictured, who has published a 1,000-word letter on his website explaining why the new Guns N' Roses album is so delayed. The poor man, it all sounds terrible. Rose writes: \"Overcoming the endless and seemingly insane amount of obstacles faced by all involved, notwithstanding the emotional challenges endured by everyone has at many times seemed like a bad dream in which one wakes up only to find that they are still in the nightmare.\" His newly sacked manager, Merck Mercuriadis, has written a long reply blaming Rose's frequently absent muse. We are getting an increasingly good picture of who will not be playing at Glastonbury next year. Last month it was confirmed Bruce Springsteen was never going to play the festival and yesterday organiser Emily Eavis broke many hearts when she confirmed Kylie Minogue would not be performing. She told BBC 6 Music: \"It's not going to happen.\" She also said the Killers and Muse would not be there. \"We've got really good stuff coming in. But there's not going to be dominating headliners.\" mark.brown@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
