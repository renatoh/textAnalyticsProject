The total \u00a33.6bn earnings of Premier League clubs in 2015-16, as reported by the Guardian\u2019s own review of the clubs\u2019 most recently published accounts are projected to have increased to \u00a34.5bn last season, the first of the league\u2019s vastly more lucrative 2016-19 TV deals. The size of domestic and international TV rights sales, \u00a32.8bn per season, \u00a38.4bn in total over three years, is approximately double that of the Bundesliga\u2019s own improved deals, which are expected to pay around \u20ac1.4bn annually to the clubs in Germany\u2019s top two divisions. Although England\u2019s clubs will not publish their 2016-17 accounts for several months yet, the Premier League has already disclosed its distribution of TV and sponsorship money last season, which Deloitte calculates was 45% higher than in 2015-16. The size of that increase, and the gaping financial superiority over the other leagues, is reflected in Premier League clubs\u2019 transfer activity so far this summer, accounting for the majority of the biggest money signings and the continuing attraction of players and managers from other European leagues. Chelsea, last season\u2019s champions, were paid \u00a3151m from the Premier League\u2019s TV and sponsorship distribution; Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United all earned more than \u00a3140m, while Sunderland, who finished bottom, nevertheless received \u00a393m. Those earnings, by far a record for any domestic league\u2019s TV deals, included the clubs\u2019 share of \u00a3782m the Premier League secured per season from sales of TV rights overseas, which is distributed equally, \u00a339.09m to each of the 20 clubs. The gap between Premier League clubs\u2019 earnings and those in Europe\u2019s next wealthiest leagues would be even greater were it not for the fall in the value of the pound against the euro following the British vote to leave the European Union last June. Deloitte projects England\u2019s top 20 clubs will make \u20ac5.1bn in the forthcoming 2017-18 season, Bundesliga clubs \u20ac3.2bn, Spanish La Liga clubs \u20ac3bn, with less than \u20ac2bn forecast to be earned by the clubs in each of the French and Italian top divisions. The gap created by the Premier League is widening in England too, its \u00a32.4bn annual TV deal is almost 30 times greater than that of the EFL, which is reported to be currently \u00a390m across all three divisions. Deloitte\u2019s review of Championship clubs\u2019 financial accounts in 2015-16 shows that clubs paid more in wages than all the income they earned, and sustained heavy losses, mostly funded with \u00a3761m loans from owners, as they chase the jackpot of promotion. The 24 Championship clubs made \u00a3556m in total, over half of which came from parachute payments for relegated clubs, but paid \u00a3561m in wages, and had record total operating losses of \u00a3261m. vast bonanza to clubs promoted for the first time across English football\u2019s great financial divide, with Huddersfield Town and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion set to receive a minimum \u00a3170m increase over the next three years, even if they are relegated after only one year. The Premier League has said that it currently distributes approximately \u00a3100m to the 72 Football League clubs, principally in the Championship, as \u201csolidarity\u201d payments, and further funds for player pensions and youth development. In May, the Premier League said it also spends a further \u00a3100m on grass roots facilities and projects via the Football Foundation and club community programmes, which is approximately 3.6% of the Premier League\u2019s annual TV income."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
