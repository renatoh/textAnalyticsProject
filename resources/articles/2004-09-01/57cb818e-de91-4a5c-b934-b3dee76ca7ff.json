Members of his family issue desperate pleas for his safety and release. Special church services and prayer meetings are held on his behalf. Petitions are dispatched to London urging the powerful to \"do something\" to free him. In sections of the media there are dark mutterings about the clash of civilisations. No: this is not to do with poor Kenneth Bigley and his terrifying and terrible ordeal. I am writing about those Britons who were held captive in North Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries; but I could equally well have been referring to British captives in other continents and at other times. As far as these small islands are concerned, recurrent crises over hostages and captives is part of the price we have paid over the centuries for intruding so busily and often very violently into other people's lands. In the early modern era, British commercial interests in the Mediterranean and colonial incursions into Tangier, Gibraltar and Minorca made us more vulnerable to the so-called Barbary corsairs. These were privateers, operating out of Morocco and other North African polities, who attacked Christian merchant and fishing vessels at sea, and took those on board captive. At least 20,000 Britons suffered this fate between 1600 and 1730. Some of these victims were enslaved in North Africa for years, or for ever. Others (just like Muslims captured by Christian corsairs) were forced to row in galleys - effectively a death sentence. Those men and women who left Britain to settle in North America were also vulnerable to capture, sometimes by rival European colonisers, but mainly by Native Americans. The latter seized at least 3,000 British settlers in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia in the late 1750s alone. Many of these captives were ordinary folk, farmers, labourers, women, and children. The luckier ones were often absorbed into the tribes of their captors; but male captives were sometimes tortured to death. Naturally, in the years before the Raj was securely established, there were also many British captives in India. In 1780, perhaps one-in-five British-born soldiers in India were being held in captivity, most of them in the powerful southern Indian state of Mysore. Some of these men were killed by their captors. Others died of malnutrition, or wounds, or despair. But, again, it was not only those in uniform who suffered. One of EM Forster's little-known works is an edition of the autobiography of Elizabeth Fay, a very ordinary Englishwoman who was reduced to utter terror when she was briefly held captive in Mysore. These kinds of imperial captivities, whether of soldiers or civilians, also occurred in the 19th century. Some of the most famous happened when the British invaded Afghanistan in 1838. They did so not to colonise the region, but to enforce regime-change in Kabul. Initially, things went smoothly. Then, as tends to happen in Afghanistan, it got rough. Over 12,000 British and Indian troops perished in this Afghan war. Others were sold into slavery. And well over 100 British men, women and children were held captive for several months. As with other captivity crises - as now - the fate of the individuals caught up in these overseas traumas aroused deep emotion and anger back in Britain. The captives in Afghanistan, wrote one London journalist in 1843, had: \"excited more interest in the mother country than all the other events of the war\"; \"The history of the world,\" claimed another, \"barely contains scenes of more terrific interest.\" Songs, circus-acts, speeches and plays were devoted to them. Bestsellers were published about them. The letters the captives sent home were read out in parliament and pored over by Queen Victoria herself. And this kind of excitement was generated by subsequent captivity crises too. For, as the extent of the empire widened, so did the locations of British captivities: men, women and children from these islands were held in Australia at the hands of Aborigines, in parts of Latin America, in Egypt, in South Africa, and in India again during the so-called \"Mutiny\". So why are these dramatic and pitiful episodes so often forgotten now? Why isn't Mr Bigley's ordeal viewed in a much longer, broader context? The answer lies in the way that Britain's past global experiences are generally represented and written about. W hen the British empire was still in existence, the more embarrassing and painful aspects of these captivity episodes were often airbrushed out of the official story. Members of the master race were not to be seen as suffering in such a disadvantaged fashion. Professional historians of the British empire now tend to focus on its elites - the generals, explorers, proconsuls, administrators, capitalists, financiers and intellectuals - not the sort of people who always formed the bulk of captives: common soldiers, sailors, small traders, mere womenfolk and the like. Likewise, postcolonial writers on British activities overseas often leave these bedraggled people out. They argue that it is the indigenous peoples of America, India, Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere - those at the receiving end of Britishimperial aggression - whose sufferings and struggles should be remembered, not those stray Brits who got caught and caught out in large numbers on every continent. This is an understandable reaction, but a mistaken one. For while colonisation as Europeans practised it has largely ceased to be a factor in our global experience today, varieties and versions of empire are still very much with us - and are likely to be so in the foreseeable future. It is, therefore, imperative that we remind ourselves of what empire has really been like over the centuries for all of those involved in it. For some of its exponents, to be sure, overseas empire meant power, prestige and substantial profits. But as Stephen M Walt has written: \"It is extremely difficult to project power across water and on to a foreign shore.\" Empire in the past was always a far harsher and much more accident-prone business than conventional history books imply. And the costs of these overseas invasions were borne not just by those on the receiving end but - frequently - by ordinary, vulnerable people among or associated with the invaders. There is a final point. In the past, whether Britons were being held captive in Africa, India, North America or Australia, their countrymen and relations at least knew who they should petition to help in their release. The authorities might - or might not - be able to expedite the hostages' release, but at least these authorities were in London. Now Britain is once again engaging in overseas adventure, but this time as a subordinate ally to another, far greater power. Whatever one thinks of this, our long history of overseas captivities has clearly entered a very different and more problematic phase. \u00b7 Linda Colley's Captives: Britain, Empire and the World 1600-1850 is published by Pimlico"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
