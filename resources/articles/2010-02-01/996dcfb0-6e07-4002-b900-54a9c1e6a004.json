Middle-aged dads shaped to throw their burgers at anyone who tried it on. Blood trickled from the odd impact point where a haymaker had been thrown. Police dogs yapped. Then a game broke out between neighbours who have had near-death experiences. Fans United, this was not. There were no shared sob stories, no email addresses exchanged and no pledge to fight mismanagement together under the county banner. Southampton would not throw a thimble of water on Portsmouth if they were on fire. The feeling is mutual. Pompey now have until 1 March to save themselves. There will be no whip-round at St Mary's. Fuelled by testosterone, the contest of England's south coast brought together one club who hit rock bottom and bounced, and another who won the FA Cup two years ago but were almost locked up and shut down this week at the High Court. England's only World Cup referee, Howard Webb, was sent south to keep order on the pitch. Saints v Survivors. The League One club were loaded, the Premier League mob motored west potless. Southampton's followers waved wads of banknotes at enemies more used to watching their side face Manchester United and Chelsea. Football's finances, football's governance, are off their axes. Yet both clubs could draw hope from this sulphurous encounter. Portsmouth, because their players are still trying despite having countless reasons not to, and Southampton because there are fine young players in Alan Pardew's rebuilt side. If there is a better midfielder in League One than Adam Lallana could he please make himself known at reception. Lallana carries the ball beautifully. Morgan Schneiderlin is another player born for a higher level. A pity Papa Waigo N'Diaye, the Saints striker, was so nerve-ravaged in front of goal in the first half. Joyful was the day for Pompey's followers when they thought they wouldn't see those detested red and white stripes again for a generation. While Lassana Diarra, Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch and Glen Johnson were strutting about in Portsmouth blue, the Saints, with their swanky arena and posh directors, were losing their religion, plunging, via administration, to the third tier, where the investment of Swiss billionaire Markus Liebherr is now paying dividends. \"What division are you in?\" sang the Pompey choir. \"The same one as you \u2013 soon,\" the home crowd might have retaliated. Students of derbies keep a facial contortion scale to register tribal animosity. Rangers-Celtic breaks the dial, Barcelona-Real Madrid hits the red zone and Manchester United-Liverpool is almost unrecordable. But be assured: this little dockyard tussle is no tea dance either. Even in the most expensive seats, people dressed for a day's work at a bank spewed invective at the \"skates\" from along the shore. Needless to say the game went largely unwatched by these demented souls. Rickie Lambert's equaliser sent them into the raptures but further Pompey goals by Aruna Dindane, Nadir Belhadj and finally Jamie O'Hara passed them by. They were too busy outing an undercover Portsmouth fan in their section. If the poor chap had been a witch spotted by puritans on the Mayflower he would have been treated more kindly. For Southampton, an FA Cup fifth-round tie served up a chance to see how fast this new side might travel on the road back to the Premier League. Liebherr is no twinkly philanthropist who saw a chance to randomly help a Hampshire town. Rather, he spotted a bargain buy. And he is, according to Pardew, \"on hurry-up time\" to escape League One. If Saints pass Pompey on the escalator, Liebherr might even start revealing more of himself. Either way, with each day his punt makes more financial sense. First principle of buying an endangered club: pick one with a new stadium that has a 30,000-plus capacity. Portsmouth, on the other hand, inhabit an atmospheric museum, of little appeal to the next Liebherr, assuming one even exists. To pay off Pompey's debts \u2013 even with an advanced parachute payment from a Premier League eager to be shot of them \u2013 a new owner would need to torch tens of millions of pounds for no physical return. Pompey have a strong community spirit but that tends not to show on a balance sheet. At least this trip into enemy terrain brought their supporters even closer together. When clubs are imperilled by reckless (or sinister) ownership we see the love of fans form a protective cordon around what's left of the institution. In the first half the Pompey players appeared sick to death of it all. In the second they cut Southampton to ribbons with their pace. So the completely skint Premier League club hammered the rich League One team. If you were looking for logic, or love, you were in the wrong place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
