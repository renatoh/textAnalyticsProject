It's an eclectic mix of the dreamlike and the didactic, including rare 1925 silent Prem Sanyas, on the life of the Buddha himself (pictured), with live sitar and tabla accompaniment, Hometown Of The Heart, one of only two Korean films to have survived the war, and The Devotion Of Matthieu Ricard, a charming documentary about a monk described as \"the happiest man alive\". Also screening are rather more familiar films on a Buddhist tip, like Donnie Darko and Dead Man, which epitomise the concept of the bardo, the gap between one life and the next; a genre-defying genre if ever there was one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
