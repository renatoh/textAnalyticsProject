Watson, who finished on a disappointing 13 over par, would only say \"Next year is next year\" and \"Who can say?\" when asked if he would be appearing in his 27th Open at Royal St Georges. His 77 and 78 were \"pretty poor scores,\" he said as he walked off the 18th green. \"It was pretty benign out there but the pin positions are very difficult, which is why there have not been that many low scores.\" As for his own game, he said: \"I think I need to go back to the drawing board a little bit.\" His frustration was compounded by losing a ball on the final hole after hitting his drive into the left-hand rough at the one spot where there were no spectators to mark where it landed. After searching for the allotted five minutes he had the indignity of returning to the tee and hitting another. A kindly rules official had the decency to give the 52-year-old a lift back down the fairway, but if this does turn out to be his final Open it is not the way he will want or deserve to bow out. But Watson was not the only big name to find Muirfield's clinging rough too tough to handle. Vijay Singh, the former Masters and US PGA champion, was heading home last night after finishing five over par. Birdies at the 17th and 18th were not enough to repair the damage he had inflicted on his round, having bogeyed three of the first five holes. John Daly, the big-hitting, hard-living Californian who won the championship in 1985 at St Andrews, was also on his way out after being seven over at the turn yesterday. The former Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal could safely pack away his clubs as well after carding a disappointing three-over-par 145. \"I am very sad,\" he said. \"My parents are still here and it is a pity they cannot see me in the last round of the Open.\" His playing partner Tom Whitehouse, 22, who made it through regional and final qualifying before gaining a place in the tournament proper when the American Kenny Perry pulled out, finished on four over par for the tournament after a fantastic par round yesterday. \"I was a bit nervous on Thursday but today I just got really into it and played for myself rather than playing for them,\" he said. \"It is a bit disappointing that I'm not going to be around for the weekend, but I've got so much out of the week. I guess the main thing is I realised these guys are human.\" Other notable names who will not be around for the weekend include Michael Campbell, the much fancied New Zealander, and US Ryder Cup players Scott Hoch and Hal Sutton. Lee Westwood, one of the European team's mainstays, was also packing his bags, after finishing three over. All three amateurs missed the cut, meaning there will be no winner of the coveted silver medal this year. Alejandro Larrazabal, winner of the Amateur Championship at Royal Porthcawl in June, finished with a 10-over-par 152 for the two rounds. Simon Young, 23, from Whitehaven, who made his way through the lottery of final qualifying despite having hardly picked up a club in the last two months after his wife suffered a brain haemorrhage, was nine over par at the turn. Two players billed as the future stars of English golf, Luke Donald and Paul Casey, failed to live up to expectations. Donald, 24, who made his name on the US college tour, finished at five over par, while Casey was seven over after 12 holes. Roger Chapman, doomed anyway, made doubly sure he was not going to be around for the weekend when he signed for the wrong score at the 7th hole and was immediately disqualified."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
