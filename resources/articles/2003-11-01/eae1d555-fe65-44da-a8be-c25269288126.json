Senior non-executive Lord St John of Fawsley has already been targeted publicly by the National Association of Pension Funds but others closer to Rupert Murdoch are now also at risk, including one of his key lieutenants, Chase Carey, and the former News Corporation vice-president, David Evans. Mr Evans is listed as a non-executive and independent director but one shareholder MediaGuardian.co.uk spoke to tonight said he might have to go. Sources at one institutional investor say they are determined not to \"let go\" of the issue now that chairman Rupert Murdoch has succeeded in parachuting his son into the top job against their wishes. They are furious that they were not fully consulted by the company's nominations committee during the hunt for a new chief executive and want to deliver Rupert Murdoch a bloody nose at the meeting on November 14. \"Someone like that [30-year-old James] would not normally be appointed to a FTSE 100 company,\" said one investor. \"But mainly we're not happy with the non-executives, and may well be voting against them - all of them. \"It's quite tricky because Murdoch has 35% and the American investors tend not to do very much, but we can't just let it go.\" The investor said current plans involved opposing the election of James Murdoch as a non-executive as well as former cabinet secretary Lord Wilson of Dinton. Even independent non-executives have angered shareholders because they, rather than the News Corp-appointed directors, took the unanimous decision to appoint James Murdoch on Monday. The shareholder revolt comes as the NAPF also called for a boardroom shake-up to assuage investor anger. \"More board-level changes will be required to reassure non-News Corp shareholders,\" the NAPF said tonight. \"This should, as a minimum, involve the appointment of more independent non-executive directors and a thorough review of all corporate governance procedures at the company.\" However, the NAPF urged investors to follow an \"engagement process\" rather than block the appointment of James Murdoch to the board. Another investor tonight said shareholders were feeling \"an overriding sense of disappointment\" with the process the BSkyB board followed in looking for a replacement for the highly regarded Tony Ball. \"There was an opportunity to behave in a way appropriate for a company with 65% non-Murdoch interests and they did not avail themselves of that opportunity.\" The investor said some of the non-executive directors had been put in an \"impossible position\" after \"blasts of sound from the News Corp camp\". \"It's been fairly ruthless how they [News Corp] have advanced their position, cuts the legs off from the non-executives,\" the investor said. \"The chairman [Rupert Murdoch] wasn't very keen on the process in the first place and then sabotaged it with his perfect sense of timing and drops his old mate St John like a hot potato.\" Lord St John - a former Tory arts minister with links to Rupert Murdoch stretching back 12 years - has been targeted by the NAPF, which wants him voted off the board. BSkyB is hoping to win shareholders round and has embarked on a series of meetings to reassure them their concerns are being listened to. Today directors Allan Leighton and Gail Rebuck met the NAPF, while James Murdoch has been telephoning institutional investors before returning to Hong Kong to tie up loose ends at Star TV. Many investors feel BSkyB's efforts have come too little too late and are not satisfied that the appointment of Lord Rothschild as deputy chairman will act as a brake on the father-son axis at the company's helm. \"The mistake people might make is to assume the chairman would be reasonable,\" the investor added. \"His behaviour throughout has not been reasonable. \"The only way to respond to unreasonable behaviour is to vote as you think appropriate and hope the situation does not deteriorate.\" Shareholders know it will be hard to mobilise opposition as the equity is spread thinly across investors. The largest holding after that of News Corp is just 3.07%. Although a successful shareholder campaign voting BSkyB directors off the board would not reverse James Murdoch's appointment, it would cast a heavy cloud over him at the start of his tenure and might provoke a corporate governance shake-up. \"It's possible the chairman is relying on shareholders' apathy - but they have a partial remedy in their own hands,\" the investor said. \"Lots of them feel very upset about it but whether they will manage to fill in their proxy card that way is another matter.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
