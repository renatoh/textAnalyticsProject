There was one in particular, which I'd cut from the Sunday Times colour magazine, depicting the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, when US soldiers led by Lieutenant William Calley murdered hundreds of civilians: the photo showed a heap of bloody corpses lying in a ditch. The photos attracted odd looks from less political-minded peers and they didn't do much for my sex life. But though the piety and ghoulishness of having them there now embarrasses me, they weren't merely right-on, in the way a Che Guevara poster would have been. The display was an expression of astonishment that something like this could have happened in our time - out there in the killing fields, away from the sanctuary of the campus. We weren't witnesses, as the photographer had been, but this was history and we were living through it and no one must be allowed to forget. Nowadays, the photos that students use to decorate their walls tend to be relaxed and intimate: shots of families and friends, of gap-year trips to distant places (including south-east Asia), of picnics and parties and discos. It's not that war and terror have gone away, but the preference is for a more benign version of reality. More benign but equally legitimate, since the claim being made is not dissimilar: here are photos of the history I have lived through. Writers and artists have always veered between these contrasting versions of history. On the one hand, it is argued, history is about global events - war, conflict, famine, terrorism, mass movements of people around the planet - and to record history means being in the front line, at crisis point, bearing witness to violent change. On the other hand, there are those who see history as the slow march of time, with most of us largely untouched by political turmoil, since our lives consist of what human life has always consisted of: birth, work, procreation, friendship and play. One view values journalistic reportage, the other the eternal verities. One view is happening, the other un-happening. One is epitomised by the feverishness of Auden's \"Spain\" (\"Yesterday the classic lecture / On the origin of Mankind. But today the struggle\"), the other by the placidity of his \"Mus\u00e9e Des Beaux Arts\" (apocalyptic events happening while \"someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along\"); or by Thomas Hardy in a poem of 1915: \"Only thin smoke without flame / From the heaps of couch-grass; / Yet this will go onward the same / Though Dynasties pass.\" What's striking about In the Face of History, a new exhibition of 20th-century photographs at the Barbican, London, is the way it marshals images from both camps. The curators, Kate Bush and Mark Sladen, have cast their net far and wide: here are 22 photographers drawn from all parts of Europe, with the earliest images (Eugene Atget's) dating from the 1890s and the most recent (Wolfgang Tillmans') from 2005. Eastern Europe is unusually well represented and there's a mix of familiar and less well-known names. But however diverse the styles and traditions on display, the same essential dichotomy recurs. It's there in the contrasting approaches of the only two British photographers in the show, for instance: Chris Killip and Craigie Horsfield. Killip's images of child coal-pickers on the north-east coast have become emblematic of the Thatcher era and of the mining communities which were destroyed in the 1980s; Horsfield's bleakly beautiful images from Poland and east London look timeless in comparison - the people in them might be living anywhere in almost any age. The title of the show calls to mind the question: should images of history be urgent, polemical, in-your-face? Or is it better to sneak behind history's back and catch it unawares? There's no right answer, of course, and most photographers adopt different strategies at different points in their careers. If the Barbican show has a bias, it's towards photographers who are attached with an almost poetic intensity to a particular place or community. One theme repeatedly addressed is \"the balancing act between objectivity and subjectivity\" - that's to say, the conflicting demands of being a participant, personally affected by the people and events in front of your lens, while also acting as an observer, coldly absorbed in the process of making a record or creating art. The \"participant-observer\", a term from social anthropology, could apply to every one of the assembled photographers - either because they appear in their own shots (the late SI Witkiewicz's favourite form is the self-portrait), or because they use members of their own family (as Switzerland's Annelies Strba does, in much the same fashion as Sally Mann), or because their immersion in their subject matter goes deeper than any newspaper or magazine assignment would allow. Whether Brassa\u00ef ever actually patronised the brothels of Montmartre is irrelevant - the obsessive pleasure he took in the prostitutes who worked there shines through his photos of them. Much the same can be said of the Swedish photographer Christer Str\u00f6mholm, another outsider captivated by the Parisian demi-monde: even if he hadn't taken shots of himself with hookers and transsexuals from the neighbourhood of Place Blanche, his sense of them as \"friends\" would be apparent. \"If you do not participate in life, you don't get any good images,\" he said, which wasn't just an excuse for a louche lifestyle. Many of the photos Brassa\u00ef took remained secret for several decades, because he feared their publication would cause a scandal. So, for rather different reasons, did those of Henryk Ross, who took photographs of the L\u00f3dz ghetto. Ross, who was Jewish, lived and even married in the ghetto. But he also had status as an observer, being one of two official photographers employed by the department of statistics. Between 1940 and 1945 he took 6,000 photos, many of them distinctly unofficial since they captured scenes of death and brutality. Knowing that those negatives would cost him his life if discovered, he secretly buried them in barrels under the earth when the Germans began liquidating the ghetto in 1944 - and then recovered them when the Red Army arrived the following year. The images he published in the postwar years offered, as he put it, \"a historical record of our martyrdom\", and were used as evidence in the trial of Adolf Eichmann. The visual record Ross compiled was immensely powerful, but it was also partial. Only in 1997, after his death, were all his negatives made available, and many of those he had chosen not to publish challenge what we thought we knew about Nazi camps and ghettoes. Here are people looking happy, well dressed and well fed; here are couples kissing; here are trees, open spaces and greenery. It also emerged that Ross wasn't above modifying or retouching his negatives - in one case he added barbed wire to a shot of the \"Aryan\" street running through the L\u00f3dz ghetto, for dramatic effect. In a sense, Ross stands doubly accused: first, like the ghetto leader Chaim Rumkowski, for reaping the benefits of collaborating with the Germans during the war; second, once the war was over, for using his images as anti-Nazi propaganda and suppressing anything that didn't fit his interpretation of ghetto history. Either way, there's an attempt to discredit his claim to be presenting historical truth. With only the photos themselves to go on, it would be difficult for an outsider to weigh up the arguments. But there's an exceptionally informative and intelligent defence of Ross by the American historian Thomas Weber in Martin Parr and Timothy Prus's L\u00f3dz Ghetto Album, a collection of Ross's photographs. I also consulted a near-neighbour of mine, Helen Aronson, one of 750 people (out of 220,000) to survive the L\u00f3dz ghetto. When she first came across Ross's photographs in 2004, they were a revelation. Not only did she recognise several friends, she also realised (thanks to her daughter's prompting) that she appears in one of them, leaning on the shoulder of an accordionist as a group of survivors celebrate liberation in January 1945. Since she had brought no photos out of the ghetto when she left it at 17, she found Ross's images cathartic as well as moving. And since they accord with her own memories, she doesn't doubt their accuracy. For her, the fact that some Jews (including her family) led comparatively privileged lives within the ghetto isn't shaming or scandalous, but part of a deeper truth about the Holocaust and human behaviour. It's not as if she, her mother and brother had large food rations or expected to survive; volunteering to take care of a group of children, her father was deported and gassed in Chelmno in 1942. Nor is Ross's courage diminished, or his record invalidated, because he worked for the Germans: as Weber puts it, \"Resistance and collaboration were not mutually exclusive concepts.\" Besides, the seeming innocence of the photos that Ross declined to publish is illusory. There's one of children playing a game, for instance, with a small boy in uniform pursuing half a dozen friends. The cheery mood defies the conventional narrative: how could anyone be happy in the L\u00f3dz ghetto? Look closely, though, and you see that the boy in uniform is playing at being a ghetto policeman and that the other children are being rounded up, as if for deportation. The ostensible subject of the photo is child's play, but the sinister adult context counteracts it. Even if all of Ross's photos had been of well-fed, smiling faces, he could hardly be blamed: psychologically, it would have made sense for him to take refuge in a denial of reality. In the face of history, it's natural to want to close one's eyes, run away or discover a less gloomy vista. There's a glorious photograph from 1969 by the Dutch-born Ed van der Elsken that shows a woman lying on a bed next to a vast picture-window; the camera is positioned behind her, so the viewer can see what she is looking out on - wooded valleys, powdery clouds and snow-capped Swiss mountains. The photo is faintly erotic (she's wearing only knickers) but also surreal: her left leg is encased in plaster to the top of her thigh. The right leg, we assume, is still intact, but since we can't see it we can't be sure. The image invites us to find a story in it. Perhaps the woman is convalescing in hospital, whether as the casualty of a car accident or a war - whichever, she has withdrawn from the modern world in order to gaze upon the sublime. \"In the mountains, there you feel free,\" Eliot writes in The Waste Land, and though this woman's freedom is restricted because of her broken leg, there's a suggestion that she's in flight from the modern world, since (Eliot again) \"human kind cannot bear very much reality\". It's no coincidence that a large number of photographs of children figure in the Barbican show. When history is at its most oppressive, children provide the most poignant images - and yet often seem the most resilient. The Dutch photographer Emmy Andriesse offers a powerful image of two children sitting on a wall during the \"hunger winter\" in Amsterdam in 1944-45: all we see is two pairs of legs, from the knee down, but the condition of the four shoes (battered and laceless), and the gallows overtones of the dangling legs, say more than any face could. By contrast, there's Sune Jonsson's 1956 photo of 11 Swedish schoolboys in a sauna, few of them smiling but all of them shiny and healthy, as few children in Europe would have been 10 years before. The Barbican show is as notable for what it omits as what it includes: there are no photos of the first world war trenches here, nothing from the General Strike or the Spanish civil war or the Prague Spring or 1990s Bosnia. The last section is called \"The End of History\", after Francis Fukuyama, but history seems to have ended even before we get there, with a new emphasis on photos of rural continuity or domestic routine. And yet Wolfgang Tillmans' photos of the so-called Berlin Market in 1989 - small, desperate heaps of shoddy goods - say more about economic migrants and the end of the cold war than most books could. And though Robert Doisneau's stunning photo of a group of men and women running and holding hands outside a French suburban block of flats is titled Josette's 20th Birthday and dates from 1947, no photo better captures the spirit of liberated Europe in 1945. That's history, as far as the poet and the photographer are concerned: not a date but an image; not a textbook debate but a human face; not even a document but an emotional and intellectual complex in an instant of time. \u00b7 In the Face of History: European Photographers in the 20th Century is at the Barbican, London EC2, until January 28.
