Sterling opened the scoring for Liverpool in their 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday, a result that takes them to within four points of Manchester City in the race for Champions League qualification, but the 20-year-old\u2019s contribution was overshadowed by the latest revelations regarding his private life. The England international was pictured smoking a shisha pipe in a Sunday newspaper and images have now emerged of him appearing to pass out having allegedly taken the legal substance otherwise known as laughing gas. Rodgers will speak to Sterling privately before deciding what action to take with a player who is in dispute with Liverpool over a new contract. But the Liverpool manager admitted it was not the behaviour expected of a professional athlete. \u201cWhen you are professional sportsperson at the top level of the game, I don\u2019t think it is something you should be doing. It is as simple as that,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cBut I will speak to him and see what he says about it. \u201cI want players here who are super-professional and focused on their football and I know he very much is. Young players will make mistakes but as long as they learn from them, that is important.\u201d Rodgers claimed that any disciplinary measures would be \u201csomething we will deal with internally\u201d but denied the recent controversies surrounding Sterling are proving a distraction. \u201cYou can see by the way he plays [that it is not]. He is a kid who is very strong willed and strong minded,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cHe should have had a hat-trick tonight. His performance was outstanding. Him and Philippe Coutinho were at a world-class level.\u201d Having written off Liverpool\u2019s chances of finishing in the top four after their recent defeat at Arsenal, Rodgers\u2019 stance has altered in the wake of City\u2019s consecutive losses to Crystal Palace and Manchester United. \u201cWe will fight to the very end,\u201d said a more confident Liverpool manager. \u201cWe are on a great run. We have won 10 of 13 games but had two disappointing results and it is always a crisis when you lose games. We knew we had to respond and have also got ourselves into the semi-final of the FA Cup. There are teams above us but as we saw last year there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes. The players and myself and very motivated to do the best we can but we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning.\u201d Rodgers confirmed Daniel Sturridge missed the win over Newcastle with a hip problem and remains a doubt for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
