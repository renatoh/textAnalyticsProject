Nicholas Kenyon, director of the Proms, said he expected the final audience figure to be about 2% down on last year, a fall he attributes to the festival starting midway between the atrocities in London on July 7 and the attempted bombings of July 21. The BBC, which puts more than \u00a34m into the festival, estimates that the number of tickets sold will top 250,000, taking the average attendance in the 5,000-plus-capacity hall above the 80% level, which has become its benchmark for success. More than 20 concerts were sold out. At the other end of the scale, this week's late-night appearance by the Nash Ensemble sold 9% of capacity. Proms starting at 10pm usually fare worse than earlier concerts, and account for seven of the eight lowest attendances this season. Kenyon said it would not be difficult to achieve a figure far higher than the 80% average, but that, paradoxically, would be a sign of failure. \"We know at the beginning of the season which concerts are going to be the extremely popular ones and which aren't,\" he said. \"That's not why we put them on. It's not the aim of the Proms to be 100% sold out.\" The concerts with relatively low attendances - Kenyon is quick to point out that a half-full Albert Hall equates to a full Barbican - are those with new music or what he calls \"rarities or slightly under-popular classics\". Large audiences will turn out if there is one premiere or rarity but are less inclined to go if there are two in one show. The Prom on July 26 had six pieces - Stravinsky's The Fairy's Kiss, a premiere by Detlev Glanert, a song cycle by Oliver Knussen, and three tone poems by Anatol Lyadov. It had a 28% audience capacity, with 1,290 people. \"I don't mind having a low attendance for that because there wasn't a single classic piece in it to draw a wide audience,\" insisted Kenyon. \"It was a very interesting and superbly performed programme.\" Far more disappointing, he said, was that the Royal Albert Hall was only three-quarters full for Mariss Jansons' second concert with the Concertgebouw, audience devotion to Brahms' 1st Symphony failing to allay \"suspicion\" of Lutoslawski's Concerto for Orchestra. Kenyon said audience numbers were primarily driven by the repertory line-up. But whereas Wagner, Brahms and Beethoven used to be sure-fire winners, big draws now were Mahler, Bruckner, Shostakovich and any of the popular concertos, such as Bruch's Violin Concerto, Grieg's Piano Concerto, and Brahms' 1st and 2nd Piano Concertos. But Kenyon, who next year celebrates 10 years in charge of the Proms concerts, has no intention of playing the numbers game. \"I would be uncomfortable with a season that consistently sold out because it had no adventure in it,\" he said. \"Also it would be quite a short-term thing because you would soon lose your audience.\" After the 20th performance of the Bruch violin concerto, prommers might be desperate for a spot of Detlev Glanert.
