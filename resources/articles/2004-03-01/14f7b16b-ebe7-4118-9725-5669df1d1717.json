These are exactly the sort of young people for whom the increased availability of cheap flights to the cultural centres of Europe have come as a godsend; the finest museums, cathedrals and palaces have never been so accessible. But apparently there are other children, although surely a tiny minority, for whom the prospect of spending a day or two immersed in history, art and architecture might not evoke quite the same sense of intellectual exhilaration. Take Rome, for example. It might be the eternal city, baroque home of the Catholic church and one of the most romantic places on earth, but the tiny, children's section of one guide book makes clear the parental challenges when it ominously advises that you pack a GameBoy. One man's Michelangelo and the ruined temple of Vespasian, it seems, is another child's boring old painting and dreary old stones. With this in mind, on a recent visit there with our 11-year-old, Arthur, and nine-year-old, Connie, initial thoughts of using Gibbon, or maybe something by Henry James, as guiding texts were jettisoned and instead we relied on Lizzie McGuire: The Movie, in which the enthusiastically charming American teen heroine gets swept round Rome on a scooter by an Italian pop star. And it turned out the film provides a pretty good primer for the city. Such is the close proximity of all the major sites that while your life might not be quite like the movie, the backdrops to it certainly are. On the first morning, just like Lizzie, we set out for the Colosseum. The 20-minute walk in the winter sunshine took us past the huge oval banked field that was once the Circus Maximus, the largest chariot track in ancient Rome. At the Colosseum itself we took up the offer of a guided tour from a tout - \u20ac8pp on top of the \u20ac8 entry charge - on the promise we would skip the huge queue. This proved true although it was also an unnerving experience as at one stage our children were taken away by the tour guide into a separate queue, out of eyesight, to get free entry. And to get the concession you must produce valid ID, no matter how obviously young the child. The tour group itself was ridiculously unwieldy at about 60 people but we did get an earthily entertaining, if perhaps not scrupulously accurate, lesson in history. The guide was particularly keen to tell us about prostitution at the venue pointing out how the men would drink three cups of gladiators' blood before approaching the ladies. \"Just like an early Viagra, yes?\" he laughed. The blank response from the listening children was reassuring, but probably also indicative of ongoing trauma following the queue fiasco. We were keen that our first meal in Rome should be authentic, so Hostaria al Gladiatore, directly opposite the Colosseum, was ruled out straight away. But a quick look down some neighbouring streets revealed no other eating places, and then the rain started, so the Gladiatore it was. However, once inside we were offered a genuinely good value \u20ac10 menu comprising bruschetta, pizza and a fruit salad. The staff were helpful and friendly, the atmosphere was relaxed. Tourist trap or not, we were actually treated like customers and not like cattle as we had been inside the Colosseum. By the next day, the rain had assumed monsoon proportions so we repeated the eating tactics at the Pantheon where, a few yards from the entrance to the great domed temple, Bar Pantheon came up trumps with toasted sandwiches, hot chocolate and, again, noticeably friendly and helpful service. In fact, the food was good everywhere and the clich\u00e9 about Italian waiters actually liking children proved true no matter what standard, or price, the restaurant. The rain storm and the huge queues ensured the Vatican museum and the Sistine chapel were bumped from the schedule, but St Peter's square was entertainingly incongruous as nuns, priests and monks scurried for shelter while trying to keep their mobile phones dry. And inside the sheer scale of St Peter's was suitably awe inspiring. Bernini's final work before he died, a monument to Pope Alexander VII, transfixes adults and children alike with the grandeur and ghoulishness of the late Pope supported by a hideously accurate but grotesquely enlarged golden skeleton. In a break in the weather, we managed to walk between the Trevi Fountain - \"this is where Lizzie met Paulo\" we chorused - the Spanish Steps and the Piazza Navona for an enormous banana split. Then on to the Palatine Hill, home of the Forum, where the business of empire was conducted, and where the emperors had their villas. Both sites are preserved well enough to provide a sense of walking through history. From up here we could see the apartment where we were staying The Palazzo al Velabro is staffed and has a small bar so there is a good combination of space and service. Just outside the front door is the enormous arch of Janus and the church of San Giorgio where, reputedly, Romulus and Remus were found by the she-wolf. Over the road are the astonishingly well preserved temples of the Forum Boarium and just beyond them the river Tiber itself. A couple of hundred yards away was another set of ruins that we had to pass on our way to and from the apartment. It was unmarked and we virtually ignored it for a couple of days. But while walking home on our last evening we stopped to give it a proper once over. The children, freed of tour guides and people taking pictures, looked closely at the buildings and came up with the theory that it might have been some sort of prison. Back in the apartment we checked the books and, yes, a medieval prison had indeed been built on the site of three ancient temples. It was a brief, but hugely rewarding, engagement with Rome's past and, as proud parents, we prepared ourselves for the children treating themselves to ancient Greek lessons as soon as we got home. But, as was quickly pointed out, the DVD of Lizzie McGuire is also available, so maybe first things first.
