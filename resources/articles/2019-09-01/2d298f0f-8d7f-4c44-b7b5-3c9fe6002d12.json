The announcement by the Department for Education (DfE) that it will push for higher pay for newly-qualified teachers was revealed by the Guardian last week as part of the government\u2019s \u201cback to school\u201d policy rollout, including increased funding for state schools. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, will call for an increase of up to \u00a36,000 a year for new teachers by the 2022-23 academic year in a letter to the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body (STRB), the independent panel that advises on pay and working conditions. \u201cI want the best talent to be drawn to the teaching profession and for schools to compete with biggest employers in the labour market and recruit the brightest and the best into teaching,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cTeachers should be in no doubt that this government fully backs them in every stage of their career, starting with rewarding starting salaries.\u201d The announcement includes the government\u2019s commitment to fully fund higher payments into the teachers pension scheme, with the DfE saying that members would benefit from employer contributions of 23.6% on top of their salary towards their pension every year. The increased pay and pension contributions form part of the \u00a314bn in education spending announced by Williamson and Boris Johnson last week, with most of the increase directed towards core school funding. But analysis by the Sunday Times suggests the bulk of the new money will overwhelmingly benefit schools in the constituencies of Conservative MPs, while those in deprived areas of London and the north of England will see little improvement. More specifically, the analysis found more than 93% of the schools receiving funding increases of more than \u00a3100 per pupil were in Conservative-held constituencies. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the pay increases for new teachers were \u201cdesperately needed\u201d to improve recruitment. \u201cAt present, the government is missing its recruitment targets every year, and a third of new teachers leave the profession before they\u2019ve completed five years\u2019 service,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy situation that needs an immediate remedy.\u201d The DfE said Williamson would also ask the STRB to look at the way teachers qualify for salary increases, including the use of progression pay points. \u201cProgression will continue to be linked to performance ensuring the investment best supports the recruitment and retention,\u201d the DfE said. Mary Bousted, the National Education Union\u2019s joint general secretary, said the government was admitting it was \u201cbonkers\u201d for each school to set its own pay policies. \u201cThe NEU wants the government to go further and reinstate statutory progression pay points, in negotiation with teacher unions, so the pay system is transparent, open and fair and so that proper incentives are put in place for experienced teachers to stay in teaching,\u201d Bousted said. The DfE will also introduce a programme of \u201cambassador schools\u201d to champion flexible working for teachers. \u201cWe know that the lack of flexible working opportunities is often cited as a reason for leaving. Other sectors have embraced flexible working and the benefits it provides \u2013 I want to see the same in schools,\u201d Williamson added. Angela Rayner MP, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cAfter sitting at the cabinet table agreeing to years of real terms pay cuts for teachers, Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson have finally admitted that austerity has failed our schools. But even now, teachers will have to wait years for the promised pay rise, and there is every chance that if there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit this will be yet another promise that isn\u2019t kept.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
