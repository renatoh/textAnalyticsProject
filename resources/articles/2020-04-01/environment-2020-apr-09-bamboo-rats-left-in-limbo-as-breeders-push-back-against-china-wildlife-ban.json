It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says. But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China\u2019s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai\u2019s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over. China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t been told what to do, except that we can\u2019t sell or release or even cull them until further notice, so we\u2019re still keeping them, and that\u2019s been costing us about 300 yuan [\u00a334] per day for the past three months,\u201d Yongcai, 30, told the Guardian by phone. \u201cWe hope to transition to other types of business but until it\u2019s clear what to do with the rats, it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would need funding and the right facility for that.\u201d Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak. Certain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses. The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the Guardian could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats. Yet, local governments, the state forestry and grassland administration and their provincial bureaus have encouraged and supported all sorts of wildlife farms. \u201cThe real number could be hundreds or even over a thousand kinds [of wild animal species] with no regulation,\u201d said Yin Shanchuan, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation who has long been involved in investigations with the group. \u201cSomehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,\u201d Yin said. Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak. The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the Guardian on 3 April. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to invest a lot, you don\u2019t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.\u201d Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China\u2019s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government. But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to \u00a323,000 per operation. Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. \u201cAfter the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,\u201d he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he\u2019ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful. Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn\u2019t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he\u2019ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that\u2019s just for the impoverished household breeders,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cFor regular breeders, we\u2019re still on our own and awaiting a decision.\u201d What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released. Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer. Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China\u2019s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease. \u201cI am optimistic that bamboo rats won\u2019t be included in the livestock and poultry list,\u201d Aili Kang, Asia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told the Guardian. \u201cCurrently, the law does not use very biological or ecological definitions. Nor do they use a very pure [definitions] from a zoonotic disease kind of component.\u201d As for Yongcai, he understands that animals can carry viruses and disease, and while he previously sanitised his operation once a month, he is now required to do so each week for the rats that remain in limbo. \u201cI don\u2019t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
