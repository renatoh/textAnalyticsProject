He said the fact that United is a public limited company meant it would always be \"in play\" and would never have the long-term security afforded by Roman Abramovich's private ownership of Chelsea. Kenyon said he was glad he was no longer on United's board and faced with the Glazer decision, adding that he was much happier operating under private ownership. He also suggested the primary beneficiaries of going public were key shareholders rather than the club. His comments are unlikely to ease relations with Sir Alex Ferguson, who last week accused him of holding his former employer \"in contempt\" after he dined publicly with Rio Ferdinand. Speaking at the Soccerex conference in London, Kenyon said: \"Within the industry the preference would always be for private ownership over public. \"There was a . . . time that it was seen as the golden goose for clubs to go to [the] market. Manchester United gained liquidity in shares, which allowed some money to go to key shareholders, but apart from about \u00a316m the bulk of the \u00a3150m-\u00a3160m we invested in players and stadia came from within the football club. \"As a public company you are always in play, and in terms of long-term planning that makes life difficult. As a private business it means that literally three of us [at Chelsea] can decide what to do.\" Kenyon reiterated his five-year plan for Chelsea, which he hopes will see the business self-sufficient by 2009. He said the club would focus on \"brand building\" in four key markets - \"London, Russia, where we feel we have a competitive advantage, China - not Asia - and north America\". His focus on London indicates Chelsea will seek to challenge Arsenal's success both on and off the field. He declined to say whether Ashley Cole would form part of the merchandise drive. The FA and Premier League staff at Soccerex will have been pleased to hear Kenyon reiterate his faith in collective bargaining on TV rights and in the value of international football. \"National team football is critical to the promotion of the sport . . . there will always be stresses and strains but no one will ever say we should not have it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
