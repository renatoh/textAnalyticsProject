Unrepentant about making a pretend shooting gesture at the Conservative leader's back on his Manchester council estate, Benchill, Ryan Florence gave a rundown of life, drugs and firearms. Walking his staffordshire bull terrier, with his tracksuit trousers hitched up to show his electronic tag for breaching theft parole, he said that \"shooters and weed\" were the local norm for teenagers. \"You can get a gun for about 30 or 40 quid. They're not very good. They are just blank firers which have been drilled through. If you pay a bit more, about 50 quid, you can get something better - all ready to go. You can pay as much as two grand.\" Florence, who is 17 and jobless, said that he belonged to a gang - that other trigger word in the current youth crime debate - called the Benchill Mad Dogs. He refused to answer questions about whether he had ever fired a gun but said he did not own one. He said: \"It's no good everyone else having guns and you not. You would be fucking dead. Lots of my friends have got them. They need them for protection and in case it kicks off and there's trouble. If we get rival gangs coming round here causing problems then they need to be sorted out.\" As Florence turned to drug use, one of his friends lit a joint by the side of the road. Florence said: \"Drugs are everywhere here. I smoke weed every day and all my friends do as well. There's nothing wrong with it as long as you don't get caught. \"I have tried sniff (cocaine) a few times but I didn't think much of it so I don't do it any more.\" Two men then drove up in a silver Vauxhall Corsa and offered the group stolen mobile phones and pirate DVDs from the boot of the car. Before leaving, Florence, who said he had been in custody three times for burglary, mugging and stealing cars, said: \"I'm not bothered about the stories in the papers about me. They can say what they want about me. \"Guns are a way of life around here. Everyone has got them. There are shootings every week but they don't get heard about because no one wants to grass.\" A friend, who did not want to be named, said: \"There is so little work around here, even if you want to go straight there are no jobs. People end up selling drugs just to get by.\" Greg Davis, who helps run the community centre visited by Mr Cameron and has been selected to stand for the Tories in local elections, said he felt Florence's behaviour underlined the Tory leader's message. He said: \"People around here aren't scared of terrorists or Bin Laden - they're scared of being jumped by 10-year-olds when they go to buy their paper.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
