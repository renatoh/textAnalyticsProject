As an organisation that has in its gift the only sporting event that challenges the Olympics as a potential money-spinner, the scope for the exchange of bribes is, by any rational analysis, limited only by the transparency and accountability of those involved. Which, in the case of Fifa, appears to be very little. The way football's global authority manages the international game brings dishonour to almost everyone involved. And that is only the tip of it. The records of rigged internal elections and lavish and unexplained payments between promoters, national representatives and members of Fifa's executive committee itself, of which more evidence emerged in the Sunday Times this weekend, corrupt relations at every level of the game. Members of the FA who dismissed a BBC Panorama report on Fifa malpractice in 2010, at the time of the failed England bid to host the 2018 cup, should be feeling deeply embarrassed. These allegations are not just bad for the reputation of football. They normalise the kind of behaviour that undermines efforts to promote global transparency where its impact is greatest \u2013 in deals to extract resources that could transform millions of lives, but too often end up enriching a handful of individuals. Cleaning up Fifa is important even to those of us who would rather have our teeth drawn one by one than watch a single match beamed from Brazil. But it matters most to international football itself, the game that in the coming month will inspire dreams of glory in another generation of children. Fifa appears entirely deaf to the insult that its repeated denials of wrongdoing represent to every fan who loves the sport. This latest attack has been met with silence, just like many previous ones. If it wants to be believed, it should end its interminable foot-dragging and bring in extensive reforms based on the kind of accountability that would open its processes to impartial examination. The first evidence that real change might be coming would be an urgent, positive response. It is regrettable that the inquiry the Fifa chairman, Sepp Blatter, belatedly commissioned from the US lawyer Michael Garcia in 2012 cannot meet its original target to report in time for the Fifa congress on the eve of the World Cup. He must report as soon as it is over. But his report is not needed to establish that the 2010 process by which the executive committee awarded the world cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022 was unsafe. It is enough that several committee members have subsequently resigned over unexplained payments and the FBI and the IRS are examining the affairs of two, Jack Warner of the Carribean and the US soccer boss Chuck Blazer. . There should be a new vote not only on Qatar, but \u2013 since the votes were taken at the same time \u2013 also on Russia. But there is no point in repeating the process if it involves largely the same personnel and with no enhanced accountability in place. First, Fifa itself must be cleaned up. But there are already signs of trouble. In April, Alexandra Wrage resigned from the internal governance committee charged with proposing reforms on contentious areas like conflicts of interest, warning that progress was too slow and the prospects of getting approval too remote. Mr Blatter, whose campaign to be re-elected is linked with progress on reform, should look at how the International Olympics Committee has transformed itself since the scandal of Salt Lake City. If no one thinks the IOC is perfect, at least it is no longer a byword for dodgy deals. But its programme of change was only the starting point. It needed strong leadership prepared to take vested interests head on. Football is a universal game beloved of millions, ordinary people who feel an abiding sense of belonging. It is the people's game, not the plutocrats'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
