Although the selectors will finally announce their squad for Lord's tomorrow, 48 hours later than intended, their eyes will be fixed on events today at Canterbury and Headingley in the hope that Butcher and Gough pull through. With those two's fitness confirmed, England's squad would just about manage an appearance of normality. Without them, there could be a scramble for reinforcements as late as next Tuesday, only 48 hours before the off. Butcher has not played since knee surgery a month ago, so he will be particularly keen to find a semblance of form for Surrey, who will be looking to live up to their status as short-odds First Division favourites against Kent at Canterbury. Gough, also afflicted by knee trouble, will need to be at his most boisterous to satisfy Yorkshire, bottom of the division and desperate for a win against second-bottom Lancashire in what could be one of the most tense Roses matches for years. David Byas, the rejected Yorkshire captain who abandoned his retirement to join the old enemy, recognises that Gough, however vulnerable, will not be able to coast. \"Roses matches are always tough but this one will be like Tyson v Lewis,\" he said. Butcher, confident that his rehabilitation will prove more straightforward than Gough's, would prefer to retain his No3 position in the order at Lord's. He has averaged 51 in 20 Test innings there since his recall a year ago against the Australians at Edgbaston. But Marcus Trescothick's thumb injury, a multiple fracture which has ruled him out for the rest of the season, looks certain to force Butcher to revert to opener. The only alternative - and an unlikely one - would be for the selectors to take a punt on a Test debut for Kent's opening batsman Robert Key. There would be no better time for Key to make a hundred than today, against Surrey, with an anxious England selector looking on. Gough's return at Lord's would entail nine days of intensive cricket in the next 11, and his recovery so far has not been plain sailing. But England's options are limited, with Andrew Caddick's intercostal injury making him a non-starter and with Alex Tudor taking anti-inflammatory tablets to ease shin discomfort. Tudor is a major doubt, but the selectors are hoping that rest and tablets might work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
