The connections of Grey Abbey, another leading contender for a championship which has cut up rapidly in recent weeks, also suggested yesterday their horse might not run if no rain arrives. Kingscliff was installed as favourite for the Gold Cup when Best Mate, the three-time winner, was ruled out last week, but had drifted in recent days as rumours suggested all was not well with him. \"He worked moderately this morning and I'm just not happy with him,\" his trainer Robert Alner said yesterday. \"They've got to be right for any race, but particularly for the Gold Cup. It wouldn't be fair to the horse, the owner or the jockey to run him if he's not 100%. \"We just have to face the reality. At least it's nothing major, it's not muscular or tendons or anything like that. We'll get him right and aim for the Punchestown Festival now.\" In Kingscliff's absence, his designated jockey Andrew Thornton will replace Mick Fitzgerald on Sir Rembrandt, Alner's other Gold Cup entry. \"He also worked this morning and I was very happy with how he went,\" Alner said. \"He looks to be in great form.\" Any rain would be a big boost to Sir Rembrandt's chances, though, and its failure to materialise as expected yesterday has also put Grey Abbey's participation in doubt. \"I am going to declare him and he will be coming down on Thursday night,\" Howard Johnson, Grey Abbey's trainer, said yesterday. \"I'll have a look at him when he gets here and then again on Friday morning. \"If the ground gets any faster, I don't think he will run. I'll just have to monitor the going and see what the weather does.\" Rule Supreme, the winner of the Hennessy Gold Cup in Ireland last month, will also miss the Gold Cup in favour of tomorrow's stayers' hurdle. \"There will only be eight or nine runners in the World Hurdle,\" Willie Mullins, Rule Supreme's trainer, said, \"and he jumps hurdles fantastic. That race has been our target all season and there were too many negatives to go for the Gold Cup.\" But Thierry Doumen, who rode the hot World Hurdle favourite Baracouda to his two victories in the race, yesterday summed up the task facing Rule Supreme when he said: \"He floats along and is very elastic. It is effortless. You seldom come across [such] very good horses - there are few of them on earth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
