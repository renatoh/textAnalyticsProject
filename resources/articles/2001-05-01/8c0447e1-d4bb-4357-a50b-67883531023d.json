The party reached out to men behaving badly everywhere back in March when, as part of the Budget, iron man Gordon Brown froze the duty on beer. Lucky residents of Glasgow's student-saturated West End no longer even have to worry about spilling their imported ales (although obviously they'd be well advised to avoid toppling Prescott's bitter) as they have been sent Labour beer mats. The saloon-bar pledge card celebrates Government achievements as 'Labour Substance' and on the flip side berates 'Tory Froth', taunting long-time wannabe lad William Hague over his boast to have slurped 14 pints. A particularly unreliable source assures The Observer that a Loaded -like version of the Labour manifesto has been produced to square up to the SNP's Cosmo festo. Were Labour to have another shot at publishing its plans for Scotland it might like to look again at the photograph on page 15. The caption reads: 'Scottish idyll at Loch Katrine... Labour energetically promotes the tourism industry and Scotland's first national parks will open in 2003.' Worryingly for the tourism industry the picture shows Scottish idyll not at Loch Katrine but at the town of Plockton, home of Hamish Macbeth and more than 150 miles away on Loch Carron. When it comes to geography, the Scottish Nationalists don't fare much better. In the Kilmarnock and Loudon constituency they would so love to prise away from Labour's Des Browne, the SNP has circulated a leaflet that talks up its chances of taking East Ayrshire. East Ayrshire may well include Kilmarnock for council purposes, but a parliamentary constituency it most definitely is not. Despite a sterling effort to appear interested, the mask slipped for a number of 'demonstrators' at St Enoch's Square, Glasgow, on Wednesday. As the Labour manifesto was being unveiled they bore grinning Tony Blair faces and sandwich boards questioning the future of the pound. But as Enterprise Minister Wendy Alexander exited the event, a perplexed Blair muttered: 'Who's that?' As for their identity; hired hands rather than political activists, one suspects. Last week's mask wearers reappeared as binmen on Friday. Having taunted the SNP outside its Hampden campaign launch by impersonating Hague and thanking John Swinney for his 'support' they made for the capital. Carrying rubbish bags, the Glasgow students were accompanied by a bin lorry bearing banners which read: 'A vote for the SNP is a wasted vote.' It may not have been enough to take the shine off the Nats' glitzy manifesto show but they were worried enough to move the binmen on. Back to the bar. The UK Independence Party followed Tommy Sheridan's example by launching its campaign from a pub. The new political home for a large number of disaffected Tories may not, on the surface, appear to have much in common with the Scottish Socialists, and when asked how he felt about having inspired the UKIP, Sheridan quipped: 'Who?' As the SSP went on to promote its manifesto from a church in Edinburgh, all eyes (well, two) are on the Eurosceptics to see if they pop up in a pulpit next to preach their message.
