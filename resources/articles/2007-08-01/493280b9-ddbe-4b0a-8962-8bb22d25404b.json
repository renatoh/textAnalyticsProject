And with \u00a3343m spent on players this summer, the Premiership has a slew of interesting new faces poised to make a splash on front and back pages, or at least mildly jazz up the trails for Match of the Day. Most likely to do a car ad is clean-cut Fernando Torres, Liverpool's new \u00a323m signing. Possessed of hordes of adoring female fans in his native Madrid, Torres made an immediate good impression by arriving in Liverpool on Easyjet. He also has his name tattooed on his arm in Elvish, in tribute to his passion for JRR Tolkein. At Chelsea look out for the Peruvian Claudio Pizarro, who left Bayern Munich under a cloud, one of several players accused by his manager of spending too much time \"putting gel in his hair\". Still at Chelsea, fellow newcomer Florent Malouda has promised to celebrate scoring with his signature \"Crazy Frog dance\". Also implicated in the Bayern gel furore was new Blackburn Rovers man Roque Santa Cruz, a Paraguayan who arrived at Munich airport carrying just a guitar after signing as an 18-year-old. He was voted \"sexiest man at the 2006 World Cup\" by German magazine Kicker. He also sang on Ich, Roque by German band Sportfreunde Stiller in 2004. Of all the new arrivals, Arsenal's Bakari Sagna probably has the best hair, a superb dye-and-plait combination. And if it's surreal double-acts you want the Premiership can, as ever, oblige, with the pairing of tarnished ex-England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson and his scarcely credible new boss at Manchester City, former Thai prime minister Thaksin \"Frank\" Shinawatra. Shinawatra has been accused of corruption and human rights abuses. Sven, meanwhile, brought us Nancy Del'Olio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
