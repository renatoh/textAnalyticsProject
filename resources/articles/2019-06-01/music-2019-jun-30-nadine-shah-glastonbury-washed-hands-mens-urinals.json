Great! I haven\u2019t done it properly before and I feel like a punter this year because I\u2019m doing a featured vocal with the Love Unlimited Synth Orchestra, singing the songs of Barry White, not my own solo set. Charles Hazlewood is conducting. His daughter has cerebral palsy and I think it inspired him to start collaborating with other people, so there\u2019s going to be me, Gruff Rhys, Lianne La Havas, Larry Heard and the saxophonist YolanDa Brown performing with the British Paraorchestra. How well do you embody Barry White? It\u2019s hilarious. I\u2019m going to be Pakistani geordie Barry White! Of the two songs I\u2019ve got, both have a sexy talking bit at the beginning. So I said to Charles, I\u2019m not going to do that bit, right? And he said: \u201cOh, but you must.\u201d And I said: Charles, in my accent, talking sexy? Lines like: \u201cAnd you know you want it\u201d and \u201cYou know I\u2019m gonna get it together and it\u2019s gonna be great\u201d? It\u2019s going to be a really niche sexy thing, aye. You know when you\u2019re making love to somebody and a really cheesy song comes on and you just laugh? Hearing me say \u201csexy\u201d things in my accent, that\u2019s going to debone anyone. Who have you seen so far? The first band I\u2019ve seen is Idles. I\u2019ve known them from the beginning. It\u2019s been amazing to see their growth after they\u2019ve worked so hard. It was a milestone for them. Apparently earlier, the singer Joe was walking around with his daughter Frida in a babygrow and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of being at Glasto with my child.\u201d I cried the whole way through. Who\u2019s the most famous person you\u2019ve ever met at Glastonbury? I played three years ago and the Dalai Lama came and played the stage I was playing on. I met the Dalai Lama! What did you say to him? I just said: \u201cHiya mate, have a nice time.\u201d It should have been much better. Whenever I meet a significant celebrity, or someone I admire, I always mess it up. When I met PJ Harvey the first time, which was outside a dry cleaners in London Bridge, all I could muster was: \u201cAh, PJ Harvey, dry cleaning? Posh!\u201d That was it. She walked away. Have you ever had to run away from someone at Glasto? Jarvis Cocker has run away from me! I\u2019ve met him about four times and every time, he\u2019s literally walked backwards away from me, or sideways. He was supposed to do the Barry White performance, too, but he pulled out. He probably heard I was playing. What\u2019s your most awkward festival encounter? I once went to the loo and when I went to wash my hands I picked up this bit of yellow soap \u2013 but it turns out I was washing my hands in the men\u2019s urinals and using one of those cakes they put in there to soak up the smells. This lad was filming it and saying: \u201cNadine Shah\u2019s washing her hands in the men\u2019s urinals.\u201d I gave him \u00a320 to delete the video. He did, thank God. You must have had some magical encounters too? One year, I was sat by the campfire at the Leftfield stage and the Buzzcocks were sat next to me. The smoke was in my face and my eyes were streaming and they started singing Smoke Gets in Your Eyes at me. It was surreal. You\u2019re in the middle of recording a new record \u2013 what can we expect? I always want to have a coherent theme and it\u2019s ended up being a collection of stories from the women I love most in the world, the most inspiring women, including my mum. I\u2019m really lucky to be surrounded by them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
