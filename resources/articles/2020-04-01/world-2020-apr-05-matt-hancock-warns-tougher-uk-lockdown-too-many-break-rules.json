Warning about the possibility of moves towards a fuller lockdown as seen in places such as France and Italy, Matt Hancock confirmed that under current rules, sitting or lying in parks was not permitted. \u201cSunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,\u201d Hancock, who has himself recently emerged from isolation after contracting the virus, told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to say this but I do because the whole country wants to come through this crisis.\u201d Lambeth council in south London said Brockwell park would be closed on Sunday because so many people had sunbathed there on Saturday. \u201cDespite clear advice, over 3,000 people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups,\u201d it tweeted on Saturday. With sunny weather again expected across large parts of the country on Sunday, Hancock told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that people should be leaving home only for the four prescribed reasons \u2013 work as needed, buying food, for health reasons or for exercise \u2013 and he said the latter could be withdrawn if physical distancing was not being properly followed. \u201cI think this example of exercise is a really important one, because we\u2019ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it\u2019s OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say, \u2018Well, if I can exercise then it\u2019s fine for me to do other things,\u2019 then I\u2019m afraid we will have to take action. \u201cSo my message is really clear. If you don\u2019t want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home then you\u2019ve got to follow the rules, and the vast majority people are following the rules.\u201d On the target announced last week to massively increase testing for coronavirus to up to 100,000 per day by the end of April, Hancock said he was \u201cabsolutely determined that we get there\u201d but urged caution. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard, and it\u2019s going to require an awful lot of people to put their shoulders to the wheel across the life sciences industry and the NHS,\u201d he said. Hancock was backed by the newly elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said his party would support either a ban on outdoor exercise or on non-essential work if it was needed to curb the spread of Covid-19. \u201cYes we would. We do have to take whatever steps are necessary,\u201d said Starmer, who was announced as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s successor on Saturday after winning more than 56% of Labour members\u2019 votes. \u201cSocial distancing, staying indoors, is really difficult for people. It\u2019s particularly difficult if you don\u2019t have a garden, if you\u2019re in a flat. And I know there are a lot of people in overcrowded accommodation. But we\u2019ve got to get through this,\u201d he said. However, Angela Rayner, who was elected as Labour\u2019s deputy leader, sounded a more cautious note, telling the Sophy Ridge show: \u201cIt\u2019s all right for people who\u2019ve got big houses and huge back gardens to say that, but if you\u2019re stuck in inadequate accommodation, you\u2019ve got no back garden, nowhere to go, and you\u2019re on top of each other, people should do social distancing, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.\u201d Starmer, who played down the idea of some form of national unity government, said he would \u201cask difficult questions\u201d over coronavirus, but avoid \u201copposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d. Starmer said he had come to an arrangement with Boris Johnson to receive ministerial briefings on the virus, and wanted to be constructive. He added: \u201cBut asking those difficult questions matters. You can see that when difficult questions were asked on testing things began to move. The same thing with equipment on the frontline. Scrutiny is important here.\u201d Speaking earlier on the Marr show, Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, one of the scientists whose modelling of the virus helped prompt the lockdown, said it was difficult to know when the measures might be eased as it depended on how quickly case numbers fell. \u201cThere is no point, having gone through this effort, in releasing a lockdown at a point where case numbers are still high and will resurge even faster than we have seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown.\u201d Ferguson said it was also hard to predict the death toll in the UK but he believed these could be \u201canywhere between 7,000 or so up to a little over 20,000\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
