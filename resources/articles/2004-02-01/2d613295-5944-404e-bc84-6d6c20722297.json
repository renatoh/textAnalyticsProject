GWR said its non-digital radio revenues rose 12% in the three months to the end of December compared with last year because of improvements in the advertising market. This was followed in January by a year-on-year rise of 10%, the company said. The positive trading update comes in the same week that Capital Radio and Heart owner Chrysalis reported growth in radio revenues. It is the strongest sign yet that radio has emerged from the advertising slump. GWR said its local radio group, which accounts for about 70% of revenues, reported a 13% rise in revenues for the third quarter. At Classic FM - where GWR has been targeting a younger audience - national revenues increased 13% in the quarter compared with last year. GWR said recent ratings figures showing a rise in the number of listeners aged between 35 and 54 would \"make the station more competitive in the advertising marketplace in offering advertisers mass access to the lucrative younger market\". The GWR executive chairman, Ralph Bernard, said the last three months of 2003 had been \"notably strong\". He also hailed the growth of digital radio, in which GWR has invested significantly, owning 63% of the national platform Digital One, three national and 60 local digital stations. With the price of digital radio sets falling and new models entering the market, GWR is hoping 2004 will be a watershed year for digital. Mr Bernard called last month for the government to set a switch-off date for analogue radio as it has for TV. \"Digital radio continues to gain acceptance,\" he said. \"Roberts has already entered the market with a strong range of products and we eagerly await the arrival of the Sony range this year.\" Earlier this week Chrysalis set the pace for the radio recovery by announcing a 19% hike in radio revenues in the five months to the end of January. Capital Radio added to the feelgood factor by reporting a 5% rise in revenues in the last three months of 2003. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
