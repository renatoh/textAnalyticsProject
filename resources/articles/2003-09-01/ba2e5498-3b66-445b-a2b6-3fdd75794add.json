Suddenly they begin fighting for breath as the air in the carriage is poisoned by a mystery gas. There is panic and the train lurches to a halt in a black tunnel. And so, according to the government, the nightmare begins. This is the scenario that will be tested this weekend as emergency planners stage the most realistic live disaster exercise of its kind in the capital. The passengers will be 60 police cadets, the mystery chemical a fake, but the reaction of officials and the emergency services will be as close to reality as government planners can make them. The purpose is to test the procedures for mass decontamination in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service equipment will receive a realistic time test, including chemical suits bought for \u00a3350,000. The exercise will also test arrangements at University College Hospital, which would take most of the casualties. The hospital will be challenged to deal with stricken passengers from the scene and those who turn up after suffering a delayed reaction. Medical staff will wear protective clothing and set up a decontamination unit to strip and wash suspected casualties. Since the attacks in America on September 11, the government has staged a series of exercises away from public view, involving ministers, the intelligence services and the most senior emergency service personnel who sit on the top-level Cobra committee. But the exercise this weekend will focus on the response on the ground. Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said this week that London is almost certain to suffer a terrorist attack, but ministers stress that the exercise is not a response to any specific threat. However, the capital's emergency planning is not without controversy. The Guardian has learned that members of the Fire Brigades Union are refusing to take part in trials relating to their new chemical suits, because they say their members should receive additional payments of \u00a3100 a day to so. There is also disagreement about the number of firefighters needed to operate vehicles after a chemical attack. Outlining how the exercise will work, Nick Raynsford, the minister for London and chairman of the emergency panel London Resilience, said: \"London has faced many challenges and threats in the 2,000 years of its history and not least in the last 30 years. As we saw last week with the power failure in some parts of the city, there are always new lessons to be learned.\" The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, said the exercise would provide valuable information. \"Sunday's exercise is a sensible and practical step in the fight against terrorism and allows us to test contingency plans.\" Ken Livingstone, London's mayor and deputy chairman of London Resilience, said the capital had long coped with the threat from terrorists. \"We have had to be vigilant, but we have also got on with our lives. Now we have to be prepared for any eventuality and any emergency.\" The exercise will begin at midday. Access to streets within a quarter of a mile from Bank station will be restricted but the emergency operation itself will take place in the immediate vicinity of the station in an area about the size of a football pitch. About 700 people will be involved. The disaster will unfold in stages. Bank was chosen because it is a deep underground station and therefore replicates one of the more serious situations the emergency services are likely to face. The train will run from the Waterloo and City platform because that line is closed on Sundays. All other trains on other lines will pass straight through Bank and Monument, the station with which it has a direct link. The initial responsibility for dealing with the atrocity will rest with the train driver. He will have to warn those above ground that something has happened on his train and start dealing with the stricken passengers. The Metropolitan police will have overall control. Its officers and others from the City of London force and British Transport police will immediately try to secure the scene. Mick Shaw of the London Fire Brigades Union said the disputes about suits and emergency vehicles would not affect the exercise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
