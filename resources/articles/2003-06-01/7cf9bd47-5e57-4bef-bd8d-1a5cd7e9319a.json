Dassu, 44, looks super-fit and put her younger challengers to shame with a final-round 70 for a six-under total of 282 and a two-shot win over Australia's Corinne Dibnah, Italy's Sophie Sandolo and Spain's Ana-Belen Sanchez. It was the biggest pay day - she earned \u00a327,000 - in a career that had produced just five tournament wins prior to this, the last at the 1996 Compaq Open. \"I just cannot believe it,\" she said. \"This is definitely the most special win and now I think I will retire at the end of the season. Today, I was saved by my putting.\" But it was a huge let-down for France's Virginie Auffret. The 25-year-old novice was six in front with six to play, but she dropped seven shots as her nerves and her putting collapsed. With a 77, she finished in a tie for fifth - still a career best - with Elisabeth Esterl and Iben Tinning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
