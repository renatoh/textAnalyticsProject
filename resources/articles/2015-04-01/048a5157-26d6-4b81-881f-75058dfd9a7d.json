In her only newspaper interview before the manifesto\u2019s launch on Monday, she dismissed Labour leader Ed Miliband\u2019s rebuff of her offer of support last week as \u201cpre-election talk\u201d and insisted that the SNP had \u201ca vested interest in being a constructive participant\u201d in supporting a Labour government. Scotland\u2019s first minister and leader of the SNP told the Guardian: \u201cWith fixed-term parliaments, it gives parties in a minority-government situation \u2013 [where] hopefully the SNP will be in a position of influence \u2013 huge ability to change the direction of a government without bringing a government down. \u201cThere are very limited circumstances in that act where you can trigger a general election, but what you can do is build alliances to change the direction of a government on particular issues and that is what the SNP would seek to do.\u201d Her remarks follow repeated efforts by the Conservatives to highlight the influence Sturgeon\u2019s party could exert at a time when her party is projected to win 50 or more MPs while both Labour and the Conservatives fall short of an overall majority. Earlier on Sunday, David Cameron argued that a minority Labour administration supported by the SNP would be calamitous for Britain. In a combative interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr, the prime minister said: \u201cThis would be the first time in our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of our country, and I think that is a frightening prospect.\u201d At one point, Cameron appeared to question whether the SNP had any right to influence policy at Westminster, saying: \u201cThe SNP do not want to come to Westminster to contribute to a government. They want to come to Westminster to break up our country.\u201d The SNP manifesto, launched on Monday, commits the party\u2019s MPs to participate in votes on major issues south of the border, including a bill to reverse the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. Sturgeon responded: \u201cTo now hear David Cameron question the legitimacy of MPs that Scotland would democratically elect will infuriate lots of people across Scotland. On the NHS, these votes have a knock-on effect to Scotland\u2019s budgets so it\u2019s not just legitimate that we vote, I think it\u2019s absolutely essential.\u201d The manifesto will consciously cast the SNP as a party of government for the whole of the UK, with plans to reverse cuts to disability benefits and the roll-out of universal credit, as well as pushing formal recognition of a Palestinian State. The party leader dismissed as \u201cjust election talk\u201d Miliband\u2019s assertion during the BBC challengers debate last week that he would not work with the SNP. She said: \u201cIf we\u2019re in a situation where Ed Miliband doesn\u2019t have a majority but we have more anti-Tory MPs than Tory MPs, he\u2019ll have to make the decision whether he wants to work with the SNP to keep the Tories out or let the Tories in. \u201cI think he will understand the reality of that position if that\u2019s what he wakes up to on 8 May.\u201d Sturgeon said voters outside Scotland had \u201ca right to know how the SNP would use its influence\u201d. She added: \u201cI absolutely understand why voters in other parts of the UK might have a suspicion about SNP motives in Westminster and I\u2019ve got a responsibility to reassure them about that. \u201cThe way I do that is very simple. I\u2019ve not hidden and I\u2019ll never hide the fact that I want Scotland to be an independent country. But as long as we\u2019re part of the Westminster system, it\u2019s really important to people in Scotland that we get good decisions coming out of Westminster. So we\u2019ve got a vested interest in being a constructive participant. \u201cIt\u2019s saying to voters in other parts of the UK: you don\u2019t have to be scared of the SNP having a big influence because there is a vested interest on our part in helping to make politics at Westminster better.\u201d She denied that her consistent failure to rule out another referendum on independence put at risk the progressive alliance that she seeks at Westminster, with Labour and other parties, saying it would be \u201cundemocratic\u201d of her to rule out another referendum. \u201cDemocratically, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s right for me or any other politician to say, regardless of the circumstances and regardless of public opinion, I rule it out,\u201d she said. Sturgeon argued that there was no contradiction in her deputy, Stewart Hosie, telling the Sunday Politics Scotland programme earlier in the day that SNP MPs could vote against Treasury estimates on specific issues such as Trident. \u201cOur opposition to Trident is very clear, very firm, very long-standing, very principled and we would seek to build an alliance to prevent the renewal of Trident. Ian Murray [the current Labour MP for Edinburgh South] said last week that he would never vote for the renewal of Trident so there are people within Labour ranks who we could build alliances with as well as from the Greens and Plaid Cymru.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
