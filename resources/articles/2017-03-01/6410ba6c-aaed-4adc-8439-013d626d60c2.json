Asked if he could perhaps describe it in literally any other way, he laughs. \u201cI can\u2019t! There\u2019s no way!\u201d As far as whetting the appetites of Marvel fanatics goes, it\u2019s a little counterproductive. Thor: Ragnarok will be watched by many more people who are familiar with the franchise than those who know Waititi\u2019s work \u2013 but this may be the film that makes the New Zealand director a household name. The big-budget Thor is a far cry from the Flight of the Conchords, of which Waititi wrote and directed a few episodes, and from What We Do In The Shadows, the 2014 vampire mockumentary he made with Jemaine Clement. And it\u2019s almost the antithesis of Hunt for the Wilderpeople: the family friendly little-Kiwi-film-that-could, which was a surprise hit at box offices around the world last year. But while the types of projects may differ wildly, his treatment of them \u2013 the bit that makes them \u201cTaika-esque\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t. Even Waititi\u2019s government-funded anti-drug-driving campaign, Tinnyvision \u2013 made in collaboration with Snapchat in 2014 \u2013 has the same warm, sly humour of his features. And yet, after 41 years\u2019 experience of being \u201cTaika-esque\u201d himself, he still struggles to describe it. \u201cIf someone asked, \u2018What are your films like?\u2019, the best I can come up with is that they\u2019re, like, a fine balance between comedy and drama. And they deal mainly with the clumsiness of humanity.\u201d Well, that\u2019s definitely true of Tinnyvision. As evidenced by his decision to set Ragnarok outside the Marvel universe \u2013 a ballsy move, given the size of the fandom and budget in question \u2013 Waititi is one to do things his own way. And it\u2019s paying off. Hunt for the Wilderpeople reportedly made as much as US$23m worldwide (with takings of more than $8m in its home country) and spent some eight weeks in the top 10 at the Australian box office. It placed among the top 100 films of all time on Rotten Tomatoes, where it is 97% \u201ccertified fresh\u201d from 171 reviews, and was the New York Times and LA Times\u2019 critics\u2019 pick, as well as Empire magazine\u2019s film of the year. \u201cI knew it would play well with audiences, I just didn\u2019t know if anybody would have any idea how to market it or sell it or get people in cinemas to see it ... It\u2019s not like [New Zealand is] known for churning out really big blockbusters every year.\u201d At home, Waititi has gone from hit to bigger hit. His first feature film, the oddball romantic comedy Eagle vs Shark, was nominated for the grand jury prize at the Sundance film festival in 2007 \u2013 as was his second, Boy, in 2010. He may not be quite as big a celebrity as his long-time collaborator Clement, with whom he won New Zealand\u2019s top comedy award as the Humourbeasts in 1999, but he\u2019s close. And when Hunt for the Wilderpeople became the highest-grossing local film at the New Zealand box office in May last year, it broke Boy\u2019s record. (At the time, Waititi called it \u201cthe happiest and saddest day of my career\u201d.) In late February, Waititi was named the New Zealander of the year. I ask where the honour ranks in among nominations at the Academy Awards and Sundance and wins at festivals in Berlin, Edinburgh, Hawaii, Melbourne, Taipei, Toronto and Warsaw. \u201cIt\u2019s up there,\u201d he answers. \u201cThere are a lot of nominations for things I never won and this is something I actually did win \u2013 it feels like I\u2019ve followed through on this one.\u201d Waititi\u2019s Academy Award nomination came in 2005 \u2013 before any of his feature films \u2013 for his 11-minute short Two Cars, One Night. He infamously pretended to be asleep during the ceremony. That outsider\u2019s mentality has persisted, despite the successes of the interim 12 years. The best picture fiasco of this year\u2019s Academy Awards was \u201cgreat\u201d, he says. \u201cI loved it. I thought it was hilarious ... They take this stuff so seriously, don\u2019t they? It\u2019s almost like launching a rocket into space.\u201d Keeping a home far away from Hollywood has been grounding for Waititi; it\u2019s hard to get caught up in all the glitz and self-importance from New Zealand, where he and his family are based. He has two daughters, aged four and one, and a stepson with his wife, the producer Chelsea Winstanley. But another way to look at his geographical distance is as a buffer, or a safety net. You can always go home again \u2013 and why wouldn\u2019t you, when you\u2019re already a massive success there? \u201cHaving had pretty much four successful films at home, I know there\u2019s an audience for my work,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people are trying to get out of their home country and think \u2018making it\u2019 is if you\u2019re able to work in another. For me ... I\u2019d be quite content to keep doing my own little films down there for the rest of my filmmaking career.\u201d The New Zealand Film Commission will be glad to hear that, I say. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said it,\u201d he replies. That may all change, with Thor: Ragnarok set to be by far the biggest commercial success of his career to date. (Thor: The Dark World made $644m worldwide in November 2013.) With Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Wilderpeople star Sam Neill joining Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo, anticipation is high for the third instalment of the franchise \u2013 not least because Waititi, with his background in indie comedies, was such an unusual pick. The day we speak, the first stills from the film have been released, with Blanchett, Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson in character on the cover of Entertainment Weekly. Social media is delighted with Goldblum\u2019s turquoise eyeliner (\u201cIf the new Thor film is nothing but Goldblum sitting silently looking like this, then I will still see it six times,\u201d says one tweeter) but mixed on Hemsworth\u2019s short hair. Waititi is unfazed: \u201cCrazier things happen to Thor than new hair.\u201d His apparent lack of reverence for the Marvel universe \u2013 illustrated in part by the mockumentary-style teasers that have been released in the film\u2019s lead-up \u2013 led Forbes to call Ragnarok the studio\u2019s \u201cwild card\u201d for 2017; others have taken it as a vote of confidence in Waititi\u2019s pitch. \u201cWhy am I excited for Thor: Ragnarok?\u201d wrote film critic Sarah Marrs. \u201cBecause Taika Waititi talked Marvel into overhauling an entire franchise, AND THEY LET HIM.\u201d Waititi says. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that I wanted to make a Marvel film ... I just want to make sure I\u2019m not making an episode.\u201d With the film due out in November, he will be based in Los Angeles until the end of the year. For the first time ever in his career, he has an office, he says. The challenge seems to be battling against his short attention span. \u201cWith Thor, I\u2019m trying not to do any other things. ... There\u2019d be nothing worse than the film not being as good as I think it\u2019s going to be because I didn\u2019t spend enough time on it. I don\u2019t want my focus pulled away, as it usually is.\u201d Still, he admits he\u2019s starting to make plans for life after Ragnarok, considering which of four of his own scripts to tackle next \u2013 \u201csomething super-fast and a bit more carefree\u201d. A werewolf spin-off of What We Do In The Shadows and the stop-motion animation Bubbles, about Michael Jackson\u2019s pet chimp, are also on the cards. Waititi likens his approach to filmmaking to a buffet. \u201cI want to try every little every thing from either end. I don\u2019t want to go straight to the chicken. I\u2019ll put some grapes on the plate, a bit of gravy and mix it all up.\u201d But that analogy \u2013 the mixing of the grapes with the gravy \u2013 suggests an indiscriminate approach, when Waititi is picky about what projects he takes on \u2013 particularly when others\u2019 ideas tend to interest him less than his own. Ragnarok was not the first big-budget Hollywood script he\u2019d been sent, he says \u2013 it was simply the first he\u2019d felt moved to take up. Waititi wrote the first script of the Disney animation Moana before opting in 2012 to return to New Zealand to make What We Do In The Shadows. He\u2019d just had a child. \u201cI basically didn\u2019t want to be living here, working in an office, writing someone else\u2019s movie,\u201d he says. All that remains of his original script is \u201cEXT: OCEAN \u2013 DAY\u201d, he jokes. But the final product was \u201cgood\u201d. \u201cI was relieved it was not insulting to Pacific cultures. That was a big worry for me. I was very nervous about it. You often ask yourself, \u2018Oh my god, do I get involved with something like this?\u2019\u201d Waititi is half-M\u0101ori himself and much of his work is steeped in New Zealand\u2019s indigenous culture, celebrating that which makes it unique \u2013 particularly its humour \u2013 while not shying away from the challenges it faces. (His attention goes beyond simple representation: he said hiring Indigenous people to work on Thor was his \u201cresponsibility\u201d as a filmmaker.) Boy, set in the remote coastal village where Waititi grew up, revels in the comedy and joy to be found in the midst of poverty. He told NPR that part of its appeal was that it did not perpetuate stereotypes: \u201cIndigenous people in films, it\u2019s all like nose flutes and panpipes and, you know, people talking to ghosts ... which I hate.\u201d These considerations were front of mind when he was approach for Moana. \u201cI thought, well, the best way of them not making something that\u2019s insensitive or shallow was to involve people from that community, from the Pacific ... If there\u2019s some way I could be at the table and help try and make this not a bad film, then I\u2019ll try.\u201d His involvement ended with the first draft. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything to do with the process, I just got b\u2013\u201d. He stops short of saying \u201cbored\u201d but not quite short enough. \u201cLike I do all the time, I just ended up wanting to do my own thing again and make a vampire movie instead.\u201d Waititi\u2019s script \u2013 focusing more on Moana\u2019s family relationships \u2013 contributed an irreverent, \u201cvery Pacific humour\u201d to the film, according to producer Osnat Shurer. Shurer also said it gave the filmmakers \u201cpermission to continue down that road, because he\u2019s from that culture\u201d. Waititi thinks they could have taken it further. \u201cI know the danger is they\u2019ve got to be respectful but Pacific islanders and Polynesians have some of the least respectful humour on the planet,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201c[But], as Americans making a film about another culture, and having been criticised in the past for their depictions of minorities, they have to be a bit safer.\u201d At least there\u2019s a Polynesian Disney princess now, I offer? Waititi doesn\u2019t sound convinced: \u201cYeah. I guess so. Yeah. I dunno. Haha! I dunno. Luckily, through the phone, you can\u2019t see my face.\u201d Waititi is not good at censoring himself \u2013 or, at least, not fast enough. He often stops himself short as, I imagine, he pictures his words in print and what doors they might close for him. One he seems happy to shut himself is a future biopic, which he volunteers as \u201cthe worst type of movie\u201d, committing the cardinal sin of being boring. \u201cThey\u2019re always subject to such scrutiny. Like ... \u2018Oh, they really learned to play piano, they went around wearing blue suede shoes for the entire shoot\u2019. \u201cI think, why is that interesting for an actor? Who cares?\u201d The way Waititi hates biopics, I note, is the way many people hate films like the Marvel movies: big blockbuster franchises built on sequels to sequels, held up as the antithesis of the small indie films he\u2019s best known for back home. Is it possible for the two to coexist? \u201cSo far they\u2019re existing well for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that after this I\u2019ll go back and do an independent film. Then I\u2019ll hopefully come back and do another studio thing. I would kind of like to dwell between both worlds.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
