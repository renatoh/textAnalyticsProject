The direct plea from the rank and file of Obama\u2019s own party was made as the White House finalises its plans for a widely anticipated executive order that would provide work permits to almost half of the 11 million people living in the country illegally. Obama has pledged to push ahead with executive action despite trenchant opposition from Republicans who argue their triumph in last week\u2019s midterm elections should force the president to put the brakes on his plans. However in a letter to Obama released on Thursday, 116 House Democrats said it was clear Republican leaders would not pass legislation to enact comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cBy failing to do their job \u2013 and repeatedly interfering with your efforts to do your job \u2013 congressional Republicans threaten to take our immigration system hostage and preserve a status quo that everyone agrees is unacceptable,\u201d the letter said. \u201cTheir failure to act must not inhibit your commitment to governing.\u201d A presidential overhaul of the immigration system will put the White House on a collision course with Republicans, who swept to victory in dozens of key races in the midterm elections, enabling the GOP to retake control of the Senate from January. The Republican speaker of the House, John Boehner, warned Obama earlier this week he would be \u201cinviting big trouble\u201d by using his presidential authority to reform the immigration system, setting the scene for the first major collision between the parties after the midterm elections. But the presidential order, which is expected to build on a 2012 measure that protected young people brought to the country illegally as children, will be a huge victory for Latino and immigration rights groups and liberals in his party. One senior Democratic source told the Guardian that Obama was expected to make his move after the 6 December Senate election runoff in Louisiana, a state likely to react badly to any move by Democrats to shield undocumented workers from deportation. Details of the proposed executive order remain thin. Two reports \u2013 by the New York Times and Fox News, both of which cited administration officials with knowledge of a draft plan \u2013 said the president was considering expand the deferred action order which mandated immigration authorities to suspend deportations of young people brought to the country illegally. The deferred action against childhood arrivals (DACA) order, which looks set to broaden to make a larger group of people eligible, also gave applicants work permits. Crucially, both reports said Obama would also order immigration authorities to suspend deportations of parents of US citizens and legal residents, a measure that could benefit some 3.3 million undocumented migrants living in the country illegally. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports but administration officials have in recent days sounded bullish about the president\u2019s intention to pursue the executive action, which was postponed until after the midterm elections, despite Republican opposition. Obama\u2019s chief press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with the president in Burma on Thursday that no final decision had been taken about what would be contained in the order. However, he indicated a decision would be taken soon after Obama returns from his trip to Asia. Both reports said the order would be signed next week. Earlier on Thursday, Illinois congressman Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, a leader of the pro-reform movement, told reporters: \u201cI am here with dozens of Democrats and what we want the president to do is to act boldly, act swiftly, and act generously. We want millions of Americans to know that their Thanksgiving is not going to be interrupted by an immigration agent.\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez insisted he had not got any inside track on what the White House was or was not planning, despite media reports that action was imminent. \u201cI have not heard what the New York Times and Fox News think what they have heard about what the president might be going to do,\u201d he said. But several of those present, who are known to be close to the White House, spoke in the past tense about the decision and began preparing the arguments against possible recriminations and drawing parallels with the civil rights struggle. \u201cAfter the president exercises his broad authority to defer removals, we will hear complaints that he acted outside the law,\u201d said Michigan representative John Conyers, a senior member of the judiciary committee. \u201cBut like those before him, president Obama\u2019s legal authority to act derives from the constitution and the immigration and nationality act itself. The only path forward at this time is through executive action.\u201d Zoe Lofgren of California added: \u201cMany of our Republican colleagues say president doesn\u2019t have authority or will poison the well if he does this; well they are wrong.\u201d \u201cThe president can\u2019t just wait,\u201d she said, claiming the the chance of a Republican Congress passing its own immigration bill was an \u201cunlikely proposition\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
