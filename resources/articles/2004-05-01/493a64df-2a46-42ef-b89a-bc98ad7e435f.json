I don't want to find myself being asked on our pre-season tour of America about players coming in. I hope they're in place by then.\" In place maybe, but Larsson in particular appears virtually irreplaceable. Just when you were thinking there was nothing left for the striker to achieve with the Parkhead club, he turned up with two goals that transformed the Scottish Cup final. \"He's a magician,\" added O'Neill. \"I have played with a lot of great players including George Best when he was in the twilight of his career and Henrik is right up there.\" His brace, plus a late third from Stilian Petrov, allowed Celtic to complete the Premier League and Scottish Cup double as they bounced back from Andrius Skerla's first-half opening goal for Dunfermline. Fans are in tears at the prospect of Larsson's departure after his Farewell Fiesta against Seville tomorrow night, he himself is unusually emotional, newspapers have been producing 16-page pull-outs, and O'Neill was even asked if Celtic would be retiring the No7 jersey previously worn by the likes of Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Johnstone. That, it seems, was a bridge too far and the manager declared with a grin: \"They never did that at Nottingham Forest when I left. There are players who would love to wear that number for this football club. It's still there, too, for the younger players here.\" It is finding the right man with both the physical and mental strength to fill Larsson's boots which may still prove to be a problem, but O'Neill has set his sights high and Rivaldo, for one, might be a useful replacement. In the midst of Larsson's farewell tour, though, there is another matter concerning Celtic fans despite another glorious season. That, of course, is the manager's own future. As ever, it is impossible to second-guess O'Neill, who is making all the appropriate noises about signings and planning for next season. Yet in virtually the same sentences he lapses occasionally into reminiscing about his four years in Glasgow as if there's not about to be a fifth. \"It's well-nigh impossible to turn down jobs you've not been offered,\" he declared. \"All the speculation is news to me. \"I have enjoyed my four years at this club. It's been memorable and mostly enjoyable and very intense. I don't think you really know about the intensity until you work here.\" Not that the incessant speculation and pressure appeared to be getting to him on Saturday. \"We deserved to win although I admit to being a bit concerned at half-time when we were a goal down,\" he conceded. At that point Dunfermline had frustrated the favourites and even had the temerity to take the lead through Skerla's looping header which, as his team-mate Derek Young and the goalkeeper David Marshall challenged unsuccessfully for the ball, dropped behind both of them into the goal. Then the game's defining moment went Celtic's way when Bobo Balde handled in the area during a Dunfermline attack only for play to be waved on. Chris Sutton sent Larsson on his way, albeit courtesy of a mistake by young Aaron Labonte, and it was 1-1 instead of 2-0. Larsson, with another classic strike, and Petrov completed the business. \"I only saw the Balde incident on television afterwards,\" admitted the Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood. \"These things happen, and I actually thought their goalkeeper was impeded for our goal, although I took it gladly.\" Dunfermline, too, are now resigned to losing players after the club's flirtation with administration a few months ago. The Scotland striker Stevie Crawford can go as a result of taking a wage cut then, Derek Stillie played his last game for the club at Hampden and Saturday's substitutes Lee Bullen and David Grondin have been released. None, though, will be missed by the Fife club as much as Larsson by Celtic. Man of the Match - Henrik Larsson The script was written for him before a ball was kicked and he delivered it in his usual inimitable style. It was Larsson's grand finale. Best moment A classic turn past the defender Aaron Labonte and shot past Derek Stillie for Celtic's second goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
