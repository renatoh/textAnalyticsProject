I used to hear voices but I thought everyone was and never gave it a second thought. When I was 16 a friend asked me to go with them to a spiritual meeting and when I got there I was completely taken over. People were speaking to dead relatives. I was amazed and suddenly it all clicked into place. For anyone who feels they have a deep sensitivity, San Francisco is the perfect place - it's got masses of energy, is very egalitarian and you can be yourself because no one's going to judge you. I love the diversity of San Francisco, it's bursting with so many different characters and culture. It's a city of extremes with very wealthy areas like Nob Hill and Lombard Street right next to very poor parts of the city. Walk just a few hundred yards you are in a different vibe entirely. San Franciscans are very open-minded and that always helps psychic readings. Water is a great connection for spirits and the Bay acts as a great magnet for psychic vibration. Mooch around the city on foot to get a feel of the place; pick up some great food; then take a tour of Alcatraz. You'd expect a scary energy from the prison but in fact I picked up a sense of anger and frustration. The cells are very eerie. Parts of the city still have a real 70s vibe, you feel a bit of a hippy there. Around Haight is the area to be seen, bustling with hip people. I meditated in the Grace Episcopal Cathedral, a contemporary building that provides a wonderful peaceful oasis in the madness of San Francisco. The city is totally beautiful and the hills are incredible, take a tram whenever you can. You're surrounded by history with the colonial style buildings and crazy colours.
