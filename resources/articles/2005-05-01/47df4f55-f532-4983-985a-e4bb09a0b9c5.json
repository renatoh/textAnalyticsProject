For the second time in three years, the race for the Bank of Scotland Premier league title is going to the wire, with Rangers knowing they must win at Hibernian on Sunday and hope Celtic, two points ahead, slip up at Motherwell. But the season will also be remembered for the heated debate that followed the award of a last-minute penalty for Rangers away to Hearts in March. The Tynecastle club took the unprecedented step of demanding an inquiry into the \"integrity\" of the decision, effectively branding as biased the referee's assistant Andy Davis, who had recommended its award to Hugh Dallas. The Celtic manager Martin O'Neill was also quick to insist his side were never favoured that way but fortune was certainly with him on the same Edinburgh ground on Sunday. With Celtic winning 2-1, the referee Willie Young decided that the Hearts captain Steven Pressley had dived when he went down in the box under a last-minute challenge from Craig Beattie. Had Hearts equalised and gone on to take a point it would have enabled Rangers to go into the final round of fixtures ahead of Celtic on goal difference. It was a hugely important decision, but McLeish refused to condemn Young. Instead he rounded on the conspiracy theorists. \"If you look at the decision we got against Hearts I said at the time that there would be contentious decisions between now and the end of the season,\" he said. \"But Rangers Football Club have been unsurpassed in their dignity of handling these situations. And I think I have been proved correct in that respect. We would never, ever scrutinise the integrity of the officials.\" McLeish has also been keen to talk up his side's on-pitch progress after failing to win a trophy last season. However he knows winning the title is the only achievement that counts as unqualified success in Glasgow and the pressure is on him to overtake Celtic sooner rather than later. The midfielder Barry Ferguson has pleaded for the manager to be given enough time to complete that task but McLeish insisted that only chairman David Murray was qualified to make judgments on his job security. McLeish knows it is likely that his players will have only the CIS Insurance Cup in the cabinet at the end of the season, but with Celtic's squad now ageing and in need of an overhaul, McLeish can hope that his own rebuilding programme, which began last summer and featured significant additions in January, can give him an edge next season. \"I certainly believe we have gone forward because we have got younger legs in the team and we have more potent strikers this season playing consistently together,\" he added. \"But I also know that we are not the finished article. To become the finished article you need millions and that is not going to happen, but we will do our best. As all the Rangers fans know, we have to be as prudent as possible and do the best we can to enhance the level.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
