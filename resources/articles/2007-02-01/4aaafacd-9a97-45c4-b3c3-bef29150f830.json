He tended to take the view that he was the most interesting man in the room. Sometimes he was right. He was a close friend of friends of mine who, some years ago, bought a house in Suffolk. Sherry was one of their first visitors. When they answered the door he was on the step with his arms flung wide, crying \"Welcome! Welcome!\" Three years ago he spoke at a party for the 40th anniversary of Late Night Line-Up, the BBC2 arts programme which was highly esteemed, but known for its very low viewing figures. He was one of the presenters. In 1974, the gay writer and historian James Pope-Hennessy was murdered in bed by some rough trade youth he had picked up. His diaries showed that his last appointment had been for lunch with Sherry that same day. The police asked if he could account for his movements afterwards, so he went through them all, adding (with a little pride, I suspect) that in the evening he had presented a live television arts programme. The whole party erupted when he reported that the policeman had said suspiciously, \"and did anybody see you, sir?\" There is a new annual lecture series, called the Benn Lectures. The inaugural address the other day was by Tony Benn. He was rude about the wealthy men who control the media, and of course he is right. But he added that political writers were, in his view \"embedded\", adding \"journalists are very, very controlled by No 10.\" Would those be the same journalists who have gleefully splashed every detail of the cash for peerages investigation? Who publish articles addressed to Tony Blair saying, \"in the name of God, go!\" Who trawled through the Bernie Ecclestone scandal, to say nothing of the dodgy dossier and the hounding of Dr David Kelly? Who report daily on the polls that chart Tony Blair's dwindling popularity? We went to the fabulous Hogarth exhibition this week, and all I can say is that you should go, even if you live in Inverness. It's overcrowded of course - art exhibitions are the new rock concerts - but you can get round that by taking it in reverse order. There are long lines at the start of the great sequences - The Rake's Progress, and Marriage a la Mode, for example - but if you read the guide you can just as easily start at the end, and nobody will suspect you of queue jumping. As well as being a stupendous satirist, he was also deeply sentimental, as the family portraits show. You'll be familiar with the portrait of the four Graham children, if only because of the family cat gazing hungrily at the caged bird. What I hadn't realised is that the youngest child, little Thomas, who sits on his wheeled chair smiling and holding his big sister's hand, was actually dead when the portrait was painted. But they didn't see any reason why he should be left out, so Hogarth put him in, a figure of Death with his scythe on the clock above his head. It's very touching. We have a family legend or myth that the painter's father, originally a teacher in Westmoreland, was actually called Richard Hoggart, but changed his name when he moved to London because \"Hogarth\" sounded less like some northern peasant. I can't find this in any of the current lives, but it did appear in an ancient leather-bound biography I leafed through in 1989 in, of all places, a B&amp;B in rural Louisiana. It doesn't mean anything. There are many variants on the name, and then they are more or less interchangeable. On the other hand, Richard Hoggart is the name of both my father and my son, and knowing how obsessive many Cumbrian people are about genealogy, I'd love to hear from anyone who can shed more light. You have sent many letters and emails about maddening things in modern life which we never asked for but are stuck with. Like the way the Tate Britain added a \u00a31.50 fee to our tickets, just for booking online, which ought to be cheaper because it's done by computer. Karl Sabbagh writes in with an enraged, and wholly justifiable, rant about being obliged to pay a parking fee by mobile phone in the West End. It proved to be quite impossible, and the curtain was going up at any minute. The other day we wanted to book a dinner table for seven people a few days in advance. According to the website, if we cancelled less than 36 hours - 36 hours! - before the booking, we would have to pay them \u00a310 a head compensation. Was this some grand restaurant where they could lose a fortune if guests don't turn up? No, it was Chez G\u00e9rard, just another chain brasserie, and when we got there it was half empty. I think I now understand how Britain, once a great manufacturing nation, is holding up its economic head - we are now the greatest rip-off nation. WH Auden, whose 100th anniversary we've been celebrating, came to stay with us once. He was accepting an honorary degree from the University of Birmingham, his home city. It was an extraordinary visit, but two things stood out in my young mind. My parents had people round to meet him. He announced that he would be drinking martinis, and instructed me in his favourite recipe, which consisted of: 1 bottle gin, 1 lemon, sliced, 1 tray of ice cubes and, almost an afterthought, 1 capful of dry vermouth. That lasted him for the party, and he was ready for wine with dinner. His last day was a Sunday and I came downstairs to find the poet tracing the grid from the Observer crossword on to baking paper, so that he could solve it without spoiling it for anyone else. He didn't say much about poetry, but he was very enthusiastic about Kenwood mixers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
