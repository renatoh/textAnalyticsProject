Hundreds of Normandy veterans, blue-blazered, chest-bars weighted with medals, sat before the Cross of Sacrifice at Bayeux military cemetery for a service of remembrance attended by the Prince of Wales and the prime minister, Theresa May, on the 75th anniversary of D-day. Their number is smaller now. Age is defeating them. But as Royal British Legion standards dipped in respect, and the buglers\u2019 last post heralded a two-minute silence broken only by birdsong, they stood, or sat, as straight as their advanced years permitted. Bayeux, the first city to be liberated, is the last resting place of more than 4,100 Commonwealth servicemen. Hundreds of people made clear their gratitude, lining the city\u2019s cobbled streets as veterans made their way to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. May, in one of her final engagements as Conservative party leader, paid tribute to the \u201craw courage\u201d of all who stormed the beaches and fought in the villages, towns and copses during the Battle of Normandy. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, at a ceremony to inaugurate a memorial to the British fallen, highlighted the ties binding France and the UK. \u201cNothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values. The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future,\u201d he said. A tri-service guard of honour and fanfare greeted Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as they arrived at the cemetery with May and her husband, Philip. Frank Baugh, 95, from Doncaster, gave powerful testimony of arriving at Sword beach at H-hour, his words resonating with so many others there. As a Royal Navy signalman with the Landing Craft Infantry, his task was to ferry in 200 troops from Newhaven, he said in an address at the service. As they approached the beach, they took a direct hit which caused a fire and holed the craft below the waterline. Many were injured. The others had to make for the beach. \u201cMy most abiding memory is seeing the boys we had been talking to a minute before cut down by machine gun fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fell into water, floating face down. We couldn\u2019t get them out. We couldn\u2019t help them. And that is my most abiding memory that I can\u2019t forget.\u201d In a pre-recorded interview with the BBC, Prince Charles paid tribute to those who had fallen. \u201cThis country lost countless special people and we owe it to them and their families to go on commemorating this,\u201d he said. Of the veterans, he said: \u201cThey always remember their comrades and their friends and the people they had to leave behind.\u201d The 75th anniversary was particularly poignant. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to these remarkable people who wanted above all to do their duty,\u201d he added. John McOwan, 98, from Peebles, Scotland, who was a sergeant with the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers and landed on Sword beach four days after D-day, said: \u201cThe service was very emotional. The tears were running down my face because it was so touching.\u201c There were ceremonies and services hosted all across the D-day beaches. In the small seaside town of Arromanches, elderly veterans mingled with D-day tourists \u2013 many in replica second world war uniforms, some driving vintage military vehicles \u2013 who packed into the town\u2019s streets. The veterans linked arms to join in with a rendition of We\u2019ll Meet Again. In the town\u2019s small square, overlooking Gold beach and the remnants of the Mulberry harbour, Lewis Trinder, 95, read the Exhortation at a service of remembrance attended by Tobias Ellwood, the minister for defence. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here every year for at least the last 20 years,\u201d said Trinder, from Aldershot, who was an able seaman aboard HMS Magpie. He spent D-day anchored off Gold beach, and remained there for three days \u201cin case something went wrong and we were needed\u201d. \u201cThis is my second home,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows me here. My friends are here. I don\u2019t go to the cemeteries, they\u2019re miserable places. Always Arromanches. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d There were bagpipes, and a flypast by a Dakota and Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial flight. At the end of the service, several veterans paraded through the crowded streets. Many were in wheelchairs. Some lent on carers. Other walked with just a stick. All were determined. Before the cemetery commemorations, more than 1,000 people attended a Royal British Legion remembrance service at Bayeux Cathedral, including the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who described the service as \u201cbeautiful and inclusive\u201d. In a touching tribute, six-year-old George Sayer proudly wore his great-uncle\u2019s war medals to Bayeux war cemetery, and was allowed to join the veterans as they walked the half-mile from the town\u2019s cathedral to cemetery. His great-uncle, also called George Sayer, who was in one of the first landing craft on Sword beach on D-day, had planned to mark the anniversary at Bayeux, but died 18 months ago, aged 93. \u201cUncle George\u2019s son Kerry requested that little George wear his medals,\u201d said little\u2019s George\u2019s grandmother, Pat Sayer. George\u2019s parents, Jo, 46, and Adam, 49, from Chipping Ongar in Essex, watched with other family members as George held hands with veteran Jack Quinn, 95, a former Royal Marine from Lincolnshire. Earlier, May and Macron attended the launch of construction work for the new British Normandy memorial, overlooking Gold beach at Ver-sur-Mer, which will record the names of all 22,442 members of the British armed forces who died in the landings and ensuing battle. \u201cStanding here, as the waves wash quietly on to the shore, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage that it must have taken that day to leap out from landing craft and into the surf \u2013 despite the fury of the battle,\u201d May said, addressing invited guests. It was \u201ctruly humbling\u201d to stand looking across the beaches \u201cwith the men who were there on that day\u201d, she added. \u201cIf one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come \u2013 in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world \u2013 that day was 6 June 1944.\u201d Wreaths were laid at the foundation stone of the memorial, including one by Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s great-great grandson, John Churchill. Depicting three British soldiers storming the beaches, the memorial is expected to be completed within a year. Macron said: \u201cThe British people have long dreamed of this memorial.\u201d He also appeared to pay tribute to May in the last gasps of her premiership. \u201cLeaders may come and go but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
