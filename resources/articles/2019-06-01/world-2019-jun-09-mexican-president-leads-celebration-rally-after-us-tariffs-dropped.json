L\u00f3pez Obrador called the rally, which was convened prior to the tariffs being cancelled, a \u201ccelebration\u201d of both countries brokering a deal. President Trump had threatened to impose 5% tariffs from Monday on all Mexican goods, if Mexico did not agree new measures to stem migration from Central America. At the rally in Tijunana, L\u00f3pez Obrador said: \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating yesterday\u2019s important agreement because it was putting us in a very difficult situation with these tariffs because we would have had to impose the same measures on US products.\u201d \u201cWhat follows? Keeping our commitments: reinforcing our [southern] border, applying the law and respecting the human rights\u201d of migrants. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister and chief negotiator on the tariffs, Marcelo Ebrard, also spoke at the rally: \u201cWe didn\u2019t win everything, but we were able to claim a victory with there being no tariffs.\u201d He added that the country had emerged with its \u201cdignity intact\u201d. Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs would have dented Mexico\u2019s export-driven economy and inflicting additional uncertainty on a slowing economy. L\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly called AMLO, has avoided antagonising Trump \u2013 to the point he flashed the peace sign with both hands when asked to comment Friday on his US counterpart. In his Tijuana speech, AMLO offered anecdotes from past periods of cordial US-Mexico relations, noting that more than a million Americans resided in Mexico and stressed the importance of Mexico as a market for US merchandise. \u201cI\u2019m not raising a closed fist, rather an open and direct hand to President Donald Trump,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. AMLO promised on the campaign trail last year \u201cnot do the dirty work\u201d of any foreign government on the issue of migration. His administration started issuing humanitarian visas to migrants arriving in Mexico, but stopped the process due to crushing demand \u2013 and perceptions migrants were simply using the documents to hasten trips through Mexico to the US border, rather than seeking opportunities in the country. US border officials have detained migrants in numbers not seen in more than a decade, stoking Trump\u2019s ire. In its deal with the US, Mexico promised to send 6,000 members of a newly-formed militarised police to its southern states. It also will accept the expansion of a program known as Remain in Mexico. Under the scheme, those seeking asylum in the US will wait in Mexico for their claims to be processed. Mexico has pledged to provide them with employment programs and social services for those waiting. One AMLO ally, lower house speaker Porfirio Mu\u00f1oz Ledo, called the arrangement with the US, \u201cimmoral and unacceptable, the double standard between the (Mexican) northern and southern border. On the one hand, we demand that they open the doors to us [in the north] and on the other, we seal off the passage of Central Americans to do the US a favour.\u201d AMLO once again promoted plans to pump billions of dollars into Central America to spur development and eradicate the root causes of migration in some of the poorest, most violent and most corrupt countries in the hemisphere \u2013 which are also grappling with the early impact of climate change. Mexico has already increased enforcement ahead of agreeing to do more in its deal with the US. Immigration officials and soldiers recently stopped a caravan barely a day after it crossed the border. It also detained two members of a migrant-rights collective, Pueblo Sin Frontera, which accompanies caravans. The finance ministry also froze the bank accounts of 26 individuals accused of financing caravans. Support for migrants appears to be waning in states such as Chiapas, where caravans were once warmly received, but are now shunned and viewed with suspicion. \u201c[AMLO] doesn\u2019t pay a political price for repressing migrants. And he may gain something of a bonus here and there,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cThey fundamentally do not enjoy support in Mexico.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
