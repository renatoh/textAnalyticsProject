America\u2019s Nasdaq index has closed at a new all-time high, as the 2019 bull market continues its run. The tech-focused Nasdaq index ended today\u2019s truncated session some 7 points higher at 8,952. That\u2019s a new closing high, as the fabled Santa Rally does the business again. That matches London\u2019s FTSE 250, which shimmied to a record high a few hours ago in a pre-Christmas present to shareholders. However the Dow dipped by 0.1%, amid worried about what \u2018Christmas present\u2019 North Korea might be sending America\u2019s way. The big picture is that Wall Street has notched up its best year since 2013, with the Dow up 22% this year and the Nasdaq up a staggering 34%. That\u2019s partly because stocks suffered a ghastly slump a year ago, and have been recovering since. Wall Street traders are now heading off. so we should too. Thanks for reading and commenting, have a lovely festive break, and see you soon. GW Wall Street is looking rather subdued, as traders get their final orders in before Christmas. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 23 points or 0.1% to 28,526, having hit record highs (again) on Monday. It\u2019s a 1pm finish (6pm UK time), so there\u2019s still time for some drama. Perhaps the Santa Rally might make a late appearance, as we saw in London today? Uber\u2019s shares have risen 1.3% following news of Travis Kalanick\u2019s departure from its board. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reckons it will help CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to lift Uber\u2019s fortunes, after posting hefty losses this year. He told clients (via Marketwatch): \u201cGiven the pace of his insider sales and other initiatives he has on the horizon, it makes sense for Uber and Kalanick to go their separate ways at this time as it would be a distraction in our opinion if he remained in the Board room going forward. \u201cMany investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror as the overhang from the lockup has been a lingering cloud over the Uber name over the past few months. Some late news from Uber: Travis Kalanick, co-founder of the ride-sharing company, is quitting its board and sold all shares. Announcing Kalanick\u2019s departure, Uber says he will leave the board on departure from the board will be effective on 31 December 31 (a week today). In a statement, Kalanick says: \u201cAt the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits.\u201d Uber floated on the stock market in May; shares are down 34% each, making it one of the flops of the year. Kalanick\u2019s tenure as CEO ended in June 2017, when he was forced to resign after a damning exposure of Uber\u2019s culture, and claims he had ignored reports of sexual harassment. A quick update: Wall Street opened higher, as the recent stock rally continued to push shares up. But it then faltered, as traders worried about tensions with North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un yesterday caused alarm, when he warned America to expect a\u201cChristmas gift\u201d. Donald Trump has now brushed this aside, telling reporters the United States would \u201cdeal with it very successfully\u201d and that perhaps it would be a \u201cnice present\u201d. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what the surprise is and we\u2019ll deal with it very successfully. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Time for a quick recap, as City traders dash home for Christmas (or possibly to the shops for a last-minute gift). The traditional Santa Rally has lifted stocks across Europe today, on the final session before the Christmas holidays. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index, made up of medium-sized firms, jumped 0.6% to a new all-time peak. It is now firmly on track for its best year since 2013, having rallied strongly since the UK election. There was also a small gain on the blue-chip FTSE 100, which nudged a five-month high (in a very quiet day\u2019s trading). European stocks also struck a new peak (although some were already closed). Analysts cited trade war optimism, and the prospect of more loose monetary policy in 2020, for the revival. 2019 has been a good year for stocks, with some indices up over 20% (recovering from a slump in autumn 2018). The gold price has also pushed higher, hitting a six-week peak today. That may show some investors are taking defensive positions, in case 2020 brings more turbulence (likely, with a US presidential election, and Brexit, on the calendar). Sterling, though, is hovering at its lowest levels in three weeks as traders worry that the UK and EU won\u2019t agree a free trade deal by December 2020. The prospect of a Phase One trade deal between the US and China may have lifted markets this year....but there\u2019s less optimism that a fuller deal will emerge soon. As Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank told clients: \u201cThere are few reasons to believe that optimism about a broader or \u2018Phase 2\u2019 could emerge in the near term.\u201d Fox Business\u2019s Maria Bartiromo points out that trillions of dollars have been added to stock values this year: Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has surged by 25% this year, while the bigger FTSE 100 has gained 13%. That puts the FTSE 250 among the best-performing indices, while the 100 is one of the laggards. Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada has sent this chart over, showing how stock markets around the world have rallied in 2019. Razaqzada sums up the year: At the top of the tree is the Nasdaq 100 and at the bottom is Spain\u2019s Ibex and UK\u2019s FTSE 100 among major global indices. Stocks have rallied across the board in 2019, even if there were turbulences along the way as investors worried over Brexit and the damaging trade war between the US and China, among other things. But as optimism grew that the world\u2019s largest economies were agreeing to a phase one trade deal, stocks pushed higher \u2013 especially in the US. Tepid economic growth in Europe kept the gains in check for indices in this continent. But this lack of economic growth and non-existent inflationary pressures meant investors were confident that the major central banks were not going to exit zero or negative interest rate policy, and QE, any time soon. They therefore saw the higher-yielding equities as one of the most attractive assets again, causing global stock markets to rise sharply. But as the central bank balance sheet grows ever larger, the withdrawal of such liquidity is a major concern that could come back to haunt stocks at some point down the line. The FTSE 100 had a more muted day. It gained just 8 points, to finish at a five-month high of 7632. Lloyds Banking Group ended the day as the top rise, up nearly 2%, with distribution firm Bunzl (1.6%) and chemicals firm Croda (+1.5%) close behind. The UK stock market is now closed until Friday, giving investors a break from trading. But while trading floors will be quiet, the Internet will be fizzling as UK shoppers look for bargains. Analysts predict that more than \u00a31bn will be spent online tomorrow, as the traditional festive sales get underway. Shipping firm Clarkson led the FTSE 250 rally, finishing 3.5% higher. Housebuilder Redrow gained 2.8%, amid hopes that the housing market might pick up next year Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 has closed at an all-time high, as traders down tools for Christmas. The index of medium-sized companies, including many domestic stocks, has closed 137 points higher at 21,981 points. That\u2019s a gain of 0.6% today, lifting the index above the levels struck after this month\u2019s general election. Nearly every sector rallied, led by energy (+1.5%), healthcare (+1.1%) and miners (+1.1%). Trading was undeniably thin, but this still suggests the City is hopeful that this year\u2019s rally will continue into 2020. The FTSE 250 is seen as a better barometer of the UK economy than the bigger FTSE 100 (which contains more multinational firms). Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 also enjoyed a late surge, and was at record levels as it entered the closing auction..... Here\u2019s Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA on the Santa Rally: Markets officially entered holiday as trading volumes remain very thin and as Wall Street prepares to take the rest of the week off. The Santa rally starts today and if it delivers its typical holiday rally, could produce a 1.3% gain over the next seven trading days. This Christmas Eve will not mimic last year, when we saw US stocks collapse with the S&amp;P 500 falling into bear market territory. This holiday period should be rather calm as trade updates appear very constructive as we near the finalization of the phase-one trade deal next month. The reason we won\u2019t see a repeat of last year is because there are no fears of any of the major central banks tightening policy anytime soon. The playbook for 2020 will be for stocks to rise higher as markets firmly believe the Fed will be on hold, credit markets are healthy, the consumer is strong and some of the key headwinds in 2019 are becoming tailwinds. As if by magic, European stock markets are rallying. The Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s largest companies is now up 0.2%, and just hit a new all-time high. Looks like the Santa Rally is real after all, kids! Russia\u2019s stock market is one of the better performers today. The RTS index has risen by 0.3%, or 4 points, to 1,539. Energy giant Gazprom is among the risers, after raising $13bn of funds to build a new gas plant. The rouble is also strengthening, up 0.3% to 62.06 to the US dollar. That\u2019s nearly its best level of the year, boosted by foreign companies buying roubles to pay tax bills. Santa is also giving the Madrid stock market the cold shoulder today. Spain\u2019s IBEX 35 index has dipped by 22 points, or 0.2%, to 9,637 -- one of the few European markets actually open today. France\u2019s CAC is very slightly higher. With an hour\u2019s trading to go, the FTSE 100 is just hanging onto a five-month high. It\u2019s up 6 points at 7630. Distribution firm Bunzl is now the top riser, up 1,7%, with Ocado close behind (now up 1.6%). Sterling isn\u2019t feeling much Christmas cheer today. The pound is hovering at at three-week low against the US dollar today, at $1.293, as traders fear more Brexit turmoil in 2020. That\u2019s quite a decline in the last 10 days. Sterling hit $1.35, its highest since May 2018, when Boris Johnson won the general election. But the prospect of a bruising battle with the EU over a future trade deal is now puling the pound down. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says the market\u2019s post-election hopes turn into apprehension. Many investors supported Sterling in the immediate aftermath of the election, driving it beyond $1.35, in the hope that a comfortable conservative majority would allow for a more constructive stance from Boris Johnson, in relation to the negotiation of a trade deal with the EU and of course the extension of the transition period. However, the current prevailing market sentiment points at fears, that ultimately, come December 31st 2020, we may still be facing the scenario of an abrupt exit from the EU, without a trade deal; this is why the Pound is declining, as a new sense of reality slowly sinks in. China\u2019s stock market had a good day, with the CSI 300 index closing 0.7% higher. Stocks rallied after vice-premier Li Keqiang suggested China\u2019s key interest rates could be cut to stimulate the economy. Beijing\u2019s plan to cut tariffs on 850 products next month also cheered traders. But there\u2019s also anxiety about whether the trade war with America will cool next year. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s Kit Juckes suspects the tensions could rumble on in 2020, as taking a tough line with Beijing could play well with US voters. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Juckes said that unless Donald Trump gets a \u201cfantastic trade deal\u201d, the president will be tempted to \u201ckeep fighting the good fight for the American worker\u201d. Like King Wenceslas trudging through the snow, the FTSE 250 index is marching slowly higher today. The index of medium-size listed companies is up 30 points, or 0.13% at 21,872 today, close to last week\u2019s record high. Heat treatment firm Bodycote is among the risers, after announcing a deal this morning. It has acquired US rival Ellison Surface Technologies for $200m. This will create \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest providers of thermal spray and engineered coating surface technology services to the aerospace industry.\u201d The jump in the gold price shows that investors are trying to preserve capital in case of turbulence next year, says Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM. He writes: Some headlines overnight that North Korea is thinking about developing new weapons may have helped the move, but the real catalyst is likely that portfolio managers are increasing their defensive exposure. After such a strong year, when almost every single asset class was up double digits, this is probably a prudent time to \u2018play some defense\u2019 and hedge your risk heading into 2020, especially with gold prices trading at a minor discount relative to recent months. Online grocery business Ocado is the top riser in London this morning, up 2.5%. It could prove to be one of this year\u2019s Christmas winners, having been bombarded with orders. Last week Ocado\u2019s CEO, Melanie Smith, emailed customers warning that their systems were creaking under the strain. Apparently, Ocado\u2019s website and app had been \u201coverwhelmed by festive shoppers\u201d adding more items to their orders (fortunately for me, the ever-efficient Mrs W had organised our delivery already). Smith recommended editing orders before 6pm, as: Our customers\u2019 love for great food and drink this Christmas is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before. The Santa Rally is a long-established City tradition. The idea is that stocks typically rise during the final few trading days of December, and the start of the New Year. There\u2019s not much sign of it today, though. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up, but just 4 points higher at 7627. That means it could hit a new 5-month closing high at lunchtime today. France\u2019s CAC 40 is equally becalmed, up 2 points at 6,031, while Germany and Italy are closed today. Perhaps traders weren\u2019t good enough this year (surely not?!). Or maybe Santa came early - the Footsie did gain 41 points yesterday in a pre-Christmas rally. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, reckons gold and silver prices could both keep rallying in 2020. He suspects precious metal prices are \u2018breaking out\u2019 of their previous trading range. Partly that\u2019s thanks to central banks - whose loose monetary policy has driven asset prices up. But increased demand, perhaps from China, is another factor. He writes: First and foremost, the negative relationship between gold and the S&amp;P 500 has been broken down over the past few years with both assets moving higher in 2016, 2017 and now 2019, and falling in 2018. Undoubtedly this is, at least in part, because central bank liquidity is finding its way not just in stocks, but other markets too, such as property and gold. Fund managers making profit from their long US equity holdings would be reinvesting in other parts of their portfolios when they rebalance them. This obviously includes safe-haven gold for many money managers. As I have said before, a trade deal between the US and China may be good news for risk assets (and it has), but it is not necessarily bad news for haven gold. After all, rising optimism over a trade deal has helped the yuan strengthen slightly, making gold relatively less expensive in yuan terms. With China being one of if not the largest gold consumer, this implies increased demand from this important market, especially ahead of the Lunar New Year when gift jewellery purchases tend to rise. Gold has actually enjoyed its best year since 2010. Bullion is up 17% since the start of this year, from $1,265/ounce on January 1 to $1,451 today. Many other assets have had a strong 12 months too -- with some stock markets up 20%. But gold\u2019s strength reflects caution about the world economy and geopolitics. As the Wall Street Journal puts it: \u201cThe fact that investors are still holding a decent chunk of gold gives you a good feeling as to how they are literally hedging their bets,\u201d said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street STT 0.28% Global Advisors in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \u201cGold is definitely not looking like a bad place to store some value or have a hedge.\u201d Gold prices have kept climbing in recent weeks even though improving economic data and President Trump\u2019s provisional trade deal with China have pushed U.S. stocks to a series of all-time highs. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes has also risen, from 1.778% at the end of November to 1.934% Monday. Higher bond yields typically make gold, which pays no interest, less attractive for investors to own. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat....but trading volumes will be rather thin today. It\u2019s the final session before the holiday break. Many City workers have knocked off for the holidays, but some hardy souls have still braved the cold and damp. And they\u2019ve pushed the gold price up to its highest level since November, as worries about the trade war resurface. Yesterday China boosted the markets by announcing plans to cut tariffs on 850 products. That cheered some investors, sending Wall Street to a new record high. But there\u2019s still no sign of the fabled Phase One trade deal with the US being signed, let alone a more comprehensive agreement. So, two thousand years after the Christmas Story, wise (or nervous) men and women are putting their faith in gold. This has lifted the price of an ounce of bullion to $1,491 this morning, up $6, to its highest level since early November. As Stephen Innes, strategist at Axitrader puts it: We are still not 100% clear if the \u2018phase one\u2019 deal will go through or not, it has not been signed yet. We then pivot to \u2018phase two\u2019....that suggests you need some gold, because we don\u2019t know what the next phase is all about, how contentious of a deal that is going to be. The US-China trade war has loomed over the financial markets throughout 2018. Bad for growth, but possibly good for Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects? David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The ever evolving trade story has been great for President Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. The achievement of securing phase one of the deal sent US stock markets to record highs, and collecting tariffs has been a nice boost to the governments\u2019 coffers. Farmers in the US can look forward to see demand for their goods increase next year as China has committed to ramp up purchases. The trade story is far from over so Mr Trump can continue the battle next year, and as long as it doesn\u2019t impact US growth, it should play well with voters. The unemployment rate in the US recently fell to a fifty year low, average earnings are conformably above the CPI rate, and the growth achieved in the third-quarter exceeded the second-quarter so the Donald is going into 2020 with a strong score card. The European markets could be as flat as a festive blini (delicious with a dollop of creme fraiche and some smoked salmon) today. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has just opened unchanged at yesterday\u2019s five-month high, as investors wonder what 2020 has in store...
