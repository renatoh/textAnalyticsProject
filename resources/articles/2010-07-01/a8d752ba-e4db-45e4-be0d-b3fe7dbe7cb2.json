Still, there are ways of doing these things, establishing a rapport with those who matter and getting your way. And following a Freedom of Information request to the European commission from Greenpeace, we see that BP knows as much about the schmoozing game as anybody. There's a new official for biofuels at the commission. BP would very much like to get to know him. They need an introduction. No problem. Any chance we might lunch him, senior BP manager Simon Worthington asks of Peter Vis, the head of cabinet to the European commissioner for climate action? Well, it's early days, says Vis. He's away for a bit, and anyway, he's still \"in the learning phase\". No problem, says Worthington. \"I don't want to put any pressure on him \u2013 I know some like meeting with stakeholders and others don't, so please let him know that it's more the connection rather than lobbying; maybe we can help with the learning curve \u2013 I have a lot of material here on biofuels I can share with him.\" And, by the way, says the BP man, \"Let me know if you have an urge for the opera.\" BP, as we know, is a major sponsor of the Royal Opera House, so quite a few at the company probably have the occasional urge for a bit of opera. Nothing wrong with that. Just \"a social comment between colleagues who work together\", BP tells us. But it shows how the wheels turn. \u2022 They turn, for the fortunate few, to good advantage. Thus David Miliband will be pleased that following his speech this week promising to prioritise higher education, Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of 20 leading universities and the former deputy director of Tony Blair's No 10 strategy unit, put out a gushing press release likening everything he said to holy scripture. Doubly pleased that when his lefty rivals Ed Balls and Ed Miliband voiced their thoughts about tuition fees, the influential Russell Group and the former Blairite strategist said not very much at all. \u2022 And who to endorse? Andrew Lansley or Jamie Oliver? The celebrity chef who has been moving heaven and earth to make school dinner more nutritious? Or the health minister who says the drive has largely been a flop? Tough one for us all, especially for businessman Sir Roy Gardner, who runs Compass Group, the school dinner provider most publicly attacked by Jamie Oliver \u2013 and who, in a private capacity, happens to be a \u00a350,000 donor to the Tory party. He may well be torn right now. Who'd be him? \u2022 Still, this is a government daring to be different. And in that vein, tourism minister John Penrose says he plans to go undercover on a tourist bus to \"experience the tour guide's banter, the roadside catering, the customer care and, most of all, try to grab a word with my fellow travellers\". Vital that he remains incognito, he told the staff. \"I can't see anyone recognising you, to be brutally honest,\" an aide replied. Why not make a virtue of it? Anyone who admits to knowing who he is can have a prize. \u2022 Unemployment blights the land and no one understands this better than the London mayor, Boris Johnson. I haven't been able to find work for a year, a sad, disheartened woman told the mayor at his prestigious State of London debate last week. Oh dear, said moderator Nick Ferrari. What have you done before? What qualifications do you have? Well, she said, my last job was at the Spectator, working with Boris. \u2022 Another day, another energy security issue for the nation. Full marks to energy minister Greg Barker for flagging up the threat. Householders should benefit from more home insulation and the government's \"green deal\", he told the Commons. But \"if someone decides, in their newly insulated home, to turn up the dial and hoover in the nude, that will affect the energy bill\". Understand that Her Majesty's government doesn't endorse the practice \u2013 still, ministers are prudent enough to factor it in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
