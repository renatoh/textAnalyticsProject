Signing Bellowhead was an obvious, but shrewd move, especially as they have teamed up with U2 and Coldplay arranger Rupert Christie to make their most commercial album to date. The formula remains the same, with traditional songs reworked with rousing big-band arrangements, and from furious opener Let Her Run to the rock-influenced Greenwood Side, they sound slicker and more confident than ever. And there are surprises. Moon Kittens is an exercise in brooding, surreal folk psychedelia, based on the nursery rhyme We're All in the Dumps, while I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight is a revival of the bittersweet Richard and Linda Thompson classic, recorded for Island in 1974, and now treated to rapid-fire brass backing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
