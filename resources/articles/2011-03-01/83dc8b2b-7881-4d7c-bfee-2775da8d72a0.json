Celtic were comfortable winners as the Glasgow rivals met in the league, a result that prompted a furious dressing-room reaction from McCoist, Rangers' assistant manager. Since then, Rangers have progressed to the last 16 of the Europa League and narrowed the gap on Celtic at the summit of the Scottish Premier League. \"I can't remember being as low as I was after the last game at Celtic Park,\" McCoist said. \"Celtic played well, you have to accept that, but we were very disappointing. It knocks the stuffing out of you but it's like anything else, it's about how quickly you recover. From our point of view we let ourselves down, management included, and we have to do better. \"It has been a good week for us since then so we will go into this game full of optimism and belief.\" McCoist hinted that Rangers had been spurred on by the media reaction to their three-goal defeat on 20 February. He also dismissed the suggestion that it will negatively impact on the mindset of his players this time around. \"I just felt that some of the things said and written after the last Old Firm game were a bit over the top,\" McCoist said. \"I don't think you should be playing for this club if you get intimidated. These are the games you must want to play in. They are fantastic games and the atmosphere is wonderful. There is no room at this football club for being intimidated. Not for anyone.\" Close attention will be focused on whether or not Rangers can atone for their latest defeat to Celtic. The added incentive, of course, relates to one of the teams denying their greatest rivals the possibility of claiming a domestic treble. \"Ibrox was a terrific cup tie,\" said McCoist of the 2-2 draw which triggered this replay. \"Four goals, sending-offs, a lot of excitement, fantastic saves, a great game. \"This gives us an ideal opportunity to go back there [to Celtic Park] and put right a performance we weren't happy with. We spoke on the Monday after the game about it. We have the opportunity to put it right and that's a great thing. \"Do the players have a point to prove? They are the champions \u2013 they have been champions for the past two years, they have won League Cups and Scottish Cups and got to a European final. They have nothing to prove to anybody other than themselves in that they need to put that poor performance behind them.\" Celtic will be without the suspended Joe Ledley and Fraser Forster, with Lukasz Zaluska to deputise for the latter in goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
