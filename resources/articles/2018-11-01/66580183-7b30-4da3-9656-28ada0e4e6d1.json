That\u2019s not cool but it can happen. The intensity they had in the first half. We tried everything. Obviously not clear enough. We had two or three situations where it looked promising but we took the first ball and shot at a bunch of players.\u201d He also bemoans PSG\u2019s gamesmanship. \u201cAgainst sides like that it\u2019s quite difficult to get confidence so we never got 100% into our game. And there were 500,000 interruptions in the second half. We are the fairest team in England if you look at the table but tonight we looked like butchers. They were smart, if you want, and the ref let it happen. You can lose in Paris, of course, it will happen to a lot of teams in the future. But it still feels a bit rubbish. But on 11 December we have a proper final at Anfield.\u201d He also expresses his disbelief that Verratti was not sent off for his first-half lunge at Gomez, which only brought a yellow. Here\u2019s what Jordan Henderson made of that: \u201cWe are disappointed. We thought we were good enough to come here and win. It wasn\u2019t our night but we kept going until the end .... Now we\u2019ve just got to keep it in our own hands by winning at Anfield .. We didn\u2019t start particularly well and they started quickly, which they knew they would, so that\u2019s disappointing. But the reaction was good. We kept fighting right till the end and caused them problems.\u201d Not many problems, though, not many at all. For the second time in two nights, one of the top two teams in the Premier League has struggled to match the intensity of a side from the much-maligned Ligue 1. PSG have deservedly prevailed, thanks mainly to a first-half performance i which they were too nimble and fast for Liverpool, who never showed enough quality to get back into the game. It was another sorry away performance by Klopp\u2019s side. They could save themselves by beating Napoli by 1-0 or by two goals or more at Anfield in their last game. They\u2019ll have to play a lot better than this to do so. 90+6 min: Keita booked. Not sure why but Dani Alves is rolling around. PSG fans, meanwhile, are singing and dancing. 90+5 min: Liverpool pump it long into the mixer. Van Dijk tries to take it down in the box and shoot, but he\u2019s no Fellaini. 90+4 min: Neymar booked for a sneaky foul. 90+3 min: Neymar flips the ball over Shaqiri with a sumptuous piece of skill but the Swiss wins it back, much to Neymar\u2019s annoyance. But all the pay is down Liverpool\u2019s end and he\u2019ll be pleased with that, at least. 90+3 min: Robertson booked for whacking Neymar with a reckless kick. 90+2 min: There will be at least three more minutes... 90+2 min: Van Dijk slides late to earn a yellow card. 90 min: Shaqiri clips the freekick towards Lovren but the whistle goes because Silva fell over in the vicinity of Van Dijk. 89 min: PSG fold into their defensive formation, challenging Liverpool to open them up. Salah tries to wriggle around Kimpembe and is pulled down. Freekick to Liverpool about 25 yards out. Where\u2019s Alexander-Arnold? Oh. 87 min: Gomes pulls back Neymar, who looks in disgust as the referee as if to ask how much more of this he has to put up with. All he gets is a freekick. 86 min: Silva and Marquinhos conspire to nick the ball off Salah as he goes on a run down the left. Then the jubilant Brazilians bump and roar chests in celebration. PSG substitution: Rabiot on, Mbapp\u00e9 off. Rabiot is booed by some home fans, probably because he has announced he will leave in the summer, having threatened to do so many times before. 84 min: Mbapp\u00e9 threatens to score on the counter but Robertson lunges in to deflect the shot over for a corner. And Sturridge is booked for pulling Verratti back earlier in the move in an attempt to abort it. The ref waved play on but didn\u2019t forget. 83 min: Shaqiri\u2019s freekick is delivered towards Gomez at the back post but Kehrer nods it out for a corner. Before Shaqiri takes it the ref lectures Verratti and Gomez about argy-bargy in the box. Then the corner is taken .. and cleared. 82 min: Freekick to Liverpool in a useful crossing position after Neymar clips the heels of Man\u00e9. 81 min: Neymar feints and dashes past Gomez at the left-hand corner of the Liverpool box. Van Dijk hurries across and slides in to stop the Brazilian. PSG howl for a penalty, but the ref points to the ball, signifying that that\u2019s what Van Dijk touched. 80 min: Factoid: Tuchel managed a team to victory once in 13 matches against Klopp side before today (when Mainz beat Dortmund in 2010). 78 min: A good burst by Keita yields a corner for Liverpool. Shaqiri takes it - his first touch - but it\u2019s headed away. Liverpool substitution: Shaqiri on, Milner off 76 min: Keita turns Verratti inside out near halfway and then gets pulled back by the Italian. That\u2019s the best hing Keita has done since he\u2019s come on. 74 min: Shaqiri is warming up at last. 72 min: Another break in play as another PSG player demands treatment/a rest. It will be interesting to see how many minutes the ref adds on at the end. 70 min: Liverpool have improved slightly in the second half but PSG have dwindled more. They haven\u2019t been able to keep up their first-half intensity and have become sloppy and a little ragged. So although Liverpool haven\u2019t shown much creativity, there\u2019s still a chance they could turn this score around. Liverpool substitution: Sturridge on, Firmino off 69 min: Neymar rolls a corner short to Dani Alves. Man\u00e9 breaks it up. But PSG win another one. This time Neymar delivers a lovely ball towards the penalty spot. Marquinhos rises majestically and beats Lovren to it to power a downward header towards goal. Allison reacts smartly to push it away. 67 min: Lovren goes long for Salah. Too long. Liverpool substitution: Keita on, Wijnaldum off. PSG substitutions: Choupo-Moting and Dani Alves on, Cavani and Di Maria off 65 min: Another errant pass by PSG, who\u2019ve deteriorated significantly in the last 15 minutes. 63 min: Milner, who has been everywhere joins in a purposeful Liverpool move. But his attempt to split open the defence with a low ball to Man\u00e9 fails as Kehrer intercepts. 61 min: PSG are perpetrating an indecent number of niggly fouls. The ref hasn\u2019t been particularly effective at dissuading them. 60 min: Man\u00e9 nicks the ball off Verratti in midfield. Liverpool rumble forward. Robertson curls a cross from the left towards Firmino but he can\u2019t guide his header on target from 15 yards. 57 min: Kimpembe is almost caught idling at the back again. After dispossessing Salah he turned straight into Firmino. But he recovered in time to clear. This is a decent spell for Liverpool, as PSG look a little creaky. 56 min: A superb tackle by Silva to cut out a cross by Robertson, who had got forward down the left for the first time after some fine work by Man\u00e9 and Milner. 55 min: Liverpool win the ball in PSG\u2019s half. Salah shoves a pass through to Man\u00e9, who goes down under contact from Silva. But it was a fair shoulder challenge. Liverpool have to make do with a corner. Silva clears that, too. 53 min: After Neymar turns easily past Salah, the Brazilian unloads a curling shot from 25 yards. 52 min: Liverpool try to cobble together a piercing move as PSG sit back in their own half. But there\u2019s no sign of ingenuity from the visitors. 49 min: A hint of an opening for Liverpool after Wijnaldum spanks a low pass from the left to Milner on the right. Milner tris to slide it towards Fimrino in the box. But Silva cuts it over. 48 min: Di Maria curls over a freekick from the left. Marquinhos pokes it into the net ... but he\u2019s offside! 47 min: Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9 try to conjure something again down Liverpool\u2019s right but have to make do with a foul after Mbapp\u00e9 is brought down. 46 min: The same lineups are back out for the second half, surprisingly. Klopp is evidently hoping a team-talk will do more to improve his side than an injection of a new player or two could. In this group\u2019s other match, Napoli are leading 2-0 at home to Red Star. If the Italians win that and Liverpool don\u2019t win here, Klopp\u2019s side will need to beat Napoli by at least two goals in their last group game. That would enable them to qualify despite losing all three of their away matches. Milner\u2019s penalty just before the break makes for a very interesting second period. PSG were far superior for most of the first - faster, sharper, more skilful - but a ludicrous tackle by Di Maria following a fine burst by Man\u00e9 enabled Liverpool to cut the deficit. But they\u2019ll need to do much more to get a point or more from this game. Shaqiri is needed, for a start. Milner sends Buffon the wrong way and the ball into the corner. Perfect spotkick. Is that the springboard for an unlikely second-half fightback? 44 min: Man\u00e9 wins the ball in midfield and skips past two before being brought down by a wild tackle in the box by Di Maria. Tee ref points for a corner but then, under intense lobbying by Liverpool players and intervention from one of the assistants, points to the spot! 43 min: Henderson tries to tuck a nice ball over the top and into the path of Salah. It\u2019s a good effort but Buffon rushes out to prevent Salah from getting on the end of it. 42 min: Robertson is penalised for tapping the ankle of Di Maria. At least he was in the opposing half - he\u2019s barely been there all game so far; PSG have neutralised the threat of his bursts down that flank. 40 min: Kimpembe plays a loose pass from the back straight to Henderson, who sends a cross ... out of play. \u201cEvery time I see a match played at the Parc des Princes, the little boy in me is traumatised by the outright robbery of Leeds there in the 1975 European Cup Final,\u201d wails Justin Kavanagh. \u201cAnd to make it worse tonight, the teams are wearing all-red and all-white strips\u2026aaaagh, I can\u2019t watch!\u201d 38 min: Liverpool are in serious bother now because PSG have them exactly where they want them. They\u2019re effectively playing Liverpool at their own game, allowing them to have the ball around half-way and then nicking it off them and tearing forward. And one of the reasons that they\u2019re happy to let Liverpool have the ball, you suspect, is because they know Liverpool don\u2019t have enough creative players to make much use of it against an entrenched defence. Shaqiri has been missed. That\u2019s a beautiful goal! Liverpool were torn asunder by PSG\u2019s speed and precision on the break. Mbapp\u00e9 began it in his own half, then swapped passes with Neymar and raced down the left. He crossed low for Cavani. Allison did well to parry the striker\u2019s first-time shot from close range, but Neymar followed up to place the ball into the corner of the net from five yards. 33 min: Neymar robs Gomez near half-way and then gets pulled back. Gomez, unlike Bernat a moment ago, gets booked. 31 min: Neymar cuts through midfield, leaving Henderson panting in his wake. Then he plays a dinky one-two with Cavani and feeds it wide to Mbapp\u00e9 and darts into box in anticipation of the return. Mbapp\u00e9 tries to provide it, zipping a low ball across the face of goal. Allisson pounces on it just before Cavani. 29 min: Good move by Livrepool, involving Gomez, Salah and Milner before Milner chips over a cross from the right byline. It\u2019s beyond the post so Firmino heads it back across goal, but no one is there to profit. 28 min: Bernat tugs back Salah after getting turned mid-way inside his own half. No booking, where they certainly should have been. Those small, very destructive fouls are a true scourge on football. 26 min: Gomez\u2019s long throws-ins from the right have been Liverpool\u2019s best source of danger so far. But PSG have scrambled each of them away so far. Maybe what Liverpool need is a Fellaini-type figure ... 24 min: Verratti booked for lunging into a tackle after letting the ball run away from him. it was probably frustration more than malice but he caught Gomez studs-first above the ankle. Gomez decides not to make a fuss and the ref opts for leniency. 22 min: Kimpembe tries to waltz out of his own area under pressure. He\u2019s caught. Milner pulls the ball back from the byline to Salah. The Egyptian sizes up the shot and then dabs a weak effort into the sidenetting from 12 yards. 21 min: Van Dijk sprays a diagonal ball wide to Gomez, who takes it nicely on his chest and helps it on to Milner. But the ensuing cross is too long. 19 min: PSG are sharper and faster all over the pitch. Liverpool are giving away a lot of freekicks as they try to keep up. 18 min: Neymar is on song. He nutmegs Henderson with a backheeled pass, and then Wijnaldum gets a booking for clumping into Mbappe. 17 min: Man\u00e9 clips over a cross from the left but Salah can\u2019t get on the end of it. 15 min: Tuchel gets a telling off from the ref for protesting about a freekick being awarded to Liverpool. He\u2019s not exactly cowed - instead he roars in the face of the referee, who retreats. Liverpool are punished for their sluggishness. PSG moved through their midfield too easily before Verratti played in Mbapp\u00e9. He tried to wriggle past two in the box before crossing. It was cut out but breaks to Bernat, who took it in his stride and then wrongfooted Allison with a low shot from 10 yards. 11 min: PSG are beginning to dominate possession. And they\u2019re playing with a good tempo. They work it crisply forward to Neymar, whose shotfrom 20 yards lacks power. 9 min: Di Maria is down appealing for treatment after a clunking challenge from Milner, who won the ball and barged the player over. A dead leg for the Argentinian, most probably. 8 min: Kehrer, at right-back, is looking very sharp for PSG, posing real danger going forward. 7 min: Foxy play on the left between Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9, who chests the ball into the path of Di Maria, who has a pop with a dipping half-volley from just outside the right-hand corner of the box. Allisson pushes it away. He should have caught it really. 6 min: Corner to Liverpool after Silva scrambles the ball behind to prevent Salah getting on the end of a backheeled pass from Firmino. Salah\u2019s delivery is uncharacteristically rubbish. 4 min: Verratti takes a quick freekick to Di Maria, who slips in Mbappe. He lets fly on the run from outside the area but Van Dijk gets enough of a touch to deflect it wide. 3 min: Man\u00e9 goes on a run down the left after being found by Van Dijk. He tries to dribble between two near the byline and goes down appealing for a freekick. No dice. 1 min: PSG v Liverpool is go! The home side get it going and have an opening within seconds! Happily for Liverpool, Cavani failed to control a lofted pass over the top. If he had done, he would have had a clear run on goal from the edge of the box. Here comes the teams. There\u2019s a rollicking atmosphere in the Parc des Princes, where PSG are wearing an all white kit because of some marketing nonsense. Liverpool are in all red. \u201cPSG enjoy time and space against weaker opposition,\u201d discloses Aaron Alexander. \u201cThey won\u2019t get that tonight. Klopp is using the Corporal Jones midfield - they don\u2019t like it up \u2018em!\u201d The trio should have more savoir-faire in midfield than Marquinhos, at least. He tends to lose his bearings in there at times. Here\u2019s Elliot Wilson, who begins by recalling a quote about Tommy Smith: \u2018Tommy Smith wasn\u2019t born, he was quarried,\u201d quotes Elliot, who adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to over-emphasise a professional athlete\u2019s intrinsic physical abilities these days (after all, what you\u2019re born with, you have) but I do feel James Milner has a good claim to Tommy\u2019s crown.\u201d He says he has told his team to be brave, by which he means: \u201cBe there. Be positive. Be aggressive in a very legal way. Be ready to block whatever they want to do. Be ready to be cheeky. All that stuff. That\u2019s what you do if you are brave.\u201d About the choice of Gomez ahead of Alexander-Arnold, he explains: \u201cTrent played brilliant in the first game against PSG [so] it\u2019s just about using the fresh legs of Joe. For sure he is slightly more a defender, which maybe makes sense against these boys. It will be interesting.\u201d \u201cMust admit that Liverpool lineup has me a bit worried,\u201d confesses Jake Lynch. \u201cPlan seems to be to contain the home side. Maybe Klopp will do as Zidane did last season in the Bernebeu, and throw on attacking weapons in the second half? As Asensio and Vazquez made the difference then, when they joined from the subs\u2019 bench, maybe Shaqiri and Sturridge will tonight?\u201d \u201cI believe that Liverpool will beat PSG 3-2 once more,\u201d announces Frank Muscat. \u201cI expect Liverpool to let PSG attack and play on the counter after taking the lead early in the game.\u201d That\u2019s certainly possible. And I fancy you\u2019re definitely right about this being a high-scoring affair. Klopp has decided to omit Alexander-Arnold and entrust the right side of Liverpool\u2019s defence to Gomez, leaving Van Dijk to partner Lovren in the centre. Evidently he believes that Gomez, a more accomplished defender, will fare better than Alexander-Arnold against Neymar, in particular. In midfield Klopp has plumped for tried and tested despite slack recent form from Henderson, in particular. You\u2019ve got to think that in time Fabinho, Shaqiri and Keita will form the first-choice trio but today they all start on the bench. For PSG, meanwhile, Mbapp\u00e9 and Neymar return from injury and Marquinhos, a centreback by trade, will aim to hold midfield while Di Maria will strive to do what Shaqiri might have done for Liverpool. Bernat, at left-back, is a weakness that Liverpool will probably seek to exploit. There were rumours in Paris that Rabiot had been left out of the squad entirely after rowing with manager Tuchel this afternoon but PSG have put him on the team sheet. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019s actually in the dugout. It couldn\u2019t be that internet gossip was bogus, could it? PSG: Buffon; Kehrer, Silva, Kimpembe, Bernat; Verratti, Marquinhos, Di Maria; Mbapp\u00e9, Cavani, Neymar Subs: Areola, Dani Alves, Draxler, Rabiot, Diany, Nsoki, Choupo-Moting Liverpool: Alisson; Gomez, Van Dijk, Lovren, Robertson; Milner, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Man\u00e9, Firmino, Salah Subs: Mignolet, Fabinho, Keita, Shaqiri, Matip, Alexander-Arnold, Sturridge Referee: S Marciniak (Poland) What a showdown we have in store here! With each side boasting some of the best players in the world, both fancy their chances of being crowned European champions this season - and yet one of them could fall at the group stages. How embarrassing that would be, especially for today\u2019s host! This duel is do-or-die for PSG and almost as decisive for Liverpool. Let\u2019s start with the permutations: A Liverpool win here combined with a Napoli victory at home to Red Star Belgrade (which kicks off at the same time today) would send J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men through to the knockout stages and eliminate PSG, triggering a mass outpouring of laughter from anyone who doesn\u2019t like the way the Qatari puppet club operates. A PSG win would put the French side in an excellent position and leave Klopp\u2019s team having to trounce Napoli in their final match or hope PSG slip up at Red Star. A draw here combined with a Napoli win would mean Liverpool would progress by gaining a better result in their last match than PSG get in theirs. The Italians may have already qualified by then, depending on the outcome of today\u2019s game against Red Star. In short, this is a high-stakes meeting, a humungous test for both teams and an opportunity for the rest of us to assess their pedigree. It should be a bona fide belter. Mind you, Liverpool will lose if they play as badly as they have done in their most recent European away matches. And they can\u2019t rely on PSG being as disjointed as they were when Liverpool won 3-2 at Anfield. Because Tomas Tuchel\u2019s side have generally improved since then, playing with more intensity and actual cohesion, in Ligue 1 at least. PSG haven\u2019t lost a group match at the Parc des Princes since 2004, although they needed a last-minute equaliser to avoid defeat by Napoli last month (that match, incidentally, came a couple of weeks after they inflicted a 5-0 battering here on Lyon, who\u2019ve give Manchester City the run-around twice this season). Klopp\u2019s approach is going to be intriguing: knowing that PSG must win, he has a choice between (a) embracing an open game and hoping his lads land more blows than Mbapp\u00e9, Neymar, Cavani &amp; Co. and (b) Trying to absorb home pressure and striking on the counter, where Liverpool can definitely do damage. Let\u2019s be having you!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
