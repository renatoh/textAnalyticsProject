Now the brothers are to be thrown together on screen in a Channel 4 docudrama from the makers of the satirical romp When Boris Met Dave. The drama, with the working title Miliband of Brothers, is to be broadcast on Channel 4 digital network More4 on the eve of the announcement of the winner of the Labour leadership ballot at the Labour party conference on 25 September. Real life brothers Henry (David) and Ben Lloyd-Thomas (Ed) will portray the Milibands. David, the former foreign secretary, remains the bookies' favourite to win the ballot, with the support of more than half the shadow cabinet, although there is speculation that the contest will be so close it could be decided by the second and third preferences of party members. Ed, who was climate change secretary in the last cabinet, is regarded as the slightly more leftwing candidate and has won the support of Labour traditionalists including Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. Both have studiously attempted to avoid mud-slinging in the contest, although things have got more pointed and personal in recent weeks. Miliband of Brothers has been written by journalist and broadcaster David Quantick, whose credits include Brass Eye and Harry Hill's TV Burp. It is being made by Blink Films, the independent producer behind last year's When Boris Met Dave, the More4 docudrama about Boris Johnson and David Cameron's Eton years. Like When Boris Met Dave, the 60-minute programme will feature dramatised scenes mixed with archive footage and interviews with people who knew and influenced the brothers at school and university, along with Labour figures including Kinnock, Tony Benn and Oona King."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
