In United\u2019s most recent match they came from 2-0 behind at half-time to win 3-2 against Newcastle. Last season they did the same at Manchester City. Mourinho, asked whether this was what the team required to go on the front foot, said: \u201cNo. We try [to do this from the start]. The key is for the players to be able to do it. That story of the attacking football I still don\u2019t understand because for me you can only play attacking football when you have the ball. You need the ball \u2013 when the opposition has the ball you have to defend.\u201d He emphasised that when United have possession he would like them to attack. \u201cThat is what I want. When the opponent has the ball, I want the ball \u2026 When you have the ball you can play a different way and normally adapted to the qualities of your players.\u201d United are at Chelsea on Saturday and come up against Eden Hazard, who said this week he would like to play for Mourinho again after doing so at Stamford Bridge for two years from 2013-15. Mourinho returned the compliment. \u201cI would love to have him in Manchester United,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Chelsea will sell him. Chelsea is led by intelligent and experienced people in football and they would never sell Eden to Man United so it\u2019s a non-point to comment. \u201cHe is a nice kid. We had a good relation, we were champions together [in 2014-15] and he was for the first time the best player in the league with me. I think the feelings are good so you say nice things, [and] when feelings are not good you don\u2019t say so much nice things.\u201d Paul Scholes again criticised United this week but Mourinho said he had not queried whether his players were upset with the club\u2019s former midfielder. \u201cYou have to ask them because I don\u2019t ask them. I work with the players. I am not asking them if they read the press or if they are influenced by it. I don\u2019t go in that direction. I can\u2019t react \u2013 my honest thought is that I don\u2019t comment.\u201d Chelsea have 20 points, seven more than United, and are second to City on goal difference. \u201cObviously they are not playing Champions League,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cAnd that puts them just [focusing] on the Premier League and in the Premier League the results speak for themselves \u2013 very good results, top of the league and of course lots of good players. \u201cBut history says that when Eden Hazard is the best player of the Premier League, Chelsea is the champion \u2013 it happened with me and Antonio [Conte]. It is still the beginning of course, but if he is the best player of the Premier League until now, Chelsea is [joint] top of the league because he is the kind of player who can make a huge difference.\u201d United have been fined \u20ac15,000 (\u00a313,200) by Uefa for their late arrival and the subsequent delayed kick-off of their Champions League match against Valencia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
