Or do they? Their label\u2019s site says they\u2019re no longer involved, but the pair are known for their inveterate fibbing. Either way, there\u2019s none of Blunt\u2019s deadpan chat and only a couple of (possibly Copeland-delivered) female vocals, a shame as some of the tracks are pleasingly punchdrunk trip-hop instrumentals that cry out for a top line, however meandering. You could imagine MF Doom, Freddie Gibbs or even Kanye West doing their most freewheeling work over something like Leimert. But the pair\u2019s samples are arresting, lurching into tracks like a drunken houseguest, whether it\u2019s a phone call about a shady boyfriend or bleak lines recited from Jim Cartwright\u2019s play Road \u2013 the result is a fugged, fractious collage. As ever, the most beautiful moments are often the most fleeting, such as Sweet Chin Musik, 30 seconds of synths straining as if through a frost-rimed window."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
