And who will play Jerry in the movie?", "bodyText": "Kara Swisher at All Things D has provided a quick run-through of some candidates for the top spot at Yahoo. They are divided into categories, according to what sort of company Yahoo is, or might become. There are four viable sections: The Media Mogul, The Insider, The Microsoftie or Googler, and The Fixer. Swisher also throws in The Holy Grail-Steve Jobs Option, or Apple buys Yahoo. That's presumably attractive because of the stunning success of MobileMe. Of course, Yahoo already tried the Media Mogul route with Terry Semel, and look what happened. The Insider has also been tried, with Jerry Yang and Sue Decker, with even worse results. The Fixer would be a \"turnaround CEO\" like, for example, Gil Amelio, who was brought in to turn a failing Apple computer around. Enough said. So, the most likely option is someone who already knows the Web portal business from having worked at Microsoft, Google or \u2026 Yahoo. Former chief operating officer Dan Rosensweig, for example, wouldn't strictly be The Insider candidate, because he left. Swisher says: Other execs mentioned are former Yahoos Jeff Weiner and Jeff Mallett. But several also pointed to board member John Chapple, who is the one most insiders say they are guessing will be the next CEO, especially since he has been reaching out to Yahoos on many levels and asking questions. Silicon Alley Insider has been on the case for a while. See Help Yahoo Find Its New CEO: Post Nominations Here, from November 17, for more ideas. Swisher's last category, Raise the Yangtanic, asks whether \"there was a need for Co-Founder Jerry Yang to stay around in a significant way\": \"Jerry has been a really bad CEO,\" said one former employee. \"But he could still be an important leader at Yahoo and give the company the kind of inspiration it so desperately needs.\" But there is a problem with Jerry: it looks as though he really hates Microsoft. But everybody can see that, on the net, Microsoft is failing even worse than Yahoo. Yahoo's users and advertisers are not defecting to Microsoft, so Microsoft isn't killing Yahoo. Google is killing Yahoo. Yahoo's staff know that, so why doesn't Yahoo's management? Look at what happened: Jerry Yang screwed up the Microsoft takeover deal and turned to Google for help, effectively diminishing his own search business in the process. A smarter cookie would have been looking for ways to use Microsoft's money to undermine Google. That might already have been a hopeless cause, but a fight to the death and heroic failure would have looked better in the final movie. As it is, whoever gets to play Jerry in Portal Combat: Pirates of Silicon Valley 2 won't be around for the last few scenes. After you've picked a CEO for Yahoo's Last Stand, you can start picking a cast\u2026."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
