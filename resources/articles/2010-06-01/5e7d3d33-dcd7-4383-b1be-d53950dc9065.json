With no new big drama on the schedules The Guide reckons that TV execs need our help. So we've got two of our finest minds on the case to pitch some ultra-high concept new shows \u2013 the sort whose twisty plot and premise can be summed up in a sentence \u2013 to the world's telly bosses. Watch your back, JJ Abrams! ONE IN 60 THE PITCH JUST LIKE 24, BUT EACH ONE-HOUR EPISODE SHOWS JUST ONE RANDOM MINUTE WHAT'S THE STORY? John Sixty (Lost's Matthew Fox) is a tough, uncompromising FBI agent who'll do whatever it takes to protect his country from terrorists. But when a bomb is found on the president's private yacht, John enters a race against time to catch the perpetrators, only to uncover a conspiracy \u2026 that goes all the way to the top. Unlike 24, which let the action unfold minute by real-time minute, One in 60 will only show you one minute of real-time action for every hour of plot, leaping ahead to the next hour when the minute has finished. But which minute in the hour will we see? The minute where John decides to spectacularly blow up the airport for the good of the country? The minute 10 minutes later where he's lying among some polystyrene rubble, covered in soot and crying? Or the minute where he's forlornly trying to get the office vending machine to accept his money? If you love sudden, out-of-context plot lurches that make it impossible to follow what's actually going on, you'll love One In 60. IMMORTAL: PI THE PITCH REMEMBER MAGNUM? WELL HE'S BACK \u2026 AND THIS TIME HE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT DIE WHAT'S THE STORY? Robert Immortal (Lost's Jeff Fahey) was just your average charmingly laidback private detective on the tropical island of Guam; that is until he uncovered a sacred scroll or upset a witch or something, and was cursed with incurable immortality. Will this help or hinder his fight against the arch-criminals of Guam and their vendetta against him, and when will his sexy 23-year-old girlfriend notice that he's stopped ageing? Immortal: PI is not like any private detective show you have ever seen. Set in modern-day Guam, it combines the glamorous locations and snappy dialogue of Magnum PI or Hawaii Five-0 with the fact that the hero is physically unable to die. Will Robert's enemies succeed in their plot to trap and drown him? No, because he cannot die. Will their C4-rigged helicopter blow him to pieces? No, because he cannot die. Will the earthquake \u2026 oh, look, he can't die, OK? He just can't. Immortal: PI is the must-see new show for viewers who like pretty beaches and hate any form of meaningful jeopardy. CATPOCALYPSE! THE PITCH THE EARTH IS BEING INVADED BY ALIENS. HUMANITY IS ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. IT'S CLOVERFIELD \u2026 WITH CATS! WHAT'S THE STORY? The planet is in crisis. Vast alien motherships have positioned themselves above every major city in the world. While their inhabitants are preaching a message of peace, the people of Earth are becoming suspicious. Can they gather together a resistance to banish these monsters to the depths of space before mankind is wiped out forever? Taking inspiration from Andrew O'Hagan's The Life And Opinions Of Maf The Dog, And Of His Friend Marilyn Monroe, Catpocalypse! will tell the story of the invasion via the perspective of Mrs Chiggleton, a cat belonging to resistance members Susan and Jeremy Parker (Lost's Evangeline Lilly and Titus Welliver). However, since Mrs Chiggleton is an animal and therefore is incapable of human thought or reasoning, viewers only glean information about the invasion whenever she wanders within earshot of her owners. For the remainder of the show Mrs Chiggleton just aimlessly passes the time by licking her genitals and meowing. Look out for the finale, where the aliens reveal their intentions and destroy Washington DC while Mrs Chiggleton coughs up a medium-sized hairball on to a hand mirror. POINTY TEETH THE PITCH IT'S TRUE BLOOD FOR THE BALAMORY GENERATION IN A FUTURE WORLD WHERE HUMAN BLOOD IS RUNNING OUT WHAT'S THE STORY? Following the success of teen-oriented vampire nonsense like Twilight, it seemed like a no-brainer to attempt a vampire drama aimed at an even more profitable demographic \u2013 young children and pre-schoolers. And so the action in Pointy Teeth takes place in the garishly-coloured Maine village of Sweethaven. Sadly, producers have tackled the central narrative conceit \u2013 a shortage of human blood \u2013 simply by having the vampires not kill anyone. Indeed, the only act of explicit violence comes when kindly postmaster Clive (Steve Buscemi) throws a parcel at an unruly dog. Elsewhere, Teri Hatcher plays kindly school headmistress Miss Logan, and requires no make-up or prosthetics to adopt the appearance of a vampire. LUNCH HOUR THE PITCH IT'S 24 TIMES MORE INTENSE THAN 24 EVER WAS! WHAT'S THE STORY? Lunch Hour tells of an hour in the life of FBI operative Chad Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips) who has to thwart an attempt on the president's life, the kicker being that he works in IT and only has his lunch hour, plus a 10-minute bathroom break at a push, in which to do it. How will he do this? \"It will probably involve some hacking or blogging or something,\" say producers. And as for how they'll pad out one hour and 10 minutes of action into a full-length TV series? \"We're not sure but we envisage a lot of commercial breaks.\" To up the \"minority president\" ante on 24, the president will be played by The Lady From Sideways Who Always Looks Slightly Smug. Powers's hot daughter will be played by Lacey Turner off of EastEnders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
