But, before the calls go out to the men in white coats to gently lead a deranged columnist off to a better place, it should be pointed out the fighter in question is not Audley but Scott Harrison, who faces Argentina's Juan Pablo Chacon for the World Boxing Organisation version of the featherweight title in front of a 5,000-strong crowd at Glasgow's Braehead Arena on Saturday. Harrison is hard punching, proud and fiercely determined, and would be a worthy heir to the great Scottish champions of the past. Something of a throwback, he is down to earth, trained by his dad and not a man given to hype. As they say, Scott prefers to let his fists do the talking. Scott and Audley Harrison are not related. \u00b7 Depending on your point of view, David Beckham either pushes back the boundaries of fashion as a modern-day style icon or, like some refugee from Andy Pandy, dresses like a big girl's blouse. The mansion and state-of-the-art car collection, while ample enough not to disgrace your average oil sheikh, are to some eyes just a tad OTT. But the way Beckham comforted the five-year-old Manchester United mascot Kalisha Hayward when she burst into tears, overcome by the occasion, as she walked on to the pitch before United's match against Everton, touched the heart. First he wiped away her tears, then decided it would be Kalisha with whom he would have his pre-match kickabout. \"He's a nice man,\" she said afterwards. You can say that again. It was pure class. \u00b7 Mark Hughes's new \u00a3250,000-a-year contract to manage Wales makes him, by some distance, his country's highest paid manager. But the fee will begin to look a bargain investment if Italy can be defeated at the Millennium Stadium on Wednesday. Once it would have seemed inconceivable, but the recent improvement of Hughes's side suggests it is a distinct possibility. Perhaps the hysteria surrounding all matters Sven will make Southampton the focus of the national football consciousness for England's meeting with Macedonia, even if the visitors have about as much chance of winning the European Championship as Sunderland have of winning the Premiership under Howard Wilkinson. But Wales getting the better of the Italian glamour boys in Cardiff . . . now that would be a real story. \u00b7 As England's cricketers set off this week on their unlikely quest to regain the Ashes, they could be forgiven for casting an envious eye to the past. The unpleasant day-long flight was once a journey which all pre-1960 touring parties undertook by boat, with a leisurely six-week cruise. \"Surely it was a little boring?\" the great England wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans was asked at a memorable benefit dinner at Putney's Winchester Club several years ago. Well into his 70s by then, but with the energy and zest for life of a 20-year-old, Godfrey replied: \"Actually, it was rather good. Great fun.\" Saying no more, the honourable old saying of \"What goes on tour, stays on tour\" was upheld, even if the twinkling eyes, grin and twitching mutton-chop side whiskers shouted: \"If only you had been there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
