While early estimates of the costs ran into tens of millions, the brunt has been borne by airlines \u2013 although Gatwick has since spent an extra \u00a34m on anti-drone technology. The airport was closed for 36 hours and then shut down again briefly on 21 December after multiple reported sightings of a drone or drones in the vicinity. Police and military were called in to help at Britain\u2019s second-largest airport, but the perpetrator was never found. More than 1,000 flights were disrupted in the runup to Christmas, with 140,000 passengers affected. EasyJet, which operates about half of all flights at Gatwick, said the attack cost it \u00a315m in compensation and welfare payments to passengers, as well as lost revenue. Announcing annual profits of \u00a3208m, the chief executive of Gatwick, Stewart Wingate, said he \u201cfully stood by the decisions taken back then\u201d to close the airport. He added: \u201cWhen we came under a sustained attack, as we did, we didn\u2019t waver.\u201d He claimed Gatwick had installed \u201csome of the most sophisticated counter-drone equipment of any airport in western Europe\u201d. Wingate admitted the attack may have been an inside job. He said: \u201cThere are many other potential sources and it\u2019s an ongoing investigation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
