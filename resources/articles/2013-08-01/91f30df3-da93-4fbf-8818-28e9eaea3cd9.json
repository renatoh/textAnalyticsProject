When you make a movie, it's nice to be appreciated. But it's genuinely heartening, and rare, to be understood. Whenever I read Philip French's elegant and thoughtful criticism, I felt like I was in the company of someone who not only loved cinema but who felt a sense of responsibility toward it as an art form. His knowledge of movies is vast \u2013 all kinds of movies, and I remember that he had a special fondness for genre pictures and for the work of Walter Hill and others \u2013 and he has always been very generous about sharing it with his readers. I want to say that his criticism, taken altogether, has ennobled cinema, the people who create it and the people who love it. Like his many devoted readers, I'm sorry that he's retiring. The man is irreplaceable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
