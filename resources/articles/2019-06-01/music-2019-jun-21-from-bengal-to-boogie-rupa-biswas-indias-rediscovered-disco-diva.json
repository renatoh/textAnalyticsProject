All that was left was her first name on the album cover, on which she is pictured in a red dress, beaming and holding a cordless mic. It was only when her son Debayan searched for her record online that they found it had been uploaded to YouTube, that original copies of the record were selling for more than \u00a3500, and that it was being reissued by the US label Numero Group. It had earned new fans, such as Dan Snaith, AKA Caribou and Daphni, who brought it to wider attention after including the track Aaj Shanibar in his DJ sets. That track has now had more than a million streams on YouTube. \u201cSome records are just too good to be true,\u201d Snaith says. \u201cI immediately became obsessed with it. It\u2019s one of those records that stands by itself in its own genre \u2013 incorporating Indian pop music, disco and Balearic, but combining them in a unique way.\u201d Rupa, now 64, has finally revealed herself. \u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d she says over a video call from Kolkata, India. \u201cI still don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real.\u201d The early 80s were the height of the disco era in India. Heavyweights such as Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle had traded traditional ghazals [poems dealing with loss and love] for glittery bops. Bollywood composer Bappi Lahiri amalgamated Indian instruments with American funk and pop rhythms to create a hybrid genre; celebrated singer Asha Puthli was at the apex of her career, a regular at Studio 54 in New York and photographed by Andy Warhol. Disco Jazz shared the same concept \u2013 danceable tracks using Indian instruments, mainly the stringed sarod and tabla drums \u2013 even though Rupa had never visited a nightclub. Born Sukla Biswas in 1955, in Malda Town, west Bengal, she tried and failed to make it professionally, before her friend suggested she use Rupa, her nickname at home. Disco Jazz came about after her father took the family on holiday to Canada. \u201cI performed at my brother\u2019s house the first night,\u201d Rupa says. \u201cTwo of my family were so impressed, they arranged for another performance.\u201d At the University of Calgary\u2019s Boris Roubakine Hall, in the autumn of 1981, Rupa sang geets and ghazals for three hours to an audience of about 1,000, including the Grammy-award-winning musician Aashish Khan (who collaborated with George Harrison) and his tabla-playing brother, Pranesh. The Khan brothers were friends of Tilak, Rupa\u2019s eldest brother, and agreed to create an album. She went to the studio to lay down vocal parts written by Firoza, Aashish\u2019s wife, and was handed a cordless mic. \u201cI was confused,\u201d she says, laughing at her own naivety. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was. I thought it was a prop.\u201d Until then, Rupa had only worn traditional Indian clothing: saris and salwar kameez. Needing a new dress for the album cover, she settled on one she found in a kids\u2019 section, and got her hair cut. Thirty-eight years later, she still has the same hairstyle. After laying down her vocals over a few days, she flew with her family to the UK, where her brother Chandan lived. \u201cHe was the one who paid for the recording,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was \u00a31,000. I was too scared to ask Tilak because he was a bit strict.\u201d The songwriters back in Calgary wrote the instrumentation for the record in 12-hour sessions on limited time and an even more limited budget. Months passed and no one contacted her; Rupa had to go out and buy a cassette of the album herself. It was one of a handful of sales. \u201cNazia Hassan\u2019s big hit, Aap Jaisa Koi, overshadowed everything,\u201d she says. Rupa was an unknown artist whom everyone ignored; disheartened, upset and with no pathway to continue, she says she \u201cdidn\u2019t have the energy to sing, to start over\u201d. She got married a few years later, gave birth to Debayan, and occasionally freelanced as a journalist. When accompanying her husband, Udayan, a textile engineer, on business trips, she sometimes performed under her old moniker. In 2010, Udayan died. Unbeknown to her, the songs on her album were used as a soundtrack to the 2012 arthouse Bollywood movie Miss Lovely and had an unofficial release on German label Ovular, later blowing up online thanks to the patronage of Snaith and others. \u201cDespite in some ways being very much of its time, it still sounds completely fresh,\u201d says Snaith. \u201cIt feels great to have so much love,\u201d Rupa acknowledges. \u201cAfter all these years, people like my music.\u201d She admits that she wouldn\u2019t trade the life she has now for any fame she would have achieved then. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the money. I\u2019m just happy that people like my music. Boys, girls, everyone is dancing so much. That\u2019s what makes me happy.\u201d \u2022 Disco Jazz is out on Numero Group"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
