He collided with James Hook during the first half and required extensive treatment on the field before being taken to hospital. \"We think his injury is very serious,\" Andy Robinson said after the match. The Scotland coach added: \"He has seriously hurt his back and it is a big concern. Thom's parents are with him now, and our thoughts are with his family.\" Back in the stadium, fans concentrated on the game and when the final whistle went it was raining beer. Tens of thousands of roaring Welsh supporters leapt to their feet, hurling their glasses into the air and showering the ground. They had just seen their team complete one of the great comebacks in the history of rugby, not just the Six Nations. In a few mad minutes, Wales scored two converted tries and a penalty, overhauling Scotland's 10-point lead to snatch a 31-24 win. Warren Gatland, the Wales coach, said it was \"one of the most amazing games I have ever been involved in\". Scotland were superb and took control after scoring two tries in the first 20 minutes. That was as many as they had managed in their past six Test matches. Wales's assistant coach Shaun Edwards should, by right and reputation, have been furious with his side's defensive performance. But like Gatland, the head coach, Edwards was too busy trying to get his head around what he had just seen. \"This was one of those games when you say: 'I was there.'\" Heading into the final 10 minutes, Scotland were 24-14 up. And then things fell apart. Two Scottish players were sent to the sin bin in the space of nine minutes. Robinson had no quibbles with the first of the cards, agreeing that Scott Lawson had been in the wrong when he dived into a ruck. After that, Wales scored a try through Leigh Halfpenny that cut the deficit to three points. But Robinson was less than happy with the second yellow card. Phil Godman was sent off the pitch for tripping Lee Byrne. \"I am bitterly disappointed about thatpenalty. I've seen the tape, it was not a trip and that has cost us the game.\" The Wales captain, Ryan Jones, consulted the referee and established there was still \"time for some more rugby\" and so opted to let Stephen Jones kick the penalty that tied the scores. \"We knew we had time to get the ball back,\" Ryan Jones explained, \"but if I have to make many more decisions like that and I will be as grey as Warren or as bald as Shaun.\" Reduced to 13 men, and with seconds to play, the Scots had to restart for a final time. Robinson tried to tell his players to kick the restart into touch and settle for the draw. To his evident regret, the message did not get through. His captain, Chris Cusiter, said that his team were so caught up in the heat of the moment they still felt they could win. As it was, Wales recaptured possession, and Shane Williams was able to score a decisive try. \"We committed suicide,\" a rueful Robinson said. \"The headlines will be about the Welsh comeback, but apart from 10 minutes of sheer madness we should have won. We have got some distraught and hurting players in that dressing room, but I truly believe that the Scottish nation should be proud of how these guys played.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
