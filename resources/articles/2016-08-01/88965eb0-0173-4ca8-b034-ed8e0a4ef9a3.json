The cost of a care home room has risen by 5.2% in the last year, more than 10 times the average increase in pensioners income, according to a report by Prestige Nursing and Care. The figures highlight the financial crisis in the care home industry and the impact this is having on older people and their families. Four Seasons Health Care, Britain\u2019s biggest care home group, reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a3264m last year and that it was struggling under the weight of more than \u00a3500m of debt. The sharp increase in the cost of a room follows the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in April, which means all workers over 25 must be paid at least \u00a37.20 an hour. The average annual pensioner\u2019s income of \u00a314,456 would now cover less than six months\u2019 care. The shortfall is equal to \u00a3317 a week or \u00a316,470 a year, 9% higher than a year ago. This is despite pensioners enjoying an increase in their income for the last five years, ahead of the average household. The survey by Prestige Nursing does not take into account the value of assets, such as property. It was based on a survey of 165 care homes and official government statistics. Jonathan Bruce, the managing director of Prestige Nursing, said: \u201cIt is particularly alarming that care home costs have risen almost 10 times as much as pensioner incomes in real terms, with the result that older people will find the challenge of paying for care even more out of their reach.\u201d Care England, which represents care homes, lambasted the government for the crisis in the industry, accusing ministers of not having a strategy for older adult care and allowing local authorities to pay well below the cost of care for residents with state funding. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said: \u201cI have great sympathy [for residents]. There is a dynamic in this called ageism. Why is it that when you get old and get a disease called dementia, you have to pay for it? I don\u2019t know how in the age of the Equality Act you have older people having to pay for a service that younger people get for free. \u201cThe government needs to have a proper approach to social care. Just pumping money into the NHS isn\u2019t going to work. They need a clear approach, saying that this is what good social care costs. The government needs to show a bit of leadership, I am sick of them hiding behind localism and saying it is about local councils.\u201d Some local authorities are paying just \u00a3330 a week for residents, the equivalent of less than \u00a32 an hour. Industry research has shown that private residents now pay 40% more on average than publicly funded residents for like-for-like service. Roughly two fifths of care homes residents are private, with another two fifths funded by the state. The remaining residents include those who pay fees but are topped up by local authorities and residents who are funded by the NHS. Prestige Nursing offers home-care services for older people, but Green said this was not an alternative for people with dementia or other conditions who needed round-the-clock care. He added: \u201cI think they are pitching to say, \u2018People don\u2019t need to be in care homes and we can provide these things much cheaper.\u2019 But actually, these people are in care homes because they can\u2019t be at home.\u201d Green said it was ridiculous to blame the rising fees and the funding crunch in the industry on private companies. He said state-run social care had been of a \u201clow quality and expensive\u201d before private companies expanded into the market. \u201cThe government is not stepping up to the mark,\u201d he added. Tim Hammond, the chief executive of Four Seasons, said: \u201cIt is widely recognised that there is underfunding of social care for both care homes and home care. \u201cThe average local authority weekly fee last year for a care home place was around \u00a3560 a week, which equates to about \u00a33.30 an hour to cover 24/7 care, including nursing or dementia care, accommodation, mostly in rooms with en-suite facilities, meals, heating, lighting, laundry. \u201cAs a result of funding constraints, the fees that local authorities pay for care have declined 5% in real terms over the past three or four years. According to independent analysis they are below the fair cost of the care being provided.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
