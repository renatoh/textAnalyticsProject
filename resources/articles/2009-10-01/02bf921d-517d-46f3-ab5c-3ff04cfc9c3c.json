Three miles north of the Dark Peak, and five south of a sprawl that runs all the way to Leeds, it mingles town and country, for starters. It mixes, too, the temperance of the chapel with the beer of the Nook, ancient stone mullions with double-fronted garages, modern prosperity with crumbling mills. Most of all, though, it mixes people. In the farms that litter surrounding hills, you will still hear a \"yonder\", or even a \"thou\". But Yorkshire true-bloods have, for decades, lived in peaceful coexistence with southern \"comers-in\", their lifestyles familiar to fans of Tamara Drewe. Many small towns are essentially ribbons, but the heart of Holmfirth is a bustling node, where several streets come together. This attractive centre, made famous by the soporific if seemingly immortal Last of the Summer Wine, stands out for its lack of high-street names \u2013 there was never a Woollies, a Smith's or a Boots, still less a McDonald's. Unused to the gales of big competition, the small shops and their customers reacted with fear when Tesco announced plans for a megastore just outside the town. The tough retailer was not an easy thing to take on, but last week a spirited residents' campaign claimed victory, and the application was withdrawn. Shoppers from the wuthering heights of Cartworth Moor and the lows of Norridge Bottom will now continue to mingle in the heart of Holmfirth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
