She plays Lisa, the manager of a neighbourhood bar in Texas where the waitresses are forced to wear skimpy outfits and flirt with the dodgy, good ol\u2019 boy clientele. This has the toe-curling name of Double Whammies but insists on seeing itself as a family place with a safely naughty vibe. Lisa is a tough professional who keeps the show on the road while maintaining a protective love and concern for the vulnerable semi-clad women under her wing, including Maci (Haley Lu Richardson) and Jennelle (Dylan Gelula) \u2013 both excellent \u2013 though she has serious problems in her own home life: a failed relationship with a depressive guy called Cameron (Lawrence Varnardo) who has yet to move out. Her problems mount when she generously stages a semi-legal carwash \u201cfundraiser\u201d outside the bar to help a waitress who\u2019s suffered abuse. It forces her to confront the grisliness of the business she\u2019s in. Support the Girls barrels along with wit, flair and gusto from the actors. Richardson in particular is completely unrecognisable from her very serious, ruminative turn as the architecture student Casey in Kogonada\u2019s complex drama Columbus from 2017. The sinew and steel of Hall\u2019s own performance comes out as she has to deal with the bar\u2019s cynical owner Cubby (James Le Gros), and his contribution underscores Bujalski\u2019s skill in creating flawed male characters whose weaknesses are exposed by the women who have to deal with them. Support the Girls is a shrewdly observed, day-in-the-life-style portrait of a woman under pressure. It\u2019s way too early to be thinking about awards season, but Regina Hall could be in line for some silverware."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
