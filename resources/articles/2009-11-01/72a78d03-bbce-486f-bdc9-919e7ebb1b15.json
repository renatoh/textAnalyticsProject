Tenor Paul Agnew sang as one of the seven vocalists from the French baroque specialist group, and also directed the ensemble, which included four continuo players \u2013 though the term director has never been more lightly worn. Giving no cues and making no physical gestures beyond meaningful looks, Agnew's interventions were practically imperceptible; he and his colleagues must have done a huge amount of preparation to achieve performances that were so immaculately assured and yet sounded so spontaneous. As Agnew pointed out in a pre-concert talk, the 10 items in Monteverdi's collection, though published together in 1614, were composed during the period after his previous volume had appeared in 1605. In between, he had composed Orfeo and the now-lost Arianna for the court of Mantua, as well as suffering the loss of his wife, and of his protege, the soprano Caterina Martinelli, for whom the title role in Arianna was written. In the light of these emotional upheavals, the dark centrepiece of the book, the mournful Sestina and the arrangement of the poignant Lament from Arianna, define its distinctive mode. But what was most remarkable about the performances of these weighty items, as well as the lighter madrigals, was the perfect balancing of words and notes. It was in a unity of expression that matched rhythmic freedom with a heightened perception of textual meaning, effortlessly realising the intimate intensity of the settings. In them, Monteverdi stands on the cusp of the Renaissance and the baroque \u2013 but here he sounded like our contemporary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
