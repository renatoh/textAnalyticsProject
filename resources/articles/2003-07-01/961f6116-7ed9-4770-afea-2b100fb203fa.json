Not long before Thomas Bjorn's chip from the front edge of the 18th green failed to drop, thus handing the 26-year-old from Kent, Ohio, his first professional tournament victory, he had been on the practice ground. He had gone there as clubhouse leader, hitting wedges in the hope that despite Bjorn's two-shot lead his one-under-par total of 283 might be enough to force a play-off. As Bjorn began to throw away his lead, most notably in the fairway bunker on 16 that brought him a double bogey, Curtis slipped inside a Portakabin to watch. As the roar that met Bjorn's vain effort drifted from the grandstands, Curtis hopped on the buggy that was to transport him to his appointment with the claret jug. Only when he came across his fiancee Candace Beatty did his emotions spill over. She almost cut him in half with her embrace, doubtless pleased that their wedding, scheduled for August 23, can now be more lavish. The unassuming manner was briefly swept aside too when he gave his speech on the green, tears following his mention of family. They didn't last long, however, and he was composure itself as, seated behind the most famous trophy in golf, he explained how he had won. \"I was shaking in my boots, obviously, but I was very focused on what I had to do and let my work speak for itself. And if that was not good enough, fine, I can cope with that. \"I knew yesterday afternoon that once I got going on the back nine I had a chance of winning. Today I just got off to a better start and got ahead. \"When I looked up at the scoreboard when I finished and saw that I was two back and he [Bjorn] had three holes to play and those are not easy holes, I knew I needed to make my putt on 18 to have a chance. I said 'Make it . . . if you want to win this thing, make it.' I did, and fortunately everything came out right.\" Curtis was introduced to the game by his grandfather, who owned a public course in Ohio. \"I grew up in a house on the 18th green for 12 years so it's always been there.\" After showing promise as a junior he went to Kent State University where he met his fiancee, who was on the women's golf team. His previous best showing was his semi-final place in the US Amateur in 1999. \"It felt as big as this at the time,\" he said. Despite his modest achievements prior to yesterday he clearly has a steely nerve. Andy Sutton, the English caddie who got the bag only because his regular employer John Bickerton missed the cut at the Scottish Open and decided to take a week off rather than try to qualify, described him as \"icy\". \"Ben just took it all in his own pace; he is ice cold, he just deals with everything. I honestly thought he was just glad to be here. He was just lapping up the whole tournament. He was in the merchandise tent on Friday afternoon, as you do, buying T-shirts. He is a great guy to work for, the nicest guy you will ever meet. \"When I saw him hitting the ball, though, he leaked a few. He was clearly a brilliant putter but all I saw was this leaking shot and I didn't think he was an Open champion. I'm a pessimist and even last night I was in the pub preparing for him to shoot 80 today and finish 20th.\" Curtis was generous as well as calm in victory, expressing sympathy for Bjorn. \"He played great all week. Being four under for a major championship is no slack at all. He could be sitting here just as easily as I am. I feel bad for him.\" Curtis said he would try and \"keep normal\", but that may be difficult. When he was asked how it felt never to have to qualify for another major, he was speechless. \"My life is going to change, but I'm looking forward to it. A lot of great challenges lie ahead of me.\" The next one is his wedding, which he would have been planning at home - while watching the golf - had he not qualified for the Open. \"I'd probably be sitting around watching the golf, that's what I'd probably be doing. I'm glad I came, definitely.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
