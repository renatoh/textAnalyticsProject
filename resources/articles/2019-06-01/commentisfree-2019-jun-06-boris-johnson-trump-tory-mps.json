In the different political universe of four years ago, when Trump\u2019s odds of clinching the Republican nomination were judged to be 1%, everyone \u2013 including members of the Grand Old Party \u2013 could ridicule and excoriate this reality TV tycoon as an absurd clown. Who can forget the bitter primary contest when Ted Cruz flamed him as \u201ca pathological liar\u201d, \u201cutterly amoral\u201d, \u201ca serial philanderer\u201d and a \u201crat\u201d? \u201cWhy would we trust him in the White House?\u201d he asked. Or what of the bitter tirades of Marco Rubio, who denounced Trump for turning \u201cthe most important election in a generation into a freak show\u201d, called him a \u201ccon artist\u201d, an embarrassment, who attacked his \u201cdangerous style of leadership\u201d, and pleaded for Republican voters to \u201cend this lunacy\u201d? Then there\u2019s the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested that Republican colleagues fearful of losing their seats should break with Trump, declaring: \u201cWe\u2019ll drop him like a hot rock.\u201d Or the former House speaker, Paul Ryan, who correctly described comments by Trump as the \u201ctextbook definition of racist\u201d? They all capitulated, of course, every single one. Everyone is entitled to change their mind when the facts do. But no facts have changed about Trump: he remains a pathological liar, a conman, utterly amoral (dismissed by Trump as fake news), and the Republican establishment \u2013 as tawdry and venal as it is \u2013 knows all this. But Trumpism became a convenient vehicle with which to slash taxes for the rich, to deregulate, to attack even the modest reforms of Obamacare, and to undermine environmental and consumer protections and workers\u2019 rights. The \u201cfreak show\u201d described by Rubio serves a purpose: it provides a distraction, as the author Naomi Klein has noted, from Trump\u2019s actual political agenda. To paraphrase Theresa May, in her first prime minister\u2019s questions: \u201cRemind you of anybody?\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s mini-me, Boris Johnson, is in the ascendant: the Tory crown is his to lose. But his colleagues know he\u2019s an incompetent, a man who cares only for himself, who was fired twice \u2013 by a newspaper editor and a party leader \u2013 over allegations of dishonesty. A former adviser to Michael Gove recalls how, in meetings, \u201che was never prepared\u201d, that \u201che could never focus\u201d, that he was \u201can embarrassment\u201d, and that \u201cnearly everyone who worked with him says the same\u201d. When Amber Rudd memorably declared, \u201cYou can\u2019t trust him to take you home at the end of the evening,\u201d it seemed she was simply summing up the private thinking of many of her colleagues. That hasn\u2019t stopped her allegedly attempting to strike a pact with him, of course. Tory MPs know Johnson is a farcical choice for prime minister. But they are also desperate. They fear a Labour party that will overturn an economic and political consensus constructed by Margaret Thatcher four decades ago, and they see the rising tide of Farageism lapping at their feet. They have concluded that the normal rules of politics have been abandoned; and that the mass politics of a second Corbyn general election campaign can only be answered with a guy who gets spontaneous requests for selfies on the high street. The Republican party is now the Trump party, and the Trumpification of our own Conservative party beckons too. Just as Trump was, we were reassured, basically just a bombastic New York Democrat, Johnson, it\u2019s claimed, is really just a \u201cone nation Conservative\u201d. Let\u2019s get real here about a man who called black people \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d; who wrote of \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d and declared that if equal marriage was permissible, why not a union \u201cbetween three men, as well as two men, or indeed three men and a dog\u201d; who edited the Spectator when it published an article declaring black people had lower IQs than whites, who joked about cleaning the dead bodies from Libya to turn it into a tourist resort; and who compared Muslim women to bank robbers and letterboxes. Johnson, in truth, will say or do anything he thinks is to his own political advantage. He knows the remaining Tory party membership is Ukip in exile; and he knows the Tories\u2019 electoral chances hinge on winning back those voters who have defected en masse to the hard-right Brexit party. A key ally will be Jacob Rees-Mogg, an ultra-reactionary opponent of LGBTQ rights and abortion who seems to attract unpleasant, sinister supporters. We can expect a Johnson government to rely on bigotry and demagoguery: both will build support for a no-deal exit from the EU and deflect from economic policies that will only benefit Britain\u2019s elites. Some Tories will privately consider it all terribly vulgar, troubling even \u2013 but they will go along with this dangerous show, just as Trump\u2019s arch-nemeses in the Republican party did. The Boris Johnson circus, like Trump\u2019s, will prove the ultimate distraction: much of the media, which goes giddy at the knees at his every absurd pronouncement, will indulge where they should scrutinise. As an increasingly authoritarian brand of rightwing populism consolidates its grip on power, Johnson will be its slapstick front man. And so back to a version of my initial question. Who are the biggest frauds and charlatans: Johnson, or the Tories who will help impose him on Britain, despite knowing how dangerous he is? \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
