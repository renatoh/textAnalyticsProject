Everything you do becomes soundtracked by one seemingly omnipresent melody, one incessant beat. You might pride yourself on not knowing what it is, but it will prevail regardless. This is the song of the summer. In 2013 it was the relentless funk of Daft Punk\u2019s Get Lucky. In 2003 Beyonc\u00e9 was inescapably Crazy in Love with Jay-Z; and 1999 rang with Lou Bega\u2019s shopping list of lovers, Mambo No 5. Last year, in the UK at least, it was a three-way tie between Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa\u2019s One Kiss, Drake\u2019s God\u2019s Plan and George Ezra\u2019s Shotgun. Those three songs went on to become the three biggest sellers of the year and, in Ezra\u2019s case at least, led to lucrative festival headline bookings this summer. In the UK, the biggest music sales period traditionally used to be the run-up to Christmas, both for albums (as gifts) and singles (in the race for Christmas No 1). But as we purchase less music directly and swing behind streaming, the summer, stretching from as early as April to late September, is much more lucrative. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely difficult now to have a \u2018new\u2019 Christmas hit: the playlist-heavy patterns of streaming mean the classics are played heavily,\u201d says Stuart Dredge, editor at music-industry publication Music Ally. \u201cWho\u2019d go up against Mariah?\u201d In broadcasting, too, the summer is considered a more exciting time of the year for music. \u201cFor us at Radio 1, it\u2019s always felt that summer songs were more important than Christmas songs,\u201d says Radio 1 and 1Xtra\u2019s head of music, Chris Price. \u201cI think that\u2019s because young people own the summer.\u201d School and university ends, it\u2019s festival season and time for holidays. The summer months have an intensity that the rest of the year lacks, and any record that can sum up that elusive feeling is destined for a permanent place in listeners\u2019 hearts. So what can prospective summertime songwriters do to optimise their chances of a hit as the mercury rises? An aura of end-of-term excitement is a good start. \u201cI\u2019m constantly trying to capture summer feelings,\u201d explains Carly Rae Jepsen, she of the 18m-selling Call Me Maybe (song of the summer 2012). \u201cI\u2019ll be like: \u2018The chorus needs to lift so it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got the wind in your hair and you\u2019re on a rollercoaster and running to the top of the mountain!\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018OK \u2026\u2019\u201d Yet a summer tune need not be as light and hooky as Call Me Maybe. Billie Eilish\u2019s Bad Guy couldn\u2019t be moodier yet it feels as though it could seep into the long shadows of muggy evenings. \u201cThe key ingredient is a massive, simple chorus, easy to jump to in a field somewhere,\u201d says Beats 1 host Matt Wilkinson. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t always have to be Good Vibrations or the most obvious summery song. It can be a dark song.\u201d With the global appetite for Latin music from reggaeton to salsa seeming insatiable, its rhythms are more of an asset than ever. This year, Sech\u2019s Otro Trago and Lunay\u2019s Soltera are set to be the songs of 2019\u2019s summer in Latin America; and because we Brits associate Latin culture with sunshine, it\u2019s the optimum time for them to cross over here, too. Craig Kallman, CEO of Atlantic Records, produced Cardi B\u2019s 2018 summer hit I Like It. He spent seven months considering the \u201cincredible danceable, rhythmic party nature of Latin music\u201d to make something summer-perfect, built around a sample from Pete Rodriguez\u2019s I Like It Like That, pulled from his 750,000-strong record collection. I Like It seems even more precision engineered for summertime success than most such hits, featuring not only Cardi B, whose popularity and goodwill was peaking, but also Bad Bunny and J Balvin, two of Latin pop\u2019s biggest stars. \u201cMaking one of those summertime anthems was certainly an aspiration,\u201d Kallman says. \u201cThinking that this could be one of those records that\u2019s played and heard in every car driving down the block, every block party, every backyard barbecue, every schoolyard, as well as being a nightclub anthem.\u201d In 2016 another Latin hit, Luis Fonsi\u2019s unstoppable Despacito, became huge on its own considerable merits in the Americas, but earned its British success off its Spanish-language exoticism; listening to it felt like going on a summer holiday of the mind. Such records are doubly potent if you throw in a novelty element, such as Las Ketchup\u2019s The Ketchup Song (Aserej\u00e9) and Los Del Rio\u2019s immortal Macarena, both of which sparked global dance crazes in 2002 and 1995 respectively. This year, Daddy Yankee\u2019s Con Calma, which interpolates Canadian rapper Snow\u2019s 1992 track Informer, seems to tick this particular box. \u201cThe songs that typically stand out as potential songs of the summer often have a novelty factor,\u201d says Jon Klein, who works on pop playlists at Apple Music. \u201cBut not necessarily in a bad way. The novelty is that they\u2019re unique sounding and seemingly emerge out of nowhere.\u201d Timing is everything. Ezra\u2019s Shotgun was intended to be the lead single from his 2018 album Staying at Tamara\u2019s, but his record company deliberately held it back in order to hit as summer began, when that \u201cunderneath the hot sun\u201d lyric might make sense, even under unpredictable British skies. \u201cWe were originally looking at the single coming out in January,\u201d says Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, Ezra\u2019s A&amp;R, \u201cand I was like: \u2018There\u2019s no way that we\u2019re doing that.\u2019 We got a great note from Ed Sheeran going: \u2018Bloody hell, why is that record not out now?\u2019\u201d In the end, the song was pushed to radio and TV in May when it was already a fan favourite. It spent 12 weeks in the top 3 and is still in the UK top 50. \u201cThere\u2019s no evil, twisted marketing engineering,\u201d says Unger-Hamilton. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy a campaign with a suntan lotion company or anything. It was the right artist on the right campaign at the right time.\u201d Ezra is an established artist with a legion of listeners ready to lap up his folk-pop gap-year tales; if you are a newer artist, it might pay to unleash your bid for summer ubiquity a bit earlier. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly planning,\u201d says Price of Radio 1 and 1Xtra\u2019s music policy. \u201cWe\u2019ll work maybe three to six months out.\u201d For streaming playlist success, it also helps to give listeners a longer lead time. \u201cIf it\u2019s a new artist or an emerging sound, it can take months to reach the summit,\u201d Klein confirms. Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road, a song that most commentators agree has the potential to be this summer\u2019s definitive song, was first released in December. It found its feet by hopping on savvy hashtags on the Gen-Z video app TikTok, tapped into not one but two current trends (country and trap), and really caught on in the UK after Billy Ray Cyrus appeared on a remix to growl about Fendi sports bras. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the song of festivals this year,\u201d Wilkinson reckons. \u201cAt campsites, people will start singing it at 6am.\u201d Could a changing pop landscape undermine the definitive song of the summer, though? With streaming and social media levelling the landscape, we are likely to have more years like 2018, where no one song dominates. This fragmenting of our collective cultural experience prompted Rolling Stone to declare that the song of the summer no longer exists, replaced instead by a playlist\u2019s worth of tracks favoured by different demographics. This is partly because radio cannot necessarily make or break a song in the way it could 20 years ago. The process has become much more fragmented and having your song added to the right streaming playlist can be just as important. \u201cBefore, I think you could engineer it: right artist, right song, right support, right timing, everything,\u201d say Zane Lowe, global creative director at Apple Music. \u201cNow, with streaming, there are no guarantees. Even the biggest artists can come back now with a song that on paper, and when you hear it, you think is a complete no brainer. But then it\u2019s like: \u2018Why is it sitting at No 6 on the chart?\u2019\u201d The final ingredient, then, is some kind of alchemy. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t know!\u201d says Jepsen of her global megasmash. And despite the months of hard labour that went into Cardi\u2019s I Like It, Kallman could never be sure it would land. \u201cI just felt like we had something special and magical,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can never predict what is going to ultimately happen.\u201d So what will be the song \u2013 or rather the songs \u2013 of summer this year? Behind the scenes, they will have been honed and prepared like so many beach bodies, but it will take far more than that, some ineffable magic, to truly make them shine. Song of the summer 2019: the contenders Meduza \u2013 Piece of Your Heart (feat Goodboys) By pairing one melody nicked from another previous summer smash by David Guetta with a chorus designed to be chanted in cheap swimwear, this deep house roller is 2019\u2019s poolside anthem of choice. Blinkie \u2013 Little Love (feat Grace Tither) Every summer needs a totally generic, HD-polished piano house track to soundtrack the more carefree montages in Love Island, and this is 2019\u2019s, hoisted aloft by a piercingly catchy chorus. See also: Ti\u00ebsto, Jonas Blue and Rita Ora\u2019s Ritual. India Jordan \u2013 DNT STP MY LV Destined to instil complete pandemonium at all summer festivals is this high-tempo dance track built around a Todd Edwards-style cut-up vocal sample; pure UV radiation in music. Luca H\u00e4nni \u2013 She Got Me With its reggaeton beat and Major Lazer-style sirens, Switzerland\u2019s Eurovision entry already invites tequila shots with strangers \u2013 and its \u201cdirty dancing!\u201d chorus will ensure the year\u2019s most ill-advised holiday romances. Lizzo \u2013 Truth Hurts Juice was the big single, but this track from the Minneapolis rapper is slow-burning its way onto everyone\u2019s summer playlists thanks to its constant punchlines and catchy chorus kiss-off. G-Eazy \u2013 West Coast (feat Blueface) It\u2019s a toss-up between this, DaBaby\u2019s Suge and YG\u2019s Go Loko for the slow, low-riding rap track to play out of your car to pretend you\u2019re rolling through LA while negotiating a sofa-warehouse car park. Stardust \u2013 Music Sounds Better With You The summer smash of 1998 has been depressingly absent from streaming services and YouTube, but it will finally arrive on 28 June to enthral a new generation with its Chaka Khan-sampling genius. Dalex \u2013 Pa M\u00ed (Remix feat Rafa Pab\u00f6n, Khea, Sech, Feid, Cazzu &amp; Lenny Tav\u00e1rez) Well, it won\u2019t do a Despacito, but this is the warm-evening Latin hit of the year, with an extremely sensual top line; taken from the album Climaxxx, whose title tells you exactly what it is designed for. Steve Lacy \u2013 Playground The way the slap bass and jangling guitars combine in the opening 20 seconds of this song are the most summery thing imaginable, and Lacy\u2019s falsetto vocal continues to keep the clouds at bay. Miley Cyrus \u2013 Party Up the Street (feat Swae Lee &amp; Mike WiLL Made-It) Time was that a Miley Cyrus song called Party Up the Street would have namechecked molly and featured LMFAO, but this slowly pulsating track is admirably restrained \u2013 you can feel the heat rising as if from evening tarmac.
