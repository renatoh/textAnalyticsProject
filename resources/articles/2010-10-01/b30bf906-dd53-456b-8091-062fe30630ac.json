The 28 year-old Lions centre yesterday signed for Saracens almost three months after telling Ospreys he did not intend to see out the final year of his contract and wanted to join a club in the London area. Wasps and London Irish turned down the chance to sign him but Saracens moved last week after their fly-half Derick Hougaard sustained a long-term injury. Henson has trained with Saracens twice this week and will fit his commitment to his new club around his Strictly Come Dancing schedule, spending his mornings with the club and his afternoons and evenings on the dance floor. He signed up for the BBC programme only after Ospreys refused to release him from his contract last August. \"Everyone has to earn and Strictly was not just a commitment but a priority,\" Henson said. \"That comes first and I will try to fit training in and around it. When my involvement with the programme does end I will be able to play straight away then. I would hope to be playing within three or four weeks, maybe a bit longer, but I want to do well on Strictly. There is a chance I could play while still on the programme. \"I still cannot get over how hard dancing is: rugby is easy in comparison. I am confident I can get back to the level I was at before I took time out from the game last year. Saracens are the right club to help me achieve that. I was a bit selfish in wanting to get out of Wales but I still have a huge ambition to play for my country. The World Cup is being held next year and it bugs me that I have yet to play in the tournament. \"The Six Nations is coming up in a few months and I would like to be a part of it. I don't think it will be too soon for me. I am a positive person and think I will pick up my rugby skills quickly. My hunger for the game is back: I was not in a great frame of mind when I stopped playing but everything has been sorted out and I am grateful I still have time on my side.\" Henson has signed for Saracens until the end of the season, not wanting to commit himself beyond that because he wants to be free to train with Wales, if asked, during their July training camps. Under Premiership rugby rules, he would not be released if he were contracted to a leading English club and he intends to negotiate his contracts in future one year at a time. \"I am a loyal person,\" he said. \"I was with the Ospreys for almost 10 years if you count Swansea. I want this to be a long-term thing but I have two kids living in Wales so I have to be careful of committing myself for too long. I will probably only just sign one-year deals from now on because I want to see my children and I don't know where they are going to be. If I ever go back to Wales it will be to Ospreys, no doubt.\" Henson said that part of the reason for returning to rugby was that he felt, despite the name he has made, he had not proved himself as a player. He has won 31 Wales caps since making his debut nine years ago, has never appeared in the World Cup and his own Lions tour, to New Zealand in 2005, was anticlimactic. \"I like to think the best is yet to come from me,\" he said. \"That is why I have got back in the game. I have done all right in the past but I think I can play a lot better than I ever have. That is what drives me. I want get back in there. I want to be a big name and be regarded as a great player. I have got a lot of work to do. I am 28 now and I do look after myself. I hope I can play rugby for another eight to 10 years and I want every honour there is. I want to win things and be as good as I can be. The Lions tour was a massive disappointment and I hope I can put that right.\" The details of Henson's move to Saracens have not been divulged. The Welsh region received compensation having been told they were likely to lose any legal battle over the validity of the player's contract, having not paid him for more than a year. Henson will receive more through image rights than wages and Saracens will have quickly to provide the paperwork to Premiership Rugby to show that the deal, in which Henson replaces Hougaard on the payroll under the injury dispensation rule, keeps the club within the limits of the salary cap. Henson said he felt his fame would be less of a hindrance in Hertfordshire than it was in Wales. \"I wanted to be at a London club because I have opportunities off the field in rugby so I thought it was best to be around here where I am not so well recognised. Saracens moved quickly and their enthusiasm impressed me. I had been a free agent for ages and no-one really wanted me. \"I am expecting to take some hits and some banter and that's fine,\" he added. \"I will enjoy that. I like to think I am a bit of a playmaker and I like attracting players to me when I am playing to free up space for other people. The rules have changed, so there is a lot for my head to get around but rugby is pretty natural to me. I have played it since I was five so I am hoping it will come back pretty instinctively. I am thinking that I can come straight back in and play to a level that I was playing before, if not better. The process may take a bit longer but I have to get straight back on it. I want to get in the Wales team, so I can't mess around. I have got to be good.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
