The University of New South Wales Andrew and Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law has examined best practice refugee policy throughout the world, crafting seven principles as a foundation for \u201ca more positive, long-term approach\u201d to how Australia treats those seeking asylum. In a paper to be launched by the UNSW chancellor, David Gonski, on Thursday, the Kaldor Centre director, Prof Jane McAdam, lays out principles for Australia\u2019s refugee policy based on what has worked, and is working, to better meet international obligations, the needs of asylum seekers and the countries who take them in. The intervention comes as the governor of Manus province, Charlie Benjamin, called on Australia and the new prime minister of Papua New Guinea, James Marape, to take asylum seekers and refugees off Manus Island. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be here and Australia, you have to take responsibility. You have to move them,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cDefinitely I will be raising it with the new prime minister \u2026 I\u2019ll get him to talk to the Australians. \u201cThe PNG government can\u2019t do much, Manus [province] can\u2019t do much.\u201d McAdam told Guardian Australia the paper \u201cis looking and learning from good practices from our own history and from overseas\u201d. \u201cI think for over 75 years, Australia provided really positive outcomes for refugees \u2013 for a long time we were a global leader in protection and we gave people the chance for a new life, new opportunities and a renewed hope. \u201cBut in the last 25 years, our policy has changed direction somewhat and we have ended up with things like offshore processing, boat turnbacks and mandatory detention, which not only deny the humanity to people that applied and deflect problems elsewhere, but also violate many of our obligations under international law.\u201d That change, which McAdam said grew progressively from the \u201cunfortunate conflation\u201d of the 2001 Tampa refugee crisis with the September 11 attacks just a few weeks later, \u201cled to a rushing through of really draconian laws\u201d, which had been built on by successive governments. \u201cThe political rhetoric that has been developed over the last 25 years has served to dehumanise and demonise people who have done nothing wrong,\u201d McAdam said. \u201cEveryone has the right to seek asylum and Australia, like every other country that has signed up to the refugee convention, has an obligation to ensure that we don\u2019t send people back to persecution, or serious harm and unfortunately Australia\u2019s policies not only violate that, but violate many other parts of international law, including, in particular, our policy of mandatory and indefinite detention.\u201d To reset the last quarter of a century of refugee policy, McAdam said Australian governments did not have to look far. First, Australia needed to comply with its international legal obligations, which included not sending people back to places where they faced a real risk of harm or persecution, which would include an end to boat turnbacks. That would also mean repealing parts of the Migration Act while also repealing offshore detention. The second principle would be an end to mandatory, indefinite detention to provide \u201chumane, fair reception conditions\u201d. Asylum seekers should be processed within Australia and given dignified living conditions. Next, there should be a \u201cfair, efficient and transparent\u201d system to process asylum claims, with decisions made by \u201csuitably qualified, independent\u201d adjudicators. This would include access to legal advice and representation, as found in some Scandinavian countries, and an independent review process, such as the one found in France and Canada, was also deemed crucial. Fourth, the system should respect the principles of family unity and the best interests of the child, with the Netherlands, EU and Sweden all showing examples of best practice. It must also provide additional safe, lawful pathways to protection, including safe routes to seek asylum, and community and private sponsorship were also suggested. Australia implemented its own special humanitarian program in 2015 and 2017, under Tony Abbott\u2019s directive, for asylum seekers fleeing Iraq and Syria, which the centre uses as a best-practice example, as well as noting the 1979 to 1997 community resettlement program, which helped more than 30,000 refugees. Providing global and regional leadership on refugee protection, through engaging and cooperating with other countries to ensure protection and durable solutions for those fleeing conflict, as was done for Indochinese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s, formed the basis of the sixth principle. The seventh, and final, related to investment in refugees once settled in Australia, for their own and the nation\u2019s long-term success, which would involve increasing the funding and flexibility offered to those who arrive through established programs, to all those who seek Australia\u2019s protection. \u201cWhat we can see is that no real thought has been given to what is the end game when it comes to a policy like offshore processing,\u201d McAdam said. \u201cWe have people still languishing on Nauru and Manus Island after six years, with very few durable solutions in sight. And so that policy is costing billions of dollars, but also is costing people their lives in some cases, and certainly their mental health. \u201cThe levels of trauma on Manus and Nauru have been described by experts as worse than any warzone or refugee camp in the world. \u201cSo that is why the Kaldor Centre principles put forward a long-term vision, a sustainable vision, that is informed by good practices, past and present, to get Australia back on track.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
