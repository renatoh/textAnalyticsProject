Henry VIII still in power", "bodyText": "Not in person, of course. The Tudor rogue was buried in Windsor in 1547 and by all reports he remains there. But his autocratic spirit lives on in government, according to the lord chief justice of England and Wales, who delivered an elegant speech to his fellow judges on Tuesday evening, warning of the dangers lurking in so-called Henry VIII clauses. It was the kind of lecture that matters very much, but which passes most people by. In passing, the perfectly named Lord Judge pointed out that the last government introduced 2,492 laws in 2009 alone. His real target was the executive's tendency to award itself sweeping powers to rip up and rewrite acts of parliament it dislikes, under the guise of greater efficiency. These are known as Henry VIII clauses, although, as Igor Judge argued, the terms of the legislative and regulatory reform bill were more indulgent of the executive than the supine Reformation parliament's 1539 Statute of Proclamations. The bill sought to give ministers the power to amend, repeal or replace any act simply by making an official order. That usurpation of parliament was rebuffed but, as the judge warned, other acts since have had the same effect without anyone noticing. He cited the 2008 Banking Act as a particular offender; the 2010 Constitutional Reform and Governance Act is another. There is no record of all the Henry VIII powers in existence: 120 such clauses appear to have been passed in the last session of parliament alone. Even the old king must be turning in his grave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
