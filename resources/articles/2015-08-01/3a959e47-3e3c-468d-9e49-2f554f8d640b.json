Cohen, making a pre-emptive strike against culture secretary John Whittingdale\u2019s review of the size of the corporation, said the viewers love programming diversity. \u201cI believe we need a strong BBC that offers a wide range of British-made programmes \u2013 dramas, documentaries, news and entertainment,\u201d said Cohen, in a comment piece in the Radio Times. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the public want a \u2018market failure\u2019 BBC that fills the gaps by only making the kind of niche television that commercial TV simply won\u2019t make. They want a BBC that can compete with the very best the world has to offer, driving up standards and delivering for them night after night.\u201d Last month, Whittingdale announced a fundamental review of the size and scope of the BBC, inclduing questioning whether it should continue to strive to be \u201call things to all people\u201d. Whittingdale\u2019s comment fits with the view of some critics and commercial rivals who have called for the BBC to have a \u201cmarket failure\u201d remit, meaning fewer entertainment shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Voice. Cohen argued that without a strong BBC UK television could end out become too populated with US imports, and that the British public \u201cdoesn\u2019t want everything in box form\u201d. He pointed to the fact that the BBC1 schedule has no US programmes in prime time; 20 years ago this figure was 20%, yet the channel is responsible for some of the biggest hits on TV. \u201cUK viewers can relish US shows while at the same time cherishing what has made UK television different,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK public \u2026 love the variety and cultural richness of British-made television. Our viewers also tell us that they appreciate the range of stories we tell. Long series, short series and high-impact single dramas all play a critical role in this. The public doesn\u2019t want everything in box-set form.\u201d. Cohen said the corporation is a cultural \u201ccrown jewel\u201d and should be viewed as intrinsically linked to the international success of British-made TV. \u201cThe BBC is one of the crown jewels of British public and cultural life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt unifies the UK, drives the creative industries and provides stimulation, entertainment and companionship for vast numbers every day. \u201cI want a vibrant, competitive British TV sector that showcases British production companies, designers, writers and actors and boosts our economy and standing in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
