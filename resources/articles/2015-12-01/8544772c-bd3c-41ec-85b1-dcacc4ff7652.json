Louis van Gaal made a point of walking upright and greeting fans as he strode along the touchline before the start of a game billed as deciding his future at Manchester United and also potentially closing a fine career in management. Well, he could end the evening in similar proud fashion as at last his players appeared a tight, determined unit. It made the missing-in-action stuff that began with the defeat at Wolfsburg and carried through three more defeats to Saturday\u2019s reverse at Stoke City all the more puzzling. It is this yin and yang of the Dutchman that Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, and the owners, the Glazers, must decipher to decide if the 64-year-old is worth persevering with. 2 First-half display kept the home fans on side The unscientific polling service that is Twitter suggested the chap sporting a Manchester United scarf bearing the image of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was a) viewed as a traitor and b) not at the vanguard of a new craze among followers of the famous red shirt. To stop a packed Old Trafford turning on Van Gaal in the more traditional mode of boos and jeers a bright display was required. This the team delivered, particularly in a first half that was the best from United in a long time. The reinstated Wayne Rooney led the way, flipping an early pass into Juan Mata whose instant shot crashed off the bar. If the club executives were looking for signs the players can again perform for the Dutchman there was enough evidence here. The question now is: can they keep it up to put a string of convincing results together? 3 Mourinho\u2019s player management may be the x-factor required The received wisdom seems to be United will again become the Special Ones under the Special One. However, is the Portuguese not renowned for often playing the park-the-bus stuff that is the main charge levelled at Van Gaal? The big counter to that is that Mourinho, right, comes with a seemingly cast-iron guarantee of trophies and is surely a slicker man-manager than Van Gaal. The way United responded against his old team to the threat of losing a fifth straight game for the first time in 79 years suggests motivation is what has been missing. Thus if the Portuguese were to replace Van Gaal he might ensure a bunch of highly talented footballers could rediscover their mojos and the habit of winning silverware that has been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. 4 Is a quick-fix possible for United in the January transfer window? Whoever is manager come the winter transfer window\u2019s close will be a happy incumbent should a speedy striker and top-class central defender have been added. Landing Jamie Vardy and John Stones \u2013 to name two candidates \u2013 would be difficult but this is the 20-times champions, and there is a bulging trove of cash available, so why not? Virtually each time Anthony Martial took possession Chelsea shuddered as he glided at goal, the lightning forward hitting the post with one effort. United were again susceptible to the break and the defensive uncertainty was found in Louis van Gaal\u2019s decision to drop Phil Jones. If it is Mourinho in charge, maybe the groundwork he put in trying to lure Stones to Chelsea in the summer can be drawn upon in January. 5 Chelsea display shows problems run deeper than Mourinho Sixteen was the number of Premier League defeats Chelsea had handed United before the match, more than any other club, and given the west London club last lost a league fixture to United on 28 October 2012 all the omens were in Guus Hiddink\u2019s favour as he searched for the first win of his second coming at Stamford Bridge. Given any new manager can expect a bounce in effort and performance, the manner in which his side failed to click is a concern for the Dutchman and suggests that Mourinho is not solely culpable for the dismal championship defence. Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gary Cahill may have been missing but too many visiting players who did start in the XI were awol."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
