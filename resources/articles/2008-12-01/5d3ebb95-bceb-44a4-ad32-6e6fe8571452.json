Their Senate opposition to the $14bn Detroit bail-out bill under consideration on Capitol Hill on Thursday seems to have doomed it to failure after it passed in the House. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said that saving the auto industry raised questions about which industries and companies should receive aid and pointed out that there are a lot of struggling Americans \u2013 not just those tied to Detroit \u2013 who could use help. While the amount of jobs lost and money drained from the US economy will be huge if the auto industry collapses, it seems silly to prop up businesses that have been under-performing for so long. As Republican senator Richard Shelby of Alabama recently put it: \"The [Detroit] firms continue to trail their major competitors in almost every category necessary to compete.\" He confirmed what so many consumers know: When people purchase American cars, they do it out of patriotism, but they're not getting the best deal for their money. Back in 2004, my sister and I both bought used cars. Following my father's advice to \"buy American\", she bought a Ford. I listened to friends and did a little research. Lots of people were saying that Honda made the world's most reliable car, so I went for an Accord. They were both 2000 models with similar mileage on them. I'm not sure how much she spent, but mine cost about $11,000, which included taxes and some kind of multi-year insurance plan. My sister doesn't have her Ford any more. It broke down at least three times, and, thanks to what her mechanic said was some kind of design flaw, was always popping tires. After pouring tons of additional money into it, she finally sold the thing. I, on the other hand, still have my Accord. Despite the fact that I was putting a lot more miles on it than my sister was putting on her car, I haven't yet gone to the mechanic with a single problem. Do I feel bad for the people who will lose jobs if Detroit goes down? Absolutely. But I also feel bad for my sister, who doesn't make all that much money and poured a ton of cash (and stress) into a crappy car. I feel sorry for all of us who inhabit the Earth, who've suffered that much more global warming, thanks to the money-hungry leaders of Detroit. American car companies are contributing more to the climate change problem than foreign automakers. For instance, as was recently reported in the New York Times, Toyota has sold more than 600,000 Prius hybrids in the US since 2000, whereas General Motors won't start offering its Volt plug-in hybrid until 2010, when it hopes to sell a measly 10,000 of them the first year out \u2013 if it limps along until 2010, that is. I feel bad for all of us in this country who will lose money out of our pockets, in the form of taxes, to temporarily bolster an ailing industry that has not been keeping up with its competitors in terms of innovation and reliability. It speaks volumes that, as Republican senator Bob Corker of Tennessee pointed out, Cerberus, the private equity firm that owns 80% of Chrysler, has declined to invest any more of its own cash into the company. An institution with deep pockets and intimate knowledge of Chrysler doesn't want to waste any more dough on it \u2013 and yet average Americans are expected to throw money into the basket being passed around, to help save it? Note that I said \"temporarily bolster\" up above. That's one of the other problems with the bail-out: it wouldn't necessarily save the industry. Economist Mark Zandi, of Moody's Economy.com has said that Detroit could need as much as $125bn if it's really going to survive, and that the automakers could be back on Capitol Hill as soon as next fall to ask for another infusion of cash. That's cash that would be handed over to a bunch of bozos who've been making bad business decisions for years. It seems especially pathetic \u2013 not to mention clueless and arrogant twice over \u2013 that, after being lambasted by Congress for showing up on Capitol Hill to ask for aid in lavish, heavily-polluting company jets, they returned later in their newest eco-friendly motor vehicles. They might as well have stepped out of clown cars. Do they really think the memory of the American public \u2013 and American politicians \u2013 is so short? Apparently they do. Understandably, the Democrats are worried about the ripple effect that might occur if General Motors, Chrysler and Ford fail. They don't want anything like the Lehman Brothers debacle to happen again. But fixing Detroit won't make up for Lehman \u2013 and it could just buy us a lot more trouble in the long run than those companies are worth. A failure of basic common sense is what helped to bring on the mortgage crisis: people (and companies) were agreeing to make payments that they could not realistically keep up. And to take on an industry that we won't be able to keep up - which has not, itself, been keeping up - sounds like another disastrous failure of common sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
