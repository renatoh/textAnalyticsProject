In an online church service, he was apparently aiming to have an \u201chonest conversation around how racism has plagued our city for generations\u201d. Then he said: \u201cWe understand the curse that was slavery, white people do, and [we] say \u2018that was bad\u2019. But we miss the blessing of slavery, that it actually built up the framework for the world that white people live in and lived in.\u201d Giglio has since apologized for the comments. He said his wording was wrong but the sentiment was right. \u201cNot seeking to refer to slavery as a blessing \u2013 but that we are privileged because of the curse of slavery \u2026 word choice wasn\u2019t great,\u201d he said in his apology. The idea that we need to have a \u201cbalanced view\u201d on slavery is not new. It is the same argument that is rehashed every time a Confederate statue is targeted or pulled down, contrasting the historic figure\u2019s involvement with slavery with their philanthropic efforts, or their exploration feats. It is apparent in the pros and cons lists that continue to crop up whenever a slave owner is discredited: Britain\u2019s Cecil Rhodes was apparently \u201cbad\u201d for colonizing parts of Africa, but that can be balanced out by his \u201cgood\u201d \u2013 a scholarship which benefited \u201cbrilliant young students\u201d, such as Bill Clinton \u2013 or so the argument goes. White supremacists have also used that argument: witness Richard Spencer trying to tell former Guardian journalist Gary Younge that Africans benefited from white supremacy. Giglio said he wanted to help those white people who feel a \u201cfuse go off\u201d when accused of white privilege. \u201cThey don\u2019t want somebody telling them to check their privilege,\u201d he said. But to coddle those people he misses the point. Nobody needs a new term \u2013 the counter-narrative already exists. But people have often derailed meaningful conversations about race by fighting over words. It is why people argue over what the term \u201cracism\u201d actually means. Some say a hatred or dislike of a person based on their race is required for something to be racist. By that definition, only the most egregious examples count. Never mind if you\u2019re paid less for doing the same job because you\u2019re black \u2013 it\u2019s not racist if your boss thinks you\u2019re a really nice guy. Similarly, in arguments over race, the term \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d has long been used by sociologists and anti-racist activists to describe what it says on the tin: a society in which white people are seen as superior. But some take umbrage at this: most people, after all, equate \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d with the Ku Klux Klan, or the events which unfolded at Charlottesville, Virginia. But by ignoring that systemic feature of racism, it allows those who benefit from racism to wash their hands of it, maintaining a system that keeps brown and black people suppressed. Words matter, and Giglio\u2019s wording was much more than a \u201cpoor word choice\u201d. It was a powerful man trying to rebrand white privilege to make everyday racism more palatable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
