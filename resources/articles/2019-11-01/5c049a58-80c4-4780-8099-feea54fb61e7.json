Labour called on the prime minister to personally intervene to stop Anthony Browne from contesting the seat of South Cambridgeshire, saying his writings from 2002 and 2003 were \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cdespicable\u201d. In an article for the Spectator, Browne wrote: \u201cIt is not through letting in terrorists that the government\u2019s policy of mass migration \u2013 especially from the third world \u2013 will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs.\u201d He also suggested that \u201ccurbing the influx of HIV immigrants\u201d would be a better public health approach to tackling HIV than telling people to wear condoms. A book by Browne, Do We Need Mass Immigration?, attributes a catalogue of social ills and health problems to immigration. It has various passages on the same theme, saying: \u201cThe fact that African immigration has overtaken gay sex as the main cause of HIV in Britain is a sign that Europe can no longer ignore the entirely preventable Aids holocaust consuming the continent next door. But the solution is to treat the majority where they live, rather than the small number who can make it to Britain to access HIV treatment on the NHS.\u201d In a passage about Muslim leaders warning the Iraq war could cause social unrest, he wrote: \u201cWhatever the merits or demerits of war on Iraq, it is hardly a national strength to have a large minority with such divided loyalties during war.\u201d Browne, a former lobbyist for the British Bankers\u2019 Association and journalist for the Times and Observer, addressed some of the comments when he became a policy director when Johnson was mayor of London, saying he had gone through a \u201cphase of being deliberately contrary and deliberately provocative\u201d. He said at the time: \u201cI do very much regret any offence caused by any past newspaper articles. It really never was my intention to cause offence, but to provoke debate. The articles, which I deeply regret writing, also don\u2019t give a fair reflection of my views. I want to make clear that I am emphatically not anti-immigration.\u201d Naz Shah, the shadow women and equalities minister, said: \u201cThis is disgusting racism. It\u2019s shocking that someone with such despicable views has been selected to stand for the Conservative party. \u201cGiven his personal relationship with Anthony Browne, Boris Johnson should personally intervene and remove him as a candidate.\u201d Lady Warsi, a former co-chair of the Conservative party, said the comments were racist and argued that losing the seat\u2019s former MP, Heidi Allen, to the Lib Dems and having her replaced by Browne \u201cperfectly illustrates where we\u2019ve gone wrong as Conservatives\u201d. The Liberal Democrat candidate for South Cambridgeshire, Ian Sollom, said they were \u201cabhorrent remarks\u201d. \u201cThe fact that the Conservative party are now being represented by candidates like this shows just how divisive and extreme they have become,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should urgently consider whether Anthony Browne is a suitable candidate to represent their party in light of these remarks.\u201d A Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cThese comments were made over 15 years ago, Anthony Browne has apologised for these comments and sincerely regrets them.\u201d Browne did not respond to requests for comment. Candidates from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems have all come in for criticism over past comments since the election started, with at least two Tories and one Labour standing down. On Monday night, the Liberal Democrat candidate for Thurrock, Kevin McNamara, issued an apology and stood down after the party launched an investigation into posts made to his social media allegedly involving homophobic and racist slurs. Plum seats for Tory advisers Browne is one of a string of political advisers with links to Johnson\u2019s administration who have landed or are in the running for safe or key target seats for the Tories at the election. One of Johnson\u2019s current policy chiefs, Danny Kruger, has won the race to stand in the safe Wiltshire seat of Devizes and James Wild, a senior special adviser to the prime minister, is seeking selection for another safe Tory seat, West Norfolk. Andrew Griffith, a business adviser to the prime minister and former Sky executive who lent Johnson a \u00a39.5m house during his leadership campaign, won the selection in Arundel and South Downs on Monday night. Dominic Raab\u2019s special adviser, Simon Jupp, is standing in East Devon and Claire Coutinho, an adviser to Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is standing in East Surrey. Several former advisers from previous No 10 regimes have also been selected, including Laura Trott, a former adviser to David Cameron, Mario Creatura, a former adviser to Theresa May, Paul Holmes, who worked for the former party chair Patrick McLoughlin, and Anthony Mangnall, a former aide to William Hague. Others have not yet been successful at getting seats, including Nick Timothy, May\u2019s former co-chief of staff who was behind her disastrous 2017 manifesto, and Rupert Harrison, a former aide to George Osborne, both of whom were in the running for Devizes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
