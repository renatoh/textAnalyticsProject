Despite its embarrassing title, The Treason Show is just the kind of beast that will make the break. Right from the opening bars of the fearlessly bang-on We're the Israelites it is clear that this is a funny and feral animal, one that never passes a shot at the solar plexus. In one sketch, the government finally bows to public pressure and reforms its policy on refugees. Pinochet and Milosevic are given asylum and new identities in Liverpool as Robert Thompson and Jon Venables: \"And remember to introduce yourselves to the neighbours.\" In Bed With Gordon Brown is just as savagely funny, and when Ffion Hague breaks her post-election silence it isn't pretty. This is cut with some fantastically silly stuff, including Michael Portillo's debut with the Chippendales and, most poignant of all, Charles Kennedy singing Yellow: \"I have a dream/ a dream I never see/ the country's run by me . . . \" At an hour and a half - I lost count after 30 or so sketches - this is one of Edinburgh's longest comedy shows, yet the buttock-ometer, the most reliable critic of all, is untroubled. \u0095 Until August 26. Box office: 0131-667 2212. Komedia Southside"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
