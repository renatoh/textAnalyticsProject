Eighteen months after the celebrations of Sir Colin Davis's seventy-fifth birthday, an extended bash has just begun for (honorary Sir) Bernard Haitink's. Next year will no doubt see similar festivities as Sir Charles Mackerras turns 80. Each maestro is, remarkably, at the peak of his powers. Or merely, perhaps, approaching them? Toscanini and Klemperer both conducted well into their eighties; Stokowski signed a 10-year recording contract on his ninetieth birthday. Or, to put it another way, we ain't really heard nothing yet from sub-50 stripling, Sir Simon Rattle. Dutch-born Haitink has devoted a huge slice of his professional life to this country, earning a devoted following here with 18 years at the Royal Opera, 10 at Glyndebourne, 12 with the LPO. His CV also shows a 40-year association with the Royal Concertgebouw in his native Amsterdam, including 25 as its principal conductor. So it seemed fitting that this was the first of five major orchestras he will bring to the Barbican over the coming months to celebrate a birthday he says he doesn't 'want to think about too much'. The Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics will soon follow, plus the LSO and, finally, the Dresden Staatskapelle, of which he recently became music director 50 years after starting out as a violinist in the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, and taking charge of the Concertgebouw within a decade. Mahler will be a recurrent theme, as befits a musician who was among the first to familiarise London audiences with his music in the Sixties, along with Shostakovich and Bruckner, both of whom figured in the Concertgebouw's visit. Haitink chose four iconic but very different works to show off the full range of the Concertgebouw's remarkable palette of orchestral colours: Debussy and Shostakovich on the first evening, Mozart and Bruckner the following afternoon. When Andras Schiff joined this noticeably young orchestra for Mozart's great D minor concerto, the maestro was perhaps too content to sit back a bit, leaving the soloist to run the show more than pure Mozartians might have wished. The result, while it would have pleased Beethoven, saw the work's dark profundities less than usually relieved by its filigree charms. As for Bruckner's titanic ninth symphony: this was a majestic performance from a conductor seasoned enough to know precisely how to marry a composer's trademark soundscape to his orchestra's distinctive skills. The result was a long, harrowing journey, the strings richly translucent, the wind crystal-clear and powerful, the percussion explosive - and Bruckner himself seeming less of a drama queen that he so often can. At the end of his self-imposed marathon, this massive piece concluding two huge programmes in less than 24 hours, poor Haitink looked understandably shattered. And there's a long way to go yet even if, as he gnomically says of his three-quarter-century: 'The future will be shorter than the past.' Unlike most conductors, some opera productions show their age long before they are consigned to history. One notable exception is Nicholas Hytner's 16-year-old staging of The Magic Flute for ENO. A certain period cutesiness at the expense of the work's majesty and mystery does not much impinge on an evening of musical and theatrical delight. A startlingly phallic serpent, real doves flying about for Papageno, a pack of bears menacing Tamino: for all its Eighties chic, Hytner's box of tricks remains as charming as ever. Musically, this version is equally satisfying, with Toby Spence in eloquent voice as a handsome, fresh-faced Tamino and Carolyn Sampson an affecting if occasionally strident Pamina. The rambling rural accent of Toby Stafford-Allen's otherwise well-rounded Papageno is straight out of The Archers, which seems appropriate enough, with a Papagena as alluring as Sarah Tynan to keep him on the straight and narrow. With a Sarastro as imposing as Brindley Sherratt, a comb-over Monostatos as Dickensian as Alasdair Elliott, and a conductor with as sure a period feel (and sparkle) as Nicholas Kraemer, this is a staging as fresh and polished as ever, ready to run for years yet. Even Jeremy Sams's demotic translation was largely audible, not least because so much is spoken dialogue. It may have needed taking out of mothballs, but this is the perfect gauntlet to throw in the path of Raymond Gubbay as he fast approaches the nearby Savoy Theatre, laden with more such mainstream, bums-on-seats fare. Organs don't, it seems, go on forever; they need expensively regular refurbishment. The Royal Festival Hall's mighty Harrison &amp; Harrison instrument has required several overhauls during its half-century of pomp and premieres, celebrated last week with the fourth and last in a series of mega-recitals to mark its fiftieth birthday. Soon, as part of the RFH's renovation, this venerable machine will be dismantled and reconstructed to aid the hall's new acoustic, emerging, we are assured, in better form than ever. Reason not the need, for it was sounding mighty impressive on Tuesday, as Thomas Trotter opened the celebratory evening with the characteristic mix of introspection and pyrotechnics that makes up Samuel Barber's Toccata Festiva . With the LPO fighting gamely to make as much noise under David Hill, John Scott then expertly milked the many moods of Poulenc's G minor concerto for organ and timpani. Nicholas Kynaston caressed as much contemplative charm out of Respighi's G major suite as he generated glorious grandeur. And Dame Gillian Weir closed the show in high style with the thunderous finale to Alexandre Guilmant's first symphony for organ and orchestra. In the RFH, it was standing room only; a thrilled audience of organistas seemed to have come from all over the country. Not since the recent visit of Brian Wilson has this hall throbbed and vibrated to the palpable delight of so many expert enthusiasts, nor its roof seemed in such imminent danger of involuntary elevation.
