Since NatWest withdrew its services late last year, the animal testing firm has been forced to rely on the Bank of England for an account, as other institutions are terrified of protesters. The government has been working with the Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry to persuade high-street banks to get back involved. The ABPI and the Department of Trade and Industry say they have been making steady progress. Unfortunately, one newspaper yesterday reported that Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays had indicated a willingness to help. All three banks promptly ran screaming for the hills, issuing terse statements denying any contact. One industry source complained that when they were all in a room together, a sense of bravado made bankers promise to help Huntingdon. As soon as they went out into the open air, the same bankers defaulted to cowardice. The arguments surrounding Huntingdon are well rehearsed. The company provides essential services testing drugs on animals, in trials which are required by law for all new medicines. A television documentary filmed errant employees mistreating beagles four years ago. Those responsible were dismissed, the company's management was changed and the firm has been praised in inspections ever since. Huntingdon is a legitimate business, which suffers harassment from a tiny cell of thugs wielding bricks and baseball bats. Greg Avery, the oft-quoted spokesman for Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, is up before the beak next month along with his former wife and another friend, charged with conspiracy to incite violence. Britain's banks claim their reluctance to help is a commercial decision - one said Huntingdon was \"basically bust\". But the company last month announced improving results, with orders up 12%. Plenty of worse risks, including Railtrack, have been treated sympathetically. If Stephens Group of Arkansas can offer Huntingdon backing to the tune of \u00a310m, the \"bank that likes to say yes\" should have the guts to provide a bank account. Ad minus At the southern end of London's Southwark Bridge, staff at the Financial Times are watching as the second half of the planned FT Campus goes up floor by floor on the other side of the road. It was conceived during the great dot.com mania to help house hundreds of FT.commers as well as providing suitable offices for chief executive Stephen Hill and his entourage. Pearson, the FT's parent, remains as committed as ever to cyberspace. But the associated costs must be close to unbearable. During the boom, publishers could spend pretty well what they wanted on new media since they were raking in so much extra revenue from dot.advertisers. The internet looked like a giant cash call for established media corporations as venture capitalists provided massive funds to modernise these old businesses via the vehicle of dot.com start-ups. That is no longer the case. Advertising industry estimates suggest that between April and August this year, revenue from recruitment advertising at the FT was down just over 37% year-on-year. At the Daily Telegraph the figure was 34%, while at the Sunday Times (which was laying off staff yesterday) the fall was a shocking 49%. In display advertising the Telegraph is believed to have dropped 17% and the Sunday Times by 19%, while the FT was off 31%. For all types of advertising the figures were 15.5% for the Telegraph, 21% for the Sunday Times and 29% for the FT. Note that these figures are historical - running to the end of the summer. The further sharp falls in advertising after September 11 are evident to anyone who picks up one of these products. Now, Pearson is not quite in the same leaky boat as the venerable Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, which put out its own dreadful numbers yesterday and warned that the final quarter of the year would be even worse than everyone was expecting. With its education and book businesses standing alongside the newspaper division, Pearson has achieved an attractive balance of diversity and focus under its widely-admired chief executive, Marjorie Scardino. But the fall in advertising revenues at the FT appears to be much heavier than the City's analytical community realises. For example, a recent research note from Merrill Lynch (downgrading the stock because of the fall in advertising) estimated a 17% fall in ad revenues during the second half of 2001. If our figures are closer to the truth than those from Merrill Lynch, it may be that Pearson should own up to the true state of trading."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
