Anyway, here I am again recommending that the boys experiment with a splash of colour for summer. There's more to a wardrobe than navy, grey and beige, and anyone who thinks suiting is dull should visit the new British Tailoring Room at Harrods. Harrods has found a way to improve every man's closet. It's created a section filled with the best of British men's tailoring. The refurbished section is bright and sleek, and well-known labels such as Vivienne Westwood, Paul Smith, Richard James, Timothy Everest and Oswald Boateng share the floor with newer labels such as Oliver Spencer and Holland Esquire. Only a couple of weeks ago Rod Stewart bought an Oswald Boateng blue and mauve suit, which he wore to propose to Penny Lancaster - now, there's a man who has never been afraid to wear colour. 'I wanted to bring together the best modern British tailoring talent that has emerged in recent years and showcase their products through a unique lifestyle area,' explains Nick O'Donnell, buyer for the room. 'An environment has been created where more affordable pieces mix comfortably with bespoke tailoring, offering something for everyone.' One of the most popular labels is Holland Esquire, tailoring with a twist, a denim-effect raw-edge suit jacket with a ribbon trim which costs less than \u00a3300. Next door is the Timothy Everest semi-bespoke range, which features tailored check jackets and coats. And my day is made when I spot Oliver Spencer's baby pink - yes, pink - flak jacket. I will be keeping an eye out for sartorial developments in the newsroom. jo.adams@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
