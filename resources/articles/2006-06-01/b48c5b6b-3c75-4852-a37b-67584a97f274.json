I started off by taking vitamins C and E, and calcium and magnesium together - the calcium isn't assimilated into your body unless you take it with magnesium. Now I also take glucosamine, as one knee is a little worn away, and it seems to keep it in check. I take zinc - I forget why - and a multi-vitamin. Do you prefer healthy food or fast food? I am strictly a healthy food person and try not to eat anything that's packaged. Have you ever dieted? I don't think I have ever dieted. I periodically watch what I eat, but I have a pretty comprehensive diet. Do you exercise? I still exercise a lot. I try to play tennis three times a week and, at this level, it is pretty aerobic, so I will play for maybe an hour and 15 minutes, which is plenty. And it's a really good workout. On other days, I always do something like walking. Do you drink alcohol? I really enjoy wine, and I probably have some most days. I am fairly moderate - I could probably drink less, but fortunately I don't tend to overdrink, because I know how easy it is to do that. I don't think there's anything wrong with drinking a bit. The Eastbourne International Tennis Championships, sponsored by Hastings Direct Motor Insurance, start today (eastbourne.lta.org.uk).
