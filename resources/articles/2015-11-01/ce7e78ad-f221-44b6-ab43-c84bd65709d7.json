Not only did they kick off Pool 4 of the European Champions\u2019 Cup with a bonus point win over the champions of France but they also appear to have made one of the season\u2019s shrewder signings in Brendon O\u2019Connor, an energetic English-qualified openside flanker straight from Kiwi central casting. Along with the classy Owen Williams at fly-half and the unrelated Zimbabwean lock Mike Williams, the newly-arrived debutant O\u2019Connor was at the heart of a sharply-improved Tigers display that yielded four tries and showcased the home side\u2019s desire to play a more ambitious brand of rugby under their new head coach Aaron Mauger. If the precision and accuracy of their passing is not yet wholly reliable there is already a refreshing difference in attitude. Their director of rugby Richard Cockerill had demanded a significantly-improved display following last Saturday\u2019s mediocre effort in Exeter and it duly materialised. If the quality was still nowhere near the level of the epic 2001 final in Paris between these two sides, Cockerill rightly hailed it \u201ca really good start\u201d and was suitably encouraged by Stade\u2019s failure to secure a losing bonus point. Stade, admittedly, were not the full pink panther on the team-sheet, lacking Willem Alberts, Will Genia and a clutch of other prominent forwards. They did at least boast the great Sergio Parisse and the veteran France lock Pascale Pap\u00e9 but bore only a fleeting resemblance to the team crowned last season\u2019s Top 14 winners. Leicester were also a side transformed from Sandy Park last weekend, having trained in the evening this week to acclimatise. They began promisingly, with Peter Betham having a potential first quarter try ruled out following a huge obstruction in midfield by Marcos Ayerza. The visitors\u2019 luck, however, did not last long. Julien Dupuy, the former Tiger back on familiar turf, was carried off with a knee injury after a mere quarter of an hour and there was a momentary danger of Stade\u2019s composure and tactical zip going with him. Few French sides, though, are ever entirely predictable and, out of nowhere, a wonderful passing sequence involving half a dozen different pairs of hands ended with Dupuy\u2019s replacement, Julien Tomas, scoring in the right corner. When the Tigers then butchered a five on two overlap and Morn\u00e9 Steyn landed a monster 52-metre penalty to put his side 8-0 ahead, Leicester felt a temporary unease. In O\u2019Connor, however, they have a more than useful new addition qualified for England via a grandmother. The 26-year-old former captain of Hawke\u2019s Bay is also a good enough cricketer to have represented Northern Districts back home but it is his breakdown skills that will swiftly endear him to Tigers supporters. In this instance a neat steal dispossessed Parisse and created the turnover from which Niki Goneva finally broke the hosts\u2019 duck. \u201cHe\u2019s highly rated in New Zealand but they have a few other good 7s,\u201d said Cockerill. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit premature to talk about him playing for England but he\u2019ll be good for us.\u201d When Matt Smith added a second a minute before half-time to make it 12-8, the referee having ignored an apparent knock-on in the build-up, the mood brightened substantially. Things improved even further within a minute of the restart, a fumble from the Stade full-back Bonneval allowing O\u2019Connor to sprint 45 metres for a score awarded despite a less-than-subtle blocking line run by Adam Thompstone that prevented any chance of Steyn making a saving tackle. While Stade did get a try back through Paul Williams, Leicester had the bonus point safely wrapped up after 55 minutes courtesy of a quickly-taken tap penalty and close-range dart from Ben Youngs. They may have played Save All Your Kisses For Me by Brotherhood of Man over the public address before kick-off but, on the field, the new-look Tigers made a thoroughly modern, up-tempo impression.
