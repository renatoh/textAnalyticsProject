A maths degree from Oxbridge meant you were more than qualified for any career you chose. It meant you were up to anything, someone to be respected and guaranteed to do well. These days, however, there is much more emphasis on portfolio than provenance. Graduates are realising that in some creative areas not only does a light or dark-blue degree not fling open the doors it once did ... it might actually be seen as a disadvantage. According to the Sutton Trust, 81% of current judges have Oxbridge degrees and it may still be true that big City firms take notice of the colour of your scarf or look favourably on your ability to punt. But in creative arts jobs, more and more Oxbridge graduates are finding themselves scraping the mould off last week's bread in an attempt to make ends meet. Sarah Shore, a theology graduate from Cambridge, is realising the hard way that the streets aren't paved with gold. \"I think there is an assumption that a decent degree from a university such as Cambridge will guarantee you a job, even if it's not your dream job, and that this will pay enough to afford to live,\" she says. \"Frankly, on my current salary, by the time I've paid my rent and bills, there is precious little left for basics such as food. \"These sorts of jobs are not enormously well-paid - especially at the lowest level where the vast majority of graduates, myself included, have to start. Most employers offer the option of enrolling on a pension scheme, but we are unable to afford to match the employer contribution and subsequently lose out on the amount they would have put in for us.\" Moreover, says Shore, \"the types of skills required for working in the arts world are not necessarily academic. If someone wanted to work in the arts world I wouldn't say it was essential, or even necessarily preferable , to have gone to Oxbridge.\" However, Shore says that she is happy in her work. \"I decided on a career in the arts because this is what I am most interested in, and I would prefer to be in a low-paid job which I enjoyed than in a highly paid job I didn't. In comparison with some of my peers, I am earning a pathetic salary but I am doing something that directly benefits people and that, from my point of view, is more meaningful than some of the highly paid banking jobs.\" Research from insurance group JLT Benefit Solutions recently found that many 25- to 34-year-olds are also looking ahead with concern, with 47% of those surveyed more worried about pensions now than they were five years ago. Yet many are unable to afford a company pension scheme. Duncan Howarth, managing director of JLT's pension division, says: \"Government and companies alike should recognise that a good education alone is no safeguard against long-term poverty.\" Howarth also admits that as an employer, he has an instinctive reaction to an Oxbridge applicant. \"I think some of the other universities have substantially improved their quality over past few years,\" he says, \"And, though I am generalising somewhat, I find that the Oxbridge types do not always have the broadest set of skills. The regional universities often produce a graduate with a broader outlook.\" One of the main reasons that Oxbridge degrees are no longer a guarantee of financial stability is that highly desirable jobs in fields such as journalism, television and design pay poorly relative to starting wages in other fields and there is more competition in these areas. Oxbridge graduates are finding themselves competing against those with all-singing, all-dancing multimedia degrees from post-medieval institutions. Phil Drew, 22, who works for a London-based PR firm, read English at Sydney Sussex College, Cambridge. Drew believes that \"the old boy networks, which meant you'd automatically get what and where you wanted, simply by having 'Cantab' after your name, is a thing of the Victorian past. Graduates from Cambridge compete for a shrinking number of posts just like everyone else.\" Pensions are also a worry for Drew, some of whose friends \"receive my annual salary as a Christmas bonus\". He says: \"I have other friends in small, startup creative companies and we're all a bit worried. People are living longer, which means we need to save more. The state pension seems to take more from us in tax than it gives us in later life.\" Drew says that when he began at Cambridge there was an assumption that they would all be set for life. \"Except when you get out into the Big Scary World, there is no 'all' - you're on your own- and what's more, there's no guarantee that you're going to end up 'OK' any more. It's worrying.\" Ben Please is 27 and a Cambridge natural sciences graduate. He is currently working as a freelance musician and \"looking for work\". Until recently he had been working with an ex-BBC natural history producer to set up an environmental charity in east Africa. Please says: \"It was a subsistence job in terms of money but I was grateful to be doing something creative and interesting. Since mid-2006 I have been taking occasional freelance editing work, which allows me to subsist and devote more time to music.\" While he says that at Cambridge things such as accommodation were good value, he remembers there being odd little expenses that seemed unnecessary. \"As a student you really don't want to spend your valuable money on a gown.\" And despite having had a great time at university, Please also reckons: \"If I had studied the same degree, met the same people and made the same choices, but my degree was from a former polytechnic, I don't believe it would make any difference to my career now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
