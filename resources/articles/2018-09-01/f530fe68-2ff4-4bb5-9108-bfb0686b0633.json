An extraordinary general meeting will be held in Salford on Friday to determine not only whether to end the Super 8s league format this year, but also to decide how key financing is distributed beyond the current television deal, which expires at the end of 2021. The Super League clubs \u2013 with the exception of Leeds \u2013 are in favour of reverting to a one-up, one-down promotion format between the top tier and the Championship. The majority of the lower leagues, however, are concerned that any change will result in significantly less funding for the rest of the game from 2022 onwards. Super League has committed to allocating at least 80% of the annual \u00a310m currently distributed to the RFL, Championship and League 1 if the new broadcast deal matches the current \u00a336m per annum figure. However, several Championship chairmen have accused the RFL and Super League of bullying vulnerable lower-league clubs into voting with them at the EGM. \u201cThey [the RFL] need to stand up and be the governing body,\u201d the Featherstone owner, Mark Campbell, said. \u201cThey\u2019ve sat on the fence and they\u2019ve worked with Super League underhandedly in cajoling clubs to vote on way or the other. I think it\u2019s respectable with what\u2019s happening in regards to bullying \u2013 they have had a part in that.\u201d Championship and League 1 clubs say that if the TV deal falls by any percentage, the amount Super League receives will remain unaffected. They, instead, are calling for the entire sport\u2019s distribution to fall or rise together, rather than the RFL and lower leagues suffer a harsher fall in funding which they believe could lead to a potentially disastrous financial outlook for the game outside Super League. A total of 55 votes will be cast, with a simple 28-27 majority needed to pass the proposals \u2013 which requires four Championship and/or League 1 sides to vote with Super League. Lower-league clubs have accused top-flight sides of trying to financially motivate smaller clubs into voting in favour. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a low point here,\u201d Batley\u2019s owner, Kevin Nicholas, said. \u201cA Championship club [who the group of chairmen assembled refused to name] have been told that if they don\u2019t vote in favour of the proposals, there will be no dual-registration agreement and they won\u2019t be able to share training facilities. That is sinking pretty low.\u201d Castleford overcame the absence of Luke Gale and stiff resistance from Huddersfield to keep their home semi-final hopes alive with a fourth successive win on Thursday night. Forward Junior Moors was the star of the show with two tries as the Tigers came from 12-4 down to win 44-12 and keep the pressure on second-placed Wigan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
