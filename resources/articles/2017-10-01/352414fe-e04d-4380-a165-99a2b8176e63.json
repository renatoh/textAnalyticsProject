Top stories The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has asked the Catalan government a simple question that may have a very complicated answer: have you declared independence, or not? On Tuesday evening, the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, said while the referendum this month had given his government a mandate to create a sovereign republic, he would \u201csuspend the effects of the independence declaration\u201d for a few weeks to give both sides a chance to talk. But the move has been met with confusion and frustration from Madrid and Rajoy has refused to rule out taking the unprecedented step of suspending the region\u2019s autonomy and imposing direct rule from Madrid. Rajoy also rejected calls for the dispute to be mediated by external partners, insisting the Catalan question remained a domestic matter. \u201cThe cabinet has agreed this morning to formally require the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared independence after the deliberate confusion created over whether it has come into effect,\u201d he said in a television address on Wednesday. \u201cIf Mr Puigdemont demonstrates a willingness to respect the law and re-establish institutional normality, we could bring a close to a period of instability, tension and the breakdown of co-existence.\u201d Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s Labor government in Queensland is in front of its Liberal National party rivals, with One Nation polling 13%, the latest Guardian Essential poll finds. The coming Queensland election will be a key marker of One Nation\u2019s performance and will be closely watched given its federal implications and the number of marginal federal seats in the state. The poll also suggested the Nick Xenophon group was attracting 18% of the vote in South Australia before Xenophon revealed his decision late last week to return to state politics to contest the state election next March. Sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein continue to mount after his wife announced she was leaving him and his most powerful allies, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, expressed disgust at his actions. Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the Marchesa luxury brand and the mother of two of Weinstein\u2019s children, said she was ending her 10-year marriage to the producer. \u201cMy heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions.\u201d Weinstein said he understood his wife\u2019s desire to separate. In an article for the Guardian, the actor L\u00e9a Seydoux has told for the first time of having to fight off Weinstein\u2019s advances in a Paris hotel room. Meanwhile Ben Affleck has apologised for groping the actor Hilarie Burton during an appearance on MTV\u2019s Total Request Live in 2003. Burton criticised Affleck on Twitter shortly after he had released a statement condemning producer Weinstein for alleged acts of sexual harassment and abuse. Labor has released a policy to address the potential risks of flammable cladding in Australia in the wake of the Grenfell fire in London. Labor will create a national licensing scheme for builders and installers, and a new penalties regime for people who breach the national construction code, as part of efforts to boost fire safety standards in buildings. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, says the current regulatory and enforcement regime is \u201cbroken\u201d, and national action is needed to improve compliance with the building code, including toughening up penalties. A British woman and three Australians have been briefly detained by vigilantes, amid mass panic in Indian-administered Kashmir over a spate of alleged \u201cbraid choppings\u201d. Police in the Himalayan region say they have reports of at least 40 instances of women\u2019s hair being forcibly cut by unidentified assailants. The incidents have sparked mob violence and mass protests, and some young women in the region say they are too afraid to leave their homes. The first alleged incidents were reported the southern districts of the disputed state but have now spread to its capital, Srinagar. Police are at a loss to explain the alleged crimes but have doubled the reward for information about the culprits to 600,000 rupees (\u00a37,000). Sport Australia has retained the Constellation Cup with a victory over New Zealand last night in Adelaide. The Diamonds beat the Silver Ferns 55-43, with Australia now leading the series 3-0, with one game to play. Nick Kyrgios has been stripped of his first-round prize money and fined an additional $10,000 after his controversial retirement after losing the first set in the Shanghai Masters. Kyrgios had become increasingly unhappy with the umpire Fergus Murphy. He later blamed a stomach bug but did not seek medical help on court. Thinking time Journalist Katy Tur\u2019s new book, Unbelievable, covers the \u201cever-deepening weirdness\u201d that developed between her and Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign. In this extended extract Tur recounts the bizarre nature of her first interview with the future president and his changeable mood and word salad. \u201cTrump Tower is a black, mirrored skyscraper that takes up half a block. The main entrance is campy, with an old-fashioned clock and white-gloved doormen in tails and gold-trimmed hats. More Disney than Dakota. Hope Hicks appears, smiles, and gives us a two-minute warning. Trump is on his way. Don\u2019t look nervous.\u201d Josh Frydenberg, the energy minister, signalled on Monday that the government will abandon the clean energy target. It confirmed that the chance of bipartisan energy legislation passing before the next election went to zero. But Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court writes that polls show that Australians, regardless of their political stripes, want more renewables, and argues that the economic case for them has been won and the shift to clean energy is locked in. Greg Jericho reads between the lines of the IMF\u2019s latest global economic forecast, where it tackles stubbornly low wages growth across all advanced economies with surprisingly radical suggestions. \u201cIn an era of highly flexible employment with increasing levels of part-time work, governments need to protect and extend minimum wages and also look at changing unemployment benefits to acknowledge that the era of full-time work being standard is in the past.\u201d What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has ramped up his war with the news media, suggesting that it might be appropriate to challenge the licence of NBC News in response to what he claimed was its \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cWith all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!\u201d Trump tweeted overnight. \u201cFake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a \u2018tenfold\u2019 increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!\u201d Media roundup Fairfax Media reports that a hacker codenamed Alf\u201d stole commercially sensitive information about a number of defence force projects, including the $14bn dollar joint strike fighter program. The NT News front page is devoted to a horse that has been shot with a bow and arrow in a \u201csickening\u201d attack in Darwin. And the ABC talks to a US academic who has attacked Australia\u2019s plan to have Naplan English writing tests marked by a robot, beginning next year. Coming up Today is the last day of citizenship hearings at the court of disputed returns in Canberra with submissions from One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts being heard. The stakes of the case can be read here. Services will be held to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Bali bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians.
