In a blogpost, CEO Brian Chesky called discrimination \u201cthe greatest challenge we face as a company\u201d and conceded that he and his cofounders were not \u201cfully conscious of this issue when we designed the platform\u201d and that \u201cthere have at times been a lack of urgency to work on this\u201d. Holder, the nation\u2019s first black attorney general, has spoken openly about racism he experienced \u2013 including being racially profiled by police while serving as a federal prosecutor. As attorney general, he fought to preserve the Voting Rights Act, despite the 2013 supreme court ruling that gutted the civil rights-era legal protections for black voters. Referencing the company\u2019s support for Black Lives Matter, as well as for \u201cbrave police officers\u201d, Cheskey provided the most information to date about Airbnb\u2019s plan to \u201cget our house in order\u201d. A review of the platform is being overseen by former ACLU official Laura Murphy, and the company said it will task Holder and civil rights attorney John Relman with improving its anti-discrimination policy. Holder said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with Airbnb to develop and implement a world-class anti-discrimination policy. I\u2019m eager to help them craft policies that will be the model for companies who share Airbnb\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion.\u201d Airbnb has come under fire in recent months as users have spoken out about their experiences of discrimination on the platform, including black users who shared their struggles to find rentals using the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack and a transgender woman who revealed that she had been rejected by one of the company\u2019s \u201csuperhosts\u201d. A 2015 study by Harvard Business School researchers found evidence of \u201cwidespread discrimination against African-American guests\u201d on the platform. Federal civil rights law bars hotels and other public accommodations from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, but it is as yet unclear whether those rules apply to Airbnb and other short-term rental companies that do not operate lodgings themselves. Airbnb\u2019s current policy tells hosts that they are required to comply with local laws, including, in the US, federal anti-discrimination laws. When the new policy is in place, Chesky said, hosts will be required to \u201cread and certify\u201d that they will comply. In addition to potential legal liability, Airbnb has faced market pressure over discrimination. Black entrepreneurs recently founded two startups, Noirbnb and Innclusive, that would cater to people of color and other travelers who might face discrimination on Airbnb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
