It's back on the big screen as a result of the success here of Bergman's latest and, he says, last film, Saraband, also made for TV. Saraband is a sombre chamber movie, a string quartet of a picture for four actors. Fanny and Alexander is a family epic, a symphonic piece for a large cast. The film begins with a marvellously sustained Christmas party sequence in 1907 at the home of a wealthy ex-actress in what is clearly the university city of Uppsala and comes to focus on the almost Dickensian life of her grandchildren when their actor-father suddenly dies and their mother marries a puritanical bishop. Performed by Bergman regulars, the film has much that is autobiographical about it and involves a contest between theatre and church, between magic and dull diurnal reality. During its three hours, seasons come and go, friends and relatives gather for funerals, weddings and christenings, and all human life is here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
