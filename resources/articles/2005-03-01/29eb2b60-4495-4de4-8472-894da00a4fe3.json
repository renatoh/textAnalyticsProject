Sound on crosses. Paulo Ferreira: 6 Tried to stay tight on Ronaldinho on the right and did pretty well but conceded the penalty. Substituted. John Terry: 6 Not his best game defensively but got the decisive goal. Found it hard sometimes to cope with Barcelona's movement. Ricardo Carvalho: 7 Some fine interventions, including a last-ditch tackle in the box on Eto'o, outweighed a handful of errors. William Gallas: 6 Rarely beaten and made a good interception but distribution can be poor with his left foot. Rarely came forward. Claude Makelele: 6 Tireless and made some good interceptions but could not provide a proper shield in difficult circumstances. Joe Cole: 8 Strong, disciplined and effective. Showed good skill and doggedness on the right, setting up two goals and hitting a post. Frank Lampard: 8 A constant source of aggression and attacking menace. His tackle prompted Chelsea's first and he scored their second. Damien Duff: 6 Not a prominent attacking figure, but scored Chelsea's third goal and his corner led to the fourth. Worked hard. Mateja Kezman: 6 Began explosively, crossing for the first goal and helping in the third with a nice lay-off. But later starved of ball. Eidur Gudjohnsen: 6 Started excellently, scoring the opening goal and both prompting and helping defensively from deep, but faded. Substitutes Glen Johnson: (Ferreira, 51). Made a couple of mistakes but nothing costly. Booked. 6 Robert Huth: (Duff, 86) Tiago: (Gudjohnsen, 79)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
