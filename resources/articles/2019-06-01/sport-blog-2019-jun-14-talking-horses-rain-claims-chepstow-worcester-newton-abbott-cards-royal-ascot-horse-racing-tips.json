Fleeting\u2019s addition to the field for the Group Two contest took bookmakers and punters by surprise, and having been unquoted for the race by most firms overnight, she was introduced to the betting at 9-2 before shortening to a top price of 7-2, half a point behind Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s Queen Power at the head of the market. O\u2019Brien has been the leading trainer at the Royal meeting for the last four seasons and nine times in all, and while his lifetime score of 65 winners is still 14 winners adrift of Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s record total of 79, O\u2019Brien will hope to close the gap, perhaps to single figures, over the five days next week. His first Royal winner, Harbour Master in the Coventry Stakes in 1997, arrived 20 years after Stoute broke his duck in 1977. Friday\u2019s six-race card, in which O\u2019Brien will saddle short-priced favourites in both of the day\u2019s Group One races, could prove particular rewarding. In addition to Hermosa, the 1,000 Guineas winner, in the Coronation Stakes and Ten Sovereigns in the Commonwealth Cup, the stable also has the market leaders for the Albany Stakes and King Edward VII Stakes earlier in the afternoon. Ten Sovereigns set off as the favourite for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in early May but appeared to be beaten by lack of stamina, fading to finish fifth after travelling as well as any of his opponents until a furlong out. \u201cWe were delighted with Ten Sovereigns in the Guineas and we were always thinking in our mind that we would run him in the Guineas and then bring him back for this race,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to getting him back over six furlongs. He travelled so well in the Guineas but this was the trip he was very comfortable at last year, so you\u2019d imagine he\u2019ll be happy.\u201d Ten Sovereigns is a 7-4 chance for the Commonwealth Cup while Hermosa is even shorter in the betting for the Coronation Stakes at 5-4. O\u2019Brien\u2019s other market leaders in Group One events are Le Brivido, at 9-2 for the Queen Anne Stakes which opens the meeting, and Magical, the 7-2 favourite for Wednesday\u2019s feature race, the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes, while the last two winners of the St Leger will represent him in Thursday\u2019s Gold Cup. \u201cLe Brivido ran a very good race in the Lockinge [at Newbury in mid-May],\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cRyan [Moore] just said that he got caught up in traffic at a bad time when the race was just getting going. \u201cMagical has done everything right so far this season and has won three races. Last year we were getting her ready for the Oaks but she had a setback which meant we had to go gentle for a lot of the year with her. She started to get it together before [Champions Day at] Ascot where she won the Fillies\u2019 and Mares\u2019 and then she went to [the Breeders\u2019 Cup in] American were she was just beaten by [dual Arc winner] Enable.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s record haul from a single Royal meeting is seven winners, in 2016. Four victories were enough to see him finish as the week\u2019s top trainer 12 months ago when, unusually, none of his winners set off as the favourite and while Order Of St George, Winter, Caravaggio and Churchill have all obliged at odds-on since 2016, O\u2019Brien has also sent out winners at 33-1 and 14-1 in the same period. O\u2019Brien is no better than 4-7 to finish the Royal meeting as the leading trainer while Ryan Moore, his principal jockey, is 8-11 to be the leading rider ahead of Frankie Dettori on 7-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
