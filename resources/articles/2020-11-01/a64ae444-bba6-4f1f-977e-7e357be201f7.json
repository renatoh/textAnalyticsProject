Dr Allan Orr, an expert in counter-insurgency who served as a consultant to the Coalition Counter-Insurgency Academy in Iraq during the war, says the failure to take strong steps in response to the Brereton inquiry would also risk placing Australian soldiers in heightened danger during future operations in Muslim nations, and undermine Australia\u2019s standing at international bodies such as the United Nations. Counter-insurgency campaigns depend heavily on establishing legitimacy and winning over local populations. But Orr says the continued existence of the SAS \u2013 given the public allegations of dozens of unlawful killings of Afghan civilians \u2013 would make that objective extremely difficult. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost the next small war before it starts,\u201d Orr told the Guardian. \u201cCounter-insurgency and counter-terrorism campaigns are a case of politics divided by force. Not disbanding will see Australian forces losing the next small war before the first shot is fired and they will structurally compromise the entire political effort of the next coalition by just being there.\u201d Disbandment, while a radical step, has been used elsewhere. In Canada, the elite Airborne Regiment was disbanded in 1995, following the so-called \u201cSomalia affair\u201d, during which troops were accused of the torture and murder of a Somali teenager. Orr is not the only expert to argue for a similar move in Australia. Christopher Elliott, a researcher with the defence studies department at King\u2019s College London, argued in the Conversation that Australia\u2019s special forces are \u201cnot salvageable, at least in their current structure\u201d. So far, the Australian government has committed to disbanding SAS\u2019s 2 squadron and removing the meritorious unit citation from all special forces who served in Afghanistan. Those moves were enough to prompt anger and resentment among special forces ranks, who felt as though senior command were escaping punishment and contradicting their own public statements that the majority of special forces were beyond reproach. The defence chief, Angus Campbell, said he had considered disbanding the entire regiment after the Brereton report but decided against it. \u201cBut we believe very strongly that the path forward for developing that regiment and Australia\u2019s special operations capability is by committing to building and working with the people to see a better organisation emerge,\u201d he said. Braden Chapman, the signals intelligence officer turned whistleblower who helped expose alleged war crimes, does not think the SAS should be disbanded. \u201c[The SAS] still serve a purpose \u2026 if they move back to how they were, concentrating on their original purpose, it would be much more helpful than that direct action role that they\u2019ve been doing for 18 years,\u201d Chapman told the ABC. But Orr argues disbanding 2 squadron is not only \u201ccompletely disingenuous\u201d but sends the wrong message. \u201cDisbanding a squadron also places blame on the enlisted ranks firmly,\u201d he said. \u201cDisbanding the entire regiment would be the officer corp taking responsibility also, but of course we see now rampantly that wasn\u2019t ever an option.\u201d He said the failure to disband also sends a wider message to the international community. \u201cIt pushes Australia out of the international leadership system with blatant hypocrisy (democracy as we say not as we do),\u201d Orr said. \u201cWe may as well quit the UN because it\u2019s clear you hold your troops to Blackwater levels of accountability and now have the same human-rights power indices as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Russia. \u201cBasically you are tier two now on the global stage. It also sends the message that the army is uncontrollable and unaccountable, determines its own justice.\u201d Orr says the continued existence of the SASR also risks breeding domestic terrorism \u201clike nothing has before\u201d. \u201cThis shows, for those susceptible to radicalisation, proof positive that \u2018white men\u2019 have two sets of rules and that it\u2019s OK to kill non-western peoples,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
