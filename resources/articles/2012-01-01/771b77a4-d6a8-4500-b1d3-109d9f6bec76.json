The 20-year-old, who took up the sport only four years ago and, having won the European Under-23 championships in Ostrava, arrived in Daegu for her debut at the worlds last year, only to fail with all her three jumps at 4.25m in South Korea. The disappointment made her break down in tears after her third and final failed jump but she says the experience has made her a better athlete. \"I think it is good to have had an experience like that [in Daegu]. Firstly I got to experience what a big competition like the world championships was like and that is good with the Olympics coming up. I think what happened there has made me a stronger athlete and more determined in training,\" she said. \"I have remembered what happened there and that has pushed me to work really hard in training, and that has obviously paid off with the height I reached in France at the weekend.\" Her result in Lyon on Sunday has made her a contender for a gold medal at the Olympics \u2013 it was the second-highest jump ever indoors and she also made a decent attempt at Yelena Isinbayeva's world record of 5m \u2013 and she thinks she will thrive on the pressure of being a home medal hope. \"I think it is great that the Olympics are in London. It makes me feel as if I am under pressure and I thrive under pressure. When I was in Lyon there were so many people screaming and shouting and it made me compete so much better,\" she said. \"And if you multiply that by 50, then you get what it is going to be like in London; it will just be an amazing atmosphere and I think it will help me.\" Bleasdale's progress is a remarkable achievement considering that, at the end of 2010, she was ranked 62nd in the world and had a personal best of 4.35m. A year later she was in the top 10 in the world, having jumped 4.71m. Now she has cleared 4.87m and, according to herself, there is more to come. \"I think I have made that kind of progress over the past 12 months because I had so much to work on,\" she said. \"My technique has got a lot better. It is still not perfect but it has got better and I've just started doing strengthening conditioning. We've just increased the workload really.\" In addition Bleasdale and her French coach, Julien Raffalli-Ebezant, have just introduced a nutritionist and a psychologist to prepare her for the Olympics. \"I have only just started covering these aspects and I think I could get a lot stronger mentally. I've got a lot to work on with those aspects and, as I have only just started covering them, they are parts of my training that are only going to improve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
