There was a high probability a man caught on camera was a suspect in a 2002 murder case, the system told him. The city\u2019s surveillance system scans facial features of people on the streets from frames of video footage in real time, creating a virtual map of the face. It can then match this information against scanned faces of suspects in a police database. If there is a match that passes a preset threshold, typically 60% or higher, the system immediately notifies officers. Three days later the police captured the man, who eventually admitted that he was the suspect. Cases such as this, where facial recognition systems are used to help local police crack crime cases, are not unusual in the south-west China city, which recently ranked first in an analysis of the world\u2019s most surveilled cities compiled by the UK-based technology research firm Comparitech. With 2.58m cameras covering 15.35 million people \u2013 equal to one camera for every six residents \u2013 Chongqing has more surveillance cameras than any other city in the world for its population, beating even Beijing, Shanghai and tech hub Shenzhen. Eight of the 10 most surveilled cities in the analysis are in China. London ranked sixth with 627,707 cameras covering 9 million residents and Atlanta, Georgia, came 10th with 7,800 cameras for 501,178 people. Chongqing, China\u2019s most densely populated city, has been part of the Xue Liang (Sharp Eyes) pilot scheme to tackle crime, which ranks the trustworthiness of citizens and penalises or credits them accordingly. Many crimes committed in a certain area of Chongqing were committed by non-residents, so facial recognition cameras were seen as a way to combat this. According to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, China is anticipated to have 626m CCTV cameras in use by next year. But critics warn such widespread surveillance violates internationally guaranteed rights to privacy. To meet international privacy standards enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both collection and use of biometric data should be limited to people found to be involved in wrongdoing, and not broad populations who have no specific link to crime. Individuals should have the right to know what biometric data the government holds on them. China\u2019s automated facial recognition systems violate those standards. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a race to the bottom of privacy among police bureaus in China, with each claiming to be the best and most innovative in carrying out mass surveillance and social control,\u201d says Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese systems are being developed and implemented without meaningful privacy protections against state surveillance. The depth, breadth and intrusiveness of the Chinese government\u2019s mass surveillance on its citizens may be unprecedented in modern history.\u201d Cities elsewhere may not be too far behind China\u2019s mass surveillance. Over the summer, Transport for London used its more than 260 wifi-enabled stations to collect the unique media access control address of users\u2019 smartphone devices, a request sent when a device is searching for a wifi connection, to track their travel journeys precisely. It was only after the media raised awareness of the project that TfL widely informed its passengers. A few weeks later, it emerged that the private operator of the King\u2019s Cross development in London had deployed facial recognition technology in its CCTV network without express consent or warnings to the public. After public outcry and an investigation by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, the programme was scrapped. \u201cWe\u2019ve almost got as many CCTV cameras as China, not quite, but heading that way,\u201d says Paul Wiles, the UK\u2019s biometrics commissioner. \u201cWith the rise of things like facial recognition, that is why we need new legislation that decides what is in the public\u2019s interest and the legal structure within which they can be used. We shouldn\u2019t drift there by accident.\u201d In May, San Francisco became the first major US city to enforce a ban. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who championed the legislation, said: \u201cThis is really about saying: \u2018We can have security without being a security state. We can have good policing without being a police state.\u2019 And part of that is building trust with the community based on good community information, not on Big Brother technology.\u201d Since then, two more Californian cities, Oakland and Berkeley, have also passed bans on all government use of facial recognition technology. Somerville, Massachusetts, passed a similar law this summer. \u201cI think some cities in the UK may well follow those in the US that have banned facial recognition, or at least call for a temporary halt until we can contemplate legislation,\u201d says Wiles. \u201cPersonally, I think the problem with banning is that you then don\u2019t make that crucial decision of whether any of these uses are in the public interest. I would rather see a proper legislative framework and proper trial.\u201d Some people support facial recognition on the basis that technology has always driven change and is a force for good if used responsibly and proportionately. \u201cThe facial recognition technology genie is out of the bottle,\u201d says Stuart Greenfield of Facewatch, the UK\u2019s leading facial recognition company. \u201cIf used responsibly by law enforcement and business to assist in reducing crime it is a positive force for good.\u201d However, others are concerned about the number of surveillance cameras and data collection systems included in \u201csmart city\u201d initiatives. \u201cCity authorities and the people they serve need to be far more sceptical about whether actually having more data is a panacea for various issues, as well as what additional risks it creates,\u201d says Edin Omanovic, advocacy director at Privacy International. \u201cThe obvious risk is that this only really benefits city authorities and the big tech companies who sell the solutions, rather than the actual people they are purporting to help.\u201d Omanovic argues that live facial recognition fundamentally threatens free societies. \u201cIt might start with the monitoring of just a few thousand people but it definitely won\u2019t end there,\u201d says Omanovic. \u201cAuthorities need to permanently ban its roll out now before it\u2019s too late.\u201d There seems to be little sign, though, of cities scaling back surveillance in the near future. \u201cOf all the cities we looked at, the vast majority were increasing their CCTV use or had plans in place to up their surveillance,\u201d says Paul Bischoff, editor of Comparitech. \u201cSingapore has plans to install 100,000 facial-recognition cameras on lampposts, Chicago police have asked for 30,000 more, and Moscow intends to have 174,000 by the end of this year.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
