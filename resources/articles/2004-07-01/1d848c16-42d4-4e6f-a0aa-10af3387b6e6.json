With a seven-under par 135 he leads, by one, a Frenchman, Thomas Levet; by two an Englishman, Barry Lane and a Korean, KJ Choi. Among those on three behind are a Scotsman, Colin Montgomerie, a South African, Ernie Els and a Fijiian, Vijay Singh. Montgomerie might have been only two behind after traversing the 18th hole canyon formed by grandstands holding 7,000 throaty-voiced Scots. He was roared on to that green but, with a depressing touch of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, he three-putted, missing from only three feet. In 2001, at Royal Lytham, which has an 18th hole that is almost a replica of Troon's, he did the same thing, missing a short putt on the 18th green on the second round, and afterwards came out with the extraordinary statement that at that moment he knew he could not win the championship. He will need to think a great deal more positively than that to succeed this week, given the opposition. The leader board is impressive, including as it does the likes of Michael Campbell (four under) and recent major championship winners in Mike Weir and Phil Mickelson (US Masters 2003 and 2004) and Retief Goosen, winner of the his second US Open last month. In 10 years on the US Tour Kendall has played 311 events and has yet to win. He lost a play-off for the Bob Hope Classic earlier this year and despite the lack of titles, makes a lot of money. In winning almost $7m (\u00a33.74m), he has become the highest career money winner on the US Tour without a tournament win, something he could, of course, put spectacularly right this weekend. Lane has resurrected a career that appeared to be in terminal decline after not winning for nine years. He took the British Masters earlier this year but realises the British Open might be another matter. Having said that 95% of golf was played between the ears, he was asked if he was mentally tough enough to win the championship? \"I've no idea,\" he said honestly, \"I'll find out tomorrow or Sunday.\" It might help to forget that this is his 13th Open and his best finish is 13th. So far so good though and a couple of big putts to finish with helped. A 20-footer at the 17th fell in, a 25-footer at the 18th. Paul Casey, having taken a small stride forwards in the first round, took a giant step backwards yesterday, dropping six shots in five holes from the 9th. From five under to one over left him on the same 36-hole total as Lee Westwood, 143. Over the course of the first two days Darren Clarke hit more quality shots than both his partners, some feat considering Adam Scott has won twice on the US Tour this year and Kenny Perry seven times altogether. But the Ulsterman had few of the breaks necessary for a really good score and although after 15 holes he was within a shot of the lead, he clearly felt that he could have set a mark for the others to chase. At the 16th he took an iron for safety off the tee but it almost ran into the brook, saved only by a collective intake of breath from thousands of fans. But it may as well have gone in, given that Clarke bunkered his second, and although he was only a foot from Scott in the same hazard, the Australian had a simple shot; Clarke had no shot at all. It was a classic example of the way things had been going and all he could do was thrash at the ball, sending it trickling into another bunker alongside the one he had just come out of. After recovering from the second sand trap Clarke climbed wearily out and as he stomped the sand from his shoes, treading heavily to his ball, he muttered expletives repeatedly. He bogeyed the hole, and also the short 17th, ending up one under when five or six might have been his due. He was also level with Scott and two behind Perry, who, after hacking it all over the place in the middle of the round, finished with four birdies in the last five holes. Had Clarke let the rub of the green, in favour of his partners and against himself, get to him? \"Unfortunately,\" sighed his manager Chubby Chandler, \"he does. But I hope when he wakes up in the morning and realises he is only three behind the lead he also realises he can still win this championship.\" Perry birdied the 17th after missing the green on the left side. He was presented with the trickiest of chips, up a bank with no green with which to work, and he only just got the ball to the crest of the hill. The American, fearful it might roll back, raced up the bank and marked the ball before it could - and then holed a nasty right-to-left 18-footer for his par. His second to the 18th was hardly startling stuff but, from 25-feet, the birdie putt went in and suddenly he was in contention. Goosen also got away with some loose play. A big hook off the 15th tee landed him a couple of feet away from a pair of spotters, otherwise his ball may never have been found, and his second shot scooted into the rough on the other side of the fairway. From there he hit it to five feet for par. The US Open champion, though, showed real ability with a bunker shot at the last. From the back of the left-hand bunker, down wind, down slope, he conjured the recovery to six inches. So too the escapology of Els. He hit one of the great bunker shots at the 13th in the final round when he won at Muirfield in 2002 and yesterday, one leg in, one out of a Postage Stamp bunker, he managed brilliantly to gain the putting surface. That was good but by holing the resultant 30-footer for a par, to stay two under, he turned it into a golfing version of the Great Escape. He chipped in at the short 14th, got away with a wild hook off the tee at the 15th when it finished on a trampled path and is now is an excellent position to challenge over the weekend. Who is Skip Kendall? The leader Skip Kendall, 39, from Windermere, Florida, is playing in his third Open. He missed the cut in 1987 and was 59th last year. Kendall, who turned pro in 1987, missed a month's golf last year after taking a chunk out of his left index finger while slicing a bagel. He said: \"If I had cut it off completely then I would have been real worried but I just picked it up and they sewed it back on.\" He still finished 70th on the US money list with $1.2m. He missed a first tour win when he lost to Phil Mickelson in a play-off for the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
