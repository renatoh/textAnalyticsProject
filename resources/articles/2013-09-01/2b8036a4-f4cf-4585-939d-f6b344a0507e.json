It's devoted to Motown, but though classics by Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye are included, it's the poetry and vision as much as the grooves of that music that seem to engage Allen. On Tears of a Clown, she threads oblique links to the tune into the ripple and flow of a long piano meditation, and on Stevie Wonder's That Girl and Marvin Gaye's Inner City Blues, tapestries of harmonic shifts shape the stories. Trumpeter Marcus Belgrave joins for three tracks, and he's bright and lissome on Gerald Wilson's swinger Nancy Joe, while altoist David McMurray brings a searing soul-sax edge to Itching in My Heart. There's a tentativeness to some of this music, but Allen's mix of intelligence, spontaneity and precision nonetheless put her in a very special league."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
