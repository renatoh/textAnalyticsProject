Police arrested a 27 year old man, Akayed Ullah, NYPD commissioner James O\u2019Neill said. Ullah was found at the site of the blast with serious burns and the remains of \u201can improvised, low-tech\u201d pipe-bomb style device. Four people suffered injuries, the fire department said. None were life threatening. \u201cThis was an attempted terrorist attack,\u201d said Mayor Bill de Blasio. Asked about claims of connection to the terror group Isis, O\u2019Neill said only that the suspect \u201cdid make statements\u201d. Ullah emigrated from Bangladesh to the United States in 2011 with a F-43 family immigrant visa, the White House said, meaning a family member sponsored his visa. Anonymous officials told the Associated Press that Ullah is speaking with police at the hospital, and that he was inspired by international terror groups. None have claimed credit for the attack. Police swept into several Brooklyn addresses associated with the suspect, though NYPD declined to confirm why they descended on the sites. Ullah had a black cab and limousine license in New York from 2012 to 2015, the city commissioning service said. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the attack was an example of why president Donald Trump wants to end such \u201cchain migration\u201d Subway and bus services resumed nearly full service by late Monday afternoon. De Blasio said there are no specific or credible threats known to New York at this time, and by all indications the suspect acted alone. Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent and the author of The New Threat, about extremist terrorist groups, writes that Bangladesh is often overlooked by terror analysts even though the poor, Muslim-majority country of 160 million has struggled with growing radicalism. Investigators will now be piecing together the 27-year-old\u2019s biography. They will be looking for clues about his potential radicalisation. Much of their focus will be on recent days and weeks, but they will also be digging deep back into his youth in his native land. The most spectacular attack there came in July last year when 22 people \u2013 including 18 foreigners - were killed at a restaurant in an upscale neighbourhood of the capital, Dhaka. Isis claimed responsibility. Smaller attacks have targeted secular bloggers, writers, religious minorities and foreign aid workers. Al-Qaida is active in the country, as are a range of autonomous local groups. As usual, the violence has deep roots: unresolved social, political and cultural tensions between religious conservatives and secular leftists dating back to the 1971 civil war; huge numbers of young men who have limited skills, education and opportunities living in dysfunctional cities and towns; the expansion of conservative Islamic institutions funded by Gulf donors. Connections with a distant native land can be important. Several attackers in the US in recent years with origins in south Asia \u2013 notably Pakistan \u2013 have been trained, funded or otherwise assisted by militant groups based where they or their parents grew up. The Manchester bomber\u2019s close links to Libya were key to his radicalisation and execution of his attack in May this year. But the radicalisation of the two men who attacked the Boston Marathon in 2013 had little to do with the central Asian states where they grew up. Nor did that of Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the Afghan-American recently convicted of carrying out a two-day bombing spree in New York and New Jersey in September 2016. Most research shows the factors that can produce a violent domestic extremist can come together rapidly: a network of like-minded peers, exposure to a particular leader, a contact on the internet, a sudden personal shock or disappointment, a thwarted ambition to travel to a far-flung foreign battlefield. The stories of most recent attackers in the west suggests the primary drivers of their violence are more recent experiences in their new homes, not a legacy of their early lives thousands of miles away. Sanders is asked about immigration again, and reveals a details that was previously attributed to only anonymous officials. The suspect arrived in the US in 2011 with a F-43 family immigrant visa, she says; he had a family member sponsor his visa. \u201cThe president\u2019s policy calls for an end to chain migration,\u201d she says. \u201cIf his policy had been in place then this attacker would not have been allowed to come in the country.\u201d Sanders does not answer a question about whether the president would reconsider the list of countries on his controversial travel ban order, currently under review in the supreme court. Bangladesh, from which the suspect emigrated, is not on that list. White House press secertary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has delivered a statement on this morning\u2019s explosion in New York. \u201cThis morning while New Yorkers were on their way to work,\u201d she says, \u201ca terrorist set off a pipe bomb.\u201d \u201cThankfully there were no life threatening injuries,\u201d she says. She praises police and transit authorities, naming an undercover Port Authority officer, Jack Collins, who she says \u201c apprehended the terrorist along with several other officers.\u201d She then turns the attempted attack to politics. She says it \u201cunderscores the need for Congress to work with the president on immigration reforms that enhance our public safety and border security.\u201d Sanders says that the US needs policies that ensure people \u201care not coming to do harm\u201d to Americans. \u201cWe must move to a merit based system of immigration.\u201d Although police have not publicly described the suspect\u2019s immigration status, anonymous law enforcement officials have said that he immigrated from Bangladesh seven years ago with a legal visa. Sanders then says that the military campaign against the terror group Isis is making \u201cgreat gains\u201d. \u201cWe must also destroy the evil ideology behind Isis and attacks like today.\u201d Asked about potential legislation, Sanders blames Democrats in Congress, saying they \u201chave failed to take action\u201d and that the president wants to end \u201cchain migration\u201d, alluding to a policy that allows family members to sponsor relatives for visas. Law enforcement sources have also told the AP that the suspect, Akayed Ullah, arrived from Bangladesh with a visa seven years ago, and that he was living in Brooklyn. The officials said that he was inspired by the terror group Isis but had no contact with its members, and that he is speaking with investigators at the hospital. Adam Gabbatt is at one of the Brooklyn addresses associated with Ullah. At 12.30pm a bomb squad vehicle was parked outside an apartment building in Kensington, a quiet residential neighborhood. An officer wearing a bomb squad vest and a helmet, carrying a set of bolt cutters, entered the building along with a man wearing a FBI jacket and other police officers. Witnesses said a swat team had earlier entered the six story building, which is at the side of the busy Ocean Parkway, which runs north-south through this section of Brooklyn. Police were also reportedly present at a property about half a mile away, which is also said to be linked to Ullah. NYPD would not confirm that their presence was linked to Ullah, nor comment at all on the investigation. Reuters reports that the suspect, who has two associated addresses in Brooklyn, according to public records, worked at least for some time as a driver in New York City. New York\u2019s taxi and limousine commission told the news wire that the suspect, who had a Brooklyn address, had a black cab and limousine driver\u2019s license from 2012 to 2015, after which it expired. Local news stations for CBS and NBC have reported that he immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh seven years ago, details that anonymous law enforcement officials have also told the Washington Post. We are working to confirm these details. The Associated Press reports, citing anonymous law enforcement officials, that the suspect was \u201cinspired\u201d by the terror group Isis. NYPD commissioner James O\u2019Neill refused to go into statements made by the suspect or details of his background. Law enforcement officials tell the Associated Press that Akayed Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State Group, but apparently had no direct contact with the terrorist group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the suspect or incident. The suspect had burns on his abdomen and also to his hands. Three others suffered minor injuries, including headaches and ringing in the ears. Reports of New Yorkers frightened or panicked by the explosion are greatly exaggerated, Jamiles Lartey relays. \u201cIt\u2019s the subway, you know,\u201d commuter Shaun Henderson said. \u201cNew Yorkers are used to this. The F train doesn\u2019t need a pipe bomb to be fucked up.\u201d New York has quickly returned to its normal rhythm of work and tourism \u2013 not to mention annoyance at the normal subway delays \u2013 but as investigators look into the background of the suspect, Bill de Blasio\u2019s office has been keen to reassure residents and visitors to the city. Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr issued a statement in line with those of the mayor and governor this morning, urging calm and resilience. The people of New York City remain united against terror. While today\u2019s attack on our subway system reinforces our need to be vigilant, it will not break our resolve to live our lives as we see fit. No cowardly attack can change the core of who we are as New Yorkers. I especially want to thank our first responders, including the New York City Police and Fire Departments, Port Authority Police Department and the MTA Police Department, for everything they do on a daily basis to keep our city safe and secure,\u201d said Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. Jamiles Lartey and Paul Owen are reporting from midtown Manhattan, where dozens of police cars, armored trucks and fire department vehicles have swarmed and officers have blocked off stretches of 8th Avenue. Rolling a large suitcase, Tina Grimes, 38, was supposed to be getting on a bus to Boston. \u201cI came early to catch a bus around 8 and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Whoa what\u2019s going on?\u2019 There were cops everywhere and the place was sealed off. it was scary.\u201d Grimes said she doesn\u2019t know what to do now. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too cold to walk around. Maybe I\u2019ll go shopping or something. Make the best of this extra day in New York.\u201d Danny Nguyen, 24, saw the smoke and heard the explosion. Nguyen was waiting for a bus back to Philadelphia from the Port Authority, and described the police response. \u201cThe police ran down and told us to grab our bags close to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw a mom trying to take her daughter up the elevator the wrong way, just panicking.\u201d After seeing the smoke, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s when everything connected and I realized this was serious.\u201d Barbara Petro had been due to return to Columbia, Maryland, on a 9.25am bus. \u201cI came to spend the weekend here, to see the art museums and Christmas scenes in the city.\u201d Would this incident put her off doing that again? \u201cNo. It can happen in DC, it can happen in Chicago. I\u2019m in a lot of big cities for work. I don\u2019t want people to think that these things will put us off from the city.\u201c The Port Authority, the midtown bus hub used by millions of commuters, has already reopened. At about 7.20am, an improvised device exploded in the subway passageway between transport hubs under Times Square and the Port Authority, in midtown Manhattan. Police arrested an injured 27 year old man, Akayed Ullah, NYPD commissioner James O\u2019Neill said. Ullah was found at the site of the blast with burns and the remains of \u201can improvised, low-tech\u201d pipe-bomb style device, he said. Four people suffered injuries, the fire department said. None were life threatening. \u201cThis was an attempted terrorist attack,\u201d said Mayor Bill de Blasio. Asked about claims of connection to the terror group Isis, O\u2019Neill said that the suspect \u201cdid make statements but we\u2019re not going to talk about that right now\u201d. O\u2019Neill would not say whether the suspect detonated the device deliberately or it went off accidentally. Transit authorities promised that subway and bus service, with the exception of the crime scene itself, would resume full service by rush hour Monday evening. Police declined to discuss the background of the suspect, and said nothing about what he might have said to police. De Blasio said there are no specific or credible threats known to New York at this time, and by all indications the suspect acted alone. Miller is asked about threats to New York, and says that authorities have foiled many plots already. But he warns, \u201cthis is a fact of life whether your\u2019e in New York or London or Paris: the question is \u2018can it happen here?\u2019 and the answer is it can happen anywhere. A reporter asks whether the suspect make any claims about the terror group Isis? O\u2019Neill: \u201cHe did make statements but we\u2019re not going to talk about that right now.\u201d Just before concluding the press conference with a promise of a future update, the police commissioner says, \u201cWe\u2019re investigating his background right now to see what addresses he had.\u201d NPYD commissioner O\u2019Neill declines to answer a question whether the suspect said anything before attempting to detonate the device. He\u2019s asked about vulnerabilities in the subway system. \u201cWe have almost 3,000 transit cops,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cAll parts of the system are patrolled.\u201d A question follows about the explosive device. An official named John Miller says that \u201cwithout getting into too many specifics\u201d the device was a type of pipe bomb, made in part with a combination of velcro and zip ties\u201d. A reporter asks whether the suspect detonated the device himself. O\u2019Neill says police are looking into it. He refuses to say anything about the suspect\u2019s background. Daniel Nigro, the fire department commissioner, says that Ullah sustained burns to his hands and torso, but that the three other people only suffered minor injuries Joe Lhota, the transport chief, says that nearly all subway service is being resumed, and should be back to normal by rush hour tonight. A few parts of the subway, namely the site of the explosion, will remain closed off to service. Mayor Bill de Blasio says there are no credible or known of threats at this time, and that as far as NYPD know the sole suspect, under arrest, acted alone. He calls the explosion a terror attack, and says that there will be expanded NYPD presence around the city today. \u201cWhen you see something say something, this is the difference maker, we\u2019ve seen it time and time again.\u201d He encourages New Yorkers who feel uncomfortable about a package to tell police: \u201cIt\u2019s so important to speak up because you could be saving many lives by doing so.\u201d O\u2019Neill then gives \u201cpreliminary facts\u201d about the explosion. In the subway passage between the Times Sq shuttle and the 1-2-3 trains, he says, polcie were called after report of teh explosion. They \u201cfound an injured 27 year old man\u201d with burns on his body. O\u2019Neill names him as Akayed Ullah, and says he \u201chad an improvised low tech explosive device attached to his body\u201d. \u201cThree other people in the immediate area also sustained minor injuries.\u201d He says police are now looking into Ullah\u2019s background. Commissioner James O\u2019Neill begins. \u201cAt approximate 7.20 this morning we had a terror related incident in the passageway at 42nd and 7th,\u201d he says. Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks next, saying \u201cthe first news this morning was obviously very frightening and disturbing, [an attack on the subway] which is in many ways one of our worst nightmares.\u201d The reality turned out better than the initial expectation and fear. You have a number of law enforcement agencies that did fantastic job.\u201d Cuomo says there was an explosion of \u201can effectively low tech device. There were several injuries we hope minor. And it was handled extraordinarily well\u201d. \u201cThere was a disruption in train service and bus service while a sweep was being done, that\u2019s all being restored now. Subway service except at 42nd street is being restored.\u201d He then speaks to the fact of New York\u2019s stature as a targeted city. \u201cThis is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. We have the statue of Liberty in our harbor. Anyone can go on the internet and download garbage and vileness, how to put together an amateur level explosive device, and that is the reality we live with. \u201cThe counter reality is that this is New York and we all pitch together, and we are a savvy people and we keep our eyes open and tha\u2019ts what see something say something is about. And we have the best law enforcement in the globe. \u201cAll the service will resume. Let\u2019s go back to work. we\u2019re not going to let them disrupt us.\u201d An explosion beneath the area of the Port Authority and Time Square, New York, has led to the detention of one suspect and a mass evacuation of the subway system in midtown Manhattan. Police and city officials, including NYPD commissioner James O\u2019Neill, are due to give a press conference any minute. The Fire Department said that four people were reported injured. There are numerous conflicting reports about the suspect, including that an explosive device was worn. The blast appears to have been captured on surveillance video in the subway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
