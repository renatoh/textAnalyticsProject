It has issued a press release that says it is taking over DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in cash -- partly to stop Microsoft from buying it. DoubleClick is one of the most commonly blocked services not just for serving banner ads but because of its tracking cookies. DoubleClick has raised objections from those concerned about privacy. In 1999, it bought a company called Abacus Direct to get access to consumer data from its catalogue sales. This led the US Federal Trade Commission to investigate its privacy practices. DoubleClick agreed to restrictions and settled out of court for $450,000; it also paid $1.8 million in fees to settle a related class action lawsuit. Now DoubleClick will no doubt be able to help Google to exploit its unparalleled ability to track users via the AdWords that appear on huge numbers of web pages, as well as alongside their private email etc. The \"Don't be evil\" company also produced some gushing marketroidspeak on its Official Blog. It begins: At Google, we are constantly looking for new, innovative ways to make the information you want more accessible and more relevant--and to deliver it as fast as possible. Since Google's inception, it has always been our intention to present users with highly targeted, useful advertisements when appropriate--ads that unobtrusively complement users experience. We have always believed in, and tirelessly pursued, the idea that serving relevant, unintrusive ads would best serve our advertisers in the long term. To that end, we are truly excited to announce our acquisition of DoubleClick. DoubleClick provides a suite of products that enables agencies, advertisers, and publishers to work efficiently, that will enable Google to extend our ad network and develop deeper relationships with our partners. Whether all these partners will appreciate Google knowing their entire ad business forwards, backwards and upside down while they are trying to compete with Google to sell ads remains to be seen. According to the Reuters story on the deal: \"This shores up Google as the absolute leader in the online space,\" said Forrester Research senior analyst Shar VanBoskirk. \"This rounds out their capabilities in everything in the online space. There isn't anything they don't have.\" New York-based DoubleClick would also fortify Google with ad-targeting and analysis capabilities as the company expands into print, radio, video, mobile and television ad markets. \"The DoubleClick platform touches so many of the existing Google customers,\" Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said on a conference call. \"It accelerates our entry into some of these markets by several years.\" One curiosity is that this is an all-cash deal. Sure, Google is rolling in billions and doesn't have to care about small change. However, deals like this are usually done for shares, and Google shares used to be extremely desirable. You can now assume that they are not. Update: \"Google's planned $3.1bn acquisition of DoubleClick ran into a storm of complaints on Sunday. Some of the companies biggest rivals claims the deal would create an advertising behemoth with the power to dictate terms to online publishers and service providers,\" reports The Financial Times. Complaints emerged from Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Yahoo and AOL. The story adds: Google's gambit also showed signs of drawing complaints over its potential impact on online privacy. In one side-effect of the deal, Google said it would for the first start to \"tag\" its users, or add identifying cookies to their machines, an approach that would \"increase the relevance of ads online.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
