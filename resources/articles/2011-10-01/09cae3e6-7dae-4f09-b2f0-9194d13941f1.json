At the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers' (Solace) summit in Edinburgh this week, delegates decided it was time for some linguistic honesty. Doing things a bit better is not transforming them. Ministers have repeatedly argued that back office savings and sharing services with other councils is the way to cope with a 30% cut in council budgets by 2014-15. In a communiqu\u00e9 on the discussions published at the end of the summit, Solace highlighted the danger of trying to respond to plunging budgets and rising demand for services by simply trying to become ever more efficient. \"We sweat hard to do things faster, better and cheaper,\" it said. \"In the short term that improves services and cuts costs but in the face of rapid social change, growing and more complex demand and a long-term cut in funding it is a strategy doomed to fail. We might end up doing the wrong things very efficiently.\" The answer is to look outside your organisation for new issues and ideas. The best managers, delegates agreed, spend just as much time talking to residents, partner organisations and businesses as they do to councillors and staff. This is the only way that councils can hope to understand and respond to social change and global trends. Town hall politics must not obscure the big issues: \"Our role is to improve our communities' quality of life, not to crowbar community needs into the council's culture and structure.\" Exploiting the opportunities provided by technology is central to this. Councils are only just beginning to understand the relevance and potential of social networking. The chief executives felt that it had many of the same values as local government \u2013 engendering a sense of community, empowering the individual, listening and sharing, being open, and responding quickly to need. Conference delegates felt that local government needed to see the networked world as central to its future. It only takes moments to see the potential \u2013 think how housebound elderly people could use social networking for everything from managing their own care to making new friends, for example. Councils don't need to control it; they just need to act as the catalyst and provide support such as finding volunteers to teach computer skills. You quickly enter a world where local people are inventing and developing their own services, shaping them precisely to their needs, with managers using the latent skills of local people to do most of the work. The result is services that staff may never have imagined. Going down that route means two other widely misused terms that managers love \u2013 co-production and personalisation \u2013 become a reality. That really is transformational.
