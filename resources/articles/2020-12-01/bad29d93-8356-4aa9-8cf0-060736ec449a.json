At the heart of both antitrust actions, announced on Wednesday, is Facebook\u2019s dominance of the social media landscape, and whether the company gobbled up potential competitors and blocked market access to others that could have eaten into its staggering market share. One lawsuit brings together nearly every state in the US, a coalition led by New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James. The suit accuses Facebook of abusing its market power to quash smaller competitors. \u201cFor nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,\u201d said James in a statement. \u201cToday, we are taking action to stand up for the millions of consumers and many small businesses that have been harmed by Facebook\u2019s illegal behavior. Instead of competing on the merits, Facebook used its power to suppress competition so it could take advantage of users and make billions by converting personal data into a cash cow.\u201d The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which collaborated with the attorneys general in a years-long investigation, launched its own suit alleging that Facebook engaged in a \u201csystematic strategy\u201d of anticompetitive conduct. The FTC is seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that could force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp. \u201cFacebook\u2019s actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition,\u201d Ian Conner, director of the FTC\u2019s bureau of competition, said in a statement. \u201cOur aim is to roll back Facebook\u2019s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.\u201d Facebook generated revenues of more than $70bn and profits above $18.5bn in just the last year, according to the FTC\u2019s complaint, and regulators allege that anticompetitive actions taken by the company\u2019s executives, including Mark Zuckberg, gave them a monopoly in the market. Investigators spent months looking into Facebook\u2019s acquisition of two big apps in particular: a $1bn deal to buy the photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012, and the $19bn purchase of the global messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. Together, the buys brought the top four social media companies worldwide under Facebook\u2019s control. The FTC cleared Facebook for the acquisitions when they occurred, and the company is hoping to leverage those approvals in mounting a defense. Facebook executives are also arguing that their company has helped the apps grow. \u201cThis is revisionist history,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s vice-president and general counsel, Jennifer Newstead, in a statement provided to the Guardian. \u201cThe government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final. People and small businesses don\u2019t choose to use Facebook\u2019s free services and advertising because they have to, they use them because our apps and services deliver the most value. We are going to vigorously defend people\u2019s ability to continue making that choice.\u201d But Facebook has come under greater scrutiny since the deals were done, and the FTC launched a new investigation into the potential antitrust violations in 2019. In one 2012 email, made public through a separate investigation by the US House judiciary subcommittee, Zuckerberg highlighted how Instagram had an edge on mobile, an area where Facebook was falling behind. In another, the CEO said Instagram could hurt Facebook even if it did not become huge. \u201cThe businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. Instagram\u2019s co-founder also fretted that his company might be targeted for destruction by Zuckerberg if he refused the deal. At the time of its acquisition, Instagram had 30 million users, and, even though it was growing rapidly, it wasn\u2019t yet making money. WhatsApp boasted more than 450 million monthly active users when it was acquired. \u201cWhatsApp is on a path to connect 1 billion people,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a statement at the time. Along with the acquisitions, the suits allege that for years Facebook created unfair conditions for third-party software developers that sought access to its platform, when those developers had the potential to develop tools that could compete with Facebook\u2019s offerings. If successful, the suits would require Facebook to open its platform to software developers, as well as divest from apps that have given it such vast market control. The company would also need approval for any future mergers or acquisitions. In May, Facebook took over Giphy, a hugely popular moving-image app, with plans to integrate it with Instagram. Late last month, the company also announced plans to acquire Kustomer, an e-commerce app. The FTC voted 3-2 to proceed with the injunction, which was filed in US district court for the District of Columbia. Facebook is not the only big tech player to face antitrust action. In October, the US Department of Justice brought charges against Google, alleging monopolistic behavior. The efforts represent a turning of the tide as Washington and public opinion sours on big tech, which has so far enjoyed exponential growth and an almost unobstructed rise to power.
