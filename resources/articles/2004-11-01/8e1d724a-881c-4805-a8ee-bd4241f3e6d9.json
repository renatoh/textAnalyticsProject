The 23-year-old, with 10 goals in 18 games this season, was forced off barely 15 minutes into the Czech Republic's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Macedonia on Wednesday. Baros, who has been dogged with minor hamstring problems this season, is expected to return for Liverpool's games over the festive period. Ruud van Nistelrooy hopes to be fit to lead Manchester United's attack against Charlton tomorrow despite the hip injury which forced his first-half substitution in Holland's 3-0 World Cup win over Andorra on Wednesday. Holland's manager Marco van Basten said the striker had been in a lot of pain but Van Nistelrooy played down the injury, saying: \"It is just a knock. It is nothing serious.\" Van Nistelrooy had only just returned to league duty in last Sunday's 3-1 win at Newcastle after a three-match ban for a late challenge on Arsenal's Ashley Cole last month. Chelsea's newly acquired status among the major players in European football is to be recognised by an invitation to join G-14. The grouping of elite clubs currently has 18 members including Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. It plans a further expansion to strengthen its hand in the fight over issues such as the demand that national associations recompense clubs for the use of their players at major tournaments. Representatives of Chelsea, Newcastle and the Scottish Old Firm of Rangers and Celtic are among clubs being invited to send observers to the next meeting in January with a view to formal acceptance into membership in March. The Scottish Football Association belatedly began interviewing candidates to succeed Berti Vogts as national coach yesterday after angry fans also demanded the departure of its chief executive, David Taylor, during Wednesday's 4-1 home defeat by Sweden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
