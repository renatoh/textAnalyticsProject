The bar, which closes for the final time at 11pm on Monday night, is actually several months shy of its 20th birthday and owner Alan Miller says he has been forced out of business by red tape. In January the nearby Joiners Arms will also close, when its lease runs out and property developers move in. Venue promoters around the country claim overzealous restrictions from councils stipulating the number of security staff they must employ and limiting the hours for outdoor drinking are killing the \u00a366bn night-time economy. Miller\u2019s decision to quit Brick Lane followed a standoff with the police over these issues, at a cost to the business of about \u00a32,000 per shift. A curfew in his courtyard, he says, meant he lost 50% of his customers in two years. \u201cWe went through a whole summer waiting for the police to agree to a reduction in security, then they complained we weren\u2019t handing over enough people with drugs, and you\u2019re like: \u2018How many people is that?\u2019 The idea that you have to restrict all these businesses is ridiculous and insulting to the public. It is crushing an industry that is one of the most dynamic we have.\u201d He acknowledges concern about binge-drinking but believes clubs and bars are held disproportionately responsible and points to a wider backdrop of falling crime. Alex Proud, owner of galleries and restaurants in London and Brighton, and the Proud Camden nightclub, said: \u201cThe environment is becoming almost inoperable. I went from running a very healthy business to almost going under two years ago. The costs of licensing and security are probably around \u00a3100,000 a year. We had two reviews and won both but they\u2019ll cost another \u00a3100,000 with barristers and so on. \u201cI\u2019ll be getting out of the game soon, I can\u2019t see myself running a nightclub for more than another few years.\u201d The live music promoter Harvey Goldsmith said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always had to contend with these problems but the pressure has got a lot stronger over the past three years. \u201cIt all started when the last government started 24-hour drinking and didn\u2019t figure out the knock-on effects. Then some areas just went over the top. The authorities have got to accept that the heart and soul of a city is its night-time economy, otherwise you\u2019ll end up like Bonn or Canberra where at five o\u2019clock the city shuts down.\u201d The pressure on night-time venues has prompted those remaining to set up the Music Venue Trust, which is campaigning for laws to protect them in disputes with neighbours. Mark Davyd, a founder of the trust, said it was also necessary to break the link made by some authorities between music, crime and disorder. \u201cThese are cultural spaces, arts spaces \u2013 these are the colleges and universities where we grow our UK music talent,\u201d he added. Sacha Lord, who runs Manchester\u2019s biggest nightclub, the Warehouse Project, believes his city is one place where the authorities have got things right. He recently began a trial of breathalysers on the door of the club, but scanners are not a condition of his licence. This was not reviewed after the death from drugs of clubber Nick Bonnie last year, he says, because police knew about his tough approach. \u201cManchester has the biggest student population in Europe. Students are supposed to come here to get educated but they come here to party and the council gets that \u2013 they are very forward-thinking,\u201d Lord says. \u201cI\u2019ve operated in Leeds and I know that if you have a venue with a capacity of 300-400 and you\u2019re insisting on ID scanning, on X amount of security, as a business owner it\u2019s just not viable.\u201d A spokesman from Tower Hamlets said the council strongly supported Brick Lane, and that planning and licensing regulations have not changed: \u201cBar owners and restaurateurs operate within the legal opening hours that they have planning permission for. If a bar wants to extend their opening hours they can apply to do so.\u201d The Metropolitan police declined to say whether their approach had changed in the past two years. The Met said in a statement that London\u2019s night-time economy \u201cis policed appropriately according to intelligence and demand\u201d and highlighted the two crime prevention objectives in the 2003 Licensing Act."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
