The two-times world champion was certainly delighted by a very comfortable-looking pair of slippers his father, Shah, had given him. For the record, they looked lovely. Yet there was no cake. No party. No birthday bash with his friends. Three years ago Khan was sucked into all that and the result was a defeat, albeit a controversial one, by Lamont Peterson which meant his WBF and IBF titles were ripped from his grasp. Now though, as the boy from Bolton sat in a plush Las Vegas hotel dissecting his preparation and mental state before a critical fight with the American Devon Alexander here on Saturday, it was clear there has been a lot of growing up since those naive, perhaps more carefree days. With the trainer Virgil Hunter now calling the shots, a fight against Floyd Mayweather lurching into view and a young family to support, Khan says he has changed. A career-defining, and bank balance-boosting, showdown with Mayweather is the dream. Khan makes no bones about wanting his cake. He will eat it \u2013 just not now. Alexander, who should not be underestimated, needs to be dealt with first. \u201cI really like the slippers but I\u2019d rather not have presents because you may lose focus,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be happy and enjoying things. I can save all that till after the fight. \u201cI am a fighter; I am going to war. My life is on the line so I can\u2019t enjoy myself eating cake. I have a big fight ahead of me. Once you\u2019re in camp Virgil says the whole focus has to be about the fight. \u201cBefore that Peterson fight I had all my mates around, we were eating cake and talking about what was going on in Bolton. I lost my focus. That wouldn\u2019t happen now. I perform better when I am bored. \u201cI feel much better now than when I was 26. I feel stronger, healthier and fitter than I did at 26. I\u2019m in better shape, I\u2019m a better weight. I\u2019ve changed a lot in my life because it\u2019s not easy to get as fit or strong at my age. \u201cI can see myself getting better as a fighter. I am becoming more strict, professional and more disciplined at this age. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think I am getting to my peak. I thought I might have hit my peak at 24, 25 but I\u2019m getting to my peak now. Physically I have changed a lot. Being married with a settled life helps me tremendously.\u201d Khan arrived from his San Francisco training base late on Monday evening and as his entourage made their way towards the forever glowing Las Vegas strip he would have seen the huge billboards promoting his first fight at the MGM Grand, a place where boxing dreams are made and shattered in equal measure. On the undisputed glitziest stage of all Khan will be wearing the most expensive shorts ever. Apparently they will have a 24-carat gold thread on the waistband and are made of white nappa leather. Fashonistas may wince yet this is Khan\u2019s attempt at showing the boxing world he needs to be taken very seriously. He knows coming to America and succeeding catapults careers like nothing else. Providing for his wife and baby daughter has become as important as anything else, though. Khan is smart enough to know he will not be in the fight game forever. \u201cBeing a father has changed me a lot. Everything I do in sport now is to give my family a comfortable life, I want my daughter Lamaisah to grow up and say: \u2018My dad was a great champion.\u2019 That\u2019s the biggest motivation to have when your little girl goes to school and her friends say: \u2018Your dad was a great fighter.\u2019 \u201cI want to win this fight and I want to go on to bigger fights in the future. I\u2019m doing it for my family. I\u2019m a family man now. I am putting my body on the line. I am going to war. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about me, or feeding Amir. It\u2019s about my whole family, looking after them. It\u2019s only given me strength in training camp. Knowing I have a little girl helps me get through tough times and tough training camps. \u201cThis has been the hardest training camp I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve done around 160 rounds of sparring; we\u2019ve just been very focused. Being away from her is hard \u2013 being away from my little girl \u2013 but it\u2019s just one of those things. I last saw her seven weeks ago when they came to training camp. \u201cI\u2019m not putting on any nappies though! I put the boxing gloves on and say: \u2018I can\u2019t change nappies!\u2019 \u201cHaving a family is a motivation. It is driving me and pushing me to try harder. Everything I\u2019m doing is for them. When you are on your own, that hunger may not be there. \u201cI\u2019m not really a big spender or one of those guys who splashes money on things, like Mayweather. He needs to earn big to go with his lifestyle. I don\u2019t need to make billions in my career. I just want to make sure I have enough and I\u2019ve made enough for her education.\u201d Smart words indeed. Khan appears to be learning at just the right time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
