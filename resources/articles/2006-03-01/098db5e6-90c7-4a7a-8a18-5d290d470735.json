Macquarie has become the second foreign company in six months to be handed a radio licence by media regulator Ofcom - the first was Canadian media giant CanWest, which won a licence to launch a new station in the Solent. Plymouth's new station will be Diamond FM, a rock station for 18- to 54-years-olds, that will feature local news and infomation mixed with mainstream classic rock music during the day, and alternative rock music during the evenings. On hearing that the bid he fronted has beaten off competition from four other groups, Mr Schoonmaker said: \"We are looking forward to bringing a quicken-your-pulse radio station to the people of Plymouth.\" Mr Schoonmaker, who resigned from Kiss and Magic parent Emap at the beginning of 2004, has fronted Macquarie's attempt to break in to the UK market with bids from licences in Ipswich, Warwick, Swansea and the north-east of England. The new Plymouth radio station will cover adult population of around 200,000 and its licence will run for 12 years. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
