But some of the biggest British music acts of the 1970s are reaping prodigious financial rewards on the other side of the Atlantic after deciding to shelve their differences and hit the road. The Police, who drifted from punk to rock/reggae fusion after forming in 1977, head the list of big earners, having made $131.9m (\u00a366m) from their US tour this year. Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland, who broke up acrimoniously in the mid-1980s, reformed for a 30th anniversary world tour - and it paid off. They sold 1.15 million tickets at an average $114 in the US. An even more seasoned veteran of the British music scene, Rod Stewart, who started out in the 1960s with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces before going solo in 1969, took $49m, according to a list of the 20 highest-earning concert acts in North America compiled by the music industry's Pollstar magazine. Genesis, the prog-rock band fronted first by Peter Gabriel and then Phil Collins, also did well by reuniting. The group, which Collins left in 1996, made $47.6m from 25 US shows. Bringing up the rear of the latest British invasion of the US was Roger Waters, who played in Pink Floyd from 1965 until 1985, when he fell out with David Gilmour. He took $38.3m. Although Pink Floyd re-formed to play Live 8 in July 2005, a reunion tour - no matter how lucrative - seems unlikely as the band are reported to have turned down \u00a3125m to play together again around the world. The top 20 features a number of immensely popular US artists who are less well known over here. The country singer Kenny Chesney pipped Justin Timberlake to second place by making $71.1m from 54 shows. Timberlake pocketed $70.6m from 60 concerts. The husband and wife country music team of Tim McGraw and Faith Hill came in at No 6, having made $52.3m from 44 bookings. Celine Dion, who is coming to the end of a five-year run in Las Vegas, made $65.3m from 113 concerts at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, this year. Barry Manilow may not have made the top 10 - he earned a mere $34.8m -but he can still boast of charging the most for tickets. A seat to hear him at the Las Vegas Hilton set his fans back $142. The hottest reunion ticket of the year belonged to another British group. More than a million people applied for 18,000 online tickets when Led Zeppelin announced their first gig in 19 years, on December 10 in London.
