But Belgium achieved a new distinction this week when its highest court banned a far-right political party for espousing racist views. The roots of the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Blok lie in wartime collaboration with the Nazis, though in recent years it has reinvented itself to appear more respectable while focusing on the dangers of non-European immigration. It controls a third of the council in Antwerp, Belgium's second city, but has been kept out of power by a so-called \"cordon sanitaire\" - the refusal of other parties to form coalitions with it. The Blok's popularity, however, is growing: its share of the vote has gone from under 10% in 1999 to 24% last summer. It is now the most popular party in Flanders, home to 60% of Belgians. The latest decision upheld a ruling by a lower court that associations set up to finance and train Blok officials had broken anti-racism laws. The result is that it will lose all state funding and faces a media ban. But this is far from a disaster for the party, which now simply intends to rename itself and make some cosmetic changes to its rules. The Vlaams Belang (The Flemish Interest) looks like being virtually indistinguishable from its illegal predecessor. This is an issue with echoes right across Europe. Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Denmark are all struggling to respond to the linked issues of anti-immigrant feeling and the rise of rightwing, neo-fascist and populist parties. Next door in the Netherlands there is turmoil where a Muslim is suspected of murdering a controversial film producer. The danger in Belgium is that a ban will reinforce the Vlaams Blok's status as anti-establishment outsider and attract more protest voters. But the shift to the mainstream could also enhance its respectability and widen its support. Surely the better method, used in Britain since the 1930s, is to refrain from banning extremist parties, unless they threaten the state, while ensuring that individuals do not breach laws designed to protect religious and racial minorities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
