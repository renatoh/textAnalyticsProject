That week three years ago, temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona were forecasted to top 115F (46C). Moore, his wife and two children went to the mountains for a camping trip, and his dad Gene, stayed behind. A few days later, Gene died. The air conditioning had been blowing hot air. \u201cHe\u2019d opened a window but it was too hot,\u201d Moore said. \u201cMy dad\u2019s heart basically gave out on him.\u201d Phoenix \u2013 America\u2019s hottest city \u2013 is getting hotter and hotter, and Moore\u2019s father is one of the hundreds of Arizonans who have succumbed to the desert heat in recent years. In August this year, Maricopa county, which encompasses Phoenix, recorded 1,000 Covid-19 deaths. That same month, the county was investigating more than 260 heat-related deaths. This summer, temperatures here stayed above 90F (32C), even at night, for 28 days straight, with the scorching weather in July and August breaking records. It was so hot and dry that towering saguaro cactuses that dot the landscape began to topple over and die. At the same time, wildfires across the western US this year cast a foreboding orange glow over the region and clouded Phoenix communities, already breathing some of the highest concentrations of toxic pollution in the nation, with even more smoke. \u201cI grew up in the desert, in the heat,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I think about what it\u2019s going to be like in another five years, in 10 years.\u201d The thought has been weighing on him \u2013 and many other Arizonans \u2013 as they cast their ballots ahead of next week\u2019s elections. Even amid a global pandemic, and the economic catastrophe it has triggered, polls find that Americans increasingly cite the climate emergency as a major concern. That\u2019s especially true in regions like Maricopa, where the crisis is already having deadly effects. Once a stronghold of western conservatism, Maricopa county has been slowly undergoing a political transformation \u2013 and has become one of the fiercely contested election battlegrounds in the nation. Asked to choose between a Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, who recognizes global heating as an emergency, and a Republican, Donald Trump, who has called it a \u201choax\u201d, a growing number of voters in the Valley of the Sun say they are seeking leadership that will address climate and help their desert home survive an increasingly precarious future. \u2018The crossroads of the climate crisis\u2019 \u201cWe are a desert community,\u201d said Laura Jimena Dent, the executive director of the Arizona-based environmental justice non-profit Chispa. \u201cWe are literally at the crossroads of the climate crisis.\u201d Since 1865, the temperatures in Maricopa have risen by nearly 2C. And since the 1950s, the water level in the region\u2019s well has dropped by 125ft. Even in a politically divided swing state, that\u2019s hard for anyone to ignore. A recent survey found that nearly three-quarters of Arizonans \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that the federal government \u201cneeds to do more to combat climate change\u201d. Even after the coronavirus pandemic hit this year, when researchers at Yale university conducted an annual survey of voters across the country, climate change went up on a list of voter priorities. \u201cYou see that reflected in how much political leaders \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 have been talking about climate change this election,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, an expert on public opinion of climate change at Yale University. Whereas liberal Democrats ranked climate change as their second most important issue out of 30, moderate Democrats rank it 8th, and moderate Republicans rank it somewhere in the middle. But in the US, and in Maricopa county, most voters agree climate change is happening, and they want lawmakers to do something about it. \u201cFor the first time in American history, climate change has reached the very top echelons of voting issues,\u201d Leiserowitz said. Indeed, just a few weeks ago, Americans heard Trump and Biden respond to the first question about the climate crisis at a presidential debate in 20 years. While Trump flatly refused to acknowledge that climate change was fueling wildfires across the west, Biden touted a $2tn plan to invest in green infrastructure, emphasizing the \u201cmillions of good-paying jobs\u201d that his climate proposals could create. Responding to the wildfires ripping across California in a speech earlier this summer, Biden also cast the climate crisis as a threat to the safety and security of America\u2019s suburbs, flipping an attack the president has leveled against him to appeal to voters in regions like Maricopa \u2013 a sprawling suburban oasis in the desert. \u201cIf you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?\u201d he asked. Similarly, in a heated debate between the state\u2019s US Senate candidates, the incumbent Republican Martha McSally, who serves on the Senate energy and natural resources committee and is a close ally of the president, acknowledged \u201cthe climate is changing\u201d, but derided any \u201cheavy-handed approach\u201d to addressing it. Meanwhile, the Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, mused about how fragile the planet looks from low-Earth orbit. \u201cThere is no planet B,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do a better job taking care of this planet.\u201d The stark contrast between the parties\u2019 stances can help explain why voters in Maricopa have been increasingly repelled by the Republicans, said Josh Ulibarri, a Democratic pollster based in Phoenix. Conservatives here have been slowly leaving a Republican party that has grown increasingly extreme and rightwing. \u201cClimate is part of that,\u201d Ulibarri said. Fifteen years ago, Arizona was one of the first states to develop a climate action plan, and climate change \u2013 at least in this region \u2013 was a bipartisan issue. John McCain, the state\u2019s late senior senator, was one of the few Republican lawmakers in Washington DC to support climate change legislation. But as national and local politics became more polarized, Republican politicians moved right. As a result, \u201ccollege-educated voters and women voters have moved away from Republicans because they don\u2019t believe in science\u201d, Ulibarri said.Many independents recoiled, as well. Moore falls in that category. \u201cNormally I go through, and I don\u2019t care if candidates are Republicans or Democrats \u2013 I do my research on whose viewpoints I agree with,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, the GOP \u2013 not Republicans but the party itself \u2013 has gone too far, too far right. They\u2019ve been ridiculous with the choices they\u2019re making \u2013 the party needs a reset.\u201d Among other things, \u201cwe need our leaders figuring out: how do we live in a world that\u2019s going to get even hotter?\u201d he added. This year, he picked Democrats up and down the ballot. Ultimately, Republicans\u2019 resistance to acknowledging and addressing climate change will hurt them politically, said Jeff Flake, a former Arizona senator. \u201cI do think over time it really makes it difficult to attract, particularly, the younger generation, millennials, Gen Xers, and whoever else, when we don\u2019t have rational policies on climate change,\u201d said Flake, a Republican who has been critical of Trump\u2019s politics. With so much else going on, he said that while he doesn\u2019t see climate change playing a big role in this election, he imagines it will be hard to ignore in future ones. \u2018We\u2019re building the political power\u2019 Like many areas of the country, in Maricopa, poor neighborhoods and neighborhoods where Latino and Black families live are worst affected by both the heat and the bad air. Across the US, young voters and Latino voters are especially likely to prioritize climate action, polling shows. \u201cLatinos are more convinced climate change is real and that it\u2019s human caused, more worried about it, and more supportive of action than any other voting bloc,\u201d said Leiserowitz of Yale. In Maricopa, where about one third of the county\u2019s 4.5 million residents identify as Latino, environmental justice activists are at the forefront of efforts to galvanize voters to elect environmentally minded candidates. \u201cOur focus is on getting young people, Latino people, people of color across our state who have traditionally been less engaged in the political process,\u201d Dent said. \u201cWe are making calls, we are sending mail and digital ads, text messages and handwritten postcards.\u201d Translating concern about climate change into votes has proved challenging in the past, but as the region grows hotter, and more polluted, \u201cwe\u2019re building the political power\u201d, she said. The county earned an \u201cF\u201d rating this year from the American Lung Association. The cars and trucks that congest the city\u2019s sprawling highways have made Phoenix the seventh-most ozone-polluted metropolitan area in the country. Here, the heat speeds up production of the toxic ozone particles, which can damage the lungs and lead to serious, even deadly respiratory issues. \u201cFor a decade, we in our communities have been raising our voices about these issues,\u201d said Blanca Abarca, 54, a community activist. Abarca lives in a largely Latino neighborhood in south Phoenix located downwind of an industrial dump the EPA has found is leeching \u201clow levels\u201d of toxic compounds and heavy metals including arsenic, barium, mercury, and nickel. She, her husband and their teenage daughter have MacGyvered their whole house to cope with the heat. They rely on a swamp cooler, ventilators on their roof and ceiling, and the trees they planted all around their house. They\u2019ve got an AC unit - but they hardly use it. The high electricity bills could send them into debt. \u201cI tell people who can vote to do it for the community \u2013 to elect leaders who are going to better this great country, and for the future of our children,\u201d she said while on a break from gardening at Spaces of Opportunity, a community farm in south Phoenix where she and many others in the neighborhood come for a respite from heat. To be clear, she added, that is not how she would characterize the current president. Her efforts \u2013 and those of other progressive Latino activists \u2013 have been paying off. Young Latino voters have been casting ballots in record numbers in recent years, helping elect Democratic lawmakers in local and statewide elections. In 2019, the Democrat Kate Gallego was elected mayor of Phoenix \u2013 in part thanks to a wave of young, progressive Latino voters. Gallego has a bachelor\u2019s degree in environmental science. \u201cI grew up with asthma. And as you spend time wheezing by the track, it gives you an opportunity to reflect on air quality,\u201d she said. Since taking office, Gallego has focused on developing better public transportation infrastructure to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. She\u2019s also overseeing the development of a network of \u201ccool corridors\u201d \u2013 to ensure that no resident is more than five minutes from water and shade. In another sign of progress, Arizona utility regulators this week approved a plan to transition to 100% carbon-free energy sources \u2013 such as solar and nuclear energy \u2013 by 2050. Two Republicans on the utilities board voted with a Democrat to get the measure passed. In the desert, \u201cwe just have to take climate change very seriously\u201d, Gallego said. \u201cAnd, you know, I have a father who fancies himself a political consultant,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd he told me if I can just do something about the summer heat, I will definitely be re-elected.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
