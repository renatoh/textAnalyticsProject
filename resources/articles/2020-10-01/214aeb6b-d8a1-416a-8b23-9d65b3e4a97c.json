We\u2019re closing this blog now but will be back with all the developments in US political news, as it happens, tomorrow. Here are the main events of the day: Alaska\u2019s Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has hopped off the fence and says she will confirm Amy Coney Barrett for the US supreme court in the vote expected on Monday. Barack Obama, speaking at a drive-in rally to support Joe Biden in the key swing state of Florida, laid into Donald Trump for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris, campainging in Ohio, also decried the Trump administration\u2019s handling of Covid-19 and lamented that the crushed economy has led to a \u201chunger crisis\u201d in America. Campaigning at two rallies in Pennsylvania today, Joe Biden said at each that he would not ban fracking - a very active industry in the swing state. Top infectious disease public health official Anthony Fauci supports the idea of a national face mask mandate if that\u2019s the only way to get people to wear them and curb the spread of coronavirus. Both Donald Trump and his most controversial coronavirus adviser Scott Atlas have been spreading misleading info on Twitter about Covid-19. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris is calling for an administration that is frank about racist police brutality in America. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a Black man I know, be it a relative or friend, who has not had some sort of experience with police that\u2019s been about an unreasonable stop, some sort of profiling or excessive force,\u201d she said. She said Donald Trump \u201csays people who are protesting are looters and they are violent, and talking about law and order, not understanding that peaceful protest is part of how this nation was founded.\u201d Harris said peaceful protest is what has allowed her to become only the second Black woman elected to the United States Senate (hat tip to groundbreaker Carol Moseley Braun). \u201cBut there is still a lot of work to be done\u201d not just to speak out about police brutality but to do something about it.\u201d She said she had spoken out about Breonna Taylor, shot dead by police in March during a botched raid on her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment, \u201cbut there are many Breonnas and Georges\u201d, referring to George Floyd who was killed by police in Minneapolis this spring when an officer kneeled on his neck on the ground for almost nine minutes, reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThere needs to be ban on chokeholds and carotid holds, across the board. Let\u2019s have a national registry of police officers who break the law.\u201d She added that there needed to be \u201caccountability and consequences\u201d not just for individual police but for \u201cthe system\u201d. The latest CNN opinion poll in Ohio has Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump in a statistical dead heat, with 46% of those surveyed backing Biden for the White House in November, 47% favoring Trump. No Republican in modern history has lost Ohio but won the White House. The 2020 race continues. Donald Trump is on his way to begin another rally in Circleville, Ohio, about a 30-minute drive from Columbus, and Joe Biden is speaking now in Dallas, north-eastern Pennsylvania. This Dallas is not far from Scranton, Biden\u2019s birthplace. The Democratic candidate for president just said \u201cmaybe it\u2019s the Scranton in me\u201d that gives him \u201ca bit of a chip on my shoulder\u201d about Trump\u2019s flaunting of and focus on his own wealth. Biden is at his most fired up on the campaign trail right now, he doesn\u2019t have the oratory skills of Obama, but he is impassioned. After so many months in the basement, campaigning online, it\u2019s truly exciting to see Biden, as well as Harris and Obama out on the trail in person talking to motivated voters - not leaving it all to Trump. Biden just said once again that he won\u2019t ban fracking. And he\u2019s slamming Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He\u2019s using what has become one of his standard lines, bringing up the revelation from Bob Woodward\u2019s book Rage that the president told him very early on in the outbreak that he knew exactly how dangerous Covid-19 was but downplayed it to the public because he didn\u2019t want to spread panic (instead his stance just spread coronavirus). \u201cThe American people don\u2019t panic,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump panicked.\u201d He called the president\u2019s approach to controlling the outbreak \u201cweak and chaotic\u201d. Biden said he is determined to shut down the virus if he is president, without shutting down the economy, although it\u2019s not entirely clear yet how he would thread that needle for the nation. Biden said Trump \u201chasn\u2019t delivered on a damn thing\u201d. Voters honking their car horns and cheering. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett won crucial backing this afternoon when one of the last Republican holdouts announced her support for Donald Trump\u2019s pick ahead of a confirmation vote expected Monday. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said during today\u2019s Senate session that while she opposed her party\u2019s decision to push ahead with the nomination process so close to the November 3 presidential election, she supported the federal judge, who is on track to lock in a conservative court majority for years to come, The Associated Press reports. Barrett already appeared to have enough votes for confirmation from Senate Republicans who hold the majority in the chamber and are racing to install her on the high court before Election Day. But Murkowski\u2019s nod gives her a boost of support. Only one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is now expected to oppose the conservative judge. \u201cWhile I oppose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her,\u201d Murkowski said. The Senate opened the rare weekend session despite Democratic efforts to stall Trump\u2019s nominee. Democrats mounted more procedural hurdles during the day, but the party has no realistic chance of stopping Barrett\u2019s advance. Barrett, a federal appeals court judge from Indiana, is expected to be confirmed Monday and quickly join the court. The fast-track confirmation process is like none other in US history so close to a presidential election. Democrats, notably the vice-presidential nominee and California Senator Kamala Harris, who sits on the judiciary committee, call it a \u201csham\u201d and say the winner of the presidential election should name the nominee to fill the vacancy left by the recent death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Senators planned to stay in session Saturday and Sunday. Read the Guardian\u2019s latest report on the Amy Coney Barrett. Not only is her confirmation process controversial but she is a controversial judge and individual. Here\u2019s our last report on Barack Obama\u2019s rally in Florida on behalf of Joe Biden today. In his speech, which lasted almost an hour, he worked through several major election issues, such as the economy and the pandemic and touched on others as he continued to lash Trump. \u201cLet me just see a show of hands, how many people here have a secret Chinese bank account?\u201d Obama asked, referring to a story that emerged in the week that Trump had paid more than $200,000 in taxes in China, weeks after it emerged his federal income tax liability in the US was far less. \u201cHis first year in the White House he only paid $750 in federal income tax,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got secretaries, you\u2019ve got construction workers, you got your health care workers, nurses, who pay a lot more in income taxes than that.\u201d There was a staunch defense of Obamacare, his signature Affordable Care Act, which provided millions more Americans with affordable health insurance, that Republicans have tried numerous times to dismantle during the Trump administration. \u201cWhen they\u2019re asked about it they say, \u2018Well look, we\u2019re gonna have a great replacement. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s gonna be there in two weeks.\u2019 They\u2019ve never had a replacement. Nothing. Nada. Zero. Zilch. \u201cThey\u2019ve attacked the Affordable Care Act and every time they\u2019ve driven up costs, they\u2019re driving up the uninsured. Now they\u2019re trying to get the Supreme Court to take away your health care as we speak, in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d referring to the high court\u2019s hearing into the constitutionality of the ACA on 10 November. Appealing to Florida\u2019s sizeable Hispanic demographic, Obama had harsh words for Trump\u2019s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, and efforts by some among Miami\u2019s Cuban and Venezuelan communities to portray Biden as an extreme socialist. \u201cListening to the Republicans, you\u2019d think Joe was more communist than the Castros. Don\u2019t fall for that garbage,\u201d Obama said. \u201cFolks would know if he was a secret socialist by now. What is true is he\u2019ll promote human rights in Cuba and around the world and he won\u2019t coddle dictators the way our current president does.\u201d The former prescient ended on an upbeat note. \u201cI\u2019m here to report that America is a good and decent place. We just see so much noise and nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard for us to remember but I\u2019ve been all across this country. There are a lot of good people here. There are a lot of folks who share the values of looking out for one another and doing right by one another.\u201d Here we go again with Donald Trump\u2019s antipathy to the wearing of face masks to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. Having just arrived in Columbus, Ohio, for his next campaign trail event, the president had a few words with reporters and is talking utter nonsense. First he said there are so many cases of coronavirus being reported in Wisconsin, where the disease is surging, at the moment because of all the testing. So if no testing, then no coronavirus? This is a highly misleading and wrongheaded argument that the president of the United States has tried numerous times over the months in order to downplay the coronavirus pandemic. And at a question from another reporter, Trump barked: \u201cI can\u2019t hear you with your mask on\u201d and moved to the next reporter without waiting for the person to repeat the question. The Texas state supreme court this afternoon temporarily reinstated the governor\u2019s ban on multiple drop-off sites for mail ballots, in a short-term victory for Donald Trump. The ban will remain in effect while the state supreme court fully reviews a Friday appeals court ruling that overturned the order by Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican like the president, who faces Democrat Joe Biden in a race for the White House on November 3, Reuters writes. The Texas 3rd court of appeals had unanimously agreed with a lower court that limiting the number of drop boxes would lengthen lines, increase the risk that voters could get infected with Covid-19, and infringe on their right to vote. Trump has repeatedly criticized mail-in ballots, claiming - without evidence - they would lead to widespread fraud. Abbott issued his order limiting mail-in ballot drop boxes to one per county on October 1, saying it was aimed at preventing fraud. The move, which closed more than a dozen satellite locations in at least two counties, drew condemnation from Democrats and voting rights advocates. Texas, which Trump won by nine percentage points in 2016, has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in more than four decades. But opinion polls have suggested it might be in reach for Biden, in part because of dissatisfaction over Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Guardian\u2019s Erum Salam noted in this story from earlier in the month that large, populous counties such as Travis and Harris county will be disproportionately affected by Abbott\u2019s order. These counties includes Texas\u2019s most diverse cities: Austin and Houston, respectively. Nine per cent of Travis county\u2019s population are black and 33% are Hispanic. In Harris county, 20% of the population are black and 43% Hispanic. Harris county is the third most populous county in the country with more than 4.7 million residents. As of 2018, it has nearly 2.4 million registered voters. After Abbott\u2019s new order, the vast county has gone from having 12 ballot drop-off sites to just one, located at the NRG Stadium in central Houston. Full story here. Richard Luscombe writes that Barack Obama is delivering a sparky speech at a drive-in rally for Joe Biden in North Miami, Florida. His event continues with him highlighting the difference between Trump\u2019s \u201cempty promises\u201d for a second term and Biden\u2019s plans for his first. \u201cTweeting\u2026 doesn\u2019t fix things. Inventing conspiracies doesn\u2019t make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a plan. You\u2019ve got to do the work. And along with the experience of getting things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that are going to turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality.\u201d Seeking to heap blame on Trump\u2019s lack of response for a coronavirus pandemic that has killed almost 225,000 Americans and cost millions of jobs, Obama pointed out that his own administration had left plans. \u201cWe literally left this White House a pandemic playbook that showed them how to respond before a virus reached our shores,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt must be lost along with the Republican health care plan. We can\u2019t find it, eight months into this pandemic.\u201d Also squandered, Obama said, was the nation\u2019s strong economy: \u201cUnemployment was steadily going down during the Obama-Biden presidency. And then he gets elected and it keeps on going down and suddenly he says, \u2018Look what I did there.\u2019 \u201cHe did inherit the longest streak of job growth in American history that we got started but just like everything else he inherited he fumbled it. \u201cThe economic damage inflicted by [his] pandemic response means that Donald Trump will be the first president since Herbert Hoover that actually loses jobs.\u201d Obama also teased Trump for ending his interview early for 60 Minutes, with journalist Lesley Stahl, early. The interview airs tomorrow night, ditto one with Biden. A quick reminder that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have threatened to sue the Lincoln Project, if the anti-Trump Republicans do not remove two huge billboards from Times Square in New York City, in which they accuse the senior White House advisers of showing \u201cindifference\u201d to Americans suffering and dying under Covid-19. Saying the billboards would stay up, the group called Kushner and Trump \u201centitled, out-of-touch bullies, who have never given the slightest indication they have any regard for the American people\u201d. My colleague Martin Pengelly has just updated the story with the following: In an email to the Guardian on Saturday, Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said: \u201cIt does seem unlikely that Ivanka and Jared would actually sue the Lincoln Project, especially before election day, while after that hopefully they won\u2019t care, can return to New York and stop pretending to be public servants. \u201cHer father has honed litigation abuse as a business person and president, to an art form,\u201d Tobias added, but \u201cif they did sue, the litigation might take years to resolve, be expensive and lead to embarrassing revelations \u2026 suits like this by people who have thrust themselves into the public eye are notoriously difficult to win. \u201cIn short, this appears to be the usual Trump family bluster.\u201d Read the full story here: And here\u2019s the latest tweet from the project: Barack Obama is wasting no time in mocking Donald Trump during the former Democratic president\u2019s appearance in North Miami, Florida this afternoon. \u201cHe\u2019s had a tough week. Everybody has been very unfair to Donald Trump, this week,\u201d the former president said to joyous honks of car horns at a drive-in rally. Referring to the final presidential debate between Trump and Joe Biden on Thursday, Obama said: \u201cTrump was asked, \u2018What is your plan for the new phase of Covid?\u2019 which is a pretty good question considering that we just saw the highest number of cases spike up yesterday. \u201cSo you think he\u2019d be ready for a response. Instead, he just said it wasn\u2019t his fault, he didn\u2019t have one. He said, \u2018It\u2019s now gone and a bunch of states.\u2019 Just as states are reaching new record highs nationwide he doesn\u2019t have a plan. He doesn\u2019t even acknowledge the reality of what\u2019s taking place all across the country.\u201d As he did earlier in the week at a rally in Pennsylvania for Biden, his former vice-president, Obama kept the focus firmly on Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to have an answer to this question. It\u2019s a good idea if you\u2019re running for reelection to say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I want to accomplish.\u201d What did Trump say? He got mad and walked out of the interview,\u201d Obama said, referring to an ill-tempered 60 Minutes due to air on CBS Sunday night but already posted on Trump\u2019s Facebook site. \u201cHe thought the questions were too tough. If he can\u2019t answer a tough question like, \u2018What would you like to do in your second term?\u2019 then it\u2019s our job to make sure he doesn\u2019t get a second term.\u201d Obama said he didn\u2019t know Biden very well when he picked him to be his Veep. But he said he got to know his character as their administration proceeded, and that Biden \u201cmade me a better president\u201d. Also campaigning today in Pennsylvania is Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s out on the trail for Joe Biden, who defeated him in the primary process this spring to become the Democratic nominee for president. Here\u2019s a post from the Sanders event from the Democratic councilwoman at large for Allegheny county, Bethany Hallam. Hallam has become a little bit famous of late for her unique campaign to persuade voters in Pennsylvania to be careful to enclose their mail-in ballots in the privacy envelope issued by the state, inside the outer envelope, if you follow me. Read all about it here. And in North Carolina, former Democratic presidential candidate and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is campaigning today to help get Joe Biden elected next month. More from Edward Helmore\u2026 Facebook has demanded that New York University stop collecting data about its political ad targeting practices, arguing the engineering project violates its terms of service. The argument between the social media giant and NYU\u2019s Ad Observatory project, which launched last month with more 6,500 volunteers assigned to collect data about political ads, flared up on Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal. In a letter to the engineering department, Facebook said \u201cscraping tools, no matter how well-intentioned, are not a permissible means of collecting information from us\u201d. Facebook went on to say that if the university does not cease harvesting the data and delete it, it \u201cmay be subject to additional enforcement action\u201d. Last month, Facebook said it would stop political advertising for a month ahead the 3 November presidential election, seeking to prevent the spread of misinformation. After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, Facebook was accused of allowing Russian disinformation and political profiling to flow almost unchecked. NYU has said the Ad Observatory is designed to provide the public, journalists, researchers and policy makers with the ability to search political ads floated to specific audiences and to see how those ads are funded. Facebook\u2019s demand that NYU cease the program met with criticism. \u201cFacebook is making it harder for Americans to get information about online political ads,\u201d Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, a sponsor of a bill called the Honest Ads Act, said in a statement to the Journal. Social media platforms, she added, have pledged to make online advertising more transparent \u2013 but Facebook\u2019s threatened action \u201cis further evidence that voluntary standards are insufficient\u201d. After the Journal\u2019s article was published, Facebook partially retracted its threat, signaling the sensitivity of the issue. It said it would not take any action until after the election. The Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, is offering a searing view of the Trump presidency in Cleveland, Ohio, right now. She decries, loudly and in a sharply scathing tone, Donald Trump\u2019s having politicized mask-wearing in relation to the coronavirus pandemic, when the president indicates that if you don\u2019t wear a mask you\u2019re for Trump, if you wear one then you are against him. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d she asks rhetorically. She\u2019s talking as Barack Obama just took the stage at a drive-in rally in North Miami, Florida, where the former president just jogged in wearing a \u201cVOTE\u201d mask. Harris, in the swing state of Ohio, went on to describe Trump as the kind of vain man \u201cwho looks in the mirror rather than looking into the faces of the American people.\u201d \u201cAnd so we find ourselves in this crisis,\u201d she said. With the pandemic decimating the public health and the economy, Harris said that in Ohio right now, one in 10 families are concerned that they don\u2019t have enough food, one in six families are concerned that they won\u2019t be able to pay the rent next month, and one in five businesses have closed \u201cwith no prospect of being able to reopen.\u201d \u201cWe are in the middle of a hunger crisis in America,\u201d the California Senator said. She called the Trump presidency the greatest failure of an administration in US history. New Yorkers are jamming polling places and standing in line for hours to cast ballots on the state\u2019s first day of early voting today. They are rushing to record their choices 10 days ahead of the November 3 presidential election, Reuters reports. Lines formed before polls opened across New York City and neighboring Long Island, videos on social media showed, as New Yorkers joined a flood of more than 56 million Americans across the country who have cast early ballots at a record-setting pace. Saturday was the first time that voters in New York, a reliably Democratic state where Democrat Joe Biden has a wide lead in polls over the Republican president, Donald Trump, have been allowed to vote early in a presidential election. A majority of New York voters haven\u2019t supported a Republican candidate for president since Ronald Reagan\u2019s re-election in 1984. Early in-person voting will continue in the state until November 1. \u201cPatiently waiting for Mommy to vote early!\u201d the New York City Board of Elections tweeted, showing a photo of a young girl sitting in line with a drawing book. About 56.1 million Americans already have cast early ballots across the country either in person or by mail, a pace that could lead to the highest voter turnout rate in more than a century, according to data from the US Elections Project. The high level of early voting has led Michael McDonald, the University of Florida professor who administers the US Elections Project, to predict a record turnout of about 150 million, representing 65% of eligible voters, the highest participation rate since 1908. Donald Trump\u2019s long-sought after tax records, obtained by the New York Times, appear to show he may have given far less to philanthropic causes than he has claimed. According to the documents, the Times reports, Trump has given at least $130m since 2005. But the majority of that total, $119.3m, came from simply agreeing not to move forward on land development projects. In three cases the agreements, known as conservation easements, came after Trump had abandoned the projects but was permitted under US law to keep title and receive a tax deduction equal to their appraised value. Trump\u2019s tax records, the Times also reported, show that much of his charitable giving has come during periods of financial or public-image duress, including as he faced high tax bills from earnings related to his long-running reality TV series, The Apprentice. One land deal, currently being investigated by the New York attorney general, involves land donated for a state park. The investigation focuses on whether the appraisal used to secure a tax easement was improperly inflated. According to an earlier report at least four Trump properties \u2013 the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, a 212-acre Seven Springs estate in Westchester county, New York, the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and a skyscraper at 40 Wall Street in Manhattan \u2013 are being reviewed by state and federal authorities for potential tax, debt or insurance irregularities. The latest reporting contributes to a perception that Trump\u2019s claims to philanthropic largesse are inflated or misleading at best. His charitable foundation was shut down two years ago. Former New York attorney general Barbara Underwood said at the time the foundation functioned \u201cas little more than a checkbook to serve Mr Trump\u2019s business and political interests\u201d, and had engaged in \u201ca shocking pattern of illegality.\u201d The current New York attorney general, Letitia James, is investigating whether the Trump Organization falsely reported property values to secure loans or tax benefits. Investigators with her office this month deposed Eric Trump, the organization\u2019s executive vice president, in what is currently a civil matter. The president\u2019s son described the investigation as \u201cthe highest level of prosecutorial misconduct\u201d. In response to questions posed by the Times about public philanthropic promises that appear either to have been exaggerated or non-existent, Trump Organization spokeswoman Amanda Miller said: \u201cPresident Trump gives money privately. It\u2019s impossible to know how much he\u2019s given over the years.\u201d Everyone\u2019s on the move. Donald Trump is en route from North Carolina to his next campaign event, in Ohio, and Joe Biden has another rally in Pennsylvania, this one featuring rock god Jon Bon Jovi, who 10 years ago described himself to the Observer (the Guardian\u2019s sister Sunday newspaper) as \u201coverweight, drinking too much and bored to tears\u201d! And very soon, Barack Obama is speaking at a drive-in rally in support of Joe Biden in Florida. Obama began hitting the campaign trail in person a few days ago, giving a blistering critique of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency at a raucous rally in Philadelphia. The timing appeared very strategic - don\u2019t campaign too early as if your former vice-president needs rescuing, but skid in for the closing when Biden has a strong lead in the polls but some of those last few swing voters in key states are still deciding which way to go.... Here\u2019s Lauren Gambino\u2019s report on that event in Philly. Richard Luscombe will bring us some reporting from Obama\u2019s event in North Miami in a few minutes. Joe Biden is repeating that he has no plans to ban hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state where many jobs depend on the industry. Speaking at a drive-in rally on the grounds of a community college in Bristol, near Philadelphia, earlier The Assocated Press reports that he said: \u201cLet me be clear, I\u2019m not banning fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else.\u201d People in about 100 cars blared their horns. Still, Biden noted that climate change could lead to more catastrophic floods in places like along the nearby Delaware River. \u201cWe can do something about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to come together.\u201d Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Biden of supporting a ban on fracking. Biden mistakenly suggested during a Democratic presidential primary debate that he did, but his campaign quickly corrected that. The former vice president has promised to end fracking on federal land. Biden also said during this week\u2019s presidential debate with Trump that the country would have to \u201ctransition away from the oil industry\u201d to combat climate change -- something he didn\u2019t mention at his rally today. Biden has since clarified that the process would be gradual and not cost people who rely on the energy sector their jobs. The comment pleased environmentalists but drew criticism from Republicans and even some national Democratic politicians in close congressional races in oil country. Jill Biden wore a \u201cvote\u201d mask to the rally this morning - here\u2019s a reminder of the great Guardian piece from a few weeks ago about \u201cvote\u201d fashion. The war of words on the campaign trail is heating up. Donald Trump is still talking in North Carolina, about an hour in, in 82F heat under sunny skies (according to the pool report - your blogger is in the cloudy, cool Big Apple) and the president is mocking Democratic rival Joe Biden\u2019s drive-in rallies and the focus on the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said all he hears about is \u201cCovid, Covid, Covid\u201d asserting that on November 4, the day after the election, the topic will disappear from headlines and Biden\u2019s utterances. That seems unlikely as the autumn surge in cases continues across the country, and dire warnings from experts that the death toll, which is currently 224,000 in the US, could more than double to 500,000 in the next four months. Those attending Trump\u2019s rally lined up for hours and can be seen on the television failing to keep social distance or wear a mask, while also hugging each other and cheering loudly. Biden held one of his drive-in rallies in Pennsylvania earlier, where voters listen from their cars and cheer, clap and honk in appreciation while keeping away from each other in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. \u201cPeople in cars. People in cars!\u201d Trump said sarcastically of Biden\u2019s methods, getting his crowd chuckling. Some Trump supporters in cars made a point of creating a hullabaloo close to Biden\u2019s rally, interrupting the candidate, who called them \u201cchumps\u201d. Just 10 days to go, folks. Meanwhile, Barack Obama is getting ready to hold a drive-in rally for Biden in North Miami within the hour. Meanwhile, top infectious diseases expert and the leading public health official on the White House coronavirus task force, Anthony Fauci, has suggested in his latest interview that it could be time to mandate mask-wearing across American in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. With the pandemic still out of control and infections rising, Fauci expressed exasperation. \u201cIf people are not wearing masks, then maybe we should be mandating it,\u201d Fauci told CNN later yesterday. The doctor has been reluctant to talk about a national mandate, hoping that information campaigns, local efforts and facts about the effectiveness of masks would sway the public. Now he appears to be running out of optimism that common sense will prevail. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a difficulty enforcing it, but if everyone agrees that this is something that\u2019s important and they mandate it and everybody pulls together and says, you know, we\u2019re going to mandate it but let\u2019s just do it, I think that would be a great idea to have everybody do it uniformly,\u201d he said last night. Unfortunately, Fauci has been undermined all along the way by Donald Trump and now by the president\u2019s newest official adviser, Scott Atlas (see previous post), whom Fauci has acknowledged is being allowed to edge him out and capture the president\u2019s ear. Fauci also said late Thursday that Trump hasn\u2019t met with the whole task force for months and whereas the White House coronavirus task force met daily earlier in the pandemic they are now only being convened about once a week. While the US is surging towards record numbers of new coronavirus infections that could exceed the grim threshold of 100,000 cases a day, Donald Trump\u2019s most controversial official White House coronavirus adviser, Scott Atlas, has put out a tweet, backing up misleading information from the president. CNN\u2019s ace fact-checker Daniel Dale is not having any of it. The country set a record daily number of new coronavirus cases on Friday at more than 83,000, eclipsing the previous high set on 16 July by more than 6,000. Dozens of states have reported their own surge in numbers, with the governor of Utah, Gary Herbert, warning that health services are at breaking point. \u201cUp until now, our hospitals have been able to provide good care to all Covid and non-Covid patients who need it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today we stand on the brink. \u201cIf Utahans do not take serious steps to limit group gatherings and wear masks, our healthcare providers will not have the ability to provide quality care for everyone who needs it.\u201d Good afternoon, Joanna Walters in New York now taking over the reins from my colleague Bryan Armen Graham. Trump just arrived in Lumberton, North Carolina, and has begun addressing a rally there. He\u2019s out of the gate with an entirely unsubstantiated assertion (and a split infinitive) that: \u201cWe are going to quickly end this pandemic.\u201d Trump also remarks to the crowd that the sun is hot and he might have to cut his speech short because: \u201cI\u2019m going to be a lobster\u201d. The crowd is having a whale of a time. And then, Christmas greetings. Joe Biden told a rally crowd in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania that he misses up-close campaigning, but doesn\u2019t want his supporters to become \u201csuperspreaders\u201d. \u201cI wish I could go car to car and meet you all,\u201d the former vice-president said at the top of his 25min remarks. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of all this distance but it\u2019s necessary. I appreciate you being safe. What we don\u2019t want to do is become superspreaders.\u201d Biden\u2019s speech at a drive-in event at Bucks County Community College in the Philadelphia suburb of Bristol came as Donald Trump embarked on a three-state, three-rally jaunt in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin as campaign season hurtles down the homestretch with early voting under way in all 50 states. A Rose Garden event in late September has been labeled a \u201csuperspreader\u201d for the virus. More than two dozen people linked to the White House have contracted Covid-19 since the president\u2019s reception on 26 September announcing Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to the US supreme court. The US Senate has convened a rare weekend session to continue debate over the confirmation of federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court. Democrats have expressed outrage at the vacancy being filled so close to the election \u2013 in fact boycotting Thursday\u2019s vote to advance her nomination to the full Senate \u2013 but the Republicans\u2019 53-37 majority in the upper chamber ensures they have the votes they need to approve her nomination and cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court for years to come. No supreme court nominee has ever been installed so close to a presidential election and, just four years ago, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and senator Lindsey Graham, who now chairs the judiciary committee, said that installing a nominee in an election year would be a shameful defiance of the will of voters. Barrett, 48, is expected to be confirmed Monday and quickly join the court. Barack Obama was promising to step up for his former vice-president with an appearance in Miami on Saturday afternoon. The problem is nobody seems to know exactly when or where. Democrats have posted only vague details about the event on social media, leaving in the dark hordes of supporters keen to hear the most recent president speak. Not even the hometown Miami Herald appeared to be in the picture, noting only that Obama \u201cplanned a drive-in rally Saturday in North Miami\u201d. \u201cDoes anyone know where in Miami Obama is going to be at,\u201d one woman asked on Twitter on Saturday lunchtime, echoing dozens of similar messages from baffled supporters. Others speculated there were no details because the event was invite only. The Florida Democratic Party, meanwhile, isn\u2019t saying either way. Florida, a traditional battleground state which Obama carried in his successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns, is crucial to both candidates\u2019 hopes of winning the White House. Donald Trump flipped the state back red in 2016 but trails Biden in latest polls, albeit by a percentage inside the margin of error. National Guard soldiers in the North Dakota capital of Bismarck have helped notify 800 people who tested positive for the coronavirus but initially weren\u2019t told due to a backlog of cases, the AP reports. The backlog was due to a recent sharp increase in coronavirus cases. North Dakota leads the nation with more than 1,272 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to the COVID Tracking Project. This week, North Dakota National Guard soldiers began telling people they tested positive for the virus. They previously were informing people who had contact with someone positive and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of the virus. North Dakota reported 886 new infections on Friday, down from a record 1,038 cases on Thursday. Health officials reported nine deaths Friday, increasing the statewide death toll to 440. A surge of coronavirus cases in Wisconsin and the Dakotas is forcing a scramble for hospital beds and raising political tensions, as the upper midwest has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s most troubling hotspots. Johns Hopkins University has reported 79,963 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, a record, although the number of daily deaths has remained broadly stable since the beginning of autumn at between 700 and 800. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said \u201ctoo many countries are seeing an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close to or above capacity - and we\u2019re still only in October.\u201d The message was echoed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), whose director, Andrea Ammon, spoke of a \u201chighly concerning epidemiological situation\u201d. The Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus has killed at least 1,145,847 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. At least 42,262,290 cases have been registered, of which at least 28,754,900 are now considered recovered. The tallies, using data collected from national authorities and WHO, probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases. On Friday, 482,954 new cases and 6,366 new deaths and were recorded worldwide. Donald Trump has just cast his ballot in the 2020 presidential election at a library in West Palm Beach not far from his Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cIt was a very secure vote, much more secure than when you send in a ballot, I can tell you that,\u201d the US president says. \u201cEverything was perfect. Very strict, by the rules. When you send in your ballot, it can never be like that. It could never be secure like that.\u201d Early voting began in Florida on Monday. More than 52m Americans have already voted, according to the Election Project. Asked by a reporter which candidate he voted for, he smiles and says: \u201cI voted for a guy named Trump.\u201d A busy Saturday lies ahead with 10 days to do until election day: three rallies in three states (North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin). A fascinating and troubling read from Johnny Kaufmann in Georgia, part of our ongoing series The Fight to Vote: Tariq Baiyina has lobbied politicians, shaken hands with governors, set up a college program, and delivered dozens of sermons. Despite all this, the 42-year-old has never voted. And the reason is simple: since 2002, when he was convicted of a felony, he hasn\u2019t been allowed. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have threatened to sue the Lincoln Project, if the group of anti-Trump Republicans do not remove two huge billboards from Times Square in New York City, in which the White House advisers are accused of showing callous disregard for Americans suffering under the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, the Project posted to Twitter a letter from Marc Kasowitz, an attorney who has represented Donald Trump. \u201cI am writing concerning the false, malicious and defamatory ads that the Lincoln Project is displaying on billboards in Times Square,\u201d Kasowitz wrote. \u201cThose ads show Ms Trump smiling and gesturing toward a death count of Americans and New Yorkers, and attribute to Mr Kushner the statement that \u201c[New Yorkers] are going to suffer and that\u2019s their problem\u201d \u2026 with body bags underneath. \u201cOf course, Mr Kushner never made any such statement, Ms Trump never made any such gesture, and the Lincoln Project\u2019s representation that they did are an outrageous and shameful libel.\u201d The Lincoln Project\u2019s response, posted by members including the former GOP strategist-turned-bestselling author Rick Wilson, was typically pugnacious. \u201cThe level of indignant outrage Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump have shown towards the Lincoln Project for exposing their indifference for the more than 223,000 people who have lost their lives due to the reckless mismanagement of Covid-19 is comical,\u201d a statement said. \u201c\u2026The billboards will stay up. We consider it important that in Times Square, the crossroads of the world, people are continuously reminded of the cruelty or density and staggering lack of empathy the Trumps and the Kushners have displayed towards the American people.\u201d On 22 October, almost three weeks before one of the most consequential presidential elections in recent history, more than 6 million Californians had already voted. The number was several times that of the same point in 2016. The pandemic, massive wildfires and the ongoing fight against police brutality have galvanized voters in America\u2019s most populous state. \u201cWe knew the Covid-19 pandemic would pose significant challenges, but elections officials have prepared and voters have responded,\u201d said Alex Padilla, the secretary of state. California has sent mail-in ballots to 22 million registered voters, and the flood of votes that have been returned so far make up about 25%. It\u2019s still unclear whether voter turnout will be higher than in previous years. But the early turnout is \u201cshattering prior election returns\u201d, said Paul Mitchell of Political Data, a bipartisan voter data firm based in California. \u201cWe\u2019ve been tracking this kind of stuff for over a decade, and there\u2019s just nothing that compares to how quickly voters have been returning their ballots this election cycle.\u201d Here\u2019s some of the Associated Press report on yesterday\u2019s worrying coronavirus milestone in the US, a record caseload of more than 83,000 in one day. States from Connecticut to the Rocky Mountain West are reeling under the surge. The US death toll has grown to 223,995, according to Johns Hopkins University. The total US caseload reported on the site Friday was 83,757, topping 77,362 cases reported on 16 July. The impact is being felt in every section of the country \u2013 a lockdown at the Oglala Sioux reservation in South Dakota, a plea by a Florida health official for a halt to children\u2019s parties, dire warnings from Utah\u2019s governor, an increasingly desperate situation at a hospital in northern Idaho, which is running out of space and considering airlifts to Seattle or Oregon. \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially shut down an entire floor of our hospital. We\u2019ve had to double rooms. We\u2019ve bought more hospital beds,\u201d said Dr Robert Scoggins, a pulmonologist at the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d\u2019Alene. \u201cOur hospital is not built for a pandemic.\u201d Utah governor Gary Herbert proclaimed Friday \u201ca record day for Utah \u2013 but not a good one\u201d as cases reached an all-time high. \u201cUp until now, our hospitals have been able to provide good care to all Covid and non-Covid patients who need it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today we stand on the brink. If Utahans do not take serious steps to limit group gatherings and wear masks, our healthcare providers will not have the ability to provide quality care for everyone who needs it.\u201d By public health order, masks are required in 21 counties, said Herbert, urging Utah residents to wear one whenever they are around someone outside their immediate household. The seven-day rolling average for new daily cases in the US surpassed 61,140 on Thursday, compared with 44,647 two weeks ago. The record was reached on 22 July when the rolling average was 67,293. The head of the World Health Organization warned that countries in the northern hemisphere are at a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d. \u201cThe next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. According to scientists at the University of Washington, things could be about to get much, much worse: Joe Biden\u2019s remark in Thursday\u2019s final debate that he would support a \u201ctransition\u201d away from oil in the US, in favour of renewable energy, has given Trump an in \u2013 and he has tried to seize it. \u201cThat could be one of the biggest mistakes made in presidential debate history,\u201d the president said on Friday at a rally at The Villages, a retirement community in central Florida where thousands of people gathered outdoors on a polo field \u2013 most not wearing masks. Later, in Pensacola, Trump recounted the moment with glee. \u201cIt looked like he made it, it looked like it was going to be OK. He got off the stage, going back to his basement, and then they hit him with the energy question. They hit him with a thing called oil.\u201d Here\u2019s what Oliver Milman, an environment reporter, wrote for us on Friday: Biden attempted to mend potential political damage after the debate when he told reporters he wanted to end subsidies for fossil fuels rather than the industry itself. But two vulnerable House Democrats in oil-producing states, Kendra Horn in Oklahoma and Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico, quickly used Twitter to distance themselves from Biden\u2019s remarks, perhaps mindful of the persistent attacks on Hillary Clinton in 2016 when she was portrayed as being happy to eliminate coalmining jobs. Climate activists have pointed out that a phase-out of the oil industry is simply a logical consequence of Biden\u2019s climate action plan, which calls for 100% clean energy within 15 years and the negation of all planet-warming gases in the US by 2050. Even some major oil companies, such as BP, have embraced a similar goal of net zero by 2050. Scientists have warned that emissions must hit zero globally by mid-century to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis, including mass suffering and displacement of people due to heatwaves, flooding and wildfires. Biden\u2019s comments on the oil industry \u201cnow count as the conventional wisdom\u201d, said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the climate group 350.org. \u201cThat matters.\u201d States such as Texas, which Democrats are trying to shift from being reliably Republican, have large numbers of workers in the oil and petrochemical industries. But the economic and political terrain is shifting \u2013 Texas is also the largest wind energy-producing state in the US while polls show that nearly eight in 10 Americans want the country to focus on boosting renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, including a clear majority of Republican voters. \u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of the US presidential election, US politics in general and of course the coronavirus pandemic, ever a subject of political debate. There are 10 days to go until election day, and Donald Trump is trailing Joe Biden in most national and battleground polls, some deficits by more than 5%, suggesting that even polling inaccuracies of 2016 proportions might not see the president right the ship. This morning, Trump will vote in Florida, then travel to North Carolina. Here is a story about how one leading expert thinks turnout is heading to be the highest since 1908, early voting surging because of the pandemic \u2013 and perhaps because of Trump himself. More than 52m votes have been cast, with 100m or so more expected. It\u2019s a three-rally day for Trump, with Ohio and Wisconsin after North Carolina. According to the fivethirtyeight.com averages, he\u2019s a fraction ahead of Biden in Ohio, a fraction behind in North Carolina \u2013 and quite a long way behind in Wisconsin. Biden will be in Pennsylvania, where he also leads by more than 5%, for two drive-in rallies, one attended by \u2026 Jon Bon Jovi. \u201cTo continue our movementI am going to rely on you,\u201d Trump told supporters in Florida on Friday. \u201cGet out and vote. Vote early. Bring your friends, your family, your neighbors, your co-workers. Even grab your boss and say: \u2018Come on, boss. You got to vote.\u2019\u201d Don\u2019t, to put it efficiently, expect much evidence of Covid-19 mitigation measures at the Trump events today. Don\u2019t expect much discussion of how case numbers have now hit record highs \u2013 and could reach terrifying levels, according to one new report. More to come, of course, from me and other Guardian writers. In the meantime, here\u2019s something I helped Ed Pilkington write, about Trump\u2019s dirty tricks \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
