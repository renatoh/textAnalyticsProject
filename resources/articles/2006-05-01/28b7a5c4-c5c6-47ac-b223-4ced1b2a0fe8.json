And reports of half a million pupils in schools without headteachers are also wide of the mark (Figures expose shortfall on key Labour pledge, April 28). In 1997 large classes were a reality in one in five key stage 1 classrooms; today over 450,000 fewer key stage 1 pupils are in classes over 30. We will not hesitate to use our legal powers to ensure that the small minority of schools with oversize classes fulfil their obligations. Vacancy rates for headteachers stand at just 0.8% of schools, and we are providing the incentives, pay and professional development to attract and retain excellent headteachers. Pay rates have increased by some 35% since 1997 and over 14,000 people have completed the national professional qualification for headship. Jacqui Smith MP Schools minister As Meg Howarth highlights (Letters, April 25), the Liberal Democrat group on Norfolk county council has firmly opposed the government's academies programme from the outset, and recent Tory proposals to open a new academy here in Norwich. Question marks have already been raised over the quality of educational provision at the academies. But there are greater causes of apprehension than performance. Academies are run by trusts and are outside the control of the community. The sponsors control admissions, curriculum, teachers' pay and conditions, and the entire ethos of the institution and, as the teaching unions have warned, the proliferation of city academies could pave the way for unsound fundamentalist teaching and selection by the back door. The National Governors' Association has called for the suspension of all involvement in academy programmes. This week I will be urging all Norfolk county councillors to support the NGA and halt investigations into proposals for a Norwich academy. I hope that Liberal Democrat groups across the country will also be taking a similar line. Cllr Mervyn Scutter Lib Dem spokesman for children's services, Norfolk county council New Philanthropy Capital is wrong to claim (Report, April 25) an \u00a38m difference between the average cost of an academy and of other new secondary schools. Academies are built to similar specifications as other state schools. The average cost of a new secondary school with 1,300 pupils and a sixth form in a high cost inner-city area is \u00a325-30m. The average cost of an academy of this size and location is the same. About half of open academies are in London and most are built on restricted brownfield sites. It is absurd to compare the average cost of a 1,300 pupil academy, built in high cost, inner-city areas, with the \u00a315m, historic average price tag for a 900-pupil secondary school in a moderate cost area.
