The Conservatives see themselves presiding over an economic recovery \u2013 the OECD upgraded its 2014 UK growth forecast to 2.4% on Tuesday\u2013 but winning no political credit for it in the opinion polls and at the ballot box. That could change, of course. But the prospect has the party and its supporters rattled. And so it should. Part of the problem for the Tories is simply that they are ceasing to be a national party. Although Labour undoubtedly has its own problems, it remains a competitive presence in all parts of the United Kingdom. Not so the Tories. Since 1997, they have become inoculated to their lack of success in Scotland and, to a lesser extent, in Wales. But the once secure image of the Tories as the party of England is now taking a knock, too. Some of that is down to Ukip, which has run away with some of the Tories' traditional clothes. A lot of it, though, can be explained by the fact that the Tories now lack friends in the north. In 2010, the Tories won 20 of the 124 urban seats in the north and Midlands. But recent polls have provided striking evidence that the Conservatives are at risk of losing ground in the north the way they did in Scotland two decades ago. In one poll, 72% of northerners say the Tories do not understand their area well, while 25% say they do not know anyone who they think votes Conservative. In another poll, Tory unpopularity in the north of England is now on a par with their unpopularity in Scotland, where the Conservatives have only a single Westminster MP. The practical implications are obvious. It is hard enough for the Conservatives to win a Westminster majority without Scottish seats. It is that much harder, therefore, to win without northern English seats as well. Some smart Tories grasp this problem \u2013 though far too many others do not. One who understands, the planning minister Nick Boles, warned that his party risks being pushed back into \"a rural and suburban redoubt in the south of England\", although his favoured solution \u2013 the revival of the National Liberal party (in whose name Michael Heseltine once stood) as an affiliate to the Tories \u2013 hardly seems to measure up to the challenge. A more hard-headed recent suggestion, promoted by the Electoral Reform Society, was for the Tories to embrace proportional representation in local government elections as a way of halting their downward spiral in the north. But the underlying issue won't be solved by a fix of the voting system. To win a national election, the Tories will need to be a national party. At present, under a quintessentially southern English leader, they act and think too much as the southern party \u2013 which, increasingly, is what they are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
