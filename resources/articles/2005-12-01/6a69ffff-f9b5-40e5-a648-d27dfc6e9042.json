In fact, while she draws links between the National Socialist and Israeli concepts of nationhood, she rejects the analogy between the Nazi extermination of the Jews and Zionism. Charleston farmhouse, where the painter Duncan Grant lived until his death in 1978, was not then threatened with demolition, as we claimed in The beautiful science, page 9, November 24. It was Asham, the nearby house of Virginia Woolf, which was demolished to make way for a landfill site. It is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), not as it eccentrically appeared on page 1 of Technology, December 1 Massachuset's Institute of Technology. In a heading and short item in the Digger column, page 2, December 2, we referred to \"ordinance\" when we meant \"ordnance\" (specifically, unexploded bombs).

In an article headlined Rural buildings face ruin or twee renovations (page 11, November 16) 400,000 hectares was wrongly converted as 1,000 acres.
