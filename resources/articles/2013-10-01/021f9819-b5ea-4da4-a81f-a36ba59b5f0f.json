When I couldn't stomach seeing yet another woman's body on the slab, I decided to swerve the first series of Ripper Street (BBC1), as its name and setting promised, to me, another period thriller that played to our fascination with the gruesome Jack. Yet I was in a minority \u2013 it picked up steam as the series progressed, with an average of 7.1 million viewers tuning in every week, making a second run inevitable. And here it is. I had imagined something akin to The Crimson Petal and the White, only more straight; instead, it turns out to be a cartoonish Dickensian romp, with its three amigo law-enforcement leads frolicking in the muck and mire of east London, 1890. Matthew Macfadyen returns as Detective Inspector Reid, a serious-minded, watery-eyed copper who insists on paperwork, efficiency and being on the right side of a wobbly moral line. He is joined in the good fight by fellow plod Bennet, played by Jerome Flynn, who we last saw embroiled in corruption and slaughter in Game of Thrones, and Captain Jackson, an American surgeon who seems to have wandered across from the set of CSI: Muttonchops. All three men have love interests, but these subplots feel flat compared with their interactions with each other. This is a bromance so epic it makes Watson and Sherlock's relationship seem frosty. Ripper Street often plays out as if it's been assembled from discarded Sherlock scripts, in fact. The frenzied plot in this opener is a precarious tower of double-crossings and missteps. A police officer finds himself thrown out of the window of an opium den and impaled on a railing; he's from the rival Limehouse division, and there is some confusion as to what he was doing there in the first place. Reid's dogged investigations reveal that he is actually part of a huge heroin-smuggling operation \u2013 heroin is, at this stage, all shiny, mysterious and new \u2013 fronted by Blush Pang (really), a woman brought over to London from Hong Kong against the will of her brother. Her brother spends much of the episode punching or stabbing people to avenge the family's honour, and while Blush Pang turns out to be a wrong 'un in the end, we're left with a new villain for the series, in the form of bent police chief Jedediah Shine, the man at the heart of it all. In one last twist, Shine might have an unlikely nemesis in the Elephant Man Joseph Merrick, who saw Shine bumping off his protege. It's certainly pacy. Its profound silliness means it is best to approach Ripper Street as a graphic novel; it has the same cartoonish, over-the-top approach to violence and gore as Luther, for example. Jackson pieces together crimes with a combination of primitive forensics and gung-ho experimentation. He identifies this new drug \"heroin\" by having a go himself: there is a subsequent dream sequence involving billowing white sheets. Apparently, just one dose is enough to cause his face to transform into that of a lifelong addict, all red eyes, sunken cheeks and hollow stare. I find it hard to believe that there isn't a knowing raised eyebrow behind much of the dialogue. The characters speak in a hilarious mishmash of Dickens mimicry and anachronisms. While Bennet might say: \"He was frighted, and earnest in that fright,\" Jackson will talk of Blush Pang's \"low self-esteem\". There are panto lines to usher on the story \u2013 \"Evidence collected there brings us here\" stood out, as did \"He's got something here in his spinal column.\" A surgeon admonishes the detectives for smoking in the operating theatre. It doesn't so much stretch belief as etherise it, lay it out on a slab and start jabbing a rusty saw into its leg. But that's all part of the fun. Ripper Street could have been a horrible show. Its rapid cuts are nauseating, and the incessant soundtrack clobbers viewers around the ears for the full hour, never letting up. But there is something irresistible about its gumption and swagger. And there was a brothel, and a brothel-keeper, but she wasn't dead. So that's progress.
