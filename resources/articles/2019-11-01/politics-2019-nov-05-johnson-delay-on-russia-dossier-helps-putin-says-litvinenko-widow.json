Marina Litvinenko said the prime minister was in danger of making the same \u201cmistake\u201d as Theresa May, who as home secretary refused to hold a public inquiry into her husband\u2019s murder in 2006 by polonium poisoning in central London. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. We saw the same thing in my husband\u2019s case,\u201d she said, as the deadline passed for clearing the keenly awaited intelligence and security committee (ISC) report on Russia for publication before the general election. Two Kremlin assassins poisoned Alexander Litvinenko, who was an FSB officer turned dissident, with a radioactive cup of tea. It took almost a decade before a public inquiry concluded the Russian state was responsible, in an operation \u201cprobably approved\u201d by Vladimir Putin personally. Litvinenko said on Tuesday: \u201cPutin\u2019s goal is to create chaos and instability. He wants to interfere in elections in the US and Europe. The report makes recommendations to protect our system. By delaying, it looks like we are playing the same game. Putin can say we\u2019re no different.\u201d She said May\u2019s refusal to publicise the facts surroundings her husband\u2019s state-sponsored killing emboldened Moscow. Last year, Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with novichok in Salisbury \u2013 a plot May blamed on Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. \u201cWe have another crime,\u201d Litvinenko pointed out. The ISC report had been due to be published early this week and was awaiting its final clearance from Downing Street to check it contained no classified national security material. But on Monday No 10 refused to give its approval before parliament dissolved on Tuesday, prompting the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, to ask: \u201cWhat have you got to hide?\u201d The ISC chairman, Dominic Grieve, warned that the critical dossier may not appear until six months after the December election. The dossier, the product of 18 months\u2019 work which was supported by research from Britain\u2019s spy agencies and third-party experts, examines the threat posed by Russia to the UK, including its subversion and penetration of political institutions, plus Russian killings on British soil and the danger to British allies. Ministers have struggled to justify the withholding of the report, with Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, saying only that the report \u201cwould be published in due course\u201d and seeking instead to criticise Labour. During an emergency Commons debate on Tuesday on the failure to release the report, Thornberry said the decision invited suspicion: \u201cThey realise that this report will lead to other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign.\u201d Thornberry said that during three \u201cmysterious\u201d years in Russia, Johnson\u2019s key aide, Dominic Cummings, had \u201callegedly forged\u201d relationships with prominent Russians, including Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin\u2019s chief ideologist, whom she described as \u201cthe power behind Vladimir Putin\u2019s throne\u201d. Surkov, currently serving as Putin\u2019s personal adviser, is credited with inventing the term \u201csovereign democracy\u201d to describe Russia\u2019s authoritarian system. The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014 after Russia\u2019s invasion and occupation of Crimea. During the 1990s, Surkov worked for the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Thornberry also cited the \u201cdubious activities\u201d of the Conservative Friends of Russia, a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group run out of the Russian embassy by Sergey Nalobin, an alleged foreign intelligence spy, who spent five years cultivating relationships with senior Conservatives. In response, Christopher Pincher, a Foreign Office minister, accused Thornberry of engaging in a \u201crundown of interesting smears and conspiracy theories\u201d and said it was \u201crather rich for her to suggest that the Conservative party and this government is somehow linked to Russian disinformation, given the way her own party leadership has acted\u201d. Grieve warned MPs the dossier would now not be published until the committee reformed under the new government \u201cand, in 2017, that took six months\u201d. In a later statement, he said he was \u201cextremely disappointed and baffled as to why the government has not given a reason why the report cannot be published\u201d. \u201cThis has been a standard process, right up until the point that the prime minister \u2013 against the advice of the agencies themselves \u2013 stopped us from publishing. This must not be allowed to happen again,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cWe cannot have a situation in which a committee of parliament is not able to share its findings with parliament and the wider public. I expect our successors on the committee will rewrite the procedures to ensure this does not occur in future.\u201d Downing Street was left isolated in the Commons, with the vast majority of MPs on both sides calling for the document to be published. Keith Simpson, a Conservative ISC member, said: \u201cThis report has been cleared by the intelligence and security agencies\u201d and \u201ccivil servants and officials saw no reason why this should not be published\u201d. The 50-page dossier was submitted to Downing Street on 17 October for Johnson\u2019s approval and the committee\u2019s expectation was that it would receive political clearance last week so it could be published on Monday. When pressed by MPs, Pincher would not say whether Johnson had read the report, but insisted that it often took longer than 10 days for final political sign off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
