To orchestrate the scale of his subterfuge and to lie consistently at such an elite level for more than a decade \u2013 live at press conferences, on TV, in books, even in court \u2013 was a performance worthy of a champion. Of a champion liar. But lying was just part of the artillery Armstrong deployed to keep the deception in place and to deny that he used performance-enhancing drugs in the course of cheating his way to seven Tour de France victories. The deception was outlined in meticulous and shocking detail over hundreds of pages in the United States Anti-Doping Agency's (Usada) report released last week. Based on dozens of interviews, including with ex-team mates, the report accuses Armstrong and his handlers of being \"engaged in a massive and long-running scheme to use drugs, cover their tracks, intimidate witnesses, tarnish reputations, lie to hearing panels and the press and do whatever was necessary to conceal the truth\". Armstrong didn't just take drugs: he was the enforcer of a small mafia within professional cycling that moved ruthlessly against anyone who threatened to expose him or his collaborators. He bullied and threatened team-mates, journalists and fellow cycling professionals and officials. Just ask Emma O'Reilly, a masseuse on the US Postal Service team when Armstrong was leader. She had a front-row seat and saw how he and the team operated. She used make-up to cover-up Armstrong's syringe bruises. She helped ferry drug packages and delivered them in person to Armstrong. At one point, he turned to her and said: \"Now, Emma, you know enough to bring me down.\" A few years later, O'Reilly contributed to a book in which she recounted what she had seen. Armstrong's legal team went into overdrive. They brought her to court. Armstrong publicly called her \"an alcoholic and a prostitute\". They silenced her. As she said: \"Lance tried to make my life a living hell. There was intimidation, bullying and stress.\" The most shocking aspect of the Usada report may not be what it tells us about \"the most sophisticated doping programme sport has ever seen\", but what it tells us about the vindictive, mendacious, vicious character at the heart of this fraud. Armstrong didn't just attack mountains with vigour, he attacked anyone who threatened to expose the truth of his doping. He comes across less like a cyclist, more like a psychopath. And this may not be the end of the story for Armstrong. The US attorney's office \u2013 which dropped an investigation into his alleged doping earlier this year \u2013 will very likely take an interest in the Usada report, particularly where it alleges that Armstrong perjured himself in the course of making seven sworn legal statements to a Dallas court in 2005. Armstrong, like most bullies, is also a coward. Which is why he has chosen not to contest any of the evidence piled high and mighty in the Usada report. If the US attorney's office comes calling, that will not be an option open to him. But there are also questions for others. Not least for cycling's world governing body, the UCI. Under their watch, Armstrong and his cohorts corrupted and defiled the sport that they were supposedly overseeing. Except that they weren't. Their oversight was abject, abysmal, appalling. In 2005, when the L'\u00c9quipe newspaper leaked the details of Armstrong's 1999 positive drug test, the UCI conducted an \"investigation\" in which Armstrong was cleared. Dick Pound, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said the UCI report was \"so lacking in professionalism and objectivity that it borders on farcical\". Why was the UCI so useless? As one cycling journalist observed last week, the governing body \"consistently, either through naivety, incompetence or complicity, concealed the worst excesses of a decade of doping\". Which was it \u2013 naivety, incompetence or complicity? This is the same body that accepted $125,000 from Armstrong to help fund the UCI's anti-doping research. How he must have laughed. You couldn't make it up. Only Armstrong did \u2013 and the UCI bought it every time. They have no excuse. Journalists such as the Sunday Times duo David Walsh and Paul Kimmage were tenacious in their pursuit of Armstrong over a 13-year period, yet the UCI paid no notice. And there are questions too for Nike. The world's largest sportswear brand have pledged to continue their commercial deals with the disgraced doper \u2013 they sell close to 100 items of Armstrong-related clothing. Why would the world's leading sportswear brand want to continue to be associated with a man who was at the centre of one of sport's biggest frauds? Just do it, the Nike slogan says. Do what? Should aspirant young sports enthusiast take Armstrong's lead? Lie, bully, dope and cheat your way to the top? In a 2001 ad for Nike, Lance Armstrong said: \"This is my body and I can do whatever I want to it\u2026 Everybody wants to know what I am on. What am I on? I'm on my bike busting my ass six hours a day. What are you on?\" That is a question that anyone associated with this debacle \u2013 the UCI, the journalists who failed to report properly what was happening, Nike \u2013 should now ask themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
