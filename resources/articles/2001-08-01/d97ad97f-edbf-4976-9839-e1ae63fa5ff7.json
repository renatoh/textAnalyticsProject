More than one in 10 firms plan to leave setting up schemes to the last minute, risking a fine of up to \u00a350,000 for failing to introduce a scheme in time, according to pensions to life insurer Virgin Direct. \"With just eight weeks to go the clock is very much ticking now for employers and our research shows there is a hardcore who intend to leave it all to the last minute, particularly in the small business sector. \"Unfortunately they may well find it difficult to actually get a scheme set up in time and could get clobbered with a hefty fine as a result,\" according to Virgin Direct's marketing director, Gordon Maw. All companies employing five or more staff have to set up a stakeholder pension scheme by October 8, with Virgin calculating that more than 50,000 are planning to leave it to the last minute. According to the Virgin research, two thirds of companies have yet to consult their employees about the schemes they plan to offer.\"Employers need to remember they are legally required to consult staff on choosing a pension scheme before actually picking their pension provider,\" said Mr Maw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
