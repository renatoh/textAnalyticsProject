The Turkish government made the claims ahead of what may prove to be a bruising meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and major European powers in Downing Street on Tuesday afternoon. Turkey claimed it had full veto rights for any proposal within Nato. \u201cIf our friends at Nato do not recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations ... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said before travelling to London. \u201cNato is an institution where Turkey has full veto rights, politically and militarily, and there are procedures here,\u201d Turkish government officials said. \u201cThere is no such thing as Turkey blackmailing \u2013 a statement like that is unacceptable.\u201d Erdo\u011fan has blocked a defence plan for Poland and the Baltic states until Nato recognises that the Syrian Kurdish YPG are a terrorist threat that must be addressed. Ahead of his departure from Ankara, Erdo\u011fan reiterated the Turkish position, telling reporters: \u201cIf our friends at Nato do not recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations ... we will stand against any step that will be taken there.\u201d At the four-way meeting with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, Erdo\u011fan will demand Europe endorses his plan for a \u201csafe zone\u201d and will also seek a EU donation for the reconstruction of northern Syria. He will also complain that Nato allies have left Turkey alone in its fight against terror, particularly against the YPG. The meeting is a precursor to a wider Nato leaders meeting on Wednesday that could see divisions exposed across a wider front. Macron is angry both at the Turkish decision to invade Syria, and the manner in which the decision was taken in consultation with only one Nato ally, the US. Macron warned it will create a humanitarian disaster, undermine the YPG\u2019s leading role in suppressing Isis and complicate efforts to secure a peace settlement across Syria. Britain and Germany are both critical of Turkish actions, but believe it would be a major strategic blunder if the criticism caused Turkey to desert Nato, and instead move to further cement its fledgling alliance with Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump, who endorsed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s decision to invade northern Syria on 6 October, is not due to attend the Downing Street meeting. On Monday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper urged Turkey to stop holding up support for the military plan. Esper warned Ankara that \u201cnot everybody sees the threats that they see\u201d and added he would not support labelling the YPG as terrorists to break the impasse. \u201cThe message to Turkey ... is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can\u2019t be held up by their own particular concerns,\u201d he said as he flew to London. \u201cAlliance unity, alliance readiness, means that you focus on the bigger issues \u2013 the bigger issue being the readiness of the [Nato] alliance. And not everybody\u2019s willing to sign up to their agenda. Not everybody sees the threats that they see.\u201d Trump has a separate dispute with Erdo\u011fan over Turkey\u2019s decision to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system. Trump has warned it may make it impossible for the US to supply F-35 stealth fighters since the Russian provision of air defences to Turkey may enable Russia to learn about the F-35 operational methods. Turkey says it can keep the S-400 technically apart from the Nato systems, and can limit its radar range. Erdo\u011fan has defied US warnings by activating the system and then saying only technicalities were holding back further orders from Moscow. Turkey says its incursion into north-east Syria is designed to set up a safe zone that weakens the YPG, a faction that it claims is umbilically linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party that it has been fighting for decades. Trump\u2019s decision to give Erdo\u011fan the green light has been seen by the US military and Republican senators alike as a policy disaster that has weakened the US\u2019s reputation for standing alongside allies such as the Syrian Kurds. In a fresh sign of the chaos being caused by the invasion, nine civilians \u2013 most of them children \u2013 lost their lives, and 10 others were wounded on Monday in an attack by Turkish artillery against the town of Tel Rifaat, south of the Turkish border. As many as 230,000 people were displaced by the initial Turkish invasion, but many have now returned to their homes. Turkey plans to establish a 20-mile-deep safe zone along a 75-mile stretch of the border, while on the east and west of the safe zone Turkish and Russian forces will conduct joint patrols. Turkey is holding back from expanding its safe zone partly due to agreements struck with Russia and the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
