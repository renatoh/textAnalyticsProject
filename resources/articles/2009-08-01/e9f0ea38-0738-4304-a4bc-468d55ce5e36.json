Clarissa Farr, head of St Paul's girls' school in west London, said A-levels were still a passport to university for her students, but the cleverest needed more of a challenge from the exam papers. The school, where fees are up to \u00a35,055 a term and whose alumni include Harriet Harman, the deputy leader of the Labour party, topped the Guardian's league table of private schools, published today. The school's record number of A grades saw 90 of the 108 students who sat A-levels this year achieving straight As; 58 gained a place at Oxford or Cambridge. Next year an A* is being introduced at A-level for students who achieve 90%. Half of the A grade students would have achieved this, Farr said. The table was compiled by the Independent Schools Council (ISC) for 466 private schools. Girls' schools occupied the top three places, and seven of the top 10. The brother school of St Paul's girls' school and Eton were two of at least 60 schools that boycotted the ranking. The Perse school for girls, in Cambridge, also withheld its results. Tricia Kelleher, its principal, called league tables \"a flawed beauty parade\", which offer only a crude measurement of success. \"[They] in no way capture the school's ethos, which is all about intellectual, emotional and social growth,\" she said. The data shows over half \u2013 52.3% \u2013 of A-levels sat by students at private schools scored an A, a rise of 1.6 points on last year. Across private and state schools, some 26.7% of A-levels taken this year scored an A \u2013 the 27th year running that the proportion of students achieving the top grade has risen. Growing numbers of private schools are opting for the international baccalaureate as an alternative to A-levels, but Farr said St Paul's was sticking with A-levels. \"They are flexible enough for students to be in plays in their penultimate year, take part in sport and do non-examined work,\" she said. \"The IB is too rigid and heavily scheduled.\" She said that while she welcomed the A* grade, it would not necessarily provide more of a challenge for the brightest students because it was not accompanied by harder exam papers. \"I think there should be more extended questions and more stretching and open-ended questions,\" she said. Farr said her school was conducting a review into whether GCSEs provided enough of a challenge for pupils and would consider adopting the international GCSE, which is similar to the old O-level, for some subjects. This year's national A-level results showed a widening of the gap between private and state schools. While more than half of grades at private schools were As, at grammars it was just under 40% and at comprehensives just over 20%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
