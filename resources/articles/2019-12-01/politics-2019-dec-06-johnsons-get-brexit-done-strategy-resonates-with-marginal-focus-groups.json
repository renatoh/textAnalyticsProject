In Rainham in Essex, a group of leave voters, some of whom had voted Labour in the past, spoke warmly about the prime minister. And if his endlessly repeated mantra was familiar, warnings about his character appeared to have made less of an impact. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything he says, but he cheers me up,\u201d said Sarah (participants agreed to be referred to by their first names). \u201cHe\u2019s like a puppy: you can\u2019t kick a puppy,\u201d said Norman . \u201cHe reminds me of a bog brush: I like him!\u201d said Lisa. Labour strategists are particularly concerned about the party\u2019s appeal among its traditional supporters in Brexit-voting areas, who may be susceptible to Johnson\u2019s signature pledge. There was a sense among the leave group that the prime minister was capable of getting things done \u2013 an alluring characteristic to voters deeply frustrated by three and a half years of Brexit stasis. \u201cYou don\u2019t want someone indecisive,\u201d said Michael. Asked to describe the Tories in one word or phrase, he said they were \u201cbullish\u201d. Asked what he meant by that, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s good but it\u2019s also bad. They\u2019re just ruthless.\u201d The Essex seat of Dagenham and Rainham is held by Labour\u2019s Jon Cruddas, with a majority of 4,652. Asked to identify the most pressing issues in the constituency, each group \u2013 leavers and remainers \u2013 came up with very similar lists: health service cuts, crime and affordable housing all featured prominently. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the likes of us,\u201d said Lisa, a leave voter, referring to a housing development going up nearby on land that used to be part of Ford\u2019s vast Dagenham plant. Rather than blaming Boris Johnson and the Tory governments that preceded his, several of the Brexiters pointed the finger at Cruddas for failing to secure improvements for his constituents. Cruddas held the seat in 2017 with a majority of less than 5,000; but the perception was that he doesn\u2019t have to fight hard for it. \u201cEvery election time he\u2019s probably sitting back in his seat, having a spa, thinking: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got this in the bag,\u2019\u201d said Michael, to general laughter. The leavers also raised questions about the slew of giveaways in Labour\u2019s manifesto, from free broadband to restoring the pensions of Waspi women. \u201cWhere is all this money, this funding, these people coming from?\u201d said Elaine. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep taxing working people.\u201d Asked to come up with a single word or phrase that represents each of the two main parties, Labour was \u201cbroken promises\u201d or \u201ceverything promised\u201d. There was a palpable nostalgia for the leaders of the past, who appeared more decisive. \u201cThatcher would have got you out, straight away,\u201d said Lisa. Dave, a lifelong Labour voter, agreed. \u201cWhile I didn\u2019t respect her politics, I had a lot of respect for her as a woman,\u201d he said. At the end of the conversation, two of the group said they had voted Labour in the past, but were expecting to cast their vote next week for \u201cBoris\u201d. The second focus group, composed of voters who supported remain in 2016, was more solidly Labour \u2013 the Lib Dems were barely mentioned, and several of Labour\u2019s most eye-catching manifesto pledges had hit home, including free broadband. Matt said deciding how to vote this time had been tricky. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Corbyn is the right guy to lead the country; but I do think he\u2019s a damn sight better than any of the alternatives. It\u2019s the best of a bad lot, really,\u201d he said. David agreed. \u201cI\u2019m Labour, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s the right man or the job. He doesn\u2019t feel strong enough for me. He doesn\u2019t give off a leadership kind of feeling.\u201d And among this group, Johnson was deeply unpopular \u2013 described as sneaky, and some of the things he says \u201creally cringey\u201d. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t care,\u201d said David, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s prime minister: I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trustworthy; I don\u2019t think he\u2019s qualified for the job.\u201d Focus groups are small scale and can only provide qualitative insights; but they can help to shed light on the reasoning behind voters\u2019 decisions, and are used by all main parties \u2013 including Labour. Asked about where each of the leaders would go on holiday, for Jeremy Corbyn, the answer was a coach trip to Bournemouth; for the Brexit party\u2019s Nigel Farage, the Cayman Islands; and for Boris Johnson, it was Las Vegas. \u201cYou\u2019ll find him where he shouldn\u2019t be, where he\u2019s not meant to be,\u201d said Michael."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
