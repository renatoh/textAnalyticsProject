Less than five months ago a Welsh-dominated Lions team were trouncing the Wallabies in Sydney and Quade Cooper was stuck on the outer. Now, suddenly, the 2015 Rugby World Cup cannot come quickly enough for Australia and \"Super Cooper\" is leaving vapour trails across European skies, a seriously worrying development for Wales and England alike. This may have been a positive autumn for those who relish full-throttle rugby but Saturday's outcome, the ninth in succession for Australia in this fixture, had implications beyond denting Welsh self-belief. By 2015 the revitalised Wallabies will be even more dangerous, with Kurtley Beale and David Pocock back to support Cooper and the equally electric Israel Folau. Given the presence of England and Wales in the same pool, the odds on a premature exit for one home nation are tumbling fast. If Wales still felt confident enough to talk about becoming the first team to win a hat-trick of Six Nations titles, this autumn has once again made that a relative target. Australia, with four wins in their last four Tests, are unrecognisable from the divided mob of the Robbie Deans era, the public sanctions handed out by the head coach, Ewen McKenzie, following a late-night Dublin drinking session having cleared some heads. If this is what a few pints encourages, England and Wales will want to know exactly what they were drinking. In Cooper and Folau, in particular, the Wallabies have the kind of attacking threats Warren Gatland and Stuart Lancaster can only drool over. If anyone needs a winter warmer in the coming weeks, check out Cooper's brace of \"cat-flap\" passes to Joe Tomane in the first half, offloads good enough to impress even the watching Barry John. In terms of expansive creative genius, the contrast between Cooper and some of England's recent midfield efforts is like comparing the Nullarbor Plain with Clapham Common. Wales also have plenty to ponder, having yet again endured what Dan Lydiate bluntly described as \"a kick in the nuts\". If more is learnt from defeats than victories, Sam Warburton's side now have a post-graduate degree in antipodean psychology but the evidence strongly suggests they are less effective if their best XV are not all available. Without Jamie Roberts to barrel them over the gain-line and Adam Jones to sap the strength of opposition scrummagers they are vulnerable to sides who soak up their physicality and punish them out wide. The performance of Michael Hooper, who had the better of Warburton at openside, will also revive the debate about Wales's ideal back-row balance. Not that the injured Jones would have thrived during Saturday's first half which contained not a single scrum. Australia are always liable to thrive in a rugby league-style contest and could easily have scored more than three eye-catching tries finished by the excellent Christian Leali'ifano, Folau and Tomane. Gatland felt Folau's pass to the latter had drifted forward despite the refereeing directives on momentum passes \u2013 not a problem if the ball heads backwards initially from the passer's hands \u2013 and aimed a sly swipe at the English official, Wayne Barnes: \"I doubt he would have made that decision himself if it was the All Blacks playing.\" A stream of breakdown penalties also denied Wales the rhythm which stretches sides less fit than they are. George North made an impression as a makeshift centre, a position he may fill permanently one day, and collected two tries but he concedes Wales are still collectively falling short. \"We've shown we are competing well but we haven't got that little edge yet. When we have them on the ropes and know we are on top physically we have to push on.\" His team-mate Scott Williams reckons another Six Nations title is perfectly possible and that Wales will eventually get over their autumn hump. \"It's just accuracy and composure and making fewer errors. It's a fine margin but it's the difference between winning and losing.\" The uncomfortable fact remains that Wales have not beaten a big three southern hemisphere side under Gatland for five years. There will be further chances \u2013 Australia are due back in Europe next year for another busy tour as they seek to bolster their union's financial position \u2013 but, as Lydiate acknowledged, it is difficult to cope with opponents as good as Cooper, now a 50-cap Wallaby. \"It is so hard to defend against him because you don't know if he is going to pass. When you think he will take it into contact he pulls the pass out of the back of the hand.\" The wizards of Oz are casting spells again and the Lions tour feels like ancient history.
