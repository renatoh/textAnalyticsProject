We have a real opportunity for cross-party consensus here that could deliver enormous benefits to state and society. With reoffending rates for those on short-term sentences topping 70% and the costs adding up to more than \u00a310bn a year, there is no excuse for the kind of backward thinking that Jack Straw recently expressed. The criminal justice hustings in two weeks' time will be an important test for Labour. Will the other leadership candidates embrace a progressive approach to criminal justice as well or will they be too hidebound by the misguided dogma of New Labour?
