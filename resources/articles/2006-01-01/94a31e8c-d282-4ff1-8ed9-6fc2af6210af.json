Being forced to feign interest in photos of people you don't know. Watching former Baywatch star Traci Bingham sleep when you're not in bed with her. The assorted \"witticisms\" one hears when the Guardian's new talking elevator announces it's \"going down\". Listening to Arsene Wenger and Sam Allardyce moaning about the African Nations Cup. A Garth Crooks question. All these things are spirit-crushingly tedious, but not so dull that they can hold a candle to anything to do with Middlesbore Football Club. So it's a measure of how very little happened on Planet Football today that the most exciting story to feature on the bright yellow Sky Sports News look-here-this-is-important ticker concerned an injury to one charismatic Bore defender that's caused the collapse of another charismatic Bore defender's move to West Bromwich Albion. Gripping, eh? Yes, in a global non-exclusive, the Fiver can parrot the non-exclusive that a suspected stress-fracture to Gareth Southgate's ankle has ruled the 33-year-old out until April. Which means Middlesbore are no longer prepared to sell Ugo Ehiogu, what with George Boateng and Franck Queudrue also being as out of commission as a Celebrity Big Brother contestant's sense of dignity. Not that the aforementioned Mr Ehiogu's happy, mind. \"Ugo has passed his medical and agreed everything,\" droned his Mr 15%, Steve Kutner, earlier today, as some paint dried on a nearby blade of grass. \"He does not want to go back to Middlesbore, despite what might have happened. In his head he's already a West Brom player.\" Which means that, in his head, Ugo's already a defender with an unfashionable club from one of the bleakest parts of England, who are relegation certainties with disaffected fans and an uninspiring manager. That journey back to the Riverside shouldn't prove too much of a wrench. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I look up to Joe Cole\" - in revealing his role model, Pope's O'Rangers youngster Chris Burke fits neatly into the Glasgow stereotype. Not that he's ever pitched up at one of the city's cab firms in the early hours, bruised, bare-chested, battered, barefoot, broke and bloodstained after suffering a beating at the hands of a 'love rival'. ********************* THAT FIVER CREATIVE MEETING IN FULL (AKA THE THINLY-DISGUISED RETURN OF 'THIS IS HOW WE WORK') 4.31pm: Time's a wasting. Chase rag-tag degenerates into jazzy new meeting room for 'quick chat' about 'new Fiver material'. Force all to sit on Swiss balls and feel burst of pride at new, proactive approach to preview piece on Blackburn v MU Rowdies in Tinpot Vase semi-final. 4.36pm: Present colleagues with subject matter and choice of Morten Gamst Pedersen quotes: \"Last season there were people who said all we did was tackle\" and \"we are playing really well now... there are times when we can play beach football almost.\" 4.38pm: Scribble \"Blackeye Rovers???\" on flip-chart in brightly-coloured marker pen. 4.38pm+ 34s: Flip chart falls over. 4.39pm: Pick up flip-chart. Write 'Life's a beach!!!'. Feel trickle of sweat down back of thigh. Regret leaving Bombay Sapphire miniature in desk drawer. Regret attempting to breathe life into long-dead This Is How We Work Fiver format. Still, too late now. 4.44pm: Clear throat. Rustle through morning's papers for effect, read turgid agency quotes aloud: \"Ferguson has strengthened defence... Patrice Evra set to make debut ... United to rest Rooney, Van Nistelrooy and Ferdinand.\" 4.48pm: Continue to endure stony silence. Feel lump well up in throat; also emptiness, self-loathing etc. Start singing Morrissey's 'The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get'. 4.50pm: Tail off. Mutter \"MU Rowdies?\" in cracked voice. Begin to draw caricature of Fergie complete with speech bubble emerging from his mouth containing the sentence: \"Blackburn are a hard team to play against.\" 4.55pm: Watch colleagues leave in silence. 4.57pm: Take a seat, bury face in folded arms and break down sobbing. 4.59pm: Smash coccyx as Swiss Ball gives way underneath us and sends us crashing to floor. Between howls, advise any Fiver readers who've made it this far to follow Blackeye Rovers v MU Rowdies as it happens, here from 7.30pm. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Lyon will not be selling striker Olivier Thomert to a club on the brink of its fourth opening-round cup exit this season. Everton will spend their GBP7.5m elsewhere. Lord Ferg is currently mulling over bringing Real Madrid's Thomas Gravesen or Roma midfielder Olivier Dacourt to the Rowdies. Hmm ... tough one. Upset at his lack of first-team action, Bolton striker Jared Borgetti has instructed his Mr 15% to sound out Benfica. And Espanyol will end Walter Pandiani's forgettable stay at Bongo FC with a \u00a31m offer, it says here. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF In a shameless U-turn Steven Gerrard would be proud of, Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano has apologised to the club after telling reporters he wanted to leave. \"I am unhappy at present because I am not scoring goals and I blame this for my stupid outburst,\" sniffed the Brazilian. Cardiff chairman Sam Hammam has rejected Sheffield United's GBP2m bid for England U21 striker Cameron Jerome - because the Blades are a little club. \"They don't have the stature to sign a player of Jerome's calibre,\" he deadpanned, lobbing a metaphorical grenade Neil Warnock's way. Brondby defender Daniel Agger has arrived on Merseyside to finalise personal terms on a GBP5.8m move to Liverpool. And Burton Albion \"hero\" Saul Deeney has been told to sign a new contract with the club or miss their FA Cup replay at the DevilBowl. \"I actually think he got more credit than he deserved on Sunday,\" moaned put-out boss Nigel Clough. \"Saul is going to Ireland for a couple of days and we'll have a serious talk when he gets back.\" * * * * * * * * * * WIN A SWANKY SAMSUNG D600 PHONE Send your best sporting picture - a close-up celebration shot, Freddie Flintoff smoking breakfast, two Page 3 girls fighting over Peter Crouch ... whatever - taken with your mobile to the.gallery@observer.co.uk now.

It would be have been a more newsworthy story had it read 'Joe Cole defended'\" - Tim Neale. \"Re: today's Sun front page. Good to see Chelsea have finally lost their unbeaten record now Joe Cole has had a kicking\" - James Haydock. \"So Hernan Crespo wants to leave London because he's missing TV, theatre and the cinema. As a fellow Londoner, I share his pain. Why can't we have these social outlets? I also miss art galleries, big red buses and drunk teenage girls hanging around outside tacky nightclubs in the West End\" - Jonathan Wood. \"Yesterday's Fiver revealed that Stan Staunton has played in three World Cup finals, which came as news to me, as I thought he'd merely participated in the World Cup finals three times. Is this part of an ongoing media conspiracy to keep the achievements of former Liverpool players under wraps?\" - Alan Synnott. \"Re: yesterday's tardiness. That bloke who admitted to keeping a log of Fiver arrival times since the dawn of man must be going up the walls. Yesterday's post-6pm delivery probably had him running naked down his local high street while wailing something about the devastating effect on his 2006 average\" - Smiley. \"Call me stupid, but all this time I thought this was called the Fiver because it only takes five minutes to read\" - Ryan Harding. \"Last night's League Cup semi-final was the first time a substitute has scored on their debut while simultaneously paying homage to two members of the Village People. Head on, with that moustache, he looked like the NY Cop. Side on, the stripe was obviously influenced by the Red Indian's head-dress\" - John Hindle. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
