The six-wicket win represented a first Nottinghamshire defeat in a Friends Life t20 group game at Trent Bridge in two years and sealed the visitors' appearance in the quarter-finals on 24 or 25 July. Three more points from the remaining two matches would guarantee Yorkshire a home tie in the last eight. They are among three counties \u2013 Worcestershire and Derbyshire are the other two \u2013 never to have made it to English cricket's 20-over showpiece. Superbly led by Azeem Rafiq, who at 21 recently became the youngest captain in the club's 149-year history, Yorkshire book-ended this success with eye-catching moments. Joe Root's occasional off-spin claimed a wicket with the first ball of the contest and Gary Ballance sealed the victory with 14 deliveries to spare when he struck consecutive straight sixes off the left-arm spinner Graeme White. There was plenty of good stuff in between too, as their canny bowling and tigerish fielding restricted Nottinghamshire to a total which the captain, Adam Voges, admitted was 20 runs shy of par. Only the Australian, whose 57-ball 70 was terminated in the closing stages by his compatriot Mitchell Starc, truly got going. The left-armer Starc, the competition's most prolific bowler, has now taken 10 of his 16 wickets in the final over of innings. He is a crucial cog in Yorkshire's machine but doubt remains as to whether he will be available for the final in Cardiff on August 25 if this current momentum \u2013 this made it six wins in as many completed matches \u2013 is maintained. Starc will be released by Australia A to play in the quarter-finals but his participation for the club later in the season is yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile further complications have arisen with the club's other overseas recruit David Miller, the South African batsman, who was yesterday named as one of 56 imports signed to Sri Lanka's Twenty20 competition, which runs from August 10-31. \"We will cross that bridge when we come to it,\" Yorkshire's director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, said after the match. Voges was also named by Sri Lanka's tournament organisers but later confirmed his 100% commitment to Nottinghamshire, who need one more point also to progress to the last eight, until the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
