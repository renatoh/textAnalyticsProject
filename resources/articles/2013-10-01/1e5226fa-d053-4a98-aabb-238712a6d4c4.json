English Heritage monitors those judged the most important \u2013 the Grade I and Grade II* listed \u2013 but the challenge of surveying more than 340,000 sites was far beyond its resources. Instead, in several pilot studies, volunteers including students, unemployed and retired people, and workers with a bit of free time and a lot of interest in the built environment, have been recruited and, after a short training course, turned loose with cameras and notebooks. The sites were chosen to give a spread of potential problems, including decaying urban streets and agricultural and industrial areas with many redundant buildings. The preliminary results suggest that 4%, or at least 13,000 sites if the statistics hold true nationally, are in trouble. \"These are really important sites, these aren't the grand stately homes and parks but they are really cherished by people, the heritage on your own street corner,\" English Heritage chief executive, Simon Thurley, said. \"This is a job that we could not have completed in several lifetimes, but the volunteers have been magnificent. I went out myself with the group in north Norfolk, and their energy and enthusiam was amazing \u2013 at the end of the day they were saying 'give us more'.\" David Day, a volunteer on the pilot programme in Whitehaven, Cumbria, said: \"Many of us are concerned about the neglect of local buildings that are crucial features of our town. We are worried that we will literally lose sight of the past, and in so doing we lose the chance to understand the present.\" English Heritage now plans to expand the scheme nationally, but how to resolve the issues it has identified is another problem. The organisation gives grants only for the most important listed buildings, and cash-strapped local authorities are unlikely to be able to help either. However, Thurley hopes that just flagging up the state of the buildings may be enough to encourage many private owners to tackle them. English Heritage's own survey, the annual Heritage at Risk register, shows that 5,700 of the most important Grade I and II* listed buildings, scheduled monuments and archaeological sites, parks, gardens, battlefields, churches and shipwrecks, are in danger. The number is slightly down from 5,831 last year, and English Heritage believes it will meet its target of removing a quarter of the entries that were on the 2010 register by 2015. The sites still at risk include lime kilns in Greater Manchester, built by Samuel Oldknow in the late 18th century, complete with Gothic windowed accommodation for his workers. The kilns have been redundant since 1896, and the site is derelict and partly buried. A villa in Twickenham, built in 1813 among fields and orchards, was not only the country home of JMW Turner, but also it was designed by him. It is remarkably unaltered, despite the encroaching Edwardian streets, but needs major repairs, partly caused by the fact that in the second world war it became a shadow factory, a disguised site producing airmen's uniforms, when the heavy vibrating machinery caused severe damage. The tall sash windows of the orangery at Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, designed by James \"Athenian\" Stuart, a pioneer of the revival of the classical style in the 18th century, have been boarded up since the second world war, when they fell victim to bomb damage. Thurley admitted that there are sites on the Heritage at Risk register that even he gets discouraged about, including Ushaw home farm in Durham, bult in 1852 complete with catttle byres, haylofts and a milking parlour. \"Here we have a wonderful Victorian model farm, which was originally part of a Catholic seminary. The farm has been abandoned since 2002, and though the university has taken over the buildings, understandably they don't have much use for a farm.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
