Next is expected to announce on Thursday that it has been enjoying 'low single-digit sales increases' over the last few weeks, according to Richard Ratner, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce. He added that sales earlier in the summer were also believed to have been very good, although a decision to delay its summer sale until a few weeks later than its rivals might dampen the half-year results. 'It had nothing left to sell,' said Ratner. Nick Hawkins at Merrill Lynch thinks that both the group's high street stores and its Directory catalogue business should have increased sales by about 12 per cent in the first half of the year. It is 'in a strong position to regain market share momentum' after a disappointing autumn range caused sales growth to falter at the end of last year. Overall, Hawkins expects Next's pre-tax profits to rise by about \u00a315 million to \u00a3207m. Kingfisher will announce its first interims since it demerged its electrical business as KESA and took full management control of French DIY chain Castorama. It will update shareholders on progress in integrating Castorama with its B&amp;Q chain. Retail analyst Carolyn Black forecasts that the French business, which includes Brico Depot as well as Castorama, will increase profits by 37 per cent as merger synergies begin to be realised. Profits at B&amp;Q are expected to be about a quarter higher. While the group will not give an update on current trading, it may give some indication of how the hot weather affected sales. A trading update from Dixons last week indicated that the impact was not as bad as feared. Its UK stores, including PC World, the Link and Currys as well as Dixons, managed to keep sales at the same level as last year over the past 18 weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
