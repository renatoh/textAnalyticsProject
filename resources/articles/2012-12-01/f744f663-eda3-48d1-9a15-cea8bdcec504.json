Presents will be unwrapped, mystery voices will be revealed and questions will be answered \u2013 such as, \"how dated does the Media Guardian top 100 look already?\" Plus, just to remove any sense of jeopardy from a programme when the questions are mostly incidental to the chaos, we can exclusively reveal that the final result is a tie. You're welcome. Media Talk will be back in 2013. Happy new year!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
