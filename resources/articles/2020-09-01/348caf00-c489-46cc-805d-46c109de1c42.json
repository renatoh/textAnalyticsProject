The Liverpool manager\u2019s standing is so high in both Germany and England at the moment it would be a difficult subject to avoid anyway, but when Chelsea kick off their home campaign against the defending champions on Sunday Havertz will feel his real introduction to English football is properly under way. The 21-year-old admitted he was tired out by his debut exertions against Brighton last week, acknowledging that games in the Premier League can be more physically demanding than those in the Bundesliga, but is aware Klopp\u2019s team come with a guarantee of energetic pressing and a record of making blistering starts to league campaigns. Perhaps that was not quite in evidence in the somewhat uncertain opening victory over newly promoted Leeds last week, but Chelsea have invested heavily over the summer in a bid to join Liverpool and Manchester City at the very top of the table, and as part of that strengthening Havertz is well aware that this early season contest could set the tone for what is to follow. \u201cKlopp is a big manager in every sense,\u201d the former Bayer Leverkusen forward said. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot at Liverpool and you can only say congratulations, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s satisfied yet. From what I know of him I would say he is still hungry, wanting to win more titles.\u201d With Timo Werner also in the Chelsea side, a player who originally seemed destined to join Klopp at Anfield, the German connection will be strong at Stamford Bridge. Certainly Klopp will be familiar with what Havertz and Werner have to offer, just as those two know exactly what Liverpool will be getting with the signing of Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have Timo over here with me,\u201d Havertz explained. \u201cI always wanted to play in England but I didn\u2019t know I would get the move so soon. This is a big step for me, coming to a new country with a different culture at such a young age, but when you have a friend in the team from your own country it is always easier.\u201d Yet for all that, a long-time admirer of Chelsea in general and Frank Lampard in particular did not have to think too long about making a decision to leave Leverkusen. \u201cWhen I knew the Chelsea manager wanted me it had a big impact on my thinking,\u201d Havertz said. \u201cFrank Lampard was exactly the sort of player I wanted to be when I was growing up, I used to watch everything he did and it was the same with Michael Ballack. The pair of them were the reason I always used to watch a lot of Chelsea games, I\u2019ve always loved the club and when they got in touch it really was not a very tough decision for me to make.\u201d Havertz did not seek out Ballack for advice about Chelsea or England, though he is aware that other young German imports have not always found it easy to progress in this country. Leroy San\u00e9 found Bayern Munich impossible to resist after a few years in and out of the Manchester City team, while Serge Gnabry has shone since returning to Germany after struggling for game time at Arsenal and West Brom. If anything Havertz comes with a much bigger reputation, regarded as an already complete player after more than a century of games for Leverkusen and a promising half dozen for the national side, hence the \u00a372m fee. He also speaks excellent English, and despite his tender years has an already developed individuality rare in professional sport. He is a supporter of animal welfare charities, for instance, and is studying the piano as a release from playing football. \u201cI like to do things not everybody else will do,\u201d is the way he puts it. \u201cThere was always a piano in my grandma\u2019s house, and when I started playing it I found it relaxing. \u201cI do believe there are more important things in life than football, but I am still very excited about coming to England to play for Chelsea. It was always my goal to play in the Premier League and I am really happy to be here. I remember a lot of the games Chelsea played against Liverpool in the Champions League over the years, and now I am going to get a taste of that rivalry.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
