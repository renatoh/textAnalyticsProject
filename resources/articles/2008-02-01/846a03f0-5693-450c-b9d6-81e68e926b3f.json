An eye-opening piece in the New York Observer reveals the turmoil caused by the paper's new owner, Sam Zell, in the wake of Jim O'Shea's departure. In a recent visit to the paper from his Chicago base Zell amazed staff by urging them to browse internet porn in the workplace, saying it was \"un-American not to like pussy\". He also accused O'Shea of \"piss[ing] all over the paper\". Zell's \"pep talk\" resulted in some executives taking him at his word and the f-word suddenly became common, partly in jest, while others indulged with undisguised glee. One of my newsroom friends emailed me to say: \"The shit has hit the fan\". Then Zell tried to backtrack a little by sending an email to the staff which stated: \"My goal was to shock you, to shake you out of complacency, and to help you understand that the game has changed, and we have to change with it.\" Within hours three senior executives co-signed an email to editorial staff, which said: \"Last week you may have encountered some colourful uses of the lexicon from Sam Zell that we are not used to hearing at the Times.\" It then \"clarified\" that viewing porn on newsroom computers was prohibited, as was \"profane or hostile language.\" It concluded: \"Sam is a force of a nature; the rest of us are bound by the normal conventions of society.\" As the Observer article notes, Zell's intervention further underlined the newsroom's deep split over who should replace O'Shea. It's seen as a battle between the innovation editor, Russ Stanton, 49, who is credited for transforming latimes.com from a barely functional website into something of a machine, and John Arthur, 60, the managing editor, who has worked his way up the editorial chain over 22 years. Stanton is viewed as integral to the paper's future as someone who appreciates that news isn't really exclusively read on paper any longer, while it is thought that Arthur - though well-liked and highly regarded - lacks the vision needed to transform the operation. The Observer quotes people who passionately support each of the men. But it claims that Stanton is somewhat tainted by being close to the publisher, David Hiller, who is very unpopular among in the editorial department. There is a recognition that change of some kind is necessary but everyone is now wondering if Zell can institute change without ruining the paper's credibility. And will he choose the editor? They may not be using the f-word openly anymore, but privately the expletives among the LA Times staff are not being deleted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
