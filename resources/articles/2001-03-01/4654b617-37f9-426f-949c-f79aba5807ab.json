They've got a chance here to repeat those giant-killing exploits, because while the Arse aren't quite the shower Liverpool were last January, they're hardly the cocks of the south. Look, you know exactly what I mean. The Gunners may well lie second in the Premiership, but their recent form is patchy going on abysmal. They're getting thrashed, they're letting in vital late goals, they're scraping 1-0 wins at home when they should do better - and yes, for my argument to hold any water, I'm totally ignoring the match against West Ham. As they've also got a massive Champions League game coming up at Bayern Munich next week which they can't afford to lose, they could be holding back as well. A dangerous game to play against opponents like Blackburn, who are far from useless - and don't let the presence of Graeme Souness on their bench convince you otherwise. The Prince of Punts: West Ham v Spurs: Last goalscorer, Paolo di Canio - \u00a35 @ 11/2 Whilst hunting with my falcon over the wilds of Southern England the other day, the Prince of Punts had a thought. Wouldn't it be nice if one, that is to say we, the royal we, could bet not only on the first goalscorer in the game, but the last also. \"Would that not be divine?\" I asked my faithful bird. It just smiled at me in that way of his and flew after a vole. So imagine my joy when I arrived at Blue Square to find last goalscorer odds available for the FA Cup quarter-finals this weekend. So without further ado, what am I saying, without even thinking, I whopped a fiver on Paolo Di Canio to fire in the last goal in the Hammers' tie with Spurs. Go, go, you glory-grabbing Italian! Now, where's my dancing bear? Sean Ingle: \u00a35 win double - Tranmere v Liverpool, Liverpool to win @ 4/7; West Ham v Tottenham - draw @ 11/5 I don't know anymore. I really don't. But surely, I say - flicking a furtive and slightly shameful glance at my dwindling balance - these two things are evident: Liverpool should be much too good for Tranmere and West Ham v Spurs will be a dull, dank and low-scoring affair. Ergo, my predictions. Liverpool to win at 4/7 and West Ham and Spurs - two out-of-form teams, who know that defeat will end their season - to be a low-scoring draw. But given my run of luck, don't be surprised if the game ends 1-0 with West Ham missing a last-minute penalty to equalise. Mark Gribbler of the Guardian Unlimited Punters Collective: Tottenham to win at West Ham \u00a35 @ 2/1 The value bet is Tottenham. This is my only selection in a tricky weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
