So they should stop distracting them with work, surely. Up in Scotland (or down in Scotland if you are in the Faroe Islands) Dr Barbara Spruce, a cancer expert, has been appointed to the Scottish Science Advisory Committee to advise Scottish executive ministers on scientific issues of strategic importance. Meanwhile, heading west to Wales (or heading east to Wales if you are in, erm, the Atlantic), Professor Michael Quayle, director of the University of Glamorgan's business school, has been invited to join the Welsh assembly's new business procurement task force. The school of biological sciences at Queen Mary, University of London, has made a batch of appointments: Dr Conrad Mullineaux becomes chair in microbiology; Dr Robin Maytum has been made lecturer in biochemistry/enzymology; Dr Mark van der Giezen becomes lecturer in microbiology. Dr Jonathon Grey becomes lecturer in freshwater biology - and if he can find any fresh water in London, he is to be commended. The University of Cambridge has announced that Professor Patrick Sissons will be the new regius professor of physic, succeeding Professor Sir Keith Peters. His first task will be to correct the glaring typo in the job title. education.moves@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
