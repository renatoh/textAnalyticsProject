It would be fantastic if we can inflict a similar defeat on Blackburn to the one Arsenal suffered, so we keep the momentum building towards the FA Cup final. Even after Everton's win, we're still the form team, and while United have won another title it's important we become the only other Big Four team to win a trophy this season \u2013 and thereby give Guus a good send-off. The players should want to put on a good show for Carlo Ancelotti, or anyone eyeing the job, as well as for the fans. Due a big game Didier Drogba \u2013 We win more games without him than with him these days, apparently, a statistic he needs to put right Paul McGarry, Observer reader With Saturday's results having guaranteed Rovers' top-flight survival, this game looks to hold little interest for away supporters. There are issues at stake, though, which should motivate the players and management to put in a good performance: firstly, however unlikely a draw or away win might be, end-of-season points mean pounds, precious rewards to a club on a tight budget. Secondly, the players also need to prove that they can go to a top four ground and avoid a real beating. Recent four-nil drubbings at Liverpool and Arsenal have been low points in a season full of disappointing performances. Thirdly, there are several players who should be keen to impress Sam Allardyce if they want to avoid being shown the door this summer. Due a big game Tugay \u2013 Let's hope he gets his final away outing in the blue and white halves. A true Rovers' legend retires at the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
