Bloomsbury \u00a37.99 Reading George Saunders is, it's safe to say, like no other literary experience. His satirical short stories are set in a kind of Lewis Carroll version of our world, only far, far darker. In them, all of the worst tendencies in human nature and in consumer society seem to have been expanded to suffocate and anaesthetise people's lives. Take the title story, for instance: in a bizarre, allegorical kingdom, a dictator (whose brain falls out at inconvenient opportunities) rises to power by oppressing a minority, with the connivance of the media (three creatures with loudspeakers who talk out of their backsides). It's surreal, rather moving and deeply angry and while it's premature to put Saunders on a level with the late Kurt Vonnegut, as some people have, he's certainly working to keep the master's spirit alive. Home, by Manju Kapur. Faber \u00a37.99 The Indian clan of Home is oddly reminiscent of the families in soaps such as EastEnders - forced to live together in cramped conditions, their lives revolving around keeping the family business going. But unlike their British counterparts, the women of Karol Bagh cannot pass their baby to a relative and take off for Marbella: they know that their role is to serve and extend the family. For mother Sona and daughter Nisha, however, this proves a difficult mission to fulfil - Nisha, for example, is abused by her young cousin at an early age (in a rather sudden change of tone for what had previously been a rather gentle book), but cannot breathe a word. Manju Kapur's novel is tender and well-crafted and boasts a wonderful sense of time and place. Canvey Island, by James Runcie. Bloomsbury \u00a37.99 Martin Turner spends his life torn between the past and present: his past on Canvey Island in Essex, where his mother died in the great postwar floods, and where his family still lives, and his present as a paid-up, Cambridge-educated member of the middle classes. Appropriately given that youthful tragedy, Martin is a water engineer, engaged in a Quixotic struggle to hold back the forces of nature. He also, as this book develops, struggles to hold back his desire for his working-class ex-girlfriend, a symbol of the earthy, ribald, bordering-on-racist, yet irresistibly vital life he left behind on Canvey. This is an accomplished, restrained novel of class and personal conflict, with some great lines and a lovely eye for period detail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
