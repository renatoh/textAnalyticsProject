We played well in the first half, but once we conceded, I don't think we had another shot on target, which isn't really good enough against a team third from bottom. We need a new input of players in the summer. This is the first Premier League season when we haven't had anything to play for at the end \u2013 either getting into Europe or battling relegation. In some ways, it's nice to have the pressure off, but it is a bit boring.

We had five or six seriously good chances to win the game. I don't really fancy Newcastle or Middlesbrough to win next week, but I'm concerned Newcastle will get a point to go above us on goal difference. A lot will depend on what sort of team Man United put out \u2013 at least Manucho can't play against them. He was absolutely awful.

We started OK in the first half but never had a shot on goal, more knocking around \u2013 then they scored a wonder goal. It must have been 35 or 40 yards out, just a good shot. I'm chuffed that Saha got the two goals and it was great for his confidence. The second half was easy football and Moyes could make a few substitutions \u2013 it realy went to plan . Absolutely outstanding, a carnival atmosphere. On to Wembley.

The most interesting thing about the game was the state of Fellaini's haircut, which is something to behold. He looks like he has been dragged through a hedge backwards. Our goal came out of nowhere. We lacked energy and precision. Everton defended quite deep but were always looking to push forward and won by the same scorline as the corresponding fixture at Upton Park.

They had the best of the play, as we struggled to find our stride and wasted a few chances. Ronaldo had an iffy game against Wigan and continued that form here. Any other time in the season this would have been a bad result but, put into context, a point was all we needed. Next week, I think Fergie will rest players who will figure in the Champions League final. I'd take \u00a370 million-plus for Ronaldo in the summer. No player is bigger than the club.

Their players knew that all they needed was a draw which made it a dull game of few chances. Arsenal had most of possession, but lacked the killer ball in the final third. We need two players this summer: a combative midfielder \u2013 which will allow Cesc F\u00e0bregas to play his natural game with greater freedom \u2013 and a commanding centre-half.

On paper, Boro aren't a bad side but tactics and motivation have been an issue. We've got to remain positive as there's a very remote chance of retaining our Premier League status. But we're looking for a miracle . From Uefa Cup final to potential relegation in three years. Southgate has a lot to answer for.

He played Milner at right- back and then Heskey, Carew and Agbonlahor all up front. There was no balance. It didn't make sense. Heskey is a donkey and O'Neill is too stubborn to see it. He plays him just to make a point. We had a pretty good season, but we don't have enough players. Next season Randy Lerner has to splash the cash and O'Neill has to buy quality. Petrov has been my player of the season.

Fulham looked a good side on the ball \u2013 at times it felt they had three or four extra players on the pitch . The sending-off seemed a bit harsh. When you're at the bottom of the league these kind of decisions seem to go against you. I'm not 100% sure why our goal was disallowed. Bassong and Martins showed commitment. Butt and Duff were past their best when they joined the club.

For long periods we were in control and, although we weren't at our best, I never really thought we were going to concede. Kamara played really well, linking up well with Nevland, and it was his pace that led to the sending-off. Schwarzer has made a huge difference for us in goal this year. We're on the brink of Europe \u2013 an amazing achievement by Roy Hodgson.

Both teams had nothing to play for and some of the players were guilty of having their minds on the summer. But things were a lot different after the break. Both sides played with a higher tempo and pushed forward. It was good to finish the season on a high after being written off by so many at the start of the campaign. I was surprised how few fans travelled from Wigan. Amdy Faye's performance was excellent. Player ratings Sorensen 8; Shawcross 8, Cort 7, Ab Faye 9, Wilkinson 7; Lawrence 8, Whelan 8, Delap 7, Etherington 7; Fuller 8, Beattie 8 Mark Ashurst, Observer reader It was embarrassing in the second half. We had 41 points in March and here we are in May with only 42, having played lots of teams in the bottom half of the table. One or two players need to ask questions of themselves and so possibly does the manager, Steve Bruce. How did Paul Scharner end up playing up front when we had a perfectly good striker sitting on the bench? Mido did come on later but it was all over by then. Only Titus Bramble emerged with any credit.

A draw would have been a fair result ... but I couldn't believe how unmotivated City players were. Assou-Ekotto is the most improved player in the Premier League, but Robbie Keane today was beyond derision. Ledley King was impeccable and the crowd was behind him ... but if the players can't impose self-discipline it has to be done for them, so the club's right to have a strong reaction.

A lot of the players looked as though they're playing for their futures elsewhere. We do not even know if the manager will be here next season \u2013 which is the usual end-of-season uncertainty for City. I wish the owners would come out and say Hughes is staying, because we need stability. We can't be saying these same things this time next year.
