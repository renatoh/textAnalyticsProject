The modern celebrity knows they've really made it when they've been sold down the river by a close relative. It's a rite of passage into super stardom, a celebrity tradition established by. Drew Barrymore, who sought legal emancipation from her mother at the tender age of 15. Which is maybe what Lindsay Lohan thought when she discovered that her grandmother had been selling childhood pictures and videos of her to the highest bidder. What Christina Aguilera realised when she learned that her grandmother thought she 'dressed like a 'ho' in the Lady Marmalade video. And what Eminem thought when his mum sued him for defamation. But we're not 100 per cent sure about that. They could of course have just felt annoyed, betrayed, surprised and hurt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
