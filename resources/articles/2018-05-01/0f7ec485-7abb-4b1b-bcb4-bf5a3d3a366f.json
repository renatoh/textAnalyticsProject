Kayakers found Haddad dead in the Lane Cove river in Sydney late in April at about the same time her former partner Mario Marcelo Santoro flew home to Rio de Janeiro ahead of schedule. Santoro has been identified by police as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d but they have not labelled him a suspect. Guardian Australia previously reported that police in New South Wales had begun liaising with Brazilian police in an attempt to find Santoro. But on Tuesday the Australian reported that a family spokeswoman said Santoro would return to Sydney with documents to prove he had changed his flights to return to Brazil early to visit his dying father. Santoro\u2019s aunt Jaisa Ferreira dos Santo reportedly told the Australian through a translator that her nephew was planning to return to Australia \u201cwith several documents that proved his father\u2019s illness, hospitalisations and other things\u201d to clarify his early departure. Police were not aware that Santoro was planning to return to Australia. The woman told the Australian that Haddad had been \u201clike family\u201d but she had never been Santoro\u2019s lover, which contradicts other accounts from Haddad\u2019s family, friends and police. Santoro and Haddad were both partners in a company called D.Care, which was registered in November last year. The company was registered at Haddad\u2019s address in Ryde and police sources have previously said that Santoro had been living at the apartment before Haddad asked him to leave in the weeks leading up to her death. There was no sign of a break-in at her home. Brazilian-born Haddad arrived in Australia more than a decade ago and moved to Sydney in 2016. Most recently she had worked as a consultant for the Australian Rail Track Corporation in Newcastle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
