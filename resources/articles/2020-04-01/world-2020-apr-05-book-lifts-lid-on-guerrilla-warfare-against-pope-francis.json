Cardinal Robert Sarah, a prelate from Guinea who heads the Vatican\u2019s liturgy department, has sought to present an alternative leadership model for the global Roman Catholic church, Christopher Lamb claims in The Outsider. \u201cCardinal Sarah has established himself as a \u2018parallel\u2019 authority to Francis, through his books, lectures, and frequent travel to conservative outposts,\u201d writes Lamb, Vatican correspondent for Catholic weekly magazine The Tablet for the past five years. \u201cHe does not directly confront or criticise the pope but [presents] an alternative leadership model for the church. Privately, he listens to the complaints about Francis; he shares some of the concerns, although is very careful in what he says. He doesn\u2019t support the attacks, but neither does he do anything to stop them.\u201d Sarah, who is frequently tipped as a potential successor to Francis, \u201ccombines a mystical spirituality with an unbending defence of traditional Catholic teaching. Were he elected pope, he would undoubtedly harken back to Pius XII, a neo-traditionalist who would \u2018reign\u2019 as pope rather than adopt the style of the Latin American [Francis], who rolls up his sleeves and takes risks to take the church out on to the street.\u201d The cardinal is described as \u201cextraordinarily conservative\u201d and \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with women holding positions of authority in the church\u2019s charitable network. In January, Sarah co-authored, with the retired Pope Benedict a book called From the Depths of our Hearts, defending clerical celibacy just as Francis was considering easing that rule in the Amazon, where there is a shortage of priests. The book was seen as a challenge to Francis\u2019s authority. He eventually decided against opening up the priesthood to married men. Sarah has \u201cdeveloped a loyal following in conservative circles, particularly in the United States\u201d, according to Lamb. . Sarah has denied he is an opponent of Francis. \u201cI am loyal to the pope. They cannot quote a word, a phrase, a gesture in which I oppose the pope, it is ridiculous,\u201d he said last year. His spokesperson did not respond to the Observer\u2019s request for comment. Lamb\u2019s book cites more than 100 instances of attacks on Francis\u2019s papacy. Opposition to Francis is not just theological, but political, he writes. \u201cSome in the church have entered into alliances with political figures, such as Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, and Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s [former] deputy prime minister, to try and thwart the pope. Francis, who has repeatedly urged the world to build bridges rather than walls, to push for dialogue and unity instead of division, has become a prime target for supporters of the Trumpian, populist politics gaining traction across Europe.\u201d According to Lamb, US Catholic donors have cut off funding under Francis, furious at their loss of influence and in protest at the pope\u2019s pronouncements on capitalism, the environment, refugees and inequality. \u201cNo one can buy their way into one of Francis\u2019s masses \u2026 You are more likely to hear mass celebrated by the pope if you are a Vatican gardener than if you have donated millions.\u201d According to Lamb, \u201ceveryone agrees, whether they are on the so-called conservative or liberal end of the spectrum, that the open opposition against [Francis] has not been seen in centuries, if ever \u2026 Worldly and clerical establishments, whether from Donald Trump and Fox News to conservative cardinals and an influential Catholic media network, have been engaged in guerrilla warfare against this pontificate.\u201d This article was updated on 14 April 2020 to remove a reference we were unable to substantiate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
