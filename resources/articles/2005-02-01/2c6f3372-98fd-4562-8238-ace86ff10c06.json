The British No1 beat Igor Andreev 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 after beating compatriot Greg Rusedski in a thriller on Tuesday. Henman had to save two break points in the first set and his confidence would have taken a massive boost in a tournament he has consistently failed to get to grips with. Henman had been wary of the 21-year-old Russian's huge serve and imposing baseline style and was not disappointed as he struggled to impose his game on his talented but erratic opponent. The first set was arguably the most thrilling since the tournament began on Monday, as the large centre court crowd, with noisy British and Russian support, witnessed Andreev's frightening power force his opponent into a series of uncharacteristic errors. Henman was undoubtedly flustered, but regained his composure at just the right time to win the tie-break, but not before throwing away two points on his serve at 6-3 up. Seeing the opening set seized from his grasp seemed to knock the stuffing out of Andreev and, as his game began to falter, so Henman's moved up through the gears. The sizeable British contingent in the crowd did not have to wait long for another trademark Henman fist-pump, after he capitalised on a double-fault to go a break up. With the Russian's head down, Henman seized his opportunity and broke again for 5-1 before holding serve to seal the victory. The No3 seed paid tribute to the crowd and the Dubai surface, despite never having advanced beyond the last eight here. \"Every game I have played here I have had phenomenal support so I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
