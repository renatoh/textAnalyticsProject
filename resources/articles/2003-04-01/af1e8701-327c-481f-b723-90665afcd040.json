Millicent King, born in 1901, had kept a continuous record of her life from 1914 to 1995. Impressed by Forster's famous memoir of her grandmother and mother, Hidden Lives, Millicent was now proposing that Forster edit her own diaries for posthumous publication. There could be no greater gift for a writer obsessed with the changing times of the 20th century, whose work, both fictional and factual, dwells on family life, and who loves, above all, to chronicle the female journey from birth to death. Still, it was with trepidation that Forster received the beautifully preserved hoard of 80 notebooks - what if it was tedious stuff, badly written, trivial to the point of tears? Forster's luck was in. Even at the age of 13, when she starts her diary, Millicent is fluid, funny, unintentionally ironic. Indeed, it is as a child that Millicent writes at her best. In later years, her writing becomes more mannered and restrained; a cool observer of her own and other lives, she is less passionate than in her youth. Yet this slight narrational arthritis, creeping upon her naturally with age, is compensated by the gripping tale she has to tell. Because it is all there, running parallel to her personal journey of love and loss: the catastrophic first world war; the darkness gathering over Europe from the 20s onwards; the blinkered disbelief that it all might happen again; the death and destruction of the second world war. Millicent is not political, nor even that social; she is not a romantic heroine but a sometimes petulant survivor. And this is the charm of the document - being private it is honest, and being honest it is often selfish and self-regarding. The emotional outpourings are frequently petty, while great griefs such as the loss of a lover in the war are recorded simply by blank pages. As readers we yearn to know the whole story, yet true life is maddeningly full of such missing explanations. And this is the fascinating record of such a life. In fact, there is only one problem with Forster's wonderful find - Millicent King was not dead by the time of publication, for the brutal reason that she was never born. For Forster, who writes both novels and biographies, has tried her hand at something new and strange - a fictionalised memoir. It could be argued that all novels written in the first person are fictionalised memoirs, yet somehow Diary of an Ordinary Woman is not simply a traditional \"novel in diary form\", but more like the incredibly detailed forgery of an unlived life. Not only is the background of social and political change meticulously accurate - unsurprising, given that Forster is the forger - but there is everything one would expect from a well-kept diary: the periods of apathy, the minor grievances that crowd out great events, the desultory attention to detail, the silly prejudices, the gradual shift in character as Millicent grows old. Strip out the words \"a novel\" from the cover, and Forster could have fooled the world. Yet, though Millicent never lived, this diary is an authentic record of how a century of English women were shaped - or, rather, distorted - by war. Anyone who cannot understand their mother or grandmother's generation can discover here what caused their emotional restraint, their passion for collecting short pieces of string, their chronic inability to cook, and above all their commitment to us, our families and our children's futures. This is fiction; yet this is true. \u00b7 Helen Falconer's novel Sky High will be published in June by Faber"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
