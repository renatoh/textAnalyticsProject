The Commons Public Accounts Committee launched an inquiry into the issue after official figures revealed that more than 2,000 people died last year as a result of medical or safety errors. In its review of the government's National Patient Safety Agency, the MPs found that it was still unable to get comprehensive information about medical and safety incidents in NHS hospitals, and had no detailed picture at all of the situation in private hospitals where patients will be able to opt for care as part of the government's choice policy. The reporting of errors and safety incidents has been increasing dramatically, and the NPSA is now getting more than 60,000 of them a month. The MPs were particularly alarmed at how long it has taken for a 'culture' of safety to begin to take root, with only one in four NHS trusts across the country routinely telling patients or their families when a mistake has occurred. One of the key problems identified by the committee was a delay in getting a reporting system in place to identify errors. When the NPSA was set up, a pilot scheme was already under way on a computer scheme developed to deal with patient safety in Australia. But the agency decided the system was not appropriate for Britain and developed its own, leaving the scheme two years behind target. The new system still doesn't routinely include potentially crucial information on 'contributory factors' when mistakes are made, the MPs found."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
