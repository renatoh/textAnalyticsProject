Because he's so simply, inscrutably drawn \u2013 just an egg for a head and two dots for eyes \u2013 it's easy to project oneself on him while reading. Anybody can be Tintin. Dom Joly, it has to be said, doesn't make for a very convincing Tintin, though. They don't have many features in common, except perhaps the dots for eyes, and even with bequiffed dyed hair and the perfect blue jumper over a buttoned-up shirt and plus fours, he's hardly a dead ringer. It is, however, an arresting look. When he grabs a Snowy lookalike in the middle of Brussels and runs off with it, the owner calls the police, and you can see why. Dom Joly and the Black Island (Channel 4)Dom Joly and the Black Island was an odd little one-off, in which the comedian, travel writer and self-proclaimed Tintinophile retraced the journey taken by his cartoon hero on his visit to the Black Island in Scotland. I wasn't familiar with the source material for Joly's adventure, but it was easy enough to put my hand to a copy. Tintin gets shot on the first page; Joly wisely skipped this bit and started on the ferry from Ostend. From there he went to the train station featured in the book (it's in Bishop's Stortford, but you'd have to be a Tintinologist, like Mr Farr, to know that) and to the Isle of Barra, and finally, a little island off that. Unlike Tintin, Joly was not on the trail of a gang of international forgers. He had no aim at all, other than to visit places Tintin visited, which is something even Herg\u00e9, Tintin's creator, didn't bother with. He drew everything from photographs. Joly is a pleasant but unnerving travel companion. He's fearless in the company of strangers in a way that makes the viewer afraid. This was the secret of Trigger Happy TV, with its giant-phone running gag. This slim adventure lacked the edge, or even the point, of that show, but it was amusing in parts, charming in others and a little gift for Tintinophiles everywhere. A Tintinologist, I fear, would not learn much he or she didn't already know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
