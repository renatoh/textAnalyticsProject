The original voice cast has been redubbed with British talent for the UK release: Dominic Cooper is the feisty young turtle Sammy \u2013 and John Hurt plays this youngster in old age, reminiscing about his adventures. Sammy meets the love of his life, Shelly, voiced by Gemma Arterton, and finds a great buddy in Ray, played by Robert Sheehan. The villain is homo sapiens, filling the beautiful ocean with spilt oil, thus endangering the turtles and every other adorable talking cartoon creature. It's a laudable message of course, but there's something earnest, lifeless and school-projectish about the whole affair. Compared to Finding Nemo, of which its visuals and script are a feeble copy, it looks underpowered and the voice-work is often a bit laboured. Of course, it might be suitable for very young children, but even the littlest kids might sense that they've been offered smarter, zappier and frankly better films than this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
