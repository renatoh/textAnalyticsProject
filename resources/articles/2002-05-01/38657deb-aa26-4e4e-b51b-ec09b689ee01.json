He had made his Premiership debut only a year earlier and his first appearance in an England shirt came less than three months before Glenn Hoddle's squad arrived in France. By the time they returned he was, at 18, a world star. \"You weren't under any pressure,\" he says now, trying to put the experience into perspective. \"You go to your first World Cup and you've got the advantage of no one knowing you. Being 18, you're not scared of anything; you don't even think about anything, you just go out and do it. Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham were the first-choice partnership and there were some great players on the bench. I was happy just to get five minutes in one game and say I'd played in the World Cup. That would have been great.\" This time, he says, the feeling is very different. \"There were advantages then and there are different advantages now. I'm four years older, wiser, more experienced. I've played over 30 games for England and I've played against world-class players, so I've got that advantage now. Maybe the disadvantage is that people have watched me play a little bit more but just because they've watched you doesn't mean they'll be able to stop you. You have to find other ways of trying to beat them. It's just the next step, really.\" For England Owen's next step has become nothing less than crucial. Four years ago he was the surprise weapon, not even wholly trusted by his coach, who left him out of the first game altogether and brought him on as a substitute only when England were struggling against Romania, to be rewarded with an immediate goal. Hoddle did not make that mistake again, although his successor, Kevin Keegan, was to repeat it. For Sven-Goran Eriksson, surveying a suddenly depleted midfield and still anxious about the rehabilitation of David Beckham, the significance of Owen has increased rapidly in the last few weeks. Eriksson will be thinking of the two goals with which Owen won the FA Cup for Liverpool a year ago, and of the hat-trick that destroyed Germany last September. He will be thinking that in the first two of the matches since Owen took over the captaincy from the absent Beckham the little striker scored the opening goal. No big occasion or additional responsibility will overawe him. While there is Owen, you might say, there is hope. He and Beckham are the team's two authentic stars, up there with Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo in the iconography of the current game. For as long as they are in Japan or Korea they will be unable to go anywhere in public without being mobbed. \"The majority of my fan mail comes from the Far East,\" Owen said. \"Then Scandinavia, then England. But when you see the reception you get when you arrive here, it's frightening.\" He and Beckham project images that could hardly be more divergent. Beckham is married to a pop star, unveils a different hairstyle every week, likes seeing himself on the cover of magazines, has a garage full of Ferraris and lacks eloquence. Owen, who is four years younger, lives quietly with his childhood sweetheart, plays golf, drives a sponsored Jaguar, generally adheres to the sort of lifestyle enjoyed by star footballers of an earlier era and has a mind as quick as his feet. The things that unite them, apart from a gift for smiling in a way that makes those around them want to join in, are a solid family background and the memory of a turbulent night in St Etienne which shaped the destinies of both. Before Beckham was shown the red card that brought him months of infamy, Owen had scuttled out of nowhere to score the goal of the tournament. Inevitably it was a long time before people would let him forget it. \"I didn't want to be remembered just for that goal against Argentina,\" he said. \"Thankfully with Liverpool I've been able to do a few extra things. With England, too, we've had some great memories over the last few years. A lot of people expected a dip after the last World Cup, and that was inevitable. But experience only comes from playing. I've probably had about 200 games since that World Cup four years ago, and they've all been played at a high level. I've had ups and downs, injuries and whatever, but I'd settle for being where I am. \"You see so many people coming on to the scene - not just footballers but young golfers, young cricketers, young tennis players, everything - and everybody builds them up but not many can live up to expectations. I'm still in the England team and I think I've done all right. I'm an all-round better player than I was four years ago. I'm better in the air, better with my left foot, better at volleying, better at holding the ball up.\" G\u00e9rard Houllier, who encouraged him to improve his left foot and his heading, would have been delighted with his goals in England's last two internationals - a leaping header against Paraguay and an opportunist's left-foot prod against South Korea. The Liverpool manager would have been even more pleased with Owen's contribution to the club's last match of the season, a cutely weighted through-pass which led to Nicolas Anelka's goal against Ipswich. \"I would never have been in that position four years ago,\" Owen confirmed. \"I'd have been doing the running up front. I mix my game up a little bit more now. But I'd never want to take away from my main asset, which is trying to get in behind defenders.\" The faith shown by Eriksson has given him eight goals in 12 games under the Swede, a remarkable average, compared with eight in 24 under Hoddle and Keegan. \"It's probably because I'm playing all the time now,\" Owen said. \"If you're the lead striker, you're less likely to be getting taken off. You can be nervous about the responsibility or you can just enjoy it. It gives you the incentive to do well.\" Added burden When Eriksson asked him to shoulder an extra responsibility, he took it in his stride. \"I was hoping for the captaincy in my late twenties, maybe. To get it at such a young age was a shock.\" And had the coach said anything about what he required from his captain? \"No. I think he chose me because he knew what I did.\" It is a source of sadness to Owen that he will not be accompanied in the World Cup - this one, at least - by Steven Gerrard. They joined the Liverpool academy when they were both 11 years old and they have profited from each other's gifts all the way from youth level through to last year's England triumph in Munich. But the man Owen calls \"my main supplier\" will not be there in Saitama on Sunday. \"Steven's very disappointed, of course,\" he said, \"and the whole country's disappointed because he's one of the best players in the world, let alone in England. Every team in the world would miss a Steven Gerrard. But he's in that period, as I was, when he's still not fully grown. I was taller than him five years ago and now he's six inches taller than me. You've got to give your body time to grow with it. Unfortunately it's catching up with him. It's a bitter blow because obviously he would have had something to give here. He could have done big things. But every country will suffer similar blows.\" Having endured problems of his own with his hamstrings in particular - the result, it is said, of being asked to play all the year round as a teenager, participating in summer tournaments with schools and youth teams - he is acutely aware of the sufferings of his fellow members of the England squad and spoke of the anxiety a player feels when he returns to action. \"It's probably because the last thing you did on a football pitch was when it happened. The last sprint you did, that's when you felt it. So the first real sprint you do when you come back, you do get a bit nervous. But it only takes a few sprints to get rid of that. I do certain special exercises with the physio, a lot of stretching, before I go out for every match. But match day is not when you do your main stuff. It's in between when you do your strengthening and your extra work. I do as much of that as possible. But you can't help getting injured. You can't go half-pace in a World Cup against the best players in the world. There's no hiding place.\" Owen would not be Owen if he did not, when asked to predict England's fortunes in the coming weeks, provide an assessment blending optimism with a shrewd realism. \"You run a risk if you say, 'I think we'll be a better team in four years' time,' because people will say, 'He doesn't fancy it for this one,' and obviously that's not the case. I think we're one of eight teams that have got a very good chance. Obviously France and Argentina stand out a bit ahead of us but, if we played them in a one-off, then we wouldn't be scared of it. Whatever happens in this World Cup, people should remember that we've got a very young side. Six years ago France started where we are now, and look what they did. I certainly think we've got the potential to do that.\" As for the current European footballer of the year, he speaks of looking for new targets. Michael Owen would be the last footballer alive to claim that he has nothing to prove. \"Whenever you do something, there's always the next thing to think about,\" he said. \"There's always a question to answer and there will probably always be one until the day I retire.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
