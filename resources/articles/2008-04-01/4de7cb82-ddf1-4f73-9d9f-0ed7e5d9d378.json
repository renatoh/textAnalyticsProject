Originally written for clarinet, bassoon and piano, its scoring seems to be a movable feast, allowing the series' presiding genius, Steven Isserlis, to substitute his cello when joining clarinettist Martin Fr\u00f6st and pianist Kirill Gerstein. An unassumingly attractive work rather than a great one, its charm was adeptly realised in this performance, notably in the way all three players floated the Italian aria-like melody of the slow movement, clearly influenced by Bellini, whom Glinka had recently met in Milan. The Russians may have been slow in getting started with chamber music, but they made up for it later, producing in Borodin's 1881 Second String Quartet one of the most magical works ever composed for the medium. The consistently imaginative writing, however, needed sharper presentation than it received from the Jerusalem Quartet, with some ill-judged balance and lapses in intonation from both violinists. The delicate sensuousness of those sections that later found their way into the borrowed-from-Borodin score of the 1953 musical Kismet was scarcely exploited. Perhaps the Jerusalem just need to play the piece in. Ironically, it was the least plausible work on the programme, the strenuous Second Piano Quintet by Sergei Taneyev - a pupil of Tchaikovsky and the teacher of Skryabin and Rachmaninov - that received the most determined advocacy. Scored with barely relenting heaviness, this ornately brocaded armchair of a piece lumbers along with an almost bludgeoning impact, its turgid manner overwhelming instead of highlighting some commonplace ideas. Not even the combined efforts of Isserlis, Gerstein, violinist Baiba Skride and two of the Jerusalem players could keep it in the air. \u00b7 The series continues tonight.
