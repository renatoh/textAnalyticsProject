Swansea have lost their way since a bright start to the season, picking up only one win from their past nine matches in all competitions, and Monk needs no telling that results need to improve. He is dismayed, however, at reports that emerged in the wake of the defeat against Norwich City in the last round of Premier League matches, when it was suggested that Swansea would sack him, and talked about \u201coutside influences\u201d being at work. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve been disappointed with a some of the things that were written, I think a lot of it has been irresponsible, I think it\u2019s people trying to take things out of context and have an agenda behind it,\u201d Monk said. \u201cBut those people are nothing to do with Swansea City and I can\u2019t control what people say out of here. The thing I need to focus on is what is said within the walls of Swansea City.\u201d Monk laughed at the suggestion he had held \u201ccrisis talks\u201d with Jenkins after losing at Carrow Road. \u201cIt\u2019s so wide of the truth. I have a great relationship with Huw, we have regular communication all the time. I don\u2019t have to be spoken to by anyone to understand my situation, you have to get results, it\u2019s as simple as that. What you\u2019ve learned from management in recent seasons is that if you don\u2019t pick up results in a short space of time, your job can come under threat. But I don\u2019t need anyone to tell me that and no one has told me that.\u201d Swansea host a struggling Bournemouth side on Saturday in what will be seen by many as a must-win game for the Welsh club, especially with a tricky run of fixtures to come. Monk, who led Swansea to eighth place last season, their highest Premier League finish, spoke about the importance of everyone showing unity to turn things around. \u201cI have considered the situation in my own head and no one puts more pressure on me than myself and no one has been more frustrated than me with this period and run of results,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not going to cry about it or go into a shell, I am going to come out fighting, show character and spirit and what you believe in and make sure the players do the same and put it right on the pitch.\u201d Although Pep Clotet has been linked with the Brentford job, Monk insisted that his assistant manager would not be going anywhere. \u201cIt is a non-starter. It is speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have discussed things but he is as determined as me to make sure we come through things. We know we are not all going to be here forever but we are focused on Swansea and continuing the good job we have done and he is as committed as I am.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
