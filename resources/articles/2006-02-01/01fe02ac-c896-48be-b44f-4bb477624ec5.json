Because it's not about cartoons. Or religion. Or protest, or Europe, or diversity. And it's definitely not about you. What it's about? It's about me. I'm offended. There, I've said it. Hurt, even. Why? Because, in case you've been too excited to notice, it's become fashionable, in the past few days, to claim that British journalists, including yours truly, have avoided telling it like it is. We're soft. I have even heard it said that us senior commentators are a bunch of cringing yellowbellies who could learn a thing or two from the BBC, which \"bravely\" (and to my mind, quite recklessly) showed a glimpse of the scribbles in question; who could even take lessons in truth-telling from a few nameless (and, to my mind, singularly ill-mannered) cartoonists hailing from the land of the stinking rollmop. That, my friends, is where this thing gets personal. Because if Norm is known for anything then it is for saying the unsayable. Even if I have to swear in the process. That's the way I was brought up by my old dad - a fierce critic of capitalism in all its forms - and that's how I have stayed. Unrepentantly bloody (!) so. You'll know, by now, how I hate to blow my own trumpet, but I would point out to any so-called champions of free speech that you're currently reading a piece by the winner of the 1999 Richard and Judy Media Prize, which goes to the guest who Richard and Judy think has done most to stimulate controversy. In my case with a piece that began - in typically iconoclastic mode - as follows: \"The next time I want a new pair of socks, I certainly shan't be shopping at Marks &amp; Spencer.\" And you know what? I don't regret a bloody word. Bollocks to that. Someone's got to speak out, even if it means a call from the M&amp;S PR, asking if I'd like to check out their model factory in Bali (a real credit to enlightened market forces, I'm happy to report). That's why I often use the word \"fart\". And \"piss\". So no lectures, please, about cowardice masquerading as restraint for the first person to ask: \"Are the Arctic Monkeys all they're cracked up to be?\" In politics, too, I'll speak as I find. \"Time for Blair to go?\" I asked last year. \"That's not the mood music I'm hearing.\" And where religion is involved I take no prisoners. As you will know if you saw my piece about the new pope: \"Bent as a nine-bob note.\" I don't care which faith is involved. \"No mercy for this psychotic Anglican\" was my verdict on CS Lewis, even before I saw his film. Don't get me wrong. I'm totally aware that free speech must be tempered by respect for people's sensibilities. Including mine. Anyone who has been feeling hurt this week will probably understand how hurt I feel when I'm accused of lacking the guts to offend people. Look: if that were the case, why would I risk - with my lonely decision not to contribute to the current hysteria - inflaming this country's entire secular community? Just because these extreme humanists don't shout murder in the streets doesn't make them harmless rationalists. The minute I announced, over on my blog - Norm's Place - that, for the next few weeks, I'd be posting, exclusively, from my new pregnancy diary - \"In Praise of Older Dads\" - the insults started flooding in. \"Boring.\" \"Pathetic.\" \"You just fell off my Christmas-card list.\" What was it George Orwell once said? \"If you haven't got anything nice to say, you can just fuck off.\" \u00b7 Email: norman.johnson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
