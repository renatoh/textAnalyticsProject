She was second on and Michaela Breeze made sure she savoured every moment of being the first woman to represent Britain in weightlifting at the Olympic Games. \"Come on\" chanted the PE teacher from Wales when she stepped on to the platform and with that the three groups of British fans responded, waving flags and making enough noise to allow their favourite to know she was not alone. By her fifth attempt, her efforts to meet the \"pressure\" she somehow thought she was under became too much. She needed smelling salts before equalling her personal best in the clean and jerk category. Having succeeded at 120kg, she then failed at 122.5kg. She ended the competition in ninth position and by the time she was dashing away to buy an ice cream - her first treat for six weeks - Yanging Chen of China was aiming to break the world record. \"Did you see the line-up?\" said Breeze. \"I am 5ft 6in and weigh 58 kilos and they are 4ft nothing and weigh the same. They are not short of stock and do not have far to move the weights.\" Breeze was the tallest in the field but without doubt the most vociferous. While most of her opponents took a small bow before their lift, the Briton did her best to gain as much support as she could. It was fabulous entertainment and back home, her pupils would have been proud of \"Breezy\". Two of the youngsters she coaches had sent her text messages before she had even finished her competition and she will now pass on to them the experience she gained from being part of this occasion. \"I equalled my PB [personal best] which I am happy with, but I missed a couple of lifts because I gambled,\" she said. \"Having lifted 95kg [in the snatch], I thought I would go for it at 97.5 to try to stay with these girls. They were lifting some awesome weights.\" Each competitor has three attempts at the snatch and three at the clean and jerk. The disconcerting factor for Breeze, 25, would have been that she had completed the first session before three of her opponents had even lifted. It was then that Chen cleared 107.5kg, before securing the gold medal with 130kg in the second half of the programme, just not being strong enough to hold on to 135kg which would have broken the world record. But her snatch and total score were Olympic records, reward for a woman who was the last to be selected for the Chinese weightlifting team a year ago. Since then she has received enough funding and support from her country to compete full-time while Breeze, though supported by the lottery, remains a teacher at Ivybridge Community College, Devon, where many of her pupils are competitors in the sport. Weightlifting for women became an Olympic discipline in Sydney four years ago and Breeze is the best in the country, qualifying after finishing fourth in the European Championships in Kiev in April. \"In the 122.5 clean and jerk, it was the first time I had ever got under it,\" she said. \"The minor problem was standing up but it was good with the pressure I was under. \"You know there are people back home expecting big things, so I am hoping I did not disappoint. It is a lonely world to be full-time. If you do not have the training partners or full-time coaching and the medical back-up you need, it is virtually impossible. My coach does not even live where I do. We do a lot of the communication over the phone. I see him once or twice a month so my job keeps my mind going.\" Meeting the weight for this 58-category has not been easy. Breeze has been on a strict diet for six weeks, losing over 6kg and it started to take an effect. \"I had a couple of jam rolls before I competed to raise my sugar levels,\" she said. \"But it was hot out there and I used smelling salts to clear my head as I was feeling a bit dizzy in the warm up room. \"When you sit around waiting, your legs can go to sleep. I could not feel my legs and even on the platform I could feel my whole body shaking. Now the first thing on the menu is ice cream.\" Along with three large scoops of pride."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
