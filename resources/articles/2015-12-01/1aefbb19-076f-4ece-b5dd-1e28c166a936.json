The second in line to the throne is sent confidential papers from the very top of government \u201coccasionally\u201d and \u201cwhen relevant\u201d, a royal source confirmed. This follows news of the little-known access granted to Charles to the highest-level government dossiers, which was exposed in the Guardian on Tuesday after a three-year freedom of information battle by Republic, the campaign for an elected head of state. The government justified Charles\u2019s access to the high level cabinet memorandums, which even ministers of state do not see, because he was heir to the throne. On Wednesday night it said William\u2019s access was because he was \u201cfuture heir to the throne\u201d. The Guardian understands the amount of material William receives is more modest than that given to Charles or the Queen and includes material relating to countries where he is engaged in official overseas visits. \u201cThe Duke of Cambridge is a senior member of the royal family and future heir to the throne and therefore of course it is appropriate that he is regularly briefed on government business,\u201d a Cabinet Office spokesman said. But Republic\u2019s chief executive, Graham Smith, said: \u201cThere appears to be no good reason why William is getting this information. There is no mention of this access in the documents released this week. It appears to be a free-for-all.\u201d Labour has called for an inquiry, which Smith supports \u201cso we can know how much information is being handed to which royals\u201d. Charles \u201cis one of the most powerful lobbyists in the country and he has more information than some of the ministers he is lobbying\u201d, said Clive Lewis MP, a shadow minister. \u201cThat is not right or proper. There needs to be more transparency about his powers and his access to confidential briefings. Who authorises them and why has it been kept secret? It undermines public confidence in our democratic processes if you have to drag this information kicking and screaming into the daylight.\u201d On Wednesdsay night the Cabinet Office declined to confirm or deny whether William was receiving cabinet files or comment on whether any other royals were. Prof Adam Tomkins, a constitutional lawyer, said Charles risked damaging the monarchy if he used the highly confidential cabinet papers to assist his lobbying. Tomkins, a professor of public law at Glasgow University, said: \u201cThe heir to the throne has unique access, with the Queen, both to government papers and to ministers. Were they minded to do so, they would be able to use that access to lobby. \u201cThe Queen has acted in an exemplary manner by not doing that and Charles should behave like she does. To the extent that he doesn\u2019t, he risks damaging the institution of the monarchy.\u201d Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons constitutional affairs committee, said ministers should have been more open about Charles\u2019s access, but added that it was outrageous to describe him as a lobbyist. Jenkin said: \u201cHe only acts in the public interest. It is his view of the public interest but I expect the vast majority of this country support that.\u201d Jenkin is facing calls from a Labour member of his committee, Paul Flynn, to investigate Charles\u2019s access to cabinet papers. Flynn warned that there was \u201ca great nervousness\u201d among parliamentarians about raising the issue of Charles\u2019s interaction with government \u201cbecause it is so full of matters that are illogical and indefensible and people don\u2019t want to disturb it\u201d. Ed Davey, the former Liberal Democrat MP, who had two private meetings with Charles while he was secretary of state for energy and climate change, said he was \u201cvery relaxed\u201d about Charles receiving the papers. He said Charles was \u201cvery well informed and not just from the cabinet papers\u201d. \u201cWe were in total agreement on our views and I didn\u2019t feel lobbied,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was against taking action on climate change the meetings might have been more frustrating.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
