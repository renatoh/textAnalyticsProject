The journal is among 470,000 documents collected from the house where Bin Laden died that were released by the CIA on Wednesday. The agency said it had released the treasure trove \u201cin the interest of transparency and to enhance public understanding of al-Qaida and [bin Laden].\u201d Though there have been previous reports that Bin Laden travelled to the west, this is the first confirmation. An entry in the nondescript school notebook describes how Bin Laden first travelled to \u201cthe west\u201d for an unspecified \u201ctreatment\u201d when he was in \u201csixth grade\u201d and 13 years old. The following year the teenager, the wealthy son of a billionaire Saudi construction tycoon, spent 10 weeks in Britain \u201cstudying\u201d. Bin Laden gives no further details, but he has previously been reported to have taken an English language course at Oxford. In the journal, Bin Laden briefly describes visiting the home of William Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon but says he was \u201cnot impressed\u201d by British society and culture during his time in the UK. \u201cI got the impression that they were a loose people, and my age didn\u2019t allow me to form a complete picture of life there,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe went every Sunday to visit Shakespeare\u2019s house. I was not impressed and I saw that they were a society different from ours and that they were a morally loose society.\u201d The journal was bought in a well-known bookshop in Pakistan a few hours drive from the garrison town of Abbottabad, where Bin Laden spent five years with his family before his death. The journal appears to be partially written by Bin Laden\u2019s son, Khalid, who was also killed in the Navy Seal raid, and sometimes takes the form of a question and answer session between father and son. The journal entries are at times apocalyptic, describing the two men\u2019s dreams and visions, including a scenario in which Muslim countries unite after the revolutions and peace is established with the west \u2013 a prelude to the end times in some branches of Islamic theology. At other times, Bin Laden appears more practical, discussing recommendations for al-Qaida\u2019s messaging in the aftermath of the revolutions to better capitalize on rising Islamist sentiments and to take advantage of the wave of popular unrest. Bin Laden\u2019s mention of his feelings towards the west after his time in Britain will interest experts. Most accounts of his life say he was radicalised as a student and later when he became engaged as a volunteer organiser for Arab foreign fighters taking part in the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan from around 1981. The US government has released hundreds of documents over recent years, though this is the largest such release. The US-based website, The Long War Journal, received some material in advance and reported that the documents give new details of al-Qaida\u2019s relationship with Iran. One 19-page document contains a senior militant\u2019s assessment of the group\u2019s relationship with Iran, which describes an offer by Iran to provide some unidentified \u201cSaudi brothers\u201d with \u201cmoney, arms\u201d and \u201ctraining in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, in exchange for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf\u201d. It is not known if the offer was accepted \u2013 if it was made at all \u2013 and the inclusion of the document will raise suspicion that one motive for the release of the new hoard was to place material that casts Iran in a bad light in the public domain. Mike Pompeo, the Trump-appointed director of the CIA, has a reputation for an aggressively hawkish stance on Iran. It has been known for some time that scores of senior al-Qaida officials and their families were held in Iran after fleeing there in the aftermath of 2011. However, the relationship between the detained militants and their captors was tense, and no solid evidence of active cooperation on terrorist operations has yet emerged. Among the material released by the CIA was some which suggested Bin Laden\u2019s time in the UK may have had a deeper influence than he may have admitted. Loaded on one computer was video of the Rowan Atkinson comedy Mr Bean dubbed in Pashtu, the local language in western Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, episodes of the animated programme Wallace and Gromit, and the viral video \u201cCharlie bit my finger\u201d. There were also more than 30 videos on crocheting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
