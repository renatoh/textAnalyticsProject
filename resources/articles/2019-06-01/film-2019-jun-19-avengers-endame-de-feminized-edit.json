Someone has 'defeminised' Avengers: Endgame", "bodyText": "Like me, you probably hated Avengers: Endgame because it contained too many components that you ideologically oppose. Like women, for instance. And homosexuality. And feelings. And women. God, women, yuck. So it gives me enormous relief to inform you that someone has fixed Avengers: Endgame for good. An anonymous internet user has re-edited Endgame and posted it to torrent sites under the new \u2013 and, if anything, catchier \u2013 title Avengers Endgame De-Feminized Edit AKA Anti-Cheese-Cut. The new film itself is quite hard to come by, but luckily the user detailed most of the major changes in a note. The headline takeaway is that it\u2019s \u201cEndgame, but shorter, no feminism, no gay shit, less boring filler, less sniffing its own farts, no constant quips and other small changes\u201d. Digging in a little, the user goes on to state that the edit contains \u201cabsolutely no Brie Larson\u201d and \u201cless kitchen psychology\u201d. The scene of Hawkeye training his daughter has been removed, because \u201cyoung women should learn skills to become good wives and mothers\u201d. Tony Stark no longer asks \u201chis wife\u2019s permission to save the universe\u201d. There are much fewer women in the final battle, since \u201cthey should be at home taking care of their kids\u201d. And, most importantly, the Ancient One \u2013 Sorcerer Supreme, leader of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, centuries-long unconquerable protector of Earth \u2013 now just hands the time stone over because she \u201cgets scared of Hulk\u201d and the fact that she didn\u2019t immediately do this in the original was \u201ca giant plothole\u201d. Oh, and Black Panther isn\u2019t in it as much for some reason. Not sure why, really. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but I\u2019m thrilled that this user has gone to the trouble of improving Endgame like this. He (or she, I\u2019m not sexist) has seen how dangerously underserved straight white men are in society, and filled the void by giving us exactly what we want to watch; a load of other straight white men gruffly rejecting anything that doesn\u2019t conform to our brittle, terrified worldviews. His (or her, but probably his) edit has turned Avengers: Endgame into the film that we always wanted it to be. That film, thank heavens, is The Expendables 3. Even better, it looks like this might be part of a trend. Last year a different user gave us The Last Jedi: De-Feminized Fanedit (AKA The Chauvinist Cut), a 46-minute bad-fan romp where Leia \u201cnever scolds, questions or demotes Poe\u201d, Kylo Ren is generally \u201cmore badass\u201d, Rose Tico (referred to here as \u201cAsian chick\u201d) doesn\u2019t have as many lines and \u201cis never formally introduced\u201d, and Captain Phasma is killed much more quickly because \u201cwomen are naturally weaker than men\u201d. This is absolutely how we should be watching films now. The problem with Hollywood movies is that they\u2019re all made by experts, and we live in post-expert times. Why can\u2019t we just hack out all the parts of a film that we don\u2019t like? After all, this is exactly how Donald Trump chooses to watch movies. If he can manage to cut the fat out of Bloodsport \u2013 a film that is basically one long unbroken grunt \u2013 then we should be able to do the same to any films stupid enough to contain any female characters that aren\u2019t simply two-dimensional submissive sexbots. The question now is which film will be defeminised next. My hope is that it\u2019s Captain Marvel, a film that was rendered unwatchable by its insistence on a) having a female lead, b) refusing to include any shots of the lead sucking her fingers in just her bra and c) letting the lead fight people instead of just cleaning her house because she knew that her husband would get angry if he came home and just found her sitting around and getting fat. Perhaps some internet hero is working on it as we speak. Perhaps soon we will be treated to his (or her) 15-minute version of Captain Marvel, where Jude Law and Samuel L Jackson just endlessly stare into each other\u2019s eyes before they start kissing. Fighting! I meant fighting. Nothing to see here. Anyway, great chat. See you on the straight pride march."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
