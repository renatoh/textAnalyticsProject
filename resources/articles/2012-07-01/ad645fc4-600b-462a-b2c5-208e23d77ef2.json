See how my thinking was going? But his mother wouldn't let me, said that I should look at him as an actual person, and as my son, not simply a device to get a couple of extra lines of copy out of. At which point I should have quoted this Professor Edward Melhuish from the programme, who says taking babies to work isn't just about saving on childcare, not stepping off the career ladder, seeing more of your kids etc. It could well be beneficial to the development of the baby too (ha, Prof Melhuish has obviously never been inside the Guardian offices). But she would have said that the only reason I go into the office, instead of working at home, which I could do, is to get away from the baby. Which is true. And if he was here, I really wouldn't get much done. We'd be too busy doing our special dances, and singing our special songs, which might be annoying for my colleagues (and embarrassing, as some of the songs are about some of my colleagues). No, it would be hopeless. They are more enlightened at Britain's largest minicab firm, Addison Lee. The ones who wanted to go in the bus lanes, remember? Boss John Griffin is letting eight of his staff bring their babies and toddlers through the doors, so long as they don't disrupt things too much or damage the brand. Actually I think Mr Griffin is canny enough to realise that a two-part BBC documentary in which he can demonstrate how progressive and family-friendly he is will do very nicely indeed thank you for the brand. So in the babies come, and they do a fair amount of disruption. Fewer calls are made, performance figures drop, the drivers don't get paid (hmmm, I'm not sure I actually believe that one, it looks a bit manufactured for the film, for extra drama). But even if less work is being done, the office is probably nicer with the babies about \u2013 livelier, happier, bubblier (literally, because call-centre team manager Tohier is blowing them), more colourful (especially with little Laila's bright pink Penelope Pitstop car-walky-thing). And obviously the babies are benefiting enormously from the minicab office experience. It's just a one-day trial to start with. If it doesn't work out, John Griffin can call it just that, a day, and pull the plug. He's not going to do that now though; there's a whole other part to come, an hour of lovely brand-boosting publicity. He's got one of the babies in his office now, pushing a car around the carpet. Bang, it goes into the leg of a table. \"That's what our drivers do,\" he says, good-humouredly. \"They drive into lots of things.\" Yeah, like cyclists. That's right, it wasn't just the bus-lane controversy, there were John Griffin's comments about cyclists too, remember? That collisions with them were inevitable, and it wasn't the fault of his drivers. Perhaps the brand could use all the help it can get. Anyway, he may hate cyclists, and black-cab drivers, but he loves families, and mothers, and most of all babies. Bring them to work, in an Addison Lee minicab obviously, not on a bicycle. I was disappointed by Usain Bolt: The Fastest Man Alive (BBC1). Not by the documentary, a thorough and fascinating profile that did all the right things, talked to the right people, showed the right footage of the greatest living athlete flying down the track, destroying opponents and records alike. But by the man himself. I wanted so much for him to be an excellent person as well as an excellent athlete (I'll be honest, I've felt an affinity with him, have seen myself very much as the Usain Bolt of TV criticism). But here he's hard to like. He's got the arrogance and swagger he's perfectly entitled to have, but not the wit or the charm to carry it off. A shame. Oh well, he can run very fast, I'll give him that. Is Paxman going soft, mellowing with age? In this first in the new series of University Challenge (BBC2) he produces not a single snort of derision nor a sigh of exasperation at a foolish answer. He doesn't shout \"Come on!\" impatiently and wearisomely. He even describes Trinity Laban's losing score of 105 as \"very respectable\". No, no, no, Jeremy, that's not what anyone expects \u2013 or wants \u2013 from you. Let's hope this new generosity and warm-heartedness is a blip, and he returns to form next week. Oh, and Trinity Laban, 105 is a disgrace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
