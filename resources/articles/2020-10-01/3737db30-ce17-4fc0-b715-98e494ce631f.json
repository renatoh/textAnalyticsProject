Morgan is one of 10 England players to bounce from a condensed home summer behind closed doors to the current Indian Premier League and faces less than a fortnight at home before a white-ball tour of South Africa departs on 17 November. The six-match trip, which is expected to be approved this week, will see the squad confined to just the team hotel in Cape Town and the grounds at Newlands and Paarl, meaning little escape from the pressures of performance. With no end in sight for such restrictions and a backlog of international fixtures to make up, England\u2019s one-day captain is keen to create an environment where players feel able to flag up concerns and even sit out a series if required. Speaking at an online event for the cricket charity Chance to Shine, Morgan said: \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about this [issue] as a team and we\u2019ve accepted that guys will come in and out of the bubble if they feel it is affecting their mental health. I do think we will see people pull out of tours. That is just going to be the reality of things. I don\u2019t think people should look down on it and they shouldn\u2019t feel like people aren\u2019t doing their job or not committing to their country. \u201cYou can drill a player mentally and physically and it can cause extreme burnout, which no one wants to see. That is a reactive way of dealing with things and we want to be at the forefront of making it acceptable for people to say: \u2018I need to spend time with my family now and I\u2019m taking this tour off,\u2019 just because of the extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Despite forecasting withdrawals down the line, Morgan appears upbeat about the looming tour and, with it worth an estimated \u00a33.2m to Cricket South Africa in revenues, has stressed the need for countries to help each other out. Morgan added: \u201cThere is a huge amount of responsibility not only to get just your home country\u2019s fixtures under way but to facilitate other countries around the world and do what we can to try to get cricket back on. \u201cNot only does it mean a huge amount to people in lockdown in their own countries \u2013 in this case South Africa \u2013 but also for Cricket South Africa financially. I know the worry we had about potentially not bowling a ball all summer and the detrimental impact on grassroots cricket, so if the tour goes ahead we would love to be there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
