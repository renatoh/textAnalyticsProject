No doubt certain personalities, above and below the line, wind you up, but in the spirit of the season we invite you to say something positive about the other personalities that make up Cif. And here's a real challenge: how about giving a compliment to someone you generally disagree with? Perhaps you dislike the political philosophy underlying MoveAnyMountain's posts, but nevertheless respected his contributions enough to vote him commenter of the year in the recent Ciffies awards? Or perhaps one of our regular contributors is anathema to you, but surprised you by writing an article you agreed with. Was there something thought-provoking, compassionate, or just plain funny from an unexpected quarter? After all, if first world war soldiers could suspend hostilities for a friendly game of football at Christmas, a happy Cifmas shouldn't be impossible to achieve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
