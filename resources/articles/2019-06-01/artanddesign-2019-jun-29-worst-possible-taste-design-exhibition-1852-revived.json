Having then made a pot of tea to steady himself, Mr Crumpet noticed with pain the butterfly painted on the teacup he held to his lips. For he now knew that such embellishments, copied from the natural world, were also the height of bad taste. Mr Crumpet, of course, never actually existed. He was created by the writer Henry Morley in a piece commissioned by Charles Dickens to run in the December edition of the magazine Household Words. Dickens, the editor, was full of scorn for an exhibition which he felt sneered at the tastes of the common man. But for the cultural historian Sir Christopher Frayling, this provocative show about domestic tastes was a landmark in changing national attitudes \u2013 and especially the section of it the newspapers dubbed the \u201cchamber of horrors\u201d. Frayling is givinga talk about the show\u2019s curator, Henry Cole, and what he called his \u201cgallery of false principles\u201d. Whether or not this ever displayed a sample of Mr Crumpet\u2019s trouser material, or of his decorated crockery, it certainly did display 87 items judged in poor taste, including a gas fitting shaped like a convolvulus flower and some very ornate wallpaper. Frayling has now tracked down several of these original exhibits and is presenting his findings on Saturday at the current Great Exhibition Road Festival in Kensington, London. He argues that Cole was brave to be so candid about his set of aesthetic guidelines. \u201cHe was being honest really, since there always are rules at work in an exhibition and they are rarely set out and explained,\u201d said Frayling. \u201cIn this case they were to do with proportion, colour and geometry, as well as not taking things directly from nature. This was a genuine attempt to show the way.\u201d Curators at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which Cole later went on to found and run, helped Frayling uncover more of the items once described on placards as \u201cindefensible in principle\u201d. There was a bread tray bearing a biblical image of the feeding of the five thousand, a wallpaper featuring horses, a selection of virtuoso cut- glass engraving and that original convolvulus gas jet. \u201cI would love to show it all together again one day,\u201d Frayling said. \u201cWe know that Dickens went to the exhibition and thought it cruel because there is a classroom scene in his novel Hard Times in which a government inspector tells pupils they cannot design a wallpaper with \u2018orses on it\u2019.\u201d Cole\u2019s gallery of bad taste did not stay open for long because, not surprisingly, the manufacturers of the offending objects were upset. All the same, it marked a moment in which the idea of improving public taste was made explicit. \u201cWhen Cole set up his show in 1852 there was no Karl Marx and no Sigmund Freud, so there was no psychology nor class analysis. The idea was simply to raise the tone,\u201d said Frayling. \u201cOf course, now we think taste is all a question of where we are coming from. But for Cole there was a manifesto. He believed it was a branch of human science the public could study.\u201d Until then the French notion of \u201ctaste\u201d had been the preserve of scholars and aesthetes. Edmund Burke had tackled it in his 1756 Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, and then, a century later, the art theorist John Ruskin hoped to inspire the masses with the articles he wrote for The Artist and Amateur\u2019s Magazine, subtitled A Work Devoted to the Interests of the Arts of Design and the Cultivation of Taste. And discussions of taste continued to have the power to rattle people. When design critic Stephen Bayley staged a show on the theme at The Boilerhouse, a precursor of the Design Museum, in the 1980s, he placed the items he judged \u201cgood taste\u201d on pedestals and those in poor taste, such as the model of a postmodern house by architect Terry Farrell, on a dustbin. \u201cFarrell was cross,\u201d said Deyan Sudjic, director of London\u2019s Design Museum. \u201cHe ran in and took the model out. He felt traduced just as those in Cole\u2019s chamber of horrors had.\u201d Bayley\u2019s show and his book, Taste: The Secret Meaning of Things, were, however, deliberate attempts to shake up assumptions. \u201cTaste is a moveable feast,\u201d he said this weekend. \u201cI put on that show because people were not distinguishing taste from design. Design is largely a technical subject to do with whether something works well. But whether you actually like something is then a matter of your own taste.\u201d Bayley dates the modern appetite for clean lines and purity to the birth of mass production: \u201cModernist aesthetic principles came along in reaction to that moment when suddenly everyone became consumers. It was required as a kind of rationalisation. And people do crave order. So in that way modernism is like classicism. Personal taste remains a tricky issue. \u201cIt is a taboo. People are open about sexuality and money, but they are squeamish about their taste because the everyday choices we make are so revealing.\u201d The truth, Bayley holds, is that people with the same background usually share their tastes. Among his own chamber of horrors would be lava lamps, (\u201cnostalgic meretricious crap\u201d), and Philippe Starck\u2019s attention-seeking lemon squeezer, although he thinks Ikea\u2019s ubiquitous Billy bookcase is a \u201cclassic\u201d. Such domestic choices, often informed by nostalgia and aspiration, were the subject of artist Grayson Perry\u2019s huge 2012 tapestries The Vanity of Small Differences, and of his Bafta-winning television show All In the Best Possible Taste. This September the Turner Prize winner\u2019s new solo show at the Victoria Miro gallery in Mayfair, London, will include new work looking at the way consumer choices express our identity. Perry\u2019s ceramic pot Shopping for Meaning is covered with images of the artist in a wig and headscarf, standing in front of London\u2019s designer stores: all places that claim to sell good taste. \u201cThe great thing about Grayson is he has been able to talk about these differences without being condescending,\u201d said Sudjic. \u201cIt would be a terrible thing if a museum now was trying to teach good taste. We have stopped having that sense of moral certainty about it and are aware of how transient any rules are.\u201d A classical faith in the essential truth of beautiful objects, as set out in Keats\u2019s Ode on a Grecian Urn, is powerfully countered now, Sudjic suggests, by Laver\u2019s Law. This is the chart set out by fashion theorist James Laver that describes any new object\u2019s inevitable journey from being seen at first as outlandish, then chic, then dowdy, then hideous, then quaint, before being finally hailed as the epitome of bygone style. \u201cHumans are programmed to look for change and difference, and I hope we are exploring that at the Design Museum. People are really sophisticated now and so we want to look forward and make sense of what is going on,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
