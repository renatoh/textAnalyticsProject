The Russian has been provisionally banned but her legal team have said they intend to seek a suspension of less than a year. The medication, which Sharapova said she had legally taken throughout her career, was placed on the banned list by the World Anti-Doping Agency at the beginning of the year following \u201cevidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance\u201d. Sharapova said on Monday she did not realise the substance was illegal, but took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for her actions. She has since seen three major sponsors distance themselves from her, yet men\u2019s world No1 Novak Djokovic has given his support to Sharapova and said he hopes she \u201cgets out of this stronger\u201d. Sharapova, who has not appeared in public since her admission at a press conference on Monday, released a detailed statement on Facebook on Wednesday night where she insisted she is determined to play again. \u201cI woke up yesterday morning with an inbox, in full capacity of love and compassion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe first email I immediately opened was from my best friend, you know, the type of person who can make you smile and cry with only one word and who I spent the evening on the phone with, checking up on me, how was I doing? \u201cOn average, I love the mornings. New day, new start. It is fair to say that this day was not average. Nothing came to mind at 6am, except that I am determined to play tennis again and I hope I will have the chance to do so. I wish I didn\u2019t have to go through this, but I do \u2013 and I will. \u201cI needed to sweat, to push through and grind as I have done most of my life, so I made my way to the gym. That\u2019s when I realized a bunch of tinted windowed cars were following me. The good old paparazzi, back on the trail.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cI have not been online much except the odd search for a new antique coffee table (random, I know), but my friends made a collage for me with all your beautiful messages and hashtags that you created (#IStandWithMaria and #LetMariaPlay). I spent the afternoon reading them next to my dog, who couldn\u2019t quite understand why this was more important than the walk he was expecting to take. \u201cIn this moment, I am so proud to call you my fans. Within hours of my announcement, you showed me support and loyalty, which I could only expect to hear when someone would be at the top of their profession. \u201cI wanted to let you know that your wonderful words put a smile on my face. I\u2019d like to play again and hope to have the chance to do so. Your messages give me great encouragement. This message isn\u2019t anything else but to say thank you. Thank you very much.\u201d Meanwhile, following her victory over Galina Voskoboeva at Indian Wells, British No2 Heather Watson has admitted she had been shocked to hear about Sharapova\u2019s suspension \u201cI think I was scrolling through Twitter and it was there. I just saw it, read it and was interested,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very cautious. I don\u2019t like to take supplements so I don\u2019t that often. When we\u2019re travelling for example, like in China, you have to be careful with what you eat. \u201cWhen I am going to take something, I always get it tested first. I remember one year I got tested like 16 times, one week I had three tests in a row, this was the year I was coming back from mono, I guess they had me on high alert or something. I\u2019m tested all the time so I am always cautious, I would never want something to hurt my career like that.\u201d The two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova acknowledged that Sharapova had made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s something which we all should know what we\u2019re taking and know what we are putting into our body,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge mistake unfortunately. She takes the responsibility for it.\u201d But Djokovic was less willing to condemn the 28-year-old. \u201cI obviously wish her all the best,\u201d he told TMZ.com. \u201cI\u2019ve known her for a long time. I feel for her with all that\u2019s happening and I just hope she gets out of this stronger.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
