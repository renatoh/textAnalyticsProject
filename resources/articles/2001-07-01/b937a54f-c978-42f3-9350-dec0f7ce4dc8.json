Although prices last month were 6% lower than for June 2000, prices have actually risen 1% since the end of last year, the company's car price index showed. Alliance &amp; Leicester business strategy director Tim Pile said: \"This year the trend in new car prices has been slowly starting to turn upward.\" The survey comes just two days after EC statistics revealed that Britons are still paying far more for new cars than their European counterparts. Mr Pile added: \"Buyers should be more aware than ever of the need to haggle prices down and to compare UK prices with those offered by importers and car supermarkets.\" The 6% fall in June compared with a 7.9% fall in May compared with May 2000. The biggest fall in prices in June 2001 was in the small car category - down 12.3%. The price of one-year-old cars in June 2001 rose 5.8% compared with the same month last year, while the price of three-year-old cars rose 8.3%. Douglas McWilliams, of the centre for economics and business research - which independently verified the index - said: \"The index highlights a potentially worrying trend - new car prices are now beginning to rise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
