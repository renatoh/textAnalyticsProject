A beautiful song makes way for a restrained synth-led workout; it's a real tone-setter. The best track by my favourite new artist Wbeeza: Laying Here Hailing from Peckham, Wbeeza is one of the most refreshing and talented up-and-coming UK artists out there at the moment, fusing Detroit house sounds with south London influences. You can often catch him on the mic at Secretsundaze. The track that should have been a crossover hit Ossie: Set The Tone Another talented young newcomer from London. The poppy vocodered R&amp;B-esque vocals over lively UK funky-style drums should have been the perfect ingredients for a 2011 summer crossover. The track that got me out of bed this morning Ethyl &amp; Flori: Shelter A beautiful track with an enormously catchy yet meandering melody line from these two hugely talented young UK DJs and producers. Watch out for this dropping in the autumn, backed with a Rolando remix. The track that's been unfairly slept on this year Erik &amp; Fiedel: Rio Dope high-octane Detroit-meets-UK-funky workout from the label affiliated to Berlin's legendary Hard Wax record store. The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor Michoacan: 2 Bullets A killer hooky chorus that many people know and even those that don't will be humming it all the way home. Really hypnotic, too. The track that currently gets the most rewinds Underground Solution feat Colour Girl: Tears (Dreem Team Dub Mix) This classic UK garage track was all over the pirates in Nottingham when I was there at university in 1998. I wheeled it out at the recent Secretsundaze 10th birthday party and it was still sounding fresh. The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding Sharon Brown: Specialize In Love I often drop this at the end of night as a \"one more\". I rocked it as a closer track at the last time I played Lovebox in 2009 \u2013 pure vibes. The track I wish I'd never played Samim: Heater Although there are good things to be said about this record, it got very annoying very quickly. I remember playing it by mistake one time on the Canvas roof terrace, having meant to play the B-side. There's a YouTube video of the incident; I look particularly awkward. James plays Secretsundaze Closing Party, Village Underground, EC2, Sun; 10 Years Of Secretsundaze mixed by James Priestley &amp; Giles Smith is out now \u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2011 to correct the photo accreditation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
