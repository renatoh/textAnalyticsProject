He was lying second in the Safari Rally last night, 16 seconds behind Tommi Makinen's Subaru. There had been times when McRae greeted Makinen's turn of speed with a mixture of disquiet and disbelief, but the gap between the two never exceeded two minutes and as the Safari is not only much rougher, but three times as long as any other world championship rally, there was never cause for alarm; his Ford gave no trouble aside from one broken rear shock absorber. \"It's been going according to plan. Two minutes here isn't two seconds on any other rally, but it's nowhere near the same. We weren't going exceptionally quickly, but you've got to be so careful. You can push harder, but you can so easily break the car,\" McRae said. Makinen denied he had been chancing his arm and was irritated to have surrendered a useful advantage on the last of yesterday's four sections, as his team had not told him of McRae's progress on the radio. \"Unfortunately, we lost a good lead. We have to push again tomorrow. We could go so much faster easily. In my opinion, it is not too hard for the car,\" Makinen said. Richard Burns's reputation as a Safari expert has taken a battering, along with his Peugeot. The world champion is in eighth place, while Armin Schwarz made a spectacular start in his Hyundai but is outside the top ten."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
