Only Greece, Ireland and Italy charge more than Britain, where the average cost of transferring \u20ac100 (\u00a363) to another European country is \u00a318, the report said. UK bank transfers can take up to 34 days to arrive, compared with a maximum of just four days in France and Ireland. The commission said it was deeply disappointed with the findings, which showed that the average cost of transferring money from country to country within the EU has not fallen at all in the last eight years. \"The survey clearly shows that in far too many cases customers are not receiving the information on charges to which they are entitled... and there is still too much unauthorised double charging,\" said EU commissioner Frits Bolkestein. \"If you're paying up to a third of your transfer in bank charges that is clearly excessive,\" another official added. The survey was based on a sample of 1,480 cross-border bank transfers in the EU in March and showed that the average cost of transferring \u20ac100 across Europe was \u00a315.25. The UK was also one of only two countries (with Germany) where a money transfer had gone missing and still not been recovered. Bank transfers from the UK could take as little as one day, the commission said but the average time was 4.19 days and in exceptional circumstances a transfer could take 34 days, a figure worse only in Italy where they could take 43 days. Ranked by country the UK is the fourth most expensive in the 15-nation EU for transferring money abroad. According to Brussels the loss of foreign currency in such a transaction is, at 79p, the highest in the EU. The findings are surprising in light of recent technological developments and show that transfer costs in the 12 eurozone countries are also high. Banks said they had taken action to address the problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
