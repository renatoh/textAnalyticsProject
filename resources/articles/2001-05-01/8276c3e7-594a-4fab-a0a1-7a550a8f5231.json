Even when the performance is hit and miss - as it was on this occasion - Purcell's sequence of masques, written for insertion into a ramshackle adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream, still retains its extraordinary magic. It weaves a spell at once fantastic and humane, optimistic yet, at times, piercingly poignant. The members of EBF have always been pioneering authenticists, aiming to recreate not just period musicianship but Baroque theatrical practice. Jonathan Cocker's production replaces most of the dialogue with spoken narration, but elsewhere it aspires to get as close as possible to the look, feel and style of the first production of 1692. Inigo Jones was the original designer and his striking costumes have been reconstructed with a certain gaudy brilliance. There are some gentle political digs: Oberon and Titania look like an idealised William and Mary; Phoebus pays them homage got up like Louis XIV in Roi Soleil kit. Stephen Preston's choreography, elegant if earth-bound, combines courtly fastidiousness with bucolic whimsy. The principal flaw lies, however, in an absence of panache. The word \"baroque\" is synonymous in English with vaunting extravagance, and whether you stage The Fairy Queen as period theatre or modern fantasy (like David Pountney's controversial English National Opera production), it needs flamboyance as well as tenderness. Here a certain staid self-consciousness reigns. The characters amble on and off when they should strut like peacocks in Jones's fabulous plumage. Despite Cocker's emotional insights - tensions still simmer between the feuding lovers, for instance, even when Oberon's magic has supposedly resolved the discord - an element of coyness replaces Purcell's sexual knowingness. A similar dampener hangs over the music. The singers are variable, though the best of them - countertenor Tobias Cole, soprano Yvonne Barclay and the outstanding bass Graeme Broadbent - are excellent. In the pit, however, Howard Williams approaches the score with tentative caution. Some of the playing is ropy, though this is less worrying than the reverential solemnity that all too frequently takes the place of what should be ebullience in this wonderful score. \u0095 Until Saturday.
