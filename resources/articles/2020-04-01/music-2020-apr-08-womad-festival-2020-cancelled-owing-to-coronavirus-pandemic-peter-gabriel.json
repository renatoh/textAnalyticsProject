Co-founder Peter Gabriel said its organisers had been \u201choping, waiting and watching\u201d the situation to see if the event could proceed in July. Following government advice and a meeting with the local licensing authority, organisers decided to cancel the festival. \u201cSafety for all of our festival-goers, artists and our staff surpassed everything,\u201d said Gabriel. Musicians including the Flaming Lips, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Fatoumata Diawara, Kate Tempest and Les Amazones d\u2019Afrique were due to perform at this year\u2019s Womad in Charlton Park, Wiltshire. Gabriel said many of the artists billed to appear had agreed to play the 2021 edition of the festival and that more information would be announced in due course. \u201cWe hope to see you all at Charlton Park next year for a big celebration, when we\u2019ve put this meanie back in the bottle,\u201d he said. Tickets for the 2020 festival are automatically valid for the 2021 festival, which will take place from 22-25 July. Ticket holders are also eligible for refunds. Womad is the latest major UK festival to cancel its 2020 plans owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, Glastonbury announced that it would postpone its 50th anniversary celebrations until 2021. Other cancelled events include London\u2019s All Points East, the rock festival Download and the Isle of Wight festival. Yet many festivals remain on the calendar. British Summer Time Hyde Park has announced that the future of its planned events in London this July \u2013 including headline performances by Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar \u2013 remains under consultation. Reading and Leeds festivals, due to take place over the August bank holiday weekend, are also billed to proceed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
