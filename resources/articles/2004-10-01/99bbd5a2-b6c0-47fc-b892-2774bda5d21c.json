Over the past decade, it has become one of the country's most popular pastimes, with at least one million people attempting to search the 1901 Census within an hour of it being made available on the internet. But this weekend, on the eve of a new BBC series that sets out to investigate the family trees of 10 celebrity volunteers, experts have warned there are dangers associated with this apparently harmless obsession. Family research can often turn up surprising and even unwelcome truths. Two of the celebrities who take part in the BBC series, comedians Meera Syal and Vic Reeves, both have reason to agree with this cautionary message. While Syal was deeply moved to discover that one of her grandfathers had been imprisoned and tortured in India for his resistance to British rule, Reeves has come across an even more complicated family secret. His grandfather, it transpired, was a bigamist. 'People really have to think hard about what they want to gain from the process,' said Nick Barratt, a family history researcher and a consultant on the Who Do You Think You Are? series. 'You never know what you are going to uncover. Sometimes things come to light that call into question someone's whole parentage.' Barratt, of the Rich Sticks research company, believes there are two key motivations for tracing the lives of your ancestors. 'Some people do it because they are looking for a context for their own lives and others do it because they are interested in the history itself,' he said. For Syal, who discovered rebellious ancestry on both sides of her family, the research was the fulfilment of a long-held wish. 'I had wanted to do it for quite a while,' said the TV star and writer, who is filming a new series of the BBC2 sitcom The Kumars at Number 42. 'I have always felt there was something missing, but it is not an easy thing doing research like that in India.' Syal flew out to the Punjab, the original home of both her parents, with a camera crew. She discovered that her parents grew up in villages that are only a small distance apart, although they eventually met in Delhi. Her mother was Sikh and her father Hindu. 'Seeing my ancestral villages was very important. My family homes are in ruins, though, because everyone has left these small villages.' The discovery that not one but both of her grandfathers were involved in the struggle for Indian independence was of key significance. 'It turned out they were both freedom fighters and this explained a lot to me,' Syal said. 'One was a communist journalist who was active in trade unions and the other actually took part in some of the violent marches and was imprisoned and tortured. I found his name mentioned inside the Golden Temple as a Punjabi Martyr, which was amazing.' Syal's mother had heard the name of the prison used as a child, but she had not understood. 'There is a kind of cartharsis when these things are explained. Family dynamics are often coroded by secrets,' Syal said. 'I had often wondered if I had any rebellious roots, because in a way it had always been a bit like that for me,' she said. 'My life would have been so much easier if I had simply married a pharmacist and lived in Wolverhampton. And now it turns out that both my grandfathers were odd-ones-out, too. One of them was the only young man who left his village, for example.' The discoveries were also 'humbling', according to Syal. 'There were so many occasions when they were both in danger, it makes you realise that you are only here yourself because of several bizarre twists of fate. It also made me realise that there is nothing that can compare in our lives now with the kind of risks they took.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
