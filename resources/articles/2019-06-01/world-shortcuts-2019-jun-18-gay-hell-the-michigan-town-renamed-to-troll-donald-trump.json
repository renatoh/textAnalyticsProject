Depends on what? That\u2019s quite a difference. Whether we\u2019re talking about Hell (178 years) or Gay Hell (one day). Gay Hell, I think \u2013 that\u2019s what it says at the top of the page. But surely plain old hell has been around for longer than 178 years? No, it\u2019s not hell, as in where bad dudes go after death for eternal punishment and suffering; we\u2019re talking about Hell, a tiny town in Michigan. How tiny? Population: about 70. So it was formerly called Hell, but now it\u2019s called Gay Hell? Yep. Because? Because Elijah Daniel \u2013 The 25-year-old YouTube vlogger and joker? Obviously, yes, that Elijah Daniel. He bought Hell and changed the name to Gay Hell. Any reason? To protest against the ban on rainbow flags at US embassies during Pride month, instituted by Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cI bought the whole town,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI have renamed my town to Gay Hell, MI. The only flags allowed to fly are pride.\u201d He later dialled back in an NBC News interview, saying it was a joke and he wouldn\u2019t ban other flags. Does Daniel have a connection with Hell? He was born into an evangelical Christian family in Detroit, which isn\u2019t far away. And he used to be the mayor of Hell, in 2017. For a day. How come? You can pay $100 (\u00a380) to become the mayor of Hell for a day. Daniel did it in response to Trump\u2019s travel restrictions from some Muslim countries. Then what happened? He got impeached. What! Shouldn\u2019t this be more like front page news than Pass notes? Daniel, not Trump. It\u2019s what happens when your day is up. Any policies while he was mayor? He banned heterosexuality. But not in a bad way. \u201cI love straights, but my #1 priority is the safety of my town,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cUntil the heterosexual threat has been reviewed we cannot allow them to enter.\u201d And how much did he pay to buy Hell? He\u2019s not saying. But the two-hectare (five-acre) commercial property was on the market for $900,000 in 2016. Peanuts to a YouTuber, I imagine. There\u2019s also a question mark over whether technically he owns it outright. Who cares, it\u2019s Gay Hell now. And hundred of thousands of 18- to 24-year-olds are aware of a political story that they might otherwise not have been. Do say: \u201cAn intelligent hell would be better than a stupid paradise\u201d \u2013 Victor Hugo. Don\u2019t say: \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell, keep going\u201d \u2013 Winston Churchill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
