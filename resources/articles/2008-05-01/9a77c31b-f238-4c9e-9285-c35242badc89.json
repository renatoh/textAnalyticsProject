Vidic wants to win every ball and Ferdinand always looks to pass every ball out of defence and create something\" 9/10 Tony Mowbray \"Vidic is an aggressive bulldog who enjoys playing in a confrontational manner. Ferdinand is more than capable of doing the same but although he is actually the more authoritative individual, Rio prefers to use his talent to pass the ball out of defence\" 9/10 Connectivity GS \"Despite Gary Neville's long absence United's defence has had more of a settled look this season and there is perhaps more understanding between the back five than at Chelsea\" 9/10 TM \"It is wonderful to watch the way United can switch from defensive compactness to an open attacking style in an instant. That reflects great understanding and near telepathy throughout the whole team. Ferdinand's passing quality is integral to this\" 9/10 Heading GS \"Like Terry, Vidic relishes attacking balls in the air but while Rio has the right physique and can certainly head a ball it is neither his favourite part of the game nor the strongest aspect of it\" 8/10 TM \"Ferdinand has the ideal size and physique for aerial combat but, although he can head well, like Carvalho it is not his natural game and he prefers to avoid putting himself in situations where he might be forced to fight in the air. Vidic, though, loves aerial battles\" 8/10 Tackling GS \"Like Terry, Vidic is naturally much more a \"take 'em out\" type of player but Ferdinand relies much more on his reading of the game to avoid having to make tackles in the first place. Like Carvalho he gets very tight on forwards\" 9/10 TM \"Vidic has the greater tackling ability and relishes the art but Ferdinand's vision and knowledge of the game is so good that he rarely needs to make a tackle and is much more about interceptions\" 9/10 Distribution GS \"Ferdinand gives United the advantage here. He can dribble his way out of tight spots and is a really good passer who usually picks the right one. Vidic tends to keep it simple but he rarely wastes possession\" 9/10 TM \"Vidic plays the simple pass well. Ferdinand loves to step out of defence in possession and when doing so Vidic offers him such excellent cover\" 9/10 Total: 88/100 Chelsea: Ricardo Carvalho and John Terry Understanding GS \"Terry and Carvalho have played together for longer and they complement each other very well; Carvalho marks people very tightly while Terry is traditionally English and wants to challenge for every ball\" 9/10 TM \"Terry's strength and robustness mean that his quality on the ball can get overlooked. Carvalho's game relies on using space well and stepping in front of people. He's not huge but his biggest strength is his brainpower\" 9/10 Connectivity GS \"Chelsea's connectivity this season has been disrupted by Petr Cech suffering an injury and the full-backs having regularly been switched around but Terry is a great communicator\" 8\u00bd/10 TM \"Very good. Carvalho knows how to wait to pick the right pass while Terry is a great organiser with the knack of placing his clearances for team-mates to collect comfortably. They combine well with the holding midfield player, especially when the full-backs attack\" 9/10 Heading GS \"Although Carvalho is a bit shorter than Rio he seems to enjoy heading a bit more and Terry is not only built to attack aerial balls but loves doing so\" 9/10 TM \"Carvalho has come from a culture where heading ability is not a prerequisite for centre-halves but you wouldn't realise that it is not his natural game. To succeed in England as a centre-half you have to be able to head and he has shown he can do it. Terry is totally commanding in the air\" 9/10 Tackling GS \"Carvalho's game is all about getting very tight on people whereas Terry is more about taking them out when possible. They both have different skills and combine superbly\" 9/10 TM \"Tackling is a dying art these days and, in any case, if you have great players with the ability to read the game they don't need to tackle that much unless isolated one on one. Terry enjoys tackling but Carvalho prefers interceptions and stepping in front of people\" 9/10 Distribution GS \"Carvalho brings the ball forward more than Terry but John is more careful in possession than he is sometimes given credit for. But this is one sphere where United have the edge\" 8/10 TM \"If Carvalho can't spot the right pass he'll keep going forward until he sees it. Terry rarely simply blasts the ball clear and will find a colleague who is not under intense pressure\" 9/10 Total: 88\u00bd/100"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
