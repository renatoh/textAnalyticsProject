It warned that, because Montpellier was both on red alert for a heatwave and rated as a \u201csevere\u201d wildfire risk, special measures had been put in place at the zoo. The city, in the H\u00e9rault department of the Occitanie region of the south of France, is baking hot. It was confirmed on Saturday that temperatures reached a record high for the country of 45.9C on Friday in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a nearby village. The weather service said that was comparable to August temperatures in California\u2019s Death Valley. M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France lifted its red warning on Saturday but forecast a \u201cvery hot day\u201d across a large central band of the country. Seven hundred firefighters battled wildfires in the Gard \u2013 in some areas the fires had closed sections of the motorway. Fifteen firefighters were hurt but no serious injuries were reported, although in the neighbouring region of Vaucluse, a cyclist died after collapsing in the heat while riding in the mountains. His was the sixth heat-related death in the sweltering weather covering much of western Europe. Three people died as a result of the heat in Italy, where Milan was hit by power cuts caused by the demand for air conditioning. For a fourth consecutive day, in Spain, temperatures rose above 43C on Saturday, causing two people to die from heat-related complications. Forty of Spain\u2019s 50 regions were placed under weather alert, with seven of them considered to be at extreme risk, the national meteorological agency said. Firefighters managed to contain 90% of the wildfires that raged across 60 square kilometres in the northeastern Tarragona province, the Catalan government said, but two other wildfires in the central Toledo region were still burning. At Montpellier zoo, Gomel wasn\u2019t worried so much for the animals as for the visitors. On Thursday, three children on a school trip from the nearby town of Arles were taken to hospital suffering from heat exhaustion. \u201cI don\u2019t think their supervisors were being very sensible,\u201d said Gomel. \u201cApparently they were letting them run around everywhere.\u201d He was taking no chances this weekend. Fire trucks were trundling around, soaking the pathways with water. Parts of the park with steep inclines were off-limits: no lions or bears today. The zoo\u2019s current star attraction \u2013 the cheetahs, who gave birth last November \u2013 were showing how it\u2019s done, lying like lean, furry chaise-longues in the shadows. France remains chastened by the memory of the 2003 heatwave, in which an estimated 15,000 people died. Not this time, said the health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, who was visiting Car\u00e9meau hospital in N\u00eemes. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that no one will die, but we\u2019ve put everything in place to ensure it\u2019s the lowest number possible. Compared with 2003, we\u2019re extremely well prepared \u2013 especially with respect to the elderly, especially those isolated at home.\u201d The preparations seemed to be working this weekend. The inpatient hall was quiet; there were more security guards for the ministerial visit outside. \u201cThey\u2019ve put in a lot of preventative measures in advance this time,\u201d said Xavier Faure, who works with the regional health agency. Canicule, or heatwave, warnings were ubiquitous last week. The end-of-day statistics at Car\u00e9meau hospital on Friday seemed to justify the approach: only seven people were admitted to casualty for heat-related reasons, one in cardiac arrest; an 8% to 10% increase in call activity. Over in N\u00eemes, no one was walking on the limestone esplanade outside the arena walls; the fake centurion union had obviously given everyone the day off. A hot wind, which felt like it bypassed the eyelids to begin desiccating the corneas directly, licked the streets. A few hundred metres away at a refreshment point \u2013 one of three set up by the city \u2013 offering bottled water and a place for a breather in the Maison Carr\u00e9e arts centre, Alina Richard echoed the good news from the hospital; she had only had to serve one person in real distress. She offered lunch advice to a student. \u201cYou should eat something fresh and cooling,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a salade Ni\u00e7oise!\u201d he offered, beaming. Even the Jardin de la Fontaine, with its ornamental canals, offered little respite. Dust swirled off the ground where a group of locals were playing p\u00e9tanque. Patric, a retired N\u00eemois lorry driver, shrugged off the pressure cooker atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing \u2013 we\u2019re used to it. You\u2019ve just got to let it pass,\u201d he said. But Baptiste, a psychology student from Bordeaux who was dousing himself at a water fountain, was fearful about the future: \u201cWe already have an unstable economy \u2013 can you imagine adding regular droughts to that too?\u201d Back down by the arena, Thierry, a roadie working for an events company, thought there may be a lesson for National Rally-voting N\u00eemes. \u201cIt\u2019s the degree or two extra that makes doing this tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sub-Saharan African has nothing \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to work in conditions like this. People here should go and work there. It\u2019d be an education for some people.\u201d The World Meteorological Organisation said last week that 2019 was on track to being one of the hottest years globally, and 2015 to 2019 would then be the hottest five-year period on record. It said the European heatwave was \u201cabsolutely consistent\u201d with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Back at the water fountain in N\u00eemes, the psychology student contemplated the possibility of record temperatures being beaten regularly in the years ahead. \u201cHave you seen the film Interstellar?\u201d he said. \u201cThe Earth isn\u2019t going to die all of a sudden. It\u2019ll be a slow, sad decline.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
