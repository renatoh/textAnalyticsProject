Our guest, teacher and filmmaker Alom Shaha, expresses his passion for the subject. He has been spreading the gospel of science through his website whyscience.co.uk where a host of fellow educators and scientists explain on camera why they think science is important. In a recent blog on our site, Alom revealed why he decided to make a film that would help science teachers persuade their pupils to sit up and take notice. In the podcast, he tells us what he thinks about the way science is currently taught. We also speak to a doctor who climbs Mount Everest in the name of medicine.
