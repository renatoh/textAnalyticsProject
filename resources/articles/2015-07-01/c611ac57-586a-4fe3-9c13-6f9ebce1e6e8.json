Visitors to Bristol\u2019s Temple Church might encounter a choir at teatime, performance poetry at 10pm, a drum and pipe band at 8am, popstars at noon or readings in the depths of night. The idea, Gates says, is that there will be continuous sound for 576 hours. That sound will be produced by a diverse array of Bristol performers. \u201cThe hope is that Bristol will hear itself,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt could be a platform for protest, but it could also be a place of deep reflection or celebration or mourning. Sound allows emotion to do really cool things.\u201d The project, which will launch on 29 October, is called Sanctum. Produced by the arts commissioning group Situations, which was behind the burial of gold on Folkestone beach by the artist Michael Sailstorfer last year, Sanctum is among the events and initiatives marking Bristol\u2019s year as European green capital. Attracting one of the most sought-after artists in the world is something of a coup for Bristol. ArtReview placed Gates 44th in its most recent Power 100, calling him \u201cthe poster boy for socially engaged art\u201d. He is best known for his arts and urban renewal projects on the South Side of Chicago, his home city, and this year won the biennial Artes Mundi contemporary art prize, sharing the prize money with other shortlisted artists. Situations director Claire Doherty travelled to Chicago to persuade Gates face to face. \u201cI actually sat on his front step and waited for him to come back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a fantastic conversation about what he had achieved in Chicago and where he saw his art practice going. He was getting a lot of invitations to regenerate cities, but what we really connected on is [that] he can\u2019t just parachute in to various locations and do what he has done in Chicago.\u201d The Bristol project will involve hundreds of performers from all kinds of disciplines, together sustaining a sound or voice for 576 hours continuously. Organisers will announce exactly who is taking part in September, but visitors will not know who is on when. \u201cWhen you go in, you won\u2019t know who is going to play,\u201d said Doherty. \u201cIt levels the performance and means it is very much the city speaking rather than a gig.\u201d There will be opportunities to reserve a place in the audience, which will number around 40-50 people and queues are anticipated at peak times. A good number of performers have already been recruited and Doherty said the response had been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cOnce you start to ask people, they say, \u2018Oh, you must try \u2026\u2019 It is creating a network across the city.\u201d She said the common reaction to a environmental project commission was to explore recycling. \u201cTheaster\u2019s work goes deeper. He asks, \u2018What do we value about what we have in our cities? Can we make something from we have here, right now?\u2019 It is a project made for Bristol, with Bristol.\u201d Gates was captivated by Temple Church, a late medieval building bombed in 1940 leaving just exterior ruins, which are now looked after by English Heritage. \u201cWhen I visited Bristol and was looking at sites, I was just really moved by the ruins,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no initial idea except that the space, even in its current state, should be activated \u2026 there was still something extremely resonant there. Buildings fall down, times change and people\u2019s understanding of the sacred and secular world might be in constant flux \u2026 Sound has the capacity to make people feel things.\u201d The artist transforms buildings and materials that have been deemed worthless into places and things that have worth. In Bristol, he has gathered materials from other derelict sites across the city with which he will build a structure inside the church. News of the project coincides with the announcement of the first monograph on Gates. Phaidon will publish a book collating all his significant projects including 12 Ballads for the Huguenot House, when he turned a historic house in Kassel into a performance venue. Gates is much in demand. \u201cThe more that I say that I can\u2019t replicate Chicago, it doesn\u2019t mean there is no work to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just means that every city has so much of its own personality. I have to first ask myself: is there a way I can get to know the personality of a place through its people and places? \u201cI have to be careful in my engagements, but with Bristol, I don\u2019t know, there is something about its complicated history, its waters, its sacred sites, its working class, its openness, its scale. Sometimes things can happen in places like Bristol that can\u2019t happen in larger, cosmopolitan cities \u2026 great things can happen. I hope we\u2019ll make real magic for the 24 days.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
