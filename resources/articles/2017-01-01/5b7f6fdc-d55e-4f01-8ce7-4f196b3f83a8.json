The Chelsea manager said Costa\u2019s absence from the team last weekend was owing to a back injury and refused to even acknowledge the striker had been in conflict with the club over a multimillion-pound offer from a Chinese Super League club. \u201cDiego is available for the game against Hull,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cHe trained on Tuesday with the rest of the team and he trained very well. He has a good fitness. The pain in his back has gone, he has no pain in his back. For these reasons he is available for the game.\u201d Regarding Costa\u2019s future, Conte said: \u201cI think the player wants to stay at Chelsea. He is very happy to play with us and this idea [of a move to China] is far from his mind. He is happy to stay here, happy to play with us and this is the most important thing for us.\u201d Asked whether Chelsea might attempt to offer Costa a new contract, Conte replied: \u201cIt\u2019s important to have the four months in a very strong way and then we\u2019ll see. Now, it\u2019s important to be focused on the present.\u201d Conte said he had yet to make a decision on whether to recall Costa to his starting XI for Sunday\u2019s Premier League game at home to Hull. Chelsea eased to a 3-0 win over the champions Leicester City last week in Costa\u2019s absence and Conte said he faced a difficult choice. If he did select the striker Conte said he would be able to \u201cput his hands in the fire\u201d, an Italian phrase meaning he would be 100% sure of the player\u2019s dedication. \u201cFor me to make a decision is not easy\u201d, he said. \u201cI have four, five players who are very strong in that position \u2013 Willian, Pedro, Eden Hazard, Costa and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. They are in good form and they give me different options. \u201cFor sure I sleep a few hours less to make the best decision but this is my task: to pick the best players game by game. For this reason it is important to know if one player stays out it is not for punishment. It is only because I like to make the choice game by game but also to consider the opponent. \u201cI think that every time Diego has played for Chelsea, he has always put all of himself out there for this club, for this shirt. For this reason I am sure that on Sunday if Diego starts the game he will put all of himself in the shirt for the fans and to win the game. I can put my hands in the fire.\u201d Conte also defended Jorge Mendes, Costa\u2019s representative, who was recently photographed with the president of Tianjin Quanjian, the Chinese club believed to be behind the bid for the 28-year-old. \u201cI know Jorge and he\u2019s a friend,\u201d Conte said. \u201cI have never heard Jorge talk about Diego or talk about a transfer for Diego. For this reason I think he has great respect for us and in this situation I think he acted with great respect.\u201d Conte said Chelsea were evaluating an offer, believed to be from Bournemouth, for their reserve goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. \u201cThere is one offer,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been rejected \u2013 me and the club are trying to find the right solution. We are evaluating it but the club and the player both know my position. Asmir is a very important player for the club. He is an important player for me on and off the pitch and he knows this.\u201d The club captain, John Terry, is available to face Hull following his suspension after being sent off against Peterborough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
