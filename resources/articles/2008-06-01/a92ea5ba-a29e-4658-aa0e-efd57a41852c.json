Perhaps best known as a concert singer, he was equally at home with Bach - as a forthright Jesus in the Passions - Handel, Elgar, Britten, Delius, Tippett and Vaughan Williams. When he was a soloist in Tippett's The Vision of St Augustine with the BBC Singers, I recall how happy they were - their former colleague's voice was so clear they could find their notes easily. John was born in Southampton. His father was a gardener, and there was little spare money. His love of music and performance began at Godalming grammar school, Surrey, and he gained a scholarship to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he graduated in geography. While there, he studied singing with Clive Carey, a fine baritone himself, and George Guest arranged for him to join the choir of St John's College for a postgraduate year. In 1954, John took the title role in Dennis Arundell's production of Ralph Vaughan Williams's Pilgrim's Progress at the city's Guildhall. He found that the composer, who had not been completely happy with the 1951 Covent Garden production, was thrilled by this new one. \"This is what I meant,\" he said. His wife Ursula later wrote: \"John Noble, besides a fine voice, has a touching and dedicated dignity as the pilgrim.\" So it was apt that in 1970 he was asked to sing the role again in the EMI recording with his favourite conductor, Sir Adrian Boult. That recording is still the benchmark. A year of teaching geography followed university, but then John joined the BBC Singers, and he went on to make a good living from solo engagements, supplemented by recordings with the Ambrosian Singers. His operatic work included the massive title role in Alan Bush's Wat Tyler at Sadlers Wells, London (1974), and a wonderfully observed vicar in Britten's Albert Herring for the English Opera Group, conducted by the composer and subsequently recorded by Decca (1964). This was one of many successful recordings, and John made more than 200 broadcasts for the BBC. The conductor Meredith Davies invited him to join the staff of Trinity College of Music, London. He later taught at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, and had a thriving teaching practice for the rest of his life. At 6ft 6in, with an apparently serious demeanour, he was full of good humour and much loved by colleagues. Once, when he sat down after an aria in Handel's Messiah, his chair collapsed, and he fell back rather violently. Though unhurt, he caused great amusement by trying to repair it. I don't think he ever realised how difficult he made it for the other soloists to sing after this. When we were working together he used to offer me a lift in his large Rover (needed for his long legs). A very careful driver, when approaching a roundabout he would move to the left and slow down considerably some 300 yards in advance. I would then note all the cars we had overtaken in the last quarter of an hour passing us by. For two decades he was elected to the council of British Equity by soloists and chorus singers, a duty that he carried out with his usual patience and dedication, despite the bureaucracy. His fine voice was unchanged by age, and until his illness he continued to give recitals all over the UK with the soprano Angela Jenkins. He is survived by his wife Jean and their son and daughter. \u00b7 John Noble, baritone, born January 2 1931; died March 21 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
