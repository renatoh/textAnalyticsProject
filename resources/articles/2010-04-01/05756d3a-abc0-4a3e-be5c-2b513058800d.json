Here, on a night when fighting spirit was a prerequisite for a team in trouble, was the embodiment of Premier League surrender. Life without Fernando Torres is a prospect too awful for Liverpool to contemplate in the long term but, in the short, and against opponents as accommodating as Gianfranco Zola's relegation-threatened side, they cruised to victory to keep alive their outside chances of Champions League qualification. \"It will be difficult because Tottenhan have done their job and won two matches you normally would not expect,\" admitted the Liverpool manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \"But we have to keep going in case they make a mistake.\" A crowd of 37,697 was Liverpool's lowest in the league since December 2004 and a reflection of their diminishing prospects of a top-four finish. But they could not have wished for a more comfortable ride to take them within five points of Spurs, or better preparation for Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, than this triumph without breaking sweat. Across Stanley Park two weeks ago a spirited draw with Everton ended a run of six successive defeats and lifted the pressure on Zola and West Ham. Victory over Sunderland then increased the flow of confidence at a critical moment but, despite an encouraging start by the visitors, momentum was relinquished cheaply on their return to Merseyside and heads dropped the second Yossi Benayoun chested Liverpool ahead. West Ham's meagre response bore all the hallmarks of a side accepting defeat and reserving their energy for Saturday's relegation dogfight against Wigan Athletic. As did Zola's post-match analysis. The Italian, who is expected to part company with West Ham at the end of the season, said: \"We started very well but the first goal changed things completely. I don't think we felt we could come back from that. It hasn't been our best performance but this is not a moment to think about that too much. We have a massive game on Saturday and we need a reaction against Wigan. When I went into the dressing room afterwards I wanted to get a reaction but I didn't need to say anything because the players admitted they made mistakes. I am sure we will get a reaction.\" Liverpool began tentatively, befitting a side who failed to score against Fulham on their last Anfield outing and one trying to rediscover their potency without their one world-class striker for the rest of this trying season. Thanks to frequent lapses in the West Ham defence, however, the home side were able to assume complete control without having to raise their performance to any exalted heights. The pivotal moment was breathtaking in its simplicity as Benayoun responded to the constant jeers from his former supporters in the most emphatic manner available. Steven Gerrard whipped over a low free-kick from the right, awarded after a needless foul by Jonathan Spector on David Ngog, and the Israel captain somehow found himself completely unmarked in front of goal and able to steer the ball beyond Robert Green with his chest. Benayoun's body shape suggested he might have used an arm to score off the inside of the post but West Ham's appeals were muted and replays vindicated the officials' decision to allow the goal. Liverpool doubled their lead through Ngog, the young French striker who suffers by comparison with Torres but whom Zola had correctly identified as a genuine threat with his movement around the box. Benayoun was again central to the goal, picking out Maxi Rodr\u00edguez wide on the right, and, when the Argentina winger crossed low, Ngog reacted far quicker than Matthew Upson to sweep a fine finish through Green's suspect defences. It was a goal to worry Fabio Capello as well as his compatriot in the West Ham dug-out. Liverpool eased further ahead courtesy of another Gerrard free-kick. This time the captain's deep delivery from the left found Sotirios Kyrgiakos receiving scant attention from Upson at the back post. The Greece defender stretched to divert the ball against the post and the rebound struck Green on the leg before rolling over the line. The stroll was complete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
