In a further toughening of her stance, Sturgeon said she would offer SNP support to a Labour minority government only if it accepted the principle that it is for Holyrood to decide the timing of the second referendum. Asked if she could be definitive that her party would vote down a Labour budget if Corbyn refused the section 30 order needed by Holyrood to organise a vote next year, Sturgeon told the Guardian: \u201cThe principle is that the fact of and the timing of an independence referendum should be for the Scottish parliament, elected by the Scottish people, to decide. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe, if you have the potential for a minority Labour government, they are going to turn their back on the ability to govern over the question of a year.\u201d Pressed on whether voters should believe that the SNP would scupper a minority Labour administration similarly over the issue of one year, the first minister replied: \u201cThe SNP under my leadership would not ever, in any circumstances, vote for a Conservative Queen\u2019s speech or budget. \u201cWe will be offering support to a minority Labour government. We\u2019re simply saying that principle should be respected.\u201d Sturgeon and Corbyn clashed bitterly on this question earlier in the campaign, with Corbyn rejecting Sturgeon\u2019s offer of a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d to defeat Boris Johnson and accusing her of being willing to usher in \u201canother heartless Conservative government\u201d. But in recent weeks Labour has revealed itself to be increasingly open to the prospect of a second independence referendum in 2021 if Scotland returns a pro-independence majority in that year\u2019s Holyrood elections. Next year is already a busy one for Scotland, with the potential for another EU referendum and preparations for the Holyrood election campaign. The former SNP leader Alex Salmond\u2019s trial for a series of alleged sexual assaults is set for March, and Glasgow will host a UN climate conference in November. Would an independence campaign get the focus it merits? Dismissing the Salmond trial as \u201cirrelevant in this context\u201d, Sturgeon replied: \u201cIf you take the future of the UK in the European Union, the whole climate change issue, these are all relevant in terms of Scotland\u2019s ability to shape its own future. \u201cI think it\u2019s important if we are to allow ourselves to have the maximum potential to shape our own future, as opposed to have it shaped for us, that we have the ability to do so on that timescale.\u201d In contrast to Corbyn, Boris Johnson has pledged to deny the Scottish government a section 30 order under any circumstances. Holyrood\u2019s constitutional relations secretary, Michael Russell, hinted earlier in the election campaign that the Scottish government could resort to legal action in that case. Sturgeon refused to elaborate, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll consider all the options but I\u2019m not going to get into the detail of that right now. People have got the right over the next few days of having the focus being on do we want Boris Johnson to be in the position of calling these shots or don\u2019t we?\u201d Speaking to the Guardian from the SNP\u2019s yellow election battlebus, Sturgeon said: \u201cPersonally I\u2019ve found this to be quite a happy and warm campaign, even though it\u2019s been bloody freezing outside.\u201d One of the SNP\u2019s central messages has been about \u201clocking the Tories out of Downing Street\u201d. However, polling suggests the main SNP gains will be from Labour, which is predicted to lose all but one of its six Scottish seats. Asked whether this represented a failure of strategy, Sturgeon said: \u201cPolls don\u2019t decide elections and nothing is inevitable. For as long as there is time left to make the argument, I\u2019ll make the argument that Scotland should play its part in locking the Tories out of government. And the SNP is the best place to try and do that.\u201d Despite gloomy predictions during the summer about the impact on the Scottish Tories\u2019 fortunes of the departure of their leader Ruth Davidson and Johnson becoming head of the UK party, their support does not appear to have dipped significantly. The latest polling for the Sunday Times Scotland put the SNP on 39%, down one point since last month, and the Conservatives up one on 29%. Why are so many Scots still voting Tory? Challenging the polls again, Sturgeon said: \u201cI don\u2019t know that they are. I\u2019ll have that conversation next week and I\u2019ll keep campaigning to stop that happening.\u201d There is the possibility that those who support the union \u2013 support for remaining within the UK was up two points to 53%, according to the Sunday Times Scotland poll \u2013 are lending the Tories their votes. The Scottish Tories have run a highly personalised campaign focused on Sturgeon\u2019s independence demands, in the hope this could sway undecideds. Meanwhile, Sturgeon in the final week of campaigning is emphasising that a vote for the SNP on Thursday need not be a vote for independence. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to countless people on this campaign trail who have said to me they are not SNP voters normally, and they wouldn\u2019t necessarily vote for independence in a referendum, but they want to make sure they vote in a way that maximises the chances of keeping the Tories out of government. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s a narrative, discussion and consideration around tactical voting in this election that I have not experienced previously.\u201d With the SNP running second in all Scottish Tory seats, she added: \u201cPeople understand that this election is not going to decide the issue of independence. People may well vote SNP to keep the Tories out, given the crossroads and the prospect of Boris Johnson for five years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
