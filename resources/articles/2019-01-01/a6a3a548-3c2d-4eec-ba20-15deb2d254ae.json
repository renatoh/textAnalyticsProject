Responding to May\u2019s offer of swift talks to break the Brexit impasse, the Labour leader told MPs that before he would entertain \u201cpositive discussions about the way forward\u201d she had to agree to his precondition. \u201cThe government must remove clearly once and for all the catastrophe of a no-deal exit from the European Union and all the chaos that would result from that,\u201d Corbyn said minutes after the opposition party was defeated in the confidence vote. Minutes after the exchanges in the Commons, with Downing Street refusing to take no deal off the table, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said that as things stood, the Labour leader would not take up May\u2019s offer of an evening Brexit meeting. The two sides were still in discussions, but in light of such a fundamental difference, appeared unlikely to come to an agreement to speak in the immediate future \u2013 even though only 10 weeks remain until the UK\u2019s planned departure date. When asked directly if Corbyn was going to No10, the spokesman added: \u201cAs I understand it that is not going to take place.\u201d Labour is willing to support a Brexit deal if May will accept a customs union, a close relationship with the single market and enhanced protections for workers and consumers rights. However, this would represent a massive shift for the prime minister and risk splits in her own party, making it hard to see how a deal could be agreed. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman acknowledged this, saying, \u201cAny change in the government red lines will cause them internal splits.\u201d With the Brexit impasse no closer to being resolved, Corbyn is also under growing pressure from second referendum campaigners to embrace a fresh vote as a way forward. Earlier on Wednesday, half a dozen Labour MPs came out in support of a second referendum for the first time at a Westminster photocall, arguing that it was the \u201cthe only logical option\u201d if the party could not secure a general election. But the timing of their demand, a couple of hours before Jeremy Corbyn opened the no-confidence debate, irritated the party\u2019s leadership, who said afterwards that another national poll was \u201cnot the default option\u201d if the Commons vote was lost. Debbie Abrahams and Lilian Greenwood, both former frontbenchers, were among 71 MPs who signed a statement saying the party must back a second referendum hours before Corbyn was due to move a vote of no confidence. The statement said: \u201cWe must try and remove this government from office as soon as possible \u2026 But the removal of the government and pushing for a general election may prove impossible.\u201d In that situation, the MPs called on Labour to \u201cjoin trade unions, our members and a majority of our constituents by then unequivocally backing the only logical option to help our country move forward: putting the decision back to the people for a final say, in a public vote, with the option to stay and keep the deal that we have\u201d. But at lunchtime, when Corbyn\u2019s spokesman was asked if the MPs\u2019 actions were a distraction, he replied: \u201cRight now the priority is to bring about a general election; we\u2019ve got a no-confidence motion down today.\u201d Frustration about the timing of the MPs\u2019 actions \u2013 some of whom want Labour to move to supporting a second referendum within days \u2013 spilled into the open when Joe Bradley, a member of staff in the leader\u2019s office, tweeted: \u201cNot one of these MPs cares about removing a Tory government\u201d in response to a picture of the photocall. Bradley, who is responsible for trade union and NEC relations, subsequently deleted the tweet, and then his Twitter account, and Corbyn\u2019s office said it did not comment on staffing matters. Other MPs who had not previously declared their support for another referendum included John Grogan, Graham Jones, Stephen Morgan and Matt Western, according to the organisers of the statement released on Wednesday morning. The expectation that Labour would lose the vote of no confidence had added to pressure for the party to back a second referendum, despite the reservations of the party\u2019s leadership. Labour\u2019s repeatedly stated policy was to press for an election after May\u2019s deal was voted down, but then to consider a second referendum as an option if no election could be secured. Stephen Doughty, one of the organisers of the declaration, said Labour\u2019s leadership had \u201cgood reasons\u201d for taking its time. But he added: \u201cThe clock is ticking, therefore we have to move forward, because it\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s investments, it\u2019s our public services that are at risk.\u201d Other Labour sources closer to the party\u2019s leadership said only a handful of MPs had supported a fresh referendum for the first time, and noted that the number who signed the declaration was well below the 100 figure that had been touted earlier. The organisers of the letter said there were a further 24 Labour MPs who supported a second referendum who had not signed the statement for administrative reasons, or because their position was already well known. Other Labour MPs called on Corbyn to act more quickly if the confidence vote was defeated. Bridget Phillipson said: \u201cIn the event we don\u2019t succeed in securing a general election, we should commit immediately to going back to the people in a fresh referendum.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
