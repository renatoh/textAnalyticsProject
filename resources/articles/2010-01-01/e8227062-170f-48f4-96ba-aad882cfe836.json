As usual, the story concerns my parents. I think it fair to describe my mother as a movie fan. Not many people risk excommunication from the Catholic church just to see a film, but she did. In the year of Our Lord 1946, the Bishop of Derry issued a decree that no man, woman or child was to attend that shocking display of lust and debauchery, the film Duel in the Sun, starring Jennifer Jones and Gregory Peck. His power stretched through Donegal as well, and his authority was absolute. Well, nearly absolute. No man was going to stop my mother and her pal, Anna Roe, from feasting their eyes on Gregory Peck. Come Saturday, they were on the first bus to Derry. They crossed the border, hung about outside the cinema so the show could start and they'd sneak in unnoticed, fell into rapture at the beauty of Mr Peck, then forgot to do a runner before the film ended and so were basked in light, exposing them to the multitude who had also defied the bishop's edict. \"It's all right, nobody will know us,\" my mother hissed at Anna. They looked about them. The entire population of Buncrana, our home town, was in that theatre. Well, we're a religious people, inclined to worship idols. Hollywood was one means of defiance in a country that did not have many ways of saying boo back to its masters. The conformity that typified Ireland from the 1940s through the 1960s faced few challenges. Ours was a society hellbent on presenting a comfortable, self-sufficient front to the world, presided over by our dear leader Eamon De Valera. Divorce was anathema to De Valera, and so marriage became a living hell for far too many couples. (In my play, a warring couple have a terrible impact on their growing daughter, who is struggling against all the odds to open her mind to liberating ideas.) During those same years, a second famine was consuming the Irish: a famine of ideas, of the imagination and of education for all but the elite. Even by the 60s, my home county of Donegal saw most of its teenagers leave school before the age of 14. My part of the county, Inishowen, had no grammar school for boys until the beginning of that decade. The Republic of Ireland was a country massively failing its own people, particularly its children. Then came two beacons of light. The taoiseach, Se\u00e1n Lemass, set out to revitalise our economy; and his minister of education, Donogh O'Malley, introduced the most radical government act since the foundation of the country: a bill providing free tuition for all up to the end of secondary school, and scholarships for the poor to go to university. It is one of these scholarships that Colette Hennessy, the youngest character in the play, wins, bringing upon her head enormous upheaval. Garbo really did visit Donegal, in the mid-1970s, but I have spun an entirely new fiction out of that fact. In reality, her main meeting was with the English painter Derek Hill, who later donated his house and magnificent collection of modern art to the Irish people. In my play, she visits in 1967 and meets a very different character, with a very different career (though in his strange, unpredictable way he is just as benevolent). I have made Garbo the catalyst that changes everyone's lives within the play. She was always her own woman. Whatever you imagined her to be, in life and on film, she would defy it. She was capable of creating many more than two faces, liable to cause havoc, and she exits the scene before we fully know she has arrived, leaving only the consequences of her visit. She wants to be alone, remember? So she chooses to be \u2013 but not before working a miracle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
