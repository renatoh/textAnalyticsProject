It was hard to imagine the Edinburgh-set comedy/drama without its key character, Fiona (played marvellously by Phyllis Logan), who died at the end of the last series, and in fact we haven't had to. Fiona's still around \u2013 only now she's a ghost. The joy of Baggage has always lain in the warmth and realism of its characters' relationships, and Caroline, the narrator, is a cheeringly no-nonsense sort, so introducing a spectral element was quite a stretch. It works, though, because Caroline and Fiona just carry on they always did \u2013 sniping, grumbling and laughing together. The fact that Caroline's father, Hector, has taken up online gambling, been thrown out by his wife and is now sleeping with Caroline's other closest friend, Ruth, has been rather startling: \"You've got your own Greek drama going on here in the New Town,\" sniffs Fiona. But Caroline's working hard on adjusting to the new order of things. Not that she's a pushover: \"Ruth, I draw the line at you being my stepmother,\" she announces. \"Oh, be quiet, Cinderella,\" comes the reply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
