We've really begun to feel the money coming in now, and morale is much higher than a couple of years ago. The problems we were having over recruitment and retention are much less: we're even attracting back some people who left the London service to work elsewhere. Some of the money's gone into improving our equipment - things like satellite navigation for ambulances and mobile data terminals. We're thinking flexibly about other kinds of vehicles and have even started a scheme with paramedics on bicycles in central London. We haven't yet reached the targets government has set us, but we're getting there - we're hitting about 75% of all blue light calls in eight minutes, but we're aiming for 90%. Congestion charging hasn't made much difference, except to the pocket. But the service does help towards the cost. I got promoted during the year: I'm now a team leader on \u00a325,200. If I was still doing my old job I'd be earning \u00a323,400 against \u00a322,000 last year. The firemen? Yes they deserve \u00a330,000, but then so do we. But we've had to modernise. I can't see them getting the money without modernisation. It would be good if they had better training in first aid. If they carried shock boxes - defibs - they'd save lives. Public voices: March 21 2002 Paramedic, London Ambulance Service Salary: \u00a322,000 Things are really looking up. We've got a four year improvement programme, in which we're aiming to hit 90% of all life-threatening calls within eight minutes. The chief executive told us he was going to fight for new investment for the equipment we need to hit these targets and that if we did hit them we'd benefit financially ourselves. My pay went up 10% last year, from \u00a320,000 to \u00a322,000. It's a good approach. The government realises we're suffering from years of under-investment, but they've said that they'll link new money to us hitting targets. In the past we got no extra pay for working the worst shifts - 11pm to 3am at weekends. Now we're paid double time, which is only fair. We're aiming for another \u00a329.5m from the government. That would enable us to buy all the software we need in the control room and ambulances to speed up our response times. In the last year we've also had a lot more training - especially in safety procedures when dealing with potentially violent people. We're now taught how to defend ourselves and we're trialling anti-stab vests. There are still plenty of hurdles ahead. Ambulance stations in inner London want to know who's going to pay Ken Livingstone's congestion charging - you can't expect ambulancemen to pay to come into work. If we had clean, efficient and safe public transport we wouldn't mind so much. It's still a struggle to live on \u00a322,000 in London. A newly-trained policeman gets \u00a326,000 a year. Quite right, too. But I've been a paramedic for 12 years now, and I think I deserve a bit more. But there really is a feeling that we're going somewhere now. We feel we could be the flagship service of the NHS. Things are definitely getting better. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Paramedic, London Ambulance Service Salary: \u00a320,000 My dad was a fireman, and I was tempted to follow him but something about the ambulance service appealed - I liked the camaraderie and the feeling you can help people - change their lives. I joined when I was 21 and did 10 week's training. After 18 months as a qualified technician I did a further training as a paramedic. I work a basic 40-hour week. The job's interesting and fulfilling, but it's definitely got more stressful. In an average 12-hour shift you'll do eight to 12 jobs, so often you don't get a rest or a hot meal. One new strain is violence on staff. People used to call an ambulance for help. Now, if you turn up they see your uniform and they abuse you and attack you. We all wear stab-proof vests now. They know you carry drugs on an ambulance, so sometimes they try and steal them. I've been attacked - I think the guy was high on drugs. I ended up with a black eye and my glasses smashed. We now try to prosecute anyone who attacks a crew. When you train they show you pictures of injuries. There are still occasions when you might see injuries that are shocking. At the time you're so focused on the treatment you don't think about it, but it sometimes hits you later. I was first on the scene at the Soho bomb - when I got home that night I just needed to talk about it to my wife. Some staff were unable to return to work after that. I also did the Paddington rail crash and things like IRA bombs. It can be upsetting: you're treating someone and they saying \"I am going to die, help me, help me.\" Even when you're in the control room it's stressful - a mother crying \"my baby's stopped breathing\" and you're waiting for the ambulance to get there. The thing that keeps you going is knowing that you make a difference. There are at least a dozen people alive today who had cardiac arrests and whom I resuscitated at the scene. I've kept in touch with some of them. We have a real problem keeping people. After 15 years in this job my basic pay is \u00a318,500, plus a London allowance of \u00a31,500. That's the same as someone who's one year qualified. My pay will stay the same from now on until I retire. I commute in from Potters' Bar on my motorbike and end up doing 60-70 hours a month overtime - all at flat rate, nothing extra for nights or weekends. I've got three kids, and my wife gave up working because we decided that was better than forking out for childcare. I could have become a train driver and earned \u00a325,000. I think I'm worth \u00a325,000. I can't imagine going on till 65. When I first started there were ambulances waiting for calls. Now it's the other way round. It doesn't matter how many doctors and hospitals you have if the patients are dead on arrival. I sometimes think the Government forgets that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
