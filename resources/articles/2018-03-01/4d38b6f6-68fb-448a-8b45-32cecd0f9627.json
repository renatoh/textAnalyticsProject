Armand won his solitary cap against Argentina last summer but Jones has since resisted calls to select the Zimbabwe-born back-row and previously questioned his work rate. With England outgunned at the breakdown in back-to-back defeats by Scotland and France, however, and the loss of two members of his starting back row, Armand was included in a 32-man squad on Sunday night. The 29-year-old is enjoying a fine season with Exeter and has the power Jones stated was lacking after Saturday\u2019s defeat in Paris. England missed Hughes badly when he went off in the first half and, with Lawes also out of action \u2013 both are due to have scans on Monday \u2013 Armand fits the bill for the hard-edged forward needed against Ireland. Jones, however, does not believe England can significantly fix their breakdown problems before facing Ireland \u2013 or even before the 2019 World Cup. He has pinpointed that area as his side\u2019s main weakness and believes the problem is deep-rooted in the English game, putting his players at a profound disadvantage compared with Ireland, the newly crowned Six Nations champions. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the breakdown; we\u2019ve got to sort [it] out and find ways of getting quick ball,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf the game continues to be refereed like this, the World Cup is going to be very contestable at the breakdown. If that\u2019s how they want to do it, we\u2019ve got to adapt to that. We can address it and keep getting better at it but the reality is we probably won\u2019t get better at it until the World Cup.\u201d With only one Premiership club in the last eight of Europe\u2019s Champions Cup \u2013 there are four from France\u2019s Top 14 and three from the Pro14 \u2013 the problems encountered by England are mirrored at domestic level. Jones did not attribute any blame to the Premiership sides but the contrast is vast between England, whose interests often collide with that of the clubs, and Ireland, where the relationship is far more symbiotic. Asked if Irish provinces\u2019 approach at the breakdown gives their national side an advantage, Jones said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious. There are obviously similarities [between England and the Premiership clubs]. The French contest hard at the breakdown and the Pro14 sides contest hard at the breakdown, so they get used to playing that sort of game. \u201cIt\u2019s not a club problem. It is our problem. I can\u2019t blame the Premiership. We\u2019ve got our problems that we\u2019ve got to sort out at international level. We\u2019ve got to break old habits first, then introduce new habits. It\u2019s the hardest thing to do.\u201d James Haskell, who made his first England appearance since last March against France, also acknowledged the difference between Premiership and international matches. \u201cWe\u2019re coming from the Premiership, where no one competes at the breakdown, into the Six Nations where every team is throwing lots of people into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been quick enough to adjust to that. International rugby is dramatically different now from where it was 12 months ago. It\u2019s lot more of a power game.\u201d In the past Jones has recruited the former Australia flanker George Smith as a consultant but the head coach does not believe a specialist breakdown coach is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a technical problem. There are other issues apart from being technical and a lot of it has got to do with power.\u201d As a result the absences of Billy Vunipola and Hughes are keenly felt, as is that of a fit and firing Manu Tuilagi. \u201cManu\u2019s off the pace and he just needs consistent rugby but certainly he\u2019s the sort of guy that suits the sort of rugby that\u2019s being played at the moment,\u201d Jones said. Armand and Haskell, as well as Kyle Sinckler, likewise fit the mould and may come into the side against Ireland after catching the eye off the bench in Paris. England have also called up Exeter\u2019s Henry Slade for the first time in this year\u2019s competition after recovering from a shoulder injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
