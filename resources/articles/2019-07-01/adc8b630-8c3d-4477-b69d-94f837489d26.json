Ostensibly, Boris Johnson and Steve Bruce have little in common \u2013 even if many observers predict their two tenures will end in tears \u2013 yet both are obsessed with redefining relationships. Whereas separation from Europe remains Johnson\u2019s fixation, Bruce\u2019s emphasis is on somehow succeeding where Rafael Ben\u00edtez failed and creating a close, yet equal, partnership with Mike Ashley. Newcastle\u2019s owner joined his latest manager on Tyneside on Wednesday, after landing at the training ground in his helicopter. \u201cGetting on with the people you work for is always key to any success,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me to strike up a relationship and, so far, he\u2019s been straight as a die. I\u2019m sure that will continue.\u201d Given that fans deeply disenchanted by Ben\u00edtez\u2019s resignation are not only underwhelmed by Bruce\u2019s installation but planning to boycott Newcastle\u2019s opening home game against Arsenal next month, the former Sheffield Wednesday manager knows delicate diplomacy will be called for. He is well aware another predecessor, Alan Pardew, was almost hounded out of Toon after being perceived as Ashley\u2019s puppet. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be anybody\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 man,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI\u2019m too long in the tooth for that. I\u2019ve heard it said that I\u2019m a puppet but I\u2019m not Mike Ashley\u2019s bagman or anything else. I\u2019m my own man. All I ask is to be given a chance. Whoever was sitting here would find it difficult, Rafa had quite phenomenal, unbelievable support from the fans, and they are big shoes to fill. But let me have a crack.\u201d Ben\u00edtez quit after deciding that Ashley could not match his ambitions for Newcastle and Bruce too craves much more than merely avoiding relegation. \u201cRafa\u2019s ended up going and working in China,\u201d he said, slightly pointedly, after settling into a seat which had earlier been occupied by Joelinton, Newcastle\u2019s new record \u00a340m Brazilian striker. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the case that the ambition here is finishing 17th. Of course Mike Ashley wants more than 17th. We\u2019ve got to take the club forward.\u201d Which is where he believes the FA Cup could come in. \u201cAt Hull we got to the final,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be an aim here. I\u2019ve put my neck on the line immediately with that but it\u2019s not just about being happy to stay in the division. That would be wrong. \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s very, very difficult now to get anywhere near the top of the Premier League. But we\u2019ll try our best. Can we win the FA Cup? Can we win the League Cup? If Hull can stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final surely Newcastle has the tools too?\u201d Similarly Bruce backs his abilities to confound the doubters. \u201cI understand I\u2019m not the majority of supporters\u2019 cup of tea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not Rafa Ben\u00edtez, who is an extremely good manager. I have broad shoulders and I will need them. But hopefully, given time, I\u2019ll win people round and the supporters will say \u2018he\u2019s not so bad after all\u2019.\u201d Although many friends, Alan Shearer included, cautioned him against accepting the job, Bruce could not reject the club he supported as a boy. \u201cI had the chance when Sir Bobby Robson left, turned it down out of loyalty to Birmingham and regretted a terrible decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought there\u2019d be another chance of coming back. I\u2019m aware of the problems but I\u2019m a geordie and that\u2019s probably the reason I\u2019m sitting here. Apart from my brief spell down the road [managing Sunderland] I\u2019ve been away from the north-east a long time but, when you\u2019re from here, Newcastle\u2019s always with you.\u201d The acrimony-enveloped journey from Hillsborough has cost him a lot of friends in South Yorkshire. \u201cI\u2019ve been totally selfish,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel for the players, the staff and everyone at Sheffield Wednesday but I had to have a crack at this. I think I\u2019ve got the tools to take this club forward.\u201d Joelinton\u2019s arrival represents a useful restocking of the attacking armoury. \u201cI watched him playing for Hoffenheim against Manchester City in the Champions League and he\u2019s very, very good,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with him. Hopefully over the next two weeks we\u2019ll get three or four more in. I\u2019ve had the conversation and there is money to spend.\u201d Ashley may have sold another forward, Ayoze P\u00e9rez to Leicester, for \u00a330m this summer but Bruce is adamant Newcastle\u2019s promising young midfielder Sean Longstaff will not be joining Manchester United for \u00a350m. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very confident he won\u2019t go.\u201d Indeed retaining Longstaff could prove integral to building healthy relationships with both Ashley and the fans. \u201cMaybe one day the supporters will sing my name,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cThat\u2019s not important to me ... but, if they do sing it one day, it\u2019ll be a sign we\u2019ve done OK.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
