Universities have confirmed they are making plans to start the next academic year online if social distancing continues. Vice-chancellors are braced for potential huge losses from the lucrative international student market from September, following disruption to end-of-school learning and exams, as well as to the English-language testing required to get into a UK university. And now experts are warning that if social distancing measures stretch into the autumn, many UK-based students might also choose to defer going to university rather than start the year in their bedrooms at home. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank says: \u201cI feel for these young people as their A-levels have been disrupted and they won\u2019t get to go to their school leavers\u2019 proms. Now they may not have their freshers\u2019 weeks either.\u201d He warns that if home students don\u2019t turn up in September, institutions will face a dangerous cut in income. \u201cSome universities will start falling over. Universities will play a valuable part in pulling us out of the recession that is coming, so it is more important than ever that they survive.\u201d Vice-chancellors are hoping to reopen campuses in time for the new academic year, but say they are working on contingency plans in case the lockdown is still in place, or they are forced to close again at short notice if the virus resurges in the winter. Many institutions are proposing to start first-year degrees online and move to face-to-face lectures and teaching in the second term, or as soon as campuses are able to open. But some say this is not a good option for school-leavers who haven\u2019t yet learned to study independently, and they would push the start of the year back to January. Colin McCaig, professor of higher education policy at Sheffield Hallam University, says: \u201cI have real doubts about young people\u2019s willingness or preparedness to start an online degree this autumn.\u201d Existing students who are used to studying at university are more able to cope with the disruption of teaching shifting online for a term or two, he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s another thing entirely for young people who have been looking forward to starting the more usual higher education experience.\u201d Diana Paton, William Robertson professor of history at Edinburgh University, has been talking to her daughter about the possibility that the drama degree she plans to begin at Queen Mary University of London in September might have to start online. \u201cWe are advising her to wait and see. But drama is a very practical subject that involves working with other people in the same physical space. So she doesn\u2019t feel it would make sense for her to start studying her degree online, and we agree,\u201d she says. Paton says this would be a big disappointment for her daughter, who has already had her gap year ruined by the virus, having returned from a planned three-month trip to south-east Asia after only three weeks. She thinks starting online would be challenging for students regardless of their subject. \u201cOne of the things first-year undergraduates find difficult is the transition from school to university. Part of dealing with that is getting to know their cohort, and meeting people outside of their degree.\u201d Hillman agrees that first-year students may feel lost without a face-to-face university experience. \u201cOur research has shown that students really like lectures. That\u2019s not because they are a good way to learn, but because they are a social occasion. Online learning is a good second best, but for many it is just that \u2013 second best.\u201d He adds: \u201cStudents who move into a hall with 300 other people often feel lonely, so how are you going to feel if you are sitting in a bedroom at home on your own?\u201d Hillman says many young people will not be keen to put university on hold. But, he adds, if they do, the consequences for universities, already struggling to deal with losing international students, will be grave. Neil Morris, professor of educational technology at the University of Leeds says, however, that good online courses are in fact \u201cvery social\u201d. \u201cThey are very much about interactive discussions and group work. But they have to be designed from the start with that in mind.\u201d With online learning traditionally taking months to design, universities will be scrambling to produce something sufficiently professional and engaging in time for September. Morris says: \u201cI think a lot of universities should be able to do this by the autumn, given that they\u2019ve been up-scaling online provision in recent years anyway. But those that haven\u2019t already been working on this will find it much more difficult.\u201d Dr Doug Clow, who spent 20 years at the Open University and is now advising higher education on the Coronavirus, says universities have delivered an \u201cincredible\u201d emergency response, moving all teaching online overnight with \u201cnext to no resource\u201d. He is confident they will be ready to launch their degrees online in the autumn. \u201cBut the fact is that whatever universities prepare, it is still going to fall far short of what a sensible, planned start to an online programme would be.\u201d Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at the University of Bath, says: \u201cStudents are accepting that the sudden switch to online teaching is all a bit belt and braces, but if we are relying on this as a means of delivery in September then it will need to look and feel much slicker.\u201d He says learning technology experts and academics are working hard to find new ways to put often very complicated teaching online \u2013 but says the sector must not forget poorer students. \u201cThere is a big issue of whether all students have access to high-speed broadband or a quiet place in their household where they can study.\u201d However, Prof Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor of Aston University, is sceptical about pushing first years online. \u201cI\u2019ve always been reticent about online education for school leavers. It is fantastic for older learners who are juggling study alongside work and family commitments, because they tend to be very self-motivated. But it is different if you are just starting out.\u201d If social distancing is still in place, Aston would look at starting first years in January. They would aim to \u201caccelerate\u201d the year, with students making up the lost time between June and August. Chris Ince, secretary and registrar at London Metropolitan University, says his university might also postpone the start of degrees. \u201cWe might look at pushing back enrolment to October or November, depending on what is happening, and then compress the academic year by removing reading weeks and so on.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe already have about 10% of our undergraduate intake starting in January, and they compress their course into two-and-a-half years, so we know it is achievable. But trying to do that with an entire cohort would be a big shift.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
