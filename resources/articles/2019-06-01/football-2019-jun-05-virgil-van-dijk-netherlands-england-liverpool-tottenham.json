The Dutch captain, who played a key part in Liverpool\u2019s victory last Saturday, had endured his own crushing loss in the European Cup final the previous season with defeat by Real Madrid in Kyiv and the hangover lingered through the summer. England have four Spurs players in their 23-man squad but Gareth Southgate is deliberating about resting all those involved in the Champions League final for the game in Guimar\u00e3es after their exertions at the Wanda Metropolitano. \u201cI\u2019m completely in Nations League mode and things are fine in my mind,\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cBut I remember last year when I came back feeling bad [from the Champions League final in Kyiv], very disappointed for quite a while. It\u2019s not easy to come back from it. If the Tottenham players play, they\u2019ll want to show themselves and try and win the game. But, for me, it\u2019s been easier this time than last year certainly. Physically it was tougher then, too. Everything is fine now and, mentally speaking, I\u2019m in a better place. I\u2019m ready. There\u2019s a chance to win a trophy here and for us as a group, we want to go for it.\u201d England have Jordan Henderson, Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold in the squad \u2013 all victors in Madrid \u2013 and they could be rested on Thursday. Ronald Koeman, though, confirmed his two Liverpool players will start the semi-final on Thursday. \u201cAbsolutely, because when you win you\u2019re not tired,\u201d he said of Van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that. When you win a title, that makes you eager for more. When you suffer defeat, it\u2019s harder mentally to get yourself together and move on. \u201cWe had a coffee together because I wanted to check on their physical and mental state. But both were so confident and optimistic about the match against England, so I\u2019ll be lining up with my strongest team. They both belong to that XI.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
