The coupon was published for three weeks in the Guardian, The Observer and on Guardian Unlimited in February asking readers about their holidays. An independent company recorded the data and you can see how the responses have been translated into results. The scoring is straightforward, with readers being asked to rate the quality of service they received on their holidays by ticking one of four boxes: excellent, good, fair or poor. Each company's score was translated into a percentage, allowing us to compare small companies - assessed on fewer holidaymakers' ratings - with larger rivals. A threshold of 50 was set in the main categories, with a sliding scale for those categories obtaining a smaller number of total responses. We are proud to be here to honour the best in the industry, and to pass on the verdicts of an independent and discerning readership who, in all their various and evolving ways, keep on travelling. How to read these results Number in brackets is last year's position. First number is the amount of coupons received. Second number is the percentage score.

The pages were elegant and uncluttered and gave just the sufficient information required to book a holiday, rather than flouncy but vague descriptions or an overwhelming bombardment of facts. Prices are given clearly at the bottom of each page which makes life easier, and details of climate and flights were included. We liked the simple, grown-up cover and thought the whole look of the brochure was modern and stylish. But it was the mouth-watering photos that did it, not hindered by the fact it is a great product. Turquoise's New Zealand brochure was a close runner-up for it's immaculate, crisp design, and we were disappointed last year's winner, Original Travel had not released its new brochure in time to compete. Judges: Jeannette Hyde, travel editor, The Observer; Andy Pietrasik, travel editor, the Guardian; Gwyn Topham, travel editor, Guardian Unlimited; Mariella Fostrup; Roger Browning, deputy art director, the Guardian. Best tour operator website Winner: Inntravel Some of our favourite sites were the most simple: quick to download, easy to navigate and presenting essential information clearly. For example, the basic www.cottagestocastles.com could have your villa booked in moments, while some of the initially attractive sites perhaps promised more than they delivered. All of Discover the World's sites caught the eye. That said, it was ultimately one that combined an unusual design, a wealth of information and some ambitious and well-executed features that got all the judges' votes. Inntravel's website (inntravel.co.uk) is neat, well-maintained, demonstrably evolving and full of ideas. Most of all, the judges felt the site would actually inspire us to book and help us to choose the right holiday: in the words of one, it \"sold it to me\".
