As has been their way in recent seasons the Merseysiders are crawling, rather than sprinting, their way towards salvation. It is an agonising spectacle to behold. They should have won this game but were ultimately grateful for a share of the spoils, the substitute Idan Tal driving home an uncleared corner with just 10 minutes remaining to square things up. Seasoned Everton-watchers could be seen pinching themselves minutes before the kick-off for there, before their very eyes, were Kevin Campbell and Duncan Ferguson sharing the same pitch for the first time since Ferguson returned his battered frame to Merseyside six months ago. Everything comes to he who waits and, somewhat belatedly, the so-called dream pairing was finally up and running. In the aftermath of the FA Cup debacle against Tranmere Rovers - a horror show in the Stephen King mould - Everton's manager Walter Smith shuffled a pack of few aces but many jokers. There were several casualties but, so poor was Saturday's performance, Smith would have enhanced his reputation had he dropped the lot. At least Everton showed more spirit last night, but they still resembled a jigsaw puzzle in need of assembly. While their sustained early pressure was impressive, they remain unable to transform possession into goals. It is a wrong they must swiftly right. Middlesbrough soak up attacks with no apparent discomfort these days; a defence which pre-Venables was both shoddy and sloppy now exudes a measure of authority. Everton dominated the early stages but it was the visitors who scored first in fine style, Hamilton Ricard turning home from no great distance after Alen Boksic had headed on Christian Karembeu's divine cross from the right. Everton promptly threw everything in the general direction of the towering Ferguson - a predictable ploy but one that often yields high dividends. Last night, however, chances came but were carelessly squandered. Campbell and Steve Watson both found room inside a crowded penalty area but lacked the composure to inflict any damage. Middlesbrough may not have deserved to be in front, but nor did they deserve to see Everton restore parity in the manner they did five minutes into an acrimonious second half. As the goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer moved out to collect Watson's orthodox cross he appeared to be nudged in the back by Campbell. But there was no whistle and, as the ball fell at the back post, Gary Naysmith arrived unannounced to score with a stooping header. Having created a platform upon which to build something more meaningful, Everton promptly dismantled it when the goalkeeper Thomas Myhre punched a Curtis Fleming cross high into the air, allowing Colin Cooper to head the ball back over the line. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
