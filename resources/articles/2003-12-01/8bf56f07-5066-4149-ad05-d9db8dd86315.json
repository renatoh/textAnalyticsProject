At other times you have to wonder what lies behind them. Yesterday, for example, we were told that the King of Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, has conferred upon Bernie Ecclestone something called the Bahrain Medal of the First Degree, an award which, so it is said, is usually reserved for heads of state. Well, Ecclestone is a head of state, in a sense. A small state, perhaps, with no geographical boundaries but it can truly be said that formula one exists in a world of its own, with unique laws and customs (and an unusually high percentage of millionaires among its small population). Clearly the rulers of Bahrain were recognising this when they showed their gratitude for Ecclestone's efforts in ensuring that, next April, they will become the first Middle East nation to host a world championship grand prix. Our own honours list has been the subject of various troubling disclosures in recent days, although the stories certainly had their cheering features. First, one's admiration for the likes of David Hockney, Albert Finney, Graham Greene and several other prominent citizens, both living and dead, was intensified by the discovery that, at some time or another, they declined the award of imperial baubles. (Curiously, no sportsmen or women were among their number.) Second, by bringing the whole grubby business into disrepute, the leak of memos from the Ceremonial Office seemed to hasten the end of an institution that, in its present form, does nothing but perpetuate an obsolete idea of Britain. Sadly, however, the story did have one innocent casualty among the ranks of tarnished Whitehall mandarins. Step forward, Tim Henman. According to the leaked memo that concerned the forthcoming New Year's Honours List, there were plans to make Henman a late addition to the recipients of OBEs. The reason, according to the author of the memo, was to \"add interest\" to the list. And thus, at a stroke, the true nature of the governance of modern Britain lay revealed. You think George W Bush insulted the American people by flying to Baghdad to serve their troops a Christmas turkey that turned out to be plastic? You believe the president's bogus gesture said everything there is to say about the supremacy of presentation over substance in modern politics? Think again. When used in connection with Henman, the words \"add interest\" reaffirm the belief that this government and its servants have no interest in genuine achievement except in so far as it can be made to serve their own interests. Achievements are not important in themselves but are valued solely according to their usefulness in PR terms. Thus Henman may - or may not, as we shall see when the list is published on New Year's Day - be put to use in the cause of burnishing the government's image by providing newspapers and broadcasters with something \"interesting\" to cover, thereby making the nation feel better about itself and more comfortable with the status quo. A lot of people look at Henman and don't care much for what they see: a middle-class white Anglo-Saxon product of privilege. Many of those people probably read this newspaper. But Henman deserves better than the casual insult implied in the Whitehall memo. Even if he had retired after winning the Masters Series tournament in Paris a few weeks ago, his four Wimbledon semi-final appearances would constitute an outstanding career achievement when one considers the wasteland of competitive tennis out of which he sprang. There are signs, too, that he may not yet have concluded his business with the Wimbledon title. In beating Nicolas Davydenko, S\u00e9bastien Grosjean, Gustavo Kuerten, Roger Federer, Andy Roddick and Andrei Pavel on carpet in Paris, he operated without a full-time coach, just as he did at Wimbledon in 2001, when he came within two points of reaching the final shortly after parting company with David Felgate. This year he arrived in Paris minus Larry Stefanki, Felgate's eventual successor. Paul Annacone, Pete Sampras's former coach, is currently serving as an occasional sounding board. Henman, however, seems to do better when there is no longer a face on which to focus an imploring gaze when things are going wrong. He will be a couple of weeks past his 30th birthday when next year's Wimbledon tournament begins but if he continues to work things out for himself he can still amaze us all. And then, remembering how they tried to exploit him, he can tell the Whitehall mandarins, as politely as possible, where to stick their knighthood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
