The poll also reveal a yawning gap between the views of Labour loyalists and voters who defected to another party at the last election, especially on the issues of welfare, the economy and immigration. Ashcroft\u2019s polling, conducted in the last fortnight and revealed to the Guardian exclusively, confirms that Ed Miliband was one of the single biggest reasons why people who voted Labour in 2010 decided not to vote for the party in 2015. In potentially the most significant finding about the mindset of party supporters as the leadership ballot closes, the poll shows that 48% of Labour loyalists think the priority should be to win elections even if it means making compromises, while 52% think the priority should be to have the right principles even if it makes it more difficult to win elections. Labour loyalists are defined for the purposes of the polling as voters that backed Labour in 2010 and 2015. Most Labour loyalists and defectors to Ukip agreed that austerity should end \u2013 the chief campaign message of Jeremy Corbyn. Seven in 10 switchers to the Conservatives thought further spending cuts were needed to get the economy back on a stable footing. Four in five Labour defectors to the Conservatives wanted welfare spending tightened up as they considered it to be too generous, while only 31% of Labour loyalists agreed with this view and 69% disagreed. A majority of Labour defectors to Ukip also felt that the welfare system was too generous. All voters \u2013 Labour loyalists, defectors and others \u2013 think immigration rates are too high and that Britain needs to significantly reduce the numbers coming into the country. This view is most strongly held by Labour defectors to Ukip and the Conservatives. Ashcroft said he understood \u201cwhy a party\u2019s first reaction to winning too small a coalition of voters can be to behave in ways that reduces that coalition still further. Activists want to give their time, money and emotional energy for a cause they believe in, among people they agree with \u2013 and the more remote victory seems, the truer this is. \u201cThe voters who have rejected them have also disappointed them, especially if they have gone to the principal enemy; they do not yet have the appetite to try to woo such people back.\u201d A majority of all Labour defectors (57%) and a larger number of Labour defectors to the Tories (69%) said Miliband\u2019s suitability for prime minister was one of the three biggest reasons to abandon the party. The second most cited reason \u2013 by 63% of Conservative defectors \u2013 was a fear that Labour would spend and borrow too much. The third reason was that the country was broadly going in the right direction and that it was not time for a change in government. The polling also shows that those in the Labour electorate who regard Tony Blair as source of shame rather than pride are in the minority. Writing in the Guardian, Ashcroft suggests: \u201cLoyalists as well as defectors to other parties (especially the Conservatives) regard Tony Blair as the best Labour leader for 30 years, as do voters as whole.\u201d While loyalists and defectors overall both said John Smith, the Labour leader in the mid-90s, did a better job at standing up for the party\u2019s values, both groups put Blair ahead of Smith, Neil Kinnock, Gordon Brown and Miliband on representing the whole country, appealing beyond traditional Labour voters and offering strong, competent leadership. Corbyn has prioritised denouncing the British invasion of Iraq, saying he will formally apologise on behalf of the Labour party. Many in the Corbyn campaign have argued that a new winning coalition can be formed of radicals in Scotland, former Green voters, disillusioned Ukip voters and those who otherwise do not vote. Ashcroft argues that Labour needs to win back some of the voters it lost to the Conservatives if it is to have a hope of winning in 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
