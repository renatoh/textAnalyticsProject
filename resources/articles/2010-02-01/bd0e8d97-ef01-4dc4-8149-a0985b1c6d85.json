They last rose to third in the table after their 1-1 draw with Aston Villa in November and, before this evening's return fixture at White Hart Lane, their manager has claimed an Arsenal defeat at Stamford Bridge on Sunday would give hope to the chasing pack. Arsenal are seven points clear of their north London rivals but, with Liverpool visiting the Emirates three days after the trip to Stamford Bridge, Redknapp is aware that gap could tighten in the next week. \"Arsenal are favourites [for third place] but it is not impossible for anyone to catch them, there could be a five- or six-point turnaround. We thought that Chelsea were running away with it, but now look at it \u2013 wide open again,\" he said. \"It is going to be tight. If we would have beaten Birmingham last week when leading 1-0, then we are suddenly not so far away from Arsenal. Someone could get third spot. Manchester City could, we could, Liverpool could. Anyone is capable with a run. Arsenal are not 100% sure to be there if they get beaten by Chelsea and other teams pick up good results.\" Martin O'Neill's Aston Villa, too, must be ranked as contenders. Sitting seventh, two points behind their hosts with a game in hand, Villa would leapfrog Tottenham should they record their second victory in seven days in the capital, after ending a four-game winless run in the league with a 2-0 defeat of Fulham last Saturday. A Michael Dawson volley rescued a point for Tottenham when the sides met at Villa Park in November and Redknapp, unlike Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, was impressed with the manner in which O'Neill's side went about their business. The Villa manager described as \"an appalling insult\" Wenger's assertion that his side \"play a very long-ball game\" and Redknapp has guaranteed a convivial atmosphere between the two technical areas this evening by praising Villa's swashbuckling approach. \"There is more than that [long ball] to them, for sure. They've got terrific ability, they play with two wingers, an attacking midfield. They play two front men, they have a go, they play 4-2-4 almost. But the two wingers work hard when they lose possession, they get back in, they put in a shift in those wide areas.\" Other than Roman Pavlyuchenko, Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto and Aaron Lennon Redknapp has close to a full complement to select from and said he is \"delighted\" for Gareth Bale and David Bentley, who have been given extended runs in the team as cover for the latter two. \"Bentley enjoys playing and wants to be in the team and part of it. He is a sensible footballer and understands football. He knows the game and is not a mug. I think he is quite a sharp lad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
