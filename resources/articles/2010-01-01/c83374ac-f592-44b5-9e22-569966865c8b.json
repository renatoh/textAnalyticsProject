Two of the world's largest bond investors, Pimco and BlackRock, have negative views or are already cutting back on their investments in UK public debt. The two institutions are concerned that further issues of gilts \u2013 to pay for the bailout of banks such as the Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 will depress their prices. Gilt prices are also likely to be hit as the UK government, the biggest investor in the market, begins to withdraw. The government, through the Bank of England, has bought a large amount of its own bonds by printing money and buying the assets from investors, through a process known as quantitative easing, in an effort to re-ignite bank lending and spur growth. But this costly programme will eventually have to stop. \"We are currently cutting back in the US and UK because \u2026 supply and demand dynamics are likely to be negatively affected as borrowing rises and central bank buying declines,\" Pimco said in a note to investors. \"On the other hand, we remain modestly bullish on duration in the eurozone, which \u2026 won't face the same degree of reduction in central bank duration buying in 2010.\" The withdrawal of the government, Pimco, BlackRock and other investors from the market is likely to cut gilt prices, raising yields \u2013 which move in the opposite direction of price. Ultimately, that will lead to higher borrowing rates for Britons, as long-term mortgage prices are linked to gilt yields. Scott Thiel, head of European fixed income at BlackRock, said: \"The lack of investors' appetite will lead to higher financing costs for the government. \"If investor appetite for gilts wanes, that will ultimately cost the Debt Management Office more to issue securities. Investors' appetite has a huge effect on the level of gilts.\" The investors' comments came as a boost to the Conservatives, who attacked high public spending and questioned the government's ability to sell as many bonds as planned. The shadow chief secretary, Philip Hammond, said: \"This announcement by the world's biggest bond house [Pimco] is a damning verdict on Gordon Brown's handling of the economy and raises yet more questions about where the government is going to borrow the \u00a3178bn it needs over the next 12 months.\" The market, though, will have enough appetite to absorb the debt, said Mike Amey, head of UK fixed income at Pimco. \"I don't think the government will have trouble raising the money, the question is at what price. But there's a risk because the government has a high funding need and a lot of that has been facilitated by the Bank of England, so there's a risk that interest rates will have to rise to compensate.\" Coincidentally, Pimco's portfolio management unit employs Andrew Balls, brother of Ed Balls, secretary of state for children, schools and families, who is helping direct Labour's election strategy. But not all investors are as negative on the gilt market. Robin Creswell, of Payden &amp; Rygel, a bond investor, said the party that won the forthcoming general election would need fiscal discipline to maintain the trust of markets and to avoid a credit downgrade. \"If you have the deficit under control, you're not adding to the supply of gilts,\" he said. \"Any government will go to great trouble to keep their credit worthiness and the confidence of the markets.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
