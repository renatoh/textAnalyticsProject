And despite hinting that he would like to continue with TMS, the former England opener also went out in typically fiery style, aiming a dig at the BBC. Responding to the story confirming that Boycott\u2019s TMS innings had come to an end, a Twitter contributor wrote: \u201cWhite, male, straight, tory and knows about cricket. Surprised he lasted this long at the BBC.\u201d Boycott retweeted the comment, adding: \u201cAbsolutely right\u201d, before later deleting it. The 79-year-old then returned to Twitter to confirm that he would not be involved in commentating on England\u2019s series against West Indies and Pakistan, pointing out that he recently underwent a quadruple heart bypass and that the bio-secure arrangements for this summer\u2019s Test matches were not the right environment for him at this stage of his life. Writing on social media, Boycott said: \u201cI would like to thank bbctms BBCSport for a wonderful 14 years. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and just love cricket with a passion. I also wish to thank all those that have said how much they have enjoyed my commentary and for those that haven\u2019t \u2013 too bad. \u201cMy contract with BBC finished end of last summer. I would loved to continue but need to be realistic &amp; honest with myself. Covid-19 has made the decision for both of us.\u201d Boycott added that he was the \u201cwrong age\u201d to be working in confined spaces due to social distancing regulations. The former Yorkshire batsman, who was knighted last year, has been a regular on TMS since 2005, having lost previous commentary roles with both the BBC and Sky Sports following a 1998 conviction in a French court for assaulting his then-girlfriend Margaret Moore. Though his contract is now over, Boycott hinted he could still make the occasional appearance on the airwaves in the future. Referring to his long-time colleague Jonathan Agnew, he wrote: \u201cHopefully I may still have some input bbctms if that tall lanky ex Leicestershire medium pace bowler needs an honest appraisal or wants to take the mickey out of me maybe he will give me a call while on air To everyone out there Be sensible Stay alive Your life is precious.\u201d Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, paid tribute to Boycott. She said: \u201cGeoffrey has been an iconic voice in our Test Match Special box for 14 years. \u201cWhile we wish the circumstances were different, we would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank him for his contribution to our cricket commentary over the years and we\u2019re still hoping to hear his unique cricketing insight at some point on TMS this summer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
