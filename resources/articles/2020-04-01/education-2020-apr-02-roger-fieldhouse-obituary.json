Roger was appointed tutor/organiser for the WEA (Workers\u2019 Educational Association) in North Yorkshire in the mid-1960s, and developed a lifelong love of the area. He worked with local people to explore the history of their own communities. His book A History of Swaledale and Richmond (1978) was scholarly and authoritative. He worked closely with several colourful Dales characters, who became family friends; and with Joan Maynard, the indefatigable advocate of agricultural workers, who later became a prominent leftwing Labour MP. In 1970, Roger was appointed to the department of adult education and extramural studies at the University of Leeds: later, he became responsible, as head of department, for all the liberal adult education work of the school of continuing education. Roger was committed to a \u201csocial purpose\u201d perspective on adult education: \u201ca democratic, dialectical and non-utilitarian approach\u201d, as he put it. He aimed to provide \u201cindividuals with the knowledge which they can use collectively to change society if they so wish\u201d, with a particular focus upon enabling working-class students to \u201cchallenge the inequalities and injustices of society in order to bring about radical social change\u201d. Among his many publications, A History of Modern British Adult Education (1996) remains the standard text; he wrote a definitive history of the British anti-apartheid movement (2005); and he and I co-edited EP Thompson and English Radicalism (2013). Roger was born in East Sheen, south-west London, the second of four sons of Ernest Fieldhouse, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Phyllis (nee Scott). After Wellington school, Roger studied modern history at Reading University, 1960-63; later, studying part-time, he was awarded a PhD (on the ideology of English adult education) by Leeds University. During his time at Leeds, Roger and his wife, Gill (nee Taylor), enjoyed a busy family life in Harrogate, bringing up their four children - Catherine, William, Edward and Victoria. They later divorced. In 1986, Roger was appointed to the chair of continuing education at the University of Exeter, a post that he occupied until his retirement in 1996. He enjoyed village life in Devon and came to know Devon and Cornwall well. But he also travelled internationally \u2013 to Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, with his partner of more than 30 years, Roseanne Benn. Roger, an English Romantic at heart, loved the English countryside. He was a member for 40 years of a group of friends who met for walking weekends in the Lake District; he was an enthusiast for English pubs and cricket; and we enjoyed for many years joint family holidays on the Welsh coast. He had, above all, a lifelong love of the Yorkshire Dales. Roger was a kind and generous man, much loved, valued and respected by family, friends, colleagues and students. He is survived by Roseanne, whom he married in 2015, three stepdaughters and six step-grandchildren; and by the four children, and 11 grandchildren, from his marriage to Gill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
