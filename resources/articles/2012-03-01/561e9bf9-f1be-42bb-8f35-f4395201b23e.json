Coe, the chairman of the London Olympics who promised in the speech that helped secure the 2012 Games to inspire a generation of children to play more sport, also said the survey system used by Sport England to measure participation was not capturing what he believed was an increase in participation. \"I'm not sure we're quite capturing it in a cohesive way. I will be open about this. I'm always a little loth to take at face value some of the surveys taken by organisations that have singularly failed in the past to do this. I just don't know.\" Earlier this week, the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said the measurement system used by the quango \u2013 which invests around \u00a3250m a year of Lottery and treasury money \u2013 was \"utterly duff\". The previous government promised to use the inspirational power of the Games to boost the number of people playing sport three or more times a week by 1m by 2013. But the Guardian revealed last year that the coalition government had decided to drop the measure, after only 109,000 people were added to the figures. Coe said that his organising committee was not responsible for delivering the legacy, but that he would keep the pressure on politicians to deliver it after the Games. \"I don't want this to sound like this is not my job, but actually it isn't. We created the best platform in living memory to create the environment for that to happen. This begins after 2012. We finish and go off to do whatever we do. The judgment of Londoners and millions around the country will be delivered on what political energy is brought to the table to deliver and evolve.\" Coe insisted that an uplift in sports participation ahead of the Games was not being captured by the existing Active People survey, which costs Sport England between \u00a33m and \u00a34m a year to conduct. \"Off the back of our sponsors alone, 750,000 more kids are playing sport,. Across the global partnerships and sponsor commitments we've made domestically probably 6m people are involved in programmes of health related fitness than were active before,\" claimed Coe. \"If you speak to [the British Cycling performance director] Dave Brailsford he will tell you he's got half a million more cyclists than pre-Beijing.\" Coe also again defended the approach of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the face of accusations that it had badly underestimated security numbers, leading to the costs almost doubling to \u00a3553m. \"We've worked collaboratively, we're not the lead role on security, that's government, as the Host City contract says,\" said Coe, who was speaking at the Global Sports Forum in Barcelona. \"We're working alongside the Metropolitan police, the Home Office and now the Ministry of Defence. It will come together in a proper and orderly way but it comes together at the end of the project. I don't think we should be coy or naive about that. Security is what it needs to be and has to be proportionate,\" he said. \"The nature of it is that initial work does take place but it takes place when you're bringing a mass of information to it.\" Coe also defended the ticketing system that has come under fire ahead of the final batch of tickets going on sale next month. \"Given the extraordinary scale of the project, we've had moments when we're really working hard to make sure it was working as wanted it,\" he said. \"But on balance when we get remaining 4m tickets across the line it will have been tough exercise but we will have achieved what we set out to in a very sensible way.\" Sport England said: \"Active People is a robust survey that provides the official statistics for measuring sports participation across the country and in a huge range of sports. The survey is also used by the Department of Health and local authorities to track participation in physical activity at the local level and by the Department for Transport to monitor levels of participation in cycling. We are currently reviewing how we will measure participation under our new strategy, both to capture the number of 14- and 15-year-olds taking part and to ensure that we continue to reflect participation by all sections of society, including those without a landline.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
