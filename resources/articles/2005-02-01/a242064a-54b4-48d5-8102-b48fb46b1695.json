Late goals from Paul Evans and Kris Commons gave them a victory that looked well beyond them during an opening hour dominated by the visitors. Preston put Forest under pressure from the start, forcing two corners in the opening three minutes, and it quickly became clear that they were finding it easy to work their wingers Eddie Lewis and Chris Sedgwick into space behind the home team's five-man midfield. Lewis looked dangerous cutting inside; his left-foot drive after 15 minutes brought a fine save from Paul Gerrard. Forest, playing largely on the break, were restricted to the occasional shot from distance. Even so they were a threat because in Commons they have a striker who hits the ball as hard and accurately as anyone in the Championship, and he twice stung the hands of Chris Day, making his debut in the Preston goal. Forest were out early for the second period but the pattern of the game did not change. Once more Lewis found space down the Forest left, but this time crossed low. Richard Cresswell got his foot to the ball before Wes Morgan but again could not beat the alert Gerrard. Forest's manager Gary Megson, not before time, reacted by switching to a conventional 4-4-2 and brought on David Johnson in the hope of gaining some penetration up front. With 15 minutes left Lewis had Preston's best chance of the match. Unmarked on the left as usual, he had only Gerrard to beat but from well inside the area he hit his shot too straight and the goalkeeper deflected the ball wide with his foot. Forest swept back upfield, Commons crossed from the left, and Paul Evans headed past the helpless Day. Shortly afterwards Commons, on the left wing, saw Day off his line and beat him from 35 yards. Preston's sense of injustice ensured the match ended with an edge. \"It's frustrating, because we controlled the match. But we're still in a good position and we know what we have to do in our last 12 matches,\" said Preston's manager Billy Davies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
