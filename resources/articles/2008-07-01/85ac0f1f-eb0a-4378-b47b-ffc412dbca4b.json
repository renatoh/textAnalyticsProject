Brazilian disco rock quintet CSS are no exception. They are spitting mad at their former manager, who allegedly worked them like beasts and paid them in shots of J\u00e4germeister. There's nothing wrong with bile in pop, as 'Left Behind' and 'Rat Is Dead' attest. What is more distressing here is CSS's rush to embrace proficiency. They've learned to play, improved their English and secured the funding for a slick second coming. In the process, their charms have been Botoxed out and their slapdash genius paved over to build a mall. Kitty Empire Sharleen Spiteri Melody (Mercury) \u00a311.99 Calling this her Nancy Sinatra record, Texas frontwoman Sharleen Spiteri unleashes a flurry of trumpets and parping saxophones. Her sultry, provocative voice sits well with Sixties soul, but treading the same ground as some of the most stunning female voices past and present, including a track produced by Duffy collaborator Bernard Butler, is a mistake. While Shangri-Las cover 'All the Times I Cried' is still an undeniable pop classic, the rest of this album has a tired Motown-by-numbers feel and none of Spiteri's own songs makes a lasting impression. Katie Toms John Matthias &amp; Nick Ryan Cortical Songs (Non classical) \u00a313.99 It's a forbidding prospect. Two members of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Musical Research at the University of Plymouth have composed a work in four movements for a string ensemble partially controlled by a tiny computer brain. They've asked a bunch of intrepid musicians, including the Verve's Simon Tong, to remix it using only the existing sounds. The results are compelling. The original pieces, led by John Matthias's solo violin, are by turns unnerving and beautiful. Matthias's former university bandmate Thom Yorke creates a superb reinterpretation, as does one-time Pogue Jem Finer, who took inspiration from the nerve fibres of a squid. Natty Man Like I (Atlantic) \u00a39.99 Taking his name from a Bob Marley album, 24-year-old north Londoner Natty invites unfortunate comparisons with the Jamaican superstar. Lyrically, his debut is strong, tackling street culture and multiculturalism with insight and panache on 'Burn Down This Place' and 'Cold Town' respectively; it's just a shame the music is so beige. His voice has a rich timbre and he strums his acoustic guitar sweetly enough, but the breezy reggae-folk compositions are mostly forgettable, with too many tracks steering dangerously close to the MOR singer-songwriting territory of Jack Johnson. Hugh Montgomery Various Beyond the Horizon (Warner Jazz) \u00a311.99 The annual globe-hopping compilation from writer and broadcaster Charlie Gillett is a showcase for both headline stars and obscure gems. It's no surprise, then, to find tracks from stars like Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Orchestre Baobab, Israels Yasmin Levy or Uzbek diva Sevara Nazarkhan, but the oddities are often as arresting. Here's a reggaematic Romanian love song from Germany and the yearning tones of Australia-based Tartar singer Zulya. Beautifully sequenced, the 34 tracks from 28 countries make clear that the world's music (not world music) is increasingly hybridised and perennially fascinating. Neil Spencer Houston Person &amp; Ron Carter Just Between Friends (High Note) \u00a312.99 Although it comes in the slightly forbidding format of duets for tenor saxophone and bass, this set encapsulates so many core values of jazz that I, for one, find it irresistible. In the first place, both players are real masters of their respective instruments and both are so mature that they have no need to show off with technical fireworks. Second, they approach each of these 10 standards with affection and understanding, revealing its inner beauty. Person's unfashionably warm and fibrous tone and Carter's woody resonance are captured to perfection by the great sound man Rudy Van Gelder.
