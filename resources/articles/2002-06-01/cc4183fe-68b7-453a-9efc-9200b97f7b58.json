If the idea of the equivalent of Hugh Grant bawling 'Eng-er-land' at viewers gives the impression that South Korea has no history of football culture, locals beg to differ. Legend has it that a version of the game called chukguk was first played 1,500 years ago, when noblemen assembled teams to kick around a fur-covered ball of rolled cloth. Fast-forward to 1882, and when British sailors from the Flying Fish left a football on a pier near Incheon (one of the World Cup venues) the seeds for today's tournament were sown. They were the first Asian team to qualify for a World Cup finals (in Switzerland in 1954), just one year after the end of the Korean war, but the six-day journey was so arduous, and the experience of playing on grass so unfamiliar, they lost their two games by an aggregate score of 16-0. Subsequently, although they progressed enough to establish themselves as their continent's most competitive side and are about to participate in their fifth consecutive World Cup, they have never won a single match in the finals. All that, according to the legions of fans, is about to change. The main reason why Koreans do not fear the worst is Guus Hiddink, coach of the Holland team who crushed South Korea 5-0 at the last World Cup. Since his arrival 18 months ago he has worked a near miracle in giving his new charges a basic knowledge of total football. The public were dubious of Hiddink's methods at the start. In experimenting with more than 50 players - often omitting golden boys in the process - and deliberately testing the team against top-level opponents, results were predictably painful. Hiddink worked relentlessly at toughening up his players, both physically and mentally. When he first arrived they were deferential, much to his irritation. He encouraged them to believe in themselves and think for themselves, a shift in attitude that has inspired tremendous results. A run of seven unbeaten World Cup warm-ups turned the tide of opinion, before the real watershed came with a 3-2 loss just before the start of the competition. But it was France. And the much-admired reigning champions, who had swatted them 5-0 a year previously, were rocked by Korea's fight and finesse until a last-minute decider. Hiddink, having worked wonders, is now held in awe. An economic research institute published an analysis of his leadership skills to use as an example for CEOs of major companies. The Dutchman was voted 'Most Suitable Husband' material in a poll of Miss Korea contestants. A radio presenter suggested the country's constitution should be revised so that naturalised Koreans could run for presidency. 'And Hiddink', they urged pointedly, 'should acquire Korean nationality'. Koreans have not always shown overt passion for the national team. Cha Bum Kun, the country's greatest player and export who played 10 years in the Bundesliga, recalls how mild clapping was about as euphoric as it got. 'People don't say \"I love you\" in our culture,' he explained. On a recent edition of a Korean-style Oprah , guess how many of 30 husbands admitted uttering those three affectionate words to their wives? None. World Cup fervour is getting the better of customary restraint though. Even watching training, fans shriek in deafening adoration of the 23 players charged with the mission to catapult Korean football towards new heights. Membership of the two official supporters' groups is growing by the day. Cheering practice may seem manufactured but the atmosphere created during the friendly against France as the entire stadium at Suwon chorused in unison was apparently so spine-tingling that the man from L'Equipe exclaimed: 'If Korea have this atmosphere they can beat anybody!' The stirring performance against the French infused the Korean fans with dizzy expectations. One single victory, so far elusive, is no longer enough. The slogan 'Second Round' has been plastered all over billboards in major cities. The incentive has captured everyone's imagination. A Seoul department store will give 1,000 shoppers gift vouchers worth a million won (\u00a3550) if the team advance from the group. Restaurants and even hospitals are doing similar - presumably with different prizes. For a country crushed by economic crisis in recent years, the party Korea is throwing for World Cup is little short of a sensation. Having paid off their debts to the International Monetary Fund ahead of schedule, they ploughed $2billion into creating 10 first-class stadiums. Mountains more won were found to build new roads, widen bridges and expand the subway system to develop an infrastructure to help the World Cup to run smoothly. On a more personal level, some taxi drivers have been trained in basic English, and others have had mobile phones installed that link directly to translators. People have promised not to hang laundry outside to tidy the place up. Half the cars in host cities will be left at home on alternate days to restrict pollution. The Koreans are obsessed with what foreigners think of them. With 400,000 international visitors expected to sample South Korea's delights during the tournament, they know they will never have a better opportunity to introduce themselves. Ordinary folk are making an enormous effort and their warmth has left a lasting impression before their team have even had the chance to etch themselves into World Cup history. About 64,000 Koreans offered their services as volunteers (three quarters too many than were needed). They came from far and wide, and are not just the usual mass of students. A dapper 55-year-old gentleman wandered over to introduce himself. He is Shin Chun-Jae, and his story symbolises how strongly Koreans feel about doing their bit for the World Cup. Having emigrated to Canada 16 years ago for a 'better life', he felt obliged to return to volunteer. 'Like most Korean people I am proud of my country. For a long time my country was poor and it needs to grow up. What better opportunity. I want this to be successful and that's why I have to help.' Will this surge of goodwill in the name of football have a lasting effect once the tournament is over? What, for example, will become of the stadiums? Half of them are in cities that don't even have a professional team and the government think-tanks have been set up to work out what to do next. The domestic game is still in its infancy here, with the K-League not yet 20 years old and its 10 teams, all but one owned by industrial companies (Hyundai owns three), attracting crowds far outstripped by baseball. The average is in the region of 7-8,000. The quality of foreign players lags some way behind the J.League: Japan lured Zico, Korea managed Dalian Atkinson. On the field, they are hopeful that the World Cup will inspire new generations of future stars, and the Korean FA are establishing a new approach to youth development with that in mind. As for the current stars, this World Cup is seen as a gateway to opportunities at high-profile European clubs. One of the most talented performers, Choi Tai-Uk, expressed his willingness to play in the Nationwide Second Division if it will help him get to Manchester United eventually. The incentives to impress in this World Cup are huge. After six years preparing themselves for this moment, South Korea are as ready as they will ever be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
