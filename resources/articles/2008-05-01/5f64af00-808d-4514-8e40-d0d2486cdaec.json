The Portugal international hugged the touchline to receive the sort of crossfield pass that has stretched defences all season. By maintaining width he helped create space inside for United's talents to prosper. On the other flank Park Ji-sung did his job efficiently and tucked in narrowly. He contributed little on the ball but was important tactically before being replaced by Ryan Giggs. The early minutes showed no sign of pacts between the clubs and, when a Jason Koumas shot was pushed away by Rio Ferdinand, there were even claims for a Wigan penalty. Park tucked in narrowly for United and Koumas did the same for Wigan. He and Wilson Palacios started well for the home side and United were forced to compete, Ronaldo hitting the chalk to create space, although it was Wayne Rooney who forced his way through and won a penalty for Ronaldo to convert. Paul Scholes was sending the ball to Ronaldo at every opportunity but was lucky to stay on the field when, already booked, he blocked Palacios. Oh Mr Bennett! Scholes, more than any other United player, spread the ball wide and accurately to Ronaldo. Although Maynor Figueroa was confident on the ball he was tentative in defence. At times he got caught overcovering; at other times he closed too tightly on Ronaldo. United showed more zest in the second half, forcing Michael Brown and Palacios deeper. When Wigan moved the ball forward Marcus Bent found difficulty keeping possession against Nemanja Vidic and Ferdinand. Wigan needed a herculean effort from their forwards but Emile Heskey, by his high standards, was cruising in second gear at times. United dominated possession but, strangely, when news came through of Chelsea's lead, Wigan surged and United appeared to become less aggressive. Owen Hargreaves came on for Scholes in the last quarter but United still pumped the ball wide to Ronaldo. The game was stretched now and with so much midfield space there was a need for simplicity. United provided it. Rooney turned with the ball and Giggs sped between Titus Bramble and Figueroa, who was caught too wide, to score United's killer goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
