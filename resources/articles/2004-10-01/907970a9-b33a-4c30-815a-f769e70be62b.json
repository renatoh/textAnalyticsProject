The deal is expected to take the manager to 2008, giving him two full seasons at the club's new 60,000-seat stadium. Wenger's announcement came alongside the confirmation of Emirates as the new \u00a3100m sponsors of the club for the next 15 years. The partnership provides the airline with the naming rights to the new stadium at Ashburton Grove while also giving it headline shirt sponsorship for eight seasons from 2006-07, when the company's current contract with Chelsea will have expired. The deal yields \u00a372m for Arsenal between the beginning of next season and 2012, with a further \u00a318m from 2013 to 2020 and additional bonuses according to team performance. \"The contract is going very well, especially with the money coming in,\" quipped Wenger, whose existing agreement runs to the end of this season. \"I've said many times that I am committed to a future with the club and in a question of days we will announce an extension of the contract. It will be for a few years. [The delay] is not a money problem, it is a question of details made on both sides, by my lawyer and those at the club.\" The sponsorship funds will permit Arsenal a smooth transition during the move to their new ground, ensuring there is no adverse impact on Wenger's transfer budget. The Frenchman was, though, defensive at the suggestion that the funds will help draw top talent to the club. \"The best players are first attracted by the way we play football and they feel they can reach the targets they want to achieve here,\" said Wenger. \"The fact that such big sponsors are interested is because they feel we are moving in the right direction.\" The club's decision to offer naming rights at all has been met with angry reaction by a number of fans who consider its legacy to have been sold out. There was some sympathy from Peter Hill-Wood, who took over the chairmanship from his father Dennis. \"There will be people who say that [we are selling out] and I would be one of the first,\" he said. \"I have been here many, many years but this is a very good sponsor who are paying a lot of money.\" Arsenal will begin repaying their long-term debt of \u00a3240m when they move into the Emirates Stadium in August 2006. Though the loan is currently set at a punitive 7%-per-annum interest rate, the board will look to set more manageable repayment terms. \"I think [the sponsorship sums] exceeded our expectations,\" said Arsenal's managing director Keith Edelman. \"We will be indebted for the next seven years but the highest peak of debt is when we move to the new stadium, and then it reduces. This secures our revenue streams throughout that period. \"We will probably review our financial position shortly before the move. It is our intention to refinance the existing debt over a longer period of time.\" Edelman added that without the move to the new stadium, a sustained downturn in the champions' on-pitch performance would have led to a reduction in Wenger's resources. \"In [Highbury] stadium, Arsenal could not have survived extremely well if it was not in the Champions League for two successive seasons, we would have had to contract our wage bill,\" said Edelman. \"In the new stadium, we can do that and still invest as much money in the team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
