L. Hewitt It's no surprise that Hewitt is the favourite after destroying Pete Sampras to take the US Open in September. However two factors weigh against him becoming the first home player since Mark Edmondson in 1976 to win the Australian Open. First, how well has he recovered from his recent bout of chickenpox? Second, Hewitt's record in Melbourne isn't great - he's never gone past the fourth round. Bookies' odds:10-3 2. G. Kuerten If Hewitt's record is poor in Melbourne, Kuerten's is shocking. In five trips to the Australian Open he's never got past the second stage. Kuerten's not a bad hard-court player though and should do better this time around, especially as he's got an easy draw. But for a winner, look elsewhere. Bookies' odds 16-1 3. A. Agassi Like here, for instance. Agassi has a brilliant record at Melbourne, winning the title three times in his six visits. Whether the 2000 and 2001 winner can make it three-in-a-row depends heavily on whether he's spent his off-season in training or looking after his new baby, Jaden Gil. Being drawn in the same quarter as Sampras, Roddick and Safin won't help his chances though. Bookies' odds 5-1 4. Y. Kafelnikov Dour but dependable, Kafelnikov will steadily work his way through the first week before being out-gunned by a big server. In the easier half of the draw, but don't expect him to repeat his 1999 success this year. Bookies' odds 12-1 5. S. Grosjean A potential dark-horse. Reached the semi-finals last year and seems to like Melbourne: he also inspired the French team to Davis Cup victory at the back end of last year. His lack of inches - he's only 5ft 9ins - could weigh against him at the crunch, however. Bookies' odds 14-1. 6. T. Henman A potential winner? Well, stranger things have happened. Henman's record in Melbourne isn't brilliant - he's never got past the last sixteen. However his relationship with coach Larry Stefanki is clearly working, and if he carries over the form he showed in winning the AATP last week he could come close. Bookies' odds 20-1 7. T. Haas Haas is, amazingly, joint-fourth favourite despite an indifferent record in Grand Slams and against the top players. Should be good enough to make it through an easy draw before Hewitt blasts him out in the quarter-finals. Bookies' odds 12-1 8. P. Sampras Critics have been writing Sampras off ever since he lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon. He vowed to bounce back at the start of 2002, but looked woefully short of form losing to Todd Martin in the AATP. He's still a threat, but with Agassi, Safin and Roddick waiting for him in his quarter of the draw, at some point he's likely to wilt in the Australian heat. Bookies' odds 12-1 9. M. Safin The Russian was supposed to be the next big thing after winning the 2000 US Open, aged 20, but suffered a poor 2001. Showed signs of recovery at the back of the year though, reaching the semi-finals at Flushing Meadows. If that continues, he has all the attributes to win in Melbourne. Tough draw though, Bookies' odds 10-1 10. G. Ivanisevic The fast surface will suit him, but don't bet on Ivanisevic repeating his astonishing Wimbledon triumph. Could be another seed to go out early, perhaps to Jerome Golmard in round two. Bookies' odds 66-1 11. R. Federer Of all the young players coming through, Federer has the best all-round game. Showed genuine class in beating Sampras at Wimbledon, although went off the boil slightly after that. Still, he's only 20 and will be expecting to break into the top ten this year. Could even do it by beating Hewitt who's in his quarter. Bookies' odds 25-1 12. G. Canas 2001 was a breakthrough year for 24-year-old Canas. After five years as a journeyman on the ATP tour he suddenly shot into the top 16 after finishing with a 45-21 win/loss record. That good form has continued in 2002, with victory in India. He's a clay-courter at heart, but victory over Kafelnikov at Wimbledon showed he can play on the quick stuff too. One to watch. Bookies' odds 33-1 13. A. Roddick Which brings nicely onto Andy 'A-rod' Roddick. It's only a matter of time before the 19-year-old wins a Slam. Not beyond the bounds of possibility that he'll win the Australian Open at his first attempt, a la Agassi in 1995, but will probably have to overcome Sampras, Agassi and Hewitt to do so. Bookies' odds 14-1 14. A. Corretja Corretja is a rare breed - a Spaniard who can serve and volley. He was ranked as high as second in the world back in 1999, but never shows that form at Melbourne - he's only once got past the second round in five visits. Bookies' odds 100-1 15. A. Clement Reached the final last year before being blown away by Agassi in three one-sided sets. Would be a major surprise if he got that close to a Slam again, but should still be around for the second week. Bookies' odds 40-1 16. T. Johansson Big-serving Swede is another with a poor record at the Australian Open - in seven visits he's crashed out in the first or second round on five occasions. Has the game and the draw this year to do much better. Bookies' odds 66-1 17. C. Moya Runner-up in the 1997 Australian Open. Decent bet to make the last 16. Bookies' odds66-1 18. A. Portas After seven years as a professional, Portas has finally broken into the world's top 20 at the sprightly age of 28. He has no record at the Australian Open to speak of though. Bookies' odds 125-1 19. J. Gambill In four attempts Gambill has never got beyond the first round at Melbourne. That should change this time round, though he faces a tricky third-round match against Roddick. Bookies' odds 66-1 Other seeds 20. F. Santoro Bookies' odds: 100-1 21. Y. El Aynaoui Bookies' odds: 66-1 22. H. Arazi Bookies' odds: 100-1 23 N. Lapentti Bookies' odds: 50-1 24. T. Enqvist Bookies' odds: 25-1 25. A. Pavel Bookies' odds: 80-1 26. J. Novak Bookies' odds: 100-1 27. S. Schalken Bookies' odds: 80-1 28. G. Rusedski Bookies' odds: 66-1 29. X. Malisse Bookies' odds: 66-1 30. N. Escude Bookies' odds: 50-1 31. A. Vanciguerra Bookies' odds: 100-1 32. T Robredo Bookies odds 100-1 One to watch: Tommy Robredo Last year - his first full year on the men's tour - the 19-year-old Robredo finished as the second youngest player in the top 30. Originally unseeded for the Australian Open, the withdrawal of 5th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero gave the Spaniard the number 32 spot. With a straightforward draw, and a winnable match against Kafelnikov in the third round, Robredo could be one to keep an eye on in Melbourne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
