The company, which has faced years of heated criticism for paying very little tax in the UK, reported on Thursday that its European, Middle Eastern and Asian business (EMEA) paid $23.6m (\u00a318.3m) in tax on $230m of royalty payment earnings in the year to the end of September 2018. Starbucks EMEA, which collects royalty income from 38 countries from Norway to Morocco, said it paid \u201can effective tax rate of 23.7%\u201d \u2013 above the UK\u2019s corporate tax rate of 19%. At the same time, Starbucks EMEA sent $448m to its global headquarters in Seattle. The money is being brought back to the US following president Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ctax holiday\u201d on overseas earnings. The big dividend payment is part of Starbucks\u2019 plan to \u201crefocus on maximising total shareholder return\u201d and will result in a windfall for shareholders, including Howard Schultz, the company\u2019s billionaire founder and former chief executive, who owns 3% of the shares. In the UK, where there are about 1,000 Starbucks stores, the company paid just \u00a34m of tax to the exchequer despite raking in \u00a3387m in sales. Starbucks said it paid such a small amount of tax because it made a \u00a317m pre-tax loss in the UK. The loss comes after paying out \u00a375m in \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d, which includes royalty payments of \u00a327.4m. That means that Starbucks UK is paying about seven times more in royalty payments than it is paying in tax. Martin Brok, president of Starbucks EMEA, said: \u201cDoing business in EMEA continues to be challenging for Starbucks. From the changing consumer landscape to high rents and political uncertainty, there are ongoing pressures across the region. \u201cWhile our 2018 figures show that we have made progress \u2013 boosted primarily by a large one-off gain from the deal signed with Nestle last May \u2013 our UK business recorded a loss in spite of a similar top line performance. \u201cStarbucks announced its refreshed global strategic priorities in 2018 to refocus on maximising total shareholder return. To that end, the EMEA business received dividends from its regional subsidiaries of $148m and paid dividends after tax to its ultimate parent company, Starbucks Corporation, of $448m.\u201d Starbucks said it had paid $74m in tax in the UK since relocating its EMEA headquarters to London in 2014, following public and political outrage over how little tax Starbucks paid in Britain. In 2012, it was revealed that Starbucks had paid just \u00a38.6m in taxes on \u00a33bn in UK sales since 1998, when it launched its first UK coffee shop. George Turner, director of Tax Watch UK, said: \u201cThe relocation of Starbucks regional HQ to London has clearly resulted in some additional tax payments to the UK, but there are still big questions over the company\u2019s tax affairs in Europe. \u201cThe UK has in recent years moved to a territorial tax system where we only seek to tax profits generated from operations in this country. The exemption on dividend income is part of this and makes the UK a very attractive location as a regional HQ for US companies. \u201cStarbucks claimed that the large profits being recognised in their UK-based European HQ arise from dividends on which tax has already been paid overseas \u2013 but where that tax was paid, and how much, is as clear as the coffee on which those profits were made.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
