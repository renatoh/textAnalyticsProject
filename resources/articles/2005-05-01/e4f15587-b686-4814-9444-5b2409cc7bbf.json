For both Athletic and me it would be difficult to say no to an offer like this. Chelsea are reported to have offered between \u20ac14m (\u00a39.6m) and \u20ac18m (\u00a312.4m) for the defender and would pay him a salary of up to \u20ac3m, more than three times what he earns at Athletic. Del Horno's agent Jokin Barcena is reported to have been in London this week for talks with Chelsea. Del Horno, a powerful attacking left-back who is strong in the air, is under contract to Athletic until 2007. He came up through the youth ranks at the club and has caught the eye for his fine performances for the Basque side when they have played against Real Madrid, scoring five goals against them in the last four seasons. He made his debut for Spain last September in a friendly against Scotland and has now won six caps and scored two goals, including the winner against England in November. In Seoul a depleted Chelsea side proved more than a match for one of Asia's best sides. A burst of speed from Joe Cole produced the only goal to beat Suwon Bluewings in an exhibition match that was as much about sponsorship as football. Chelsea signed a $96m (\u00a352.6m) deal last month with the South Korean electronics giant Samsung, which owns the Bluewings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
