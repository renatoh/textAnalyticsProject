West Bromwich Albion fans would have said she was right until a couple of weeks ago but now Brown Ideye is one of the hottest players in the Premier League. Ideye\u2019s mother feared that through football he would be lured into the drug culture of their home city Lagos in Nigeria and she banned him playing for two years, even sending him away. Now, after four goals in seven days for West Brom that have turned around both his life and his career, Ideye talks about what happened. \u201cBack then, most of the guys playing football in my street weren\u2019t good guys,\u201d he says of life when he was 14 years old. \u201cThey smoked crazy things, took drugs, they were always pissed \u2013 they were the bad boys of the area. She said: \u2018No, you can never play football, you have to go to school, you have to get something better out of life, not football.\u2019\u201d Ideye is talking at Albion\u2019s training ground, at ease now with the club record \u00a310m fee they paid for him, his dreadful start when he mostly sat on the substitutes\u2019 bench, getting only an occasional bit part in games, and the two goals in five months that left him condemned as a flop. Albion were willing to take a \u00a36m loss and shove him out to al-Gharafa and the desert of Qatar last month but Ideye, with his pride and reputation battered, refused to go. Ideye has his father\u2019s name, Joel, and 1936-2001, the years of his life, tattooed on his right arm but you suspect there is a lot of his mother\u2019s determination in his character. \u201cThere was one day I sneaked out of the house and my mother was inside when she heard some neighbours shouting my name,\u201d Ideye says. \u201cThey were calling out: \u2018Come on, come and see what your son is doing.\u2019 \u201cShe thought I must be doing something wrong so she came running out and the neighbour called her into the living room and told her to sit down and watch the TV. And there I was on television, playing football. My mother found it very strange because she had asked me to go out and do something for her and there I was playing football on the TV.\u201d It was a televised youth cup final that Ideye\u2019s team won but the medal would not be enough protection against his mum. \u201cI told the coach he had to come back with me because when I got home they were going to beat me up,\u201d Ideye says. \u201cSo my coach apologised to my mum and said he had sneaked me out. He said he was very sorry about it. That\u2019s when my mum gave me her blessing and said: \u2018If you want to play football then why don\u2019t you just go play football?\u2019\u201d Now she is his biggest fan. The Premier League is huge news in Nigeria and she watches his games. \u201cThey only show the English Premier League back home,\u201d Ideye says. \u201cWhen I was with clubs in Switzerland, France and Ukraine she could not see me, so she is always having a cheer now. One time I was playing and she was screaming. My brother sent me the video. It was really nice seeing her and that focus on me.\u201d He is the youngest of four sons and three daughters, and his mother sent him to her sister\u2019s home to keep him away from football, drugs and bad influences. \u201cIt was so I wouldn\u2019t be dragged into that life. Those boys, they were in the same team as me. During daylight they played football but nights, they do crazy stuff. That\u2019s how people see them, don\u2019t let your children mingle with this set. Mum was just trying to protect me. She had wanted me to go to school but I wanted to be somebody everyone wanted to see. I wanted them to be pointing their fingers and shouting: \u2018That is Brown Ideye.\u2019\u201d He has scored goals wherever he has been: Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax (23 in 55 games), Sochaux (17 in 52) and Dynamo Kyiv (33 in 74), plus five in 24 Nigeria internationals. But as a Baggie, apart from one goal against Hull in the Capital One Cup and another that came off his back in the home league defeat by Manchester City, he had been barren. Alan Irvine could not get Ideye to score and lost his job; the new manager, Tony Pulis, wanted Ideye out and Carlton Cole in but could not get the deals done, so Ideye stayed \u2013 and scored. There was one at Burnley in a 2-2 draw, another against Swansea in a 2-0 win and two last weekend against West Ham in the FA Cup. Ideye has made West Brom\u2019s relegation struggle less acute and they are in the Cup quarter-finals for the first time in seven years. They play Sunderland away on Saturday when it might have been al-Gharafa, seventh in the Qatar Stars League, away to al-Sailiya on Friday. \u201cThe club has the right to buy and sell who they want, but I just said to myself that I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not lying. I had this strong belief that this time would come. I scored against Burnley, but you can see my reaction, I was not happy. It was after the game with Swansea I really knew that this is me. \u201cThat night I went home, turned off my phone and prayed to God to thank him for this moment. It\u2019s what I have been waiting for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
