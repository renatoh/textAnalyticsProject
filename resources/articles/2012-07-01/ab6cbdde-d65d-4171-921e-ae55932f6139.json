Following the addition of a middle distance runner, Gareth Warburton, who won his place on appeal at the end of last week, the 542-strong British team for the London Olympics was yesterday the first of 203 to be officially approved by the International Olympic Committee. Team GB chef de mission Andy Hunt said they were all \"ready to deliver\". The team, which will be augmented by 519 support staff and 300 volunteers, is the largest in over a century and ensures that Team GB will be represented in every one of the 26 Olympic sports. The British Olympic Association, which has promised to deliver \"more medals in more sports than in over a century\", is spending \u00a313m to support the team during the Games. The number of competing athletes has been boosted by Britain being able to take up \"host-nation places\" in a number of sports, including handball and volleyball. Team GB's youngest athlete selected to is 15-year-old artistic gymnast Rebecca Tunney, while the oldest is 56-year-old dressage rider Richard Davison. Alongside the likes of Ben Ainslie, who is aiming for his fourth gold medal at consecutive Games and also has a silver, and Sir Chris Hoy, hoping to add to his four golds and one silver in the velodrome, will be hundreds of first-time Olympians. Three Team GB athletes will be competing at their sixth Games: Alison Williamson in the archery, Mary King in the eventing and showjumper Nick Skelton. The British team will also include more female athletes than ever before, with a 48\u201352 gender split in favour of men. In the wake of a string of controversial selections, Hunt paid tribute to those who had missed out. \"Their disappointment is a testament to the great strength in depth developed across many Olympic sports in the UK. Through their talent, commitment and determination, they have pushed their colleagues on to greater heights and can take heart in knowing that they have played a crucial role in helping to deliver Team GB success this summer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
