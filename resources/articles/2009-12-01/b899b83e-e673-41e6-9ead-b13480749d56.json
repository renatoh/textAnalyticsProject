He's here, he's there, he seems to be everywhere in his home borough, usually armed with his camera to help illustrate his copious critiques of London-wide cycling policies and his local Council's environmental policies in general. No doubt many in the latter administration consider him unreasonable, unfair and perhaps ungrateful too, but I can assure him that he's got their attention. He recently ran a series of typically erudite and disrespectful posts about LBWF's proposed traffic improvement schemes for various parts of the borough. I intended to draw your attention to them at the time, and apologise for failing miserably to do so. They haven't gone out of date, though: see here and here and here. Somewhere in a notebook I've jotted the Council's defence of the schemes, and I promise to post its side of the story in the New Year. For now, as Jamesons gets just slightly the better of journalistic detachment, let me say that London needs more hyper-active, hyper-local bloggers like Freewheeler. A Merry Christmas to him and, of course, to you too, dear readers. Now, where's the Sellotape gone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
