Vanessa arrived on the shopfloor posing as Julia, a recent divorcee, and explained her camera-entourage with the rather flimsy backstory that she was the subject of a documentary about people who had been out of work for a long time. She did an incredibly good impression of someone unused to the world of work, hanging her head and effin and jeffin softly after what could not have been more than six hours. By the middle of the week, she'd lost her voice. A shop assistant called Mae saw through her cover as good as straightaway, and asked for more details about her divorce. Her husband was really unfaithful, all the time. \"And if you don't mind me asking, why are you wearing a wig?\" \"I don't want him to recognise me,\" she muffled back. She might be the worst liar I've ever seen on television. If you're going to laugh at lines such as \"this rampant rabbit has seven settings that will fetch you to ultimate pleasure\"; and at this description of hoax calls \u2013 \"it's always either heavy breathing or they'll come on and ask us how to remove an anal sex toy\", well, then you will have laughed quite a lot. \"I think it's pretty childish, to be honest,\" said the sweet-faced Ellie, after a group of men stood round her, sniggering about anal probes. \"And I'm at least five or six years younger than them.\" There were staff members who thought central office had it all wrong. Laura, especially, couldn't work out why they stopped selling the gimp masks and the \"harsher\" restraints \u2013 \"they're forgetting the fact that they have a licence,\" she said, indignant, as if she'd walked into an offie that only sold Schloer and Curly Wurlies. But what Vanessa ultimately discovered, which she could have done more easily by a pass through her own company guidelines, was that the staff aren't treated that well. It's nothing major, it's not enslavement, nobody's eating gruel or docked wages for toilet breaks. It's just small things that make a big difference to a small income, the cheese-paring practices of the post-unionised workplace. The women who stage Ann Summers parties have to supplement their case of products \u2013 which they have to rent in the first place \u2013 from their own pockets, if they want to make sales. The shop assistants are never offered full-time work; only the managers work full-time. When the Golds called everyone in and revealed Vanessa's true identity, it was meant to be a tearjerker, as they made real all the shop assistants' dearest dreams. Laura got to be a brand ambassador, which is quite a big deal, although I wonder if anybody knows what it means. Ellie got to be mentored by Vanessa (\"this is how to be the owner's niece; this is how to be the CEO's daughter; this is how to be the CEO's sister; this is how to apply lipliner; and that's how I got to the top!\"). And if you think that is lame, Mae got to \"share [her] ideas with the buying team\", and also a VIP day to watch Blackburn play West Ham (she has a disabled son who is a big Blackburn fan). Having drawn an hour's worth of attention to the difference between the top and the bottom, it didn't do anything like enough to redress it. Worse, most of the responses were a bit lukewarm. Ellie managed an underpowered \"ooh\", when they gave her a week's holiday in Greece, and then said: \"But I haven't got a passport!\" It's not because the girls weren't grateful; it's just because the English are useless at instant, lavish displays of pleasure. Which is lucky for the Golds, otherwise we wouldn't need rampant rabbits in the first place. True Stories: Voices From the Killing Fields (More4) was neither a history of the Khmer Rouge, nor a reflection on the infamous killing fields: rather, it was the personal journey of Thet Sambath, a journalist who, in his spare time, travelled the country, interviewing the henchmen of the revolution. At one point, he had a man mime the way he slit throats; it was a horribly evocative, jumpy moment, not least for Sambath himself, who lost his parents and brothers to this holocaust and spent his childhood orphaned and on the run. He seemed to doubt his own strength for a moment, then continued on his quest. One had the strong impression that, however many stories he gathered, it would never be over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
