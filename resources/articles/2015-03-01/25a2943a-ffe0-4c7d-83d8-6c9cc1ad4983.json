It is why, for example, Emre Can represents Exhibit A in the Liverpool manager\u2019s theory and not a threat to his Champions League ambitions on Sunday. Can is the standout success of Liverpool\u2019s \u00a3117m transfer spree last year or, to use Rodgers\u2019s words, the \u201cRolls-Royce\u201d of a player picked up for \u00a39.8m from Bayer Leverkusen. The 21-year-old was also on David Moyes\u2019s list of potential young recruits for Manchester United until the Scot\u2019s departure after 10 ill-fated months closed the route to Old Trafford. The Germany Under-21 international had not helped his prospects with two inauspicious Champions League performances against United while Moyes was still in charge, the second coming when Ryan Giggs orchestrated a 5-0 home defeat for Sami Hyypia\u2019s Leverkusen two days shy of his 40th birthday. \u201cI played very badly against them,\u201d says Can, left-back that night at the BayArena and keen to avoid a repeat at Anfield. The admission comes with a smile. He, and Liverpool, know too much can be read into auditions. Can did not complete a game for Rodgers\u2019s team until 29 December as he adjusted to the demands of midfield in the Premier League. An ankle injury suffered on international duty also affected his start and, despite opening the scoring against Chelsea in November, he was back on the bench for the next 10 matches as the manager sought a solution to Liverpool\u2019s weak form. When criticism of the club\u2019s \u201ctransfer committee\u201d followed, Can\u2019s name was invariably mentioned. \u201cMy attitude was not to moan or make a big fuss about it but to keep calm and work hard so that when I got the chance at half-time against Burnley I could break into the side and stay there,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI feel very good at the moment, in good shape, and I feel I have the trust of the manager. I believe I am doing a good job and that is why I am playing, so I am happy.\u201d Can has been a permanent resident in the team since that 1-0 win at Turf Moor on Boxing Day, aiding Liverpool\u2019s dramatic transformation into the in-form Premier League team of 2015 and vindicating the single-minded approach that saw him turn his back on Bayern Munich at the age of 19. \u201cI left Bayern because I needed the game time,\u201d the versatile midfielder explains. \u201cIt was not an easy step and some people might not have seen it as a step forward because I was going to a smaller club [Leverkusen] but for me it was the right step to do that. If I keep doing what I have been doing for two or three months I am sure they might regret me leaving one day but I want to make clear that I have nothing at all against Bayern. They gave me lot of good things, a good education and it was my decision to leave. I wanted more game time, so there was no bad blood with Bayern and I thank them for all they did for me. \u201cIn the long term I think my decision will increase my chances of playing international football. Without being disrespectful to Leverkusen, playing for Liverpool helps me more because I am playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world and I have no regrets making this step. It is very similar here to Bayern. The level was very high under Jupp Heynckes with a lot of passing exercises and training specific to the position you play. It\u2019s like that here.\u201d One of the few obstacles the Frankfurt-born player has encountered since moving to Merseyside is the language barrier. He was bemused to find himself described as \u201clike a Rolls\u2011Royce at the back\u201d for Liverpool when reading coverage of the Merseyside derby in February, for instance, but given the quote came from Rodgers he put two and two together and made vier. \u201cWhen I first heard about it I wondered what it could mean,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t use that expression in Germany. We wouldn\u2019t say something like that. But obviously I know a Rolls-Royce is a big luxurious car so I thought it must be positive, even though I didn\u2019t know exactly what it meant. I hadn\u2019t heard the comparison before but I thought that in football terms there must be a positive association and it can\u2019t be a bad thing if the manager is saying something like that. I understand what it means now.\u201d Rolls-Royce claims its vision is to provide \u201cbetter power for a changing world\u201d and in that context the simile suits a player who has flourished since being introduced to Liverpool\u2019s rejigged defence on Boxing Day. Potentially world class and able to \u201cplay in any team in world football\u201d in a couple of years are also among the Liverpool manager\u2019s tributes to Can, although there appears little danger of the flattery causing complacency. He responds: \u201cI am proud a manager of the status of Brendan Rodgers spoke about me in this way but I know there is a long way to go and I need to keep on doing my best to get there one day. I need to keep on working.\u201d He is less enamoured by comparisons to Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger, however, two compatriots whose impact for club and country Can has been tipped to emulate. \u201cI am a completely different player to Ballack and Schweinsteiger,\u201d he says. \u201cI admire the careers they have had and hope I will have a career like them but I want to go my own way and build a career for myself and to be known as Emre Can rather than another Ballack or Schweinsteiger.\u201dIt is a measure of Can\u2019s impact, his composure on the ball and willingness, as Rodgers said, \u201cto do the dirty work as well\u201d that he has been mentioned as a possible future captain of Liverpool after only 24 starts. That may have to wait depending on Jordan Henderson\u2019s contract situation or who is recruited when Steven Gerrard leaves this summer, but Can already resembles one of the leaders that Rodgers craved for the team. His popularity at Anfield will rise further on Sunday should Liverpool overtake United in the scramble for Champions League qualification. Can was an unused substitute when Louis van Gaal\u2019s team inflicted Liverpool\u2019s last defeat in the Premier League in December but is integral to their prospects now. \u201cVan Gaal does a good job wherever he is,\u201d says Can of the former Bayern coach. \u201cBut I would definitely back Liverpool to beat them to a top-four finish.\u201d Beyond this season, Can\u2019s aim is to secure a place in Liverpool\u2019s midfield. He explains: \u201cIt\u2019s fine for me in defence. The most important thing first of all was to break into the team, regardless of the position. Over the long term it is definitely my ambition to play in the midfield. I always have a drive to take me forward offensively wherever I am playing. The fact I am playing in the back three at the moment means there is no player behind me and I have the whole game ahead of me. There is space for me to bring the ball forward and I have the drive to go forward. I am enjoying it. We are a young team that needs to keep improving, because then there will be good years ahead.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
