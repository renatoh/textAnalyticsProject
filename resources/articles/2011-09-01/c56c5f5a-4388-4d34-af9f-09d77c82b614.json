Increases for main board directors in FTSE 100 companies in 2011 are typically between 2.5% and 7.5%, with a median of 4%, according to research by accountants Deloitte, while FTSE 250 rises average 3%. The numbers suggest that the pay gap between company directors and their staff has widened in the latest round of salary rises. Directors' settlements were well above the average private sector pay awards of 2.5% reported by Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, in August. Wages for workers are lagging inflation, which reached 4.4% in July, as measured by the consumer prices index. Stephen Cahill, partner in the remuneration team at Deloitte, said: \"It is not surprising that after a two-year period of widespread pay freezes there has been a return to pay increases for executive directors. What has surprised us is the number of salary increases above 5%, which is significantly above inflation and the increase in average employee earnings.\" Cahill said that remuneration committees should boost directors' salaries only where there was a \"real, compelling\" reason to do so, and in general any increases should be limited to general workforce settlements. Bonus payouts rose from 71% of maximum in 2010 to 87% in 2011 for the 100 largest firms. For the FTSE 250, bonuses leapt from 54% of maximum to 86%. Under most bonus schemes, a maximum pot is reserved at the beginning of each year and payouts depend on performance. Cahill added: \"There is a strong argument for a recalibration of both targets and expectations to ensure that these payouts do not, in effect, become almost guaranteed.\" Over the past 10 years, bonuses have averaged between 70% and 80% of maximum. Bonus pots have remained at between 150% and 100% of salary, meaning that many directors need only deliver a run of the mill performance to double their salaries. The remuneration of Britain's best-paid executives is coming under intense scrutiny. The government is reviewing executive pay mechanisms and transparency, with proposals due before Christmas, while recent reports cite research compiled by Thomson Reuters Datastream which showed that one in five FTSE 100 companies paid their chief executive more than they paid in UK corporation tax last year. Deloitte recommends allowing deferred or unvested awards to lapse in the event of gross misconduct or mis-statement of results. It also says that more directors should hold shares. In the top-performing companies, chief executives hold a median of 11 times salary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
