The second part of the CRE's formal investigation into racism in the prison service, published today, identified 14 areas of failure in the management of Feltham young offenders institute, west London; Brixton prison, south London; and Parc prison in Brigend, south Wales. The investigation made 17 findings of unlawful racial discrimination, the majority of which concerned individual cases in the three prisons. These findings, together with the CRE's earlier inquiry into the death of a young Asian inmate battered to death by his racist cellmate, led it to conclude that the prison service failed \"to deliver equivalent protection to all prisoners in its care and to deliver race equality in the way it employed staff or treated prisoners\". The 14 areas of failure uncovered by the commission during its two-and-a-half year inquiry include racist cultures among prison staff, which meant race equality procedures were ignored while bigotry was tolerated; racist taunting and intimidation of ethnic minority staff; not protecting prisoners from racial harassment; and the transfer of inmates who complain about racist abuse to prisons with a reputation for harsh regimes. The CRE also found that internal prison investigations into racial discrimination were generally of poor quality and hardly ever upheld complaints; prison staff discouraged or prevented prisoners from making complaints; unauthorised punishments were more likely to be imposed on ethnic minority prisoners; and black male inmates were over-represented in the prison disciplinary system. The CRE chairman, Trevor Phillips, criticised prison managers for failing to tackle racism. \"What's most shocking about this report is that, despite numerous wake-up calls, prison service managers persistently failed to tackle racism in their institutions and that very often they also failed to implement their own policies on racial discrimination, abuse and harassment,\" he said. Mr Phillips welcomed a fresh commitment by the prison service to implement an action plan agreed with the CRE to deliver racial equality throughout the prison system. This aims to improve policies, standards and performance and review employment, staff development and training. \"I recognise the progress made by the prison service since our formal investigation was launched and I am confident of the commitment and determination of current management to stamp out racism in all parts of the service.\" He cautioned that the task of eradicating racial discrimination was \"considerable\", adding that the CRE will closely monitor the prison service's progress. Phil Wheatley, director general of the prison service, said: \"Our commitment to race equality will not stop at mere compliance with the law. I want to go beyond that. \"I am determined that we will build excellent race relations into all our work and bring about the cultural changes necessary to create fairness and equality in all we do.\" Mr Phillips also highlighted concern about the disproportionate growth in the number of ethnic minority prisoners in England and Wales. \"One in four prisoners is from an ethnic minority, compared with one in 11 among the whole population in England and Wales. And worryingly, this disproportion is growing,\" he said. \"Between 1999 and 2002, the total prison population grew by just over 12%, but the number of black prisoners rose by over 50%. This is therefore an issue that we cannot afford to ignore.\" The CRE published the first part of its inquiry into racism in the prison service in July, which focused on the murder of Zahid Mubarek at Feltham YOI in March 2000. The 19-year-old was bludgeoned to death with a table leg by his psychopathic skinhead cellmate, Robert Stewart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
