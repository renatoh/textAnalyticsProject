Thieves broke into the store of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, which undertakes excavations and research and educates the public about archaeology, twice last week and once over the weekend. As well as the beads, large quantities of coins and metal artefacts, and an assortment of bone objects have been stolen. The charity has put on an appeal asking the public to look out for the historical items being offered for sale. The trust\u2019s outreach and archive manager Dr Andrew Richardson told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty distressing for everyone at the trust, not only because of the lost items but also the scale of the damage. \u201cThey actually smashed their way through an exterior wall which contains asbestos so we\u2019re having to get a specialist company in to fix it. They also cut through water and electric pipes.\u201d He said that due to \u201cchaos\u201d caused by the break in, it\u2019s been difficult to ascertain exactly what has been taken but he estimates about 1,500 individual items are missing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take hours of work trying to work out what has gone missing. It will be a big job and we\u2019ll probably have to draft in volunteers.\u201d He added that the police were called and officers have been in to take forensics and that more security has been put in. The thieves also raided the charity\u2019s educational loans collection and stole replica metal axes, pins, coins and other items, including a plaster bust of Queen Victoria. They also stole more than \u00a31,000 worth of tools. In an email from Richardson, shared online by archaeology news website thePipeLine, he said: \u201cOur best chance of recovering some or all of the items is to spread awareness of the thefts far and wide, in the hope that things will be recognised when the thieves try to sell the items.\u201d Richardson also said the metal coins and artefacts were from under Canterbury\u2019s Whitefriars shopping centre, which they had excavated prior to construction. The bone objects were from a range of sites most notably the Beaney \u2013 a Grade II listed building in Canterbury, which is now a museum, library and art gallery. He added that the beads came from various cemeteries. The trust is currently undertaking excavations at St Albans Cathedral and at Slatters Hotel in Canterbury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
