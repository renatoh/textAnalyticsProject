I have endowment with Abbey Life of \u00a382.14 per month and an interest-only mortgage with Alliance &amp; Leicester. I have received a forecast that says there is a high probability that my endowment will not be enough to pay the mortgage at the end of the term. Would it be best to sell the endowment and pay the money off on the interest-only loan and carry on putting the \u00a382.14 per month as a repayment on the mortgage, or keep the endowment going and take a chance? I am 61-years-old and, as a result of receiving conflicting advice, do not know the best thing to do. CE A You are right in saying that simply keeping the endowment going would involve taking a chance that your mortgage won't be repaid in full at the end of its term. And in answering your question I assume you don't want to take that chance. But to be absolutely sure of being able to pay off the mortgage in full, you need to sell your policy for at least \u00a322,115. I have worked this out by taking your current loan of \u00a330,000 and subtracting the amount that, if you kept it, you would have paid off by diverting \u00a382.14 per month for eight years. That is, \u00a330,000 minus \u00a37,885 (\u00a382.14 multiplied by 12 months multiplied by eight years). The \u00a322,115 figure also assumes that you would subsequently use the proceeds from selling the policy to reduce your mortgage. However, that calculation doesn't take into account the fact that by repaying a chunk of your loan, the amount of interest you will pay will also go down, so even more of your current mortgage repayment could go towards clearing the loan. So you may not need your policy to fetch as much as \u00a322,115. Therefore I suggest that first of all you find out what you could sell your policy for by asking the Association of Policy Market Makers. Then, subtract this amount from your current loan of \u00a330,000 and ask your lender how much you would need to pay each month if you converted the reduced amount to a repayment mortgage. If the monthly repayments were equal to or less than your current monthly repayment plus \u00a382.14, selling your policy would seem to make sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
