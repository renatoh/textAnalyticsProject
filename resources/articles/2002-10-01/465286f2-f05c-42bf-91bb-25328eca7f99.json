Promotion in his first season and fourth place last year suggested the good times were on their way back for his Millwall team. But defeat by Birmingham in last season's play-off semi-final seems to have halted their progress. This season the Lions have already lost three home games, failed to keep a clean sheet in five matches and are 20th in the table. Fans are staying away, too, but McGhee is philosophical. \"I know I'm mortal because of what happened to George Burley [sacked by Ipswich],\" he said. \"Absolutely any manager who is in the bottom half of the table will feel anxious. I can't do anything about that. \"The crowd are restless. I'm doing the best with what I've got. My chairman will not jump on the bandwagon. If the last throw of the dice means changing the manager, then clubs will do that.\" McGhee cited the absences of Steven Reid and Richard Sadlier,who because of injury have not played this season, and Tim Cahill, who will miss the rest of it, as reasons for Millwall's poor start. Without their creative influence and lacking funds for replacements it is no wonder the Lions are failing to roar. Millwall's captain Stuart Nethercott, who signed a new contract last week, gave Wimbledon the lead when he nudged Jobi McAnuff's cross past his own goalkeeper, Tony Warner. But Millwall's equaliser also came from the former Spurs defender, heading in Christophe Kinet's cross. \"It wasn't a quality game whatsoever,\" said McGhee, understating somewhat. \"The teams showed exactly why they are where they are in the table.\" Wimbledon's sights are set lower this season and, despite this being a derby, only 75 of their fans made the journey. \"The situation is not ideal but I can't do anything about it. We can't ship 5,000 fans in,\" said Stuart Murdoch, whose team,with McAnuff demonstrating his huge potential, showed great spirit. How long the 20-year-old winger will remain at the club remains to be seen. Man of the match : Jobi McAnuff (Wimbledon)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
