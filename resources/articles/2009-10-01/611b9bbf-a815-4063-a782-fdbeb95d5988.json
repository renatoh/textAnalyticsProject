The metatarsal fractures suffered by David Beckham before the 2002 finals , in South Korea and Japan, and Wayne Rooney before Germany 2006 dominated the build-ups. Both players duly lacked match fitness when selected by Sven-Goran Eriksson but Capello stressed yesterday that his entire 23-man squad for South Africa must be fully fit. That might trouble Ferdinand more than most, given that today he starts an England game for only the third time in a year, against Ukraine, having been blighted by back, thigh and calf problems. Indeed the Manchester United centre-half has played only 14 of the last 40 competitive games for club and country. Asked whether he would protest at being omitted from the final party if that patchy injury record were to be maintained, Ferdinand said: \"No, it's only right for [Capello] to do that. This manager is very black and white. In the past we've gone into tournaments umming and ahhing on too many players. But this manager doesn't work like that. \"If you're carrying an injury, there'll be a doubt whether you'll get on the plane. There have been distractions over the last few World Cups, whether they've been injuries or other things, but this manager will keep things football orientated and won't allow anything like that. No one in the squad has got enough credit in the bank to guarantee he'll be picked. \"When you drop out of the team you don't want the person who replaces you to have an absolute stinker, but you don't want a player to come in and do better than you either. That's the truth. This manager has said if you're good enough you'll play whether you've got one cap or 80 caps.\" Ferdinand, 30 next month, described the various injuries that have limited his recent impact as \"freakish\", arguing that they are not an indication of long-term fragility. \"I've never had a period like this before in my career,\" he said. \"Each injury has been different. I haven't had a problem with my back since last season; there was my calf and I pulled my thigh muscle in training on the day before the start of this season. \"But I've been doing a lot of maintenance work, making sure my posture is right and correct. Simple things that are very effective. I'll be doing everything possible to make sure I get on that plane [to South Africa].\" This evening's game at the Dnipro Arena will test Ferdinand's fitness and this team's motivation. Ukraine have arguably given England their toughest competitive match under Capello's management \u2013 three of the team's seven bookings in qualification came in the tight 2\u20111 victory at Wembley in April \u2013 and, while passage to South Africa may have been guaranteed with eight successive group wins, Capello is intent on maintaining momentum. \"They've been training very well, very hard, but now I want to see them play,\" the Italian said. \"This is a really good test to understand what happens when we have to play and it's not really important to win. For me it's really important to win this game. I'm putting them under pressure [to win]. I don't know whether they feel that. We will see. I hope so. But I don't like to play any games without intensity and courage.\" Ferdinand added: \"We still need to improve every aspect of our game. We couldn't go into the tournament now and expect to win it. The time we have with the manager before the finals will be so important. You will hopefully see improvements after we spend that time in his company, when he can drill us properly. We've not been with this manager long enough to think there's nothing left to learn. We have to sponge up every bit of information we can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
