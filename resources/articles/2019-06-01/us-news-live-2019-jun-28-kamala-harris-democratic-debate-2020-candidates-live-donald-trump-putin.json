Here\u2019s a rundown of the day\u2019s biggest stories: Donald Trump tweeted an unexpected invitation to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, asking him to meet for a handshake in the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean peninsula. A major LGBTQ political group gave Pete Buttigieg his first major endorsement. Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy declared his support for impeaching Trump, bringing the number of House Democrats who back impeachment to 81, according to the Hill. Elizabeth Warren pledged not to give diplomatic posts to wealthy donors if she becomes president. \u201cTrump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons,\u201d Warren wrote. The acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said border crossings are on track to drop 25% from May to June, at a press conference this afternoon. This drop was expected because border crossings usually drop in the warmer summer months. Joe Biden addressed his exchange at the debate with Kamala Harris about his past comments about segregationist senators. \u201c30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can\u2019t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\u201d Biden said. Trump\u2019s latest attempt at Twitter diplomacy with Kim was issued just about three hours after the White House released a much more formal statement regarding his visit to South Korea. In that statement, the White House stressed that the visit to the Republic of Korea (ROK) was designed to \u201creaffirm a vital partnership that is essential to our economic and security interests\u201d and discussed the negotiations with North Korea. President Trump is working closely with President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to achieve the final and fully verified denuclearization of North Korea and to establish a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula ... The United States and ROK coordination and cooperation regarding the denuclearization of North Korea is the strongest it has ever been ... Both President Trump and President Moon have repeatedly called on Chairman Kim to follow through on his commitment to completely denuclearize. The statement makes no mention of an attempt to hold a meeting in the DMZ during Trump\u2019s visit. President Trump just proposed a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the Korean peninsula between north and south. Trump will be in South Korea meeting with that country\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in. The bizarre missive suggests that Trump is leaving the planning of such a high stakes meeting to the whims of chance, and that the only agenda would be to shake hands and say \u201cHello(?)!\u201d Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced any agreement about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. A federal judge has ordered the US government into mediation over concerns about the treatment of children being held in border patrol facilities, Reuters reports. The judge\u2019s order follows a request by lawyers representing detained children for an emergency order to send doctors and health experts into the facilities. The treatment of migrant children held in detention is governed by a decades-old agreement known as the Flores agreement. The parties will have to report back to the judge by 12 July on the status of conditions in the detention facilities. Another report out today, by Bloomberg, states that children and their mothers are complaining of hunger in one federal detention center center in Texas. Bloomberg reviewed procurement data for the facility and found that the menu was unhealthy, lacking nutritional value and fresh ingredients. Rafael Perez-Escamilla, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, called the menu \u201cappalling\u201d. Toby Elizabeth Gialluca, a lawyer with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, visited the facility in early June and said mothers alleged they were mostly provided with formula and potato chips to feed their toddlers. Other staples include cereal bars, ramen noodles, bologna sandwiches and microwaveable burritos. Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the menu \u201ca monotonous, unhealthy and disrespectful diet\u201d. Victory Fund, the largest LGBTQ political action committee in the US, just endorsed Pete Buttigieg for president. The announcement comes on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riot that galvanized the fight for civil rights for LGBTQ people in the US. The group\u2019s core mission is to increase the representation of LGBTQ people in American politics by supporting the campaigns of openly LGBTQ candidates. This is the first time the group has endorsed a presidential candidate. \u201cEvery day that Pete is in the race, from the standpoint of an LGBT activist, he transforms American politics,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Annise Parker, told the Daily Beast. \u201cAs long as he is on that debate stage, LGBTQ issues can never be put on the backburner.\u201d Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco taking over the live blog to see you through to the weekend. It\u2019s not exactly your standard political live blog fare, but since everything is political now (nb the discount furniture site whose employees walked out over sales to immigrant detention centers), it\u2019s probably worth mentioning that the US women\u2019s national team just dispatched France 2-1. The victory comes thanks to two goals by star midfielder Megan Rapinoe, whose outspoken politics and promise not to go to the \u201cfucking White House\u201d have drawn the ire of Trump. Another House Democrat, Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy, is backing impeachment. That brings the amount of House Democrats who back impeachment to 81, according to the Hill. Elizabeth Warren has pledged that if she were to become president, she would not follow the traditional practice of giving diplomatic posts to wealthy donors. \u201cTrump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons,\u201d Warren wrote. The acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said border crossings are on track to drop 25% from May to June, at a press conference this afternoon. This drop was expected because border crossings usually drop in the warmer summer months. Joe Biden just spoke at an event in Chicago, addressing his exchange at the debate with Kamala Harris about his past comments about segregationist senators. \u201c30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can\u2019t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\u201d Biden said. In a 50 to 40 vote, the Senate voted in favor of an amendment to a Defense bill that would require congressional support before Trump acts. The vote was still short of the 60 needed for passage. But with four Republicans backing the amendment, members of Congress said it reflected skepticism about Trump\u2019s possible intervention in the Middle East. At the moment, Trump is only beholden to war authorizations Congress approved in the aftermath of September 11th. The House is expected to take up the issue next month. \u201cA congressional vote is a pretty good signal of what our constituents are telling us that another war in the Middle East would be a disaster right now, we don\u2019t want the president to just do it on a whim,\u201d said senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, who co-authored the measure with Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico. Kaine continued: \u201cMy gut tells me that the White House is realizing this is deeply unpopular with the American public.\u201d Even though the measure failed to reach the 60 votes needed, the House will likely try to attach its own limits on military action in Iran with its Defense bill next month. Of the ten candidates on stage last night, entrepreneur Andrew Yang clocked the least amount of speaking time at two minutes and 56 seconds. \u201cI really would have loved more questions and more air time, but I\u2019ve got three more bites at the apple,\u201d Yang said after the debate. \u201cThe American people just found out a little more about me tonight.\u201d He did manage to advocate for a plan that would give $1,000 per month to all citizens over 18, but because of the stunted debate format, he didn\u2019t have time to explain it. Yang told the Miami Herald that the stipend would cost the government about $3.2 trillion per year, would be paid for by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a value-added tax of 10%. \u201cWhile it seems like a lot of money, it\u2019s actually more affordable than you\u2019d think,\u201d he said. Yang also claimed his microphone was \u201cnot on\u201d a few times when he attempted to speak, but the debate host, NBC, denied that assertion. \u201cAt no point during the debate was any candidate\u2019s microphone turned off or muted,\u201d an NBC spokesperson said in a statement to reporters. It\u2019s Sarah Huckabee Sanders last day as White House press secretary, which means it\u2019s a good time to read this piece by our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, about how the role of press secretary diminished under Trump. During Sanders\u2019 tenure, the once daily ritual of the press briefing \u2013 must-watch television in the chaotic era of Sean Spicer \u2013 was essentially supplanted by the president holding court with reporters in the Oval Office, the cabinet room and, above all, on the White House South Lawn, competing with the roar of his Marine One helicopter. The more he talked, the more pointless Sanders\u2019 briefings became, since she merely parroted his tweets, evaded serious policy questions and channeled her boss\u2019s anti-media barbs. It was perhaps inevitable that the briefings would get shorter and finally wither away, symbolised by a recent photo that showed dust literally gathering on the lectern. This morning, 2020 Democratic candidates visited the Homestead children\u2019s detention shelter in Florida. Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, John Hickenlooper, Kirsten Gillibrand and Marianne Williamson were denied entry to the facility, but made remarks while standing outside. Juli\u00e1n Castro, speaking in Spanish and English, said: \u201cHe should have immediately reached out to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, to partner with them so more people could find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States. Instead of that, he has wasted two and a half years.\u201d Joe Biden just spoke at an event in Chicago, addressing his exchange at the debate with Kamala Harris about his past comments about segregationist senators. \u201c30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can\u2019t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\u201d Biden said. At the debate Thursday night, in response to a question about race and policing, Harris interjected and said that she had a right to respond as the only black candidate on stage. She directed her comments to Biden, denouncing his record on race. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris said, looking directly at the former vice-president. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Speaking at a labor luncheon on Friday, Biden said: \u201cFolks, the discussion in this race today shouldn\u2019t be about the past. We should be talking about how we can do better, how we can move forward, how we can give every child in America an opportunity for success stories.\u201d Another House Democrat, Massachusetts representative Joe Kennedy, is backing impeachment. \u201cThis is not a decision I made lightly, nor is it one to celebrate,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dark day for our country when its Commander-in-Chief is accussed of high crimes. But after reading the Mueller report in full, reviewing the facts and consulting with legal experts, I believe Congress has a responsibility to act decisively.\u201d That brings the amount of House Democrats who back impeachment to 81, according to the Hill. The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden, an environment reporter, said the Democratic debate last night demonstrated just how far the the US is from contemplating the climate crisis as a threat that will touch almost all areas of American life and policymaking: The discussion largely pigeonholed the climate crisis as a single issue and an environmental problem. And the crisis was not what most candidates \u2013 including ones with better climate credentials \u2013 listed as their top priority. Asked what first issue they would pursue from the White House, only Hickenlooper and the Colorado senator Michael Bennet, neither of whom have been polling strongly, responded with climate change. Sanders, who is considered a heavyweight in the field, refused to pick one or two issues. \u201cWe need a political revolution,\u201d he said. The acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said border crossings are on track to drop 25% from May to June, at a press conference this afternoon. This drop was expected, border crossings usually drop in the warmer summer months. Watch for Donald Trump and DHS attempting to connect this to their policies. When a reporter asked if the drop was related to seasonal changes, McAleenan said the change was not just seasonal. If you would like to watch the full 21 minute press conference, it\u2019s here. Here\u2019s a look at what was an unfortunately fairly routine morning in US politics, circa 2019. Former US president Jimmy Carter ignored the unwritten rule for former presidents of not attacking the current president by saying he didn\u2019t think Donald Trump was a legitimate president. \u201cHe lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,\u201d Carter said. The acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency that deals with the administrative aspects of immigration, has blamed a migrant father for the drowning deaths captured in a widely circulated photo. The acting USCIS head, Ken Cuccinelli, is not popular with Republicans, Democrats or USCIS employees and will face a difficult confirmation process. One thing missing from the Democratic debates? Puerto Rico. It was mentioned exactly once in the four cumulative hours of debating. Donald Trump joked with Russian president Vladimir Putin about both getting rid of journalists and Russian meddling in US elections. Also: Elizabeth Warren has challenged her fellow Democrats running for president to commit to not giving ambassador posts to political donors, a common practice. She said diplomatic posts must not be sold to \u201crich buffoons.\u201d Her campaign posted a proposal of this and other changes to the State department on Medium on Friday, including doubling the size of the foreign service by growing programs to train people for jobs in that field and improving diversity in the pool of people going for those jobs. \u201cThe Pentagon is nearly 40 times bigger than the State department \u2014 we employ more people to work in military grocery stores than we do foreign service officers,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThat has real consequences.\u201d It\u2019s not super flashy, though Warren\u2019s argument for making diplomatic positions more professional is a direct hit at Trump. Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons... His South Africa nominee is a handbag designer. In all, Donald Trump has appointed political cronies to nearly half the available ambassadorial positions \u2014 far more than any president in recent memory. As a result, opportunities for career professionals are severely limited. The practice of auctioning off American diplomacy to the highest bidder must end. At the event where former president Jimmy Carter questioned the legitimacy of Donald Trump\u2019s election, Walter Mondale, who served as vice president under Carter, also criticized Trump, saying \u201che\u2019s got something deep in him that is detestable.\u201d It is unusual - very unusual - for a former president to criticize a sitting president. Carter has even praised some of Trump\u2019s decisions before and in April they spoke by phone. Carter is the oldest living president at 94. We might not hear Trump\u2019s reaction until tomorrow because he\u2019s at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where it is 1:30am. In two, two-hour debates featuring 20 presidential hopefuls, Puerto Rico was mentioned exactly once. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, mentioned Puerto Rico in response to a question about the climate crisis. Hurricane Maria devastated the island, a US territory, in September and October 2017. The US response to the hurricane was severely criticized as Puerto Ricans faced weeks without electricity and were stranded without access to food, water or medical care. The official death toll is 2,975 people, a number Donald Trump has repeatedly denied. He also continues to complain about providing aid to Puerto Rico while simultaneously lying about how much money the island has received from the US. The New York Times Miami bureau chief, Patricia Mazzei, on last night\u2019s debate: Jared Rizzi, a political podcaster, said: It would be an egregious error not to spotlight the debate performance of author and lifestyle guru, Marianne Williamson, who very fortunately/unfortunately will probably never be in a position to debate Donald Trump. He\u2019s talking about Trump (for reference: battery, windmill, cereal). Former US president Jimmy Carter said Trump is an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d at a conference for his Carter Center. Carter said a full investigation \u201cwould show that Trump didn\u2019t actually win the election in 2016,\u201d in comments first reported by USA Today Washington bureau chief, Susan Page. \u201cHe lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,\u201d Carter continued. The event moderator, Jon Meacham, asked if that meant Carter thought that Trump was an illegitimate president. \u201cBased on what I said, which I can\u2019t retract,\u201d Carter said. Ahead of its summer break, the US supreme court has announced what it plans to consider in its next term, according to Reuters: It will hear an appeal concerning the criminal convictions of two former associates of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal that hindered his 2016 presidential candidacy. The associates were convicted in 2016 of fraud and civil rights violations for realigning the lanes to the George Washington Bridge without telling local officials. It won\u2019t revive Alabama\u2019s ban on the most commonly used procedure in second-trimester abortions. Courts have blocked similar laws in Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. It will will consider reviving a Montana program that gives tax credits to people who donate to private-school scholarships. The state\u2019s highest court had struck down the program because it violated the Montana constitution\u2019s ban on state aid to religious organizations. It agreed to hear a case about billions of dollars awarded by a court to victims of the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 200 people died in the attacks and more than 1,000 were injured. 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren and George Conway, husband of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, are among the first to criticize Donald Trump for joking with Russian president Vladimir Putin about both getting rid of journalists and Russian meddling in US elections. Twenty-six journalists have been murdered in Russia since Putin first became president, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). And it is a year to the day since five Capital Gazette employees were killed in their newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. In June, the appointment of Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump immigration official who has blamed a migrant father for the drowning death of him and his child, was immediately challenged by senior House committee leaders in a letter to the acting Homeland security secretary concerned about Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment in June. The House leaders said they had \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the appointment, which they said circumvents rules about federal vacancies. Immigration groups immediately raised concerns about Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment because of his history of homophobic remarks and claim that \u201cwar powers\u201d could be used against immigrants. He also has ties to the anti-Muslim campaigner, Brigitte Gabriel. Earlier this month, Cuccinelli appeared to push USCIS staffers to lower how many people are approved in the first stage of the asylum process, a credible fear interview, according to a leaked letter published by Buzzfeed. The supreme court just announced it will review the constitutionality of an Obama-era program that allows undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children get temporary deportation relief and work permits. Trump ended the program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), but the decision was challenged in several lawsuits. The program protected about 700,000 people known as \u201cDreamers.\u201d The Washington Post reports: The judges who have blocked ending the program have said the administration could remedy the legal impasse by providing a detailed reasoning of why the program should be abolished. Instead, it has continued to combat the orders in court. The fight over the young people protected by the program \u2014 the average age is around 24 \u2014 has been a fierce battle between Trump and Democrats, who largely defend the initiative. Trump at times has said he would like to find a way to protect those in the program, but attempts to work out a political compromise over DACA have foundered amid the larger partisan debate over immigration and border security. The acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency that deals with the administrative aspects of immigration, has blamed a migrant father for the drowning deaths captured in a widely circulated photo. USCIS acting director, Ken Cuccinelli, blamed \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, 25, for the deaths of himself and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria \u2013 as the Trump administration faces criticism for failing to respond to the influx of families approaching the border. The Trump administration has favored policies meant to deter people from traveling north, which advocates say has in turn driven people to make more dangerous border crossings such as crossing the Rio Grande. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett asked Cuccinelli if the photo would become a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the border? Cuccinelli said no, \u201cin fact the opposite.\u201d The reason we have tragedies like that on the border is because that father didn\u2019t wait to go through the asylum process in the legal fashion and decided to cross the river and not only died but his daughter died tragically as well. Until we fix the attractions in our asylum system, people like that father and that child are going to continue to come through a dangerous trip. Cuccinelli has not yet been confirmed as head of USCIS, an agency that under Trump has become less about processing documents and more about immigration enforcement. Some details about Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia: He has said \u201cwar powers\u201d could be used against immigrants. \u201cYou just point them back across the river and let them swim for it,\u201d he said in 2018. In a 2012 interview, he made comments that some saw as comparing rats to immigrants. He has backed ending birthright citizenship. He has backed denying unemployment benefits to non-English speakers. In 2009, Cuccinelli said homosexual acts are \u201cintrinisically wrong\u201d and that LGBTQ people \u201cdon\u2019t comport with natural law.\u201d The president of the union that represents about 13,000 USCIS employees, Danielle Spooner, said appointing Cuccinelli \u201cspells the end of legal immigration as we know it.\u201d *This post was updated at 12:03pm to reflect that Cuccinelli said homosexual acts are \u201cintrinsically wrong,\u201d not that he thinks homosexuality is \u201cintrinsically wrong.\u201d While Kamala Harris is being praised for her performance in the debate last night, she is under pressure to clarify a muddled response to a question on health insurance from last night\u2019s debate. In the debate, Harris seemed to support abolishing private insurance in favor of government-run health insurance. This morning, she says she misunderstood the question and thought it was about whether she would give up her own private insurance plan for a government-run plan under Medicare for All. She said she doesn\u2019t support eliminating private insurance. Political journalists aren\u2019t convinced this is her end-all answer on Medicare for All. Hello, happy Friday and welcome to our daily live politics coverage. The first round of Democratic debates concluded last night after a two-day, 20-candidate extravaganza. California senator Kamala Harris was last night\u2019s definitive winner and today she\u2019ll be looking to maintain that momentum while others fight for attention. The president has also weighed-in, from Osaka, Japan: In Florida today, several 2020 candidates plan to visit the Homestead child detention facility, including Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper and Marianne Williamson. At the G20 summit, Trump just spoke to Russian president Vladimir Putin and made light of Russian election meddling. They also shared a laugh about \u201cgetting rid\u201d of journalists. More on that in a bit and rolling updates from the G20 by the Guardian\u2019s business team here. We\u2019ll have some analysis and reviews of last night\u2019s debate in the blog.
