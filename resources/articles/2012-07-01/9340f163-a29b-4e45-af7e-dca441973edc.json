Pietersen failed in an attempt to find a way back into the England team that will defend the world Twenty20 title in Sri Lanka this autumn after proposing a compromise to the England and Wales Cricket Board that involved him missing a Test against New Zealand next summer to allow him to spend longer in the Indian Premier League. Angus Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, helped to set up those negotiations between Pietersen's management and the ECB and he believes that lessons must be learned from what he concedes is now an \"impasse\". \"Some kind of process that introduces flexibility for those players who have been at the top for a good length of time is consistent with what everyone is trying to do,\" he said. \"We all recognise that with a really hectic schedule, managing player workloads is an important thing to do. In particular for the most senior players who have been at the top the longest and who play in all formats of the game we need to find a structure to develop England cricket as a squad game where you aim not only to win every game but you try to keep talent fresh and at the top for as long as possible. Linking back to KP, that was one of the things that he was seeking which struck a positive note with the ECB and we all want to work towards that goal.\" Porter envisages senior players, defined either as those who have won 100 caps in all forms of the game or are 32 or over, being given pre-arranged breaks. He also repeated a previous desire to create a window in the international schedule for the IPL. However, he acknowledged the major practical problems presented by the long-term broadcasting agreements that are already in place, and commit England to maintaining their hectic schedule. \"There are a couple of issues that we need to get to grips with and I will be discussing them as part of the next central contract negotiation,\" he added. That is due next year, hopefully to be concluded before the Ashes series, meaning there will be no change before the current central contracts are reviewed at the end of this summer. So the likelihood remains that Pietersen will be offered a deal to play Test cricket only, on considerably reduced terms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
