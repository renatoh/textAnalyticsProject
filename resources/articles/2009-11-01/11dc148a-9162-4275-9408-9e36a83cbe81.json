British government officials believe that the former prime minister could emerge victorious at the last minute because there is no consensus on a candidate among the EU's 27 leaders. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, who will chair Thursday's summit as part of his country's rotating presidency of the EU, is embarking on fresh consultations with the 27 leaders. Reinfeldt had hoped to present the leaders on Thursday with a list of three names for the three posts that are to be decided \u2013 the president of the European council, the EU's high representative for foreign policy and the secretary general of the European council. There was a growing acknowledgment tonight that Reinfeldt may fail to find agreement before the summit and that the decision could go down to \"coffee and mints\" at the dinner on Thursday night, as one observer put it. Cecilia Malmstrom, the Swedish Europe minister, said in Brussels: \"There are still more names than posts.\" Herman Van Rompuy, the Belgian prime minister, is still seen as the frontrunner for the presidency because he meets two criteria demanded by many EU leaders \u2013 he hails from the EU's dominant centre-right and he is the leader of a small member state. But Van Rompuy does not enjoy overwhelming support, keeping Blair's hopes alive. One British official said: \"There is no consensus. Blair is not dead. He still stands a chance.\" It is understood that Blair will allow his name to remain in play until the end of the process unless it becomes abundantly clear by the eve of the summit that he has no support beyond diehards in London and Rome. The former prime minister is said to be realistic about his chances. In a sign of the uncertainty over the process, Poland demanded that candidates for the two main posts of president and high representative appear at the summit on Thursday to present their credentials. Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, told a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels that the process needed to be more open. Many candidates will be in Brussels because they will be attending the dinner as EU leaders. It is highly unlikely that Blair would attend the summit unless he was to be appointed, because he is the only candidate who does not hold office. The uncertainty over the new posts, which come into force after the Lisbon treaty was finally ratified by all member states, means that the EU is heading for a classic round of horse trading. One factor in Blair's favour is the failure of the centre-left to find a credible candidate for the post of foreign policy high representative. This could go to a candidate from the centre-right \u2013 the former Hong Kong governor Lord Patten is being tipped in some circles, while the Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini could triumph at the last minute \u2013 possibly handing the presidency to Blair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
