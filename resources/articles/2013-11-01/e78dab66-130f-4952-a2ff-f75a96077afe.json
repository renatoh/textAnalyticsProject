The Old Bailey jury head that one message sent in January 2005 from Goodman to Coulson, the then editor of the Sunday newspaper, discussed a potential news story about injuries suffered by Prince Harry. Goodman told Coulson: \"The health inf[ormation] is from the doc himself, scammed from Helen Asprey, Harry and William's PA, so it's solid.\" The jury heard that the director of medical services at the English Institute of Sport, Dr Rod Jaques, had left a message for Asprey a day earlier, telling her that \"our mutual friend\" was now much better with his knee but continuing to have problems with his shoulder and foot. In his email to the editor on 22 January, Goodman suggested checking the story with the Clarence House communications secretary, Paddy Harverson. Six minutes later, the jury heard, Coulson replied, saying simply: \"He won't help will he?\" The following day, Goodman published a story referring to Prince Harry's wrenched shoulder and infected foot. The jury was told that prosecution and defence both accepted that Goodman and the tabloid's specialist phone hacker, Glenn Mulcaire, had intercepted hundreds of voicemails from royal phones. In April 2006, four aides had been hacked a total of 296 times, an average of nearly 10 royal hacks a day. In the context of the hacking of Harverson's phone, the Crown produced emails from 15 April 2006 in which Goodman sent the draft of a story about Prince William to the assistant editor, Ian Edmondson. Edmondson emailed back to ask: \"What about the line William says I was pissed but I wasn't that bad?\" Goodman replied: \"That's a bit too much knowledge to expose to a wider readership. Massively dangerous to the source ...\" In relation to the hacking of the Duchess of Cornwall's son, Tom Parker Bowles, the jury were shown an email from Goodman to the news editor, James Weatherup, written in February 2005 which apparently referred to an assistant editor, Greg Miskiw, who, the jury have been told, frequently assigned tasks to Mulcaire. Goodman's email read: \"Got a mobile \u2013 getting Greg to do a few dark arts.\" Weatherup replied: \"Don't know wot u mean ...\" The jury have been told that Miskiw and Weatherup have both pleaded guilty to conspiring to intercept voicemail messages and that Goodman was previously convicted of hacking into royal phones. Coulson and Edmondson deny conspiring to intercept phone messages. Earlier, the jury heard how glamour model Lorna Hogan was paid thousands of pounds by the News of the World to target celebrities in nightclubs. Hogan told the court that she had become pregnant by Calum Best, son of footballer George Best, and then sold two stories about their affair before allowing the paper to publish a picture from a scan of her unborn child. Hogan said she had worked for an agency called Supermodels, whose owner, Phil Green, \"arranged for girls to go to clubs, to be in a position to meet celebrities\" and she had a working relationship with the News of the World for \"some considerable time\", selling them stories for as much as \u00a310,000. One of the paper's reporters, Chris Tate, would drive to her house and pay her in cash, she said. During her two-month relationship with Calum Best in early 2006, she sold two stories which appeared in the paper in March (\"Lust like dad\") and April (\"I'm having Calum Best's baby\"), the court heard. She then had lunch with Edmondson, who, she claimed, had put pressure on her to sell a scan of her unborn child. When Best heard that she was handing over the picture, he texted her: \"How could you be so low to sell pictures of an unborn child?\" Hogan denied being paid for the picture. Best told the court that he had been paid \u00a32,000 by the paper for a story exposing an incident in a nightclub with Elizabeth Jagger, daughter of Mick Jagger, which she had not wanted to become public. He also said another story in the paper, about his problems with drugs, had been supplied without his permission by a friend of his father's wife in whom he had confided. The trial continues. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2013 to change \"scanned\" to \"scammed\" in the second paragraph"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
