There he caught the attention of Lyon but made only two appearances for the Ligue 1 club before a prolific loan at Le Havre, which prompted Mainz to pay \u20ac8m last summer. He scored 14 goals to propel them to safety and will provide France\u2019s firepower, alongside Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Marcus Thuram, son of the former defender Lilian. \u201cJP always wants to work,\u201d said Oswald Tanchot, his former coach. \u201cEvery morning, he would ask what he could do in addition to the day\u2019s training.\u201d At 6ft 4in, Mateta says his style is similar to Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Dani Olmo, Spain Age 21 Position Winger Club Dinamo Zagreb There are no Barcelona players in Spain\u2019s squad but in Olmo they possess a La Masia graduate. The Catalan joined Bar\u00e7a\u2019s academy from Espanyol aged nine but left at 16 for a clearer route to first-team football and has made more than 100 senior appearances. \u201cMy former teammates were first shocked and then they understood my decision to move was the right one,\u201d he said. He has won four league titles in five seasons in Croatia. A superb campaign, including 12 goals, culminated in Olmo winning the player of the year and young player of the year awards. Valencia, Milan, Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 and Bar\u00e7a \u2013 are reportedly keen. Phil Foden, England Age 19 Position Midfielder Club Manchester City After the Nations League semi-final there was a cry for a playmaker capable of transforming defence into attack for England; someone comfortable knitting together attacking phases, corkscrewing out of danger and pirouetting away from the opposition press. James Maddison, Mason Mount and Morgan Gibbs-White are gifted but there is a belief that Foden remains the country\u2019s crown jewel. Pep Guardiola said Foden \u201cwill be an important player\u201d for Manchester City \u201cfor the next decade\u201d and everything points towards him being at the heart of things for his country, too. Jonathan Tah, Germany Age 23 Position Defender Club Bayer Leverkusen Stefan Kuntz\u2019s reigning champions boast 1,310 Bundesliga appearances (and 83 goals), with Tah among the most experienced in the 23-man squad, having amassed more than 100 starts for Leverkusen. The 6ft 5in centre-back has been destined for big things since his Hamburg debut aged 17 but Leverkusen\u2019s sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller, said last year: \u201cHe has surpassed all expectation and now ranks as one of Germany\u2019s best defenders.\u201d Along with RB Leipzig\u2019s Lukas Klostermann, Tah has been on the fringes of Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s senior squad. Made his senior debut against England before being named in the Euro 2016 squad. Moise Kean, Italy Age 19 Position Striker Club Juventus Has drip-fed his stardust but no one doubts his quality. He is the most exciting teenager on the Serie A scene for years and it is sad that the embryonic stages of his career have been overshadowed by monkey noises and other racial slurs. Kean, born to Ivorian parents, admirably confronted the racists in Cagliari\u2019s Curva Nord and went on to score in consecutive games, including the winner against Milan. He joined Juve from Torino at 14 and made his league debut at 16, six months before becoming the first player born this millennium to score in one of Europe\u2019s top five leagues. He is at the forefront of a squad teeming with talent, including Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo, the Roma midfielder called up to the senior squad before making his under-21s bow. Luka Jovic, Serbia Age 21 Position Striker Club Real Madrid Real Madrid\u2019s new striker needs no introduction after a stellar season of 17 goals in the Bundesliga for Eintracht Frankfurt and another 10 in the Europa League. Quick, powerful and with an eye for goal that persuaded the 13-times European champions to shell out \u20ac60m, Jovic has scored twice in six appearances for Serbia\u2019s senior side but in the next few weeks in Italy and San Marino will form a potentially lethal attacking duo with his former Benfica teammate Andrija Zivkovic. Joachim Andersen, Denmark Age 23 Position Defender Club Sampdoria The towering defender has been turning heads in Italy with assured displays for Sampdoria\u2019s and is expected to recover from injury for Denmark\u2019s opening fixture against Germany. Andersen has a reputation as a ball-playing defender capable of launching attacks from deep in his own half with his excellent passing \u2013 attributes that have reportedly attracted interest from Arsenal. He and the Genk striker Marcus Ingvartsen will need to be at their best if Denmark are to reach the last four for the third time. Kevin Danso, Austria Age 20 Position Defender Club Augsburg Born in Austria to Ghanaian parents but raised in Milton Keynes from the age of six, Danso moved to Augsburg as a teenager in 2014 and has become a regular in the German top flight. He spent three years playing with Dele Alli at MK Dons but rejected approaches from England\u2019s youth sides in favour of the land of his birth and was rewarded with a first senior cap two years ago. Danso is comfortable in midfield but is expected to form a defensive partnership with the former Real Madrid player Philipp Lienhart. Austria\u2019s coach, Werner Gregoritsch, can call on three others with senior caps: Stefan Posch, Xaver Schlager and Hannes Wolf. Dodi Lukebakio, Belgium Age 20 Position Forward Club Watford The gangly winger spent last season on loan at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, where he scored 10 goals in 22 starts, including two against Bayern Munich. Lukebakio made one appearance for the Democratic Republic of the Congo three years ago in a friendly but switched to Belgium\u2019s youth sides after coming through Anderlecht\u2019s youth system. \u201cHe\u2019s so unpredictable with his pace and dribbling,\u201d Fortuna\u2019s coach, Friedhelm Funkel, said. Watford may call on him next season, depending on his performances with Belgium. The dark horses\u2019 other notable players include the striker Siebe Schrijvers and the 17-year-old midfielder Yari Verschaeren. Josip Brekalo, Croatia Age 20 Position Forward Club Wolfsburg Started Croatia\u2019s victory over Wales in the Euro 2020 qualifiers and has been tipped as the brightest of their new generation. Comfortable on either flank, Brekalo made an instant impact on his senior debut against Spain in November\u2019s Nations League meeting when he set up the winner before playing the second half against England. \u201cIt is an indescribable feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause one minute I was a hardcore fan, who always followed the national team on my feet with all my energy, sometimes out of control through emotions, and the next moment I am standing on iconic Wembley in front of the same people who I shared the stands with.\u201d Croatia also have the powerful Marseille defender Duje Caleta-Car, Everton\u2019s Nikola Vlasic and the former Barcelona player Alen Halilovic and could take some stopping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
