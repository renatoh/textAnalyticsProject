In other words the teams England's Swedish coach fields for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania will seek inspiration mainly from the hearts and diamonds of Manchester United and Liverpool. Half of the 26-man squad Eriksson announced yesterday evening are from Old Trafford or Anfield and at least half-a-dozen players from the two clubs are likely to face Finland at Liverpool on Saturday. For his first game as England coach, the 3-0 victory over Spain in a friendly at Villa Park a month ago, Eriksson used 18 players from an original squad of 31. In reducing the party by five for England's opening two qualifiers in foreign hands he has omitted, most notably, Sunderland's Kevin Phillips, who is still an outstanding finisher but has not repeated his prolific form of last season. Ugo Ehiogu, the Middlesbrough centre-back who delighted his old Villa fans by scoring England's third goal against Spain, has also been left out along with Arsenal's Ray Parlour, one of those forced out of that game through injury. Gareth Southgate, now playing again for Aston Villa, has been ignored by Eriksson which bodes ill for his future international chances. The team against Finland is likely to reflect the side that played the first half against Spain, after which Eriksson made seven changes. In all probability, therefore, Andy Cole will once more lead the attack with Michael Owen dropping off him, while Paul Scholes will operate in central midfield with David Beckham again used in his normal club position wide on the right. There will, however, be two important differences. Neither Steven Gerrard nor Steve McManaman was fit for the Spain match but both will surely perform crucial roles as England seek the World Cup points to repair the damage of a poor start to their attempts to reach next year's tournament in Japan and South Korea. Even now Gerrard's is a fragile talent. When Liverpool beat Porto 2-0 on Thursday in the Uefa Cup the power, speed and perception of this gifted 20-year-old midfielder recalled images of Alan Mullery. But Gerrard's muscular problems continue to make him a risk for two matches in four days and it was with reluctance that his manager, Gerard Houllier, brought him after 55 minutes as Liverpool sought salvation in yesterday's Premier League game against Derby. \"Steven has had some niggling injuries and he was not entirely fit,\" Houllier admitted. \"If I had played him for the whole match he would probably not have been OK to join up with England.\" Eriksson, then, now has to decide if Gerrard will be more use at Anfield on Saturday or in Tirana on Wednesday week. In all probability he will take the first option with Nicky Butt primed to take over against Albania. McManaman, has recovered from the knock which forced him out of the Spain game and is in good form on the left flank for Real Madrid. With Nicky Barmby ruled out through injury McManaman is virtually certain to fill a similar role against Finland and Albania. Beckham will, of course, keep the captaincy but with Gerrard and Scholes earmarked for midfield Eriksson is not going to rush into experimenting with Beckham in a more central role. In any case the Swede has already made it clear that he does not believe in using players out of their normal club positions. Emile Heskey was an exception to this rule in the Spain game when he came on after half-time and operated on the right wing. The role, however, is not alien to the big Liverpool striker who often moves wide and impressed Kevin Keegan when he did so against Argentina at Wembley. One of the most encouraging aspects of Eriksson's first squad for competitive games is that the younger bloods will feel their chance of World Cup experience is not far away. The West Ham midfield trio of Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard are still there along with Wes Brown, Jamie Carragher and Ashley Cole. Charlton's Chris Powell is no spring chicken but obviously impressed the England coach at Villa Park before he picked up a calf strain. With the inexperienced Ashley Cole the only other left-footed left-back in the squad - Michael Ball and Gareth Barry are in the England Under-21 party - Powell may well find himself an important part of England's World Cup aspirations; not bad for a 31-year-old who was once on loan to Aldershot. Eriksson's choice in goal may be simplified by the news that David Seaman has suffered a recurrence of a back injury. David James started against Spain but it was Nigel Martyn who saved a penalty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
