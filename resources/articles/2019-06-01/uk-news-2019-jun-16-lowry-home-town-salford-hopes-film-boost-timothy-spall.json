The 2014 film, Mr Turner, was partly set in Margate, and it brought the artist\u2019s vision of the seaside town to a wider audience, boosting its cultural status. Now Spall has taken on the role of another favourite British artist, LS Lowry, and residents of the painter\u2019s former home town, Salford, are hoping for a similar effect. \u201cSalford is increasingly a creative hub and Lowry\u2019s unique view of the city and the region still resonates locally and internationally. We are proud of that,\u201d said Salford city councillor Stephen Coen, who plans to install a series of lifesize Lowry-style steel figures in public locations. The artist, he feels, \u201ccaptured the working-class industrial heritage\u201d of the area. \u201cWe want to tap into our creative sector and bring aspects of his work to the public in various ways,\u201d said Coen. \u201cA silhouette walking to the Manchester United ground on the Trafford Road, perhaps, as featured in his painting Going to the Match?\u201d The Lowry gallery in the Quays, which features in the moving closing scenes of the film, Mrs Lowry &amp; Son, is also preparing for an influx of visitors. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about Mrs Lowry &amp; Son hitting the big screen and about the interest it will drum up,\u201d said Julia Fawcett, the gallery\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the producer to pay tribute to the film in our permanent exhibition, LS Lowry: The Art &amp; the Artist. Forty-three years after his death, Lowry continues to make headlines, be it multimillion-pound auctions of his work, a campaign to have him feature on the new \u00a320 bank note \u2013 to which he was pipped by Turner \u2013 or in this case the release of a major film.\u201d Adrian Noble, director of the film, believes Lowry\u2019s artistry still has the ability to change perceptions. \u201cYou see the world differently because of him,\u201d said Noble, a former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, this weekend. \u201cOne of the great functions of art is that it lets you look at things again. There is a kind of morality in the way Lowry does this.\u201d But will a second virtuoso performance as a painter from Spall really help people to recognise the beauty Lowry once saw in the city? The owner of the artist\u2019s former Pendlebury home doubts the council will act in time to capitalise. \u201cThey have not done anything so far. If you go to other towns they actually celebrate their famous people,\u201d said Steve Johnson, who lives with his family in the terraced Station Road house that Lowry once shared with his mother, Elizabeth, for 40 years. Johnson is raising funds for a bronze statue of the painter for his front garden. \u201cThere should be something to tell people about him and if the council won\u2019t do it, then we are trying to,\u201d he said. A heritage plaque outside the house was stolen a few years ago, but there is a statue of Lowry sitting on a bench in nearby Mottram in Longdendale, where he lived from 1948 until his death. The film, a screen adaptation of Martyn Hesford\u2019s play, also stars Vanessa Redgrave as Lowry\u2019s overbearing mother. It concentrates on the last claustrophobic years they spent together in the Pendlebury house they bought in 1908. A rent collector, Lowry studied art at night, tutored by the French impressionist Adolphe Valette. Once his disapproving mother had fallen asleep each night, he would go upstairs to paint into the early hours of the morning, using both ends of his brushes, his fingers and a limited palette of six colours \u2013 ivory, black, vermillion, Prussian blue, yellow ochre and flake white. \u201cHe is a riddle to me in many ways,\u201d said Noble, \u201cand the film does not try to entirely solve it. It\u2019s about the life of an artist. But I do try to develop the notion he found some artistic freedom in the attic and when he was walking about Salford.\u201d Elizabeth Lowry became depressed and bedridden after the death of her husband and Lowry cared for her until her death in 1939, just before his talent won recognition. \u201cOne of the attractions for me was this extraordinary story of someone so original and gifted, hidden from the world for such a long time,\u201d said Noble. \u201cHe was effectively in an abusive relationship that prevented him from sharing his art. He became almost a full-time carer and she quite consciously tried to stifle his talent.\u201d Born in 1887 in Stretford, Laurence Stephen Lowry spent his early years in some comfort in Victoria Park, Rusholme. But when he was 22 financial problems forced the family to move to Pendlebury. At first he said he \u201cdetested it\u201d, but this emotion later grew into a form of artistic obsession with the look of the people, the factories and the chimneys he now found on his doorstep. \u201cWe used some film trickery to show some of the views that inspired Lowry,\u201d said Noble. \u201cI moved the location of one or two things to where I knew I could create something authentic.\u201d Hesford grew up just streets away from Lowry\u2019s home and Noble believes the script has caught the cadences of the language of the area perfectly. He, too, would like to see more acknowledgment of the painter\u2019s unorthodox talent. \u201cA new plaque on the Pendlebury home would be a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are some vestiges of snobbery about Lowry still, especially in the art world.\u201d In the film Lowry\u2019s mother poignantly wonders who will remember that either of them existed, two lonely people, once they are dead and their house has been forgotten. The painter reassures her that it will all still be there, contained in his paintings. Mrs Lowry &amp; Son has its world premiere on 30 June at the Edinburgh international film festival and will go on general release in August.
