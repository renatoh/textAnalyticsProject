Todd Gurley had been troubled by a knee injury towards the end of the regular season but the Rams\u2019 head coach, Sean McVay, said his star running back was not an injury concern. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling good, 100%,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWe expect him to play a big role in this game.\u201d Gurley was not at his best in the NFC Championship game against the New Orleans Saints, gaining just 13 yards. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have that many touches, but he still played a good amount of snaps [against the Saints],\u201d McVay said. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t able to run it as much as we\u2019d like to, because New Orleans did a nice job stopping us. Then, we were in some two-minute situations at the end of the game and the end of the half where you\u2019re more inclined to throw it. He should be good. But I think really our team, as a whole, is feeling really good just having two weeks since our last game and looking forward to the challenge and competing to the best of our ability.\u201d Greg Zuerlein, whose 57-yard field goal sealed victory for the Rams against the Saints, was limited in practice earlier in the week but McVay was pleased with his fitness on Friday. \u201cHe felt good,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe hit the ball well. He hit the kickoffs and his field goals really well. That\u2019s kind of what we expected; that\u2019s what we hoped, and he\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d The Patriots\u2019 main concern this week had been linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower, who missed practice on Thursday through illness. New England head coach Bill Belichick said Hightower had been back to his best at practice on Friday though. \u201cHe did everything today,\u201d Belichick said of Hightower. \u201cYou could hear him talking out there, and that\u2019s usually a good sign with him. He has plenty of energy.\u201d Both teams will have a rest day on Saturday as they prepare for the biggest game of the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve been consistent where we try to stick to our message,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI just think this group is so tightknit. We kind of know what we stand for. We know what we need to do here. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any motivating words that I could say or anything else other than let\u2019s just continue to do the little things the right way, one day at a time, have a belief and confidence in one another, play for each other and we trust that good things will happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
