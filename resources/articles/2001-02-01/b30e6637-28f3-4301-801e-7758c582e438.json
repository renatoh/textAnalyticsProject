First, the $14 million Holy Land experience opened in Florida and walked straight into a barrage of righteous indignation. With the Ark of the Covenant recreated and a restaurant selling that no doubt wholesome sustenance the Goliath burger, this heaven on earth was met with an all-too-predictable fusilade of scorn from the Jewish lobby. The Nativity scene projected above the audience was denounced as offensive and the use of Christian imagery a 'perversion'. But of course, a dab of controversy never hurt a new start-up, did it? But on the other side of the continent, controversy was in short supply at the opening of California Adventure, the new extension to Disneyland at Anaheim. Disney doesn't do controversy; what it does is big numbers. This extension to Disneyland, which opened in July 1955, has cost a staggering $1.4 billion (for which you could just about get a Dome, give or take a golden handshake or two).The best-laid plans of mice and men, often go agley, however, and the Saturday before last week's opening everything went belly-up when the site had to be evacuated after a faulty amplifier in the Imax threw a hissy fit. The glitch was dismissed as being of little or no importance, but for such a billion-dollar investment to be jeopardised by a minor fault can have done little for the equanimity of the launch team. Those who fondly remember the foul-ups at the launch of our own benighted Dome may have felt the smallest kiss of a frisson that such a mighty organisation as Disney is not immune to the 'if it can go wrong, it will go wrong' school of cock-up. Be that as it may, California Adventure has 22 new shows, rides and attractions spread over 55 acres. As a paean to all things Californian, these are divided among three distinct 'themed lands' - Hollywood Pictures Backlot, Golden State and Paradise Pier. Crowning the Hollywood Pictures Backlot is the troublesome Imax, with its feature Soarin' Over California. Eighty-seven people at a time are lifted 40ft into the air inside a giant projection screen dome and all around is the stunning Californian landscape - the Golden Gate Bridge, the redwood forest, Napa Valley, Palm Springs, Yosemite National Park. And what's more, Disney's technical wizards ensure not only that you see California at its finest, but also that you experience the sounds and smells, too. Pretty nifty. There is also Golden Dreams, a 20-minute film celebrating the people and events that shaped the state. It features Whoopi Goldberg as the spirit of California. As someone who finds Miss Goldberg eminently resistible, I am perhaps not the ideal person to comment on the worth of this exercise. The Napa Valley is, of course, home to the Californian wine industry, which leads us on to the next area, Golden State. Here there is a restaurant devoted to Californian cuisine which features the wines of Robert Mondavi (yes, a real restaurant, serving real food, not ribs cooked in sump oil and liquorice). I think you'll find the merlot at $6 very potable. A minor gripe: for those of us who like good red wine, a good smoke is an essential accompaniment, but not at Disney, where smoking places are thin on the ground. Anyway, fortified by a glass or two of merlot, it's but a short step to It's Tough to be a Bug. Using the same technology as Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, it's an altogether wittier, wetter and smellier cinematic attraction, this time on insect life. Particularly beautiful is a stage curtain of red admirals that dissolves in an elegant fluttering of wings. Particularly unpleasant is having a large spider land on your bonce from out of the blackness. As for the bugs running along your seat... After the entrancing subterranean world of bugs, it's onwards and upwards to one of the new rides, Grizzly River Run, so called because the backdrop is a 110ft mountain carved in the shape of a grizzly bear. Touted as the world's longest and highest man-made river raft ride, it is also without doubt one of the wettest. Rafts which carry eight supplicants are racked up to the top of the mountain, spinning round all the while. And then good old gravity, with just a smidgen of help from Disney's imagineers, does the rest. Down and down and round and round you plummet through great gouts of white water, until you explode down the final 22ft drop. By this buttock-clenching moment you are so wet you don't care and, what the heck, around you go again. It's a superb ride which induces genuinely joyful high spirits. The two signature rides of California Adventure are found in Paradise Pier, a faithful recreation of a seafront pleasure ground, with boardwalks, fast-food outlets and handsomely evoked Fifties architecture. The Maliboomer is based on a traditional fairground test-your-strength machine and rockets passengers 200ft in the air, propelling them on a high-powered compressed air system. As at all the rides, there are warnings before you board that pregnant women or those suffering from heart conditions, bad backs and motion sickness should not participate. To the foregoing, add cowards. Yes, your correspondent funked this ride. There was no way I was going to play human yo-yos. There was no way I wanted see Mr Mondavi's merlot reappear. And, frankly, there was no way I wanted to have such an elevated view of Los Angeles. Yellow-streaked I am; terra firma is my natural habitat. So what on earth, you may well ask, was I doing contemplating getting on board California Screamin', the mother and father of all rollercoasters. Only the day before, I had been genuinely terrified by the Space Mountain ride in old Disneyland, a hellish descent in near total darkness. Now I was preparing to board the world's longest steel made looping rollercoaster. I think the need to conquer my fear had a little to do with it but, also, even an arrant coward gets bored with being called chicken after a while. Once the harness has encased you, the car pushes away and immediately comes to a halt. Not for long. In four seconds, you are screaming to 55mph and straight up a 45 degree slope. The rake of the bends, the plummets, the swoops, the thunder of rock music - it's all stunning, while the piece de resistance, a 360-degree loop round Mickey Mouse's face, is truly joyous. This is the king of rides. My fellow queasy rider, Jonathan Glancey of the Guardian, and I shared a heartfelt handshake of mutual congratulation as we stepped off. So, is the $1.4 billion investment worth it? As a theme park virgin, I was unsure of what to expect, except that I had distinct doubts about the intrusive presence of Disney characters, doubts confirmed when Minnie Mouse grabbed me. But this cavil aside, I can honestly say I haven't had so much innocent fun for many a long year. A beguiling recipe of high speed and technical wizardry makes for a wonderful way to spend three or four days. And now, if you'll excuse me, California Screamin' has just bucketed past my window at the Grand California Hotel. Nought-50 in four seconds... I think I'll have some more of that.
