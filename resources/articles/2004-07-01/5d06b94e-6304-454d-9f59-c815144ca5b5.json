Her appearance with the Prague Philharmonia under Jiri Belohlavek would have been remarkable under any circumstances, but last week the story of her involvement with Sir Simon Rattle (confirmed the day after her performance in a statement from them both) gave a special frisson to her interpretation of her compatriot Vitezslav Novak's Melancholic Songs of Love. The flowery and sickly text of the songs, sensuously set by Novak, speaks of the overwhelming power of love. Kozena sang them as if they had been written for her - her ravishing, translucent voice making twee lines such as 'a delicate forget-me-not peers down into the frothy waves' sound positively erotic. But there are danger signals in these songs, too, and Kozena was particularly effective in the second of the cycle where she was required to speak the last word of the last line: 'Love is like a star: it fades'. Sir Simon is warned. The evening formed part of the Prom's Back to Bohemia theme and so alongside the post-Romantic Songs of Love we had examples by Prague contemporaries of Mozart, including Myslivecek, whose fiery aria 'Che non mi disse un di!' gave Kozena a chance to show off her formidable, effortless technique. Stunning. Once the 110th season had cleared its throat with the First Night and the Nation's Favourite Prom, we plunged straight into the first Back to Bohemia Prom on Sunday_ but the audience took fright. No doubt the prospect of four hours of a rarely heard Dvorak opera kept them away, yet more fool those who were not there: Dimitrij - while not being a stunner - was certainly a revelation. We don't automatically associate Dvorak with opera, but he spent 10 years as a pit player in Prague, honing his craft playing the mainstays of the repertoire night after night. He knew from first-hand what worked in the theatre, so his writing for the stage has a refreshing directness and narrative drive. Today, his Rusalka has a firm place in the canon, yet his earlier work is hardly ever performed. However, Richard Hickox, recently conducted Dimitrij in Vienna and brought it and several members of that cast to the Proms to mark the centenary of Dvorak's death. It has never been professionally staged in Britain (indeed, it wasn't heard here until 1979) and we naturally had to be content with a concert performance, but there was no doubting the drama of the piece. The story is a sequel to Mussorgsky's Boris Gudunov. Dimitrij, a Polish-backed pretender, seizes the Russian throne, but is brought down by the very woman who put him in power when he falls for the dead Tsar's daughter. Plenty of meat there, and Dvorak gives us a work with an early Verdian sweep, the chorus playing a pivotal role, commenting on the action and constantly switching allegiance as tensions between Russians and Poles ebb and flow. Hickox had assembled a stellar line-up of principals including the great Elena Prokina as Marina, Dimitrij's scheming wife, and Krassimira Stoyanova as his lover, the beautiful Xenie. Both had extended duets with the sweet-voiced tenor Stuart Skelton, making an impressive Proms debut as Dimitrij. These dialogues are the pillars of the work and contain torrents of lovely melody, exploited to the full by the principals and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. But Dvorak can never shut out the sunlight in his music and here lies the problem. Beauty, serenity, elegance; he can do all those, but gravity? Well, no. Xenie opens act four singing of the death of her love. 'Oh, I am unhappy beyond measure' she laments, but you would never guess it from the melody she is given to sing. From Bohemia we travelled to China when the BBC Symphony Orchestra, under Leonard Slatkin, premiered Zhou Long's The Immortal, a dramatic evocation of the enduring spirit of the artist in twentieth-century China. Slatkin was joined by the ebullient Jean-Yves Thib-audet (resplendent in a Vivienne Westwood satin suit) for an electric account of Liszt's second piano concerto, but the crowning glory of the evening was a magnificent reading of Strauss's gigantic An Alpine Symphony, a outstanding example of the supreme artistry of this great orchestra and an eloquent testament to why the Proms is still our greatest music festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
