Mourinho \u2013 who insists the United captain, Wayne Rooney, is \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d \u2013 is still seeking consistent results, selection and form from his squad after three months of the Premier League campaign. The EFL Cup win against Manchester City on Wednesday lifted the mood around Old Trafford but, Mourinho admitted, he will need time to change the psychology of those players who are not accustomed to winning the game\u2019s top honours on a regular basis. It is time he believes is afforded other Premier League contenders and managers but not himself. \u201cIn three months it is not so easy to change the most difficult thing which are personalities,\u201d Mourinho, the United manager, said. \u201cThe style of play, even with mistakes, you can change here and there but at the psychological level it takes more time especially if you go against the nature of some of the personalities. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have a very experienced squad where everybody knows how to win, what is needed to win, that consistency level you must have to cope with the routine of victories, because that is difficult to cope with although it is easier than the routine of defeat, that\u2019s the most difficult time of the process. \u201cWe need time. It is always the same story. At some clubs and with some managers they have all the time they want. Some clubs get time but with others you demand immediate success of the clubs and the managers. That\u2019s Manchester United and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. No problem.\u201d Mourinho described United as the latest in a long line of clubs in need of an overhaul upon his arrival, and insisted more perspective is required over the squad at his disposal. \u201cI always went to clubs in a non-easy process,\u201d he said. \u201cI never went to a winning club with recent success where you can just introduce a bit of your salt and pepper and change the direction and the road to success was there. I always had difficult moments. Then I left Porto as European champions, I left Inter as European champions, I left Chelsea with two titles in three years and I left Real Madrid with three Champions League semi-finals and with a title and then I got this club in a hard situation but that\u2019s a great job. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way I prefer, it\u2019s just the way it is. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I arrived at the club without Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane or Bryan Robson. I arrived later with a very good group of players to work with but many of them are not the end product, they are not ready, ready, ready, and some of them like Michael [Carrick] are in a period where they are phenomenal but they are not in the group that is 24 or 25. \u201cIt is a process but I don\u2019t change a word from the first day \u2013 we want to win. At this club you must say that always and at this moment we still have four competitions to win. Let\u2019s see out of the four what we win \u2013 four, three, two, one or nothing.\u201d Mourinho declined to comment on being charged with improper conduct by the Football Association for discussing the referee Anthony Taylor\u2019s appointment to the recent Liverpool game. But he did dismiss claims that Rooney is destined for the Old Trafford exit having lost his first-team place this season. The United manager, who confirmed that Rooney is fit for the Premier League game against Burnley on Saturday, said: \u201cI know he\u2019s the type of player I need and I know he can play at the top level. I can\u2019t make this kind of mental exercise and say what\u2019s going to happen at 32, 33, 34 or 35 [Rooney turned 31 this week]. What I can say is that he\u2019s a very good player, a very important player for us. He\u2019s going nowhere. We like him, he likes us. He\u2019s not happy in the last matches because he was on the bench but I think he is even unhappier when he\u2019s not on the bench because he\u2019s been injured and has to stay in the stands. There are no problems at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
