If those viewers genuinely interested in buying a car could then find extensive information on models they like, downloaded the previous night to their TV equipment, this could become the holy grail of advertising. The prospect of supplementing current scattergun methods of advertising with better targeted information may sound far fetched, but the BBC is among those that believe that as many as a third of British homes will have the facilities to do this within three to five years. Personal video recorders (PVRs), which can build detailed profiles of individual viewing and purchasing preferences, are being incorporated into a range of consumer electronics equipment, from set top boxes to games consoles and DVD players. Philips says most of its DVD players will come fitted with hard disk storage within the next two years. Keith Rattray, interactive TV director for Carat, says that when PVR technology is combined with two-way digital TV networks such as Sky Digital or cable that let consumers respond to programmes on TV and let advertisers download material to people's TV equipment, then interactive advertising starts to become very powerful. PVR technology, once reviled for threatening to undermine the traditional 30-second spot ad on TV because it lets viewers skip commercials, is putting the controls back into advertisers' hands. While there are data protection issues to determine, this is nothing short of dynamite for an industry that famously wastes half its budget. ITV, for one, believes the time is ripe to explore the future. With advertising revenues in freefall and audiences fragmenting, it is keen to prove that it can add value for advertisers. The company is still negotiating terms with BSkyB, but in the New Year it plans to start running interactive advertisements on Sky Digital. This marks a significant milestone in the advertising industry, according to Howard Nead, in charge of interactive services at the media planning and buying agency, PHD. \"It means your interactive campaign will reach 20% of the population instead of 5% now,\" he says. \"We want to push this medium and see what it can do,\" says Jane Marshall, chief executive of Carlton Active, which is driving the project along with Granada, ITV's other key owner. She agrees that PVRs will create a change in the potential for interactive advertising but expects this will happen outside the UK first. Here, rapid digital TV penetration means that there are between 7m and 8m set top boxes in use that don't have these facilities. \"Channels like ITV want to appeal to a broad cross-section of the audience, not a sub-section,\" she says. \"There is a lot you can do without PVRs. In the next few years, we think the interactive medium will be used to drive viewer responses and it will be used by advertisers who traditionally spend their money on creating very effective ads that are really about branding.\" ITV's decision is prompting some agencies to take the medium more seriously. Publicis Networks is among those which plan to start applying the same production values and creative input to the interactive element of a TV ad as it does to the 30-second spot. Until now, interactive programming has tended to get a tiny percentage of overall budget and look like teletext rather than TV. Initial results are encouraging. Earlier this year a total of 64% of viewers with access to a US commercial from Ford for its Explorer sports utility vehicle clicked their remote controls to request a brochure. The company also discovered that viewers of predominantly family-oriented networks requested the brochure twice as often as those that catered mainly for male business travellers. And it identified the time of day when the ad attracted most attention. Similarly, L'Or\u00e9al Garnier ran a cross-media campaign to reach its crucial youth audience in 10m households in Toronto earlier this year and 40% of all entries for a prize draw set up to promote the brand came via its interactive TV ad. In the UK, Rimmel and Debenhams have had similar success with viewer-response campaigns and a range of others, including Procter and Gamble, Unilever and Nissan are exploring the new medium. Getting people to order brochures is unlikely to create a seismic shift in the industry, but once PVRs are more widespread, the interactive medium could become the creative edge for advertising, particularly since interactive programming is not governed by ITV rules, according to Jon Williams, creative director of Publicis Networks. He believes that the kind of interactive programming that PVRs will facilitate are where viewers can choose different storylines, as pioneered by the Depaul Trust with its gritty campaign to build awareness about homelessness on Kingston Communications' broadband phone network in Hull. All routes led to the same result for the homeless character portrayed, but \"what you get from participating in that way is a deeper immersive brand experience,\" says Williams. Kingston's network is a rarity, but PVRs can act as an alternative because they can store alternative storylines in people's hard drives. Some advertisers, including BMW, are already experimenting with it. The company says that since it is becoming increasingly difficult for network TV to find a significant audience, it will use any means it can to get closer to its prospects. It produced a series of short films, each directed by big-name directors, including Guy Ritchie, John Woo and Tony Scott. Initially these were distributed from the BMW Films.com site, but they were also downloaded to US consumers' TiVo boxes. TiVo's sales have been disappointing so far because the product is sold as a subscription service and the product is difficult to understand. But the platform has been useful in monitoring how PVRs are changing viewers' habits. Pepsi's ad featuring Britney Spears' pastiche of bygone Pepsi campaigns from the 1950s onwards proved to be the most replayed footage in US TiVo homes during the Super Bowl earlier this year - traditionally the US launch pad for new campaigns - not the game itself. In the UK, there are still problems hindering the development of interactive advertising. Advertisers say BSkyB is charging too much to make transactional advertising worthwhile. PVR technology is still expensive but will gain momentum as prices fall and it gets easier to use and as it comes built into different electronics equipment. Advertisers are increasing their investment in interactive advertising as it offers a way of measuring the effectiveness of their campaigns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
