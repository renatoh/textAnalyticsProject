The regulations, which came into force on September 1 after a tussle with the Association of Football Agents and which will apply in the next transfer window, do, for the first time, include a prohibition of bungs. \"Agents must not make payments to any club, club official, manager or player as a result of a [transfer] transaction or contract negotiation,\" Rule G3 states, with a straight face - but actual corruption was surely against the rules before and nobody believes it can be stamped out by those naked words. The regulations are intended rather to straighten out the slovenly grey areas which have always characterised football's dealings. The Stevens inquiry - about whose effectiveness many in football remain sceptical - was better on the weaknesses in the game's regulations and practices than on the alleged bungs it was set up to investigate and failed to find. The first report by Quest, the company Lord Stevens chairs, last December, \"cleared\" 95% of Premier League transfers of any wrongdoing, but did contain blasts of criticism. Clubs paid agents directly, conflicts of interest were rife with agents acting for both club and player in the same transfer, and the players themselves were \"largely unaware\" of the amounts of money their own agents were being paid by the clubs. Several clubs' documentation was \"vaguely worded\" or actually false. Quest's view of the FA's performance was not pretty - it had, as a regulator, \"failed\". Those findings from the Premier League's own inquiry mirrored the judgment of a VAT tribunal four months earlier, which ruled that Newcastle United had made false statements on the forms which have to be filed with the FA to register transfers or new contracts. The club's chief operating officer, Russell Cushing, admitted that Newcastle filled the forms in incorrectly in order to get round the rule that an agent can act for only one party. \"It is generally acknowledged that [football's] rules cannot accurately reflect the global business we are now operating in,\" Cushing told the tribunal. Newcastle lost that case, were partly successful on appeal, and the case is due to be heard once more back in the tribunal. Then in May this year, another VAT tribunal handed a resounding defeat to Birmingham City, ruling that the club had not been \"truthful\" with the FA and that the club's paperwork could not be taken \"at face value\". The agents with whom Birmingham had dealt \"did not adhere scrupulously to the rules\" either, while the FA was \"less than rigorous\", never investigating or even checking the information it was given. Birmingham, like Newcastle, had been seeking to reclaim the VAT on fees they paid to agents, arguing that when players were signed or renewed their contracts, the agents acted solely for the club and not the players. Birmingham's managing director, Karren Brady, described by the tribunal as \"a formidable woman who knows her own mind, and is determined to succeed in achieving her objectives\", conducted the negotiations for the club, and she explained what happened in very similar terms to those set out by Cushing. Once Birmingham's manager, Steve Bruce, had identified a player he wanted the club to sign, Brady contacted the player's agent. The players had written agreements in which the agents agreed to act only for the player in any deal, but Brady's view was that the club instructed the agents. She told them what the club was prepared to pay the players, and agreed to pay the agents a fee if they could persuade the players to accept those terms and \"deliver\" the players to the club. \"She expected the agent to abandon his relationship with and loyalty to the player, for the duration of the negotiation,\" the tribunal said. When a player signed, Birmingham paid the agent directly and the required forms went to the FA, mostly declaring that the agent had acted for the club and not the player - who, apparently, had nobody representing him. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs challenged that, saying Birmingham should not be entitled to reclaim the VAT on the fees paid to agents, because in reality, the agents represented the players. HMRC claimed that: \"The documentation sent to the FA was no more than window-dressing, designed to enable the clubs to recover the VAT they had paid.\" On all the deals Brady negotiated directly with agents, the tribunal ruled in HMRC's favour, and made grim, familiar observations. It found that in football generally, the rules governing agents' conduct were observed \"somewhat casually\", \"frequently disregarded\" and that \"Birmingham City FC was by no means the only club whose respect for the rules was less than strict\". In some deals - players' and agents' names were not revealed - Birmingham had told the FA, \"falsely, as Ms Brady accepted\", that they had a written contract with the agent when \"that was plainly not the case. There is no reason to believe that other assertions made to the FA were any more truthful. We have concluded that no reliance can be placed on those declarations.\" As for the governing body: \"It was apparent . . . that regulation by the FA has been less than rigorous.\" The tribunal found that the FA never challenged any paperwork which came to it as long as all the boxes were ticked. \"It is not surprising that many (though not all) clubs and agents were somewhat casual in their approach to the rules, when the chances of being penalised for non-compliance were negligible, if not non-existent.\" Birmingham are appealing that judgment to the high court, arguing, as Newcastle are, that the agents did work on behalf of the club to deliver the players. A queue of other clubs, challenged by HMRC following a wide-ranging investigation into football, is waiting on the appeal. The FA, though, is holding its hand up. \"We do recognise that our monitoring and regulation of the transfer system was not as firm as it should have been,\" an FA source said. \"But we have greatly improved it. There are six new staff in our regulatory section, and, crucially, we now have the new agents' regulations.\" As the agents will be told tomorrow, if they represent a player on a deal they cannot now act for the club too, and the player himself must pay them. The agents have fought this hard, because clubs have always paid them, with most players oblivious to the arrangement. Now, agents fear players will not want to pay their fees, which will cost 40% more because they are coming out of the players' taxed income, and 17.5% more with VAT. \"There is a danger,\" one agent warned this week, \"that it will be driven underground again, with clubs secretly paying agents.\" The FA, better-resourced and, we are assured, more purposeful now, has promised to stand firm, regulate transfers properly for the first time in football's history - and so confound its many critics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
