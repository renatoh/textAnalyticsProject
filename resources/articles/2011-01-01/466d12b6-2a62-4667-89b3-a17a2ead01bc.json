Today Nick Clegg made all the confident noises expected of a party leader making his second campaign visit to the west Pennine constituency. But he also sounded like a man sensibly hedging his bets against the possibility of disappointment. Close by his side during a walkabout at the Asda in Shaw, Elwyn Watkins \u2013 the Lib Dem candidate who took the Labour MP, Phil Woolas, to the election court \u2013 is assertive in his leader's presence, proud to have beaten Labour's \"lies\" in court, the first such case in 99 years. \"A lot of people respect what I did, that counts around here,\" he said. But Watkins neatly expresses his own dilemma. \"This is not a referendum [on the coalition], it is about electing a local MP,\" he tells voters, some of whom have rallied indignantly to his cause after judges expelled Woolas. Others are more concerned to pass judgment on the Cameron-Clegg coalition, which is how Labour wants it \u2013 tuition fees, VAT hikes, police cuts, job losses. All three main parties can claim to be in with a good chance if tactical voting breaks their way. The Tory, Kashif Ali, is an Oldham-born Kashmiri made good, a well-regarded barrister who won only 2,413 fewer votes than Woolas in May. But a tactical squeeze on the Tory vote is under way and the bookies now think Labour's Debbie Abrahams, a former NHS executive, will edge it on national issues. Today, Clegg spoke of the need for \"a good clean contest\" after the Woolas affair as he canvassed voters in their homes and addressed a Q&amp;A session. But he combined it with a scornfully anti-Labour message via the regional media.He did so in interviews next to Asda's DVD stand, which offered The Invention of Lying and Public Enemies, still only a fiver despite the VAT rise. The media were interested chiefly in today's YouGov poll \u2013 Lib Dems down to 8% \u2013 and in claims that Cameron is pulling his punches to help Clegg and deny Ed Miliband a triumph. Polls \"gyrate wildly\" and the Tory campaign is their own affair, he replies. Sheltering from the rain outside Asda with their \"Win with Elwyn\" stickers, Lib Dem activists from all over the north believe local Tories want to win. They have been targeting paid election literature at individual voters instead of relying on the single free post allowed by law, says one. And 20 Tory MPs have been spotted canvassing, says another. Oldham has a substantial Bangldeshi, Pakistani and Kashmiri population (27%) , concentrated in the redbrick terraces. Clegg met some privately yesterday, but chose to let TV crews follow him through more affluent suburbs and villages with names like Diggle and Delph. Taking questions from a respectful audience of mainly older votes in Saddleworth museum he defended further education students from \"snobbery\" and attacked the behaviour of bankers \"gorging themselves on bonuses\" while others suffered. \"It's not socially acceptable,\" he said to general approval."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
