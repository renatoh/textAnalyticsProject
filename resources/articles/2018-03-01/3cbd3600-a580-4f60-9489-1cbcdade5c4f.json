In fact, the plans to modernise the line from Cardiff to Swansea, the Midland mainline and tracks in the Lake District were dropped after Network Rail spent huge sums on engineering works, said a report by the National Audit Office. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, slipped the announcement of the cancellations out last summer in a written statement as parliament prepared for the summer recess. \u201cNew bi-mode train technology offers seamless transfer from diesel power to electric that is undetectable to passengers,\u201d Grayling said at the time. \u201cThis means that we no longer need to electrify every line to achieve the same significant improvements to journeys, and we will only electrify lines where it delivers a genuine benefit to passengers.\u201d \u201cModern bi-mode trains\u201d meant there was no need to put up with \u201cdisruptive electrification works\u201d and \u201cintrusive wires and masts\u201d, he added. The NAO investigation found that the reasons for the cancellations had been purely financial after costs had escalated and Network Rail\u2019s capacity to borrow had been limited because it was redefined as a public body. The plans were abandoned even though electrification of the Midland mainline to Sheffield had been a 2015 Conservative party manifesto commitment. The 2015 manifesto also stated that work was under way to electrify the railway in south Wales. In 2012, when he announced the \u00a338bn programme, David Cameron declared that it was the biggest investment since the Victorian era. Network Rail\u2019s electrification works around the country, most notably on the Great Western mainline from London to Swansea, which started in 2014, were originally described as a vital upgrade that would bring cleaner, faster and more reliable services for passengers. But by 2015 it was already clear the upgrading would cost much more than anticipated. The NAO report established that Network Rail ranked all the projects according to how far advanced they were, how much had already been spent and what the \u201creputational harm\u201d of cancellation would be. There was fury in the Midlands and South Yorkshire when it was announced that electrification of the line from Kettering to Sheffield had been abandoned on the grounds that HS2 would offer a quicker service and that the introduction of bi-mode trains had made electrification unnecessary. Bi-mode trains are still in development, and the NAO concludes they will have higher running costs and be less green than an electrified system. The leader of the Aslef rail union, Mick Whelan, said that the NAO report showed Grayling had \u201clied\u201d. \u201cThe truth is that the government didn\u2019t want to find the money and made up a story about \u2018sudden improvements\u2019 using \u2018state-of-the-art bi-mode trains\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy, an exercise in smoke and mirrors, to disguise the truth, and Mr Grayling has been rumbled.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
