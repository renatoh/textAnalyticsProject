The creation of a single regulatory body similar to the US Securities and Exchange Commission is controversial as national regulators are not keen to give up power to a cross-border body. Mr Diekmann said Allianz now reported to 48 different national supervisory authorities across three financial sectors and was active in 29 European countries in insurance, banking and asset management."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
