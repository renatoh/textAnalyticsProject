If so, perhaps it's time you took a master class in cookery with one of London's leading head chefs. Tasting Places (020 7460 0077) offers courses in some of the capital's top restaurants, including Sir Terence Conran's Blue Print Cafe, Moro and Le Caprice, and next year is to introduce the only course in the kitchen of a two-Michelin-starred restaurant with Stephen Blumer, of Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons, Oxfordshire. The company has opened a kitchen in London's Holland Park where it will offer courses with head chefs including Alan Bird of celeb-haunt The Ivy and Mark Edwards, chef director of Nobu, who'll reveal the secret of the famous black cod in miso. Courses include lunch, refreshments and wine from \u00a3150 per day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
