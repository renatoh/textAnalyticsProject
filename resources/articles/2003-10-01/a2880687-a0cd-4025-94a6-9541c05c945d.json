What this year's festival offers instead is a chance to catch up with revivals of early works and find out what the rebel choreographers did next. Some just carried on, like ageing rock stars; others became so reputable they've ended up in opera. Take Trisha Brown, now on her fifth Umbrella visit. She started in downtown New York doing confoundingly simple pieces based on tasks, mostly in silence or with spoken commentary. From 1983, she brought work to London that gave us a different perspective on how dance could be viewed. Set and Reset, which opened her latest programme at Sadler's Wells, dates from that period, marking the introduction of music - a big step for her. Laurie Anderson's hypnotic score, based on the repeated phrase 'Long time no see', releases cascades of movement. Now you see the dancers in their transparent pyjamas, now you don't. They slip in and out of the wings, walk against invisible walls, tumble backwards out of sight. Robert Rauschenberg's choice of grainy newsreel footage flickers overhead. This crop of dancers, however, don't fall and fly as recklessly as their forebears, whose moves seemed spontaneous. Set and Reset has become more deliberate 20 years on, in tune with Brown's altered aesthetic. She's gone for greater control, as last year's Geometry of Quiet demonstrates. Instead of using their weight to generate off-balance momentum, the dancers sustain their poses. They form sculptural groupings, draped in billowing sails of white silk. Now, she's being beauteous, inspired by Salvatore Sciarrino's breathy flute music. This is Brown in high priestess mode, as in her minimalist moves for Simon Keenlyside's staging of Winterreise at the Barbican last month. She has grown so solemn that her early irreverence seems a buried memory. Even her jazz trilogy, an attempt to lighten up to the music of Dave Douglas, is mired in earnestness. Groove and Countermove (2000), which completes the trilogy, reprises her signature device of a line of dancers repeating each others' moves in fractured canons. Dressed in rainbow-coloured outfits, they resemble the chunky keys of a children's xylophone. Though they spell out the syncopated phrases of the score, the result is unenlightening. Like a jazz pianist, Brown is vamping, waiting for inspiration to return. Josef Nadj comes from the other end of the spectrum. He is quintessentially European, a creator and performer of tightly constructed works that can fit into theatre, mime or dance festivals. Based in France, he combines the eccentricity of Jacques Tati with the surrealism of Magritte and the ideas of a slew of Middle European artists and writers. His onstage uniform is bowler hat, boots and rusty black overcoat. In Le temps du repli , his companion, C\u00e9cile Thieblemont, wears a long, slinky dress of tatty fur and battered hat. Locked together in a lifelong ritual of rows and accommodations, they are accompanied by Vladimir Tarasov on bits and pieces of percussion. It's a pas de deux with more lifts in an hour than any ballet choreographer would dare risk. They start by touching elbows, knees, the soles of their boots, the backs of their necks. They fold each other into origami shapes, or treat each other like furniture to be sat on, reassembled. She has a protesting, sensual solo; he watches impassively before slapping his face with his huge hands and launching into a body popping routine. Each sequence ends abruptly, as though they've worked something out of their system. Every now and again, they co-operate in a game of chess (of a sort). There's a sense of desperation in the timing, driven by Tarasov's tapping; then they ease off into a tango, twist on a table top and collapse into an exhausted embrace on the floor. Their journey is a compelling one, going nowhere. But en route, moments of mad humour and beauty have provided the fix a festival junkie seeks from Dance Umbrella."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
