Shares in the Woodford Patient Capital Trust Fund have tumbled 25% to 58p since 3 June, when Woodford made the shock decision to suspend his flagship Equity Income Fund, following a surge in redemptions sparked by bad market bets. While the FTSE 250-listed fund is not directly affected by the suspension, the move at its sister fund caused a sell off in shares and the value of shareholder investments to decline. At least three local authority pension funds, including Derbyshire, West Yorkshire and Dyfed in Wales, have investments tied up in Woodford\u2019s patient capital fund and risk seeing their investments fall further as the stock price continues to slide. Those pensions investments help fund retirement benefits for members including local government employees, councillors, school teachers, charities and housing association staff. Concerns over public investments in Woodford\u2019s fund first came into focus when Kent County Council was blocked from pulling \u00a3263m from his equity income fund at the end of May. It is believed that the local authority\u2019s request prompted Woodford to suspend the fund. Joel Benjamin, a member of Research for Action, which investigates public finances, said the episode raised questions over whether councils should be trusted to make large, risky investments. \u201cLocal authorities have a dubious record investing money on our behalf, with \u00a31bn losses in Iceland\u2019s banks in 2008 still fresh in people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said. The \u00a314.3bn West Yorkshire Pension Fund confirmed it holds a \u00a33.5m stake in the listed vehicle, but stressed its investments are reviewed on a regular basis. It refused to comment further on its patient capital trust holdings and confirmed it never held shares in Woodford\u2019s suspended equity income fund. Meanwhile, the rapid fall in Woodford\u2019s share price has left Derbyshire\u2019s pension fund \u00a3800,000 worse off. Derbyshire\u2019s pension scheme, which is worth \u00a35bn and has 100,000 members, holds 5m shares in Woodford\u2019s funds as part of its private equity portfolio. That investment is now worth \u00a33m compared with \u00a33.8m at the start of June. Jason Hollands, a managing director at Tilney Investment Management, said: \u201cThe trust is clearly experiencing significant selling pressure, on the back of the reputational hit to the manager, and because it has cross holdings in a number of businesses in common with the suspended fund which the latter needs to sell.\u201d The last snapshot of the trust\u2019s top 10 holdings included digital lender Atom Bank, a cold fusion nuclear energy firm called Industrial Heat, and artificial intelligence business Benevolent AI. While Hollands said the council pension fund holdings in Woodford are relatively small given the typical size of local authority retirement schemes, they are at risk of a loss on investment if shares end up being sold before the price recovers. The Dyfed Pension Fund, which manages the pension benefits for Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion county councils, holds a \u00a32.4m stake in Woodford\u2019s listed fund. It accounts for 0.1% of its total \u00a32.4bn pension scheme. \u201cWe have nothing invested in the Equity Income fund,\u201d a Carmarthenshire spokeswoman said on behalf of the Dyfed Pension Fund. \u201cWe cannot comment further on future plans at this time.\u201d Woodford Patient Capital Trust declined to comment on the pension scheme holdings and share price decline. The trust\u2019s board tried to calm investor nerves last week by saying its operations had not been affected by the equity income fund suspension. Susan Searle, the trust\u2019s chair, said: \u201cThe board is pleased with the operational progress of its portfolio companies, which the board believes continue to have the potential to deliver attractive returns, in line with the long-term mandate of the company. \u201cThe operational performance of these businesses is not impacted by recent events.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
