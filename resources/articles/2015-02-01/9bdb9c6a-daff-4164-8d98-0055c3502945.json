When Tottenham Hotspur last won a trophy, it was the Carling Cup in 2008 and Chelsea were the team they beat in the final. Kane remembers it vividly. He was in the Wembley crowd as a 14-year-old fan. Seven years on Kane enters the re-run on Sunday afternoon as Tottenham\u2019s leading man, their 24-goal striker and one of the feelgood stories of the season. His journey from starry-eyed Tottenham supporter to centre stage in the Capital One Cup final has been marked by a refusal to be cowed by setbacks and, more recently, a clutch of Roy of the Rovers moments. He can feel the call of destiny. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Wembley a couple of times for England [youth matches] but the one which stands out for me is the Carling Cup final against Chelsea, which we won,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI was there as a fan, with the family, and it was a great day out. To see them lift the trophy and all the fans to stay behind and to stay with them is something that I\u2019ve been thinking of leading up to this final. If I\u2019m up there lifting the trophy, it would be something very special. So, yeah, I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d There is little that supporters love more than to see one of their own wearing their club\u2019s shirt and living their dream. Kane finesses the connection because he is such a humble, likeable young man and because his rise to prominence has been so sudden and, yes, unlikely. As recently as early November, Kane was not a part of the manager Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s starting team for the most important matches, despite knocking loudly on his door with goals in the Europa League and Capital One Cup. His biggest one was against Besiktas. But the turning point came at Aston Villa in the Premier League, when he came on for Emmanuel Adebayor as Tottenham trailed 1-0 and scored the last-gasp winner with a deflected free-kick. There was an element of good fortune but the overriding impression was of a young player who was forcing things to happen for himself and the team. Pochettino could omit him no more, gave him his first league start of the season, ahead of Adebayor, against Stoke City on 9 November and what has happened since has taken the breath away. As Adebayor has gone into reverse \u2013 the Togolese has become White Hart Lane\u2019s forgotten man \u2013 Kane has been an ever present in the league. He has 14 goals in total, the most memorable being the doubles that sank Chelsea and Arsenal. Everything is happening at breakneck speed. Roy Hodgson has said that he will give Kane his first senior call-up for the upcoming fixtures against Lithuania and Italy; the first of them, on 27 March, will see him back at Wembley. Kane has become only the second Spur since 2007-08 to pass 20 goals in a season (Gareth Bale was the other one) while he stands to be the first since Gary Lineker in 1991-92 to reach 30. There have been heady comparisons to Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham, and he has even managed to wangle two new contracts out of Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, in six months. Off-the-field, there has been increased attention, on himself and his girlfriend, Kate Goodland. \u201cI\u2019ve told her she\u2019ll have to keep her feet on the ground, we all do,\u201d Kane says, with one of his broad smiles. There was also the publicity about his dark secret \u2013 he spent a year at the Arsenal academy when he was eight \u2013 while pictures emerged after his match-winning performance in the north London derby on 7 February of him as a 10-year-old with dyed red hair, at Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles title parade. \u201cAt that age, most kids are just football fans,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI love Tottenham and I think the last derby definitely showed that. People will always have an opinion and there will be pictures but that\u2019s this day and age, and Twitter, and what you\u2019ve got to deal with. \u201cIn a way, it was a compliment that those pictures came out. If I hadn\u2019t have scored, they would never have come out. I don\u2019t know what Arsenal fans think of me. That was a very special day for me and one I won\u2019t forget.\u201d Part of the fascination with Kane relates to his explosive improvement. It is one thing for a 21-year-old Englishman to establish himself in a top-level team but quite another to become its talisman. And all in the space of under four months. Kane has always been strong but now he looks stronger and he is bullying centre-halves, notably Gary Cahill in the 5-3 home win over Chelsea on New Year\u2019s Day. He also looks quicker, sharper, lighter on his feet. Throw in his natural goal instinct and sky-high levels of confidence and it is a potent cocktail. \u201cI\u2019m a late birth, on 28 July, and I was a late developer in my age group,\u201d Kane says. \u201cEven this year, I have developed in terms of muscles. I\u2019ve done a lot of work in the gym with the new manager and the new staff to help me get stronger and fitter and gain that extra yard of pace. I can see it in my game. It\u2019s definitely helping me this season. I\u2019ll keep working to get that little bit quicker and stronger because that\u2019s what you have to do to become a top, top player.\u201d Kane talks about Pochettino\u2019s much-lauded fitness regime, which took in what he describes as \u201cby far the toughest pre-season I\u2019ve had under any manager\u201d. It was defined by a lot of running and gruelling double sessions, and it has set up Kane to cover 13km in matches, not to mention help him and the team to finish strongly in them. Tottenham\u2019s season has been fired by important late goals. In the end, though, any young player needs a manager to trust them and here Kane gets animated. \u201cI think it\u2019s harder for a player to come through the ranks these days,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money in football and if a team hasn\u2019t got an answer, they just go and buy someone. But that\u2019s not always the answer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got young players \u2013 the likes of me, Ryan [Mason], Andros [Townsend] and Nabil [Bentaleb] \u2013 who have shown that you don\u2019t always have to buy. There are players in your academy that are good enough. It\u2019s just whether or not they get the chance. Maybe, other clubs will look at us and start looking at the academies. But it\u2019s such a cut-throat league and the pressure on managers is tough. You have to have a strong manager to do that.\u201d Kane has come up the hard way, via successful loans at Leyton Orient and Millwall, and less successful ones at Norwich City and Leicester City. He joined Tottenham aged 11 but, by then, he had already been rejected by them \u2013 and Arsenal. \u201cI remember my Dad telling me I was released from Arsenal, I wasn\u2019t too downhearted about it,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI was too young to think about it being a big deal. Once or twice a week after school, I\u2019d go there and play football.\u201d Arsenal had spotted Kane at Ridgeway Rovers \u2013 the junior club in Chingford that produced David Beckham \u2013 and he returned there before Tottenham took him into their academy, only to let him go. Kane went to Watford, where he played in a trial game against Tottenham and scored twice. Tottenham promptly took him back. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a footballer and I\u2019ve always believed that\u2019s the path I was going to go down,\u201d Kane says. \u201cIt\u2019s how you deal with the setbacks. Self-belief is a massive thing in football. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, not many others will.\u201d Kane also followed Beckham through Chingford Foundation School and he cites the former England captain as one of his inspirations. \u201cHe launched his Beckham Academy at the O\u00b2 [in 2005] and I got to meet him there,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI was a little skinhead. It was a great moment for me, as it was for the other kids. I also got to meet him when he came to train at Spurs [in January 2011]. He was a true professional.\u201d Kane played in the under-21 Premier League final in May 2013 against Manchester United, when a Tottenham team managed by Tim Sherwood lost 3-2 at Old Trafford, having been 2-0 up at half-time. The Chelsea showdown is of an altogether different scale. \u201cWe\u2019ve played well in the big games \u2013 Chelsea, Arsenal, this year \u2013 so we are really confident playing against the bigger teams now,\u201d Kane says. \u201cIt gives us a lot of confidence knowing that we beat Chelsea 5-3. It\u2019s all about us and what we can do.\u201d Harry Kane was speaking at a Tottenham Hotspur Foundation event highlighting the Education and Football Development Centre programme, which provides Academy-standard coaching alongside BTEC and FA level qualifications to create life-changing opportunities to young people aged 16-18 not in education, employment or training.
