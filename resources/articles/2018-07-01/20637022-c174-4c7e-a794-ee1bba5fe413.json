The International Champions Cup still has many, many games remaining for those who simply can\u2019t wait a couple of weeks for these games to mean something. The biggest is tomorrow night, when Lyon takes on the short-handed North Carolina Courage. If we get a photo of Shaqiri\u2019s goal, we\u2019ll add it. Other than that, see you next time. Not the sort of game to draw any sort of conclusions. Both teams had several absentees, of course, and United had more than Liverpool. But United got absolutely nothing from this one aside from Andreas Pereira\u2019s free-kick beauty. Liverpool ran wave after wave of attackers at the United defense, and even if one of the two penalties was a bit dodgy, there can be no complaints about the Sturridge goal and Shaqiri\u2019s ... well, can you have a goal of the year candidate in preseason? 90 min: We\u2019ll have 1 minute of stoppage time. Did we mention Shaqiri scored on an astounding bicycle kick? 88 min: Sturridge took exception to something. There\u2019s an argument at midfield. 87 min: Let\u2019s see ... Mane, Salah, Firmino and Shaqiri? Can they all start? United finally touches the ball, thanks to the keeper rolling it out to a defender. 85 min: A timely piece of defending to prevent a fifth Liverpool goal. Did we mention that Shaqiri scored on a magnificent bicycle kick? Tempted not to say anything else. Surely nothing that happens from this point will top that. A flurry of chances, and Shaqiri scores on the most difficult of them on a BICYCLE kick. 80 min: We\u2019re going to see Joshua Bohui for Manchester United, even though we wasn\u2019t listed in the lineups we saw earlier. Also, 17-year-old Angel Gomes is in. 79 min: Back the other way, and Curtis Jones is in a foot race with United\u2019s Chong. Chong wins. Shot count so far: Liverpool 13, United 3. Two of United shots were on goal -- a free kick drilled marvelously in the net, and a hurried shot that was rather tame. 76 min: CHANCE, and for a change, it\u2019s Manchester United, giving Alexi a run against Nathaniel Phillips. But the Liverpool academy defender holds his ground well and deflects it for a corner kick. The only Liverpool subs remaining are Markovic and Origi, though they\u2019d have to remove someone who\u2019s only been on for a short time. Manchester United still have Shaw, Williams, Gomes, Hamilton, Garner and Greenwood available. The attacker takes an eternity to walk toward the ball, then drills it in the left-side netting past the bewildered Pereira. 72 min: To recap recent action -- Liverpool continue to attack, and Manchester United do not. And ... PENALTY! Robertson falls in the United box, and ... do we have VAR? That looks fishy. Herrera is the alleged culprit. Liverpool lineup now, in no particular order: Kelleher, Chirivella, Gomez, Robertson, Grujic, Shaqiri, Phillips, Sturridge, Woodburn, Jones, Ojo. Meanwhile, Mata\u2019s off, and Chong is on. We were told he was on earlier. And it\u2019s a debut for Fred. 69 min: CHANCE for Liverpool, and again it\u2019s Sturridge, who curls one with his left foot that nearly goes in at the far post. Pereira would\u2019ve stood little chance. Also in the inbox: \u201cSenior Technical Writer/Editor sought ...\u201d ... oh, sorry, that apparently isn\u2019t related to the proceedings here. Will that goal force Manchester United to throw numbers forward? Will 16-year-old Mason Greenwood come in and score the equalizer? Excellent hold-up play from Shaqiri, and he puts it back to Sturridge. Yes, Sturridge. His first touch of the game is an 18-yarder that clips the inside of the post and goes in. \u201cAs a Michigander, a soccer fan (to use the US parlance), and a University of Michigan alumnus, it\u2019s great to see the big house hosting some real football,\u201d writes Timothy Borst. \u201cIs it just me, though, or are these American-football fields more narrow than your average English/European pitch? It seems to me that even the old White Hart Lane was wider.\u201d I usually look for the 10-yard mark on the end line, and I don\u2019t see one. It appears one was painted over? Not a good sign. Meanwhile, Liverpool make 5-6 substitutions. Sturridge and Jones are in. 63 min: Immediately back the other way, and Ojo puts the ball across the goal. Camacho heads it back to the middle, but no one\u2019s there. 62 min: Liverpool concede a free kick, which is a bad idea because it\u2019s the only way Manchester United seem likely to score. This one finds the boot of Alexis Sanchez, but Kelleher isn\u2019t wrong-footed by the deflection. Let\u2019s look for a photo and see what happens ... Well, we got a pitch invader ... 58 min: Another optimistic ball from Liverpool, but this one yields an awkward collision between Joel Pereira and a defender. We\u2019re told the crowd is 105,000, more than 4,000 fewer than the Manchester United-Real Madrid got four years ago. The sport is surely declining in this country. 55 min: An ambitious ball down the right for Liverpool, but Joel Pereira is quite alert, having been called into service a few times in 10 minutes. United\u2019s Scott McTominay gets a shot on a rare bit of possession the other way, but the tween-looking Kelleher collects it with ease. Not much possession for United, but does it matter? If not, I must be guessing the events of this match quite well. Tomorrow\u2019s Lotto numbers are 20, 29, 64 ... oh, I\u2019m sorry, those were Liverpool starters. 52 min: Solanke does well to keep an attack alive, and Camacho shoots from an acute angle, which will serve to warm up Joel Pereira in the United goal. Phillips, Ojo and Woodburn also in for Liverpool. Salah and Mane are out, among others. 48 min: Manchester United\u2019s Twitter feed confirms Pereira for Grant, and that\u2019s the only United sub. YELLOW CARD to Fabinho for a slight but unnecessary tap on Alexis\u2019 ankles. 47 min: Unconfirmed -- Joel Pereira in goal for United, replacing Lee Grant, who did quite well. Liverpool back in possession. Halftime subs: Let\u2019s try to find them all .. Caoimhin Kelleher replaces Grabara in goal, basically a swap of Liverpool academy keepers. Tahith Chong, an 18-year-old Dutchman, takes the field for Manchester United. And ... Shaqiri! Malcolm Fearon, responding to my comment that something always happens when I\u2019m looking for photos: \u201cI suggest you spend all the second half looking for photos!\u201d It\u2019s really not a bad match. Manchester United have even completed at least three passes in the opposing half. \u201cGreat commentary,\u201d writes Dylan Murray. \u201cMore entertaining than the actual match.\u201d Much appreciated, but you could put me alone on a field for a week, and I\u2019d never duplicate that free kick. From the Twitter file ... Indeed it was Villa. He\u2019s still young, though. Reminder of available United subs: Shaw, Garner, Pereira (GK), Chong, Gomes, Hamilton, Williams, Greenwood. Liverpool have many more possibilities, from Sturridge to Jones to Woodburn. Back in a few minutes. Email or Tweet away. 45 min: Camacho pokes the ball past Tuanzebe, then crosses -- somehow in between four Liverpool players. They still manage to get a shot out of it, and it\u2019s deflected for a corn- ... nope, the spinning ball stays in play. One minute of stoppage time. 44 min: Liverpool corner. Something happens every time I look for a photo to add. Milner\u2019s corner finds the head of van Dijk, but it\u2019s straight at Grant. 43 min: Salah in the middle at the top of the box, out wide to Camacho, cross goes just behind Mane. 42 min: A pile of bodies in midfield, and it\u2019s a free kick 40 yards out for Manchester United. They play it short, then back, then ahead to Liverpool\u2019s keeper. Maybe all the subs can wear red? 40 min: Bailly, the late addition to the United starting lineup, does well to fend off the onrushing Mane. 39 min: Fosu-Mensah attempts to send a clearance out of Michigan Stadium, perhaps hoping for a college football scholarship in case this soccer thing doesn\u2019t work out. (A couple of former Major League Soccer players have done just that. One made the NFL.) Mane falls after a small push in the box. Maybe too theatrical to get a call that might have been harsh in the first place. 37 min: Klavan fouls Alexis rather needlessly at midfield, which is where the game has settled for now after an end-to-end start, er, 5-25 minute mark. Peter Oh writes: \u201cIs it too much to ask to see the Reds play in actual red? This third kit business is about as necessary as a third wheel.\u201d I think this might be the third kit I\u2019ve seen Liverpool wear on this tour alone. This is probably their fourth or fifth kit. If they had more games here, I\u2019d expect to see them in the USA\u2019s old denim stars jersey. 33 min: That was Manchester United\u2019s first shot of the game, to six for Liverpool. Maybe a bit of inexperience by Liverpool\u2019s defense to concede the foul? Let\u2019s see that was ... van Dijk. Oops. Free kick about 28 yards out, and the young Liverpool goalkeeper has a great view as the ball zips past him. Didn\u2019t move, and it probably wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Water break, even though it\u2019s only 26 degrees Celsius / 79 Fahrenheit. That\u2019s as mild as you\u2019ll get before dusk in the USA. Unlucky for Demetri Mitchell, the United defender loaned to Hearts last season, who tried to play the ball but got Salah in the box. Mane coolly slots it to Grant\u2019s right, just out of reach. Will Lee Grant pull a Tim Howard and win the starting job at Manchester United on a U.S. tour? Probably not, but this is pretty good. Manchester United and Real Madrid drew a crowd of nearly 110,000 at this venue four years ago. Seems nearly full again today. 21 min: Liverpool complete 8,390 passes through the United defense, but the final pass is lacking. Repeat. 20 min: Second time Mata has put the ball in the net. Maybe he can\u2019t hear the whistle? 18 min: First email of the day is from one Graham Lees, who writes ... Did Jose just wish Liverpool to do well? I didn\u2019t think so. Yes, Klopp splashed the cash, spending 2+*Coutinho, but Mourinho seems to find other\u2019s ideas for players \u2026 and then stifle them. Pogba seems happier in France than Old Trafford and JM let Salah, de Bruyne, Mata and Matic go? Hmm. He lingerth on his past too much, me thinks. I would love to see Man U as exciting as Liverpool. Currently they are as exciting as England. Oh. So ... Bayern supporter? 15 min: Salah takes the ball away from an unfortunate United defender and plays out to Camacho, who shoots/crosses it to the far post and finds no one. 13 min: Mane and Salah are surely telepathic. The ball gets to Mane near the end line, and he dinks it back to the center for Salah, who can\u2019t quite get enough on his header. At the other end, Kamil Grabara joins the fun and takes a touch under pressure. He\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper today, joining a logjam behind Alisson. Karius? Mignolet? Kelleher? Who knows? 12 min: Grant decides to take a touch under pressure, and the ball sails to Mourinho. No, he hasn\u2019t suited up to play. And this happened: Not sure why such news required a poster. 9 min: CHANCES for Liverpool! First, Mane floats a beautiful ball ahead for Salah between two defenders. The All-World attacker gets his head to it and forces former Stoke keeper Lee Grant into a very good save. Then the corner kick sails to the far post, where Van Dijk gets a head to it and it somehow doesn\u2019t get in under the crossbar. 8 min: Mata puts the ball in the net ... which should probably earn him a yellow card because the whistle had blown for offside an eon earlier. 7 min: Milner gets the ball in the box off a throw-in from Camacho. That would be Liverpool in white, which is confusing because they were wearing some sort of purple earlier in this competition. Basketball game is over, but they\u2019re still talking. Embarrassing. Ian Darke, though, tells us we haven\u2019t missed anything but some \u201ctasty tackles.\u201d One team is in white. Another is in purple. Will update when we know which is which. The \u201cUCLA but it\u2019s not really UCLA because that would surely violate all sorts of NCAA rules\u201d coach just called timeout. Meanwhile, Liverpool have committed three fouls. May we ask who sets the \u201ctarget score\u201d for \u201cThe Basketball Tournament\u201d? I think this is the equivalent of asking me to run a four-minute mile. ESPN says the game is available in its app. It is not. Apparently, those of us watching on ESPN can\u2019t watch until old basketball players manage to score 86 points. That might take a while. The Big House Twitter pictures aren\u2019t doing this place justice. This is the University of Michigan (gridiron) football stadium. Official capacity: 107,601, nearly twice the size of Anfield. Add Ewood Park to Old Trafford, and you\u2019re still not there. Manchester United lineup De Gea, Bailly, Jones, Rojo, Valencia, Lindelof, Pogba, Martial, Lingard, Young, Matic, Rashford, Fellaini ... ... are all unavailable. Here\u2019s the actual lineup ... Liverpool lineup Similar to what we\u2019ve seen so far in the International Champions Cup apart from young Polish goalkeeper Kamil Grabara. It\u2019s a first start in this year\u2019s ICC for Mane, Salah, Klavan, Moreno, Solanke and Camacho, and we\u2019re expecting to get our first look at Shaqiri. No Karius, Clyne, Wijnaldum, Keita or Matip, and still no Lovren, Firmino, Henderson, Mignolet, Ings, Alexander-Arnold or Alisson. Good afternoon/evening ... Are you adequately prepared to see a massive crowd in one of the largest stadiums on the planet watching stars like Kamil Grabara and Scott McTominay? Will post lineups next ... Beau will be here shortly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
