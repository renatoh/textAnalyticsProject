The Democratic Republic of the Congo international surprised Everton on Monday when he activated a break clause in a season-long loan deal with Aston Villa to return to Merseyside. The 29-year-old, who struggled to secure a regular starting place at the Championship club, did not inform Silva in advance of his decision and adds an extra \u00a370,000 to Everton\u2019s weekly wage bill. Bolasie indicated he returned to restart his career in the Premier League but that appears unlikely under Silva. He may get that opportunity at Palace, who sold him to Everton for \u00a325m in 2016 and are weighing up a reunion on loan this month. Middlesbrough and China are also possible destinations for a player who finds himself behind Richarlison, Bernard, Ademola Lookman and Theo Walcott as Silva\u2019s wide options. The Everton manager said: \u201cIt is a possibility of course [another loan]. Until now we have had no enquiries. We will do what is the best solution for him and us as a club. We have four wingers in our squad and we are happy with them. What I don\u2019t want is for Bolasie not to play again. It doesn\u2019t mean I have already decided what will happen. Let\u2019s see what will happen at the end of the market. When he took the decision to come back we didn\u2019t expect it, even though he has that option in his contract.\u201d When it was put to Silva that Bolasie is unlikely to find game time at Everton, the manager replied: \u201cFor sure, he knows. I took that decision last summer, because I realised it would be difficult for him to get the minutes he wants.\u201d Everton must sell to buy in this window and Bolasie\u2019s salary is an additional obstacle to signings, although Silva has dismissed the idea of Idrissa Gana Gueye joining Paris Saint-Germain. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have one offer,\u201d the manager said. \u201cNot one club made one offer for Gana, official offer, and nothing to our club. He is focused on our club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
