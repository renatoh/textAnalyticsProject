But like all first steps, the steps are difficult and they are hard. I know what we really need is a legally binding treaty as quickly as possible.\" Barack Obama, US president: \"I think it is important that instead of setting up a bunch of goals that just end up not being met, that we get moving. We just keep moving forward.\" Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary general: \"We have sealed the deal. This accord cannot be everything that everyone hoped for, but it is an essential beginning.\" Yvo de Boer, of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: \"We now have a package to work with and begin immediate action. However, we need to be clear that it is a letter of intent and is not precise about what needs to be done in legal terms. So the challenge is now to turn what we have agreed politically in Copenhagen into something real, measurable and verifiable.\" Lumumba Di-Aping, chairman of the G77 group of 130 poor countries: \"[This] is asking Africa to sign a suicide pact, an incineration pact in order to maintain the economic dependence of a few countries. It's a solution based on values that funnelled six million people in Europe into furnaces.\" Robert Bailey, of Oxfam International: \"World leaders had a genuine chance here in Copenhagen to deliver the fair, ambitious and binding deal the world needed. But as the deal got cooked up, fairness was taken off the table and ambition watered down. In the early hours of the morning, any hopes of a legally binding deal were stripped out too. It is too late to save the summit, but it's not too late to save the planet and its people. We have no choice but to forge forward towards a legally binding deal in 2010. This must be a rapid, decisive and ambitious movement, not business as usual.\" Kim Carstensen, of WWF: \"Well-meant but half-hearted pledges to protect our planet from dangerous climate change are simply not sufficient to address a crisis that calls for completely new ways of collaboration across rich and poor countries. Millions of lives, hundreds of billions of dollars and a wealth of lost opportunities lie in the difference between rhetoric and reality on climate change action. We needed a treaty now and at best, we will be working on one in half a year's time. What we have after two years of negotiation is a half-baked text of unclear substance.\" Andy Atkins, of Friends of the Earth: \"This toothless declaration that the US is spinning as a success is a sham \u2013 this agreement won't stop a two degree rise in temperature, and as it stands condemns millions of the world's poorest people to hunger, suffering and loss of life as climate change accelerates. We need a profound change of approach from the world's wealthiest countries to secure a genuine, strong and fair agreement. No more greenwashing and no more empty promises.\" Nelson Muffuh, of Christian Aid: \"We hoped that sanity would prevail but powerful nations didn't come to negotiate. They came to play hardball. Lives will be lost as a result. Already more than 300,000 people a year die as a result of climate change. That number will go up. The failure was the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility for global warming.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
