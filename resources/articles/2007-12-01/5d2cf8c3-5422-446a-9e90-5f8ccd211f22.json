Indeed, Stoke are reluctant to acclaim themselves. \"We've matched West Brom with commitment, energy, good pace and power and a togetherness that has pushed this club forward,\" said their manager, Tony Pulis, but he made no mention of their footballing qualities. Ricardo Fuller, who showed admirable composure in scoring a hat-trick, struck a similar note: \"We work hard, out-battle teams and out-run teams. That's what we do at Stoke City.\" The procurement of eight points from their four encounters with West Brom, Watford and Charlton Athletic, the most-fancied trio in the Championship, indicates it is a successful formula. The table - with Stoke sitting fourth, one point behind Albion, who occupy an automatic promotion place - indicates that their rightful place is in that company. Not that compliments flowed from the West Brom manager, Tony Mowbray. Mixing monosyllabic responses with barely veiled comments, he implied Albion were the moral victors. While teams are often thought to reflect their managers, an expressive Albion side is at odds with Mowbray's dour persona, and he was in a particularly grouchy mood. \"I saw what I saw,\" he said, a phrase he repeated with the frequency of a conspiracy theorist. \"I saw my team playing some decent football.\" Robert Koren and Jonathan Greening did instigate a series of elegant passing moves, but Albion's goal, bundled in by Roman Bednar, was the ugliest of the afternoon. Though Albion's reputation is as the Championship equivalent of Arsenal while Bryan Robson recently likened Stoke to the Wimbledon side of two decades' ago, it would be simplistic to brand this a contest of the beautiful against the beastly. Fuller's third goal, a wondrous solo run, was much the best of the match. Alongside him, the foreboding Mamady Sidibe is a suitably frightening successor to John Fashanu in the ranks of the intimidating centre-forwards. The unsettled central defensive duo of Bostjan Cesar and Pedro Pele, who comprised Albion's soft underbelly, had little response to Sidibe, the supplier of Fuller's opener. \"My job is different now because the manager wants me to drop deep and let Ricardo get in the box. I'm playing more [in] midfield than striker,\" said the Malian. Though he hardly qualifies as a delicate playmaker in his withdrawn role, Fuller is a grateful beneficiary of his industry. Fuller's signing of an extended deal until 2011 is an indication of new-found buoyancy, with the Britannia Stadium being purchased by chairman Peter Coates. Recently, they have been paupers compared to some of their rivals and have struggled to retain players with Michael Duberry and Danny Higginbotham prominent departures this year. As Pulis assessed his resources against Mowbray's on Saturday, he said of Fuller's new contract: \"It's the first time in two spells I've been manager that the club has gone to a player who has got 18 months left and offered him a new contract.\" The Jamaican striker has scored five goals in two games since agreeing his contract. \"I don't work to live, I live to play football. Money's important but it's not everything,\" he said. \"Ricardo likes it here,\" added Pulis. \"He's very well liked in the dressing room and that's important to him.\" The manager and his charges, however, are flourishing without similar appreciation. Man of the match Ricardo Fuller Pulis believes the speedy Jamaican could prosper in the Premier League. How Albion could have benefited from a striker offering such incisiveness.
