There is our short cut under Orion, hunting down to where the town begins. Please, can't we stay here in comfort on our terrace punctuated by hibiscus and diluted sangria, talking of pelicans under the patterns cast by pierced metal stars? How much might it cost us to wait for a taxi? Falter through the gate to a bougainvillea path lit only by pale bracts, pressed memories of moons. Dusk comes steeper than we're accustomed to. Where is the applause of the sea at sunset? Manufactured waterfalls are still too near, under the stucco fa\u00e7ade where men dangled themselves from old ropes over a precipice like this one, bristling with rebar. Take my hand. Thank you, my heart. Just one more flight of steps left now; we're past the overgrowth where wild roosters mocked us into morning. Mind the low awning outside that store locked full of chameleon vases, silver eyes. Delicious on the waterfront at Las Palomas, we arrive believing the fortissimo gossip of orange trumpet vines. Salvador offers us the special. Take this glass, drown the cutlery with azure fire and let us spend tomorrow's hummingbirds. Already, a meteor melts on my tongue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
