The car with a radio that's got a mind of its own", "bodyText": "Anne Johnson's six-year-old Seat Ibiza has a remarkable feature: its radio. This lively gadget can switch itself on and off at will and change channels when it fancies, whether or not the engine is running. The suspense might be thrilling when Johnson is driving, but when the car is parked these antics can drain the battery. Oddly, Johnson's mother also owns a Seat Ibiza and her radio has the same independence. And, if you search the web, so do the radios of numbers of other Seat Ibiza owners who bought their cars around 2001. Since then, Johnson has learned, the manufacturer has diagnosed and corrected the problem and she maintains that she is entitled to a new radio unit since her car is now almost useless. \"My partner removed the fuse for the radio because it kept draining the battery,\" she says, \"but because it was part of an integrated system, the heating, ventilation and other things now don't work.\" Seat, however, insists that since her car is out of warranty it cannot help. Car manufacturers are not noted for their soft hearts and in this case Seat has a legal right to refuse Johnson, whose warranty expired three years ago. Consumer law does offer protection over and above warranty if goods are deemed unfit for their purpose and the complaint is made within a reasonable time, but unhappily for Johnson, the Statute of Limitations absolves companies from responsibility from six years after the purchase. And given that Johnson had six years of use of her vehicle before the radio began playing up, she doesn't have a claim, even if the fault might be a manufacturing one. Unfair as it sounds, she will have to buy a new radio herself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
