One moment, he is bullish enough to say he can see no dangers to Delegator in the Guineas a week on Saturday, the next he is whipping out a nervous cigarette and describing his relief that the horse was able to win a straightforward trial race last week. Maybe it was the effect of the sun that lit up the glorious Wiltshire countryside here yesterday but Meehan's confidence seems to be getting the upper hand over his nerves. At one point, he made this stunning claim on behalf of Delegator and Crowded House, his Derby favourite: \"It's on the cards that both these horses are going to win a Group One this year, probably two apiece, maybe three apiece.\" \"I don't expect [Delegator] to get beaten in the Guineas,\" he added, before describing his total faith in the colt before his seasonal debut in last Thursday's Craven Stakes. \"We knew he was very well \u2013 wherever he was gonna go, he was gonna win. It won't be as easy as that on Guineas day . . . or maybe it will.\" Despite such bold assertions, Meehan admits he was able to relax a little after the Craven went to plan but denies taking anything for granted. \"We're so far away from winning an English Classic right now as we stand here \u2013 we just happen to have two good horses.\" Until recently, there was a chance that those good horses would clash in the Guineas, but Crowded House will now wait for the Dante Stakes on 14 May. Delegator, meanwhile, is no bigger than 7-2 for the first Classic of the season, having been 25-1 until a particularly impressive gallop sent his odds tumbling a fortnight ago. Meehan has too much tact to reveal the identity of the horse against which Delegator was so impressive but it is believed to have been Crowded House himself. \"They may just do a little breeze together on Thursday,\" Meehan said, \"but what you would never do, and what we never have done, is take them both out there and try and find out which one is better. You're at cross-purposes there, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Last year, they probably worked a lot together but you're never trying to find out who's better than what. That's not my job, it's not what I'm here to do.\" Crowded House has since done his own impressive piece of work, on an undulating stretch known as the Derby gallop \u2013 so called, apparently, because so many Derby winners have worked there in Manton's 150-year history, rather than because it resembles Epsom. He is a best price of 6-1 for this year's race, after which Meehan intends to return him to 10 furlongs, with the Eclipse, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Classic named as potential targets. In the meantime, Meehan is doing his best to make sure Delegator gets his ground next week. Newmarket's clerk of the course, Michael Prosser, also here yesterday, received regular reminders about the need to water his track. \"If it's firm, we'll take him over for a nice weekend in Paris,\" said Meehan, alluding to the French Guineas. He was only half-joking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
