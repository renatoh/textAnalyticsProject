Pinned down by heavy fire, Lieutenant Norton got to his feet and, alone, charged the German concrete gun emplacements. He attacked the first of the strongholds with his sub-machine-gun, dispatching three of its crew, then went on to knock out two more emplacements, capturing or killing 15 of the enemy. During the whole of this action, which lasted mere minutes, Norton came under heavy fire from an enemy self-propelled gun. Later, in another action, and despite being wounded while trying to rescue a colleague, he went on to clear the cellar and upper rooms of a house, taking several more prisoners and putting others to flight. Although weak from loss of blood, Norton continued to lead his platoon calmly and resolutely up the valley, where they succeeded in taking the remaining enemy positions. In the words of the official citation for the VC, published the following October, \"Lieutenant Norton displayed matchless courage, outstanding initiative and inspiring leadership. By his supreme gallantry, fearless example and determined aggression, he assured the successful breach of the Gothic Line at this point.\" \"Toys\" Norton, whose forebears emigrated from Hythe, Kent, to South Africa in the 1820s, was born in Herschel, Cape Province where his father, Charles, was an assistant magistrate. Educated at Selborne college, East London, where he acquired his nickname, he was a keen sportsman excelling at cricket, rugby and tennis. After school, he joined Barclays bank at Umtata, taking the opportunity to widen his sporting interests by adding badminton, squash, golf and hockey to his tally. He also fitted in two years of peacetime soldiering with the Middellandse regiment. After a short spell working in the Johannesburg branch of his bank, he returned to East London. On the outbreak of war he transferred to the Kaffrarian rifles. It was while serving as a sergeant with this regiment that Norton was awarded a Military Medal. During the withdrawal of the 8th Army from the Gazala line in June 1942, part of the rearguard of the 1st South African division was cut off on the desert coast road east of Tobruk. Norton, with five comrades, was posted missing, believed captured. In fact, the small group had taken to the desert in a cross-country truck. After 100 miles, they ran out of petrol but, determined not to \"go in the bag\", the party embarked on a remarkable 470-mile, 38-day trek until they found a route through the German lines and managed to rejoin the 8th Army defence line near the Egyptian border. Following recuperation in Cairo, Norton returned to South Africa to join an officers' training course - although he had twice before resisted all attempts to get him to accept a commission. On his return to Egypt, he joined the British army. At this point, there were so many officers in the South African division that his only means back into the line was to transfer. Norton joined the 1st/4th battalion of the Hampshire regiment, then fighting in Italy. Following the actions at Monte Gridolfo, Norton recovered from his wounds at the South African base hospital at Bari where he met up with his twin sister, Olga, who was serving on the staff. Norton received his VC from King George VI at an investiture at Holyroodhouse. Promoted captain on December 1 1944, Norton served with the Hampshires for the remainder of the Italian campaign. He then spent four months with the occupation forces in Greece before being transferred to Austria. Norton returned only briefly, before moving to what was then Rhodesia the following year. He bought a 4,000-acre tobacco plantation some 100 miles from the then Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, which he ran until 1985, when he sold up and went to live with a daughter and son-in-law on their 3,000-acre farm at Trelawney about 60 miles from the capital. In November 2002, the family was evicted from the farm and went to live in a flat in the suburbs of Harare. Norton, always reticent about his wartime exploits, was not the sort of man who expected, or would have wanted, any favours or special treatment because of his VC. Asked to comment when news of his family's eviction from their farm appeared in the British press, he replied: \"I certainly don't expect preferential treatment. I doubt Mugabe even knows what a VC is\". \"Toys\" Norton's death reduces to 14 the number of living holders of the VC. His wife, Lilla Ellen Morris, whom he married in South Africa in 1943, and by whom he had three daughters, predeceased him. \u00b7Gerard Ross Norton, soldier. born September 7 1915; died October 29 2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
