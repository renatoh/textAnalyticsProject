Literally \u2013 anyone looking for a haggard face bespeaking untold sleepless nights at the national hell he unleashed will go away disappointed \u2013 and figuratively. Everything he says is still carefully measured. He becomes impassioned, when called for, to the precise degree warranted. The voice may rise in pitch, but never in volume. His entire mien reminds you of the Gertrude Stein comment on her by-then-demolished childhood home \u2013 there is no \u201cthere\u201d there. In short, it turns out there is even less to miss about David Cameron than you thought. Nevertheless, he has a book to sell (by many accounts, the 752-page tome sure ain\u2019t shifting on its own) and we are a nation of masochists, so the BBC has served up The Cameron Years (BBC One). This first of two parts covered just the last years of his premiership. But, y\u2019know, they were busy ones. The basic story was largely told in captions you could still read as your head sank ever lower in despair. \u201cCameron leads the Conservatives to their first outright victory since 1992.\u201d Renegotiations with the EU \u201care complicated by a growing migrant crisis\u201d. \u201cCameron gathers allies for the fight ahead\u201d in 2016 \u2026 Ah, those allies. \u201cAllies\u201d. You can probably start sprinkling quotation marks with a fairly liberal hand from hereon out. Michael Gove turns up to tell us that \u201cin my heart [\u2018heart\u2019], I was one of those who thought it was wrong to enter the EU in the first place\u201d, and how this led him to put the boot into his friend, leader and \u2013 you could say \u2013 country. Iain Duncan Smith, whose head-tilt is in its fathomless arrogance such a potent inducer of rage-strokes that it amounts to a public health issue, is on hand to assure us that he told Cameron four months before the referendum that the prime minister had made a mistake. \u201cI told him \u2026 \u2018Things will never be the same again,\u2019 I said.\u201d That bookending of his oracular self, man \u2013 that\u2019s a character note to end all character notes. (The whole hour was a linguist\u2019s dream, by the way. Whoever was speaking, the slippage of pronouns, often in the same sentence, from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d to \u201cyou\u201d \u2013 as either truth or the desire to escape it crept closer \u2013 was remarkable, and the passive voice got a workout from which it will be recovering for months.) It was at this point that the programme\u2019s fatal flaw began to make itself impossible to ignore. Which was: the politicians were being allowed to speak. What, really, is the point of that? We are still in the middle of the events whose origins, and the parts they played in those origins, they are describing. There is no distance or detachment here; no honest or clear-eyed analysis; nothing recollected in equanimity. Everyone still has much to lose. Everyone is still as engaged as they ever were in the game of self-serving multidimensional chess that is domestic politics. For anyone not already minutely informed about the events, personal relationships and professional powerplays at work, such a programme\u2019s main effect is simply to allow a different layer of dishonesty to be overlaid on what has gone before. We are all just watching a palimpsest of lies grow. If the aim of The Cameron Years is education and illumination, it would have been better to stick with footage from the time and examine the lies (or truths, should they occur) the players told then rather than give airtime to fresh lies or reinterpretations of their actions and utterances back in the day. If that\u2019s not the aim \u2013 if it is, as it seems to be, one of those shows given to people in Cameron\u2019s position almost as of right, granting the viewer the thrill of seeing a slightly different version of the man we knew as prime minister, in return for him getting to try to mould his legacy into something more palatable \u2013 then it is time for a rethink. In an age of \u201cfake news\u201d, shifting sands and vanishing facts, we need to revisit the natural-seeming ways of many things. Former leaders burnishing their book sales via BBC showcases may need to be one thing that goes. In the closing minutes, Cameron was pressed, slightly. He said he was \u201csorry\u201d about \u201csome of the things that have happened\u201d and that he does \u201cfeel regret for some of the decisions and choices that I made\u201d. His interviewer asked: \u201cRemorse as well?\u201d A pause. \u201cI feel regret about what happened, and there are things that, if you had your time again, you\u2019d do differently.\u201d And that\u2019s the best we\u2019re going to get, I\u2019m afraid, in this crazy, mixed-up, pronoun-shifting world that we? We? \u201cWe\u201d \u2013 have made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
