First though, Pardew had to survive a baptism of boos as an underwhelmed 51,000 audience greeted his first appearance in the dug out with a cacophony of disapproval. \"It wasn't a very pleasant reception,\" said Hughton's successor. \"But I understand that.\" Happily for Pardew, goals do not merely change games but entire moods. With 15 minutes on the clock, as Kevin Nolan celebrated giving Newcastle the lead with a now trademark \"funky chicken\" dance routine, a relieved home manager relaxed. Thanks largely to an outstanding performance from Andy Carroll, the rest of the game was not overly traumatic. Even so, Pardew seemed close to losing his voice. \"The noise level was something I've only experienced in cup finals,\" he said. \"Getting my message out was difficult, I'll have to learn sign language.\" On this evidence, he is communicating just fine. \"To get three goals was something special,\" said a manager who had admitted to reservations about accepting the job. \"I was a bit nervous; you need the group to be with you but the players made it easy for me when I met them and I felt a lot better about things.\" Sensing the atmosphere, the crowd ultimately switched from pre-match militancy and post kick-off rumblings of discontent to full-on encouragement. \"In the end, Newcastle fans gave their team incredible support,\" said Roy Hodgson, Liverpool's rueful manager. \"I'm sure it buoyed them.\" Pardew was delighted. \"The crowd were understandably disappointed about losing Chris [Hughton] but ultimately they support the shirt and the club,\" he said. \"And the team showed their spirit and unity and individual talent; we have four or five outstanding players.\" Nolan is among them and, as he began that silly dance, Pardew knew all the talk of a mutinous dressing room had been rather over-egged. Granted, Newcastle's squad harbour great affection for Hughton but they will surely view this latest upheaval on Tyneside as a case of the king is dead; long live the king. Fans, though, are a very different matter and earlier hundreds of locals had demonstrated peacefully outside the ground's main reception, chanting \"Cockney Mafia out\" and, among other much ruder things, \"Hughton is a Geordie\" and \"Get out of our club\". Mike Ashley's only solace was that the protesters looked extremely young. Significantly, their 30-, 40- and 50-something seniors inside the stadium, albeit still disgruntled, proved slightly more polite as they waved home-made \"Thank you Chris\" banners. Accordingly, once Joey Barton's 15th-minute free-kick was headed on by Carroll before dropping kindly for Nolan to score, the fear of things turning ugly abated. It might have been different had Tim Krul not saved well from Sotirios Kyrgiakos early on or had Fernando Torres better struck an inviting free-kick won when he fell over in the face of Sol Campbell, but Pardew's luck held. Admittedly, there were a few nervous moments. Early in the second half, for instance, a long ball hit Campbell on the head before falling to Dirk Kuyt's right foot. Kuyt switched it on to his left, took a swipe and the ball deflected off Steven Taylor into the back of the net. No matter; Pardew introduced Nile Ranger from the bench and the impressive youngster swiftly made a difference, ruffling Hodgson's side with a dangerous strike that went fractionally wide. Ranger also helped Barton restore the lead. When Carroll provoked pandemonium by heading on a long ball, the substitute and a marker tussled, allowing the ball to drop for Barton to toe home. Up in the stand, Ashley literally danced for joy. Newcastle's best, namely a fabulous long-range, stoppage-time shot into the bottom corner from Carroll after Liverpool's defence inexplicably backed off, was reserved until last. \"It's a major setback,\" said Hodgson, sensing a crisis blowing out of Tyneside and on to Merseyside. \"A major blow.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT DAVID HOLMES, Observer reader In the end we deserved to win, but when Liverpool got their equaliser I thought there was only one team going to win it and that was them. But then Joey Barton scored a goal that was completely down to his own sheer determination, and that changed the match. Carroll's was a fantastic goal from out of nowhere, and that was it. We shouldn't have let them have their goal \u2013 I thought Campbell had a really bad game for us. But it's always nice to get a win against Liverpool. The fan's player ratings Krul 6; Simpson 6, Taylor 6, Campbell 3, Enrique 6; Barton 8 (Routledge 90 n/a), Nolan 7 (Smith 87 n/a), Tiote 7, Guti\u00e9rrez 5; Ameobi 5 (Ranger 63 7), Carroll 7 STEPHEN EELEY, Observer reader It was our poor second half that will linger in the memory the longest. Before half-time Liverpool looked capable of scoring at any point, despite going behind. We thought we'd win it once we'd got to 1-1 \u2013 then after that, nothing happened. Liverpool just stopped pressing and Torres was pretty disappointing other than one or two brilliant touches. And we missed Gerrard in a game like this \u2013 Kuyt and Johnson were our best players. I was sitting among Newcastle's fans and they weren't expecting to win beforehand either.
