Innovation is vital in any sport, but commuting to a major tournament is a new one on me. We've been scanning the Indian newspapers on the internet, hoping for news of mass flight cancellations and endless train delays. India begin as slight favourites under Premadasa's floodlights tomorrow, but a few hours packed into a sweltering and overcrowded Indian train, preferably one of those that should be sponsored by Right Guard, should wear them out a bit. I reckon this commuting lark could catch on, especially as Caddy is about to get his helicopter pilots' licence. He is already talking about flying up from Somerset to next year's Old Trafford Test, landing at Worsley, just off the M62, and getting one of the lads to drive him to the ground. Leeds might also be worth considering - coming down in the middle of the outfield would be a clever way of avoiding any hassle from the Headingley gatemen. While the likes of Sachin and Sourav were tucking into a hearty family meals, the England coach was crawling down Galle Road, trapped in the middle of Colombo's kite-flying ceremony. There were thousands of people there, wandering round with their kids. As someone remarked at the back of the coach: \"Not done that for a while.\" So we all keep in touch with rushed phone calls, faxes and e-mails. The Iranis have just moved house, which explains the fax I got from Lorraine this week. It went: \"Finished mountains of ironing, curtain man finishes Friday, plumbing man back today to show me how to work the central heating.\" And there I was, chasing a few minutes of fame with four wickets against Zimbabwe, chuffed to bits that I'd dismissed my Essex mate, Andy Flower, and agonising over which particularly fine restaurant I might celebrate the achievement in the following day. I got a bit lucky with the wicket of Guy Whittall. It seemed worth a shout as I struck him on the pad, and Steve Bucknor called up the TV umpire to check whether the ball had struck the pad before the bat. It certainly had, so Whittall had to go. Fortunately, the new regulations didn't allow Dave Orchard, the TV umpire, to tip off Steve Bucknor that the Irani wonderball had actually struck Whittall outside off-stump. Talk about having to let down your mates. I'm with Nasser in believing that, at the highest level, this technology should be used to the full. Don't just tinker around the edges; let the on-field umpire take as much advice as he wants. I would definitely use Hawkeye - the system that tracks the ball from the bowler's hand to the batsman and then predicts whether it would have hit the stumps. It might not be quite 100%, but Hawkeye is better than the human eye. And why have we abandoned the red and green lights? They built up the tension. Now we have the umpire wandering around the outfield, talking into his walkie-talkie, like a bloke looking for better mobile reception. And have you noticed how the England boys react when an appeal is referred to the third umpire? You can't celebrate in case it is given not out. So Nass wandered up from mid-off to politely shake Hoggy by the hand. Wow, 1950s or what? I thought I was playing with Peter May and Trevor Bailey. Mum and Dad - Anne and Jimmy - have flown out from Bolton to watch the tournament. They're typical Northerners on holiday. You would have thought they would have been thrilled to see their lad make a hundred in the warm-up against Bangladesh and then knock over Zimbabwe with four wickets. But that couldn't remotely compare with their excitement at wandering around the Mount Lavinia Hotel and bumping into Gail Tilsley from Coronation Street. She's out here to save some elephants or something. Since I moved to Essex, I've had to become an EastEnders man myself. Nass used to go to school with Ian Beale, who runs the EastEnders chippy. Not too sure if he's into saving elephants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
