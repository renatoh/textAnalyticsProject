It was an unlikely canonisation for a composer who had hovered around the fringes of the European mainstream for more than two decades. During that time his music had moved from fashionable radicalism to a style of spiritual contemplation that found a resonance with a public already held in thrall by Tavener and Part. Yet since that success Gorecki has continued to compose slowly - just a handful of choral works, none of them large scale. But the cantata that received its British premiere at the Proms on Saturday is substantial; Salve, Sidus Polonorum was commissioned for Expo 2000 in Hanover, and scored for a large chorus in eight parts, an organ, two pianos and a battery of metallic percussion. It was designed as a three-part tribute to Polish bishop St Adalbert, who was martyred at the end of the 10th century, and is now the patron saint of Bohemia. The writing is largely diatonic, with dissonances strictly rationed; the choral writing moves in blocks of rhythmic unison, with the tintinnabulating ensemble adding a halo of resonances to the climaxes. It is uncomplicated, designed to be emotionally direct, and almost liturgical in its intentions. Salve, Sidus Polonorum was the centrepiece of a late-night programme given by the BBC Symphony Chorus and members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Stephen Jackson, flanked by choral Sch\u00fctz, Brahms and Schoenberg, with Stravinsky's Concerto for Two Pianos to add some astringency. It provided welcome seriousness after the earlier concert of the evening, with the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Barry Wordsworth in a routinely played sequence of \"popular classics\", which laid a strong claim to being the most unnecessary programme in the season. There had been choral music of a very different cut to begin Friday's fine concert from the BBC Symphony Orchestra with Esa-Pekka Salonen. More than 30 years old now, Ligeti's Requiem is everything that Gorecki's piece is not - thrilling, intense, unexpected, and ravishingly beautiful in an utterly original way. Caroline Stein and Charlotte Hellekant were the vivid, quasi-operatic soloists, London Voices the utterly secure choir.
