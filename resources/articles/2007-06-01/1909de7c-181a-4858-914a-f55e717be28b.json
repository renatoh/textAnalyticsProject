The Outsider Festival in the Cairngorms national park (outsiderfestival.co.uk) is offering mountain biking, bushcraft sessions, astronomy and climbing. From July 7-22, Hackney Empire is hosting the second annual Spice Festival, featuring 60 events covering art, comedy, drama, roller disco, clubbing, cabaret and poetry (spicefestival.co.uk). If you missed the Hay Festival, you might want to check out Ways with Words, a 10-day literary festival at Dartington Hall, just outside Totnes in Devon from July 6-16. This year's line-up includes Melvin Bragg, Edna and Denis Healey, Sandi Toksvig, Alain de Botton, John Snow and Jim Broadbent (waywithwords.co.uk). The excellently named Mintfest is a new festival devoted to street arts in - yes, you've guessed it - Kendal. If you hate those live statue performers, it's probably best avoided; if, on the other hand, your party trick is juggling, you'll probably love it (August 31-September 2, mintfest.org)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
