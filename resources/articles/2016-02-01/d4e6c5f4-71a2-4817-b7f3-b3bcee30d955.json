But with the England coach, Eddie Jones, threatening to gag himself and his Wales counterpart Warren Gatland rationing his media commitments to the team announcement, which may be two days before the match at Twickenham next week, the sound of silence is about to break out. Five years ago, Gatland tried to wind up the England hooker Dylan Hartley before the sides met in Cardiff, suggesting his fellow New Zealander was volatile, but there will be no repeat in the next 12 days even though the forward is now England\u2019s captain and has substantially added to his list of suspensions since then. \u201cIt will be nice to get out there and have a little tussle with him,\u201d the Wales hooker Scott Baldwin said. \u201cI will not be looking to wind him up \u2013 that is not part of my game. If I am selected, I will look forward to a tough battle against a good player. \u201cHe has shown his maturity since being appointed England captain. A few things have been said about him but he has not bitten whereas he may have done in the past. He is an aggressive player who wants to do well for his country and he has led from the front for his side. His core skills for a hooker are on the money: he is good in the scrums and lineouts and he gets around the park, carrying and making tackles. He is an all-round player who does his job.\u201d The title race will be over if England beat Wales and France fail to overcome Scotland at Murrayfield the following day, while a Wales victory would leave them needing to defeat Italy in Cardiff on the final day of the tournament to clinch their fourth championship under Gatland. On two of the three previous occasions, they have won at Twickenham on the way and in 2013 thrashed England in Cardiff to oust them from the top on points difference. \u201cWe know the task we face,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cEngland are a tough team at home and we were stung there two years ago. They will be motivated by our victory at Twickenham in the World Cup because most of their players were involved then and they are building as a team. Eddie Jones has given them confidence but we are building as well and it should be an exciting match. \u201cWe know that beating England would set us up with a game against Italy to win the title and we are not going to be resting on the World Cup win over them a few months ago. We were probably a bit lucky to get away with that as we were not on the money for the first 20 or so minutes. Although we did beat France on Friday, that performance brought us back down to earth because it showed we need to improve.\u201d Wales laboured for long periods against France at the Principality Stadium, their one try, scored by George North, a comedy of errors by the visitors in attack and defence. While England showed an ability to get the ball wide against Ireland the following day, Wales struggled to make the final pass in a move count. \u201cThere were seven-pointers that we did not finish and sometimes they can bite you in the backside later in the game,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cThere were some dubious decisions against us, especially in the first half, but you get those in matches and you have to work around the interpretations of a referee. \u201cWe have stuff to work on but that is good when you face a massive challenge such as Twickenham. We are happy with the way our set pieces are going and I thought we were good around the field against France with the forwards hitting rucks and the half-backs steering us around the field. It was a positive night for us but there is always room for improvement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
