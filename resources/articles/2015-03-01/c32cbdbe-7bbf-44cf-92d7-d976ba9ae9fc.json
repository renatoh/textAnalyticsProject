His new team-mates were so bewitched they broke into spontaneous applause. Harry Kane eased himself in less spectacularly but, again, there hardly seems to have been a flicker of apprehension. Rooney has 101 caps, is closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s goals record of 49 and before training he was presented with the England player\u2011of\u2011the-year award. Then the practice session started on the blowy pitches at St George\u2019s Park and the little piece of paper in Roy Hodgson\u2019s hand firmed up the view that England will have a new-look attack in Friday\u2019s game against Lithuania. The names of Rooney and Kane were alongside one another and both were circled. Kane will surely start England\u2019s latest Euro 2016 qualifier and his presence has certainly enlivened the sense of occasion. \u201cWe\u2019ve had only the one training session but you can see he\u2019s got real presence,\u201d Michael Carrick said of his new colleague. \u201cI think he\u2019s been sensational. If you look at the start of the season to now he\u2019s jumped up a couple of levels at least. He\u2019s maybe gone up two or three levels.\u201d For now, Kane has been excused an audience with the media, the Football Association\u2019s thinking being that he should not be overexposed. Everything Kane has done over the past few months indicates the 21-year-old would have handled it with no issue but there is a legitimate argument that if he is hyped too much the pressure on him to excel on his international debut could become a considerable weight. \u201cI do really hope people have a reasoned approach and give this guy a chance,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe is going to have some good games and some bad games and hopefully he has 10 to 12 years of potential England matches in front of him. Let\u2019s not build him up to be the best thing we have ever had or a flop on the basis of a month or two or a couple of games. Give the lad a chance.\u201d Gary Cahill made the same point but even then the warning came attached with a eulogy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cHe\u2019s still a young boy and being in the senior squad, with big players you don\u2019t really know, can be daunting. It is easy to talk up a young player too much and I think we do that a lot in this country. But for me he has everything. \u201cHe can hold the ball up, he runs in behind, he has two good feet, he can head, he can finish, he has a bit of pace. Physically, he is strong enough. He has all the attributes and he has had a fantastic season. To meet up with the England squad for the first time, coming off the back of a hat-trick \u2013 his confidence must be absolutely sky high.\u201d Cahill has personal experience of the damage Kane can wreak on defences, having been part of the Chelsea team who were beaten 5-3 by Tottenham at White Hart Lane on New Year\u2019s Day. Kane scored twice, set up another, won a penalty and caused Cahill and John Terry more problems than any other player this season. \u201cI\u2019ve played against him three times and he has been a real handful but on that day in particular he was fantastic,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s like a Gabby Agbonlahor but he\u2019s powerful in his running. He is quick, a powerful boy and physically more than capable of playing in this league. The attributes are all there and he deserves his place in the squad.\u201d Does he deserve to start? Cahill is in the camp that says yes and it has reached the point where it would be more of a shock if a player with 29 goals this season was kept back. Wembley is sold out and Kane is the obvious draw. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four top strikers all chomping at the bit to play and I\u2019m sure he would relish the opportunity,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cThat will be down to the manager but, for me, yes he\u2019s ready to play.\u201d Carrick, now the oldest player in Hodgson\u2019s squad, has the same view. \u201cSometimes you see young players who have a good spell and then drop away, but I just don\u2019t see that with him. You can see the progression. As the spotlight has grown on him, as he\u2019s been talked about more and given more praise, and as defenders have started becoming more aware of him, he\u2019s actually taken his game on and on. That is what has impressed me the most. At the weekend he had a big call-up and then you see him score a hat-trick. It\u2019s a good sign, as if he thrives on that little bit of pressure and expectation.\u201d Carrick, 33, also made the point that England under Hodgson is generally a welcoming environment for new players. In different times, cliques have existed between the Manchester United and Liverpool contingents. The players will say that is no longer the case. \u201cThe squad now is an easy one to come into,\u201d Carrick said. \u201cWe were talking about that between ourselves this morning. There\u2019s a really good atmosphere. It\u2019s almost like a club atmosphere. Go into the dressing room and the feeling is quite bubbly, energetic, but relaxed at the same time. So hopefully it\u2019s an easy place to settle into and thrive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
