For Chambers it was an emotional moment. As the realisation of his achievement sank in \u2013 his first ever senior world title \u2013 the former drugs cheat who has turned his life around blew out his cheeks, relieved and irrepressibly happy. Over 60m it had not been an easy victory, the American Mike Rodgers pushing him all the way. \"I'm just glad it's over,\" said Chambers, \"that was the hardest six seconds of my life. We were all giving each other the eyeball in the call-up room so I knew it was going to be very tense out there. I thought, 'this is not going to be easy'. All I could do was just relax, let them panic and try not to panic myself.\" Flashing a grin that refused to go away the 31-year-old, recipient of $40,000 in prize money \u2013 though 25% of that will go toward paying back prize money earned while on drugs \u2013 won in 6.48 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year. He has run faster, of course, 6.42 to take gold at the European indoors last year, but during the race the thought of going for Maurice Greene's world record of 6.39 interfered with his rhythm. \"It was in my mind,\" said Chambers, \"midway through the race Michael Rodgers came up on my side and I thought, 'argh, what do I do here?' and I just thought, 'just win'. That's the worst thing you can do \u2013 think. You slow down, because you're thinking about what to do next and that takes time. Rather than be instinctive and just doing what you trained to do all winter.\" In his new incarnation as team player, Chambers praised Ennis' victory for inspiring his own, having watched her medal ceremony from the warm-up area. There, on the podium, Ennis had risen to her tiptoes for the winners' photograph, her tiny 5ft 4in frame dwarfed by the two giants alongside her, silver and bronze medallists Nataliya Dobrynska and Tatyana Chernova. Ennis's second pentathlon world title in seven months showed why she has become known as an athlete who rises to the occasion. The first British woman to win both indoor and outdoor world titles dominated the competition from start to finish, her final score of 4,937 points just 54 points off Irina Belova's world record that has stood since 1992. Such a victory was all the more impressive after a troubled build up to the championships \u2013 a strained ligament in her right foot caused her to miss 10 days of training. In her two favourite events \u2013 60m hurdles and the high jump \u2013 she sailed into the lead, but there was some magic missing, a hurdles run of 8.04 and a wobbly clearance of 1.90m in the high jump both some way off her personal bests. Still, a day without magic for Ennis does not mean a day without medals \u2013 a good-to-average performance by Ennis' standards equates to a defeat for everybody else. Acknowledging the fact she could not help but smile. \"It's given me a lot of confidence,\" said Ennis, \"I missed a lot of training and felt quite anxious coming into this not preparing the way I wanted to. Having to deal with that and the worry that my foot might not hold up was always a bit of a stress at the back of my mind, so to do that and secure the gold medal was something really good.\" All the sweeter, then, that she twice recovered from falling behind in the shot put and the long jump. On each occasion she gathered her thoughts and returned with a new personal best \u2013 throwing 14.01m, and launching the biggest jump of her career, 6.44m. With just the 800m to go, the world record was within her reach. Ennis ran her heart out but ultimately ran out of steam. As she crossed the finish line in 2:12.55, she was as composed in the victory as in the execution. \"I can't believe it. It's so nice. It's hard because having a good year last year and everyone expecting you to win this year \u2013 I'm just glad that I've delivered and brought home a gold again.\" Her win will encourage enormous expectations for 2012, but Jessica Ennis is unlikely to be overwhelmed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
