Join Will Unwin for Jamaica v Italy, and our full report from Rennes will be online shortly. Byeeee! Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s not happy: Here\u2019s today\u2019s Fiver, on Argentina\u2019s remarkable journey to the World Cup: Here\u2019s Shelley Kerr: \u201cIt feels like deja vu. We made some errors, I thought our game plan worked well, but when you make mistakes you get punished.\u201d \u201cI thought tactically we got things right, a little adjustment here and there might have helped. Japan\u2019s movement was incredible, [but] two goals in our first World Cup, we\u2019ll take that.\u201d \u201cWe go into our last game needing to win. We thought that might be the case, but we\u2019ve come close to getting something.\u201d We\u2019ll be hearing from Shelley Kerr shortly. Japan were the better side over the 90 minutes, but that late handball looked absolutely nailed on. Shimizu moved her arm into the path of the ball as Cuthbert tried to control it. I can\u2019t see the difference between that and the penalty Scotland conceded early against England. \u201cAustralia v Brazil had a number of VAR checks on screen,\u201d says Andrew in Brazil. \u201cNothing today. At least two, maybe three, penalties should have been checked based on previous games.\u201d As I understand it, VAR checks everything. It\u2019s only when they spot a problem that they ask the referee to review the footage. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t at least flag up that late Japan handball. It\u2019s all over. Scotland look devastated, with Rachel Corsie in tears after another narrow defeat. 91 mins: So nearly a third for Japan, as Kobayashi squares for Sugita \u2013 but Alexander tips the midfielder\u2019s looping shot away! 90 mins: Only two minutes of stoppage time, and perhaps a case of close, but no cigar for Scotland once again. 89 mins: Ichise, who has been really solid until now, plays a dreadful pass and Scotland take advantage. Clelland still has plenty to do 20 yards out, but fires a shot into the top corner from 18 yards. Nothing the keeper could do about that. Game on? A defensive error is punished by Lana Clelland, who produces a magnificent finish! 87 mins: Fiona Brown has come on for Lisa Evans. She turns a cross towards Emslie, but it\u2019s overhit. 85 mins: I\u2019ve no idea why that wasn\u2019t a penalty, given some that have been given in this tournament. 84 mins: Another Scottish penalty appeal, as Cuthbert\u2019s attempted flick-through appeared to hit a Japanese hand. No penalty, and no intervention from VAR. Which is off, as the replays show the ball rolling down Shimizu\u2019s arm. 83 mins: Cuthbert finds Evans, who has a pop from distance. It may have been flying wide but Yamashita doesn\u2019t take any chances, diving to her right to tip it away. 80 mins: That was Scotland\u2019s best attacking spell of the match, with Chelsea\u2019s Cuthbert at the heart of it. Japan make another change, with Iwabuchi replaced by Yui Hasegawa. 79 mins: The ball is played in to Cuthbert, who goes down under a challenge. The referee waves it away, and Scottish fans greet that decision with jeers. In truth, there wasn\u2019t much in it. 78 mins: Scotland hit the post! The free kick is lofted towards the far post and lands at the feet of Erin Cuthbert, whose shot from an acute angle cannons off the near post! 77 mins: Clelland, who plays her club football in Florence (nice work if you can get it), immediately wins a free kick, 10 yards infield from the corner flag... 76 mins: Scotland finding one or two gaps all of a sudden \u2013 Cuthbert sets herself for a shot from a narrow angle which Ichise closes down smartly. Lana Clelland comes on for Jane Ross. 75 mins: Emslie works hard to win another corner, which she angles in towards Beattie. The centre-back gets a head to it, but can only send it wide under pressure. 73 mins: A tired pass from Jen Beattie allows Kobayashi to get on the ball, but Iwabuchi\u2019s cutback towards Sugasawa, lurking on the edge of the area, is overhit. 71 mins: Lauder\u2019s diagonal ball looks to have set Ross away down the left wing \u2013 but the forward is a fraction offside. 70 mins: Another tidy passing move earns Japan a corner, which Nakajima whips in. Scotland clear but as Emslie tries to break, three blue shirts close her down at speed. 68 mins: Eek, Kobayashi almost scores with her first touch! The ball is prodded into the penalty area and the forward is just beaten to the ball by Alexander \u2013 who stays alert to save Sameshima\u2019s opportunistic shot moments later. 66 mins: The goalkeeper punches awkwardly away and the ball lands at Lisa Evans\u2019 feet \u2013 but under pressure, she can\u2019t keep her shot down. Change for Japan: Rikako Kobayashi replaces Endo. 65 mins: Cuthbert keeps a cool head up against two defenders, winning a corner and a chance to test Yamashita in the air... 63 mins: Alexander collects a cross and launches a long throw towards Emslie. Scotland are three on three momentarily, but dally on the ball, and Kumagai gets back to head the cross away. From the throw-in, an overhit cross has Yamashita scurrying out of her area to clear. 62 mins: Japan ping passes around, constantly changing their shape to probe for weak points in the Scottish defence. If Marcelo Bielsa is watching, he must be nodding approvingly from atop his big blue bucket. 60 mins: Arnot comes off, replaced by Claire Emslie, who got Scotland back in the game against England on Sunday. 58 mins: Japan break away at speed, and Nakajima is in acres of space down the right. She cuts inside her marker and curls a shot towards the far corner that Alexander palms away! 57 mins: Scotland almost crack the Japanese defence, with Cuthbert drifting centrally and playing in Evans \u2013 but Ichise gets back and makes a fine interception! 56 mins: Argentina getting a point and clean sheet against Japan looks more impressive with every passing minute. 55 mins: Sugita\u2019s shot is blocked but Japan regroup, and Sugasawa is this close to sweeping a shot on goal from 15 yards out. Beattie gets a vital touch, and from the corner, Kumagai can\u2019t direct her volley on target. 53 mins: A lull, with a couple of tentative attacks from Japan ended by fouls. Scotland steadier than the end of the first half, but still struggling to get forward. 50 mins: Scotland work the ball from left to right, Evans holding it up well before finding Caroline Weir. The Manchester City midfielder evades a challenge and shoots from 20 yards \u2013 but Yamashita is right behind it. 49 mins: As much as Scotland might want to go hell for leather, they don\u2019t want to get thumped. There\u2019s still a chance to get a win against Argentina \u2013 and goal difference might be key to sneaking into the last 16 if they do. 47 mins: Jane Ross tries to chase down a long ball forward, but Yamashita is off her line to punt it away. The second half has kicked off. No changes for either side. Don\u2019t forget, you can follow the latest Golden Boot standings, updated after every match, on our site. Agree, but there\u2019s still time \u2013 and Scotland showed against England they can cause problems when they\u2019re forced to push forward. ICMYT, here are match reports from Thursday\u2019s two games, as Australia and China grabbed vital victories: \u201cThe verdict is still out on Shelley Kerr as a tactician,\u201d says Hope Solo on the BBC. She adds that Jen Beattie should have blocked Iwabuchi\u2019s opener, and Corsie \u201cshould know better\u201d than to put an arm on Sugasawa. Forthright as always. That didn\u2019t go to plan for Scotland, but Japan have been excellent and could have been further ahead. 45 mins: Japan hit the bar! They race forward one last time and Endo cuts the ball back from the byline to Sugita, who turns her shot onto the crossbar! Could have been three, and Scotland are relieved to hear the whistle. 44 mins: Scotland continue to press, before an offside flag drains their momentum. One added minute. 42 mins: Oof! Scotland make a foray downfield and Erin Cuthbert fizzes a shot just over the bar. That\u2019s a bit better. 40 mins: \u201cScotland jobbed two games in a row,\u201d fumes Gerald Steele. \u201cVery, very dubious penalty v England and now an atrocious offside call, and immediately Japan go right up the field and score.\u201d This was sent before that penalty. I imagine Gerald will be pure ragin\u2019 just now. Corsie was also booked for impeding Sugasawa. That looked pretty soft in real time \u2013 but Corsie did put an arm on her opponent\u2019s shoulder, almost inviting her to take a tumble. It\u2019s Sugasawa who takes it \u2013 and sends Alexander the wrong way to double Japan\u2019s lead. 35 mins: Corsie and Sugasawa tangle underneath a high ball... and the referee awards a penalty to Japan! \u201cThat\u2019s [see 21 mins] got to be the worst offside decision in a World Cup finals since Nicola Berti was flagged despite being half a mile on during Italia \u201890,\u201d says Simon McMahon. 32 mins: From the corner, Iwabuchi fires into the side netting. Scotland are hanging on here... 31 mins: ...Alexander fails to deal with a cross and centre-back Kumagai steers a header towards an open goal \u2013 but Kim Little is there to head off the line! 30 mins: Miura feints to shoot, then lets Nakajima whip in a cross that\u2019s headed away by Corsie. Japan come again... 29 mins: Corsie ends a Japanese break with a foul on Sugasawa, some 25 yards out. A chance for Japan to put a cross into the danger area... 28 mins: Japan pour forward and Iwabuchi collects her own deflected flick-on, shooting from six yards. Beattie does well to block, with all eyes on the referee as the ball ricochets close to the defender\u2019s arm. No call from the VAR, and Scotland breathe again. 26 mins: Ominous stat for Scotland \u2013 Japan have won their last 10 World Cup games when they\u2019ve taken the lead. 25 mins: A deserved lead for Japan, but a blow to Scotland\u2019s confidence. They\u2019ve been cagey so far, and will be disappointed to have let a team struggling for goals onto the scoresheet so early. 23 mins: Endo picks up the ball from a clearance, and with too many pink shirts heading her way, she cuts back to Iwabuchi, in space on the edge of the area. The striker takes a touch, then fires a terrific shot that beats Alexander for power! And just like that, Japan take the lead! 21 mins: Weir and Arnot combine down the left before the latter plays a through ball to Evans. The flag goes up, late, but replays show the winger was a yard on. 19 mins: After a mesmerising Japanese passing move, Rachel Corsie gets to the ball ahead of Sameshima \u2013 who floors the Scotland captain with a crunching challenge! It was late, and the left-back gets a booking. 17 mins: Smith gets caught in possession down by the corner flag and Iwabuchi hares infield along the byline. With options in the middle, she goes for goal \u2013 and Alexander collects comfortably. 15 mins: Scotland enjoy a spell of possession in their own half, before an optimistic long ball is dealt with by Kumagai. 13 mins: Emi Nakajima has looked Japan\u2019s biggest attacking threat thus far, and Scotland\u2019s defence have to be on their guard to stop her slaloming in on goal from the left of the area. 11 mins: Jane Ross gets onto a pass from Lauder, and with options limited, holds the ball up nicely until the left-back gets up to support her. From Ross\u2019s cut-back, Lauder fires a shot on target \u2013 but it lacks the power to test Yamashita in the Japan goal. 9 mins: Sugasawa is penalised for handball as she tries to control a pass in the centre circle. 7 mins: Kirsty Smith\u2019s long pass towards Lisa Evans is cut out and Japan counter. Iwabuchi steers the ball across goal and Nakajima connects sweetly, sending a volley just wide of the near post! 6 mins: Kerr is out on the edge of the technical area, watching on intently. Did you know \u2013 the Scotland manager spent 17 years working for a Japanese company? In Livingston, admittedly \u2013 but still. 5 mins: Japan stroke the ball around their midfield. They can do that all day long, and Scotland may need to be patient. 3 mins: Manchester United\u2019s Lizzie Arnot brings down a long ball, but her cross is cleared away. Moments later, Ross finds herself in space but her first touch lets her down. 2 mins: Gianni Infantino is in the crowd, perhaps hoping to pick up some corner-taking tips. 1 min: Nakajima whips in an early cross but Iwabuchi can\u2019t quite connect, and Lee Alexander collects. Japan are in their traditional dark blue, with Scotland in their bright pink away strip. England, Scotland, Argentina and Japan \u2013 this group\u2019s got a very Rugby World Cup vibe, hasn\u2019t it? Anyway, time for the anthems. Japan\u2019s is a subtle, sombre affair while \u2018Flower of Scotland\u2019 comes complete with the obligatory drums and pipes. There\u2019s an estimated 5,000 Scotland fans in the house today. Scotland are one of four World Cup debutants in France, alongside Jamaica, Chile and South Africa. None have picked up a point yet, but they\u2019ve shown they deserve a place \u2013 more on that, and further talking points, here: Shelley Kerr on picking Jane Ross: \u201cJane\u2019s a top goalscorer. We need that threat today, you can\u2019t sit behind the ball for 90 minutes. She provides an attacking threat, and we hope she can link up well with Erin Cuthbert.\u201d Here\u2019s an intriguing deep dive into the unusual history of women\u2019s football in Japan. As this quote shows, it was quite a journey to become world champions in 2011: \u201cIn the early 1980s, women\u2019s tournaments even had different rules. The pitch was smaller; they played with a special \u201cgirls\u2019 ball\u201d; the halves were only 25 minutes long; and hands were permitted if they were used to protect chests.\u201d Shelley Kerr has rung the changes, with full-backs Sophie Howard and Nicola Docherty replaced by Kirsty Smith and Hayley Lauder, who wins her 100th cap. Jane Ross and Lizzie Arnot also come in, with the injured Christie Murray and Claire Emslie, the goalscorer against England, missing out. Japan coach Asako Takakura calls on experience in attack, with Mana Iwabuchi replacing Kumi Yokoyama. Nana Ichise and Jun Endo also come in, replacing Moeka Minami and Yui Hagesawa. Get to know both teams a little better with our expert guides: Japan (4-4-2): Yamashita; Shimizu, Kumagai, Ichise, Sameshima; Nakajima, Miura, Sugita, Endo; Sugasawa, Iwabuchi. Subs: Ikeda, Utsugi, Sakaguchi, Kobayashi, Minami, Takarada, Hasegawa, Momiki, Miyagawa, Yokoyama, Hirao, Miyake. Scotland (4-4-2): Alexander; Smith, Corsie, Beattie, Lauder; Evans, Little, Weir, Arnot; Cuthbert, Ross. Subs: Docherty, Love, Crichton, Lynn, Arthur, Howard, Murray, Emslie, Clelland, Brown, Fife. Scotland\u2019s senior sides, as if you needed reminding, have never reached the knockout stages at a major tournament. The men have tried and failed 10 times, while the women\u2019s team came up agonisingly short at Euro 2017. Shelley Kerr\u2019s side may have lost their opening game here, but there are reasons to believe. They gave England a late scare in Nice, and face a Japan side who haven\u2019t won in five matches and were held to a surprise 0-0 draw by Argentina. That said, Japan have been to the last two finals, and will be eager to show they are still contenders today. A point for Scotland here would set up a final showdown with Argentina, with a likely place in the last 16 for the winners. History informs us that with Scotland, things are rarely that straightforward. Kick-off is at 2pm, BST; 3pm in Rennes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
