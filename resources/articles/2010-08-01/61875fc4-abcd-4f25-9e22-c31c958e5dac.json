If this turns out to be true, can't you just see those headlines: \"Waity Katie waits no more!\"; \"For Waity Katie the wait is over!' Not quite: \"Gold-digging upstart finally reels him in, and she's not even preggers\", but you get the gist. It will be all about Kate Middleton snagging her prince. Well, eventually. Patience is indeed a virtue, with a diamond sparkler on top. To which one might say: \"Oh stop putting up with it, Kate, and if you ever get the chance, jilt the arrogant blighter.\" I don't particularly care for Kate Middleton. Like so many in the royal swirl, she's always appeared safe, dull, a cookie-cutter, far too careful not to frighten the corgis. That said, there's been something undeniably nasty about Middleton's treatment that says a lot about supposedly modern classless Britain. As we all know, William's mother received endless adulation and sympathy \u2013 some deserved, some not, considering she could be a self-absorbed, mendacious piece of work. By contrast, William's squeeze at best, a royal doormat, at worst, idle, work-shy, on the make. Read some of Middleton's press and you could be forgiven for presuming that our heir to the throne was dithering over marrying into the cast of Shameless. Is it her fault she's in this position? Yes, but it is also William's. In the light of his position, he's rude and cruel to keep his woman waiting, thus subjecting her to public scrutiny and ridicule. However, in real terms, the Waity jibe is unfair. They met at university \u2013 did people seriously think they should get married at 21, 22 or even 25? But then, it's not just about the wait with Kate. As with so much in British life, even today, this is about class. Her mother used to be an air hostess and now runs a party goods firm. Hence, comes the background hiss, the Middletons must be a bunch of commoner upstarts. Ergo, Kate should be made to wait or even fail completely. The middle-class girl from Berkshire must atone for her social-climbing sins. This attitude also abounds in the ordinary world. When it comes to whom they choose to love, it's as if women have to stay within precise, class-based cum financial boundaries or they'll be instantly lumbered with the gold-digger tag. With the royals, this attitude is deafening, but why? These days, it's a farce if Waity Katie, or anyone, should be made to feel \"not good enough\" for one of the most dysfunctional families in Britain. Indeed, what kind of marital hell awaits Middleton chez Windsor? Prince Philip looming up over the cornflakes with \"amusing\" remarks about foreigners? Prince Charles in his cups endlessly quoting The Goons and playing his Three Degrees casettes? With this in mind, who could blame Middleton if she's secretly enamoured by the tiaras and the lifestyle? Quite apart from anything else, William has turned out to be pretty dull. Not much of interest is ever likely to pop out of that rather petulant royal mouth. Any bride of his would be wise to optimise the perks. Of course, this could all be rubbish and there could be no wedding. If there isn't, one imagines it will be because, like many university relationships, it has petered out. Also, perhaps, because vicious, ingrained snobbery still runs through the UK. If there is a big day, the best-case scenario would be for Kate to make it even bigger by jilting William at the altar and running away, out of the royal hell forever, screaming as she goes, loud and proud: \"I'm a commoner, get me out of here!\" Oh, G\u00e9rard, you must stop letting your envy show It seems unfair to criticise G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2013 he already has to go about the world with a face like a sucked Dorito. However, ranting about fellow French thespian Juliette Binoche, Depardieu said: \"I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing. Absolutely nothing.\" To this, he added charmingly: \"She's nobody. She's nothing.\" They don't get on, then? In fairness, Depardieu did praise actresses Isabelle Adjani and Fanny Ardant. Still, what could possibly have inspired this ungallant attack on Binoche, a sweet and, most would say, talented actress? Some whisper of Oscar-envy (Binoche 1, Depardieu 0). Moreover, Binoche has a sense of quality-control, while Depardieu has been \u2013 how to put this politely? \u2013 \"more prolific\". He says himself: \"I've made 200 films, of which 150 were [insert rude Gallic word].\" So self-awareness isn't a problem for G\u00e9rard, just that thing of randomly laying into actresses. Mean-spirited cochon (look it up). The French film industry could do worse than to keep Depardieu even busier \u2013 he may have a bit too much time on those strange giant hands. Recession denial \u2013 what a luxury Are some of us suffering from recession-blindness? It's a condition similar to snow-blindness, but caused by staring at gloomy financial forecasts for so long that some people become blinded to reality. A Mintel report says that many of us are refusing to give up \"little luxuries\"; these range from hairdressers and beauty salons (\u00a35.34bn), new clothes (\u00a328.2bn), luxury bath items (\u00a3580m) to eating out and takeaways (\u00a31.8bn). This could be framed in two ways. Optimistically: how wonderful to see the Blitz spirit alive and well, manifesting itself in a refusal to give up Molton Brown Energising Seamoss bath bubbles in hard times. Less happily: \"Is that the takeaway delivery at the door? Hello, Mr Bailiff. I was just enjoying an Energising Seamoss bubble bath. I say, is it absolutely necessary to take the plasma television?\" In the report, we are told that luxuries feel essential, because, so far, less than half of the population feels worse off because of the recession, though many are very anxious about the year to come. Hmm. This indicates that many of us are merrily overspending and frittering, while saying: \"Next year looks really bad.\" Come next year, what's the betting we'll be saying exactly the same thing? This isn't recession-blindness at all \u2013 a large swath of the nation appears to be engulfed in a state of outright recession-denial. Sorry, but regardless of whether or not one is \"feeling it\", the recession is here. One can't hope to delay it to a vague \"next year\", in the manner of an electronic food tray that feeds the cat while you're away. You'd have to be an idiot to do that. Or British. It's sweet to know that in times of hardship, the biggest consumer success story is rose-tinted spectacles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
