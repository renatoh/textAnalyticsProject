On 7, Konjuh won the first set against Barty, but trails 0-4 in the second; not much else going on, truth be telt. Two dangerous floaters in the women\u2019s draw: Lucic-Baroni and Puig, who are playing on 11. Lucic-Baroni is a set and a break up. Soon to start: the absolute jazzer that is Halep-Sharapova. You can follow that here: Muller has beaten Tomic, 6-4 in the fourth, and will play Lorenzi next. His serve and composure means he\u2019ll be a tricky night for anyone. Muller and Tomic are still on serve in their fourth set; Tipsarevic is 4-1 ahead of Kokkinakis in their third, but lost the first two. And Querrey has broken at the start of set three. He\u2019s looking good for round 2. On Grandstand, Querrey leads Simon by two sets to love, 4 and 3. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beautiful 20 years,\u201d says Venus of her time playing at Flushing Meadow. \u201cI love this game.\u201d Wait, she\u2019s a Patrice Evra fan? Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t love her any more. Venus has handled this deciding set with perfect authority, and at 5-2, raises her first match point; she cracks a backhand return into the net. but anothrr quickly arrives, and seconds later she\u2019s twirling at the net. Venus Williams beats Viktoria Kuzmova 6-3 3-6 6-2. She\u2019ll play Parmentier or Dobin next. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Johanna Konta\u2019s defeat. Luxembourg\u2019s finest, Gilles Muller, now leads Tomic by two sets to one; by rights, Tomic should toss it off in the fourth, but let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t. Pouille has clinched that first set against Bemelmans, Ramos-Vinolas is now 2-1 ahead of Istomin, while Querrey and Simon are on serve in the third. Venus obviously held serve, by the way, then Kuzmova got on the board and Venus held again. She\u2019s 4-1 ahead in the final set, and very nearly home Stephens has sorted Vinci 5 and 1 and will play Cibulkova or Cepelova next. Well lookee here! Williams breaks Kuzmova immediately for 2-0, but Kuzmova then arranges three break-back points forthwith. Venus, being awesome, saves them all. Also: Mischa Zverev trails Thai-Son Kwiatkowski by two sets to one; Thanis Kokkinakis is a set up on but a break down to Janko Tipsarevic. Around the courts: Querrey leads Simon by a set to love, but is a break down in the second; Sloane Stephens will shortly be finished with Roberta Vinci; Tomic and Muller are 1-1, 4-4; and Pouille, the number 16 seed, is a break up on Bemelmans. More Konta: she\u2019s happy with how she competed, and is, er, taking the positives. She reckons Krunic handled the pressure better than she did. Kuzmova is loving this, a booming serve setting her for set point at 5-3 40-30. And a serve out wide, then a cleanup forehand crosscourt, and she and Venus are now at one set all! Johanna Konta is disappointed. More news as I get it. Hello, hello, said it\u2019s good to be back, good to be back. I don\u2019t feel as if I know you/You take up all my time/The days are long and the nights will throw you away/Cause the sun don\u2019t shine. Gosh, I\u2019m not sure what came over me there. Handing back to Daniel Harris now, who will see you through the rest of the afternoon\u2019s action... This is Kuzmova\u2019s first senior grand slam appearance \u2013 she\u2019s only 19, and ranked 135th in the world. The Slovakian has just broken back, much to Venus\u2019s chagrin. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on one bit of good news for British players today, as Kyle Edmund cruised into the second round: Kuzmova can only chuckle to herself as her aggressive efforts are met with dazzling defence from Venus, who is now a break up in the second. Here\u2019s a stat for you \u2013 David Ferrer has gone out in the first round, losing in four sets to Mikhail Kukushkin. The last time Ferrer lost in the first round of a slam was at Wimbledon, in 2005. Venus Williams, an entirely reasonable shout to go all the way in the women\u2019s draw, has taken the first set 6-3. Home hopes are in action on the other show courts, with Sloane Stephens against 2015 finalist Roberta Vinci and Sam Querrey taking on Gilles Simon. Both matches are in the first set. As Kevin Mitchell explains here, Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal have stayed on the same side of the draw despite Andy Murray\u2019s late withdrawal: That also leaves the bottom half of the draw wide open \u2013 No5 seed and 2014 winner Marin Cilic might be the marginal favourite over Alexander Zverev. The German is seeded fourth but has only got to the second week of a slam once (at this year\u2019s Wimbledon), never mind a final. Elsewhere, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has won in straight sets, beating Marius Copil to begin his quarterly run to the last 16. Venus Williams has made a blistering start against Viktoria Kuzmova \u2013 she\u2019s 4-1 up in the first set \u2013 and tennis-hating Bernard Tomic has taken the first set against Gilles M\u00fcller, but is behind in the second. Well then. Fair play to Krunic, who fought back from a set down with the required smarts and skill, and could make a decent run in an open draw. Konta will be devastated, though. Too many fundamentals, not least her serve, went missing as the pressure ratcheted up. Krunic takes her second match point as Konta fires a forehand way wide. The British No1 is out in the first round! Krunic has only been past the first round at a slam twice before. How are the world No78\u2019s nerves? Pretty good \u2013 an ace, then a brilliant recovery from a drop-shot, and she\u2019s 30-0. A brief rally is ended with a punchy winner to the corner. Three match points... Konta misses a routine backhand to fall 0-30 down. Her game has unravelled in this set, and she\u2019s two points from going out. An ace makes it 15-30 \u2013 then a second serve clips the line! Another ace, and a crashing backhand down the line, and Konta is out of jail for now \u2013 but Krunic will serve for the match... Thanks Daniel, hello everyone. Johanna Konta is in a significant spot of bother against Aleksandra Krunic, who has won three games in a row and leads 5-3 in the third. The No7 seed is serving to stay in the match... Right, I\u2019m off for a little recess; Niall McVeigh will chat you through the next little passage. Decent match in the mix on Court 8; the always-entertaining Gulbis leads Giannessi 6-4 6-7 6-2 1-1. Marin Cilic has excellent beard coverage, and excellent continuation from the sideboards. More news as I get it. Konta takes another longarse game, and I wonder if Krunic has run her race now. She trails 2-3 in the decider. Here and there: Istomin is a set up on Ramos Vinolas, who is a break up in the second; in what might be the match of the day - in our dreams - Muller and Tomic are 3-3. Konta is now a break down in the decider, and from deuce Krunic has a game point. But Konta saves it, then punishes a tired, nervous drop and we\u2019re back on serve. Cilic sorts it out! He won\u2019t have been expecting that level of aggravation but he\u2019s through, and so is John Isner, who has disposed of Pierre Herbert 6-4 in the fourth. Cilic will play Mayer or Dutra Silva next, while Isner meets Chung. I think he might find that tricky. Sandgren saves yet another break point, this time with a monstrous backhand down the line. But Cilic arranges another, tries a drop, and Sandgren has a chance for a winner! But he\u2019s wide, just, and after 10 minutes 11 seconds, Cilic wins the game and will serve for the match! Sandgren is playing his arse of here. Serving 3-4 behind in the fourth, he and Cilic are going backwards and forwards on deuce and advantage. Well! Krunic takes the second set 6-3! Her and Konta shall now begin a decider, with the number 7 seed showing no signs of improvement. On Ashe, we\u2019re still on serve in the fourth; Cilic leads Sandgren 4-3 (and by two sets to one). On Armstrong, Isner is back at it, 4-1 to the good against Herbert; he\u2019s nearly there. Oh, this is interesting. Eventually, Konta holds. Prepare for lots of \u201cIt\u2019s the first round, it\u2019s just about getting through\u201d PMA stuff when she eventually wins. Krunic racks up two break points which Konta saves, and then saves another with as lovely pick-up at the net, far from her forte. Elsewhere, Tsonga is two sets to love up on Copil, and Herbert has cinched that third set against Isner. Krunic is playing very well now, and Konta isn\u2019t hitting the ball at all well. A love hold has the latter up 3-2, while on Ashe, Sandgren and Cilic are 1-1 in the third. On Armstrong, Herbert is serving to close the gap on Isner to 2-1. Kukushkin now leads Ferrer by 2-1, plus a break. Alas the hyperactive scurrying is no longer enough. Brilliant from Sandgren! He takes the third set 6-3, and Cilic, who looked nearly home, has serious work to do! Sandgren is serving for the set against Cilic! He\u2019s really playing very well now, but finds himself at deuce once more. Cilic then gets himself advantage and for a second looks to have exploited the situation, hitting the net-cord. But the ball doesn\u2019t die, Sandgren smacks it deep, and Cilic sends a lob long. Konta takes the first set against Krunic, 6-4; Krunic will rue that, after working so hard to get back into things. Chung has come from a set and a mini-break down to beat Zeballos. He\u2019ll play the winner of Herbert and Isner - so Isner - in the next round. On Armstrong, Isner has taken the second set against Herbert. He leads 6-1 6-3. But Krunic then gifts her next service game, even applying the ribbon of a double-fault on break point. They\u2019ll have a little sitdown, and then Konta will serve for the first set. Krunic has broken back against Konta, who\u2019s making backhand errors - unusual for her. They\u2019re now at 4-4. Tsonga is now a break up in the second set against Copil, while Ferrer looks to be settling himself in for his usual epic; he\u2019s 1-1 with Kukushkin, and a break down in the third. Sandgren, meanwhile, has consolidated once more and is winning points on first and second third, with Cilic looking wobbly. Sandgren has broken Cilic, who leads him by two sets to love. He\u2019s then made to fight like billy-o to hang onto the advantage, but eventually he gets there for 3-0; please do enjoy the very state of him. Great news pals! Kevin Anderson is into round 2, after trouncing JC Aragone - Aragone more like - 3,3 and 1. He\u2019ll play Gulbis or Giannessi next. In other art news, Isner leads Herbert 6-1 2-1, with a break in that second set. On Court 8, Konta has broken Krunic thanks to her hypnotic ball-bouncing; she leads 2-1 in the first. On Court 13, Chung has broken Zeballos, and need only hold serve four times to progress. Might this be the Slam at which he becomes a contender? Tsonga raced through his first set in 31 minutes, 6-3 against Copil. I guess we\u2019ve seen the best of him now, but every Slam is better for his presence. Shonuff, Cilic sorts that second set to 3. I\u2019m beginning to think that he might sneak through here. On Ashe, Cilic is pounding down the serves and also venturing to the net now; he leads 6-4 5-3 30-0... On telly, they\u2019re saying that Jo Konta is a serious contender to win here. Granted, I\u2019m in England, and granted, those saying it know more of these things than me, but I just can\u2019t see it. Good though she is, it seems to me that one of the more naturally talented payers will play well enough in the second week to beat her. Chung now leads Zeballos 2-1; that long breaker he sneaked, after trailing most of the way through it, looks like it was the turning point. Chung is a serious talent, and well on his way to becoming a serious player. Jo Konta is just out. She\u2019ll be taking each game as it comes, we learnt in a revealing pre-match interview. Her opponent, Alexandra Krunic, reached round 4 in 2014. Or, put another way, this might not take very long. On the off-chance it\u2019s of interest, here\u2019s a piece on how Konta does it. \u201cOh great!\u201d cheers aesthetes the world over. \u201cJohn Isner is on court!\u201d He\u2019s playing Pierre Herbert, and leads 2-1. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is also underway, playing Marius Copil. Stevie - yes, he really does go by that - pulled through and is through. He plays Kyle Edmund next. Stevie Johnson, 2-0-up on Almagro, is vex. He\u2019s disturbed at 1-1 in the third set breaker, and loses the point anyway. Elsewhere, Sandgren broke Cilic back, then lost his serve again; that was enough to account for the set, 6-4 to the number 5 seed. Chung is a break up on Zeballos in the third set; they\u2019re at 1-1 overall. Cameron Norrie will play Pablo Carreno Busta in round 2; Carreno Busta has done Evan King, 3, 2 and 6. Kevin Anderson, the purists\u2019 favourite, has taken the first set against JC Aragone, 6-3; the purists\u2019 other favourite, David Ferrer, is also a set to the good, against Mikhail Kukushkin. On Ashe, Cilic has raced to 4-1 against Sandgren. I\u2019m choking up, here. Can anyone think of anything else notable that happened in Joburg in 1995? Chung has won that breaker against Zeballos to eight, levelling the match. You\u2019d back him - er, I did - to ease clear from here. That\u2019s a serious kicking and a serious performance, is that, and no one will fancy playing him. Either Johnson or Almagro will have to; the former leads by two sets and 4-3. Edmund now leads Haase 2-0 and 5-3 with a break, showing no sign of letting up. His forehand is truly something to behold, behind Delpoz and Nadal but quite possibly the best of the rest. On Court 13, Chung has come from behind to level his second-set breaker with Zeballos at 7-7; Zeballos won the first sey. On Ashe, Cilic and Sandgren are underway; Cilic is 1-0-up, on serve. He was 7-6 6-1 ahead, and plays King or, more likely, Carreno Busta next. I don\u2019t know; does Watson have any improvement left in her? I hope so. Cornet faces Kvitova, as I mentioned a second ago. She had to work really hard for that, especially in the second set, but she got it did and meets Watson or Cornet next. Watson has been broken and broken back; her and Cornet are at 4-4 in the second set. Edmund has broken Haase in the first game of the third set; Johnson leads Almagro by two sets to love, and after them we\u2019ll get some Konta; oh, ad Cameron Norrie of the United Kingdom leads Dmitry Tursanov by a set! Haase fell apart there. He needs to issue himself with some stern words. We\u2019ve just been shown Muguruza\u2019s winning point, and she is so serious nowadays, at the same time as being equally fun to watch. At Wimbledon, when they did the toss she stood close to the net and hit air shots, highlighting her physical superiority to her opponent; she may as well have asked \u201cWHAT YOU LOOKING AT?\u201d I did not see that coming and nor did Kyle Edmund; Haase has broken back and serves at 5-5. Muguruza is couchward bound; she\u2019s thrumped Lepchenko 6-0, 6-3 and plays Liu or Duan next. Haase holds easily; Edmund will serve for it. \u201c\u2018Interregnum example\u2019? chides Philip Reynolds re Lleyton Hewitt. \u201cA bit harsh: he was the number one seed for Wimbledon in 2002, when he was in the middle of 75 consecutive weeks as world no 1; that isn\u2019t luck.\u201d I agree it wasn\u2019t luck, but he did well to play when he did, just as Sampras was finishing and Federer was starting. Two years earlier or later and he\u2019d not have any Slams I don\u2019t think; he has one fewer than Andy Murray, for example. That doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t good, of course. Brilliant from Edmund who, 0-40 down, wins five points in a row for 5-3. I\u2019d not be shocked to see Haase lose his serve here... Sophia Kenin leads Lauren Davies, the number 32 seed, by a set to love in the USA USA USA derby. I take it back! Watson has broken back against Cornet and they\u2019re now level at 2-2 in the second set. After a row over a review, Edmund puts it behind him and breaks Haase anyroad up! He leads 4-3! Carreno Busta has sped to a second set against King. Everyone else everywhere else is lagging behind. Meanwhile Muguruza is nearly back on the couch; she leads Lepchenko 6-0, 4-2. Haase is not loving this now! Edmund swiftly gets to 15-40 and the shoulders slump! But he fights his way to deuce, then saves another break point with another ace. Cornet has broken Watson; in more ways than one, I\u2019d hazard. She\u2019s up 2-0 and 6-4. Great stuff from Edmund; two big serves later, it\u2019s 3-3. His confidence could start a house fire at the moment. Haase sorts himself a break point at 3-2; Edmund panels an ace past him. It was more of a struggle than looked likely at the start, but Kvitova took the first set off the veteran Jankovic, 7-5. As in the first set, Edmund and Haase are smacking forehands at one another; it\u2019s 2-2 in the second, Edmund by one set to love. It needed four set-points and 45 minutes, but Cornet leads Watson 6-4. \u201cAren\u2019t Federer and Nadal seeded to meet in the semi-finals, ruling out any chance of a final between them?\u201d asks David Wall. \u201cIf neither suffers fitness issues here you\u2019d think that the winner of that would be a good bet for the title, unless getting through that game exhausts them for the final. With all the absences it really opens up the other side of the draw in particular. But would that be a false dawn, like Michael Stich or Richard Krajicek winning Wimbledon back in the 90s, due more to lack of quality competition than emergence of someone likely to consistently dominate in the next few years?\u201d Ah, apologies. I assumed that with Andy Murray out, everyone would move up once, but having consulted with the draw, that seems not. Anyhow, not sure I quite agree on Stich and Krajicek. Stich beat Edberg and Becker to win his Wimbledon, and Karajicek beat Sampras. In those days, it was hard to handle a prime server who hit a zone at the right time. The best interregnum examples are Hewitt and Courier, I\u2019d say. Watson hangs in there, eventually cinching her service game to make Cornet serve for the set at 5-4. On Court 11, Carreno Busta is a set-up on King; Johnson is a set up on Almagro; and in what might be a shock brewing, Zeballos is a set-up on Chung. On Court 4, Watson is fighting to stay in the first set, serving a protracted game at 3-5. And he played really well to do it. On Armstrong, Jankovic broke back when Kvitova was serving for the set; she has two points for 5-5. Elsewhere, Muguruza has taken the first set against Lepchenko 6-0. Edmund\u2019s forehand is boomin\u2019 like right outta ya centrefold, and two great points get him 40-30. But Haase isn\u2019t going away, and a big forehand of his own earns deuce. As predicted, Edmund will now serve for the first set! Haase saves two break points, one with a monstrous ace down the middle, but then goes long with a forehand. And then Haase attempts a drop-shot, Edmund runs it down easily, forcing a half-court response, and punished a winner for three break points. But what\u2019s this? A lovely backhand slice forces Haase to do likewise, and he can\u2019t get underneath it properly; 0-30! Edmund is now 4-3 in front and looking strong on serve; I\u2019m expecting a breaker here. Kvitova is in amongst it on Armstrong, leading Jankovic 4-2. She\u2019s seeded 13, but I wonder if this might be the Slam at which she properly reasserts herself. Heather Watson fights through a hold and now trails Cornet 2-3, still a break down. On Ashe, the wonderful Muguruza is already 3-up on Lepchenko. I think this one might be over fairly quickly. Favourite Edmunds: Edmund Blackadder, Edmund Pevensie, Edmund Burke. Least favourite Edmunds: Edmund in King Lear, Edmund Bertram. Edmund claws his way back to 30-all thanks to a heavily sliced second serve, which forces a forehand error, then two booming serves seal the game. Excellent hold, 3-2 Edmund. As tends to happen in New York, we\u2019re on serve in our main match. Edmund and Haase are 2-2, but a creless forehand from the former - who is serving first - has him 0-30 down. On the show courts, we\u2019ve got Lepchenko-Muguruza, Kvitova-Jankovic and Almagro-Johnson. Johnson has broken Almagro immediately, but otherwise nowt untoward to report. Heather Watson is having a rotten time of things these days, and doesn\u2019t like it here - she\u2019s lost in round 1 six times in a row and never been beyond it. Aliz\u00e9 Cornet has broken her to 30 in the first game of their match on Court 4. Solid starts on serve for both Edmund and Haase, so we\u2019re at 1-1. Edmund got to round 4 last term, so is defending a fair few points here. He\u2019ll really not want to lose this. Now that\u2019s insight. On Court 10, Kyle Edmund and Robin Haase are about to get going; at 32, Haase is the last seed. It\u2019s a lovely day in Flushing, where there\u2019ll be a high of 76 degrees Fahrenheit - as a great man once nearly said, they\u2019ve not got the metric system over there. This afternoon, it\u2019s the women who comprise our central attractions. Though, as ever, be sure not to miss the unmissable Kevin Anderson and John Isner, both of whom the Almighty has sent for our delectation So who\u2019s gonna win dese ting? As far as the men go, we\u2019re presumably set for a Federer-Nadal final - I might just copy that sentence for use in 2047 - while, in the women\u2019s competition, the manner of Garbine Muguruza\u2019s Wimbledon win makes it hard to look beyond here. She knows she\u2019s the best, even if she isn\u2019t. There\u2019s something very special about the unbridled intensity of a tennis Slam, with its two weeks of nothing but. And here we are again, ready for another, and as usual, we\u2019ve got no idea what\u2019ll happen in the women\u2019s section, which is where most of our attention will be directed in this session. We\u2019ve got Garbine Muguruza, Venus Williams, Petra Kvitova, Sloane Stevens, Heather Watson and Johanna Konta, as well as Marin Cilic, Albert Ramos-Vinolas, Kyle Edmund and Bernard Tomic versus Gilles Muller! It\u2019s a lot! Start: 4pmBST"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
