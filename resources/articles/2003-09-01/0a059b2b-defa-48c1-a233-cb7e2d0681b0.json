An Israeli soldier was killed and four wounded in the operation, which targeted Mohammed Hanbali, leader of Hamas's military wing in the city. Palestinian gunmen opened fire as the Israeli commandos entered an apartment block where Hanbali was holed up, according Major Sharon Feingold, an Israeli army spokeswoman. The army fired several rockets at the building, from which residents had been evacuated, before arresting three of the militants. Believing other militants might be hiding on the top floors, troops then blew up the building, bringing down the tall structure that housed 28 families. Israel has intensified its hunt for militants since a mid-August Hamas suicide bombing on a Jerusalem bus. A 27-year-old Israeli man wounded in that attack died today, bringing the total killed to 23 people, including the bomber. Israel has said it will not let up until Palestinian security forces start dismantling Hamas, Islamic Jihad and armed groups with ties to Arafat's Fatah movement. The latest raid came a day after Mr Abbas told parliament it must either back him or strip him of his post. MPs will meet twice in coming days to decide whether to hold a confidence vote that could topple the unpopular Mr Abbas - who has been weakened by a power struggle with Yasser Arafat. Such a move would deliver a major blow to an already troubled US-backed peace plan. \"Israel is working to undermine [Abbas] and to undermine the road map,\" Palestinian cabinet minister Yasser Abed Rabbo told Reuters after the Nablus raid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
