Overdose \u2013 the unbeaten sprinter known as the Budapest Bullet \u2013 has been declared to run for the first time since April 2009 in a five-furlong event at Bratislava racecourse, in a possible rehearsal for the Nunthorpe Stakes at York next month. The jockey who will try to preserve his perfect racing record, meanwhile, has not ridden in Britain since 2005, but there will still be many punters who can recall backing winners with Gary Hind in the saddle. Hind, a former champion jockey in Dubai, was one of the many excellent apprentices to graduate from Reg Hollinshead's stable, and enjoyed regular success during the 1990s, including a Group One victory on Medaaly for Godolphin in the 1996 Racing Post Trophy. Now based in the Czech Republic, he rides regularly around central Europe, mostly at weekends, and has no regrets about removing himself from the seven-days-a-week conveyor belt of British Flat racing. \"I've got no regrets about my time in England and I certainly had more than one bite at the cherry,\" Hind said yesterday. \"I'd have ridden a winner at every track in the country for sure, I was up and down it so much. I was slightly a journeyman back in the UK, but when I catch the racing on Channel 4, I'll start reminiscing about things. The weekend just gone reminded me about winning the Magnet Cup [at York] for Godolphin back in 1994. I never rode that many winners in a season but it was a nice career. \"Looking back, I'd say the connection I had with John Gosden, much as it was great for me in many ways, slightly held me back in others. It was a difficult role, and a time when you had jockeys like George Duffield, Mark Birch and Lindsay Charnock riding on the northern circuit. It was rough and ready, not like now when you gets days [off] for coming off a straight line. We were sending odds-on shots up there that didn't really know the time of day, and when you're under instruction not to hit them, it's very difficult.\" Hind is 42, married with a five-year-old son, and rarely misses the days when he was on the road in Britain every day of the week. \"In 2003 I was champion jockey in Dubai, but it was starting to get a bit ugly [in the UK],\" Hind says. \"In the winter, I was getting full books every meeting in Dubai, but in Britain, I wasn't getting the rides I thought I should, and I found I didn't want to go four hours to Bath on Monday evening, or to Catterick for one ride when there's nice meetings elsewhere. \"I'd met my wife, and I've done plenty of travelling and I was lucky enough to know that there was another side of the coin. There was no point riding in Britain for the sake of it. It's great in Europe, the races are all staggered so every weekend you can be somewhere. I rode in the Austrian Derby three weeks ago, I've just ridden in the Polish Derby, and now the Slovakian Derby is coming up.\" Hind's partnership with Overdose will carry great expectations. He was booked by Zoltan Mikoczy, Overdose's owner, who still hopes that one day he will correct the greatest injustice of his career. Overdose came within a fraction of the course record when storming home in the Prix de l'Abbaye in 2008, but the race was declared void due to a false start and he was unable to contest the rerun later in the day. His feet have been a persistent problem, but after numerous false dawns, Overdose may finally be back. \"He's the one they all have to beat,\" Hind said. \"On freshness alone, he's surely going to want to jump and run, and the problem will be conserving his energy as much as anything. I'm hoping there will be no dramas, and if he's good enough, he wins.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
