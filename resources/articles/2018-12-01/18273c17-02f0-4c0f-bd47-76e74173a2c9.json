For Leicester 2016 in England, read Kilmarnock 2019 in Scotland? ...\u201d Burnley 1-3 Liverpool Everton 1-1 Newcastle Fulham 1-1 Leicester Manchester United 2-2 Arsenal Tottenham 3-1 Southampton Wolves 2-1 Chelsea The substitute Charlie Austin grabs a deserved consolation. Into stoppage-time at Old Trafford and Wembley. Tottenham, who have just introduced the highly-rated Oliver Skipp, still lead Southampton 3-0, while Arsenal are level-pegging 2-2 with Manchester United. And Saints have another golden chance, but Elyounoussi cannot convert. A bit of a spat between Klopp and Dyche at full-time at Turf Moor. It\u2019s more a few words than anything. Klopp did not appear to venture or crusade on to the pitch at the final whistle, at least. A quick take from our man at Molineux. \u201cTerrific win for Wolves against Chelsea,\u201d says Stuart James. \u201cPlayed with the dynamism, flair and belief that has been badly missing recently. Morgan Gibbs-White, aged 18, was outstanding on his full Premier League debut \u2013 some lovely touches and provided an assist. Diogo Jota off the mark too. Perfect night for Wolves.\u201d Burnley 1-3 Liverpool Everton 1-1 Newcastle Fulham 1-1 Leicester Wolves 2-1 Chelsea At Wembley, Southampton would have pulled a goal back, but for two brilliant saves by Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham captain. The Frenchman denies James Ward-Prowse from point-blank range after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg\u2019s powerful effort before he tips Charlie Austin\u2019s goal-bound effort around the post. Saints have summoned Mohamed Elyounoussi for the final nine minutes. Game over at Turf Moor. Phil Bardsley hacks another Liverpool effort off the line! After Joe Hart denies Ke\u00efta and Salah, and then Henderson, Ke\u00efta dispatches another effort goalwards but the Burnley defender somehow prevents Liverpool adding a third. Up at Old Trafford, two goals in 60 seconds. It\u2019s 2-2 with 20 minutes to play: A few changes around the grounds, with Lukaku and Lacazette on at Old Trafford, while Burnley have introduced Chris Wood and Aaron Lennon against Liverpool. Over at Molineux, Maurizio Sarri has summoned Olivier Giroud, Pedro and Mateo Kovacic in search of restoring parity. Elsewhere, Bernard and Theo Walcott are on against Newcastle at Goodison Park. Joe Bryan\u2019s on for Fulham. A quick, and slightly unnerving, stat courtesy of Opta: Fulham have conceded 36 goals in their 15 Premier League games in 2018-19; only Barnsley (40 in 1997-98) have ever conceded more at this stage of a campaign in the competition. The attendance at Wembley is 33,012. That\u2019s really low, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s a few thousand less than the capacity at White Hart Lane. And Tottenham may be three goals to the good, but Maya Yoshida has just missed a sitter for Saints with the defender somehow cocking-up James Ward-Prowse\u2019s free-kick. Shinji Okazaki, just on in place of Danny Simpson, does brilliantly raiding forward down the right before cutting the ball back for James Maddison. The midfielder sweeps home to score his second goal in as many matches. Game on! Roberto Firmino puts Liverpool ahead at Turf Moor, with the forward scoring with his first touch having replaced Divock Origi. Mo Salah is also on, with Alberto Moreno making way. Son Heung-min adds a third. It\u2019s turning into something of a rout at Wembley. A penny for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s thoughts. Lucas Moura hammers home his sixth goal of the season. Diogo Jota pokes Wolves in front at Molineux. Chelsea turn a little sloppy, Matt Doherty crosses and Jota side-foots in from close range. James Milner equalises at Turf Moor. That\u2019s the Liverpool midfielder\u2019s 50th Premier League goal. He has not lost a top-flight game in which he has scored, having scored 49 goals prior to his latest effort in Lancashire. Morgan Gibbs-White feeds Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, and the striker drills beyond Kepa. What a night for Manchester City. Meanwhile, we\u2019re back under way at Old Trafford and Wembley, where Saints trail Tottenham by a single goal. Jack Cork scores his first goal since April, beating Alisson from close range! When will Klopp feel the need to summon Salah and co? The cavalry are warming up. A stunning save by Joe Hart denies Naby Ke\u00efta! The midfielder shaped a wonderful effort from 25 yards, but the Burnley goalkeeper does brilliantly to prevent the \u00a352m man from opening his Liverpool account with his fingertips. Willy Boly brings down Alvaro Morata in the box at Molineux, but Wolves get away with it. It stemmed from good work by Eden Hazard, who found goalscorer Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who then played in the Spain striker. VAR, what is it good for? Well, scenarios like that, certainly. And then Morata fluffs his lines, heading over from inside the six-yard box under pressure from the defender Ryan Bennett. At Craven Cottage, summer loan signing Luciano Vietto has been replaced by Tom Cairney at the interval. As the half-time whistle sounds at Old Trafford (Man Utd 1-1 Arsenal) and Wembley (Tottenham 1-0 Southampton), we\u2019re back under way at Craven Cottage, Goodison, Turf Moor and Molineux. There aren\u2019t too many Spurs fans at Wembley tonight. Tottenham lead 1-0 thanks to Harry Kane, with one minute of added time to play in the first half. Three minutes stoppage-time at Old Trafford. Whether it\u2019s the absurdity of a 97th-minute Teemu Pukki winner, the way Marcelo Bielsa studiously refers to opposition players not by name but number, the six-point blanket that covers the top seven teams, or the pass-the-parcel manner in which six different sides have topped the table since August, the Championship\u2019s eclectic charm has been plain this season. Unpredictable and unforgiving, it is a land of bewitching drama, which prompts the question: is it the best league in the country? A serious-looking injury for Rob Holding at Old Trafford. The Arsenal defender leaves on a stretcher after a late challenge by Marcus Rashford. He\u2019s replaced by Lichtsteiner 36 minutes in. Down at Wembley, Southampton are holding their own, but are yet to truly frighten Tottenham going forward. Burnley 0-0 Liverpool Everton 1-1 Newcastle Fulham 1-0 Leicester Wolves 0-1 Chelsea And Jos\u00e9 Mourinho does not move an inch. Aboubakar Kamara powers home, hard and low, beyond Kasper Schmeichel to score his first league goal since January. Kamara, the man who wears the No47, nicknamed AK-47 in France before joining Fulham from Amiens last year. At Turf Moor, Ashley Barnes rifled a gorgeous volley into the net \u2013 but was ruled offside. A howler from David de Gea. \u201cThere\u2019s a full card in the Scottish Premiership tonight,\u201d emails Simon McMahon, \u201cand plenty of early goals too. Celtic lead 1-0 at Motherwell, Sunday\u2019s League Cup final hero Ryan Christie on target again, and beaten finalists Aberdeen have the same advantage at Stevie G\u2019s The Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers. St. Johnstone and Hearts are 1-1, Kilmarnock are 2-0 ahead against Livingston, and St Mirren lead at Hibs through an incredible 50 yard, halfway line effort from Adam Hammill.\u201d And now Everton pull level, with the Brazilian poking home unmarked at the back post after Newcastle fail to clear a corner. Everton should be level at Goodison, but Federico Fern\u00e1ndez makes a superb block to stop Gylfi Sigurdsson finding an equaliser. Digne\u2019s cross fell to Sigurdsson in the box, 10 yards out, but the Spaniard gets his left boot in the way. Plenty of laughs up at Old Trafford. \u201cJos\u00e9 Mourinho, we want you to stay\u201d sing the Arsenal fans, before belting out a chorus of: \u201cIs this the Emirates?\u201d Oh, and Tyson Fury\u2019s in the directors\u2019 box: A blow for Liverpool, with Joe Gomez carried off with an ankle injury. He\u2019s replaced by Trent Alexander-Arnold. At Molineux, Rui Patr\u00edcio prevents Chelsea from doubling their tally, with the Portuguese superbly keeping out Willian. Spurs take the lead at Wembley, with Eriksen playing in an inviting ball for Harry Kane to slot home beyond Alex McCarthy. They should have seen him coming, really, given the England skipper has scored seven goals in his last six league games against Saints. Advantage Newcastle at Goodison Park, with the on-loan striker Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n notching his fourth goal of the season. Against the run of play, Rond\u00f3n sweeps home at the back post after good work by Jacob Murphy. Meanwhile, Kasper Schmeichel denies Fulham an opener, making a magnificent save to deny Calum Chambers his first goal for the club after hitting a sweet volley. A massive deflection gives Chelsea advantage at Molineux. Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u2019s effort from the edge of the box takes a huge knock of Coady and deceives the Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio. A second goal in two games for Loftus-Cheek. Morgan Gibbs-White is making a dent on his first Premier League start, with the 18-year-old Wolves winger enjoying a lively few minutes against Chelsea. Sarri\u2019s side have had a couple of efforts from distance, with Morata and Hazard both driving over. At Goodison, Cenk Tosun has glanced a header wide from Lucas Digne\u2019s cross, with Everton seemingly growing into that one. Five minutes in at Craven Cottage, Leicester fans are singing Claudio Ranieri\u2019s name, obviously. Lovely stuff. Aleksandar Mitrovic, captain for the evening, has meanwhile just fired a pitiful free-kick straight at Kasper Schmeichel. A couple of early chances: Kelechi Iheanacho was freed by James Maddison, but shot straight at Sergio Rico. Up at Burnley, Liverpool had an early scare when a Robbie Brady ball evaded everybody before bouncing out for a goal-kick. No matter how many goals are scored tonight, it\u2019s going to take something special to top mice-gate woes in Beckenham: And just like that, we\u2019re under way at Craven Cottage, Goodison Park, Turf Moor and Molineux. Southampton, winless since September, have seemingly forgotten how to march and those heady European adventures feel long gone, though the appointment of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl goes some way to answering the question marks over whether there is sufficient appetite to restore them Remember when Leicester were champions? It\u2019s still sinking in. Another intriguing subplot tonight of course is Claudio Ranieri taking on the team he created history with, though the Fulham manager insists the fairytale is very much over. \u201cNow the chairman, Vichai, is dead, the fairytale finished but the memories remain,\u201d the Italian said. \u201cI am very sad for what happened and we have to continue in our life. It will be strange, a very emotional moment. It is not a match like others. Every time I face one of my former teams, there is always more emotion. Football for me is emotion. And Leicester is the club that gifted me a dream.\u201d Meanwhile, another interesting soundbite, courtesy of Mr Sarri, whose Chelsea team take on Pep Guardiola\u2019s purring side this weekend. \u201cManchester City are in another category,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cWe just have to think about the top four. At the moment we are not able to fight with Manchester City.\u201d So, Maurizio Sarri opts to shuffle the pack, because of facing \u201c11 matches in the next 35 days\u201d. F\u00e0bregas, Loftus-Cheek and Andreas Christensen get the nod for Chelsea. And Sarri\u2019s not the only one, with J\u00fcrgen Klopp describing his seven changes as \u201cabsolutely normal in this period of the season\u201d. The Liverpool manager says: \u201cThe midfielders played a lot of games already. We had to change the midfield, the most intense area of the pitch. Using Daniel [Sturridge] was clear; Div [Origi] after the last game makes sense, using the momentum, trying to use it. Alberto [Moreno] \u2013 Robbo [Robertson] played pretty much all the games so far. Gini [Wijnaldum] played a lot of games.\u201d Headline team news: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho makes seven changes to his side, with Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku dropped to the bench. At Wembley, Steven Davis makes his first league start of the season as he captains Southampton in front of new manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, while at Molineux, Ruben Loftus-Cheek gets his first Premier League start under Maurizio Sarri. Meanwhile, J\u00fcrgen Klopp also makes seven changes, with no Salah, Man\u00e9 and Firmino in his starting XI.

Consider last night the compere, this the headline act. Not only is there a Wenger- and Ferguson-less duel between Manchester United and Arsenal for the first time since 1986, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham are also in action. There are endless subplots to ponder and a bottomless Premier League feast to get stuck into. How might Mauricio Pochettino enjoy coming up against his former club, for example? \u201cI care a lot for Southampton,\u201d he said. \u201cI have spoken with my family and I think it was one of the better periods in my life. We found some amazing people there, an amazing town and they provided us with everything.\u201d And what will Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, watching at Wembley, make of the Saints side he has inherited? How will Jordan Pickford respond to that almighty clanger? And will Wolves bounce back from a fifth defeat in six? \u201cWe have had a block of games with mistakes, from a team which is still growing,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo. \u201cWhen the results don\u2019t come, what is important is how you approach the situation.\u201d Premier League fixtures Burnley v Liverpool Everton v Newcastle United Fulham v Leicester City Wolves v Chelsea Tottenham v Southampton (8pm) Manchester United v Arsenal (8pm) *all fixture kick-off 7.45pm unless stated"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
