The Duchy will attempt to resist Bath council's draft policy that would prevent, on environmental grounds, plans for what would be a highly profitable estate near the historic city. It wants to build on farmland that provides meat to local schools and villages in a scheme that risks causing \"significant harm\" to the Bath World Heritage Site, according to an impact study. An application is also pending for the area to be designated an area of outstanding natural beauty. Charles has been forced to defend the move to angry Duchy tenants in the neighbouring village of Newton St Loe who oppose the plans and believe he is putting money ahead of the environment. They wrote to the prince complaining they had been \"fobbed off\", \"patronised\", \"misled\" and \"dealt with in an overly aggressive manner\" by Duchy representatives who handled their complaints. \"We remain bewildered that the Prince of Wales should be encouraging this action,\" said a statement from Newton St Loe parish council. \"He so often describes himself as a defender of nature and the countryside. We cannot understand why the profit from the Duchy development, large as it will doubtless be, should have convinced him that our nature and our countryside do not matter.\" The Duchy is a \u00a3600m investment empire and provides the prince with a \u00a317m-a-year income. Its board, chaired by Charles, who is actively involved in the Duchy's management, agreed last month to challenge the draft policy at the public inquiry this year. The prince is credited with helping to more than double the Duchy's value in the past seven years. Charles is using the argument that \"if development is to happen anyway, it should be done in as sympathetic a way as possible working to the highest standards of sustainable urbanism\", his private secretary, Manon Williams, told villagers. They said they were \"dismayed\" by his stance and argue that building on virgin land is unsustainable when derelict sites close to the centre of Bath are available. The tussle will be embarrassing for the prince. Only last year, his private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, said part of the prince's role was to stand up for \"ordinary people that might not otherwise be heard\" against profiteering property developers. The residents of Newton St Loe had celebrated after the general election when a regional strategy that earmarked the Duchy's site for development was scrapped and a new plan was drafted to steer new house-building on to brownfield sites. The prince's architecture charity, the Foundation for the Built Environment, is to work with the Duchy to \"inform the debate\" around the proposal, Clarence House told the parish, and the Duchy will present research it undertook when the site was originally identified. A spokesman for the Duchy said last night: \"It is entirely normal for a landowner to make a representation as part of a public review and it is clearly helpful if the independent inspector is fully informed so as to be able to make a sound recommendation to the council.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
