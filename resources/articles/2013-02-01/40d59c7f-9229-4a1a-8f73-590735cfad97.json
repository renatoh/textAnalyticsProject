Don't read on if you haven't seen episode two. Catch-up with Jon Wilde's episode one blog here. It says a lot about the second episode of Dancing on the Edge that the most gripping thing about it was the long-range teaser that kicked the whole thing off: go-getting music hack Stanley telling bandleader Louis that they need to get him out of the country pronto. It was the only moment of urgency in an episode that left me wondering how Stephen Poliakoff is going to stretch his tale out to five instalments. Certainly there was an awful lot of stretching in episode two. The hour stretched out on the hearth like an old sheepdog, occasionally wagging its tail to show it was still alive, but obstinately determined to do as little as possible. We opened on a posh kids' birthday party with the Louis Lester Band being outperformed by the arrival of the cake, and one spoiled brat wondering aloud why the band members didn't, as promised, have black-and-white faces. It was a rare reminder of the kind of racism that a real-life version of Louis' band would undoubtedly have faced in 1932. But I wonder how bothered Poliakoff actually is about what was actually going on in 1932. This was a time of grim economic depression, with unemployment reaching 70% in some areas of Britain, but we get not the remotest sniff of that. The only people we meet in this hermetically sealed world are working musicians and toffs enjoying a mutual love-in, thereby offering little opportunity for dramatic conflict. \"What defines this story is how all the characters are involved in this massive crisis of identity and where they belong in any given society, be they aristocrats or all all-black jazz band,\" says Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Louis. \"This cross-fertilisation of cultures and what that brings up in terms of loyalty is at the heart of the story.\" If that's the case, then Poliakoff is taking his time making it apparent. Instead he seems more concerned with hot-stepping it with undue haste to the first obligatory wide shot of the country estate. This opulent pile belongs to Lady Cremore, an imperious jazz-loving Miss Fancy Knickers played by Jacqueline Bisset. She has invited Louis &amp; band to play at a funeral. Suddenly the door of opportunity swings open for the band \u2013 and not before time. Lady Cremore uses her influence to set up an audition where the illustrious audience includes Prince George, a record company executive and a radio producer. Bingo! Louis &amp; Co land their first recording session and their live radio debut. Emerging from the hotel after wooing wireless listeners, Jessie and Carla are greeted by a small gaggle of autograph hunters. Poliakoff has a message for us in this awkwardly played scene. Something about the dawn of celebrity culture. Something like that. Things are hotting up, slightly as the band are summoned by the Prince of Wales to play an RAF dinner. And then, finally, a murder. Bring on the trumpets and dancing girls \u2013 something has actually happened. Louis returns to the hotel to find poor Jessie slumped in a pool of her own blood in the laundry cupboard. I'm no Sherlock Holmes but I have a feeling in my water that the rozzers ought to be looking closely at Masterson and Julian while keeping a beady eye on Masonic Lodge in the hotel basement. Though it's bound to be Louis Lester who gets his collar felt. Poliakoff is often accused of being a far better writer than a director. But, for my money, it's the writing that's at fault here. Like so much of his later work (Friends &amp; Crocodiles, Joe's Palace, Glorious 39), Dancing on the Edge is shaping up to be all style and precious little substance. Two episodes down and we're still waiting for those trumpets and everything else to swing. The music It was the music of the first episode that inspired some of the most heated debate on the blog \u2013 with some feeling that the music was the best thing about the show, and others moaning that it was the least convincing element. One argument was that The Louis Lester Band specialized in the kind of \"Ellington-lite\" jazz you'd naturally expect from an unrecorded expat band playing for upper-class Brits. Another was that it was just a little dull. One commenter declared the musical element of the show a mere MacGuffin and therefore nothing to worry about. During the funeral scene, the band finally got an opportunity to show that they might just contain a bit of grit in their oyster. Not exactly a Treme second line but at least there were signs of life in their jazz at long last, albeit in the midst of death. However, on their radio debut, they attempted to woo listeners with an underwhelming, off-the-shoulder beige number. There was also much debate among readers about the qualities of the two singers. @Turningleaves compared them, favourably, to the Andrews Sisters. On the other hand, @Patsky was reminded of the excruciating experience of watching Diana Ross play Billie Holiday in Lady Sings The Blues. Equally excruciating for me was the sight of Jessie serenading Lady Cremore over breakfast, her voice as flat as a winter flounder. Enterprisingly, she blamed her bum notes on the fact that she'd never clapped eyes on an artichoke before. Full marks for initiative there. Notes and observations \u2022 Stanley scooping an interview with Lady Cremore and putting her on the cover of the Music Express would, I guess, be the 30s equivalent of Mojo magazine choosing someone like the Marquess of Bath as a cover star on the grounds like he had a penchant for skanking around the living-room to Tappa Zukie. \u2022 The foppish Julian is clearly up to no good with his mysterious letter and his even more mysterious trip to Paris. John Goodman's Masterson is mostly conspicuous by his absence but you can smell his Machiavellian malevolence all the way down the hotel corridors that Poliakoff is so fond of. \u2022 In response to Decca Aitkenhead's recent interview with Poliakoff, @popeinrome confidently predicted that Dancing on the Edge would be \"Downton Abbey with trumpets\". On the evidence of episode two they're not too wide of the mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
