What worked at Saturday's big meeting? What did not? And above all, perhaps, given the state of Dubai's economy, will he eventually see a return on his billion-dollar investment? The plan is that Meydan should become a must-visit venue on the racing circuit and the omens on Saturday were mixed. At least the results sent out a message to several continents that there is a great deal of money to be won in Dubai in early spring. Horses from Britain, France, South Africa, Hong Kong and the United States, as well as two trained locally in Dubai, banked winner's cheques from the $26m (\u00a317.5m) prize fund. Others from Australia and Japan went close, while Gloria De Campeao, racing's first six-million- dollar horse thanks to his victory in the Dubai World Cup, was bred in Brazil and is owned by a Swede. That should ensure another strong gathering from around the world next March. And in terms of return business at the turnstiles racegoers who survived long queues in burning heat to get past security eventually found a track that, while still clearly a work in progress, should soon have the kind of facilities and viewing that you would expect when no expense has been spared. There were some memorable moments on the track too, not least in the World Cup itself, which was a three-way photo-finish with the wrong jockey \u2013 Kevin Shea, on Lizard's Desire \u2013 celebrating victory. There was also a scene that will probably be repeated many times over the next few years, as William Buick was led back to the winner's enclosure after a big-race victory for John Gosden earlier on the card. The purse for the Dubai Sheema Classic was so vast \u2013 \u00a35m \u2013 that Buick might ride for another 20 years and not win a richer one. But even at 21 he has the stage presence and coolness under pressure of an elite rider. Classics and major end-of-season races like the Arc and Breeders' Cup surely lie ahead for Buick and the timing of his new contract with Gosden appears as impeccably timed as his ride on Dar Re Mi. Gosden has been around a long time now \u2013 he won a race at the inaugural Breeders' Cup in 1984 when he was based in California \u2013 but has enjoyed some marquee moments in the last 18 months, becoming the first British trainer to win the Breeders' Cup Classic and now winning this huge prize after a winter that should have put any British runner, not least a mare like Dar Re Mi, at a major disadvantage. For Buick and Gosden the new Flat campaign could hardly have had a more promising start. For the Godolphin operation, though, Saturday's card in Dubai had mixed messages. Mahmood al-Zarooni, their new second trainer, won a \u00a31m race with his first runner, Calming Influence, and was less than a head away from taking the World Cup itself with Allybar. Their better-fancied runners, though, from Saeed bin Suroor's wing of the business, ran well below expectations. One card is no basis for firm conclusions but Zarooni will certainly be a name to note when Godolphin return to Britain in the middle of next month. His success on Saturday might also sway Sheikh Mohammed's hand when he decides which horses will go where, potentially adding to Zarooni's early momentum. Saeed bin Suroor, Godolphin's main man for 15 years, will need to keep up with his in-house rival, never mind the rest of Britain's training fraternity. All this will unfold while Meydan stands silent and empty. It was just about fit for purpose on Saturday but there is more to a great racecourse than restaurants and comfy seats. The missing ingredient \u2013 despite no end of acrobats, stunt-riders and fireworks \u2013 was a true racing atmosphere and without it Meydan may struggle to establish itself as anything more than an early-season oddity. The concourses were busy enough but the echoes in the huge interior space meant that Meydan did not feel remotely full. And as the runners turned for home there was little sense of building excitement from the grandstand. Why? Perhaps because it is simply too big to generate a crackle, as the sparks have too far to fly. But the lack of betting \u2013 bar a free Pick 7 lottery restricted to one entry per person \u2013 is surely another element. Unless a fair part of the crowd has some money at stake, they may be interested in a race but never fully intent on it. And for a host of religious, political and cultural reasons, this is something that Sheikh Mohammed may never fully appreciate, far less address. Though the building work seems to have slowed to a crawl, Meydan is the centrepiece of a much wider development with the racehorse as a theme. It has been described as a \"city with a racing heart\". That may be so but what Meydan really needs is some soul"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
