As I write, the south Armagh landscape is slowly slipping past while the Enterprise train picks up speed again en route to Dublin. Some of the hillsides and mountains appear like semi-shaved heads, with vast tracts of woodland and vegetation clipped away to allow cattle and sheep to graze. To my right, you can make out one of the hilltop fortresses that give the British army a commanding view of what was once their most dangerous frontier region. There are traces of times past when even the main road south was like passing into a war zone with only the CCTV cameras at the Kileen crossing point a reminder that this was once a near permanent military checkpoint and the target of republican sorties. It is all slowly but surely turning back into a normal, picturesque mountainous corner of Ireland - too slowly for the majority living there, too quickly for a declining minority who looked up towards the peaks and were somehow reassured at the presence of those spy posts perched on the high ground of south Armagh. As with the pronunciation of the letter 'H', the name of a certain city in the north-west and even the nomenclature for the State itself, there is discord over how to describe the de-escalation of the military presence in Northern Ireland. Republicans prefer the term 'demilitarisation', probably because it implies some form of retreat by the British armed forces. British ministers prefer the phrase 'normalisation', in all likelihood because it points towards a society similar to any other region of the UK free from any vestige of overt military occupation. Somewhere in the middle of these two lies the unionist interpretation of this process, coloured as ever, when it comes to change, with fear and suspicion. Whichever phrase you choose, one thing is certain: movement towards scaling down the British armed forces' presence in Northern Ireland is inexorable as the terrorist threat wanes; the status quo is no longer an option. That is certainly the view of senior British officers serving in the Province. Over lunch in central Belfast last Tuesday, one army officer made it crystal clear that the reduction of troops and the dismantling of the military apparatus would continue regardless of what may emerge at Leeds Castle, Kent, next weekend. He insisted that whatever the outcome, even if the Ulster parties, as is highly likely, fail to reach a deal to restore devolution, the demilitarisation/normalisation process would go on. The most fascinating aspect of our lunchtime conversation was the officer's exasperation over the attitude of unionist politicians towards this process. 'Surely everyone would welcome steps to normalise life in Northern Ireland, especially the unionists,' he kept repeating in a bewildered tone. He has a point because, for more than a quarter of a century, republicans sought to portray Northern Ireland as abnormal and, therefore, an unviable statelet. The IRA's political leaders and their allies often highlighted the existence of a massive and intrusive military presence as physical evidence that the state was not and could never be a normal entity/society. Now that the Provos' 'war' is over, suddenly it is the unionists who are demanding that all those 'abnormal' aspects of militarism - the watchtowers, the spy posts, the permanent vehicle checkpoints - be retained. For decades, it was the unionists who drew comfort from Margaret Thatcher's tenuous assertion that Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley. Now it is the unionists who appear to want 'war-zone Northern Ireland' to be maintained, while republicans steal the glory for helping to transform the State they once tried to destroy into being as near to 'normal' as Thatcher's former constituency. There are 12,000 British servicemen and women under the command of the GOC in Northern Ireland. The normal peacetime garrison is around 5,000 troops. For uncompromising republicans, that would be 5,000 too many but why is it that for unionists it would not be enough? Ask yourself where, barring Ardoyne on the Twelfth, there was a major military deployment anywhere in urban Northern Ireland and the answer is the leafy, prosperous and solidly unionist North Down during the UVF-LVF feud earlier this year. In fact, the last three major military deployments since the start of the century - the Shankill 2000, Holy Cross 2001, North Down 2004 - have all involved the security forces squaring up to loyalist terrorists and their supporters. 'Stable' and 'normal' were never adjectives republicans wanted to see used to describe Northern Ireland. So why are unionists running away from them now, at the very moment in history when it is possible to lay to rest the tradition of physical-force republicanism and thus secure a society no longer under violent, existential threat?
