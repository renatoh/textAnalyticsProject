What were the odds that across the UK 50,000 different groups would voluntarily spend Wednesday nights engaged in amateur literary criticism? Now, famously, chat-show behemoths Richard and Judy have one, as do the residents of Coronation Street. In a postmodern twist, there are even books about book groups. I have similar hopes and dreams for eco groups. Just as a book group represents a fine example of grass-roots literary activism and reader power, the eco group brings environmental activism indoors. Eco-group members leave their Captain Corelli's Mandolin at home, focusing instead on ways to implement energy- and water-saving ideas, composting waste and promoting biodiversity in their gardens. It's revolutionary green activity in the environs of your own home, or someone else's, accompanied by white wine and crisps. Currently their number is small, but eco groups have got all the necessary ingredients to spread fast and furiously, promoting the type of effective, incremental lifestyle changes that can halt environmental degradation and protect resources. In fact, in a bid to become a legend in my own living room, I'm starting my own with a friend who wants to share her enthusiasm for composting. In less than 30 minutes we'd recruited six other friends with latent planet-saving aspirations. Ever the nonconformists, our group will be freestyle, but if you prefer a linear structure with a clear goal, then environmental charity Global Action Plan (020 7405 5633; www.globalactionplan.org.uk) runs an Eco Team scheme complete with action packs. Members meet often over a period of four months to compare notes and discuss practical measures. They use water metres and weigh their rubbish before weekly confess-all meetings. 'There's a very supportive atmosphere,' says Gaia Vince, who recently finished a four-month Eco Team scheme and rather misses it. As a long-time environmentalist and editor of Ergo Magazine (www.ergo-living.com) - the UK's first green-themed glossy - she is hardly lacking in eco know-how, but still benefited from exchanging ideas and views with other members: 'It's about breaking bad habits as well. We were all quite competitive, particularly about recycling, but would also spur each other on. It's actually a bit like WeightWatchers crossed with AA.' Global Action Plan's research into the efficacy of small, local eco groups has uncovered similar encouraging results. In a pilot project in Nottingham, 200 participants, on average, achieved a 43 per cent reduction in waste sent to landfill sites and a 17 per cent drop in energy use. Because from small acorns big oaks grow, so pint-sized, informal groups which began tackling domestic issues lead to even bigger concerns - car clubs, allotment groups, local food co-operatives and lobbying schemes. It's only a matter of time until Richard and Judy host a phone-in on making the most of your compost toilet. lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
