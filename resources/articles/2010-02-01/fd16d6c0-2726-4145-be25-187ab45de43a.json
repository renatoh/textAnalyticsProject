The production has since been to New York's Metropolitan Opera, and its return to the ENO reaffirms its dramatic potency, with giant papier-mache puppets, video projections and eloquently choreographed movement. Much of the cast has returned, too, most importantly Alan Oke in the role of MK Gandhi. As the still focus of Glass's meditation on non-violent protest, he sings with an otherworldly beauty. The high soprano of Elena Xanthoudakis, who plays Miss Schlesen, his secretary, adds a silvery edge to the slowly shifting vocal ensembles. Stuart Stratford conducts this time around and makes the score seem more ravishing than ever, every phrase beautifully balanced, every chord immaculately spaced, a reminder that before minimalism was invented, Glass studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and has maintained the craftsmanship he acquired there. Admiration is redoubled most of all, though, for McDermott and Crouch, who trust the music to work its hypnotic spell, and balance its moments of stasis against the freewheeling, dramatically appropriate imagery. It's a must-see for anyone who missed the first run, and a landmark in recent London opera. In rep until 26 March.
