Hamilton had landed a 40th pole position of his career in Kuala Lumpur despite suggestions that Rosberg had deliberately blocked him on his final run of the rain-affected session. Rosberg had already abandoned his lap, but did not move aside as Hamilton came past, forcing him off the racing line. It turned out not to matter as Hamilton had already done enough for pole on a previous lap. Hamilton played down the incident but Rosberg, from the back of the press conference, decided on an eccentric intervention. \u201cNico Rosberg, Mercedes AMG Petronas,\u201d he began. \u201cThere are a lot of comments on Twitter saying Nico blocked you, is that true he blocked you on your second timed lap?\u201d Hamilton appeared amused and replied: \u201cI think you should probably ask him, I think he\u2019ll have a good opinion on that.\u201d As the assembled journalists laughed, an apparently stung Rosberg shook his head and, despite the evidence, twice said: \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d Rosberg went on to deny he had forced Hamilton to abandon a flying lap, despite the Englishman having set a best in the first sector, claiming: \u201cHe backed off way before coming up on me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
