And that was even after Tuesday, and the Saatchi party nudes - for they were sweet, and brave, and funny, but it was still the first time in my life I've found myself mentally dressing a woman. But on Wednesday, when I was chatting to Michael Caine - it's been one of those weeks for us media tarts, all champagne chitty-chats and celebs and sunshine and honestly how filthy wearing it all gets, frankly I'd rather be down the mines - he mentioned something horrible, and actually shuddered as he said it; and, afterwards, I shuddered too. A remake of Casablanca, with Jennifer Lopez in Ingrid Bergman's role as Ilsa, is not at first the stuff of true nightmares, but think about it some more and shudder. It's not that it's my favourite film. There's something tiresomely snotty about me which resents the fact that so many people call it their favourite film. Don't they just mean they think it should be their favourite, because it's old and it's black and white and their girlfriends like it and they can't remember any other decent ones after years of being fed globulous Hollywood corn, the uncultured prole scum? Actually, maybe they just mean, confusingly, that it's their favourite film. Whatever, it's still pretty good, and it shouldn't be remade, ever. This not to to say that nothing should ever get the remodelling treatment. The second Thomas Crown Affair was far more exciting than the original. La Jet\u00e9e was reworked as Twelve Monkeys, one of the best movies ever. The recent TV adaptation of Lucky Jim showed that we could think, finally, about redoing the film, and begin closure from the ancient celluloid horror that had Ian Carmichael cast as Jim Dixon. And I'd quite like to see a remake of Police Academy VII: The Flatulence Mafia, but starring Robert De Niro, Kenneth Branagh and Meryl Streep (recover from that, chaps). But Casablanca? No. Because you know what they would do. They would have sex, rather than have the promise of sex - and we know, don't we, which is sexier; just as I remembered, at that party, how much sexier it is when someone is wearing a few clothes rather than none at all. They would make Sam a rap star. They would have the Bogart lead - Ben Affleck, Hugh Grant, Stiggy Jawbucket or whoever - being brave and unselfish from the very start, thus losing every tiny flex of tension in the plot. No one would smoke, or drink very much. They would, cripplingly, give it a happy ending. Victor Laszlo would suddenly recall at the very end that he was actually gay (and he'd be being played anyway by William H. Macy), so J-Lo could run straight into Jawbucket's arms and give him a good live boffing on the stairs of the plane (helicopter? spaceship?), and we'd all go home thunderously underwhelmed. Some stories need unhappy endings. Think, especially this weekend, what would have happened had The Greatest Story Ever Told been rewritten to give it a satisfyingly sweet last reel. Good on you Christ boy, say the Romans, you go off and you tell your silly tales, here it's not as if you're not doing any harm to anyone is it, and we'll not be putting you on the cross (although I'm frankly unclear why they'd be Irish Romans). No Christianity, no Crusades, no Inquisition, about a thousand fewer wars and a phenomenal reduction in worldwide hatred, and what a tragedy that would be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
