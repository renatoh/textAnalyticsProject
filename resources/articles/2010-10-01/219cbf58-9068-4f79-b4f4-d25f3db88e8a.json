The Fulham midfielder already talks more sense than Michel d'Hooghe, chairman of Fifa's medical committee, who sees sinister forces at play when he should be watching a football match and seems to believe the police should round up the suspects. \"Some players come on to the field simply to provoke injuries in other persons,\" D'Hooghe told the BBC. \"I have two eyes, I can see what happens. Some acts are really criminal.\" This seems to be missing the point by a million miles. If acts of outright criminality on a football pitch were that easy to spot referees would have no problem identifying them and dealing with the culprits. Bans of more than a year would be in force by now and the police and the courts would already be heavily involved, as clubs sought redress for wanton damage to their most expensive assets. We all have two eyes and we all know that football is not really like that, not even at Blackburn or Wolves. Murphy's charge of brainlessness was much closer to the truth. The Fulham captain argued reasonably and sensibly that managers should take more responsibility for the teams they send out, with specific regard to the ones who try to stop the opposition at all costs by being first to every ball with no thought for the consequences. \"I don't believe players are going out to break legs but there has to be some logic and intelligence involved,\" Murphy said. \"The pace with which some players go into tackles now is ridiculous.\" Another spate of broken legs and ankles in recent weeks appears to confirm fears that the game has speeded up too much for its own good, with tacklers flying through the air like missiles before opponents have much of a chance either to control the ball or prepare themselves for the collision. Yet while an increase in athleticism may have made football more dangerous, in terms of criminality or malice aforethought it is nothing to what used to pass without comment just a few decades ago, when reducers and enforcers were the order of the day and Maradona had to wear shin pads back and front to avoid being kicked to a standstill the way Pel\u00e9 was in 1966. Phil Neville was born in 1977 but even he can remember a time when tackling was more brutal than it is now. \"We don't tackle as hard as we used to,\" the Everton captain said. \"Ten or 15 years ago when I was faced with a tricky left-winger the first thing I had to do was boot him up in the air.\" You can't do that any more, and D'Hooghe's theory that players are deliberately seeking to cause injury does not seem to cover the likelihood that such recognisable hatchet men would now find it difficult to play enough games to make a living. Murphy's contention that over-zealousness bordering on recklessness is to blame is better, though even his argument contained a flaw when he suggested that some teams were more to blame than others. While Blackburn, Stoke and Wolves may have a case to answer, Manchester City do not automatically fall into that category and neither is it easy to imagine Roberto Mancini sending out players who are too \"pumped up\". Nigel de Jong is fresh from a World Cup final, where admittedly he left some fairly infamous bootprints, and before building the Premier League's latest bone-crusher it might be as well to bear in mind that the Dutch midfielder is 5ft 8in tall and weighs 11st. He used to be known as \"Lawnmower\" in his Ajax days, so it may have been unduly lenient of Martin Atkinson not to respond with at least a yellow, but the referee saw it once and ostensibly he reached the ball first. It was brainless, though. Perhaps officials, in addition to all their other duties, should now be instructed to evaluate the intelligence of a challenge before allowing a player to stay on the field. Call it Murphy's Law. Holloway for England \u2013 no, don't laugh, who else is there? Since it was decreed, a little hastily perhaps, that the next England coach must be English, a small field has been getting smaller by the day. Roy Hodgson is apparently out of his depth at Liverpool, Sam Allardyce believes he is better suited to Barcelona than Blackburn, Chris Hughton opted for Ireland as a player while Stuart Pearce, who does not strike many as a genuine contender, has just had his credentials savaged by no less a judge than Danny Mills. \"He relied on a toy horse to pull Man City through and put David James on up front,\" said Mills, possibly holding a grudge at the way Pearce dropped him after taking over at City from Kevin Keegan. \"I'm not sure he can cope with players at the top level.\" Fine, but that leaves four candidates, one of whom had the job the time before last but departed a laughing stock. Steve McClaren deserves all the credit in the world for putting away the brolly and working hard overseas to restore his reputation significantly, yet Sir Trevor Brooking may have been a tad premature in installing him as favourite to succeed Fabio Capello. Another five years of exile and the country might be willing to forgive and forget, but rushing him back in a little over 18 months seems certain to have the rest of the world laughing at us again. Then again, so would appointing Harry Redknapp or Ian Holloway. Steve Bruce appears to be the only straight man left standing. No wonder Holloway has been trying to cut down on the jokes and general wackiness this year. Were it not for his reputation for comedy a manager capable of not only getting Blackpool into the Premier League but outplaying Liverpool at Anfield would normally have a bandwagon behind him by now. Blackpool, one imagines, are being viewed as a temporary top-flight phenomenon, destined to shimmer briefly before disappearing without trace. Only if they are still around in 18 months will Holloway have a chance of being considered. One lives in hope, not least because going straight from Capello to Holloway would constitute classic English comedy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
