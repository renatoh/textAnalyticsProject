Chelsea, who start the weekend 13 points clear at the top, can claim their first league championship in five years by defeating Crystal Palace on Sunday. It will be Mourinho\u2019s eighth league title from his time at Porto, Internazionale, Real Madrid and in two spells at the London club and the manager will have a replica trophy made to commemorate the achievement to add to his personal collection. The real silverware will not be presented to the league winners until after their final home game, against Sunderland on 24 May, though Mourinho is unperturbed at the prospect of waiting a further three weeks even if the title is secured this weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t care, really,\u201d he said. \u201cThe meaning is the important thing: the feeling, the emotion \u2026 that\u2019s what stays with you forever. \u201cI have replicas of every cup I won, and I don\u2019t care about the replicas. Or the medals. They\u2019re in my houses. I have some in Portugal, some here, some in my son\u2019s room. I really don\u2019t care. What stays forever is the feeling, the emotion, the memory of the moment. I have clear in my head every one of these moments I lived. What motivated me are the basic things in football, like when you are a kid you play in the street with your neighbours, three against three, four against four, and you want to win. That\u2019s the most pure feeling in football. \u201cIf you are in a championship, you want to win it. It doesn\u2019t depend on the level you are. To be champions in the Premier League is not a different feeling to winning the championship in League One, League Two or the Conference. The happiness, also the frustrations \u2026 in terms of human feelings, they\u2019re exactly the same. \u201cBut the moment itself, it only lasts for a flash. For that moment a final finishes, or the game that gives you the league ends, you have like a flash of the people you love most, the people who are with you, a little bit of the most important moments that lead to that trophy. It\u2019s like a quick flash. And, with me, five minutes later, I move on. I have to think about next season, to prepare. We need to think about that.\u201d Chelsea have led the division \u2013 barring Tottenham Hotspur topping the table on goal difference for the second full week of the campaign \u2013 all season, re-establishing their advantage in the new year after Manchester City had threatened to haul them in. Mourinho, who will welcome back Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my against Palace but will not risk Diego Costa, has relished the fact that the pressure has always been on the chasing pack. \u201cI prefer that because it depends only on you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people sometimes say: \u2018It\u2019s yours to lose, so you\u2019re under pressure\u2019 \u2026 we are not under pressure. The pressure is on the teams who have to win and wait for us to lose. It happened a bit to us last season. We were winning and winning but we had to wait for the others to drop points. This season, basically since March, when we recovered the distance we\u2019d lost in December, the problem was for the others to deal with. They had to win. \u201cSome of them had fantastic runs. Manchester United had I don\u2019t know how many victories consecutively [six], Arsenal too [eight], but they couldn\u2019t close the gap. This is the real pressure. For us, it was just about us. Nothing else matters. Just us. This weekend we don\u2019t care about Hull City against Arsenal, or United against West Bromwich Albion. It\u2019s just about us. This is the feeling I like. Not to be depending on the others. \u201cI\u2019m never nervous, to be fair. When it goes to the countdown, I like the feeling that we have to force it. We can\u2019t wait for it. I like the feeling of the last month: come on, let\u2019s go, we need four victories, three victories, two. Now we need one. I like this feeling of being almost there but not there. I like this last push.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
