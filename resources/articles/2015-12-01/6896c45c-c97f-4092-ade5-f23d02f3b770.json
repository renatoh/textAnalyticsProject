On Monday the ABC confirmed the former Google executive as its new managing director, to replace Mark Scott in May. \u201cIt is important on an overall basis in budget-constrained times to really look at all options around monetisation,\u201d Guthrie said in her first interview, with Joe O\u2019Brien on ABC News 24. But she said it was too early to make any firm judgments. \u201cEven internationally the Australia Plus channel does carry advertising, so internationally we already have that example \u2013 but as I said it is too early to be making any definitive pronouncements,\u201d she said. Guthrie had the ideal credentials to lead the national broadcaster in the digital era, the chairman of the ABC, Jim Spigelman, said when announcing her appointment. Australian-born Guthrie will be the public broadcaster\u2019s first female managing director in its 83-year history and will continue Scott\u2019s transition of the organisation to a digital-first operation. On Monday the board confirmed she had beaten dozens of local and international candidates to the biggest job in Australian media. The appointment had been widely anticipated in the media in the past week. The remuneration tribunal has increased the salary package for the chief executive of the public broadcaster to $900,000. Scott\u2019s package was $823,613 in 2013-14. Guthrie has had a diverse career, beginning in law in Sydney and working across Europe and Asia for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s broadcasting empire, including Foxtel, BSkyB and the Asia-based Star TV network. She has been at Google since 2011, most recently as managing director of agencies for the Asia Pacific, based in Singapore Her interview with O\u2019Brien reflected how long she has been outside Australia. All the characters and programs she mentioned when asked about her memories of the ABC are long gone. Guthrie: \u201cWhether it was Benita on Playschool, that dates me right? Or the Inventors \u2013 I used to love the Inventors. My husband \u2018is\u2019 Harry Butler. My daughters talk about their dad being Harry Butler. It was part of the fabric of my growing up. It\u2019s incredibly important to me that it is in the fabric of my daughters\u2019 lives and my daughters\u2019 daughters\u2019 lives.\u201d Benita Collings hosted Play School for 30 years, from 1969 to 1999 and recorded her last program 16 years ago. The Inventors aired in the 1970s and Butler, known for his 1970s and 80s TV series In the Wild with Harry Butler, died last week. Spigelman confirmed the new managing director would retain the role of editor-in-chief \u2013 with ultimate responsibility for all of the ABC\u2019s editorial content in news and entertainment \u2013 as specified in the ABC Act. Malcolm Turnbull, when he was communications minister, had suggested the job be split in two: a chief executive and an editor-in-chief. \u201cThe ABC board made this appointment following a thorough local and international search that produced an outstanding field of candidates,\u201d Spigleman said. \u201cMichelle is an exceptional media professional with strong content, operational and board experience within internationally respected media companies. \u201cMichelle brings a unique local and global view to the role, having grown up in Sydney and worked at senior levels here and around the world. She brings to the ABC her business acumen, record in content-making across an array of platforms, a deep understanding of audience needs and corporate responsibility for promoting issues like diversity. \u201cWe have no doubt she is the right person to succeed Mark Scott next year and to lead the corporation in its broadcasting and digital work as both are defined by the ABC charter.\u201d Scott, a former Fairfax Media executive and journalist, has been managing director of the public broadcaster for 10 years, taking it from a traditional linear broadcaster of radio and television to a multiplatform media operation which has led the way with podcasting, iView and 24-hour news. In Guthrie\u2019s first public statement since news leaked ahead of her appointment, the former media lawyer said it was an honour to be chosen. \u201cHaving grown up with the ABC and having been a professional observer of it over the last three decades, I have profound respect for the important role the national broadcaster plays throughout Australia and internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cI would also like to acknowledge the leadership provided by Mark Scott during his tenure as managing director. It is fortunate that I will be able to work closely with him during the handover next year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
