It is balls. We only mention it because a similar sort of knock-on karma was experienced by the Fiver this very morning, after Southampton announced Gordon Strachan's intention to quit at the end of the season due to the \"demands and pressures\" of the job; upon hearing this news, we immediately had a walloping great panic attack at the mere thought of all the extra work we'd have to do as a result of this bombshell. But after diagnosing that our seizure was merely a consequence of last night's entertainment - nine cans of Purple Tin, a hearty pinch of snuff, and an early-hours brawl in a chippy over the last bag of crispy bits - we got a grip and a sense of perspective, and set about calmly cut-and-pasting text from the club's statement the way only we (and millions of other users of Microsoft Word) can. \"A new contract has been under discussion for some time now but Gordon has decided that, for medical and other personal reasons, he needs a break from the demands and pressures that are associated with being a Premier League football manager.\" There. Easy. What were we so worried about? Eh, things like this: with deadline fast approaching, Gordon decided to announce that stress had eff all to do with his decision to leave, the wee get. Panic on! \"I am not going anywhere else and I am not cracking up so people can stop looking too deeply into it,\" said Strachan, as beads of cold sweat formed on the Fiver's brow. \"It is not stress either,\" he added, while the walls in Fiver Towers moved in and out at an alarmingly rapid rate. \"The only thing wrong with my health is my hip which needs replacing,\" he then quipped, as the Fiver raced off to see its cognitive behavioural therapist before writing a tidy pay-off. RUMOUR MILL SAINTS JOB SPECIAL, A FEATURE NOT IN ANY WAY CREATED BECAUSE WE FORGOT TO MENTION SPECULATION ABOUT STRACHAN'S SUCCESSOR IN THE STORY ABOVE Mark Hughes! Paul Sturrock! Micky Adams! Paul Jewell! Peter Reid! QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Against Middlesbrough [on Wednesday] I performed one of the worst matches of my career. Maybe this was no accident\" - Was it Louis Saha's professionalism that first attracted Sir Fergie? THE STAND-UP SHOW Strange but true: the Fiver is often accused of not being funny. (\"You mean this is supposed to be funny?\" - Fiver readership.) So, in an attempt to change all that, it's time to dust down the Guardian's mung-bean stained dinner jacket and woo the crowds with a few choice one-liners. Ladeez and Gentleman, we thank-you! Q: How does Harry Kewell change a lightbulb? A: He holds it in the air, and the world revolves around him! [Fiver performs Barrymore-esque skip before acting out a mock cymbal crash; nobody laughs] And did you hear about Dave Jones? Apparently he was caught speeding on his way to Molineux today. \"I'll do anything for three points,\" he said when questioned! [Loud groan interrupted by sound of specially-sharpened bottle whistling through the air and trimming Fiver's sideburns in half] Christ... eh... OK, what about this one? Liverpool have signed hapless Wales keeper Paul Jones! [Hearty guffaws by coach parties from Southampton and Manchester] \"This move is a dream come true,\" said Jones. \"The deal is only for a month but from my point of view it's a month at one of the biggest clubs in Europe, if not the world.\" That's satire, eh? [Tears running down face of coach party from Merseyside, for possibly varied reasons] Hey, and according to Auxuerre coach Guy Roux, Liverpool will also sign \u00a314m-rated striker Djibril Cisse in the summer. \"He was at Liverpool at the start of the week, that is true,\" said Roux. \"Now we know the player wants to go there, he has negotiated and found an agreement with the club. Now we will negotiate with the English officials.\" Hold on, folks, did I say \u00a314m-rated? I meant \u00a314m-OVERrated! Heh! Did you hear that? Did you hear it? And another thi- [Second bespoke bottle slices Fiver's face clean off] THE RUMOUR MILL Bobby Robson thinks Eidur Gudjohnsen is the man to make Newcastle great again, though he is 71, you know. David O'Leary will pinch \u00a32m from Doug Ellis's purse when the old boy nods off, with which he'll treat himself to Nolberto Solano. And Henrik Pedersen has demanded showdown talks with burly Bolton boss Sam Allardyce after being left out of the squad for the midweek defeat by Manchester United. \"I demand showdown talks because I can't understand it,\" he said, in the style of a cliched hack. NEWS IN BRIEF Good/bad news for Liverpool: Steve Dunn has agreed to review El-Hadji Diouf's red card at Chelsea on Wednesday, which could save the striker a one-match ban. Having finalised his pre-contract agreement with Manchester United, Celtic starlet Liam Miller today sang from the club's official song-sheet. \"It's very exciting and is going to be a challenge to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world,\" he warbled. Notts County have appointed Coventry coach Gary Mills as manager following Bill Dearden's departure earlier this week. Ronaldo wasn't in London discussing a move with Chelsea suits this week. Oh no. \"It's totally false that I had dinner in London with anyone linked to Chelsea,\" he said today, a little too specifically for the Fiver's liking. \"It's true that it's the second time that I've been in London recently and I have to return in the future because I have publicity obligations with Nike and some other personal business.\" And with Sir Fergie and Paul Scholes being named Barclaycard manager and player of the month for December, the Fiver reckons it's time for a celebratory double honk - Honk! Honk!! Honk!!! TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: World Football (4.35am) New Year Resolutions, dragged kicking and screaming to the end of the week. Phew. Sky Sports 1: All Sports Show (6pm, 10pm &amp; 4am) \"I couldn't help but notice that yesterday's Fiver was mildly amusing, for the first time in ages,\" writes Wil McAllister, with one L. \"Have you made a New Year's Resolution of your own that you're not telling us about?\" Premier League Preview Show (7pm, 11pm &amp; 5am) But they're not all so chipper. Sky Sports 2: West Brom v Walsall - Live! (7.30pm, repeated SS3: 1am) \"I resolve to never again read the last section of the Fiver, the name of which escapes me,\" vows John Butt. \"It's time I just won't get back.\" Radio 5 Live: Sport on 5 (7pm) Piers Gee sounds more like a cruiseline \"turn\" than a Fiver reader, but at least he knows the name of the section he's denigrating. Talksport: Football First (7pm) \"I resolve to stop resolving never to read TV &amp; Radio again,\" he snorts. \"Or maybe to see someone about the fact that I keep reading it.\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off The Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) You can still email resolutions, to the.boss@theguardian.com, but unless we lose the email entitled \"Dumb Colleagues\" between now and Monday, we won't be using any of them.
