As Nick Griffiths lay in a hospital bed last year after succumbing to frostbite in the Yukon Arctic race in northwest Canada, the world\u2019s coldest ultra-marathon, his mind drifted to an advertisement he had seen earlier in a hotel in the territory. \u201cIt said: \u2018Had frostbite? We want your toes,\u2019\u201d Griffiths told the Guardian. \u201cI thought it was a bit of a joke, really.\u201d It was not. For more than 40 years, visitors have flocked to the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City for a chance to try the country\u2019s most infamous drink: the Sourtoe Cocktail. The beverage consists of a mummified human toe floating in a whiskey shot; patrons must let the digit \u2013 or its blackened nail \u2013 touch their lips in order to receive a certificate and qualify for admittance to the Sourtoe Cocktail Club. Upon returning home to Bolton, Griffiths learned he would lose three of his toes to the frostbite. He asked the surgeon to keep them. During his recovery, he began corresponding with the Downtown Hotel about possibly donating the digits, but his physical rehabilitation and work hours complicated plans to travel to Yukon. Months passed and Griffiths kept his toes in jars \u201cjust in my bedside drawer\u201d. Finally, after much back and forth with the hotel, he suggested simply mailing them to Canada. At the post office, he panicked after being asked what was in the polythene envelope. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything. I didn\u2019t want to just blatantly lie and say it was a candle or whatever.\u201d He told the postal clerk he was mailing his toes \u2013 and wrote \u201cNovelty gift\u201d on the envelope. He kept one of the toes as \u201cinsurance\u201d because, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure really you should be posting toes.\u201d More than a month later, the toes arrived in Dawson City. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier to receive a new toe. They are very hard to come by these days,\u201d said the hotel in a statement. Terry Lee, the hotel\u2019s \u201ctoe expert\u201d will now preserve the digits in rock salt for at least six weeks before they are served in whiskey. \u201cThe big toe is the money toe,\u201d Lee told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cWe usually don\u2019t get frostbitten toes. Usually, they\u2019re from gout or diabetes, or they\u2019re lawnmowers or chainsaws or accidents \u2026 to get a frostbitten toe, that\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d There are currently three toes in use. In recent years, the hotel has grappled with a spate of toe thefts, and the hotel now nails anyone who attempts to swipe a toe with a fine of C$2,500 (\u00a31,500). The establishment is now trying to convince Griffiths to make the trip to the Yukon to try the cocktail. He is not sure if anyone has ever sipped the whiskey with their own toe swirling around, but is keen to be the first. \u201cPeople look at you as though you\u2019re a bit mad, he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a nice little bit of fun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
