Aimed at millennials, the range will be prominently displayed in dedicated bays for just 14 weeks, with shoppers asked to tell the grocery chain what it should keep to stay ahead of fast-evolving food and drink trends. Shelf banners and labels read: \u201cIf you love it, we\u2019ll keep it.\u201d Only those that sell well will secure longer-term, permanent listings. The so-called Taste of the Future scheme is the next phase of Sainsbury\u2019s Future Brands initiative, set up in April 2018 to find distinctive products and support their growth through a \u201chot-housing\u201d programme offering brands mentoring and other help. Edible roasted crickets launched by Sainsbury\u2019s last November \u2013 in a UK supermarket first \u2013 were introduced under this model and are selling strongly as an alternative, sustainable food source. The new range is made up of 30 products \u2013 created by 11 startup brands \u2013 and also includes the UK\u2019s first alcoholic kombucha (a fermented drink made from sweetened tea), seaweed-infused rapeseed oil and a pocket-sized elderflower spritzer. They will go on sale in 69 larger Sainsbury\u2019s stores from Monday. As it seeks to gain an edge over its big four rivals, Sainsbury\u2019s research shows younger shoppers are keen to try out edgy products in emerging categories and trends \u2013 including plant-based and alcohol-free \u2013 that also have eco-credentials. They increasingly value and seek out products with a hand-crafted nature rather than commoditised, bland foods, it found. Rachel Eyre, head of Future Brands, said: \u201cIn the first year [of Future Brands], we have found and introduced some amazing products from up-and-coming challenger brands across food, drink, household and personal care, and our customers loved them. We are very excited by this next wave of innovation.\u201d With kombucha now one of the fastest growing drinks categories in the UK, one of the first products to be trialled will be Bootleg Booch, a lower sugar organic, alcoholic kombucha hailed for its \u201cbold botanic flavours and crisp fresh finish\u201d. Also in the first wave are flavoured Sea Chips \u2013 handcrafted crisps made from salmon skin that would otherwise go to waste. Time-poor consumers can pick up a gluten-free, lactose-free vegan meal in a bottle from French brand Feed, alongside solid alternatives in bars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
