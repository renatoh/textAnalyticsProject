Former chief executive Mr Holmes decided three years ago to break the firm's 47-year ties with Michael House, where the seemingly endless warren of corridors and meeting rooms had become an emblem of all that was staid and tired about the retail group. The move to smaller, more modern offices in Paddington has come with 650 job losses. But Mr Holmes's successor, Stuart Rose, is bound to hope that the unceremonious auctioning of the contents of the Baker Street site - from drinks cabinets to silver tableware - will help draw a line between the old boardroom regime and the leaner, meaner new head office operation. Other items featured in the auction, which will be open to the public on November 24 and 25, include nine plasma screens; a number of reproduction leather-inlaid desks, tables and bookcases; and 500 prints, pictures and photographs. More eclectic items up for sale include 60 shop mannequins; a panoramic view of London in 1647; a pizza oven; and 2,000 stacking chairs. Having announced a 40% drop in profit earlier this week as well as suggesting that revamping stores could cost as much as \u00a31.25bn, Mr Rose is keen to stress his cost-conscious credentials. Head office staff are still adjusting to his decision, revealed on Tuesday, to halve Marks &amp;Spencer's board level executive team from six to three. Among those to go are finance director Alison Reed, director of mens and childrenswear Maurice Helfgott and Mark McKeon, director of retail, international and franchises. The doors of Michael House will be thrown open at 10.30am and the auction is being conducted by industrial asset disposal firm Henry Butcher."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
