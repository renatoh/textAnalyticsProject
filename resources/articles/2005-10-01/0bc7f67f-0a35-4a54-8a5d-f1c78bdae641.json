After United's Champions League tie against Lille at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, which ended in a disappointing 0-0 draw, Ferdinand was told to take Wednesday off as a rest day. \"I turned up for training and, when I got there, I was told it was a day off,\" a confused Ferdinand said yesterday. \"I didn't realise.
