Geraint Thomas still has the look of a lad - apple-cheeked, barely a wrinkle, not even the hint of a crowsfoot - which makes his face almost unique among the emaciated, lined visages of his peers in this year's race. Fresh-faced he may be, but at the age of barely 21 the Cardiff-born Thomas does not seem out of his depth and offers no hint of being at all overwhelmed by the occasion. \"I'm loving it,\" he says, with a hint of Welsh lilt in his voice. \"Gee has a soft face, but he's like one of the penguins in the film Madagascar. He looks cuddly but every now and then you get a look from him which makes you realise he's anything but,\" says David Millar, who has spent time training with Thomas and the other riders in the Olympic academy squad. Perhaps that name will stick: the Penguin, a new addition to cycling's bestiary alongside the Badger (Bernard Hinault), the Eagle of Toledo (Federico Bahamontes) and the Little Goat (Jean Robic). The first Welshman in 40 years to ride the Tour - the only previous one was Colin Lewis in 1967 - Thomas has been tipped as a future star since he won the junior version of the Paris-Roubaix Classic in 2004. After missing most of 2005 following a severe crash which necessitated the removal of his spleen, he came back in 2006 to form part of the British quartet that won silver in the senior 4,000m team pursuit world track championship, and capped that with gold this April. It is a huge leap from a four-minute effort on the track to 2,000-plus miles on the roads of France. Thomas has gone into the unknown in this Tour, which is his first race in the elite ProTour calendar, in his first season as a professional, and he will go into truly unfamiliar territory this weekend when it enters the Alps - his most testing outing to date was the Tour of Trentino in the Italian Dolomites. His aim is to get to Monday's rest day in Tignes at least, and then take stock. \"Two months ago I wouldn't have thought I would be here. I'm here for the experience, so I want to get stuck in and have fun. It's faster than I expected, nothing like you can imagine. Usually in a professional race they hit 60 kilometres per hour 3km from the finish, here it's 15-20km out. I don't feel out of my depth, I can do my job.\" Thomas has been playing a team role, aiming to get Barloworld's sprinter Robert Hunter into a prime position in the final kilometres, and last Wednesday their efforts were almost rewarded when the South African finished close behind Thor Hushovd at Joigny. Yesterday he finished a highly promising 15th in the long stage into Bourg-en-Bresse. Thomas's professional team manager, the Italian Claudio Corti, believes his new signing's speed means he has the capacity to become a top sprinter \"in three or four years\". Corti added: \"There is no point in restricting him. We have to use races like the Tour to move him forward physically - you can see he has some fat to lose - but the key thing is that he can ride at 60 kilometres per hour.\" Occasionally, as the sprinters wind it up for the finish, Thomas finds himself alongside his former academy companion Mark Cavendish, but there is no time to talk. \"In the finale we're too busy breathing, holding the wheel.\" The Tour has, though, given the Penguin and the Cannonball, as the Manx fastman is known, at least one moment to savour. \"We've been racing with each other since we were 13 or 14, little races in the north of England and that. When the Tour started me and him and Dave were alongside each other at Tower Bridge right at the front, that was really special, quite surreal.\" Thomas, as yet, is not sure where his future lies. \"I'm not a pure sprinter like Cav, but I've got a bit of a kick and I can get over the climbs at the end of a hard race. I'd like to think I could evolve into someone like Max Sciandri.\" The Anglo-Italian, who acts as liaison with professional teams on behalf of the British Olympic squad, was a fine one-day racer who at various times made the top 10 in almost every major one-day classic on the calendar, so Thomas's is no small ambition there. Medium-term, he has his eyes on the Beijing Olympics and he will not let a professional road-racing career distract him from London in 2012. For the British Olympic squad, it is a win-win situation; having squad riders like Thomas and Cavendish in the Tour should make them stronger and faster when they return to the track. \"Everything I do this year to get stronger and fitter is a bonus. Even if I only get to the rest day it's the toughest eight days I've had in my life, which can only be a good thing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
