Addressing an audience at New York University on Friday afternoon, the former secretary of state outlined a proposal to reshape the federal tax code. She said this would encourage investors to focus on \u201clong-term growth\u201d and abandon \u201ca culture of short-term speculation\u201d. Clinton said that while she understood \u201cthat most CEOs are simply responding to very real pressures from shareholders and the market to turn in good quarterly numbers ... the system is out of balance\u201d. To the former secretary of state, \u201creal value comes from long-term growth and not short-term profits\u201d. Clinton outlined \u201cfive areas of focus\u201d, including taxing capital gains on a six-year sliding scale; doubling the period of time that capitol gains are taxed at the top rate of 39.6%; and condemning the influence of activist shareholders \u201cdetermined to extract the maximum profit in the minimum amount of time\u201d. The former secretary of state also called for changing corporate incentives on CEO pay and, in particular, implementing regulations on disclosure of CEO pay under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Clinton again endorsed raising the minimum wage. While she fell short of endorsing a nationwide minimum wage of $15 an hour, as demanded by many on the left, she did endorse a proposal to raise the minimum wage to that level for fast-food workers in New York City and noted \u201cthe high cost of living in Manhattan\u201d. The speech prompted criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. On the right, a spokesman for the presidential campaign of the Republican Florida senator Marco Rubio repeated a familiar attack line by condemning Clinton\u2019s proposals as \u201cthe outdated policies of yesterday\u201d. On the left, Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of the progressive group Democracy for America, said the former secretary of state had not gone far enough in her proposals for Wall Street reform. \u201cWorking to end short-termism on Wall Street will definitely help working families in important ways,\u201d said Chamberlain. \u201cBut let\u2019s be really clear: the Democratic party doesn\u2019t want, and the American people don\u2019t need, another Democratic president who tip-toes around Wall Street\u2019s insatiable greed, makes corporate shills like Third Way happy, or portrays common sense, time-tested solutions to \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 like Glass-Steagall as too simplistic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
