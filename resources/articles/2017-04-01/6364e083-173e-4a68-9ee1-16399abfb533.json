Hazard, who scored his 15th league goal in the midweek victory over Southampton, will seek to maintain his outstanding form at Everton on Sunday as the leaders attempt to stretch their advantage back to seven points before Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s participation in the north London derby later in the day. The Belgian still has three years to run on his \u00a3200,000-a-week contract at Stamford Bridge but, while Chelsea are expected to offer new terms as a reward for his contribution this season, Hazard revealed earlier this week that talks of an improved deal have yet to take place. That appears to have fuelled Real\u2019s interest in a player who has constantly been linked in Spain with a move to the Bernab\u00e9u and for whom Madrid would apparently be willing to pay a world record fee. Regardless, Conte expects Chelsea to strengthen heavily this summer, rather than lose key performers before a return to the Champions League, and is planning for life with the 26-year-old still in the ranks. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this idea [to let Hazard leave] is in the mind of the club,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cI think we have to improve the team, to reinforce the team. But you know that, in football, there is also the will of the player. \u201cI think Eden is very happy to stay in Chelsea, to stay with us and work with us. I can tell this. But the future? I haven\u2019t a crystal ball, no. I think everything is possible. Everything is possible in football and not only for Eden but for every single player. Everything is possible. You must understand that there are different wills to compare and then to take the decision.\u201d Asked if he could guarantee that Hazard would stay at the club, Conte added: \u201cI think that it\u2019s impossible for me to take this responsibility, not only for Eden but for every single player. In this situation it\u2019s the club who have the final decision. The club has the final word about this situation. I think it\u2019s right for it to be like this.\u201d Conte, while reluctant to comment on Hazard\u2019s injury-hampered 2015-16 campaign, has spied improvement in the Belgium playmaker under his stewardship this term. \u201cMy opinion of Eden is he\u2019s a great player,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. \u201cHe has great talent. This season he improved a lot, not only on the pitch but also, I think, he\u2019s becoming stronger. Mentally stronger. At this level it\u2019s very important to try to have this step because it brings you up to [the same level as] the best players in the world. And Eden is starting to take this step. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if he is \u2018more mature\u2019 because, last season, I wasn\u2019t the coach. I didn\u2019t work with him. I can only talk about this season but I see a player with good maturity, a player who wants to be decisive during the game. I can tell this.\u201d The player, who does not operate with an agent, has indicated he is relaxed over any prospective contract offer. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised about that because, I repeat, I think Eden is very happy to stay with us and work with us,\u201d added Conte. \u201cI think his family is very happy to stay here and play for this team, for this club. The fans love him and I think there are a lot of positive things that bring him to stay here and to try to reach the best with this club. Don\u2019t forget, the target of this club is to try to win in every competition we play in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
