The Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook is to join Liverpool\u2019s Dominic Solanke and the Norwich goalkeeper Angus Gunn, who is on loan from Manchester City, in the senior squad for the game at Wembley having played in the juniors\u2019 2-0 European Championship qualifying win in Ukraine on Friday. The three were being checked by the Football Association\u2019s medics on Saturday night with Southgate, having originally envisaged elevating Solanke \u2013 a scorer at Kiev\u2019s Obolon Arena \u2013 Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Demarai Gray, opting instead for players in positions where the seniors require greater cover. Southgate had described the decision to blood more youngsters, who had made such a favourable impression in the eye\u2011catching success in junior tournaments over the summer, as a no brainer after seeing a young England team draw 0-0 with the reigning world champions, Germany, on Friday. Cook captained the under-20s to their World Cup win and Solanke earned the tournament\u2019s Golden Ball with four goals in England\u2019s success, with their elevation to the squad to play Brazil part of the senior setup\u2019s long-term strategy to offer a pathway to progress. \u201cI\u2019ve got to assess who are the players that I think could play at the highest level,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cThey might not be 100% ready now, but who do we want to invest our time in? Ruben [Loftus\u2011Cheek], [Joe] Gomez, when he came on, and Jordan Pickford have shown some really good qualities. [Harry] Winks is the same. We had to get the balance through qualification. We had to qualify and then we could start to look at some of these guys and see what was possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to all happen before the World Cup, and some of them might not be ready for next summer, but there are exciting young English players coming through which is encouraging. \u201cWhether it is me that benefits from that or the next manager, the reason I was given the job was that I have an understanding of what is coming through. We\u2019ve looked at what Germany have done over a period of time and want to establish a pathway for our young players. If we do that, the technical type of player that is coming through our system now and the athletic profile we have got could be really exciting. \u201cOur job is to analyse why other countries\u2019 teams are being successful and what does our system look like. I have to say huge credit to the clubs for developing the sort of players they are developing, but we would be foolish not to see the signs of Spain and Germany being successful following on from success at youth level and sticking with some continuity with the way they play and the people involved. \u201cFor me it is all about the bigger picture and what is right for England. I haven\u2019t enjoyed watching us play in all our games but away in Germany, against Spain and Germany at home I\u2019ve enjoyed the performance.\u201d Joe Hart will start in goal against Brazil although Jack Butland would have played had he not broken a finger in training on the eve of the Germany match. Phil Jones, England\u2019s most capped starter on Friday, with 24 appearances, aggravated a slight thigh problem picked up in Manchester United\u2019s defeat at Huddersfield and is to return to Manchester United for treatment and is ruled out, with Gary Cahill likely to step back into the side. Marcus Rashford should start, but Southgate will assess Loftus-Cheek, Gomez and Tammy Abraham to determine the extent of their involvement. \u201cThe Germany game will have taken a lot out of all of them, and Tuesday will be a much harder test because of the effort we put in,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cVery often you can go into one game and do really well and then you have to find that level of performance so quickly again. We\u2019ll have to think about the team we pick and who is ready, but whatever happens these two games will be a brilliant experience for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
