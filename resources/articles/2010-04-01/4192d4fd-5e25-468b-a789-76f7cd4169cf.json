The culinary smoke will not scorch on to his reputation as it did with an earlier top English statesman \u2013 but then Alfred the Great took the trouble to burn the cakes himself. Much of what we imagine we know about Wessex's ninth-century philosopher king (although not the cake myth) can be traced to the account of the Welsh monk Asser, who had been invited to the Alfredian court, so his flattering portrait invites the caution that authorised biographies always require. But even concentrating on the more definitively established parts of his record, there is plenty to support the processions and sponsored cycle rides that are this spring commemorating the 900th anniversary of his reburial at Hyde Abbey, and indeed the \"great\" tag, which is unique in the English royal line. Not that he was, technically speaking, ever the king of England \u2013 rather he created the idea of the nation, whose first sovereign would be his grandson. He provided its eventual capital by refounding London on the old Roman site, and took the first tentative step towards a unified legal code, by collating disparate local laws. A scholar himself, he created schools for the nobility, and commissioned the Anglo-Saxon chronicles which remain the chief historical source for the era. He won victories against the Vikings, but he followed these with consolidation rather than triumphalism. On that last count, at least, the warrior princes of our own times would do well to follow his lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
