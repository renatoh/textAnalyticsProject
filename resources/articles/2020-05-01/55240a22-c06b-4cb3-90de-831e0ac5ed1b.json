Boris Johnson was challenged by the Labour leader, MPs and members of the public over ambiguities and contradictions in the government\u2019s new guidelines. Starmer has been broadly supportive of the government\u2019s approach to dealing with the crisis \u2013 but he has stepped up his criticism in recent days, amid what Labour regards as mixed messages about the next steps. \u201cWhat we needed from the prime minister last night was clarity and reassurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister said he was setting out a roadmap, but if we\u2019re to complete the journey safely a roadmap needs clear directions.\u201d Johnson delivered his broadcast to the nation on Sunday night, urging the public to \u201cstay alert\u201d \u2013 but full details of the planned changes were not published until Monday afternoon. After a day of confusion over exactly what the message meant, with ministers and MPs giving apparently contradictory answers on the airwaves when defending the policy, the prime minister conceded that the message had become more complex than the \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d slogan of the past six weeks. He said that the government was now relying on people to use their commonsense and doubled down on the \u201cstay alert\u201d message by saying it was similar to one being used by the French president, Emmanuel Macron: \u201cSauvez des vies, restez prudents\u201d (save lives, be careful). Pooja, one of the members of the public who were given the chance to put questions to the prime minister at Monday\u2019s press conference, asked him why he had \u201cbeen so vague\u201d about who should be going back to work. Another, a primary school teacher called Kate, asked why she could mix with the children she is teaching but not with members of her family. Dominic Raab had earlier suggested it would now be acceptable for someone to meet both their parents, in a park. But Johnson contradicted that, saying: \u201cYou have to do it one-on-one, outdoors\u201d. Starmer said the most important question the government had failed to answer clearly was: \u201cWhen we could see our loved ones again?\u201d And in the House of Commons, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s not consensus either on messaging now or on policy between the UK government and those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, not something I know he [Johnson] wanted to see but now we\u2019re in that position, [which] raises serious concerns, with a real danger of divergence. \u201cWhat the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and at the moment both are in pretty short supply.\u201d Former Tory cabinet minister David Davis, who has criticised the lockdown, said that in lifting it, \u201cthe government should be thinking just as much about families as about economics\u201d. In other developments on Monday: \u2022 The government announced it would advise the public to wear face-coverings, in places where they cannot distance themselves from others. \u2022 Johnson said lockdown could be swiftly reimposed in a particular local area if a new outbreak is detected \u2013 a process he compared to \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d. \u2022 Unions welcomed changes to the safety-at-work guidance for reopening workplaces, saying they were \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d. \u2022 Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance sidestepped the question of whether they signed off the \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan, saying they weren\u2019t communications experts. In the 60-page \u201cPlan to Rebuild\u201d, the government set out details of what it called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of its approach to dealing with the virus. Described as an \u201cindicative roadmap\u201d, it suggests dates when more of the economy may reopen \u2013 but stresses they are dependent on data. Vallance said he and his colleagues had \u201cstrongly supported the conditionality\u201d of the government\u2019s approach, and each step would have to be science-based, not \u201cdate-based\u201d. More outdoor activities will be allowed, and more people who cannot work from home will be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their workplaces. But at the same time, the government said \u201csmarter controls\u201d would be imposed, in order to help more areas of the economy reopen when possible. These include the use of face coverings, encouraging the public to wash their clothes regularly, and changes in work-practices including working from home where possible, cutting down on face-to-face contact and improving ventilation. The measures are expected to become a \u201cnew normal\u201d until an effective vaccine or treatment for the virus can be found. Addressing MPs about the government\u2019s plans, Johnson insisted the UK should continue to confront the crisis as one, despite suggestions from the Welsh and Scottish governments that he has recklessly abandoned the \u201cStay Home\u201d message too soon. \u201cDifferent parts of the UK may need to stay in full lockdown longer, but any divergence should be only short term because, as prime minister of the UK, I am in no doubt that we must defeat this threat and face the challenge of recovery together,\u201d he said. There was also confusion about when the latest changes would come into effect. Johnson had appeared to suggest on Sunday that they were immediate. But Raab, who was sent out to explain the government\u2019s approach on Monday as workers in London crowded on to the tube, said they would not start until Wednesday, once employers had received fresh advice on how to work safely. Nine sets of new \u201cCovid-secure\u201d workplace guidance were published on Monday evening, after days of consultations with unions and business groups. The TUC had rejected an earlier draft of the advice, saying it was too loosely worded. But its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said they were \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d. \u201cAll employers must now carry out and publish risk assessments in consultation with unions and their workforces. After the confusion of the last few days working people will only feel confident if government and employers act now to make safer working a reality in every workplace,\u201d she said. Johnson later insisted that no one should be returning to an unsafe workplace, and there would be \u201cspot inspections\u201d to ensure compliance by employers. \u201cIn saying that people who can\u2019t work from home should now go to work we are absolutely categorical their workplace, your workplace must be safe, must be Covid-secure,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployers will not be allowed to get away with forcing people to work in conditions that are not Covid-secure.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 May 2020 to render the translation of Macron\u2019s advice \u201crestez prudents\u201d more accurately as \u201cbe careful\u201d rather than \u201cstay alert\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
