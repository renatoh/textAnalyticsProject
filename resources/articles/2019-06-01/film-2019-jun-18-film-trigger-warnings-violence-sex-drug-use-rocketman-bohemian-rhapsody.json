These scenes are necessary to a faithful account of John\u2019s life, but their inclusion prompts the question: should trigger warnings be issued before the film? In New Zealand, the classification of last year\u2019s A Star Is Born was changed to include an explicit suicide warning after two young people were \u201cseverely triggered\u201d by the film. There were also calls for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma to include trigger warnings for a particularly distressing scene that the actors themselves were unaware would be included. Although the events of John\u2019s life are no secret, it was never certain what would and wouldn\u2019t be included in the film. In contrast, Bohemian Rhapsody barely touches on Freddie Mercury\u2019s heavy drug use; a mound of suspicious-looking white powder shown once is supposedly symbolic of years of addiction. Rocketman is certainly sensitive in its portrayal of addiction, mental illness and suicide; even so, trigger warnings might have demonstrated an understanding that no two viewers will experience a film in the same way. It is baffling why trigger warnings have become such a heated topic. At its most basic, the concept is to warn viewers of any potentially upsetting content. The path to recovery from trauma is never linear, and the smallest and seemingly most insignificant thing can be enough to set you back. Originating on sites such as Tumblr, trigger warnings were a well-intentioned indication that distressing topics \u2013 sexual harassment, rape, abuse \u2013 were to be addressed. There is an argument that because films have classifications, there is no need for trigger warnings. However, classifications aren\u2019t specific enough: \u201cviolence\u201d covers all manner of sins; rape comes under a generalised category of \u201csexual violence\u201d. Trigger warnings further help viewers decide whether they want to see the film. It\u2019s arguable that trigger warnings are in effect spoiler alerts. As a frequent cinemagoer, I want to experience a film without prior knowledge or preconceptions. But is a little trigger warning really going to spoil a trip to the cinema? It\u2019s ironic that critics of trigger warnings often come across whinier than those they attack. Is your personal viewing experience so precious that you can\u2019t consider the mental health of your fellow audience members? Art has always been a space to discuss social issues. But for too long they have been exempt from the change and progress demanded from other parts of society. By defending creative freedom and freedom of speech, critics of trigger warnings champion the rights of the creator over those of their audiences, and the gap between the intention of a film and its effect is often forgotten. The rape-revenge film Elle, for example, might be intended as a critique of patriarchal sexual violence, but its graphic scenes are arresting at best, triggering at worst. It\u2019s not that these films shouldn\u2019t be made, just that it is the responsibility of the industry that they should be prefaced with appropriate warnings. Trigger warnings are about being considerate of audiences. Who\u2019s more \u201csnowflake\u201d: younger audiences expecting compassion or older ones \u2013 who ought to know better \u2013 complaining their movie has been spoiled?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
