What would she would have made of the procession of tourists posing for photographs next to the shop\u2019s lifesize cardboard cutouts of Harry and Meghan? \u201cEverybody\u2019s taking pictures,\u201d says Derek Prime, 74, who has worked at the shop since Charles and Diana\u2019s wedding in 1981. \u201cIt\u2019s very popular. Some people have even asked if they can buy one. I say I can get you one for \u00a350 or \u00a360. They may want one for a garden party or their royal memorabilia collection.\u201d The sun was shining as the final countdown to 19 May began in earnest this week. Meghan Markle\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, 61, and father, Thomas Markle Sr, 73, are reportedly en route from the US. The American actor is, presumably, having final dress fittings surrounded by her transatlantic friends. Part of the route the newlyweds will take on their procession by carriage from St George\u2019s chapel through Windsor has been freshly resurfaced. Media stands have sprung up along it to capture the couple trotting out of the castle and around the block before returning to granny\u2019s 13-acre back garden. On the Long Walk, journalists will be offered an unimpeded view of the carriage on its run-up to the castle. About 5,000 media representatives have been accredited, from organisations including 79 international networks and 46 US affiliates. So, with an estimated 100,000 people expected to descend on the town for the event, perhaps the nearest most will get to the couple is standing by the cardboard cut out. Local businesses are used to royal ceremony and adept at cashing in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plates in two different sizes,\u201d says Prime, pulling out a teddy bear in a royal wedding jumper from the window display. \u201cSoft toys. Mugs \u2013 that\u2019s the best seller.\u201d There are rows of \u00a312.99 mugs, boasting 24ct gold gilding. \u201cWe had 300 mugs go just like that. We\u2019ve another 1,000 in but they\u2019re going down fast.\u201d He is especially keen to offload Harry and Meghan postcards. \u201cIt\u2019s the engagement picture, you see. So we\u2019ll have to get rid of those quick before the next ones with the wedding picture come in.\u201d Visitors to Windsor on the day are urged to travel early. There will be a queuing system operating at railway stations and strict security measures in town. For those with deep pockets, one hotel still had a handful of exclusive suites overlooking Windsor high street. For \u00a31,995 for two nights\u2019 minimum stay, guests will enjoy a front-row seat overlooking the procession. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of an historic moment,\u201d says Phil Lewis, the hotel\u2019s general manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
