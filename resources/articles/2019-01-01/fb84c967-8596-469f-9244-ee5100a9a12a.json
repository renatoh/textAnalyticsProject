Liverpool endured and enjoyed one of those days against Crystal Palace when their manager\u2019s fist-pumping celebrations resurfaced long after he left the Anfield pitch to reinforce the point he is understandably averse to say. The countdown is under way. Liverpool did not perform like title favourites against Roy Hodgson\u2019s dangerous side, who scored as many goals as 10 previous visiting teams to Anfield combined this season yet departed ruing their lack of points, fortune and goalkeeping options. The nature of Liverpool\u2019s 19th victory in 23 league outings, a truly outstanding return, will not have been lost on Pep Guardiola, however. The single-minded pursuit of three more invaluable points, the breaks and the composure shown at 0-1 and 2-2 were not lost on Klopp either. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many ways there are to win a football game but we had pretty much a few of them already,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cI know we are a really good football team but that is not enough. It is really not enough to be a good or a fantastic or even a world-class football team because we are playing in a competition with a couple of world-class football teams and hundreds of fantastic football teams. We have to make sure that we just fight in each game like it\u2019s the last game and the boys did that. I\u2019m completely fine with 4-3.\u201d Klopp\u2019s team are in the phase of eking out victory by any means necessary and demonstrated again on Saturday how adept they are at it. Liverpool were reduced to 10 men in the 89th minute when James Milner was dismissed for a second bookable offence on his tormentor-in-chief, Wilfried Zaha. Makeshifts for the makeshift right-back arrived in the unlikely forms of Xherdan Shaqiri and Roberto Firmino, the latter eventually getting the job and an ear-bashing from Klopp for instinctively joining an attack at 3-2. \u201cWe had to react pretty quick and Bobby was a centre-half when he started playing, I remembered that at least, but of course it\u2019s difficult,\u201d his manager explained. \u201cWe had to defend Zaha with two or three players anyway and Bobby is a very smart player. In the moment when he was involved in the counterattack I thought \u2018My God\u2019 but that\u2019s what happens with a lack of oxygen, you do things you wouldn\u2019t normally do, but that\u2019s his desire and I loved that. He\u2019s always involved in pretty much everything and in that moment I had to shout \u2018You are now right full-back\u2019. In the end we defended with big heart and not with the best organisation.\u201d Rafa Camacho, an 18-year-old winger by trade, finished the game as Liverpool\u2019s right-back. The teenager rewarded Klopp\u2019s decision to reject a loan offer from Sporting Lisbon for his services this month with a perfectly executed tackle on Zaha inside the area in the final second. Asked for his thoughts on Camacho\u2019s contribution Klopp punched the air in celebration, having done likewise in front of the Kop following the final whistle. \u201cI told him immediately after the game that he\u2019d already made the most important challenge of his life,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he really got it \u2013 he looked at me like; \u2018What is he talking about?\u2019 \u2013 but it was really massive.\u201d Fortune favoured Liverpool with their first two goals, deflections aiding Mohamed Salah\u2019s improvised equaliser and Firmino\u2019s finish; a dreadful mistake by Juli\u00e1n Speroni, the stand-in keeper, gave Liverpool the third and Palace claims for handball by Andy Robertson in the build-up to Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s fourth were ignored by the referee, Jon Moss. But there was more to the crucial third goal than a 39-year-old\u2019s error. \u201cWe used Zaha\u2019s position for our offensive moments,\u201d Klopp explained. \u201cThat is the risk you take. Milly was most of the time behind his back and the third goal was like this \u2013 a chip over Zaha and Milly went in and set up the goal.\u201d Klopp will take advantage of an 11-day break before Liverpool\u2019s next game by taking his squad to a warm-weather training camp in Dubai. His options at right-back are unlikely to improve against Leicester with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez injured, Milner suspended and Fabinho damaging his hamstring against Palace. Klopp is not expected to seek reinforcements for what he hopes will be a one-game problem. The Liverpool manager admitted: \u201cI can imagine what people think about this situation but you have to make decisions in moments when decisions are on the table. That\u2019s why Clyney (Nathaniel Clyne) is not here any more. In that moment we had plenty of options and now we don\u2019t have them. Trent got an injury and it\u2019s serious but not that serious. He will be back early but I don\u2019t know if early enough for the next game. Maybe the game after. \u201cTell me a player who can play right-back and other positions as well better than our boys like Rafa can do? By the way, after training Ki-Jana [Hoever] has a little injury as well, not too serious and he\u2019s probably back for the Leicester game, but these things happen. Crystal Palace, of course, had three goalkeepers and all is fine and then the next moment you stand there with one. Do you buy another goalkeeper? I\u2019m not sure. We have to use the resources we have already and that is what we try.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
