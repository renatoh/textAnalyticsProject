The elite director of rugby is expected to become England manager in a shake-up of the team structure that will be considered by the Rugby Football Union's management board next month, and his role will reflect his increased influence as the World Cup progressed in France. Andrew attached himself closely to the squad after the South Africa defeat, regularly attending media conferences and effectively bolstering the head coach Brian Ashton. The chief concern of the players was not Ashton's vision of how the game should be played but that he was not exerting his authority as head coach. Among the complaints made by players in the second week of the tournament was that the forwards coach, John Wells, was having too great a say in selection and that Ashton needed to be more assertive. The players will be contacted as part of the review of the tournament which will recommend whether Ashton should be offered a new contract, whether the management team which has been in place for the past year should remain and whether a manager - likely to be Andrew - should be appointed to oversee selection and the specialist coaches and front up to the media. The England management and players had a four-hour meeting after the South Africa thrashing and the upshot was a change in training methods, a tweak in the style of play to inject a measure of continuity and greater consistency in selection. The turnaround was immediate and England, who at that stage were 279-1 to win the World Cup on Betfair, went on to become the most unlikely finalists in the history of the tournament. Andrew took a more hands-on role after the group game against South Africa, particularly with the media before matches; selection became more consistent and Ashton grew in authority. \"I think a problem was that Brian had been part of the coaching team under Andy Robinson with John Wells and Mike Ford,\" said one player. \"The three remained when Andy left and, although Brian was appointed head coach, he was a less forceful character than the other two, with whom he had been an equal. We just wanted him to lead the way.\" The former RFU councillor and England prop Jeff Probyn has called for Ashton to be sacked because England reached the final only after the players had wrested control of the campaign from the coaches, and the head coach has not received ringing endorsements from his players, with the exception of the captain Phil Vickery, since the squad returned from France. Andy Gomarsall, who went to France as a back-up scrum-half and ended up playing a pivotal role in England's campaign, said the players' intervention was crucial. \"Things were not working after the first couple of weeks and we [the players] had to change it. When you are on the field it is the players, not the coaches, who are calling the shots. The players had every right to speak up and it worked.\" Andrew, like the former head coach Sir Clive Woodward, believes planning for the 2011 World Cup should start now, but Ashton took a contrary view this week. \"A World Cup is not about what you have done in the previous three years, it is what you do for the seven weeks you are there,\" he said. \"It was a totally different experience from that I had expected: you live a day-to-day existence, not on the back of long-term planning. It's what happens when you get to the tournament that counts. I do not think there is a blueprint for success.\" England were the exception among the semi-finalists, having stumbled into the last four. France, Argentina and South Africa had all prepared assiduously for the World Cup over the previous four years. \"Planning is absolutely essential,\" said Jake White, who coached the Springboks to victory. \"Otherwise you are leaving things to chance and it is hard then to control your own destiny. From the first day I took the job, I told the players that everything was going to be geared to winning the World Cup. That meant identifying the best players and settling on combinations. \"You win World Cups through experience: the knockout stage is so hard because the games all come down to who deals best with pressure.\" White and the former Wasps director of rugby, Warren Gatland, have been linked with England, but the RFU is keen to retain Ashton, tweaking the set-up to suit his strengths. Bringing in an outsider would cost a considerable amount of money and the union believes Andrew has the time to combine the role of manager, driving selection, with his other elite duties. Andrew is already above Ashton and the move would not amount to a demotion for the head coach. As White said: \"At this level it is about 20% coaching and 80% selection.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
