Yet it\u2019s been capably produced: writer-director Charles Barker may cleave to a dusty old slasher-pic template but he hustles everybody briskly between levels, sending his industrious design team ahead of him to redress a presumably limited number of sets. If it\u2019s far from bleeding edge \u2013 within days, it\u2019ll look as dated as Tron and The Lawnmower Man do today \u2013 it\u2019s a modest upgrade on all those killer-website movies that popped up a decade ago, keeping us at least semi-interested as to who stands and falls.
