The scheme, run by the Department for International Development, is for young people who would not normally have the chance to work in a developing country. How would you describe the experience? Just amazing. It opened my eyes to another culture and another way of life. How did you find out about Platform2? Through my college. After filling out a form, I was invited for interview. It was informal. They asked me what I would miss most and how I would cope being away for 10 weeks. I coped fine, it was a culture shock at first but I settled in really quickly. What were your expectations of Ghana? Before we arrived we were warned about bad facilities. I was surprised that the house we were staying in was OK, it had flushing toilets and everything. The people were also very friendly and welcoming. What activities did you take part in? We worked with the local community, with around seven to 10 people, and were involved in teaching at schools, mountain tours, GPS mapping and painting. Is there a lack of awareness in the UK when it comes to Africa? It's completely different from what we see on TV; the people were so calm, and even though they don't have much in terms of luxuries, they are so happy. Are you planning anything related? I'm planning to go to India next, to volunteer with a charity. I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't taken part in this scheme. To whom would you recommend Platform2? Anyone open minded, as they will have to work with people who may be completely different to them. You have to be independent to leave your family."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
