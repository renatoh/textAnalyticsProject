G2 page 10, yesterday, that everyone over the age of 55 is to be offered a colonoscopy. Instead, the Department of Health plans to start offering people in their 60s a test to detect blood in stools from April next year. This programme is expected to reduce deaths from bowel cancer by 15% in the population invited for screening. A photograph accompanying the article was not in fact of a patient undergoing a colonoscopy. An erroneous caption was supplied by the picture agency. Information about Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, co-chairmen of Working Title Films, was accidentally reversed in a panel accompanying an interview with the two men, The producers, page 32, April 16. Tim Bevan is a governor of the National Film and Television School, and Eric Fellner is a governor of the British Film Institute, not the other way around. Simon Cumbers, the cameraman who was killed in an attack in Saudi Arabia last year that also injured the BBC correspondent Frank Gardner, was Irish, not British as we said in a subheading (The man who would not die, G2 page 2, yesterday). The Help! food column on April 6 had a recipe for lemon marmalade which suffered from an important omission - quantities (G2, page 9). They are: 1kg unwaxed lemons, 2kg granulated sugar, 2 litres water. \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.
