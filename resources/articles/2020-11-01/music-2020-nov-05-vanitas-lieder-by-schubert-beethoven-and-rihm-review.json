Their performance included the premiere of Wolfgang Rihm\u2019s Vermischter Traum, settings of the German baroque poet and dramatist Andreas Gryphius, which are dedicated to Nigl. The sequence is framed by groups of Schubert songs \u2013 a mix of familiar numbers such as Die Forelle, An die Musik and Wandrers Nachtlied, with less well-known late songs \u2013 and precedes Rihm\u2019s cycle with Beethoven\u2019s An die ferne Geliebte. The Gryphius songs were the first work Rihm completed while recovering from a serious illness that had brought a temporary halt to the flood of music he had produced over the previous five decades. Extracts from three sonnets provide the material for the seven songs; the mostly short texts dwell upon the transience of life, though they don\u2019t include anything from Gryphius\u2019s most famous poem, All Is Vanity, which provides the title for the disc. Rihm\u2019s sinuous settings seem close to the world of early Schoenberg or Berg, constantly flirting with tonality as the piano provides a densely chromatic backdrop, and sometimes rising to fierce, angry climaxes. Nigl\u2019s performance is beautifully controlled, suave almost; his soft-grained voice wraps itself easily around Rihm\u2019s smoothly contoured vocal lines. Pashchenko plays a modern Steinway for Vermischter Traum, but opts for a fortepiano, a modern copy of an 1819 Graf instrument, for Schubert and Beethoven. There\u2019s an easy familiarity about their Schubert performances, an almost private intimacy in which nothing is overstated, but the Beethoven cycle never quite catches fire; some distinctly slow tempi, especially in the first song, don\u2019t help. As a whole, though, it\u2019s a thoughtful, rewarding collection. This week\u2019s other pick Erinnerung, Christiane Karg\u2019s first solo disc for Harmonia Mundi, is devoted to Mahler. Partnered by Malcolm Martineau, her selection includes the five R\u00fcckert Lieder, but otherwise focuses on early songs, with selections from Des Knaben Wunderhorn and the Lieder und Ges\u00e4nge aus der Jugendzeit. Karg\u2019s clear, bright soprano is better suited to the more pictorial Wunderhorn settings than to some of the more inward-looking R\u00fcckert songs, but her singing is always acutely sensitive, and she ends the disc with a fascinating novelty, two songs in which she is \u201caccompanied\u201d by Mahler himself, as recorded on piano rolls in 1910 and complete with some occasionally startling tempo changes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
