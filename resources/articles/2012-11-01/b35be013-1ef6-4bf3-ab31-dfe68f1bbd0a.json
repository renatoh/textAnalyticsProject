Even a few years ago it was a relatively simple choice between a compact and a digital SLR. Now there are smartphone cameras, compact system cameras, retro-style cameras, video cameras that shoot stills and cameras so tough you can take them swimming. So, with all these to choose from, how do you find the right camera for you? First it helps if you understand some of the jargon \u2026 Compact cameras offer you reasonable image quality at a price as low as \u00a350. For more money you can get full creative control \u2013 manual overrides \u2013 and better sensors and lenses. At the top end you could pay around \u00a32,600, which buys terrific image quality, great design and the convenience of a compact. Superzoom cameras are hugely popular now because they offer all-in-one convenience. Modern sensors and lens design have meant that for many users, one camera with a huge zoom lens in a very small package will be more than sufficient. Compact system cameras with interchangeable lenses were born a few years ago. Smaller than a digital SLR (because they do away with the mirror) but with a much larger sensor than most compacts, they give you some of the image-quality benefits of a digital SLR with, in most cases, a more straightforward user experience. The larger sensors tend to give good performance in low light and greater control over the depth of field. Digital SLRs still offer the best choice of lenses and the top-end models have better sensors than the other cameras I've chosen here. You've probably got the best chance of capturing fast action with a digital SLR and a good lens. Plus, high-end features are starting to find their way into the mid- to low-end models as manufacturers try to keep the format popular. With this in mind, ask yourself the following questions before reaching for your wallet ... How much do you want to spend? Factor in the cost of accessories: extra batteries, memory cards and cases. Bear in mind that there's no point buying a camera with interchangeable lenses if you only buy one lens, and your extra lenses need to be of sufficient quality to make full use of the camera's potential. How portable do you want your camera to be? For some people it's essential to have something they can carrywith them at all times, such as a smartphone camera. Improved sensor technology now means small cameras can do great things: they're better in low light, can shoot in fast bursts, capture colour well, and even shoot videos. What will you be shooting? Think about what you want to shoot before you buy. If you plan to shoot fast-moving objects you probably need an interchangeable lens camera with better autofocus tracking and high burst rates. Ditto if you want the shallow depth of field aesthetic. Do you need to upload images online instantly? The huge popularity of services such as Instagram, Facebook and YouTube means many users want a camera that can directly upload stills and video. Smartphones are the obvious answer, with the bonus of GPS allowing you to geotag your imagery, so people can see where it was taken. The iPhone currently dominates, thanks to its range of apps, but Samsung has just launched a compact camera running the Android operating system and with 3G/4G and Wi-Fi connectivity. Increasingly, cameras will run image-processing apps, just as smartphones do. Do you want to print your images? If you want a giant fine art print, you should probably be looking at a high-end digital SLR. If your maximum print is going to be 10x8 inches for a photo album, what matters more is good colour and the correct aesthetic. Even an iPhone shot can be printed fairly large if taken in good enough light. Do you need multiple lenses? Most photography enthusiasts do. But don't think you need an interchangeable lens camera to get great images. Sony has just launched the compact Cyber-shot RX1, which has a fixed lens, but should have great image quality thanks to its full-frame sensor \u2013 albeit for an eye-watering \u00a32,600. Bear in mind that lenses hold their value longer than cameras. Do you need to shoot video? Although most stills cameras now come with a video mode, they use a variety of formats \u2013 some of which are easier to work with than others \u2013 and almost all are trumped by dedicated video cameras when it comes to audio. At the budget end, you can get compacts with good audio but no manual override, which is fine for capturing random moments. Some compacts and smartphones also make it easy to upload clips. At the top end, there are digital SLRs such as the Canon EOS 5D mark III and the Panasonic GH3, which have a full range of manual controls and produce video so good some broadcasters use them for television. Both have a large sensor, which means they produce a more cinematic aesthetic than most video cameras. Do you need to shoot continuously? One of the major differentiators between models is still their battery life. If you're a heavy user, opt for something that won't require you to buy and carry too many extra batteries. Lastly, use online reviews and photography magazines to help you draw up a shortlist, but then go in to a camera shop and try those models out side by side for look and feel. And don't rule out buying secondhand; last year's models can often be found at bargain prices, leaving you more cash for added accessories \u2013 or even a trip away to try out your new toy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
