In recent years the band have explored the idiosyncrasies of songwriter Robert Wyatt and the jazz, classical and fusion splicings of US bandleader John Hollenbeck. Now it's the turn of the late \u00c1stor Piazzolla, whose dark love songs and glowering tangos have been arranged by revered composer-pianist Gil Goldstein. Typically for this band, the sound of an Argentinian bandone\u00f3n doesn't appear until halfway in (and then it's a sample from the late tango star Roberto di Filippo), and, though an old vocal recording by 1930s tango superstar Carlos Gardel opens the show, it's succeeded by orchestrations worthy of the Birth of the Cool band, the Pat Metheny Group or even Django Bates. The ensemble writing is packed with fascinating, fast-changing detail \u2013 high trumpets and purring trombones entwining with woodwind lines, Morricone-meets-free-improv impressionism on Libertango, and an 11-minute, slow-dancing medley of Soledad and Vuelvo Al Sur that eventually begins to sound like Gil Evans' Las Vegas Tango. It's almost excessively busy and eventful, but an interpretation of real vision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
