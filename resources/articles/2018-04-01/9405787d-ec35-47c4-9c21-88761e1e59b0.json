As the project spirals into a bitter court battle and reality dawns that it\u2019s running well behind schedule and over budget, the relationship between the New South Wales government and its main contractor, Spanish-based Acciona has become increasingly poisonous. Last week the stakes ratcheted up as Acciona launched a $1.1bn lawsuit against the state\u2019s lead transport agency, Transport for NSW, alleging \u201cmisleading or deceptive conduct\u201d in the lead-up to it signing a contract in 2014 to design and build the project. While Acciona says it is determined to finish the project, it is going to be a year late and undoubtedly over budget. It\u2019s now a question of who will bear the cost overruns. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning This is the ultimate disaster for the Berejiklian government, which had planned to have the first trams rolling through Sydney\u2019s Eastern suburbs and CBD by March 2019 \u2013 just a few weeks before it faced the electorate. Together with parts of the Westconnex motorway project, also scheduled to open in March 2019, it was to have been a visible symbol of Berejiklian\u2019s pitch for re-election: that her government has rebuilt NSW \u2013 on time and on budget. All the angst over the privatisations that have funded it \u2013 the sale of the state\u2019s electricity networks, its land titles office and several landmark sandstone buildings \u2013 would be forgotten in the euphoria of a city that actually had a working public transport system. Instead she will go to the polls with an increasingly surly public wondering when it will be possible to walk through the CBD without having to dodge a forest of barricades or negotiate street closures. The marginal seat of Coogee (2.9%) will be at risk as voters in beachside suburbs tire of roadworks that leave them sitting in traffic jams. If the M5 East widening runs late too, she will have voters in south-west Sydney, where there are many more marginal seats, baying for her blood. Building a rail line along George Street, Australia\u2019s oldest street, was always going to be difficult, not just because of city traffic, but because of what lurked below: two and a half centuries of pipes, conduits and cables, some of which were documented and some of which were not. It was always one of the key risks of the project. So Transport for NSW and the contractor came up with a process to identify what needed to be done. The sub-contractor claims Transport for NSW led it to believe power company Ausgrid had agreed to a plan to deal with its utilities under the 12.5km route. It had not. Acciona says Transport for NSW had prevented it from dealing directly with Ausgrid and instead came up with \u201c iterative workshops\u201d attended by Acciona and Transport for NSW that developed \u201cSchedule F8\u201d \u2013 a massive spreadsheet which documented agreement on what was to happen on infrastructure on all but a handful of sites. But no sooner had the consortium closed the deal in February 2015, than Acciona, it says, received a document from Ausgrid, with much more extensive requirements that amounted to a change in scope on the project. It included requirements like additional spare conduits and enlarging pits for cables as well as many more relocations of services. This, it says, has led to weeks of work at key intersections, sending the project way off schedule. But the government is hitting back. It has yet to lodge its defence, but in the meantime the battle is being fought in the public square. On Wednesday the Daily Telegraph was given a \u201csensitive government briefing note\u201d dated the same day, which told the NSW minister for transport and infrastructure, Andrew Constance, that the company was now working on a March 2020 operational date. The note blamed the delays on \u201cthe level of productivity\u201d and the Telegraph quoted unnamed government officials citing unnamed workers on the project who \u201cwere dobbing in the Spanish contractor Acciona for its go-slow tactics\u201d. One worker had reported that there were \u201cconstant delays on material and equipment deliberately done by our supervisors\u201d, the Telegraph said. Constance was said to be \u201cfurious\u201d and Transport for NSW officials are demanding that the company recommit to finish the project in 2019. Constance has chided Acciona for being on a \u201cgo-slow\u201d and raised concerns about the \u201cpoor quality\u201d of its work, \u201cnumerous site safety incidents\u201d, and \u201cever-dwindling numbers of workers\u201d. The idea that Acciona is deliberately going slow makes very little sense \u2013 except as a rhetorical flourish in this increasingly bitter fight. In 2014, when Berejiklian as transport minister signed the contract, she made much of the penalties that the ALTRAC consortium would pay for not releasing sites on time. Acciona is now seeking compensation for these penalties as part of its claim. It\u2019s also worth looking back at what the NSW auditor general, Margaret Crawford, said about the light rail project in November 2016. Crawford warned that Transport for NSW \u201cdid not effectively plan and procure the CBD and South East Light Rail (CSELR) project to achieve best value for money\u201d. The project\u2019s initial cost of $1.6bn had increased by $549m to $2.1bn when Transport signed the main works public private partnership contract in December 2014. \u201cThe established assurance framework provided that Transport for NSW undertake the assurance reviews of the project. However, this approach did not provide the independent assurance required for such a major infrastructure project,\u201d the audit found. In addition, the planning and governance arrangements skipped important assurance steps. \u201cTight timeframes meant planning was inadequate and normal governance systems were not initially in place,\u201d the auditor said. \u201cAbove all, it did not finalise key third party agreements that affected the design and scope of works before issuing tenders and signing the major public private partnership contract. This has increased the project\u2019s complexity and risks, and reduced value for money,\u201d Ms Crawford said. Some see the current chaos on the streets of Sydney as the legacy of a rushed process designed to deliver an outcome by a politically motivated deadline. The most important outcome now from the public\u2019s perspective is that the project is delivered as economically and as smoothly as possible \u2013 and preferably without lawyers adding to the cost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
