This time, we\u2019re asking for your images on the theme of play. Maybe you have a sporting interpretation, or perhaps for you the word takes on a theatrical meaning? Whichever it is, share your photos of what play means to you \u2013 and tell us about your image in the description box. The closing date is Thursday 14 January at 10 am. We\u2019ll publish our favourites in The New Review on Sunday 17 January and in a gallery on the Guardian site. You can share your \u2018play\u2019 pictures by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button on this article. You can also use the Guardian app and search for \u2018GuardianWitness assignments\u2019 \u2013 and if you add it to the homepage you can keep up with all our assignments.
