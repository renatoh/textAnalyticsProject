A judge overturned Walter Ogrod\u2019s conviction in the sexual assault and murder of four-year-old Barbara Jean Horn, his neighbor in Philadelphia, in July 1988. \u201cWe not only stole 28 years of your life,\u201d assistant district attorney Carrie Wood told Ogrod, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cWe threatened to execute you based on falsehoods.\u201d Ogrod, who was held at State Correctional Institution Phoenix in Skippack, had his charges reduced and was released on bail. Technically, he should face a new trial but prosecutors have said they will not pursue it. One of his lawyers, James Rollins, told reporters Ogrod\u2019s first stop would be a relative\u2019s backyard barbecue. \u201cHe was very pleased and relieved to be out of prison,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cHe is very tired.\u201d Ogrod, who was 23 when Barbara Jean was killed and is now 55, has autism. He confessed to the crime in 1992. At his first trial, in 1993, his attorneys argued the confession was coerced by detectives, while five eyewitnesses said a man seen putting on the street the TV box in which Barbara Jean\u2019s body was found did not look like Ogrod. That trial ended in an 11-1 verdict to acquit, and a mistrial. In 1996 Ogrod was convicted, on jailhouse hearsay, and sentenced to death. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, among US states Pennsylvania has the fifth-most inmates on death row, but has carried out only three executions since 1976. Ogrod protested his innocence from prison and his case attracted national attention. In 2018, CNN released a film, Snitch Work, an episode of the Susan Sarandon-narrated Death Row Stories which featured coverage by author Tom Lowenstein and the Philadelphia City Paper, an alternative weekly that closed in 2015. Also in 2018, as part of an initiative under district attorney Larry Krasner, a review of the case was announced. DNA testing carried out in January this year ruled definitively that Ogrod did not kill Barbara Jean. In April, Barbara Jean\u2019s mother, Sharon Fahy, said in a statement: \u201cThere is no question in my mind that Mr Ogrod is innocent and that he should be released from prison immediately. \u201cMy daughter is never coming home but I wanted justice for her, not simply a closed case with an innocent person in jail,\u201d Fahy wrote. \u201cTwo families have already been destroyed. Keeping Mr Ogrod in prison does nothing to accomplish my goal of bringing the person that killed my Barbara Jean to justice.\u201d A motion to overturn the conviction was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, in which Ogrod fell ill. He recovered but Friday\u2019s hearing was held remotely, via Zoom. Andrew Gallo, an attorney for Ogrod, said: \u201cUntil today, our society \u2013 our justice system \u2013 has failed Walter Ogrod and Barbara Jean\u2019s family.\u201d Wood told Fahy: \u201cThis office has not told you the truth about what happened to your little girl so many years ago. The truth is painful and terrible, but it is what you deserved to hear from this office and we did not do that. And I am so sorry.\u201d The truth, according to the DA\u2019s office in court documents filed earlier this year, is that Barbara Jean died of asphyxiation. In his confession, Ogrod said he beat her with a metal bar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
