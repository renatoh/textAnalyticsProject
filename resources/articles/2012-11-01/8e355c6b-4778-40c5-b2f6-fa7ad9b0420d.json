In August this year I moved house. Two weeks before I moved, I contacted Primus to ask them to move my supply to the new address, which they agreed to do. On 1 September, I received a bill including an amount of \u00a3116 for \"charges, credits and adjustments\", which I assume was for the reconnection to the new address. On 3 September, having heard nothing about the reconnection, I called Primus. I was told the broadband service could not be provided at the new address. Obviously I had to find another supplier, which I did. I therefore cancelled my direct debit with Primus. About two weeks later I got a voicemail from Primus saying they could supply the service after all, and that an engineer would be calling on 29 October. I emailed to explain why this was not acceptable. Since then an email stream has been continuing where they insist I pay an early termination fee of \u00a3125 for cancelling my contract. LH, Blakeney New Call Telecom, which owns the Primus brand, has appeared on this page before regarding a dispute over broadband provision (or lack thereof). In your case, it says: \"When processing a change of address, on our systems we have to terminate the service at the old address which automatically generates an early termination fee (ETF) if the customer is still in contract. Our provisioning team then waives this ETF before it hits the customer's account and then they place an order for the new line at the new property.\" On this occasion, it says, that charge \"slipped the net\" and was applied to your account. It has dropped the fee and closed your account. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
