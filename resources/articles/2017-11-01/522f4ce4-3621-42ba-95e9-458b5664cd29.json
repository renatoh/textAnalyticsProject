It\u2019s far from obvious that the swaggering Guilty apparently expresses the thoughts of a regretful Brexit voter (\u201cI\u2019m living in my worst fears / Begging you back through tears\u201d). Samuel L Jackson\u2019s opening monologue about revolution is far more direct than the subsequent title track\u2019s oblique apparent references to domestic violence. Owen Jones\u2019s rousing speech about the politics of hope leads only to the wishy-washy Kings and Queens. However, there\u2019s plenty of the big-voiced, Amy Winehouse/Lisa Stansfield-type pop that saw Faith\u2019s first three albums go double platinum. The John Legend duet I\u2019ll Be Gentle is trademark classy schmaltz and the Sia-penned Warrior addresses refugees on the vaguest terms. Nobody will storm parliament after hearing this, but Faith\u2019s heart\u2019s in the right place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
