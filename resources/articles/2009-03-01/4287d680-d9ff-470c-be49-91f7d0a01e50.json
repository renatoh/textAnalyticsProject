The deal also includes more lenient terms on an existing government investment in AIG preferred shares and a lower interest rate on a $60bn government credit line, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. AIG's board voted to approve the revised agreement on Sunday. It means the insurer, best known in Britain for its sponsorship of Manchester United, has had lifelines worth $180bn from the state. Peter Morici, Professor at the Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland said: \"AIG is insuring the losses of the banks\u2026 It's the other side of the banks' problems. Until the government does something to stop the losses, it's going to be pouring money into both AIG and the banks. This is just another band-aid. There's no amount of money that you can give [AIG], there are $2 trillion in losses out there. This is like giving them three buckets when there's a hole in the boat.\" Details of the additional bailout are expected to be revealed on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
