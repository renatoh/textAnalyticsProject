Brett Lee, the fastest bowler on the planet, is charging in to a crimson-uniformed left-handed batsman intent on carnage. Lee bowls, the batsman swings powerfully, connects, and in his mind sees yet another searing boundary. But Lee sticks out his right hand, and somehow the ball smacks into his palm close to his ear, reflex alone closing his fingers. It is a stunning unexpected catch. The camera homes in on the Australian's scrubbed-up Tintin face, and catches his eyes open wide in happy astonishment and then the single long-drawn-out expletive. He might have been decapitated. \"Well I didn't quite middle it,\" says Andy Blignaut, now in Hove, sitting on a bench in the frozen aftermath of Zimbabwe's last match before this Thursday's Test. \"But I hit it all right. I can tell you he had his eyes shut when he caught that ball. It was hard to believe and we both sort of looked at each other and grinned and uttered a few words.\" Blignaut trudged from the pitch, his dismissal preventing Zimbabwe from getting to a position from which they might have embarrassed the world champions. But 54 from 28 balls against that sort of bowling was a strong statement. Another half-century from 38 balls in the next game against Holland and he was away. Hove, though, is a world away from Bulawayo. It was windswept and bleak on Sunday as a stiff wind with a finger-numbing spring chill to it biffed in from the sea. Enthusiasm is hard to retain in such conditions, especially in a match already dead and buried, yet Heath Streak's side, mindful of their preparations, managed it. They are a noisy lot on the field, but the constant stream of encouragement keeps the bowlers going. Blignaut thrives on this. It is a reassurance to him that he is onside within the team once more, after he had taken a year out of the game two seasons ago, amid rumours of disaffection within the ranks of fellow players and administrators, to play polocrosse and try the catwalk as a bit of a giggle. So, besweatered against the cold, he ducked his head into the wind walking back to his bowling mark, and then strode in up the hill to hit the bat splice-jarringly hard. There was no greater satisfaction all match for the tourists than when the off stump of their erstwhile batsman Murray Goodwin, now captaining the opposition, Sussex, was sent tumbling back towards the keeper. At only 24, Blignaut (pronounced with a throat-clearing \"blick\" and a Yorkshire \"nowt\") has the capacity to become an eye-catching all-rounder of world stature in the manner of the South African Lance Klusener, the sort who make spectators sit up and pay attention. One former captain, Alistair Campbell, calls him \"the most exciting prospect to come out of Zimbabwe cricket\". Another, the recently retired Andy Flower, refers to him as \"thrilling\". Like Klusener he strikes the ball with immense power and a free swing of the bat, and bowls right arm with a hint of away swing, although in a more muscular manner than the South African's rather prissy, manufactured action. He may well be the fastest of the Zimbabwean pace attack. Unlike Klusener he is also a spectacularly good fielder. Yet he might have been lost to the game. After an exciting start to his international career a couple of years back, he gave cricket away in favour of the other activities. The rancour with authority and a sequence of niggling injuries caused him to reassess whether he wanted to play cricket at all. \"I decided that a short break would do me good,\" he says. So he went back to riding horses as he had been doing since his farming childhood, explored a few business ventures, generally had a good time and discovered that it was cricket in his blood after all. \"I simply didn't know if I wanted to play the game,\" he admits. \"That break proved very good for me because I realised I was missing my cricket and I got my hunger and passion back. I'd lost my enthusiasm but since I've been back I'm much happier.\" He signed a new contract with the Zimbabwean Cricket Union last November. Even if it is likely he will play a more prominent part in June's one-day series, he is keen to establish his Test credentials. At the moment he is still learning the art of Test cricket, with its disciplines, and it may be that his bowling rather than batting will take centre stage. Although he has spent time in the past around the fringes of the Warwickshire side, he, like most bowlers from the southern hemisphere when they come to England, has had trouble adjusting to the new fuller length needed. In the first county game against Worcestershire he was not alone in bowling short on a helpful pitch, which was more spectacular than effective. \"I'm getting more used to it now, though,\" he says. \"It is all about learning to adapt.\" In this he is enjoying the help of the former Australia fast bowler Rodney Hogg, who has just started working with Zimbabwe. \"Already he has pointed out a few things that we were slightly aware of - reinforcement really - such as the manner in which the ball comes out of the hand, tactics, where to bowl, and how to work out batters. These are all things we've talked about, but it is still early days.\" His batting, though, needs refinement to succeed consistently in the lower middle order. He is slightly bemused that he is presently batting at No9. \"Somehow I seem to be sliding down the order. I don't know what has happened. There I was at seven, then eight and now nine. But performances count and if I make more runs than the guys above me then they'll have to move me up, won't they?\" This, though, will demand a discipline to his batting which hitherto has been largely absent. He had had a bit of a stab at this during his short innings on Saturday and Sunday. \"Yeah,\" he says, \"concentration and patience, especially when the ball moves around.\" Then he stops, and glances up at the players' balcony where he suspects his team-mates may be earwigging. \"I still want to hit it, though.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
