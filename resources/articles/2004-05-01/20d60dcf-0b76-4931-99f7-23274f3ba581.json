The Spain midfielder Rub\u00e9n Baraja, a second-half substitute, put the match and the championship beyond doubt when he shot home in the final minute. Vicente had set Valencia on the way to the sixth title in their history with a 12th-minute drive. At the Bernabeu Stadium, Madrid were jeered on Saturday night as they fell to a 3-2 defeat by Real Mallorca, their third in sucession. Samuel Eto'o delivered two superb goals in the first half, Alejandro Campano adding the third with a clever free-kick. Francisco Pav\u00f3n had briefly brought Madrid level at 1-1 and Luis Figo also scored with a penalty after 50 minutes. But overall it was another poor display, and Ronaldo admitted: \"They have every right to jeer and whistle us.\" Barcelona lost for the first time in 18 games, succumbing 1-0 at lowly Celta Vigo, where the Brazilian Edu shot home just before the interval. In the Netherlands, Ajax clinched their 29th championship yesterday with a 2-0 win over NAC Breda before a jubilant 50,000 crowd at the Amsterdam ArenA. Wesley Sneijder and Zlatan Ibrahimovic settled it with first-half goals to start the celebrations for Ajax, who captured the title for the second time in three seasons after losing out to PSV Eindhoven last year. The order was now neatly reversed as Eindhoven finished runners-up after a 3-2 win over ADO Den Haag . Werder Bremen took the Bundesliga title for a fourth time with a convincing 3-1 win at second-placed Bayern Munich on Saturday. Werder were three ahead of the deposed champions after 35 minutes, one coming from the Brazilian striker Ailton, who scored his 27th goal in 32 league games. Internazionale's hopes of Champions League football next season rose when they beat Parma 1-0 at San Siro yesterday. Adriano's 62nd-minute goal against his former club put Inter in fourth place, a point ahead of the visitors. Milan , the champions, suffered only their second defeat this season, a 2-1 setback at Reggina , who escaped relegation. \u00b7 Atletico Madrid's owner and former president Jes\u00fas Gil, 71, was last night in a stable but serious condition in a Madrid hospital after suffering a stroke yesterday. A hospital spokesman said: \"Given his history of heart problems, we just hope that he evolves favourably.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
