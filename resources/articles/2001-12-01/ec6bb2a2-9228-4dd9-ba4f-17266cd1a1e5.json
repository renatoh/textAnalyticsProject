Following a major outbreak of bottle-throwing and a half-hour hold-up in play in Cleveland on Sunday there was a smaller reprise in New Orleans in the nationally televised Monday night game, which led to 13 arrests. Both incidents followed contentious refereeing decisions that may have severely damaged the home teams' hopes of making the Super Bowl in February. Only six were arrested in the Cleveland riot but witnesses called it \"the ugliest behaviour the NFL has seen in a long time\". One of the players on the visiting Jacksonville team, Jimmy Smith, said: \"I felt like I was starring in Saving Private Ryan or something.\" Carmen Policy, the Cleveland president, responded initially with a thoroughly un-correct shrug: \"I like the fact that our fans cared. The bottles are plastic. They don't carry much of a wallop.\" Twenty-four hours later he was forced to apologise: even plastic-bottle throwing goes deeply against the tradition that mayhem is strictly confined to the players. Anyway some of the bottles were full and came from a great height. The Cleveland Browns fans have a tradition of being boisterous, if rarely violent, and the trouble started in the area known as \"the Dawg Pound\", which outsiders contemplate with a shudder but is regarded with such affection locally that it was transplanted from the Browns' old stadium. The problem was a direct result of American football's troubled love affair with TV refereeing. The sport pioneered instant replay in 1986, then scrapped it in 1992 (the year cricket brought it in) because it wasted too much time. It was reintroduced in 1999; many team owners remain opposed to it. Under current rules coaches have two challenges to referees' rulings per game - except in the last two minutes, when the call has to be made by an official in the stands. However, replays can be used only if the referee responds before play resumes. On this occasion an inexperienced referee, Terry McAulay, failed to do so. The New Orleans incident, which was quickly contained, came after a straightforward decision that went against the home team, the Saints, in the last minute of a tight game. But the trouble looked to have a copycat element after the extensive TV coverage of events in Cleveland. Football writers are clear about the underlying cause. \"There'd be no problem if they stopped selling beer,\" said Ken Denlinger of the Washington Post. \"You wouldn't get many people throwing Diet Pepsi containers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
