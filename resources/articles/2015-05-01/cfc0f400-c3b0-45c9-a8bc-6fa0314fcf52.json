Audiard\u2019s film is the tale of a former fighter in the Sri Lankan civil war who seeks asylum in France by means of a fake family. Speaking after the ceremony, Audiard said that it was \u201cimportant to reflect\u201d on the current situation, although he wrote the script five years ago, \u201cwhen it wasn\u2019t so critical\u201d. \u201cWhat interested me was the position of someone different in society. How the people who sell us roses when we\u2019re sitting in a cafe live and where they come from. If it helps their situation, then so much the better.\u201d Audiard, 63, is a favourite at the festival. His film A Prophet, about a young French-Algerian man sentenced to six years in a French prison, took the Grand Prix, or runner-up award, five years ago. He competed subsequently with Rust and Bone. The decision to award him the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes\u2019s 68th edition was \u201cswift\u201d said Ethan Coen, who jointly chaired this year\u2019s jury with his brother, Joel. \u201cThis was a film about which everyone had a high level of excitement and enthusiasm.\u201d Juror Gulliermo del Toro brushed off suggestions of a political agenda in Dheepan\u2019s selection for the top prize, saying \u201cthe issue of immigration per se was not something we discussed\u201d. But Spanish actor and fellow juror Rossy de Palma did draw parallels between the film and \u201cthe people in the streets you see and wonder where they come from. People living in very difficult and precarious circumstances. [Dheepan] is real cinema and we feel deeply concerned by what\u2019s happening in the Mediterranean.\u201d It was a night of considerable surprises, with many favourites thwarted and the jury exhibiting eclectic taste, in part as a result of rules which mean they can only give one prize per film, and split just one award between two recipients. \u201cIt was a bit of a chess game,\u201d said Joel, whose 1991 movie Barton Fink took three major Cannes awards. Speaking after the ceremony, Carol director Todd Haynes \u2013 who picked up the best actress award for Rooney Mara in her absence \u2013 dismissed suggestions he was disappointed by the results given that his film had been tipped for the top prize and because Mara and Blanchett\u2019s performances are so interdependent. \u201cThe night of the premiere I\u2019ll never forget \u2026 I\u2019m so proud. Rooney has the quieter role but I have no doubt Cate will continue to get great praise.\u201d Canadian director and actor Xavier Dolan said the process of judging the films had served as a reminder about the lack of substantial roles for women. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take anything away [from the wins] but we did realise that there were very few leading ladies.\u201d This year\u2019s Grand Prix went to 38-year-old Hungarian director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes for his debut, Son of Saul, the Auschwitz-set story of a prisoner working as a Sonderkommando, guiding Jews into the gas chambers and then disposing of their bodies. Speaking after the ceremony, Nemes addressed the film\u2019s contemporary relevance. \u201cEurope is still haunted by the destruction of the European Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Hungary you can feel it. We have the record of 450,000 Jews, including 100,000 children, being deported in eight weeks.\u201d He wanted to make a film which would speak to a \u201cnew generation without access to survivors\u201d, he said, adding that its success at Cannes encouraged him to hope it would be seen in \u201cas many nations and cultures as possible\u201d. Jury members confessed themselves stunned by the film, with Dolan reporting that \u201ca very long moment of reflection and silence\u201d followed the screening, while Sienna Miller said it was the most successful film she\u2019d ever seen about the Holocaust: \u201cIt shook me very deeply.\u201d Such reaction was his intention, said Nemes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a historical drama but to plunge the spectator into a unique experience. I wanted to leave a lot to the imagination so they could understand something I couldn\u2019t show.\u201d Elsewhere among the prizes, bookies\u2019 favourite The Lobster, in which Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz are among those who play single people who must find a mate in 45 days or be turned into wild animals, went home with the Prix du Jury (third prize). Its Greek director, Yorgos Lanthimos, said he had spent time considering how the jury might react to it. \u201cThey obviously have very specific tastes. Any film that tries to do certain things differently will divide people. Automatically your mind wonders whether the Coens will like it. You\u2019re stressed and humbled.\u201d French actor Vincent Lindon also paid tribute to the chairmen, saying that simply knowing they had seen his movie was reward enough \u2013 though he added he was \u201ccrazy with joy and deeply moved\u201d to win the best actor award (for his role as a security guard in St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9\u2019s The Measure of a Man). Picking up his first major honour at the age of 55, the actor beat much-fancied contenders Michael Caine (in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s Youth) and Tim Roth, who plays a traumatised palliative care nurse in bleak drama Chronic. That film did take the best screenplay prize for its writer and director Michel Franco, who called the Coens \u201cmy heroes\u201d and paid tribute to Roth, who chaired the Un Certain Regard jury which rewarded his previous film, After Lucia, three years ago. The pair forged a plan to work together at the after-party. \u201cYou should always treat festivals as a way of getting employment,\u201d said an ebullient Roth, calling himself Franco\u2019s \u201cMum, when Mum can\u2019t be around\u201d. Franco used the platform of the press conference to do what he\u2019d forgotten in the ceremony: dedicate the prize to his grandmother, whose suffering after a stroke inspired the movie. Juror Jake Gyllenhaal praised the director\u2019s subtlety and bravery in handling \u201cvery complicated\u201d subject matter. \u201cThe concept of assisted suicide is an interesting one, which should be brought into the conversation.\u201d The Camera d\u2019Or for best first film went to C\u00e9sar Augusto Acevedo for Land and Shade. The Colombian director concluded his speech by leading the audience in singing Happy Birthday to the Lobster and Tale of Tales actor John C Reilly, who had presented him with the award. Earlier in the ceremony, Reilly performed an inexplicable Dixieland version of Just a Gigolo. Best director went to Taiwanese film-maker Hou Hsiao-hsien, whose martial arts epic The Assassin marks his return to cinema after an eight-year absence. Jane Birkin presented the honorary Palme d\u2019Or to veteran director Agnes Varda, now 86, who made an emotional tribute to her late husband, the film-maker Jacques Demy, who died 25 years ago. Critics are divided over the overall quality of this year\u2019s festival. The programme of the artistic director, Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, was at pains to promote homegrown talent, with nine of the 19 competition films either French productions or co-productions and US and UK directors thin on the ground. The three Italian films in competition \u2013 including new movies from Nanni Moretti and Matteo Garrone \u2013 all failed to score an award, as did Justin Kurzel\u2019s stylish adaptation of Macbeth starring Michael Fassbender. Although there has been an absence of high-profile turkeys such as last year\u2019s opener, Grace of Monaco, the number of flat-out classics was also felt to be lower. Last year\u2019s festival saw the premieres of Leviathan, Winter Sleep, Mr Turner, Jimmy\u2019s Hall, Foxcatcher, Wild Tales, Clouds of Sils Maria, Mommy and Two Days, One Night. The sense on the Croisette is that fewer of this year\u2019s crop are likely to progress either to Oscar contention, or into the cinematic canon. Instead, the headlines were dominated by the midnight screening of Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s 3D sex movie Love and by \u201cflatgate\u201d, which saw the festival under attack after security guards banned a number of women \u2013 including an amputee \u2013 from premieres for not wearing high heels. But the jury professed themselves energised by the experience. Dolan, whose new movie begins shooting in 24 hours, said the process had been unique. \u201cNever have I discussed movies with such generosity and emotion. It has transformed me as a human being reflecting on what movies are. I somehow feel like a better person.\u201d Joel Coen echoed the sentiment, saying that \u201can experience this intense changes your life\u201d, while de Palma expressed her enthusiasm for \u201cmaking love to cinema all day\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
