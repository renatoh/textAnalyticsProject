Catt was applauded around the field, and a few other team-mates also playing in their final matches were handed awards. Danie Coetzee, their departing Springbok hooker, was in tears. He had scored London Irish's only try of the day \u2013 and it was his first for the club. But these were notes of emotion on a day dominated comfortably by the visitors. Northampton had looked for a long time as if they were cruising for a home semi-final this season, but in the end they needed to win this last game of the regular season to get it because Saracens are waxing strongly. Sarries will see nothing here to worry them unduly when they travel to Franklin's Gardens for that semi-final, however. This was a job done well enough by the Saints, three tries nicely taken, two from Jon Clarke and one by Chris Ashton, but Northampton played within themselves in an uninspiring game. London Irish's teamsheet by the end read like a who's who of their academy. Catt's presence did wonders for the average age of the side that finished. \"I felt very comfortable out there,\" the 38-year-old said. \"I still felt I had the drive to do it. But being a coach doesn't give me time to train, and I can't preach 'no mistakes' if I'm making them myself. \"I've had a few lows over my career and numerous highs, but I've just carried on doing exactly what I've been doing since I was 15. And that's to work hard. \"Winning the World Cup [in 2003], the years at Bath, the people I've met and the players I've played with and against \u2014 I've been very fortunate. We had great times in the amateur days \u2014 we got drunk three times a week, played rugby and won. Rugby's changed, but that's just life. You look at any business, it's changed as well. \"Rugby is very healthy now. You saw the crowd today. And you have these young guys coming into the game \u2014 they're a hell of a skilful lot. They're passionate about the game, and that's what you want.\" The passion does not stop here, either. Northampton cannot wait to get their teeth into Saracens on Sunday. They did not appreciate the way Sarries celebrated their victory at Franklin's Gardens two weeks ago. \"That hurt,\" said Jim Mallinder, Northampton's director of rugby, \"to hear them singing in the changing rooms as if they'd won the league. You take motivation from a lot of things \u2026\" That game is much more likely to linger in the memory.
