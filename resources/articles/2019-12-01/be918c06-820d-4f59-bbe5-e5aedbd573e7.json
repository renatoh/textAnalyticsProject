Ljungberg earned his first win as Arsenal\u2019s interim coach after a nine-minute burst that will force West Ham to reconsider Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s position as manager. Pellegrini\u2019s side led at half-time thanks to a goal from Angelo Ogbonna but the visitors secured their first victory in 10 matches thanks to strikes from Gabriel Martinelli, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \u201cArsenal is a big football club,\u201d Ljungberg said. \u201cWe have to win football games. I have been able to sense the pressure they are under. It\u2019s been tough for them. You\u2019ve felt it and seen it in games. Today it lifted a bit and we started to play good football. The main thing is we can\u2019t get carried away. We have a lot to work on.\u201d Ljungberg was installed on a temporary basis after Unai Emery was fired last month and he was relieved to gain his first victory at the third time of asking. Arsenal were low on confidence after last Thursday\u2019s abysmal home defeat by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion but West Ham were taken apart in the second half. \u201cThe players did amazingly,\u201d Ljungberg said. \u201cIn the first half we were slow, we were lethargic, we didn\u2019t run. In my opinion that comes from the players being low. It was amazing to see for me. You see West Ham getting a bit tired around the 60th minute and we sliced them open.\u201d Ljungberg praised Martinelli after the 18-year-old marked his first Premier League start with his first goal at this level and he was also delighted to see P\u00e9p\u00e9 justify his \u00a372m fee with a stunning goal and an assist for Aubameyang. \u201cPeople always ask me about Nico,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople put pressure on him. He worked really hard, offensively and defensively. I\u2019m pleased for him. He will fall asleep with a smile on his face.\u201d West Ham lie a point above the bottom three after losing seven of their last nine matches. Pellegrini admitted his side conceded easy goals and were lacking confidence. \u201cI am worried because in the last five games here at home we have just one draw,\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager said. \u201cWe must be more consistent and more solid and try to finish with more quality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
