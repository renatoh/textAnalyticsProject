In the blue corner will be Bath\u2019s irresistible attack, opposite the immovable object that is Saracens\u2019 illustrious \u201cwolf-pack\u201d defence. On this scintillating evidence it is Sarries who should be the more concerned in the buildup. It was not only the seven tries Bath scored against a Leicester side who endured a razor-sharp lesson in top-class finishing. Even more ominous was the rising self-belief it has given Mike Ford\u2019s team before their first grand final since 2004. All season they have been granted a licence to thrill and it is not about to be withdrawn for the big occasion. Rising above the constricting fear of failure will remain at the core of Bath\u2019s philosophy, as neatly summarised by their big wing Matt Banahan: \u201cThe coaches have given every player belief in what we can do. A lot of teams will only attack from the halfway line but we can attack from our own five-metre line. There\u2019s nothing we\u2019re doing out there that\u2019s risky. We\u2019re just doing basic things well.\u201d Ford and his staff deserve serious credit for what is unfolding. Although Banahan scored a hat-trick of glorious tries, the key statistic was that Bath registered seven tries in eight visits to Leicester\u2019s 22 despite enjoying only 35% possession and 29% territory. \u201cIt\u2019s about having the courage to play when they kick the ball to you,\u201d Ford said. \u201cSeventy-five per cent of our training is from there. \u201cSaracens will know what\u2019s coming. They\u2019re an excellent kick-chase side who challenge the ruck and if you play at the wrong time they\u2019ll turn you over. Owen [Farrell] will kick his goals and they\u2019ve got a couple of fantastic wingers but at the same time I\u2019d be devastated if we don\u2019t take opportunities when they\u2019re on. We make our decision on attack on what the defence do. If Saracens have 13 or 14 in the front line we\u2019ll kick it, if they haven\u2019t we\u2019ll probably run it. It\u2019s quite simple really.\u201d Previous experience has also taught Ford not to be too cute in a final week. \u201cA long time ago I got Oldham RL to a grand final and changed things training-wise. I\u2019ve learned my lesson. We kicked the ball away too much in the first 20 minutes of the second half but otherwise we won\u2019t change anything. Sam [Burgess] said that two years ago with South Sydney they got it wrong [in the play-offs] by training too long. This year, when they won it, they kept training short and intense. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d As well as wondering aloud how both finalists\u2019 squads fit inside the existing salary cap, neutrals will have another opportunity to judge whether the outstanding George Ford, Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph are the best midfield trio available to England. Ford Sr needs no convincing. \u201cPeople tell me they\u2019re too small or haven\u2019t got the power but you could pick a powerful winger and let him be the back-line crusher? Or go to six-man lineouts? You have to play a gameplan that suits them.\u201d At least Leicester were forewarned about this Tiger trap, having lost 45-0 on the same ground in September. Five missed penalties and another broken ankle for the luckless Niall Morris did not help but, despite briefly being reduced to 13 men, Bath\u2019s fluency of movement, with Anthony Watson in electric mood, was from a different galaxy. Richard Cockerill, the Tigers\u2019 director of rugby, acknowledged Leicester needed to \u201cimprove and evolve\u201d but insisted they would bounce back next season even without the departing Geoff Parling, Julian Salvi, Jamie Gibson, Brad Thorn and, possibly, Mathew Tait. Bayonne\u2019s Top 14 relegation is complicating the centre\u2019s move to France; if he wants to guarantee himself an exciting future he should give Bath a call instead.
