The occasion was hardly inspiring: Sharjah, a perennial dustbin for meaningless one-day tournaments, had never seemed more irrelevant than when it staged a four-team tournament barely a week after the World Cup final. Even by the standards of Pakistan cricket, the week had been a fraught one. There had been enough time to part company with the coach, Richard Pybus, for the umpteenth time, and to sack Waqar, the captain, who promptly followed Wasim into international retirement. Wasim and Waqar had floundered in South Africa, in what turned out to be one World Cup too far. They had never been soul brothers, but in one-day terms they were virtually inseparable: Wasim, 502 wickets; Waqar 416; and 618 one-day internationals between them. Their retirement, while overdue, left a huge gulf. Sami, slight of build for a fast bowler, with an unruly shock of hair, provided an instant response. When he recorded 97.2mph against Zimbabwe - a figure verified by a second speedgun - he followed his team-mate Shoaib Akhtar and Australia's Brett Lee as the third fastest in modern times. \"It didn't feel any different,\" said Sami, as he prepared for today's opening NatWest Challenge ODI against England at Old Trafford. But Pakistan cricket certainly felt different. Add the emergence of Umar Gul, a graduate of the Under-19s, and hope sprang of a new fast-bowling hierarchy. Sami persistently bowled above 90mph in his new-ball spell, and maintained the standard the following day against Sri Lanka. The prediction made by Wasim three years earlier, when he described Sami, then 18, as \"at least as fast as Shoaib\" was evidently justified. The promise of his Test debut, when he took eight wickets against New Zealand at Auckland in March 2001, had been fulfilled. Javed Miandad, Pakistan's coach, hints that Sami's emergence has been unnecessarily delayed. \"He is bowling fast because he has been given the opportunity,\" he said. \"Sami is a natural fast bowler, but he can only prove his talent if he is selected. There is no value looking back to the past. It is only what can be done today that matters. I recognised Sami's potential in my first period as coach, but unfortunately he has not had enough chances. If he had played a few years back, he would have been an even better bowler now. \"Sami's vision should be to put his name among the greats. He must be a top-class bowler in his own mind. Wasim and Waqar should be his inspiration. He is not complete yet, but he is a fighter and he is ambitious, and that means everything.\" Pakistan's recent dearth of home series, due to the war in neighbouring Afghanistan, has placed extra demands on their players. It is hard to imagine the likes of Steve Harmison or Marcus Tres cothick successfully adapting to a life of perpetual touring. Sami, though, is not seeking excuses. \"For an older player, all the travelling might have been difficult,\" he said. \"But for me it has been exciting - the chance to experience lots of places I have never seen. We have some home series scheduled for later this year, but until then I am enjoying the travelling.\" His return to Karachi after the NatWest Challenge will be delayed for two months, having won a contract at Kent, where he will replace the Australian batsman Greg Blewett. Like many young sportsmen, he staves off occasional loneliness with music and by gossiping in internet chatrooms. His musical tastes range from Kylie Minogue to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who by the time he died six years ago had long become the most famous exponent of Pakistan's traditional Qawwali music. Sami puts his extra pace down to a more carefully monitored diet and three gym sessions a week. He has filled out to about 72kg, but he lacks the physical presence of Waqar or Wasim and probably always will. He dashes to the crease with a little man's bristle. He speaks respectfully of Wasim and Waqar, and shares their ability to swing the ball at high speed, but his World Cup could not have been more frustrating. \"I only played one game - but it rained,\" he said. The dawning realisation that this was the abandoned match against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, which caused England, as well as Pakistan, to crash out of the World Cup, brings a mischievous twinkle to his eye. For England and Pakistan there is much talk of new beginnings. Sami will have quite an influence upon which side has retained its optimism by Sunday evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
