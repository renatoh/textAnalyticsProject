But the murals themselves have been the subject of student complaint for at least five decades. The 1,600-sq-ft New Deal-era art installation, painted by the Russian emigre Victor Arnautoff, depicts the life of Washington in 13 scenes and spans the space of the school\u2019s staircase and lobby. In one, Washington stands over a map of a young America while pointing westward as four white settlers with rifles walk over the body of a deceased Native American. At the dead man\u2019s feet, another Native American, wearing a headdress, shares a pipe with an armed white man. In another scene, Washington meets a white man gesturing at some of Washington\u2019s slaves at work: a shoeless black man shucking corn, three stooped black women picking cotton and another black man hammering wood for a group of white men manufacturing barrels. \u201cI was never taught the purpose or message of these murals when I was in high school,\u201d said Nancy Trong, a George Washington high school alum, at the school board meeting. \u201cThese murals are not teaching students about the history of slavery or historical genocide that happened under George Washington and other settlers. Instead, it is teaching students to normalize violence and death of our black and indigenous communities.\u201d The cost of painting over the murals will be at least $600,000, while obscuring the artwork with panels could cost up to $825,000. Many argued at the meeting that it did not appear to be the artist\u2019s intent to celebrate these acts of violence and subjugation, and that students needed to learn about this too-often overlooked part of this country\u2019s history. \u201cThese murals are not racist,\u201d argued Jeff Powers, a member of the Socialist Workers party. \u201cThey don\u2019t glorify racism. They\u2019re an artist\u2019s interpretation of a society that is racist, and it\u2019s important for us to study that and look at these murals.\u201d But those in favor of the removal pointed out that by presenting the murals without context, the school wasn\u2019t educating the students. Instead, those unaffected by the history grew inured to the violent images, joking to \u201cmeet under the dead Indian\u201d, while the students from the communities depicted suffered in silence. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of censorship, it\u2019s a matter of human right: the right to learn without hostile environments,\u201d said Paloma Flores, a member of California\u2019s Pitt River Tribe who is also the district\u2019s Indian education program coordinator. \u201cEven the best intentions do harm, and one\u2019s intent does not negate all the lived experience that we live every single day of our lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
