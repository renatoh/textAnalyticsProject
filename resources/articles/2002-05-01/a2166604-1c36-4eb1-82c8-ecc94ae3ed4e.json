I believe June would be a good month. I am retired, in my sixties and used to travelling alone. What route do you suggest I take, and what method of travel? I plan to fly there. I do drive but find I miss the views when doing so, and I'd prefer to spend as little as possible on accommodation. Valery Shell, by email June is a great time to be in northern Europe. The weather should be warm, but there won't be the crowds that you'll find in July and August. Start in either Copenhagen, Malm\u00f6 or Stockholm. All are cheaply accessible from the UK. After a couple of days in Copenhagen, you can cross the bridge to southern Sweden and explore its lakes and towns. Allow a few days in Stockholm and Gothenburg. Crossing into Norway, you could check out Oslo, Lillehammer and Andalsnes, then head up the coast to Bodo, Narvik and Tromso, and spend some time exploring the Lofoten Islands, with their magnificent peaks and traditional fishing villages. From there, you can loop back down through Sweden or continue on across the top of the Gulf of Bothnia into Finland, exploring Lapland or heading down to Helsinki and checking out Karelia. The castle at Savonlinna and lakes around Joensuu are rightly acclaimed for their tranquillity and silence. One problem you might face is budgeting; the region is not a cheap destination and a month would stretch most travellers' pockets. However, by staying in hostels you can save money and ensure that you meet others of all ages along the way (join the Youth Hostels Association before you go). You can get around much of Scandinavia by a combination of efficient, comfortable trains and buses. Much of the route we've outlined can be done by rail. Think about getting a Scanrail pass - you can get 21 consecutive days' travel for \u00a3192 second class; try Ffestiniog Travel (01766 512400). The Scanrail pass gets you 50 per cent off the fares on many express buses in Norway, where trains don't run, and free travel on others, plus money off tickets on most ferries in the region. East Timor I am researching my master's dissertation on Indonesia after the 1997 financial crash. I have an invitation to interview an illustrious professor on the subject in Singapore. I want to see the newly independent East Timor, and visit a friend in Bali. I am free to travel from the end of June. Will it make a difference price- and weather-wise to go in June or July, and what sort of ticket would you recommend? Josephine Guppy, by email Travelling in June or July won't make much difference to the weather. Singapore will be in the grip of the south-west monsoon, which will make things soggy for at least some of the days you're there, and you can expect Bali to be hot and dry during both months. Fare-wise, think about going in June, as many airlines go up a cost bracket towards the end of the month. Book soon, as all air routes to South East Asia are busy with World Cup fans in June and July. Bridge the World (0870 444 7474) offers flights stopping in Singapore and Bali in mid-June, costing from \u00a3476 to \u00a3756 and over, depending on your specific dates. It will pay to be flexible. The Foreign Office (020 7008 0232) advises against non-essential travel to East Timor. If you're determined, you can fly to Dili from Denpasar in Bali on regular flights with Merpati - it's best to book from Bali. East Timor is still getting on its feet, and hotels and transport are very limited. Veggie Estonia My partner is going to Estonia to see relatives. She is a strict vegetarian. How will she fare? Steve Newman, by email On the whole, vegetarians get a rough deal in Estonia. Meals there usually feature meat, and those wanting something else are often served the same dishes with it removed. If your partner is staying with family, they should be able to provide lots of fresh staples and knock up something tasty, with notice. If she's in a hotel, she could load up on the standard breakfast of bread, cheeses, jam and the like, and pick up nibbles during the day. The capital, Tallinn, has international restaurants, which should offer vegetarian options. There are few meat-free restaurants, however, and little information about what is on offer. Eeslitall, just off the central Raekoja Plats, does have a good vegetarian selection. The Estonian tourist board doesn't have a UK office but gives information on its website. Vegetarians travelling in Britain and Europe should check out Vegetarian Guides (020 7580 8458). Love in Bora Bora How do I plan a honeymoon in Bora Bora? What are the best hotels? Is it the best place in French Polynesia for a honeymoon? Boris, by email Bora Bora is one of the best paradise islands on the planet. The exceptional Bora Bora Lagoon Resort (book through Leading Hotels of the World - 0800 181123 for hotels) offers bungalows over the sea for around \u00a3500 a night, with garden bungalows slightly cheaper. You get everything you could reasonably desire in a paradise island hideaway. The island is scattered with hotels offering a premium service, and if this is what you're after you won't go far wrong on Bora Bora, though Tahiti and Moorea have their fair share of top-end resorts. You can find cheaper hotels and campsites all over the region. Try www.tahiti-tourisme.com . Bear in mind that you might want to do more than hide away in a luxurious room for a week,so think about going somewhere with plenty of activities. On Bora Bora you can take Jeep safaris, go snorkelling and walking and see sharks feed. A dream honeymoon could take in a week in paradise and a few days in a fun city on the way for variety. Siberian stop-offs My girlfriend and I take the Trans-Mongolian train from Berlin to Beijing this summer. Please suggest some scintillating stops. Ciara Zane, Dublin Yekaterinburg makes a good first stop, just over a day from Moscow. It has interesting museums and was the scene of the death of the Romanov family in 1918 - there's a small chapel on the site. Another day down the line is Novosibirsk, gateway to the World Heritage-listed Altay Mountains. Remote and beautiful, they're a great destination for the more adventurous traveller. Arguably the one unmissable stop is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest. A few days in Irkutsk will allow you to explore it. Getting round Mongolia without your own vehicle means stopping in Ulan Bataar and travelling from there. But to reach remote lakes, mountains and monasteries, consider hiring a Jeep, though this is expensive. There's plenty to see in UB, if you just want a flavour of the country. From there it's just under 1,000 miles to Beijing, and you'll have negotiated one of the world's great rail trips. Over to you... readers' feedback To add to what you advised Evie Oliver about the Tatras (21 April), approaching the mountains from the Slovak side is much more advantageous on several counts, though I have nothing against Poland. Slovakia is cheaper, plus it's sunnier and drier. There is much better access by public transport to the mountains from the Slovak side. There are more chairlifts to get you above the tree line, and so give better access to the paths. In June many of the higher paths are still closed for ecological reasons, and some are still snowbound. Maps are best bought out there, and many of the mountain chalets (chata) can be viewed on the web. Robin Bevis \u00b7 We welcome letters.
