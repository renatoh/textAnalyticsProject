When it comes to connecting to unknown networks, the typical Airbnb home network is likely to be less secure than a coffee shop Wi-Fi, hotel internet or even the extensive university network, according to security researcher Jeremy Galloway. Speaking at the BlackHat conference in Las Vegas, Galloway argued that the threat posed by short-term rentals has always been high, but only in the last year has the sector grown to the extent that it should be considered one of the most important risks faced by those travelling. \u201cThe media gets this wrong all the time,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cThe biggest threats you face aren\u2019t from some elite foreign government with zero days, it\u2019s from simple threats.\u201d While security researchers like focusing on esoteric attacks, Galloway argued that an Airbnb rental is far more likely to offer a successful method to steal credentials, infect machines and spy on browsing than most critical vulnerabilities. Galloway\u2019s own revelation came on a holiday to Colorado. \u201cI snowboard like a Texan,\u201d he said, \u201cand I wanted to lift my spirits, so I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll head back to the rental, and hack the network to mess with my friends\u2019 browsing,\u2019 \u201cWithin five minutes flat, I owned the network.\u201d Among security professionals, open public Wi-Fi networks like those at coffee shops are common in attack scenario, because they are so easy to engineer into a \u201cman in the middle\u201d attack: an attacker can insert themselves into the connection, perhaps by pretending to be the coffee shop network themselves, and then intercept and modify traffic on the fly. But the common features of short-term home rentals mean they\u2019re probably even less secure than a typical coffee shop network, Galloway argues. The key problem is that the router at the heart of a home network is almost always physically accessible to everyone who stays: not only the (potentially malicious) homeowner, but also previous visitors. That leaves the network open to what Galloway called the \u201caverage paperclip threat\u201d: sticking a paperclip in the reset button of the router lets any attacker gain full admin rights over the router because they can reset the credentials and take control. From there, they can attack future guests in a variety of ways. Adding a custom DNS server lets the attacker easily perform their own man-in-the-middle attacks, routing net traffic through their own computers even after they\u2019ve left the house. Setting up a service to automatically copy over the log files from the router lets the attacker sit and wait until something valuable appears, even if it\u2019s months later. Simply loading the backup file for the router itself can reveal most of the credentials it has stored, for further access to the network. \u201cTo me, the router security situation is best illustrated by a raging dumpster file,\u201d Galloway said. For homeowners, he recommended simply locking away the router, either in a cupboard or a safe. \u201cLock the router up and it keeps it away from people that are curious \u2026 the point isn\u2019t to create perfect security, the point is to raise the bar. Right now all an attacker needs to do to own a network is want to.\u201d For guests, connecting through a VPN-like TunnelBear can protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, as can simply not using a home Wi-Fi. Ultimately, Galloway concluded: \u201cBe skeptical, be aware. If you don\u2019t trust the network, just don\u2019t use it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
