Coutinho\u2019s demand to leave was rejected by Liverpool as relations soured between the playmaker and club on the eve of the new Premier League season. The Brazil international emailed a transfer request on Friday to Liverpool\u2019s sporting director, Michael Edwards, in direct response to a statement from the club\u2019s owner, Fenway Sports Group, that he will not be sold this summer. Barcelona have had two bids of \u00a372m and \u00a390m rejected for the 25-year-old in recent weeks and are expected to return with a third in light of Coutinho, who signed a five-year contract in January, agitating for a transfer. The Liverpool manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, and club officials are seething over a move that has overshadowed the start of their season at Watford on Saturday. Coutinho is unhappy that FSG has refused to negotiate with the Spanish giants over a possible transfer and publicly stated he will not be sold at any price in this window. Equally there is anger on the club\u2019s part that Coutinho submitted a transfer request having been told in face-to-face meetings with the owners and Klopp that such a move would not be entertained. The FSG president, Mike Gordon, held talks with the Brazilian last week in Munich, where Liverpool were competing in the Audi Cup, to reiterate the owner\u2019s determination to keep him at Anfield. Klopp had a similar conversation with the player in Hong Kong after Barcelona\u2019s opening bid was dismissed, with Coutinho and his agent, Kia Joorabchian, being made aware of FSG\u2019s resolve throughout the summer. Liverpool\u2019s owner went public with that resolve on Friday when it issued a statement that reflected what Klopp has said repeatedly about Coutinho\u2019s future. \u201cWe wish to offer clarity as regards our position on a possible transfer of Philippe Coutinho,\u201d it said. \u201cThe club\u2019s definitive stance is that no offers for Philippe will be considered and that he will remain a member of Liverpool Football Club when the summer window closes.\u201d Coutinho retaliated a few hours later by emailing Edwards. A \u201cfamily friend\u201d of Liverpool\u2019s No10 was then quoted by Sky Sports News as saying: \u201cPhilippe has tried very hard to find an amicable solution to the situation but to no avail. He has tremendous love for the club and its fans but, like Steven Gerrard and Luis Su\u00e1rez have pointed out in the past, Liverpool does not let its players leave on amicable terms.\u201d The transfer request caught Liverpool completely by surprise given their conversations with Coutinho and the fact that, while expressing a wish to join Barcelona, he had not agitated for a move before the FSG statement. The player reported as normal on Friday to Melwood where he received treatment on the back injury that has ruled him out of the Watford opener and possibly Tuesday\u2019s Champions League play-off first leg against Hoffenheim. Liverpool expect him to act professionally despite having the transfer request rejected. At a press conference to preview the Watford game, held before Edwards\u2019 inbox received Coutinho\u2019s email, Klopp admitted: \u201cI can\u2019t keep players happy\u201d but later expressed confidence his prized asset would not push for a transfer. The manager said: \u201cI have known him for 20 months and that\u2019s the only thing I can say about this [he wouldn\u2019t agitate for a move]. There is actually nothing else to say about it. The player is not in team training. I don\u2019t go to the medical department every day and ask things like that. It is completely normal. Nobody comes to me every day and says: \u2018Oh my God! Phil!\u2019 We speak about the injury. That is all.\u201d Klopp also reiterated his belief that Barcelona moved too late in the transfer window for Liverpool even to consider selling Coutinho. \u201cTalking in general, I had to sell a lot of players in my managerial career. Some had clauses, some had no clauses; we had the Lewandowski thing and that was difficult when he went to Bayern on a free transfer. A lot of different things. \u201cThe only thing I can say about this is that in life everything is about timing \u2013 whichever club asks early enough. It\u2019s like how we do it. If we ask early enough, we try to do it. If you ask early enough, you can either switch the plan or whatever. But you cannot come up close to the start of the season with things like this. \u201cThe club is bigger than anybody. That is the most important thing. It\u2019s about doing it in the right moment. It\u2019s how we do it when we want to bring players in. It is about timing. That is how I understand. And that is all I have to say. Maybe everybody has a price \u2013 in the right moment. In the wrong moment? No price.\u201d Klopp, meanwhile, has confirmed Simon Mignolet remains his first choice goalkeeper for the new season. \u201cIn this moment it is Simon one, Loris [Karius] two and Wardy [Danny Ward] three. That is not a decision for the next 20 years, things can happen, but I am as confident as possible that if one gets injured we still have really good options.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
