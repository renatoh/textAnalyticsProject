Scholes has hit the headlines at the beginning of his 17th season as a one-club professional, starring in the Community Shield victory over Chelsea and the Premier League win against Newcastle United to invite plaudits from the game's leading figures. Wenger duly obliged when he was asked yesterday about the 35-year-old's qualities but he undercut the tribute with a scathing assessment of Scholes's notoriously suspect tackling skills. Scholes's propensity for picking up yellow cards is often attributed to clumsiness but Wenger seemed to be having none of that. His players have been bruised over the years by Scholes's studs and Wenger's comments betrayed the frustration that he has felt. \"It depends what you call clever and what you call dirty,\" said Wenger, who was asked whether he felt Scholes tackled unfairly. \"Unfairly, of course, unfairly,\" he replied. \"How many times have you watched Paul Scholes? Have you seen only fair tackles from Paul Scholes? I don't want to come out on one specifically but I can remember a few. [They are] a bit in the past, yes, but look at him playing now. He still doesn't hide. \"No, I don't [think his approach is OK]. You ask me about the quality of the player \u2013 who wouldn't like a Paul Scholes in his team? You ask me: 'Was he a fair player?' I say: 'No, I'm sorry, for me he was not a fair player.' I just think I respect him highly as a quality player. I did not like some things he did on the football pitch and I have the right to say that. It's not because you are older, suddenly, that you are a saint.\" Wenger said that because Scholes was not a \"media lion, who runs to be in the papers\", he has perhaps not received the recognition that he deserves as a player. \"I respect that a lot,\" Wenger added. \"Paul Scholes is still one of the greatest football players in England and his contribution to the success of Manchester United is absolutely huge. The regret I have personally is he was not always the fairest player. There's a little bit of a darker side in him, sometimes, that I did not like.\" Wenger hopes to complete the signing of Sevilla's France centre-half S\u00e9bastien Squillaci for about \u00a34m and there remains a confidence at the club that he will also be able to add the goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Fulham, who have targeted Stoke City's Asmir Begovic as a possible replacement. Wenger has been linked with the Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given but he said that City wanted to keep him. \"The proof is that they offered a new contract to Given,\" he said. Arsenal offered \u00a32m for Schwarzer at the beginning of the summer and, in the wake of the Australian handing in a transfer request, they wrote to the Fulham chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, during the week to tell him that the bid remained on the table. It remains unacceptable, however, to Fulham and Wenger will have to raise the offer to close the deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
