In the summer of 2013, on the back of two undistinguished and largely unheralded loan spells at Leicester and Norwich, Harry Kane was England\u2019s main striker in the Under-20 World Cup in Turkey. Now he is once again leading the line for his country in an international youth tournament but this time, here at the European Under-21 Championship, his preceding season involved a deluge of goals for Tottenham Hotspur and a full England debut. Whereas the 2013 Kane enjoyed relative anonymity the 2015 version cannot walk the 100 yards or so from the team hotel in Olomouc to the Legionarska training ground next door without fielding requests for autographs and photos. On Spurs\u2019 tour of Asia and Australia last month a stroll to a Sydney shopping centre had to be abandoned when hordes of fans mobbed Kane and two team-mates en route. There is a Twitter campaign aimed at making him the man to join Lionel Messi on the front cover of the Fifa 16 video game. England will hope that the differences are not only off the field. In Turkey Peter Taylor\u2019s Under-20s failed to win a game and finished bottom of a group that also included Chile, Egypt and Iraq. Kane could have been forgiven had the opening defeat for the Under-21s against Portugal in Uherske Hradiste on Thursday raised the spectre of tournaments past but the 21-year-old remains confident the team can recover and return to winning ways against Sweden on Sunday. \u201cWe were 2-0 up and in cruise control mode [against Iraq],\u201d said Kane. \u201cThey got a penalty, then ended up scoring in the last minute. As a group that hit us hard and we never really recovered. We drew with Chile in the next game but it isn\u2019t going to happen in this group. We\u2019ve got too many experienced players who have been there before and done it not to put it right. We know what we have to do.\u201d His development since that troublesome tournament in Turkey has been rapid and the trappings accompanying new-found fame at times mind-boggling. Kane describes that shopping trip in Sydney as the most surreal experience of his career \u2013 the players had to make their escape back to the team hotel by hopping on to a coach, which was fortunately nearby \u2013 but is unflustered by the attention. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s just the start for me. Maybe in the years to come I\u2019ll get a bit grumpy but no, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve always been happy to talk to fans, to do things with fans. Sometimes you don\u2019t know how far they\u2019ve travelled just to meet you. So if you don\u2019t sign something or don\u2019t talk to them it could be heartbreaking for them. \u201cI was a fan once and I\u2019d always want someone I\u2019ve looked up to to be a nice guy and that\u2019s what I try and be. I don\u2019t think that will ever change. I think I\u2019ll always sign stuff for fans and take pictures because I know how much it means.\u201d Kane\u2019s focus for the next few days, though, will be on keeping England in the tournament. Against Portugal there were moments when a gap in class was apparent. For example, when Monaco\u2019s Bernardo Silva and Sporting\u2019s Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio, both of whom played Champions League football last season, were breaking past Nathaniel Chalobah, who ended the season at Reading, and on towards Middlesbrough\u2019s Ben Gibson and Leicester\u2019s Liam Moore in the centre of the England defence. But the gap was not as big as those CVs suggest. And Rui Jorge\u2019s side were arguably the most impressive of the eight here in the first round of matches. Sweden, who beat Italy despite being reduced to 10 men and went 1-0 down after 28 minutes, offer a different threat, a more direct, muscular and \u2013 whisper it \u2013 typically English approach in their 4-4-2 formation. That could allow greater freedom for Tom Carroll in the central attacking midfield role and, in the wide positions, Nathan Redmond and Alex Pritchard, who may replace Jesse Lingard in the starting XI after impressing as a late substitute on Thursday. The chief aim, though, for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side must be to get more support to Kane, who cut an occasionally isolated figure against Portugal. He denies his team-mates look to him as England\u2019s main man \u2013 \u201cWe have a lot of players in this squad that have done well this season for their clubs; I am just one of them\u201d \u2013 but on the occasions he was able to find space on the ball against Portugal he proved his threat, with one fizzing effort from distance particularly troubling Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 in the Portugal goal. In the absence of the injured Saido Berahino, top scorer in qualifying, Kane\u2019s goal threat becomes even more vital. Although Kane is confident this squad will not crumble under the pressure, five straight defeats at these finals is a worrying trend and one that needs to end. \u201cWe are not panicking,\u201d said Kane. \u201cWe know what we have to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
