This defeat, however, left Wolves a write-off in terms of Premiership survival. An abject away record of no wins in 16 attempts meant Wolves had pinned their remote hopes of avoiding relegation on winning their five remaining home games. Yet in the first of them, they responded with a supine performance. Jones remained defiant but he conceded Wolves have been an accident waiting to happen for the past 18 months. \"This club has a habit of pursuing one plan, giving up on it and then doing something else,\" he said. \"It's important to put together a plan and stick to it. The thing I like to do is build and build but the building at this club stopped 18 months ago. The investment has not been there.\" Wolves have been becalmed since Sir Jack Hayward stopped pouring in his personal fortune, a decision that culminated in September with the multi-millionaire deciding to cut his losses and give the club away. The \"free\" offer does include some small print, however, not least that potential owners need a minimum of \u00a320m to invest and must have the club's best interests at heart. So far there have been no takers. Wolves played with a similar lack of interest, failing to trouble Antti Niemi with a direct shot until Henri Camara scored his second goal in two games - by which time the visitors were set fair for their third win in four games since Paul Sturrock took over. James Beattie had put them on course, thumping home a long ball from Fabrice Fernandes, before Claus Lundekvam prodded in a free-kick from the same provider. If anyone doubted that Wolves were doomed, the fact that the game was effectively settled by a goal from the Norwegian defender must have convinced them. Lundekvam's first goal for Saints in 295 games ended a drought lasting eight years and including the time Jones was manager. More familiar service was resumed when, with Camara attempting to stage a one-man rescue operation, Wolves were twice caught on the break by Kevin Phillips. The double was a just reward for Phillips, whose movement and close control gave Wolves little respite. Sturrock was delighted. \"Our two strikers were superb,\" he said. \"If Beattie plays to that standard there's no reason why he cannot force his way into the England squad, especially if players get injured or lose form. And Kevin Phillips has got a twinkle in his step. He's back to the scoring form that made him such a threat with Sunderland.\" Southampton fans are being banned by Portsmouth from tomorrow's reserves match at Fratton Park because of trouble after the Premiership game on March 21.
