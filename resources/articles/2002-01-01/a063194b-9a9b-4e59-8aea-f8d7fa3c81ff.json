A goal in each half set them up with a home match against Sheffield United while Bobby Zamora, the Albion striker creating such interest among the managerial fraternity, drew another blank. The visitors began much the stronger and Kerry Mayo had to head off the line in the eighth minute. But Preston took the lead eight minutes later when David Healy set up Eric Skora, who shot past the exposed Will Packham. Skora is a 20-year-old Frenchman who made his debut on Saturday while Packham, a year older, was playing his first game for Brighton because Michel Kuipers failed a fitness test on a thigh and his deputy, Simon Royce, is Cup-tied as well as injured. Brighton had the chance to equalise four minutes later when Daniel Webb was brought down in the area by Colin Murdock but Zamora's spot-kick was a feeble effort and David Lucas saved with some ease. Zamora, who has 19 goals this season but had failed to score in the previous three matches, chose an unfortunate time to miss. He was being watched by the Everton manager Walter Smith and his Crystal Palace counterpart Trevor Francis. Everton, who also watched Zamora earlier in the season, are believed to have offered \u00a33m but the Seagulls are unlikely to accept as a third of any fee would go to his former club Bristol Rovers. Preston had been through a patchy run, with two wins in 10 matches, but they relished the chance to play themselves back into form against a Second Division club. And they continued to press their hosts back in the second half, with Jon Macken testing Packham with a firm drive three minutes after the interval. When Brighton were allowed to counter-attack they seemed so surprised that they did not know what to do. Indeed in the 51st minute the ball fell to Zamora but he sent a volley within a pace of a corner flag. It was no surprise when Preston extended their lead. Macken was 25 yards out when he tested Packham, who will never forget the moment he allowed the ball to bounce off his arms and into the net. It was the softest of goals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
