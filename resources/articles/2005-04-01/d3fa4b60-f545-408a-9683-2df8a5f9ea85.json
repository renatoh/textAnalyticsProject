But it was not until Hartson, who had struck late in the first half, rose to power home Stilian Petrov's 75th-minute cross that Celtic were able to relax and enjoy their success. Hartson finished a splendid evening's work by claiming his third from the penalty spot in the 86th minute after he had been impeded by David McNamee. Stanislav Varga scored a fourth in the final minute. \"I knew John would score at some stage or another but he has rewarded us tonight,\" said the Celtic manager Martin O'Neill. \"The goals and his second-half display will give him an enormous lift.\" Craig Bellamy displayed great urgency yet the striker fluffed his lines when one-on-one with Roddy McKenzie in the 22nd minute, shooting straight at the goalkeeper, who saved with his legs. Livingston were looking to enhance their survival prospects after falling into bottom spot in the table through Dundee United's unforeseen victory over Rangers 24 hours earlier. The home side had a physical presence previously missing this season, reminis cent of their manager Richard Gough when he captained Rangers with great distinction. But Hartson removed any unease among the Celtic fans when he scored two minutes before the interval. Joos Valgaeren and Emmanuel Dorado challenged for Jackie McNamara's cross and the ball broke kindly for Hartson, who was able to prod it into the net. Hibernian came from behind to beat Hearts at Tynecastle for the first time in nearly six years. Garry O'Connor and Dean Shiels overturned Hearts' lead, provided by Lee Miller."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
