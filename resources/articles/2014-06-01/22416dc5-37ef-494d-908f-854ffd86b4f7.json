Milk must also be available to primary and secondary pupils during the school day under the new rules which come into force in January. Pupils will only be offered two portions of deep-fried, battered and breadcrumb-coated foods each week under the rules outlined by Gove. Pastry-based dishes will be subject to the same restrictions, schools will be completely banned from offering chocolate and confectionery in canteens and tuck shops, and salt will not be available for pupils to add to food after it is cooked. Gove has unveiled clearer food standards for all state schools in England \u2013 and imposed the new rules on free schools and academies that were previously exempt from national standards in an effort to free them from regulations. But the new rules \u2013 which are a simplified version of the existing school food code introduced under the previous Labour government \u2013 will only apply to new academies and free schools yet to open, because of the legal complications of inserting clauses into the contracts of the academies that have opened since 2010. Gove was criticised by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver for allowing academies and free schools to \"erode\" the tougher rules introduced after Oliver had publicised the poor quality and nutrition of school lunches. This time, the Department for Education hopes that the 1,500 academies and free schools that opened in England between 2010 and 2014 will voluntarily sign up to the new regulations. Academies created under Labour were already required to adopt national food standards. \"We now have a clear and concise set of food standards which are easier for cooks to follow and less expensive to enforce. Crucially we have achieved this without any compromise on quality or nutrition,\" Gove said in announcing the new standards. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, welcomed the decision, but said it was \"a missed opportunity\" in allowing existing academies and free schools to opt out. \"This will mean that over half of state-funded secondary schools and over 10% of primaries in England will only be required to sign up to the standards on a voluntary basis. Parents of children in these schools will rightly be unhappy that the Government is failing to deliver the same guarantee of minimum nutritional food standards for all school,\" Blower said. The new regulations retain many of the health and nutrition regulations adopted in 2008 and 2009, including a ban on fatty snacks such as crisps, a restriction on the serving of fried food to two lunches a week, and the promotion of water and milk instead of sugary drinks. The most significant change is the scrapping of strict reporting and nutrition targets, which have been criticised by schools and caterers as cumbersome and expensive, with chefs having to use software to judge the content of every menu. The new regulations also include some tougher measures, restricting serving portions of fruit juice to 150ml and mandating that low-fat milk be available for sale. The DfE said that the new standards had proven to be popular with school cooks during trials, and were just as effective at delivering the appropriate energy and nutrients. Secondary schools that trialed the new rules reported an increase in the consumption of vegetables."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
