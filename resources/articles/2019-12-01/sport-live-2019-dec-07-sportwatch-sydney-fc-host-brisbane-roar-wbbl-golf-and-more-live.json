Sydney FC were on a different planet tonight and, with a clear buffer on top of the ladder, will be very hard to stop in their bid to be champions for a second straight season. Le Fondre\u2019s first A-League hat-trick takes him above Jamie Maclaren on the goal-scoring charts and he can thank the likes of Baumjohann, Ninkovic and Barbarouses for the shiniest of silver service. A great performance by Sydney FC and a great day of sport. Thanks for your company. See you soon. Brisbane get a consolation goal, a penalty to O\u2019Donovan, after a clear infringement in the box. Not the way Sydney wanted to end the game, but 5-1 it is. Le Fondre gets a hat-trick, his first in the A-League, by heading home a delightful little cross from Buhagiar. My, hasn\u2019t that man had an impact in his few moments on the pitch. This is about right, 5-0. Le Fondre turns provider, picking out Baumjohann with a searching ball on the right and this time it\u2019s Buhagiar who finds himself on the final pass - and the man who\u2019s been on for less than a minute makes no mistake. 85 mins: Buhagiar on for Barbarouses, who positively sprints off the pitch after what happened to Ninkovic. 82 mins: Ryan Teague, Australia\u2019s U17s skipper, replaces Brattan to run on for the first time in an A-League game. Good luck, young man. 81 mins: Barbarouses again and again Young is good enough to keep the deficit to three goals, blocking the full-blooded shot with his outstretched right hand. Good stop. 77 mins: Sydney squander a chance to go 4-0 up with Caceres and Barbarouses each having a good chance to beat the keeper, but Young, who\u2019s had plenty of practice tonight, is equal to the task. At the other end, O\u2019Donovan attempts a bicycle kick. Nice try but nothing doing. 69 mins: Yellow card! Le Fondre\u2019s got a bit to say to the ref, perhaps not happy with how he\u2019s being treated, and whatever he said was enough to draw a yellow. And now it\u2019s time for Sydney\u2019s first change - Ninkovic off for Caceres. The ref is getting rather officious and brandishes a yellow card for Ninkovic, who didn\u2019t depart the field of play quite as quickly, or directly, as the whistleblower would\u2019ve liked. 63 mins: NO GOAL! Le Fondre waltzes into a one-on-one with the keeper and \u2018scores\u2019 his hat-trick, but the flag was up for off-side. Moments later Le Fondre goes down after a coming-together with Aldred, who\u2019s already on a yellow. 59 mins: Another change for Amadi-Holloway on for Wenzel-Halls. So, thankfully, the hyphen equilibrium is restored. That\u2019s Fowler done for the night in terms of substitutions. Amadi-Holloway makes an immediate impact, making the keeper work with a cute little back-heel. 57 mins: Yellow card! Baumjohann again. Yellow card again. This time Brisbane resort to the old hands-over-the-shoulder-and-drag-this-bloke-to-the-turf routine. This time it\u2019s O\u2019Neill whose name goes into the book. 54 mins: Yellow card! Baumjohann does what Baumjohann does, ball on a string and all that, and Aldred has had enough, chopping the playmaker down with cynical intent to rightfully attract a yellow. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken the Roar this long to go the knuckle. 50 mins: Baumjohann, light on those twinkletoes of his, dances around a defender or two but can\u2019t get past another. For a fleeting moment it looked like he might scythe through the lot of them and make it 4-0. But no. Not yet. 46 mins: A double change for Brisbane. Fowler might have liked to make it 11 in, 11 out. But it\u2019s just the two - Bowles on for Gillesphey, and Powell on for Inman. A complete mismatch. Sydney\u2019s ball players are doing as they please - Baumjohann, Ninkovic and Barbarouses are cutting the Roar to ribbons - and Le Fondre is doing the rest. Brisbane have won just one of their past 19 A-League games away from home. It\u2019s about to be one of their past 20. How\u2019s this for a sausage roll? Wow. A stunningly weighted ball from Grant, on the right just inside his own half, finds Barbarouses, who cuts back into the path of Le Fondre and the striker caresses the ball into the top-left corner. Brisbane in disarray, and likely in awe of this vastly superior opponent. 31 mins: The Roar defence is again stretched as Le Fondre picks out Barbarouses but the angle gets away from him and the keeper protects his near post. Here\u2019s Ninkovic\u2019s goal. I think Baumjohann is my new favourite player. Baumjohann to Barbarouses to Ninkovic. Goal. Training ground stuff from a seriously good football team and Brisbane just have no answer to it. Baumjohann shows poise and patience to find Barbarouses, whose cross along the floor finds Ninkovic directly in front and the rest is history. This could get ugly. This is ugly. 23 mins: Neville is afforded some rare space down the right and has a chance to produce a good cross, but the execution just isn\u2019t there. The ball slingshots down the other end and Barbarouses beats his direct opponent but shoots just wide of the right post. 16 mins: A chance for Brisbane with Gillesphey lining up for a free kick just outside the box. Beckham would\u2019ve gobbled it up, but Gillesphey isn\u2019t Beckham. Gillesphey is Gillesphey. The ball flies over the crossbar. Here\u2019s Le Fondre\u2019s goal. The one that counted. 12 mins: NO GOAL! Le Fondre runs at angles and the Roar defence has no idea where he is as Baumjohann releases the striker, who beats the keeper one-on-one to seemingly make it 2-0. But Le Fondre himself looks doubtful and Brisbane get the requisite video assistance. The Sydney FC man was off-side, marginally, but off-side all the same. Still, these are bad signs for the visiting team. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ball from Ninkovic splits the Roar defence wide open and releases Barbarouses, who cuts back from the right and the resultant loose ball is pounced upon by Le Fondre. And Le Fondre rarely needs to be asked twice. First blood to Sydney FC. Did I mention that the ball from Ninkovic was beautiful? 3 mins: Early free kick for Sydney FC, deep in their own half. So no imminent threat, but Robbie Fowler\u2019s brow still looks very furrowed. You see that a lot these days. I much preferred it when he was a player and celebrating goals by rubbing his nose along the boundary line. 1 min: And we\u2019re away. Playing surface looks lovely. How\u2019s this for a stat: Brisbane Roar are yet to score a first-half goal this A-League season. SYDNEY FC (4-2-2-2) - Andrew Redmayne (GK); Rhyan Grant, Ryan McGowan, Alex Wilkinson, Joel King; Luke Brattan, Paulo Retre; Alexander Baumjohann, Milos Ninkovic; Kosta Barbarouses, Adam Le Fondre. BRISBANE ROAR (4-4-2) - Jamie Young (GK); Scott Neville, Tom Aldred, Jordan Courtney-Perkins, Macaulay Gillesphey; Bradden Inman, Aiden O\u2019Neill, Jay O\u2019Shea, Stefan Mauk; Dylan Wenzel-Halls, Roy O\u2019Donovan. Just minutes away from tonight\u2019s A-League game between Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar at Kogarah, which as it happens is just down the road from Chez Heinrich. Anyway, doesn\u2019t seem as smoky today as it has been. But on the teams front, Brandon O\u2019Neill is a big out for Sydney FC after failing to recover from a knock suffered against Western United. Speaking of Markus Babbel, have you seen David Squires\u2019 latest hilarious offering? It\u2019s about the Grosse Deutsche. A third straight win for the Nix, which takes them into the top six on the ladder. More VAR drama, however, with Wellington claiming all three points after a handball in the box that preceded D\u00e1vila\u2019s 89th-minute penalty. Cue controversy, fallout and an even bigger headache for Markus Babbel. In the Australian Open golf tournament, Matt Jones is poised to become a multiple winner of the event after posting a three-under 68 on moving day. Thanks to AAP, here\u2019s a snapshot of the day: PLAYER OF THE DAY: Matt Jones - the 2015 champion and 2017 runner-up continued his affinity with The Australian, where he\u2019s a member, to grab a three-stroke lead with his three-under-par 68 SHOT OF THE DAY: It takes a pretty special shot to finish up a tree but that\u2019s exactly what last year\u2019s runner-up Dimi Papadatos did with his drive on the par-4 12th hole QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI did see and it was pretty ordinary, to be honest.\u201d Marc Leishman reckons American Patrick Reed deserves all the roasting he gets from fans at next week\u2019s Presidents Cup in Melbourne after being penalised two strokes for illegal play on Saturday at Tiger Woods\u2019 Hero Challenge in the Bahamas TOURNAMENT SUMMARY: Jones is poised to join some of the legends of golf as a multiple Open champion as he heads into the final round three shots clear of American Cameron Tringale and four ahead of Japanese amateur Takumi Kanaya, South African Louis Oosthuizen (70) and Englishman Paul Casey How about the MCG pitch? Today\u2019s play in the Sheffield Shield match between Victoria and Western Australia was abandoned because the deck was deemed unsafe. Like me rushing to the bar for first shout of the evening, you don\u2019t see that too often. Takes me back to one of my first gigs as a budding young reporter, covering a Test match between West Indies and England that lasted 10 overs and one ball before sanity prevailed and the match was called off. Lynn Williams cancelled out the first-half strike of Melbourne Victory\u2019s Haley Hanson to ensure spoils were shared at Latrobe City Stadium. Not a bad result for the hosts against a Wanderers team that sits atop the ladder (for now). The two protagonists have been decided for tomorrow\u2019s WBBL final. Defending champs Brisbane Heat were too good for Melbourne Renegades and Adelaide Strikers were likewise much superior to Perth Scorchers. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Relive the wonderment of the two liveblogs hosted by Geoff Lemon, who needs a new set of fingernails and a new keyboard after today\u2019s Herculean effort. Yes, so what more can be said about Sam Kerr? Frightening thing is, given she\u2019s only 26 we\u2019ll be saying lots more about her in the coming years. Better invent some new superlatives. The latest accolade to come her way is courtesy of this fine media brand, which today named the Matildas captain the best female football player on the planet. No argument from me or from Samantha Lewis, who penned this delightful tribute about the Australian superstar we all love to love. Evening, sports fans. It\u2019s been one of those days when too much sport is barely enough (thanks, HG), and gosh there\u2019s already been plenty to sink the canines into today. We\u2019ve had the two WBBL semi-finals, action in the A-League and W-League has been happening and will continue to happen, it\u2019s the third round of the Australia Open golf tournament and, as if often the case these days, the inimitable Sam Kerr has been in the headlines. More on that in a later post. But without further ado, let\u2019s get cracking.
