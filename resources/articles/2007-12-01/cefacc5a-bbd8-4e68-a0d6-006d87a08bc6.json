Despite being a loyal phone customer of BT since the end of the second world war, the widow, who suffers from mild dementia and is registered blind, has become the latest victim of BT's controversial reconnection policy. Mrs Myers' problems started when she was asked by her nursing home - the Lynwood centre in Ascot, Berkshire, which is run by the charity Ben - to temporarily move to another room to allow hers to be renovated. According to her granddaughter Jenny Johnson, who has power of attorney over her affairs, staff at the home arranged for her phone line to be switched over to the temporary room without incident. However, when - after a few weeks - it was time to move back to her old room, Mrs Johnson was told by BT that Mrs Myers' phone line had been given to another customer, and that a \u00a3125 charge would have to be paid if she wanted the service back on - this despite no apparent break in service. Dozens of Guardian Money readers have written to complain about the same problem since we first revealed that BT had started imposing the charge - usually when its customers move house. \"My grandmother relies on her phone as her connection with the outside world,\" says Mrs Johnson. \"When she needs anything - usually chocolate or cigarettes - she rings us up and we do the rest. She's 91, registered blind, and uses an adapted phone with extra large buttons. What is she supposed to do without a phone?\" Thinking that there must have been a mistake, Mrs Johnson, who works for the Law Society, queried the charge with BT's billing centre. She pointed out that Mrs Myers is entirely reliant on state support for her care, and receives only \u00a320 a week for her personal needs. \"The charge of \u00a3124.99 is very hard for her to bear, particularly as it has arisen through no fault of her own,\" she wrote. Instead of an apology and an offer to refund the charge, she received the following email: \"I have carefully considered your comments and looked into the points you raised ... I would like to inform that I have checked the order carefully for the connection charges and the connection charges are correctly applied as the line was again reallocated to the room back.\" Certainly she's not the only one to receive the same message. The new charges have arisen, with the apparent consent of the telecoms regulator Ofcom, because BT now operates two separate businesses - its wholesale division, Openreach, and a separate residential service. Two weeks ago we revealed that new occupiers are automatically being charged the \u00a3125 fee, regardless of who used to supply the phone service. BT says the imposition of the charge largely depends on whether the house is near a busy exchange, where demand for lines is high. In that case, lines freed up are being quickly offered for re-use. The company says the charge should not be payable if the previous occupier was with BT. This has been disproved by many readers' experiences, including that of Mrs Myers. Some would say it appears to be taking advantage of the fact that it controls the network to hit customers with the charge, regardless of their circumstances. Asked about the case of Mrs Myers, BT said: \"The charges were correct, but we didn't give clear advice on what might be the cheapest and simplest solution. We would like to apologise to Mrs Myers and, as a goodwill gesture, we have agreed to refund the connection charge.\" m.brignall@guardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
