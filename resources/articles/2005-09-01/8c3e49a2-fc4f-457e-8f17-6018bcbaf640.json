The Gibraltar-based group, formerly known as Cassava Enterprises, is due to set the pricing range for its London listing this week. When it announced plans to float this month it said it was aiming for a valuation of up to $1.5bn (\u00a3800m) However, that was before the profit warning from PartyGaming, the company behind PartyPoker, raised concerns about an industry-wide slowdown. As such, the pricing of the 888 is being seen as a key test of sentiment towards the fledgling online gaming sector. A disappointing valuation for 888 would, according to market professionals, spark further selling of gaming stocks, which have been under pressure since the PartyGaming warning. As a precaution traders said clients were lightening holdings of PartyGaming, down 5.75p at 101p, Sportingbet, 9.5p lighter at 311p, and Empire Online, off 9.5p at 244p, yesterday. They noted selling of online payment companies Neteller, 53.5p weaker at 839p, and FireOne, 16p cheaper at 427.5p. Leading shares closed sharply lower, dragged down by the heavyweight oil sector, which was under pressure as the crude price hovered about $64 a barrel. BG Group fell 12.75p to 504.75p, while BP, London's biggest listed company, slipped 6.5p to close at 632.5p. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 down 37.1 points at 5,338 with Smith &amp; Nephew, off 43.5p at 509p, the biggest faller after lowering full-year sales and profit forecasts because of the disruption caused by Hurricane Katrina to US hospitals. Traders noted that S&amp;N shares had been under pressure before the warning after Merrill Lynch said in a research note that it was concerned about margins and sales growth. Elsewhere, the picture was much the same. The FTSE 250 fell 68.1 points to close at 7,833.3, while the FTSE Small Cap index shed 9.2 points to finish at 3,131.6. Market turnover was light at about 2.3bn shares. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 104.510, yielding 4.192%. Marks &amp; Spencer was one of the session's main talking points. Its shares eased 5.5p to 348p after the US broker Morgan Stanley placed 23m shares at 348.5p each for a client, rumoured to be Brandes, the US value fund that owns 9% of M&amp;S. Late in the day, however, Stuart Rose, the M&amp;S chief, declared the purchase of 50,000 shares at 347p each. All told, it was a busy day for Morgan Stanley, which offloaded 5m Royal Bank of Scotland shares and 12m Lloyds TSB shares at 1611p and 474.5p respectively. The talk in the market was that Morgan Stanley had sold the stock for a client who used the proceeds to buy 7.5m HSBC shares. HSBC closed unchanged at 894p, while RBS fell 16p to 1612p and Lloyds eased 5.75p to 474.5p. Scottish Power, up 4.75p to 574p, managed to buck the weak market trend, however, amid talk that it is set to recommend a 600p-a-share cash offer from Germany's E.ON. On Monday, analysts estimated that E.ON, which owns Powergen, could afford to pay up to 650p for ScottishPower. BT Group, 1.25p stronger at 291.5p, also closed higher after JP Morgan reiterated its \"overweight\" recommendation following what it described as a bullish meeting with the company. Cobham was top dog in the FTSE 250 after half-year figures topped expectations, and the aerospace and defence firm announced plans to focus on six divisions. The shares rose 14.75p to 158p. The Mecca bingo group Rank was a strong performer, rising 19p to 310p on talk of a 320p-a-share bid from the US private equity group Blackstone. Traders said rumours had been stoked by the fact that Rank's senior managers are in the US. However, sources said they were just visiting some of its operations in Orlando and California. On the downside, Luminar, the UK's leading nightclub operator, slipped 11p to 493p after Altium Securities warned clients that tomorrow's trading update could disappoint and that profit forecasts might have to be cut. Altium's analyst Greg Feehley is concerned about the performance of Luminar's entertainment division, which was put up for sale earlier this year. \"We understand a new strategy for this division will not be announced until November. Substantial investment may be required, potentially further disappointing those long suffering shareholders anticipating a return of cash,\" he said. Among the small caps, Celtic Resources rallied 14.5p to 221.5p after the stockbroker Ambrian said the shares were good value at current levels. Even if, as has been rumoured, Celtic's stake in the Nezdaninskoye gold mine is just 20%, Ambrian reckons the firm is still worth \u00a386.5m, around its current market value. \"For those playing close attention to the share price, there is massive upside in the event that the negative news circulating transpires to be false,\" Ambrian said. Rumours of a bid approach saw Advanced Fluid Solutions, the pipe-fitting group formerly known as Oystertec, hold steady at 12.25p, while Tepnel Life Sciences fell 0.25p to 8p. Traders reckon it could rally today now that an overhang has been cleared. Crude talk A falling crude price was not the only reason for the weakness among oil exploration and production stocks yesterday. Traders said fears that chancellor Gordon Brown may increase taxes on North Sea oil profits also weighed on the sector. According to Numis Securities there is a real chance that the chancellor will increase the tax burden some time after the pre-budget report, due later this year. Numis analyst Andrew Whittock reckoned a rise would probably take the form of another increase in North Sea corporate tax rates from 40% to 50%. He saw Paladin Resources, down 8.75p to 293p, Venture Production, off 17.75p to 482p, and Oilexco, 6.5p lower at 172.5p, as the companies most exposed to any increase in North Sea oil taxes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
