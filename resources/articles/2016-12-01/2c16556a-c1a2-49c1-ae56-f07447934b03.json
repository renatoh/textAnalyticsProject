There\u2019s a simpler word: lies, 17 December, page 41) said that writer David Roberts would have a good claim to having coined the term \u201cpost-truth\u201d in 2010. However, Oxford Dictionaries dates the first use to a 1992 essay by the playwright Steve Tesich in the Nation magazine. Ralph Keyes borrowed it for his 2004 book, The Post-Truth Era. \u2022 An editorial about the Finnish writer Tove Jansson was wrong to say, when giving a short history of her homeland, that Finland was occupied by the Red Army for four years after the end of the second world war (A greater writer makes a very particular world we can all share, 17 December, page 40). \u2022 Zwickau, in Germany, is about 50 miles (or 80km) east of Jena, not 200 miles as we had it (The neo-Nazi murders putting Germany on trial, 15 December, page 35)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
