Cardinal Sean O'Malley, archbishop of Boston, said: \"The Catholic bishops of the United States have asked that Catholic institutions not honour government officials or politicians who promote abortion with their laws and policies \"I am sure that the invitation was made in good faith, long before it came to the attention of the leadership of Boston College that Mr Kenny is aggressively promoting abortion legislation. \"Since the university has not withdrawn the invitation and because the Taoiseach has not seen fit to decline, I shall not attend the graduation.\" Kenny is to address graduates at the 137th annual Boston College Commencement Exercises on 20 May. His coalition is preparing a law to allow abortions where a woman's life is at risk if pregnancy continues, or in circumstances where she is suicidal. The leader of Ireland's Catholics, Cardinal Se\u00e1n Brady, has threatened to excommunicate members of the Irish parliament who vote for the abortion legislation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
