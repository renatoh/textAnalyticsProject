Ziege has been dogged by injury throughout his five years in the Premiership and made just 44 league starts in his three seasons at Spurs. But despite missing most of the 2003/04 season with injury, he recently won a surprise late call-up to Germany's Euro 2004 squad. He has won 72 caps for Germany and played in the Euro 96-winning side. \"I've had offers from Bundesliga and foreign sides as well as clubs who would have been able to pay more money than Borussia,\" said Ziege. \"But I don't want to gamble. I want to play football. After a long injury break, that is the most important thing for me. \"It's not good to pick a side only because they pay more money than everyone else.\" Borussia have been looking to boost their squad after finishing a disappointing 11th in the Bundeliga. \"I'm pleased he decided to join us,\" said Sports Director Christian Hochstatter of his new wing-back. \"Another left-footed player will certainly help us and he also adds a great deal of international experience.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
