The gloomy prospects for the high street are revealed in a survey conducted by Barclays Bank. The report, published today, says half of shop operators believe the prospects for an upturn in consumer confidence in the near future are limited. They rated the prospects for Christmas trading as \"poor or very poor\". Last year - the worst Christmas for retailers for 20 years - many store chains were forced into early markdowns to entice reluctant shoppers and clear stocks. This year most retailers have bought less Christmas stock to avoid having to push so much merchandise into the sales and preserve their margins. Health and beauty chain Boots recently doubled orders for its cheap gift ranges and slashed orders for top-of-the-range items. The Barclays survey, conducted among 180 senior retail executives, suggests prices will fall as stores shave prices to win sales. The most recent British Retail Consortium shop price data showed September prices up 0.54% compared with a year ago. However, the increase was a result of rising food prices. Non-food prices were down 0.6% on September 2004 levels. Paul Clarke, national director of Barclays retail and wholesale sectors, said: \"The results are not a surprise. These are tough times for the retail sector.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
