Goals from Markus Schopp and Igli Tare condemned Juve, who could have moved level on 29 points with Milan, to a 2-0 defeat at Brescia. The champions started the day knowing that a win would put them level on points with Milan at the top, although trailing them on goal difference. Coach Marcello Lippi left Alessandro Del Piero on the bench, opting to give Marcelo Zalayeta a rare start alongside Marco Di Vaio. Brescia, beaten 4-0 by Inter Milan at the San Siro last week, went close with an early chance - Roberto Baggio flicking an effort wide. Di Vaio should have put Juve ahead on 33 minutes but headed wide. The deadlock was almost broken shortly after the break when Schopp struck the bar. Lippi brought on Del Piero in place of Di Vaio, but the substitution failed to change the balance of the match and in the 78th minute Brescia took the lead. Defender Marco Pisano sent a high ball in from the left and Schopp rose to head home at the back post. Six minutes later Brescia doubled their advantage, Tare's left-footed volley finishing off a cross by midfielder Stephan Appiah. In the closing minutes Brescia midfielder Francelino Matuzalem was sent off for a tackle on Pavel Nedved but the home side held on to inflict Juve's first league defeat in 18 games. The last time the Italian champions lost was against Parma last March. AC Milan went top on Saturday with a 1-0 win at home to AS Roma, taking over from Lazio who let slip a 3-0 lead against Inter Milan in an exciting 3-3 draw. AC Milan's ascent came courtesy of a 73rd minute goal by striker Filippo Inzaghi, his eighth of the season. In response, Roma striker Gabriel Batistuta missed an open goal and his side's fourth defeat of the season dropped them to 11th place in the table. Lazio had stormed into a 3-0 lead over Inter Milan in the first 37 minutes thanks to a hat-trick by striker Claudio Lopez. An own-goal by defender Fernando Couto, however, gave the visitors a glimmer of hope and two spectacular long-range second half goals by Turkish midfielder Belozoglu Emre allowed Inter to grab a precious away point. Elsewhere, two goals by Parma's 20-year-old Brazilian striker Adriano gave them a comfortable 2-0 win over Reggina, while Modena and Como drew 1-1 in a clash between two of last season's promoted sides. In the other matches, Chievo and Bologna kept the Serie A leaders in sight by taking a point apiece from their goalless encounter at the Bentegodi stadium. Udinese climbed above Roma to 10th place thanks to a second-half stoppage time penalty which sealed a 2-1 win over Empoli. Vincenzo Iaquinta sent Gianluca Berti the wrong way after Francesco Pratali had handled. The bottom of the table match between Torino and Atalanta was postponed following the death of Atalanta team doctor Walter Polini. Polini was found dead in his hotel room and the Italian Football League took the decision to suspend the match immediately.
