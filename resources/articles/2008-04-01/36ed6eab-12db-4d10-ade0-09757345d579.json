The six-times champion jockey, who recently began a worldwide ban following his second positive drugs test, will be working alongside Ryan Moore, Stoute's new stable jockey and the champion rider of 2006. Moore seemed uncomfortable at the suggestion that he would benefit from the association with Fallon, who was found to have no case to answer when tried on a charge of conspiracy to defraud punters last year. \"I don't know if there'll be much of a relationship,\" said Moore. \"It's the first day I've seen him. Kieren's just riding out and obviously it'll be very helpful to get his opinion on a few of the horses. He's there to help out and I suppose he's helping himself out as well.\" Fallon was not available for comment and will, it is understood, attempt to keep a low profile during the period of his suspension, with a view to resuming his career in September 2009 at the age of 44."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
