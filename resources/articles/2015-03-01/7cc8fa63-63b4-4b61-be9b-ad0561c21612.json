I think anyone my age, having been through the bombastic whiny grunge and the underachieving \u201cshoegazing\u201d years of the late-80s/mid-90s, would have a problem with this album. The problem is simple. There is nothing untoward or particularly mediocre about this album. It ticks all the right boxes, makes all the right sounds. But what part of Blast \u2013 the fourth album in 14 years from Melbourne\u2019s beloved indie darlings Love Of Diagrams \u2013 have you heard that you haven\u2019t already heard performed before, and in a more intoxicating manner? The opening track and single Double Negative sets the scene: woozy, sequenced female vocals that are often called \u201cmesmeric\u201d; fuzzed-out guitars that chop and chide, drums hit with an economical force. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good. Music writer Ian Gittins\u2019 definition of late 80s Home Counties shoegazing \u2014 \u201csoft vocals submerged in a whirlpool of amorphous, distorted guitars\u201d \u2014 applies here. And that\u2019s the trouble. Should Love Of Diagrams be applauded for simply sticking to their guns? Double Negative is something like the shorter excursions on My Bloody Valentine\u2019s revered Isn\u2019t Anything album. As could much of Blast \u2013 Story Up, for example, with its seasick rhythms slowing down and speeding up every so often. And, much as I used to enjoy listening to Isn\u2019t Anything, I don\u2019t need to hear an Australian band in 2015 replicating it \u2013 if not note-for-note, then sound-for-sound. Of course, one has high expectations for Love Of Diagrams. Live, the band truly rock: the distorted loud guitars taking on fresh cadences of sound, the drums pounding a rhythm to the brain. Also strong is bassist Antonia Sellbach\u2019s other band, the all-female psychedelic gaze of Beaches. Thus one demands more than this faithful retread, this polite saturation of sound. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. Falling Down is a great track, taken in isolation. A wash of fury, a vortex of intoxication, a great advert for the pervading influence of Sonic Youth\u2019s seminal tour-film 1991: The Year Punk Broke. It\u2019s just that pop doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, and I can\u2019t pretend that I don\u2019t have prior knowledge. The problem is exacerbated when guitarist Luke Horton adds his voice to Selbach\u2019s. The duo seem to be going out of their way to duplicate the dreamy male-female interplay of Shields-Butchers in My Bloody Valentine. The guitars sound a little bit from column A (Sonic Youth) and a little bit from column B (MBV again, or one of their contemporaries, Ride or Swervedriver). The mediocre Photograph and In My Dream, meanwhile, are filler. The full-on guitar blister of Racing comes as too little, too late. I think I preferred it when the trio were all about the big Sonic Youth washes of sound coupled with pop aggression. The nearest they reach here is How You Run \u2013 with Horton sounding like Sonic Youth\u2019s Lee Ranaldo). Clearly the band is aiming for extra dynamics, with their choice of Chicago engineer Steve Albini to oversee production (John Lee mixed the album, back in Melbourne). But the songs don\u2019t stand apart from one another. Whether this is down to a desire to achieve a consistent overall sound, or because the songs simply aren\u2019t that strong, is hard to tell. Albini is renowned for his great live drum sound (think early PJ Harvey, Nirvana\u2019s third album) but he doesn\u2019t seem to have done drummer Monika Fikerle many favours here. The instruments, the vocals, the guitars \u2013 they\u2019re all submerged. I came expecting an equal to all-female electronic/guitar English band Electrelane. I left reminded of how lacklustre, same-y and \u2013 yes \u2013 dreary much of shoegazing sounded. \u2022 Blast is out now on Bedroom Suck"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
