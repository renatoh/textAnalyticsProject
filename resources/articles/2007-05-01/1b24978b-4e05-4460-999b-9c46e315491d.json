Birmingham had been among the division's bigger spenders during the club's previous spell in the top flight but Bruce has been informed there will be a more careful approach this time. \"I'm not going to start throwing figures around in public because we have never done that,\" said Bruce, who was informed of his playing budget when he met with the St Andrew's board for their annual board meeting this week. \"Obviously if we are going to compete at this level, we do need to strengthen. The owners recognise that and yes, there is some money available. However, I think it is more of a case of boxing clever this summer. \"When we were promoted four or five years ago, we went out and picked up a couple of diamonds in the shape of Robbie Savage and Kenny Cunningham and brought in Clinton Morrison. It is similar this time around. We need to battle and compete and get a foothold. I don't just want to make up the numbers but, at the same time, I've got to be realistic.\" Bruce has already signed Fabrice Muamba from Arsenal but he is keen to add a striker, with Andrew Cole's salary demands proving prohibitive. \"We know work is needed and we'll be in there for players who are hungry to do well for us but we may have to be cute in how we go about it,\" added the Blues manager. Reading's Steve Coppell has been named manager of the year for the second consecutive season. Coppell picked up the award - voted for by fellow managers - at the League Managers' Association awards, after guiding his team to eighth place in their first season in the top flight. Reading's squad has already been strengthened with the signing of the Boavista midfielder Kalifa Ciss\u00e9 on a three-year contract for just under \u00a31m. Roy Keane was awarded the LMA's Championship manager of the year award after guiding Sunderland to the title. Yeovil Town's Russell Slade and Hartlepool United's Danny Wilson won the League One and League Two awards respectively. Bob Bradley has been named the permanent head coach of the United States team after holding the post as a caretaker since Bruce Arena left after a disappointing World Cup last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
