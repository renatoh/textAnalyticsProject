The sequel succumbs to Hollywood inflation, cranking up the budget, volume and running time, and pitching Reeves\u2019s reluctant assassin into new forms of carnage every 15 minutes. Climaxing with a gallery shootout that underlines the films\u2019 aspirations to pop art, that carnage can feel video-gamey, yet it remains imaginatively designed and executed: Stahelski is among the few action directors whose big guns still pointedly demand reloading. The impact, however, gets muffled by extra layers of the nerdy (under)world-building through which the first movie cut such a stylish dash. Business with metaphysical ledgers and gold coins carries the none-too-thrilling whiff of accountancy; one belated cast addition returns us to the Matrix movies\u2019 tortuous footnotes. Any franchise employing Peter Serafinowicz as its Q-via-Alfred figure surely retains some sense of humour about the nonsense it\u2019s peddling, and Chapter 2 will pass a Friday or Saturday night as mindlessly as its predecessor. Yet if the third instalment \u2013 excitingly trailed here \u2013 runs much beyond two hours, stern objections should be lodged with the ombudsman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
