He and the Spaniard \u2013 who spent nearly five hours on court in three different matches \u2013 will play Joe Salisbury, who lives in Putney, and the American Rajeev Ram in the final on Sunday, not long after L\u00f3pez tries for his second singles title, at 37, against the Frenchman Gilles Simon. There was almost too much drama to take in on day six of the championships, but rarely can there have been a protagonist more suited to the heroics, a player who left Melbourne in tears in January wondering if he would ever play again and who, after radical surgery, has recovered to the point where some of his tennis is almost indistinguishable from that which brought him three majors and two Olympic gold medals. In the space of a few days, Murray has ignited hopes \u2013 only recently forlorn \u2013 that he could contend again at the highest level, certainly in doubles, and possibly in singles. At 32, there is much to play for once more. Murray said later he felt physically fine. \u201cNo pain in my hip at all, zero,\u201d he said. \u201cMy back\u2019s a bit stiff. You\u2019re getting down low for a lot of balls and you\u2019re always in a crouched-over position in doubles, more than when you\u2019re in singles. My arm is a bit tired from serving. But my hip\u2019s been brilliant so far. I don\u2019t feel anything at all. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d The semi-final was high-class and tense throughout, but the key moments were compressed into the champions tie-break, as the light faded and the temperature dropped. To get there, Murray served for the match, double-faulted and then L\u00f3pez made a mess of a close-quarters volley to take them into a shootout in the second set. The tension, already tight as a drum, spread through the Centre Court seats, as the faithful huddled against the growing chill. Mistakes were creeping into the Spaniard\u2019s game, but who could blame a player who had been on court, with a mere quarter-hour respite between his various tasks, since 4pm, as the clocked ticked on to 9pm and sunset? He\u2019d first seen off the Canadian wonder boy, Felix Auger-Aliassime in full flight, blunting his burgeoning genius over three sets. After a 12-minute break, he returned with Murray to finish their overnight match against Dan Evans and Ken Skupski \u2013 and that had its moments before they won 6-4, 7-6 (3) in an hour-and-a-quarter in total. Blessed relief for L\u00f3pez. Pausing only to warm up, they then engaged Henri Kontinen and John Peers in the semi-final. It was as if they were housed in one of the escape rooms Murray has become addicted to, where the participants have an hour to solve clues to escape. There were plenty of those moments in this semi-final. Peers, who played in two slam finals with Andy\u2019s brother, Jamie, had played well all match and served them to match point before L\u00f3pez pulled out a majestic drive down the line to get to 5-6. Murray\u2019s forehand went long on Kontinen\u2019s serve, however, and the drama was extended into the gloaming and a champions\u2019 tie-break. This was now a race to 10, with no prospect of lingering doubt. L\u00f3pez smashed a backhand volley for 6-3, as the serve switched to Peers. A mix-up cost the Spanish-Scottish pair a dumb point, but they were still 7-5 up as Murray took the ball back in hand, and he moved them to within two points of the final. The Finn saved one for 6-8, and Murray over-cooked a drive down the middle. It was down to L\u00f3pez to serve it out. His weary left arm, on second serve, took them to 9-7. He took a huge breath on the service line ... and Peers struck it wide. Job done. Glory to come? Nobody would bet against it. British supporters had already been guaranteed a home finalist when the 27-year-old Londoner Salisbury and Ram shocked the two greats of modern doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan, to win 7-6 (4), 7-6 (8) in an hour-and-a-half. Salisbury, a doubles specialist who got to the Wimbledon semi-finals last year with Frederik Nielsen, hit a career-high world ranking of 20 in April. Nothing is guaranteed at Queen\u2019s on Saturday. Asked if he would consider playing mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Maria Sharapova \u2013 who has intimated she was interested in doing so, even though they fell out over her drugs ban \u2013 Murray said, \u201cPossibly. But I haven\u2019t given it a whole lot of thought. At the time I said what I felt, and I still feel the same way about those things. That\u2019s never going to change.\u201d Next he moves on to Eastbourne where he and Marcelo Melo play the Colombian doubles wizards, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah \u2013 whom they beat here in the first round. At Wimbledon he switches to Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Every day is an adventure for Murray. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2019.
