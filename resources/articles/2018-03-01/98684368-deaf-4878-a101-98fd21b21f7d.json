Announcing American Outdoor Brands\u2019 (AOB) latest results, Debney called the shooting, which killed 17 at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, an \u201cincomprehensible loss of life\u201d but said the company would continue to support the right of Americans to carry firearms. \u201cWe share the nation\u2019s grief over this incomprehensible and senseless loss of life, and we share the desire to make our community safer,\u201d said Debney, adding the company would \u201ccontinue to support the development of effective solutions that accomplish that objective, while protecting the rights of the law-abiding firearm owner.\u201d His comments came as Debney blamed \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d for a dramatic slump in the company\u2019s profits and sales. AOB, formerly known as Smith &amp; Wesson, saw its share price collapse as it reported a $4.7m profit over the quarter compared with $37.6m a year earlier. Sales revenue fell close to a third, down to $157.4m compared with $233.5m for the same period the previous year. \u201cOur results for the third quarter reflected a continuation of challenging market conditions in the consumer market for firearms,\u201d said Debney. Like its rivals, AOB has experienced a sharp drop in sales since Donald Trump was elected president. One gun manufacturer, the 200-year-old Remington, has filed for bankruptcy. The so-called \u201cTrump slump\u201d comes after a gun-buying bonanza during the Obama presidency, when buyers feared legislation would curtail their gun-buying activity. Last month, a 19-year-old former student at the high school in Florida used a legally bought Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P 15 .223 semi-automatic rifle to kill 17 students and teachers. The killing has led to furious calls for gun reform from students at the school, some politicians, and the public. Major gun retailers including Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Walmart have changed their gun sales policies, with Dick\u2019s no longer stocking assault-style rifles and both companies raising the age for buying guns to 21. Debney, a University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology graduate who formerly ran Presto, a company making garbage bin liners and plastic wrap, is a major supporter of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the gun lobby group. Although he has admitted never having fired a gun before he took the job, Debney was awarded the NRA\u2019s Golden Ring of Freedom, a badge of honor that comes with a yellow blazer and is given only to those who have raised over a million dollars for the organization."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
