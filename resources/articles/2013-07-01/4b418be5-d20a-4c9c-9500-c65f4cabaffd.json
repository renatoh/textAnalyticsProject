Although ministers promised financial support to help vulnerable carers and disabled social housing tenants affected, the cash aid available is inadequate to meet demand and being heavily rationed, according to the charity Carers UK. As few as one in 10 carers are qualifying for ongoing support from the \u00a325m discretionary payments fund set up by the government to help disabled tenants affected by the bedroom tax. One in six of the carers interviewed by Carers UK over the first 100 days of the bedroom tax reported that they face eviction after falling behind on the rent. Three quarters of carers having to pay the tax \u2013 called the \"spare room supplement\" by ministers \u2013 said meeting the tax meant they had cut back on spending on food, electricity and heating. The study, which covered 100 carers affected by the changes, found local authorities were drawing up tight rationing criteria to eke out local discretionary support funds. One family reported that council officials had rejected their claim for support on the basis that the family were allegedly spending \u00a3100 a week on food, whereas officials deemed \u00a375 was enough to get by. The family said \u00a375 a week was equivalent in their case to a food budget of \u00a33.60 per person per day. Councils have been asking applicants to fill in long forms detailing household expenditure. Although some carers were receiving help for up to 12 months many were getting assistance for just a few weeks, after which they would be asked to re-apply for help. Under the bedroom tax, introduced for social housing tenants in April, households deemed to be \"under-occupying\" their homes face spare room penalties of up to \u00a3700 a year. Households who cannot afford to make up the shortfall face having to move, although in many areas no suitable smaller homes are available, forcing tenants to take the financial hit. The government's own impact assessment estimates 420,000 disabled tenants are affected by the bedroom tax. Helena Herklotz, chief executive of Carers UK, said the policy was having a \"shocking\" impact on families already struggling to care for disabled relatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
