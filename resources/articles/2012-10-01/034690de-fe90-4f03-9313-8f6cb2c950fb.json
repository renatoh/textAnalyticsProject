Ga\u00ebl Fickou is only 18 years old and, facially, looks not unlike the England forward Courtney Lawes. When he runs he moves with the balletic grace, pace and balance of a Jeremy Guscott. A French version of Jeremy Guscott? This really is the point at which top-level rugby and fantasy football merge into one. Such players normally materialise only in an attack coach's wildest imagination. If Monsieur Fickou can stay fit, he has all the makings of a global superstar. Even his opponents are already cooing. \"He's the next Wesley Fofana, isn't he?\" observed Leicester's Toby Flood. \"He looks fantastic. He's big, he's rangy, he's going to fill out further and he's got good acceleration. He's certainly one to watch.\" Having already polished the gleaming jewel that was Yannick Jauzion, Toulouse also know how to nurture such prodigious talents. The game as a whole should be grateful. Only twice previously in my press box-dwelling, splinter-collecting career have I seen a young centre who has stood out to the same spectacular extent. Both Guscott and Brian O'Driscoll went on to have half-decent careers and it is hard to believe Fickou will not do the same. Ga\u00ebl force indeed. It revives memories of the first time I saw Guscott play, away at London Irish's old ground in Sunbury circa 1985. People tend to overuse the phrase \"poetry in motion\" but in this case it was entirely accurate. The coltish pretender did not so much run as glide, an occasional swing of the hips leaving defenders utterly confounded. He knew he was good, too, which added an additional frisson. Fickou, to judge from his cheerful post-match demeanour, also looks a thoroughly decent kid. Toulon must be kicking themselves for letting him slip away but just imagine the warm, pleasurable sensation Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 must be feeling. Fofana, Fickou, Maxime Mermoz \u2026 France suddenly have gifted young centres oozing from every pore at a time when English rugby cannot seem to rear any blemish-free homegrown 12s. Is this mere coincidence? The French Top 14, as we know, is hardly a free-flowing try-fest. There are dozens of long-striding, free-running centres worldwide who have their X-factor knocked out of them by the age of 21. Fickou was born in 1994, which makes him too young to have seen the likes of Denis Charvet or Didier Codorniou in the flesh. But whereas Guscott was a virtual one-off in an environment which churned out considerably more bashers than artistes, Fickou appears to be the latest descendant of a rich heritage. For some reason France do not seem capable of producing many world champion fly-halves \u2013 too much responsibility, too fearful of letting their gargantuan forwards down, too many coaches preferring to use their scrum-halves as the tactical hub? \u2013 but they have cornered the market in languid midfield sorcerers as no other country, New Zealand included. The nearest athletic English equivalent to Fickou in recent times, one could argue, is Delon Armitage, the best No13 the English national team have never had. And where did Delon spend his formative rugby days? Why, in the south of France at Racing Club de Nice. Instead of basing their new elite talent-honing academy near Reading, perhaps the Rugby Football Union should send them all to the C\u00f4te d'Azur for six months. Then again maybe Fickou is simply a once-in-a-generation player who, like Guscott, would have made it regardless of nationality but I am not entirely convinced. Toulouse dropped a lot of ball in damp conditions against Leicester on Sunday but the lofty ambition of their inter-passing was in a different league from much of what passes for midfield trickery in the Premiership. So was their speed of thought. When Thomas Waldrom spilt the ball 45 metres from his own posts on Sunday, most opposing players would simply have hacked it blindly forwards. Not Fickou. He had the presence of mind not merely to pick it up in one lithe movement but to kick it immediately into a space he had identified in the previous split-second. After that his pace took him past several trailing Leicester players, who were still mentally adjusting to the fact Waldrom had lost possession. This, remember, was the young man's Heineken Cup debut. No fear, no hesitation, no boundaries. Genuinely ambitious young British three-quarters should consider adopting a similar creed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
