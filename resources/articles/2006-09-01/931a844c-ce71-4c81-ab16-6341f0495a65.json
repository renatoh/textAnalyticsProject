But a smattering of takeover talk and another strong performance from mining stocks helped the market recover from its worst levels. By the close the FTSE 100 index was 4.9 points lower at 5981.7, having fallen to 5956 at one point. Property group Hammerson was the biggest loser in the leading index, down 33p to \u00a312.81 as profit-takers moved in after Monday's results. British Land and Slough Estates were also under pressure, down 20p to \u00a313.72 and 16p to 648.5p respectively, while disappointing figures yesterday from rival Brixton saw its shares lose 13.25p to 525p. Sentiment was also dented by signs of slower growth in the service sector as reported in the latest purchasing managers' index. Traders said there were also worrying indications of inflationary pressures in the report. The Centre for Economics and Business Research said the survey was unlikely to influence the Bank of England's interest rate decision tomorrow, which is expected to see rates frozen at 4.75% after August's surprise increase. But the CEBR added: \"The news will put the [Bank] in a quandary as to the timing of their next expected rise in rates.\" On the upside, dealers were busy dusting off a number of takeover tales. Centrica, owner of British Gas, was 5.75p higher at 308.25p on hopes that Gazprom would finally make a predatory move, despite recent denials, while its former other half, BG, was up 6.5p at 690.5p on talk that either Royal Dutch Shell or the French group Total could be interested. Oil services groups Abbot and John Wood were in demand on hopes of consolidation in the sector. Wood climbed 9p to 244.5p and Abbot 5.75p to 295.75p after French energy services group Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de G\u00e9ophysique said it was paying $3.1bn (\u00a31.6bn) for Texas-based Veritas DGC, which supplies survey information to major oil businesses. Nickel and copper prices moved higher, helping lift Kazakhmys 44p to \u00a313.31 and Rio Tinto 49p to \u00a328.24. Today comes the quarterly rejig of the leading indices and, on current form, insurers Standard Life and Resolution are likely to join the FTSE 100, replacing Rentokil Initial and Schroders. Standard closed 1.5p higher at 268.5p but Resolution slipped 2p to 596p. Meanwhile Bradford &amp; Bingley building society received its promotion yesterday, replacing BOC, which has been taken over by Germany's Linde. B&amp;B's shares added 1.5p to 476.5p. Good results from equipment hire group Ashtead lifted its shares 16p to 148p. Ashtead said first-quarter profits had almost doubled to \u00a324.3m. Cazenove put an outperform rating on the shares, while UBS said the results were well ahead of expectations. There were mixed fortunes for two leading companies due to report results this week. PartyGaming fell 2.75p to 116.5p ahead of figures due tomorrow, when it will update the market on its move into the sports betting market. But DSG - the company formerly known as Dixons - was 2p better at 209.75p. It is due to announce results today. Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the water group Severn Trent from \u00a312.90 to \u00a312.55, helping push the shares down 21p to \u00a313.10. Lower down the market, electronics group Filtronic added 15p to 210p after it revised the terms of a deal to sell its wireless infrastructure to the US business Powerwave. Investors had been concerned about recent falls in Powerwave's share price, which reduced the value of the cash and share deal to Filtronic. Now Filtronic is to receive $185m in cash and 17.7m shares, rather than $150m in cash and 20.7m shares. John Menzies fell 17.75p to 476p after underlying half-year profits fell 7%. Its aviation division showed strong growth but its magazine and newspaper distribution business struggled with falling consumer demand, particularly for monthly magazines and partworks. Shore Capital downgraded its recommendation from hold to sell, saying: \"We believe the long-term future of the group now very much depends on the aviation division. We are concerned about the drag the distribution business will have on group performance.\" Premier Foods added 5p to 260p as it confirmed reports it may buy part of United Biscuits' UK and Irish business. UK Coal edged up 0.25p to 209p as property group Peel Land lifted its stake in the company to 21.03%. UK Coal is expected to report today it has moved back into the black to the tune of \u00a37m. Among small companies, Intec Telecom Systems was up 1.5p at 38.5p with volumes reaching nearly 17m against 2m on a normal day. Last month the software specialist issued a profits warning and some traders believe a predator is weighing up a move on the company. Finally, there was the Aim debut of Aquabella, which specialises in farming barramundi, which are apparently white-fleshed Australian fish which the company sells to the wholesale and restaurant market in Britain. It raised \u00a32.3m in a placing of shares at 100p. By the close the shares had reached 101.5p. Raising cairn Oil explorer Cairn Energy yesterday announced a delay in the start-up of its important Mangala field in India and also a 74% drop in half-year pre-tax profits and a slip in oil production. It tried to lessen the disappointment by saying it was on track to float its Indian operations in December. This worked to some degree, since after an initial fall the shares closed 9p higher at \u00a321.25. Bruce Evers, oil analyst with Investec Securities, said he was disappointed by the delays at Mangala and the lack of information on the initial public offering in India. \"This is the third delay and they are not saying exactly when the field will come on stream in 2009. People hoped that they would go for a majority [stake] sell down and there is less detail than we would have liked.\" nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
