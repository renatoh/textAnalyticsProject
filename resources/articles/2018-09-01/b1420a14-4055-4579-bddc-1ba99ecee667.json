I deeply regret this,\u201d Thomas Borgen said in his resignation statement on Wednesday. The bank said an independent investigation had found \u201ca series of major deficiencies\u201d in its controls to prevent money laundering. The investigation found that more than half of Danske\u2019s 15,000 customers in Estonia were suspicious. \u201cWe have gone through 6,200 customers starting with the customers hitting most risk indicators first,\u201d the bank said. \u201cAlmost all of these customers have been reported to the authorities.\u201d The investigation found that several dozen of its employees may have colluded with customers to get around background and security checks. The bank said it had reported some of its employees and former employees to the Estonian police. The bank\u2019s chairman, Ole Andersen, said the scandal was a \u201ca deplorable matter\u201d. \u201cThe findings of the investigations point to some very unacceptable and unpleasant matters at our Estonian branch, and they also point to the fact that a number of controls at the group level were inadequate in relation to Estonia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take the task of combating financial crime and money laundering very seriously, and we do and will do everything it takes to ensure that we never find ourselves in the same situation again.\u201d Danske only admitted to the true extent of the money laundering scandal on Wednesday following increasing political pressure and US law enforcement agencies this week launching an investigation. Borgen, who was in charge of Danske\u2019s international operations (including Estonia) before he became CEO in 2013, had previously dismissed other executives\u2019 concerns about Russian transactions in Estonia. In a 2010 investigation Borgen said he had not \u201ccome across anything that could give rise to concern\u201d. The independent report by Danish law firm Bruun &amp; Hjejle on Wednesday found that under Borgen\u2019s leadership the Estonian branch had failed to disclosure the full situation to Danske\u2019s board. Borgen said on Wednesday that the law firm had not found him to have breached the law. \u201cEven though the investigation conducted by the external law firm concludes that I have lived up to my legal obligations, I believe that it is best for all parties that I resign,\u201d he said. Estonia\u2019s Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) said it was examining the findings of the investigation. \u201cThe report describes serious shortcomings in the organisation of Danske Bank, where risk appetite and risk control were not in balance,\u201d Kilvar Kessler, the chairman of the Estonian FSA, said. Bill Browder, a US hedge fund manager who has been leading a crusade against corruption and money laundering by rich and powerful Russians, has claimed that Danske\u2019s Estonian branch was involved in the fraud uncovered by his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russia jail. Danske said it would donate all its profits earned from the suspicious accounts between 2007 and 2015 to a charity focused on \u201ccombating international financial crime\u201d. The donation totals 1.5bn Danish kroner (\u00a3178m). Analysts expect Danske to be fined billions of dollars by Danish, European and US regulators. Dutch bank ING earlier this month paid a \u20ac775m fine to settle an investigation that it had failed to detect money laundering. Last year Deutsche Bank was fined almost $700m for helping wealthy Russians move about $10bn out of the country. Credit rating agency Standard and Poor\u2019s has warned Denmark that the scandal may lead it to cutting the country\u2019s AAA credit rating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
