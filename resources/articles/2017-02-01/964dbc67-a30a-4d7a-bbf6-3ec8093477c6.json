While the change in climate has been hardly noticeable to humans, it has made an enormous difference to the floating pennywort, Hydrocotyle ranunculoide, which already threatens to choke slow-moving rivers and the Broads. The extension of warmer weather into autumn has give this semi-tropical South American plant the opportunity to produce viable seeds for the first time enabling it to spread even faster. In summer, pennywort forms dense mats on the surface of rivers such as the Cam and Great Ouse, making boating difficult, shading the native water plants and reducing fish populations. Attempts to eradicate it by physically hauling it out of the water have been defeated because the tiniest speck left in the river regrows at alarming speed. Herbicides also fail to kill it. The pennywort\u2019s new ability to produce viable seed was spotted by Jonathan Newman, an aquatic weeds researcher, who has spent 20 years unsuccessfully trying to find a way to kill it but watched in some admiration as it has mutated and grown stronger. The weather will soon be warm enough for the seeds produced last autumn to germinate so the river authorities in East Anglia are anxiously monitoring the situation, fearing a renewed population explosion. But as in the best science-fiction films, an antidote has been found that could tame the beast. A hungry South American weevil that only eats pennywort awaits government approval for its release."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
