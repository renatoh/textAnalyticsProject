Imperialism is not the highest stage of capitalism - fashion is. Fashion is about showing people stuff they don't know they want and haven't even thought of, convincing them that they are actually desperate for it, and then fleecing them. Fashion is also intensely, brilliantly creative and innovative and mad and before Tuesday I knew nothing about it at all. I used to. I have enjoyed episodic brief independent moments of fashion, when I too made statements. At 13 I wore brown hipsters and a gold shirt with epaulettes; at 18 I had an old RAF greatcoat and desert boots. Now I just buy what my partner tells me to, which is almost nothing. Going to London Fashion Week, therefore, was something of an act of rebellion. I could come back and advise her what she ought to be wearing. At the same time I could get a handle on an event that sells magazines, fills supplements and brightens news pages. Off to Chelsea I went, to a marquee on the site of a former army barracks, ominously close to Sloane Square. Milieu The people gathering around the various entrances to the main tents were not the bonkers exhibitionists I was hoping for. There were a few minor eccentricities: a rather self-conscious man with a bonsai tree on his head was accompanied by a woman wearing the 10ft tail feather of the great auk. But most wore just one item of fashionware in otherwise staid outfits: a leather pork-pie hat with a corduroy jacket, a full-face balaclava with a blouse and slacks. Black predominated and accessories were adventurous, especially bags. I saw one woman with a very attractive shoulder pack, which was all zips and padding. But then she fed it, and I realised it was a baby. There were no straight men. Actually there weren't even that many gay men. But there were vast numbers of women, mostly of the same age and class, a sort of gigantic all-girl's grammar school reunion for the 28 to 40s. As a result of this gender imbalance I noticed three things. The first is that several hundred women together creates a vast amount of ambulant hair; a psychologically troubling quantity of hair, in fact. The second is that men, being taller, stand out like mountain peaks above the keratinous clouds. And the third is that - when they are in a majority - women will shamelessly commandeer the mens' loos. There may be some men who like this, but I am not one of them. Modalities Eventually you are allowed to enter the tents, which are policed by an army of security guards. I counted 11 sentries at one entrance alone. They are presumably trained to deal with attacks by fundamentalist gatecrashers. For the interested, this year's security chic consists of a black, double-breasted blazer with gilt buttons done up awkwardly over the paunch, stained charcoal-grey trousers, scuffed shoes of various makes and vintages, and a special tie with the company logo tastefully woven at navel level. Once your ticket has gained you entry to the tents you wait in a vestibule. Or, if the show is being held in east London, or the City, or the West End (as several are) you travel to the venue, and wait there, sometimes in a hallway and sometimes outside in the freezing bloody cold. Everything is always late. My first show of the day was due to begin at 10.45am, but got under way at 11.20am. By late afternoon the 3.45 pm display had still not begun at 5pm. The Brits take this in their stride and - knowing that tardiness governs all - they gradually arrive later and later. What, after all, is the point in turning up late, just to find that you are early? So the show starts even later, because you don't want to begin without your audience. It drives the Americans and some of the Europeans completely round the bend. After Eley Kishimoto kept a long queue of fashion persons stood in an icy wind along Threadneedle Street, I heard vengeful foreigners promising bad reviews. Right, they are letting us in. In theory our ticket entitles us to a seat on either side of the catwalk (or runway as we anti-sexists call it), and PR-women patrol the room with clip-boards containing names, affiliations and seat-rows. As the venue fills up, however, it becomes a case of sit-qui-peut, and mutterings, hijackings and shufflings break out. As this happens loud music with a heavy bass begins to play, probably to drown out the complaints. The rake of the seats is not great, which means that it can be hard for people to see the runway. At my first show a woman sat in front of me. She had blonde hair and high cheekbones and could have been the model called Caprice, or one of her younger sisters: Whim, perhaps, or even Careless. She also wore a coat with an Ivan the Terrible collar that completely obscured the view on either side of her head. Hierarchies Had I been one of the top people of fashion this could not have happened to me. The powerful are sat in the front seats, with a fantastic view up the models' skirts. Starting at the pinnacle are any celebrities who turn up. I was rather hoping for Gwyneth, Christina or Jackie O (and then I remembered the dreadful news), and was mildly disappointed when a camera flurry turned out to be for Jennifer Saunders. Next come the Yanks. They write for magazines and newspapers that sell to millions of rich women, so their good opinions are very much sought after. I had pointed out to me the green-coated, orange-shirted, flop-haired European editor of American Vogue, Hamish Bowles. Next to him was New York Times fashion critic, Cathy Horyn and the strangely coiffured Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune. The minor nobility are the fashion editors of the British nationals, whose number twos sit in the row behind them, a little like parliamentary private secretaries in the House of Commons. The editors are joined by a couple of tolerated eccentrics, like the woman who has Edna Everage glasses, a coypu on her head, and a much younger male protege by her side. In rows three, four and five you will find the merchant classes: trade journalists, buyers for minor stores, persuasive liggers (the unpersuasive ones are still outside in Threadneedle Street), friends, family and hacks writing sarcastic colour features. Between them, squeezed in at the back and sitting in the gangways are the apprentices, the fashion students who, every time they stand up to try and get a look are met with cries of \"Down! Down! Down!\" The lowest of the low are the photographers, who stand at one end, arranged on ladders and boxes in a precarious pyramid, from which their faces and lenses peer out as from a pile of skulls. It is odd that the photographers are so under-valued, given that - without them - there is no show. Mind you, they come prepared for hardship. One grey-haired Japanese woman was dressed for a photoshoot on the north face of the Eiger, covered head to foot in Helly Hanson waterproofs, with crampons in her pocket. The models The main lights go down, the runway lights come up, the music becomes more purposeful and on strides the first model. And now you make contact with an alien world. A world in which aliens live. The models at the shows I went to do not look like human beings, but rather like beautiful wispy things from another universe. First, they have no groins - their legs never actually meeting. These limbs just carry on and eventually end at the shoulders. Breasts (where they bother) have been sharpened. Noses are big this year, and I'm happy with that. The models wear expressions of mild irritation and never smile, which is just as well because there is no room on their faces for anything as large as a smile. The shortest model is, by my calculation, around 6ft 7in tall. Most are over 7ft, though I may be mistaken here. They walk in an inhuman way. The most successful lean back, their chins parallel to the floor, but their bodies sloping forwards in a diagonal, their incredibly long arms hanging down. From this position their legs are brought crashing on to the runway. It all suggests the early stages of a limbo dance as performed by the Welsh Guards. As one heads for home, another appears. On the narrow catwalks there must be less than a quarter of an inch of clearance between the two passing models. You expect them to acknowledge each other, like cab or bus drivers, but they never do. They crash on to the end. The reason for this unnatural walk is very simple. The photos are all taken from the front, and what looks bizarre from east or west makes a great picture when seen from the north. In fact, if the position of the cameras was changed, we'd probably need a different shape of model, walking in a completely different way. At the end of my first show I was sure that I'd counted four different models, all of whom must have changed clothes very quickly. Then they came out to take a last walk, and I saw that there were 13. Troubling. The clothes Now to the bit you've all been waiting for - my expert appreciation of the clothes. Well, I liked them. They were sensible and pretty. True, I didn't go to Jean Muir because I was told that she was dead, so that seemed like a waste of time. Eley Kishimoto started with gowns and mortar boards, creating a look that might be described as \"satanic academic\", and then followed it up with lots of pretty dresses in bright colours. So you may want to buy one of those. I wasn't sure, though, about the paper flower the size of a dustbin lid, but I guess that's optional. Emma Cook and Betty Jackson were next - both names sounded like friends of your mother, who she tells you on the phone have just had strokes or hysterectomies. Emma Cook's dresses were quite nice, as were her pink pyjamas. Jackson worried me by combining a frayed brown woollie with tiny hotpants, to create an image of long, thick pubic hair that I think will stay with me forever. Still the woman from the Telegraph liked it."}, "isHosted": false}}}
