Let me start the list: Stephen Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Chris Tremlett... These men must have been scowling on Friday morning as clouds enveloped Headingley and the South African pacemen went about their business. But now they have been reminded of the benefits of not being in the England team; in their absence their stock rises. They have done no wrong. Meanwhile those who have been selected to bowl for England are causing their employers a headache. If nothing else think of the cost. All those new balls are expensive. For the second South African innings in succession a third shiny red ball has been removed from its wrapper. As one wry new ball wag once observed after another run glut: \"we must be onto the colours soon.\" Maybe we have all got it wrong. Geoff Miller and his selectors have pulled off a masterstroke of long-term planning by plucking out Darren Pattinson. Perhaps he has made the normally equable Harmison hopping mad. During this Test match Harmison has bowled Durham to victory in the Championship match against Surrey. Yesterday he snaffled four Middlesex wickets in the Pro40. Just one problem: if Harmison were to be recalled, it will probably be to a weary England side, which is 1-0 down in the series. There were few positives to be found - though the modern cricketer can always find one or two whatever has happened - among those playing in this Test. Andrew Flintoff did not break down. He delivered 40 economical overs without any obvious ill effects. Progress. Monty Panesar, who escaped with very respectable figures, bowled the slowest over - in terms of mph - of his Test career as he sought to lure the South African tail. He also delivered an arm-ball. It wasn't a very good arm-ball but at least he was prepared to try one. And of course Flintoff took a stupendous catch at first slip to remove the adhesive AB de Villiers. Flintoff barely smiled once the ball had stuck in his left hand, since this moment of brilliance could not change the balance of power a jot. It was like a golfer producing an eagle during a round of 83. For this was another dire day for an England side, which has been pragmatically ground into the dust by Ashwell Prince and de Villiers. They bowled reasonably well and still they could not take wickets. So the problems mount: Tim Ambrose, de Villiers' opposite number, does not feel like a number six. Stuart Broad's youthful limbs are starting to creak. His batting is just the job but his bowling is more fragile. He is looking in need of a rest. Darren Pattinson has not disgraced himself on his debut but his presence here has undermined the credibility of the England hierarchy. Meanwhile the South Africans are gaining in confidence. The team is scoring runs plentifully and Jacques Kallis hasn't got going yet. Makhaya Ntini, a notoriously slow starter of a Test series, was back on track in the final session on Sunday. England require an innings on the scale of that produced by Mike Atherton in Johannesburg in 1995. Odds against."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
