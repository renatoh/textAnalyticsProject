The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection across the region stands at 305. This week, Fiji and New Zealand joined 13 of their neighbours in declaring themselves virus-free. New Zealand\u2019s successful eradication of Covid-19 led the Cook Islands to relax its travel ban slightly between the two countries, allowing workers and residents to enter. Some in the Pacific are hoping the drop in case numbers could lead to a restarting of tourism, but others are still fearful, mindful of limited public health infrastructure in the region \u2013 and globally, no vaccine. Hundreds of cruise ship workers, most of whom had been stuck in isolation for months on board empty ships, were finally flown back to Fiji and Vanuatu by their employer, Carnival Australia. The economic downturn continues to bite. This week, the Samoa Times, founded 19 years ago, was forced to close due to the Covid-19 crisis. What has happened this week? CNMI: The Marianas recorded two more positive cases last week, and then another asymptomatic case on Tuesday. This raises the total to 28. All three arrived from Guam, but originated from the United States. Guam: The WHO has recorded 171 confirmed cases with five deaths. This is an increase of five cases from last week. West Papua: The Jakarta Post reports there have been 1,243 cases in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Nine people have died. The government of Papua New Guinea last week agreed to open its borders to 30 PNG nationals who had been held since January by Indonesian authorities. Indonesian officials said 25 had been convicted of crimes, and five were overstayers. Papua New Guinea: The country remains stable at eight reported cases, but concerns are still high, especially considering the situation on its porous western border with Indonesia. The governor of East Sepik, Allan Bird, has called on the government to collect local data about the effects of Covid-19, citing a study in that province that showed 4% of 1,100 people tested had Covid-19 antibodies in their bloodstream, despite no one in the region testing positive for Covid-19 during the state of emergency. French Pacific Territories: There are 20 recorded cases in New Caledonia, with no new infections recorded since last week. The most recent case, a police officer, arrived in Noumea in mid-May. He tested negative prior to departure. In French Polynesia, the number of cases remains unchanged from last week, at 60. The leader of French Polynesia\u2019s largest church has joined a chorus demanding that rotation of officials from France be suspended. Travellers from virus-free Wallis and Futuna are the first people to travel to New Caledonia without undergoing quarantine. Fiji: With 18 infections all cleared up, and no new cases in a month and a half, the nation has declared itself virus-free. A curfew remains in place between 10pm and 5am. Schools will reopen on 30 June. Solomon Islands: The first four Covid-19 tests to be carried out in-country all came back negative. The country remains under a state of emergency until 25 July. Government data reveals that tourist arrivals into the country fell nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2020, with only 752 people coming in to the country during March. Vanuatu: The country is still virus-free, and is focused now on repatriation efforts. A Radio Australia report suggests that over 7,000 Vanuatu citizens and residents are waiting to return home. The bulk of them are seasonal workers in Australia and New Zealand, but hundreds were trapped while traveling casually, and risk overstaying temporary visas. Marshall Islands: Community pressure continues for the government to ease the requirement that container ships undergo 14 days quarantine before having their cargo unloaded. The quarantine requirements are leading to fresh produce being spoiled and putting up costs. Cook Islands: Citizens and work permit holders who have been in New Zealand for a period of at least 30 days will be allowed to return to Cook Islands as of 15 June. What are Pacific governments doing? Papua New Guinea: The country is still treating the virus as a live threat. Parliament voted by 80-2 to extend the state of emergency to 16 June. Schools have resumed but there are serious challenges caused by social distancing requirements and lack of resources. The government received another US$600,000 worth of personal protective equipment, or PPE, as well as six new ventilators. New Caledonia: Anti-independence members of the French National Assembly have castigated the government in Noumea for accepting what they called a usurious $US270m loan from the French Development Agency. They warned that repayment terms would stifle attempts to get the local economy back on its feet, and widen the economic divide between rich and poor. Fiji: The government last week declared the nation officially virus-free. Fuelling rising hopes that the tourism sector might be resurrected, a survey of Americans listed Fiji in third place among countries they would most like to visit when borders reopen. Vanuatu: The Australian government is providing more than A$4.3m in assistance to help Vanuatu roll out its own massive bailout package. The money will be spent on improving underresourced financial administrative systems in order to speed the processing and delivery of funds. Samoa: The associate minister for health has been accused of breaching restrictions on social gatherings after a video emerged, apparently showing more than five people had attended an open house. Tofa Li\u2019o Foleni denied the allegations, insisting that only five people had been invited. The rest of the people present were his children, he said. French Polynesia: With borders reopening to tourists, the territory announced a number of requirements for visitors. These include a negative test no more than 72 hours prior to departure, or an immunity certificate showing a successful recovery. Marshall Islands: The Marshall Islands Journal reports that the government has approved a $6m Covid-19 economic relief program to support local businesses. Australia and New Zealand The number of confirmed cases for New Zealand remains unchanged from last week at 1,154 with 22 deaths. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced on Monday that her nation had successfully eliminated Covid-19, but warned \u201celimination is not a point in time, it is a sustained effort\u201d. The country has lifted all restrictions domestically, but its borders remain closed. In Australia, the number of active cases stands at 7,260, which is an increase of 58 from last week. There have been 102 deaths. Tens of thousands in Australia and New Zealand braved the virus threat to march in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movements. Large numbers of Pacific islanders attended, many highlighting the legacy of racism toward them. Australia\u2019s minister for the Pacific, Alex Hawke, was dismissive, calling the marchers \u201cself-indulgent\u201d. What did they say? In many Pacific Small Island Developing States ... imported foods constitute half of a person\u2019s food intake. If the pandemic continues, and the global and local supply chain \u2013 from production, processing, export, transportation to import \u2013 is affected, it will disrupt the region\u2019s food systems. \u2013 Eriko Hibi, FAO sub-regional coordinator for the Pacific and representative to 13 Pacific states Good news The Solomon Islands government has waived examination fees for all students in forms five and six, citing the economic hardships associated with Covid-19. In Vanuatu the minister for finance, Johnny Koanapo, has announced that all small and medium enterprises that have business licences will receive a one-off stimulus grant of VT60,000 (A$733). Infection and fatality figures in this article are valid as of 8 June. They are based on WHO daily situation reports, and supplemented in some cases by national government updates. Inconsistencies in running sum totals may result because of reconciliations in country totals, and revisions of previous data."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
