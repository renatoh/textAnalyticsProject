England's rock'n'roll heritage", "bodyText": "Want to pay homage at the pub where Arctic Monkeys played their first gig (the Grapes in Sheffield)? Or pay your respects at the scene of Marc Bolan's death (a sycamore tree in Barnes, west London)? Then what you need is the new England Rocks Map, which reveals the location of more than 100 sites of musical significance around the country. It has been launched by Visit Britain as part of a campaign marketing England's rock'n'roll heritage alongside its stately homes, countryside and cities. There are special sections on The Smiths (encouraging visitors to head to Salford Lads Club, Southern Cemetery, and, er, Strangeways Prison) and the Beatles (from the Cavern to 20 Forthlin Road, the National Trust-owned 1950s terraced house where the McCartney family used to live). The level of detail is admirable - Pulp fans, for example, can even find the market where a young Jarvis learnt his poetic sensibilities while working on a wet fish stall. And yet, even the most devoted fan might be a little disappointed when they get to some of the locations. Paul Weller fans are directed to Stanley Road, his former home in Woking, Surrey. What they'll find is a giant office block built there in the 1980s.
