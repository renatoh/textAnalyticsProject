When the wind blows, the sails spin, but climb the external stairs to find bedrooms, kitchen, dining room and balconies overlooking the north-west Aegean. There are no neighbours here on 'broken pottery beach'. Go snorkelling in the crystal-clear water watched only by the umbrella palms, or travel inland where you are more likely to stumble across Alonissosians dressed traditionally in black, or the tinkling of bells heralding the proximity of goats and their herd, than other tourists. Patitiri, the island's only town, which is actually more of a village, is 15 minutes away by car. Cost: From \u00a3482-\u00a3708 per person for a week (based on four sharing), including flights, hydrofoil and car hire. Contact: Greek Islands Club (020 8232 9780).
