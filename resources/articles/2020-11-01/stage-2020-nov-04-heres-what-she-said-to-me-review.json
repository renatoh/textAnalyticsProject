The story begins in Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1957, three years before the nation\u2019s independence. The actors travel through the next six decades playing three women down the generations, but also switching between a panoply of family members around them, from inspiring grandmothers and stern husbands to spirited daughters whose confidence and hope, as girls, is yet unbroken. It is a beguiling way to stage a family saga even if it leaves its actors with a burden. They rise to it on the whole, switching fluidly from direct address to dialogue, from English to Yoruba, and incorporating dance, song and mime in thrilling ways, though their changes between characters lack clarity in moments and feel a little dizzying. Oladipo Agboluaje\u2019s script captures the women\u2019s romances, achievements and dashed hopes. Mistakes are repeated down the generations, but there are gains too. Agbeke (Ayo-Dele Edwards) is pushed towards a life of learning and independence by her grandmother, but falls into a destructive marriage instead. \u201cYou must remember I was in love,\u201d she says by way of apology for her wrong turning. Her daughter, Omotola, (Estella Daniels) gets further in her education, travelling to England for it, but her greater ambitions are also curbed by marriage. She in turn urges her daughter, Aramide (Kik\u00e9 Brimah), to strive for a bigger, better existence as a British-Nigerian woman. Powerful scenes enact different forms of compromise or coercive control within marriage, though we are whisked out of these a little too quickly and at the most critical moments. We stay longer on Agbeke\u2019s bigamous marriage in which she comes up against a younger, combative second wife, and feel more emotionally connected to her as a result. Unlike the more comic treatment of bigamy in The Secret Lives of Baba Segi\u2019s Wives, the story here is stark, stunting Agbeke\u2019s life and leaving great trauma, even when she seeks comfort in traditional faith healing. Beautifully directed by Mojisola Elufowoju, music and movement become metabolised within the story, and ingenious ways are found to stage a moment of intimacy, a mother\u2019s death and a child\u2019s rape. Some scenes are built through Rob Hart\u2019s crisp sound design \u2013 the chimes of Big Ben, the burbling of a stream, the rumble of a London commuter train \u2013 and Andy Purves\u2019s lighting saturates the stage with atmosphere and mood. Props are used inventively , with one breathtaking moment when a sheet becomes a river, and then a swaddling baby. Alongside its central theme of womanhood, there is a sensitive exploration of cultural identity, migration and the meaning of \u201chome\u201d as the family moves between Nigeria and Britain. We are told at the beginning of \u201cthe bond between the living and the ancestors\u201d, and Agbeke stands by the side of the stage, long after her death, casting a protective eye over her family\u2019s women and sending strength in their moments of need. \u2022 Online until 14 November and returning on 1 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
