Leicester find themselves top of the table and 13 points clear of Manchester United in sixth place after a miraculous campaign that has defied all rational expectation. It is now more than 15 years since they were knocked out of the Uefa Cup in the first round by Red Star Belgrade having won the League Cup the previous season, with the majority of the intervening period spent outside the top flight. Only the midfielder Andy King remains from the side who achieved promotion from League One in 2009 during Nigel Pearson\u2019s first spell at the club. But having surpassed his initial target of 40 points at the start of January, Ranieri knows history is now within their grasp \u2013 even if talk of the title remains strictly taboo. \u201cFor me the favourites are the others still, of course,\u201d he said, repeating the mantra of the past few weeks. \u201cWe have to fight and just at the end we can say: \u2018Oh, we achieved this, we are in the Europa League, how fantastic.\u2019 Or: \u2018We are in the Champions League, amazing.\u2019 \u201cNow we are fighting to achieve the Europa League, you imagine [if] Leicester achieve the Europa League and next season we stay in the Europa League? Unbelievable. That is our goal. When we achieve this, I look how many matches left. \u201cMaybe we can achieve Champions League \u2013 wow, amazing. Europa League is the next little step. Little targets is the match: Newcastle. After, Crystal Palace, that is our step.\u201d When asked at which point he would consider Leicester favourites for the title, Ranieri said: \u201cWhen we have a five-point lead with less than one match [remaining]. When the mathematics say yes, that is it. Believe me, we have won our title by saving the team [from relegation].\u201d Ranieri has every reason for remaining so circumspect. His previous job in charge of Greece ended in the sack following a disastrous defeat by the Faroe Islands and, after 15 other managerial posts since his career began at the Italian amateur side Vigor Lamezia in 1986, the 64-year-old is fully aware just how fickle football can be. He was certainly full of sympathy for Steve McClaren, who was finally relieved of his duties at Newcastle on Friday after almost a week in limbo. The news still had not been confirmed when Ranieri addressed the media the previous day, although the writing was very much already on the wall for the former England manager at that stage. So now, instead of facing a side overseen by McClaren, Ranieri and Leicester will come up against one buoyed by the appointment of Rafael Ben\u00edtez as his successor. \u201cIt is a difficult match because they are in a dangerous position,\u201d said Ranieri, who, like Ben\u00edtez, has previously managed Chelsea, Valencia, Napoli and Internazionale. \u201cI can\u2019t believe why because there are so many good players and they have spent more than \u00a3100m. \u201cI think it will be a difficult match because they are fighting to survive. They have to win here, if they want to believe to be safe they have to win here and we must be very focused on this. Sometimes they play well and sometimes down. I can\u2019t understand but I am sure on Monday night it will be a battle and it is important we understand this. I want to see my players fight for every ball.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
