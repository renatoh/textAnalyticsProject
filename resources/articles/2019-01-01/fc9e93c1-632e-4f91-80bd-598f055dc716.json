The Harris county sheriff\u2019s office has said it is working on a number of leads. It has released grainy images of a red pickup truck captured by a CCTV camera as well as a sketch of the suspect, thought to be a thin white male in his 30s or 40s. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find him no matter what corner we have to turn, no matter what rock we have to look under,\u201d Jazmine\u2019s mother, LaPorsha Washington, told a crowd of about 500 people at a rally, her voice cracking with emotion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find you, man. \u201cShe was only seven. She was only seven.\u201d Other family members expressed thanks for the outpouring of support and appealed to the suspect to turn himself in. Part memorial, part call to action, the event was held in the parking lot of a Walmart close to the scene of the shooting. Some people carried balloons, flowers or teddy bears. Amid a heavy police presence, armed activists mingled with bikers and gun-control advocates. \u201cWhen you sit in your living room and you see this stuff on TV day after day after day, you take on it like it\u2019s your own family member. And for a little child? Come on,\u201d said Alma Thompson, 67, who has five daughters and was carrying a placard that said \u201cstop the killing\u201d. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democratic congresswoman from Houston, said federal resources including the FBI were being deployed to help local law enforcement. \u201cThe heat is on and the heat is up,\u201d she said. A spokesman for the Harris county sheriff said there were no fresh updates on the case as of Saturday afternoon. Washington was driving with her four daughters to get coffee about 15 miles east of downtown Houston at roughly 6.30am last Sunday when a gunman in a pickup truck pulled up and opened fire. Washington, 30, was shot in the arm. Jazmine, who loved music and wanted to be a teacher when she grew up, was shot in the head. The family is black. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong to this man,\u201d Washington told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThis is something that I believe was a hate crime.\u201d The case has attracted national attention. The civil rights lawyer S Lee Merritt, who is representing the Barnes family, and the activist and writer Shaun King have raised a $100,000 reward for information leading to the suspect\u2019s capture. As of Saturday afternoon a GoFundMe page had raised more than $67,000 for the family. \u201cA white male who was a complete stranger to them decides to target their family,\u201d Merritt said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cWe do believe that it was racially motivated in part because our nation at this moment is a highly racially charged society. We\u2019ve seen a rise in hate crimes [according to FBI data] \u2026 this particular area of Houston is known for a racial element.\u201d Deric Muhammad, a local activist, suggested a possible link with another shooting that took place a couple of miles away in August 2017, when two black passengers were injured by a white man in a pickup truck. They survived but the attacker has not been caught. DeAndre Hopkins, of the Houston Texans NFL team, pledged his $29,000 pay cheque from a playoff game to help with funeral costs. \u201cWhen I see Jazmine Barnes\u2019 face, I see my own daughter,\u201d the wide receiver said in a tweet. \u201cOn Saturday I will be playing in your honor, Jazmine\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
