The sun gleamed from every feather of a red kite flapping lazily over the paddock as around \u00a32m-worth of thoroughbred yearlings were paraded in front of potential buyers. As Harry Herbert, the syndicate manager, conceded, it was \"a wonderful day to be an optimist\". Highclere is at the upper end of syndicate ownership, a point that is made at its annual yearling parade in some subtle, and not so subtle, ways. Prospective members park their cars in front of Highclere Castle itself, currently the architectural star of ITV's Downton Abbey, on a lawn where a Lexus is the entry-level vehicle. Next comes a coach ride through a small part of the vast acreage of Herbert's family seat. And then there are the yearlings themselves: blue-chip animals by sires including Galileo, High Chaparral and Pivotal. This is as far removed from the pub syndicate, where everyone puts in a few hundred quid, as it is possible to be. John Warren, who is also the bloodstock advisor to the Queen, travels the world looking at yearlings every autumn and then Herbert attempts to secure and market them. The cheapest shares in a Highclere Syndicate for 2011 cost \u00a36,950 plus VAT to own a twentieth of an Invincible Spirit yearling with Jeremy Noseda. After that prices for two-horse syndicates range from \u00a312,950 plus VAT (for a Motivator filly and a very attractive Manduro colt with William Haggas and Andrew Balding respectively) to \u00a336,950 for a twelfth of two colts by Montjeu and Dansili. For that kind of money people expect results and, this year in particular, Highclere has delivered. A large sign by the paddock yesterday showed the current standings in the British owners' prize money league, with Highclere fourth, behind Prince Khalid Abdullah, Godolphin and Sheikh Hamdan, son of Sheikh Mohammed. Harbinger, who won the King George at Ascot in July, contributed the lion's share of the money but Highclere also had three winners at Royal Ascot and has had 41 winners at a strike rate of 27%. It has left Herbert in a rare position for a syndicate organiser, where managing expectations is suddenly harder than shifting shares. \"Racing is a very expensive sport, you can't get away from that,\" Herbert said yesterday. \"But if we can make it more cost-effective for people, that's great. We're a hand-holding operation, if you like, to help people to get their toe into the water. \"Managing expectations is always difficult anyway but I'm an optimist and so are my team. Until proven otherwise, I think part of the enjoyment of owning racehorses is to think that your geese are swans. \"They may turn out to be geese, time will prove that in the end, but to look at horses like this, in autumn sunshine, looking as they look, bred as they're bred, and with all the effort that has gone into buying them, you have to be hopeful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
