Eventually the Tories' instinct for self-preservation kicks in, as they realise a failure to ditch IDS in 2003 will leave a new leader only 18 months to prepare for battle with Tony Blair. Expect 12 or more months of Tory bloodletting. Oh, and a happy new year. Jonathan Freedland's predictions for 2003, the Guardian A year for mutual tolerance Whether the [Iraq] conflict be short or stubborn, it will have a profound effect not only on the high politics of international relations but popular sentiment in the most lowly stations. The American and British governments should therefore expect dissent at home and abroad and accept it. At all times, there has to be an attempt to understand why some who should be natural allies of western democracies, or at least share certain common goals, feel threatened by their might, cultural as well as economic and political. Leader comment, the Times Britain, Europe and America Tony Blair's pursuit of the special relationship with America and Gordon Brown's ill-concealed doubts about joining the euro have weakened any claim we might make to be \"at the heart of Europe\". We are not and, no doubt, the judgment on the \"five economic tests\" will put us back even further. It shouldn't. As with Bush and the UN, so with Blair and Europe, it is ultimately a question of pooling sovereignty. This is the year we should start. Leader comment, the Independent Sound pound Blair's closest aides have told him he cannot win a referendum [on the euro] before the next election. That means he must wait until 2005 or 2006 before calling a poll. By that time, he'll no longer be able to use the argument that if we don't join we'll be an economic failure. Britain will have succeeded OUTSIDE the euro zone for five years in a way that will have the Germans, French and all the rest green with envy. Leader comment, the Sun Bush's plans for Iraq are immoral The US plan to strike Iraq is devoid of morality. Supposing that Iraq does possess prohibited chemical and biological weapons; does this necessitate the destruction of a whole country and forcing it into a dark tunnel of Balkanisation, Somalisation or Cyprianisation? And why do the Americans not turn towards states possessing massive arsenals of weapons of mass destruction and very close to Iraq? We think here of Israel and Turkey. The peoples of the east need no lessons in democracy from the great powers, but rather in justice and rationalism. Leader comment, Lebanese weekly Monday Morning New year's search for peace [Australians'] concern is that regardless of how the United Nations evaluates the report - due on January 27 - of its weapons inspectors, the US will make its own war against Iraq and that Australia will be dragged into it. Such a war, it is feared, would not ensure peace by dislodging Saddam and enabling his weaponry to be destroyed. Such a conflict could not be clean, contained and surgical. It would broaden and engulf the Middle East in a conflagration more terrible than ever seen before. And, far from eliminating terrorism, it would inflame it. By ordinary people peace has never been more earnestly sought. By their political leaders it has never been put more in danger. Leader comment, Sydney Morning Herald The left won't change One thing will not change. This year the international left and its American fellow travellers will continue their descent to the moral level of the philosopher Martin Heidegger, the learned imbecile who said that of course the Holocaust was bad, but so is mechanised agriculture. The left, its anti-capitalism transmogrified into anti-Americanism expressed in the argot of anti-globalisation, will repeat that of course Iraq and North Korea are dangerous, but so are McDonald's and Microsoft. Happy new year. George Will, Washington Post"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
