A survey of sex education methods, funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), has found that even the most sustained and well thought out programmes have minimal impact on the behaviour of young people - even if they do improve their knowledge and positive attitudes to sex. But Simon Forest, head of the Sex Education Forum, which advises government on policy, said that teachers in schools couldn't be expected to change the behaviour of teenagers alone. \"When you deliver a lesson in the classroom to 13-year-olds, some are pre-pubescent, some may be going out with someone, some are in the throes of puberty and some might have had sex; that's a hard group to target. We need more information in the community so that young people can select it themselves,\" said Mr Forest. Mr Forest added that there should be more information available in all aspects of young people's lives, from youth clubs to the media to support education in schools. \"School-based work is really important but parents need to be engaged as well as youth services and voluntary sector organisations. This requires coordination and commitment but it's not rocket science,\" he said. Advocating the idea of offering sexual health services in schools, Mr Forest said: \"Young people want sexual health centres open at the right times, and easily accessible - on the doorstep or in schools.\" Ofsted have also advocated the use of in-school sexual health services in some areas. An Ofsted report into the provision of sex and relationship education in schools makes the following recommendation: \"Local education and health authorities should consider how more pupils in secondary schools can have better access to individual advice from specialist professionals, including through centres on school sites\". Anne Weyman, chief executive of the FPA (formerly the Family Planning Association), said: \"This research confirms that sex and relationships education is just one important element amongst many in reducing teenage pregnancy. \"Social exclusion, poverty, low educational attainment and access to services are also key factors.\" Dr Daniel Wight, at the MRC's Social and Public Health Sciences Unit based at Glasgow University, said that the sex education model they were trialing, known as Share, was definitely an improvement on previous methods, and that they are now seeking to further improve the system. Share is a new method involving more classes, more training for teachers and more emphasis on empowerment and decision making rather than biology. However, he added: \"It also clearly shows we need to develop and assess other methods of helping young people to make responsible individual choices, if affecting behaviour, rather than just their knowledge and attitudes, remains a core objective of school-based sex education.\" The trial involved 25 secondary schools and 5,854 pupils who completed an anonymous pre-study questionnaire and follow up. The research published today was an interim study; the pupils surveyed will continue to be monitored over the coming four years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
