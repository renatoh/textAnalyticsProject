Robert Waugh, the Northumberland farmer whose pigs are thought to have been the source of the outbreak, said they had been fed on swill made from waste collected from schools in Sunderland and Gateshead. Sunderland city council confirmed that it had had a con tract with Mr Waugh's brother Ronnie to collect school waste for free, but the contract had been terminated in January when he asked for money for taking it away. Gateshead council said that it had an informal arrangement for the collection of \"plated waste\" from their schools. The Waughs also used waste from local restaurants. Robert Waugh was licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture to feed the waste to his pigs and says that it was heat-treated as required by law. Heating should inactivate foot and mouth, according to Stephen Curry, a researcher in the biophysics department at Imperial College, London. But there has been anecdotal evidence of meat products being the cause of the disease in the past. Mr Waugh's suggestion that he had not fed his pigs \"anything that hadn't already been served up on bairns' plates\" caused alarm among parents. Although humans cannot catch foot and mouth from eating meat, and the source cannot yet be confirmed, it raised the possibility that the school meals had contained infected meat. All large catering companies use burgers, sausages, mince and other cheap processed meats in their cooking, and the quality depends on the cost specified in their contracts with schools. \"There have been so many problems around meat that people do now distrust school meals,\" said Joe Harvey, direc tor of the Health Education Trust. New standards for school meals will be enforced from April. But processed meat is often made from inferior quality materials. Mechanically recovered meat (MRM), a slurry produced from pig and chicken bones, is still used. The regulations permit the use of the rectum, testicles, udders, feet and tails in MRM for cooked meat products. Because of BSE, MRM may no longer be made from the vertebral columns of ruminants in the EU, but the rules do not apply to meat products imported from outside the EU. It is an offence to import meat products from a country which has foot and mouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
