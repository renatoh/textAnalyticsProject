Britain may not have a president but when it comes to elections it flits between presidential and parliamentary impulses. In a 2015 poll by Hansard, three quarters of people could not name their local MP; party leaders are far better known, particularly now that leadership debates have become commonplace. But the degree to which people\u2019s votes are guided by party leaders can be overestimated. Manifestos matter, so do age-old affinities. Lived experience can trump it all. In 2017, canvassers in Harrow West said fly-tipping came up more often than Jeremy Corbyn. With a week to go before the election, the central issue seems to come down to trust. For the Conservatives it is about whether people trust what they say; for Labour, it is about whether voters trust that it can do what it says. The challenge for the Tories goes all the way to the top. Their leader is a liar. This is not a partisan point. It is a fact. When the issue of trust or truth comes up in televised debates, audiences laugh at Boris Johnson. With good reason. He was fired from the Times for making up quotes, and from his first post as shadow minister for lying about an affair. He lies to the public about the number of police, hospitals and nurses there will be if he wins. He lied to the Queen about proroguing parliament. Then he lied about proroguing parliament. He lies about his enemies \u2013 claiming Jeremy Corbyn wants to disband the army or ban MI5. He lies to his allies too, including the Democratic Unionist party on whom the Tories relied for a majority. Those who know him best appear to trust him least. His former employer at the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings, said Johnson \u201cwould not recognise truth, whether about his private or political life, if confronted with it in an identity parade\u201d. When he was foreign secretary, prime minister Theresa May denied him access to top secret intelligence briefings because she did not trust him. In May, he tweeted that he had just voted, even though there were no elections where he lives or in the constituency he represents. The tweet was quickly deleted. This has infected his party. Not because its leadership has never lied before but because the brazen, bare-faced, shameless lying for which Johnson is renowned has now become the norm. Changing the name of the Conservative Party press office Twitter account to \u201c@factcheckUK\u201d on debate night or Michael Gove doorstepping the leaders\u2019 climate debate with his own camera crew and then claiming that they wouldn\u2019t allow a Tory to debate, when Johnson had refused to attend, are just two examples. With Labour, the problem is less that people think Corbyn is insincere, but that when it comes to Labour\u2019s central offer \u2013 its ambitious manifesto pledges to redistribute wealth, reinvest in public services and nationalise different sectors of the economy \u2013 they fear the plans are impractical. Every day it feels like it is offering something new. In the past week it has promised free breakfasts for kids to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d schools, a reduction in train season tickets by a third, and a \u00a3100m emergency winter shelter fund for the homeless. Like the rest of the country, I think the broad thrust of these promises and policies are worthwhile. More than half of the country believes economic inequality is too great. A majority believe railway, water and energy companies should be nationalised. Half back raising taxes to support the NHS. But each time Labour offers something new I get anxious. Not because I think the country cannot afford it: it\u2019s a rich country and Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges would take our public spending to levels just above the average for developed nations and below Norway, Sweden and France. However, I don\u2019t think it has convinced enough people that we can afford it. The problem isn\u2019t that Labour hasn\u2019t addressed this \u2013 it proposes borrowing, taxing the rich and windfall taxes \u2013 but that enough people don\u2019t necessarily believe it is possible yet. A course correction of this nature requires political education. Coming out of nine years of austerity, where people have been told the country can\u2019t afford anything, many are naturally sceptical. Time and again while reporting on this election I have heard people thinking of voting Labour ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the money going to come from?\u201d This gives Labour two key challenges in the coming week. The first is not simply to emphasise Johnson\u2019s untrustworthiness but to tie it to Brexit. It\u2019s baked into people\u2019s views that he\u2019s a liar. Yet they believe he\u2019s sincere when he says he\u2019ll \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by the end of January. He isn\u2019t. He won\u2019t. He can\u2019t. Trade agreements don\u2019t work like that.They are complex and lengthy and, as we know, the timetable isn\u2019t dictated by one side. They have to nail his dissembling, conman shtick to his Brexit promise and make it clear that he\u2019s lying about that the same way he\u2019s lied about everything else and he\u2019s lying to them the same way he\u2019s lied to everyone else. Second, Labour has to stop promising new things; everyone who\u2019s been paying attention understands it is the transformative party with the big offer. Now\u2019s the time to show it can deliver that offer \u2013 to convince the electorate that Labour can be trusted with the changes that will help the country while Johnson can\u2019t even be trusted with anything, including the very policy on which his campaign hangs. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
