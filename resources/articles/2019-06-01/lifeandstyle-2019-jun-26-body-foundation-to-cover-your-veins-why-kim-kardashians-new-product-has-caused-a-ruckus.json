Why Kim Kardashian's new product has caused a ruckus", "bodyText": "As with most things Kim Kardashian does, the reality star\u2019s latest beauty product \u2013 an already sold-out Skin Perfecting Body Foundation \u2013 has sparked an online back-and-forth about whether makeup for arms, legs and other parts of the body is feminist or not. Many say body makeup is inherently anti-feminist; others argue that it is the critique of a woman\u2019s choice to wear body makeup that is anti-feminist. We live in an age where it seems that women can label anything as a feminist act. To me, however, the message the product sends is quite clear: that we would probably be more comfortable in the skin we\u2019re in if you couldn\u2019t see it has pores. As the years-old debate about whether face makeup is empowering or oppressive rages on, men for the most part continue without it. Most of us are in agreement that, however you slice it, beauty standards are rigid and beauty regimes are still driven by external pressures rather than enjoyment. There is a difference between tolerating this and seeking its active expansion and entrenchment. The existence of body makeup predates Kardashian: bronzers and highlighters have long been used to accentuate the body, as opposed to obscure it. In an Instagram post launching the product, Kardashian was candid about using it to conceal psoriasis on her legs \u2013 and many have pointed out that it is useful when they wish to cover their own skin conditions. But it would be naive to think that this isn\u2019t an attempt to usher body makeup into the everyday. Kardashian also spoke of it aiding her in tackling her decades-old secret: that she \u201chas veins\u201d, like 100% of the world\u2019s female population. A later post showed her using it on her grandmother\u2019s arms to conceal her veins, too. When Asos stopped Photoshopping its models\u2019 stretch marks, it was considered a watershed moment. An image of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s legs with the very common \u201cstrawberry skin\u201d small pock marks went viral; it was a rare glimpse of \u201cimperfection\u201d on the world\u2019s most perfect person. We are at an odd crossroads: we hail brands for showing women\u2019s bodies as they are, with stretchmarks and cellulite and rashes, but hesitate to be critical when this progress is undone by products that seek to cover them up all over again. The era of expected 24-hour perfection is well and truly upon us. It is the logical culmination of years of people such as Kardashian plugging the idea that being normal isn\u2019t normal. She did not create the system that has led us to this point, but boy, does she contribute to it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
