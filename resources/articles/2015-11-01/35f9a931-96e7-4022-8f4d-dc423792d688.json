Claudio Ranieri was delighted with the performance and the Jamie Vardy goal that broke Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s Premier League record, while Louis van Gaal was furious at the points dropped and the manner of the goal conceded. \u201cI am very happy,\u201d Ranieri, the Leicester manager, said, \u201cbecause before the match I said to my players we had two objectives today: 1) win the match and 2) try to help Vardy score and achieve the record. We take one point which is good for our table and Jamie made the record. It is fantastic for us, a very good evening.\u201d Vardy admitted getting a little carried away by the achievement. \u201cI am obviously delighted, but the main thing was the performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I think I got a bit carried away with myself [during the celebrations].\u201d Van Nistelrooy himself tweeted his congratulations. \u201cWell done vardy7! You\u2019re number one now and you deserved it.\u201d Ranieri added: \u201cI gave Jamie a signed shirt, with the date, to mark a great achievement. I signed it first, then all the players too. I thought we closed our defence very well and tried to counterattack when we could, and I was not surprised when United came with three centre\u2011backs to try and stop Jamie scoring. I have been waiting for someone to do that, and I must admit I thought about Louis when Jamie scored the opening goal. It was good for us and great for Jamie but I thought at the time that maybe Louis would be very angry.\u201d He was not wrong there. \u201cWe organised ourselves defensively to contain Vardy so we have to be disappointed at the way Leicester scored,\u201d the United manager said after witnessing what can only be described as a trademark Vardy strike. \u201cWe have seen them before, we know how they play, so we knew what would happen. It came from a corner to us, so we have to blame ourselves, we gave the goal away and that should not be possible. There were big gaps in our defence and the way we set up there should not have been. \u201cI am very disappointed with the result, because I felt we could have won this game. We could have been first in the league and we are not. If you want to be champions at the end of the season, and we all do at Manchester United, then you have to win these type of games. \u201cI think it was harder for us, after giving everything against PSV in midweek, and also because the manager decided he wanted his team to play in a different shape. We actually played a fantastic game defensively and created a couple of big chances in the second half, but still we didn\u2019t win. I cannot be happy, but at least we did better than last year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
