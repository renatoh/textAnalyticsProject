It has been a difficult week for the top flight's newcomers. Injuries and international duty meant that only four players turned up for training on Thursday. Yesterday's 3-1 win over Birmingham was discreet to say the least. The Premiership, Fulham's manager Gaute Haugenes said yesterday, \"is a different world\". More to the point, this is a different Fulham from the one that won the FA Cup in May or that beat Birmingham 7-1 in the League Cup final six months ago. Yesterday, after Stephanie Samuels had headed in from Jo Potter's free-kick to put Fulham a goal down, the player sprinted as one to the bench for water and advice. \"Come on, get to grips,\" someone shouted from the crowd, and four minutes later they did, Rachel MacArthur cutting through the middle. Kristy Moore made it 2-1 and MacArthur added a third. Not that Birmingham were disheartened. Their manager Marcus Bignot said: \"I'd have snapped your hand off at just a two-goal margin.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
