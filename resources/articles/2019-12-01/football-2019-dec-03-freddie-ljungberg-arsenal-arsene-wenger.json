Ljungberg watched Arsenal\u2019s winless run extend to eight matches with a 2-2 draw at Norwich on Sunday in his first game since taking over from Unai Emery. The Swede acknowledged that he would have preferred more time to implement tactical changes before the Brighton match, although his desire to seek out Wenger for advice appeared more urgent. \u201cI would really like to speak to him,\u201d the former midfielder said of the manager who brought him to Arsenal from the Swedish side Halmstad for \u00a33m in 1998. \u201cI\u2019m in contact with him but I haven\u2019t spoken to him because it\u2019s been a bit hectic but it\u2019s on my list to do so \u2026 He was here for 22 years as the manager, so he has a lot of experience. And he probably has some things he thinks are important that he can share with me and make me a better coach. That\u2019s what I wanted to ask.\u201d Wenger swiftly made it clear he would be happy to help Ljungberg. \u201cIf he has that need then of course I\u2019ll be available,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cMy heart is with the club and I want them to do well. Freddie is fantastically committed ... he has an opportunity. Let\u2019s get him to work with his ideas and support him.\u201d Ljungberg also intends to consult his fellow Swede Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. \u201cSven is intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to him a lot when he was the manager of England because he was watching our games. \u201cI know in the past some stories of how he treated players and how he made them feel good and things like that. I have stolen a little bit of those ideas. He\u2019s a great coach, it\u2019s been a long time and I hope I can speak to him soon.\u201d Also on Ljungberg\u2019s mind is how to dress in the dugout. He was criticised by the former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes for not wearing a suit at Norwich but joked it had been in the dry cleaners. \u201cI have seen the Premier League and seen coaches in a tracksuit, coaches with a suit, and I have seen coaches with a sweater, so I will decide on a match day what I will use,\u201d he said. Arsenal are searching for a long-term replacement for Emery but have yet to make substantial progress, with the Leicester manager, Brendan Rodgers, having apparently ruled himself out. Ljungberg admitted he was unlikely to have any input about January\u2019s transfer targets and instead has set his sights on ending a winless run that is the club\u2019s worst in the league since 1994. \u201cI\u2019m going on a match-by-match time now so there\u2019s nothing that I will get involved in,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have a very good squad but it\u2019s up to the big bosses of the club in regards to what they want to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
