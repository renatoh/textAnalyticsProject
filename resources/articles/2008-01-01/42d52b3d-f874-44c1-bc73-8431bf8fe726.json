On the eve of a parliamentary vote on the Lisbon treaty, MPs on the Labour-controlled foreign affairs select committee state that there is 'no material difference' between the two texts in critical areas. 'We conclude that there is no material difference between the provisions on foreign affairs in the constitutional treaty, which the government made subject to approval in a referendum, and those in the Lisbon treaty on which a referendum is being denied,' the MPs will say. The intervention will complicate plans by ministers to ratify the treaty in Parliament without holding a referendum. The process will begin tomorrow night when MPs hold an initial vote. This will be followed by up to two months of line-by-line scrutiny of the treaty on the floor of the Commons, where a cross-party group of Eurosceptic MPs, including most Tories, will attempt to amend the treaty bill to include a referendum. Their bid will fail because Nick Clegg has decided, in his first major decision as Liberal Democrat leader, to abstain. Brown and Clegg, who both supported Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum on the EU constitution, are rejecting calls for a fresh vote on the Lisbon treaty, on the grounds that the new measure is substantially different. Downing Street describes the Lisbon treaty as an amending measure that introduces changes to existing treaties - unlike the constitution, which would have replaced all EU treaties. Ministers are confident they will defeat the referendum calls, even when the treaty goes to the Lords, because they have embarked on a lengthy lobbying campaign to explain to MPs and peers how the measure will benefit the environment, international development and children's rights. Jim Murphy, the Europe minister, told The Observer the ratification process would highlight how the Tories are more marginalised in Europe than they were under Margaret Thatcher because no EU government or official opposition party shares their rejection of the treaty. David Cameron has suggested that as Prime Minister he would re-negotiate the treaty, a process that can only be launched with the agreement of 14 member states once it has been fully ratified. Murphy mocked the Tories by asking: 'Who opposes this treaty in Europe? The Animal party in the Netherlands, the Greek Communist party, Sinn Fein and the British Conservative party. 'Whose company would I rather have internationally? The government and opposition of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the new eastern European countries, the children's charities in Britain, the green charities, the development charities, the sports organisations, ourselves, the Liberal Democrats. I know whose side I am on and I know where the British national interest lies. It is an outward-looking Britain rather than a Britain being outside looking in.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
