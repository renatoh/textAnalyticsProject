Club medics 'popped' the joint back en route to hospital, where x-rays revealed no broken bones. \"Three or four days' rest and I should be OK,\" said Terry, who was hurt in a collision with Petr Cech. Didier Drogba had ice and a strapping applied to a knock to his knee, which Avram Grant, the manager, said did \"not look so good\" but the striker said he would be fit for Moscow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
