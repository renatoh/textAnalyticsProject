An analysis suggests that more than 70,000 people spent part of Christmas Day or Boxing Day surfing for a new employer in an attempt to beat the competition. The study, by jobsite.co.uk, found that most jobhunters were looking for vacancies in retail and customer support.

Agency Town plans tribute to Captain Mainwaring Historians want to commemorate Britain's most famous Home Guard platoon in stone. A civic society in Thetford, Norfolk, is planning to put up a statue of Captain Mainwaring - leader of the fictional Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard in the BBC comedy series Dad's Army. Dad's Army was filmed in Thetford in the 1960s and 70s and the cast stayed in local hotels. The Thetford Society thinks that a statue of the captain, played by the actor Arthur Lowe, would be a fitting way to mark the show's link with the town and commemorate the work of real Home Guard platoons during the second world war.
