They had become the first team to defeat the Ospreys here in the tournament for seven seasons, surviving two yellow cards in the second half, and they showed admirable resolve when the game seemed to be turning against them, but this was a mess of a match that showed the main issue the lawmakers have to tackle. The International Rugby Board is meeting next month to discuss the scrum which has become a shambles of crouch, touch, pause collapse. Two props were sent to the sin-bin , Paul James for collapsing and Schalk Brits for engaging early, and both left the field shaking their heads. The referee, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garces, had a night when his interpretations could charitably be described as idiosyncratic. When the Saracens flanker Kelly Brown tried to charge down Dan Biggar's kick and caught the outside-half's ankle in his follow through, he was shown a yellow card. When Moritz Botha minutes later entered a ruck from the side, the side of the Ospreys, he remained on the field. The calamitous decision-making was not confined to the officials. Ospreys had not lost at home in the tournament since Leicester won here in 2005 but they found themselves thwarted by a rush defence they were unable to master and, with their superior scrum effectively neutralised by the referee's tendency to award tit-for-tat penalties, Jacques Burger's mastery of the tackle area proved crucial. Saracens led 16-6 at half-time and their defence was resourceful enough to survive the departures of Brits and Brown. Steve Borthwick is regarded as one of the game's best lineout practitioners, but it was his tackling that stood out against Ospreys. He brought down three runners in one move alone and while the Welsh region was able to generate overlaps, it was unable to exploit them, suffocated and strangled by the speed of the defensive line. The Ospreys would have profited from scrum possession but, even though the IRB three years ago encouraged teams to attack from the set piece by making defenders stand five metres back, it has made no difference because only a small percentage of scrums yield possession and it is an issue that will vex the board next month. \"I think we would be better off not having scrums,\" said the Ospreys coach, Sean Holley. \"I do not know where we are going in that area because all a scrum has come to equal is a penalty. It is frustrating for everyone involved in the game.\" The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, emphasised the rethink needed when he remarked: \"We do not practise moves from scrums now because it is such a mess.\" The first 30 minutes marked a sequence of scrum, fight, penalty. Ospreys were exerting pressure and their experienced Wales props, Adam Jones and Paul James, appeared to have gained an advantage, but it counted for nothing because far from being a means of restarting play, the set piece became an excuse for another penalty. It is small wonder that teams are struggling to attract spectators. A scattering above 7,000 turned up for what was likely to be the pivotal match in the pool, but those who stayed away to queue in shops and bars in the build-up to Christmas had the more pleasurable experience. Two penalties from Owen Farrell and two from Dan Biggar provided the entertainment until Biggar's clearance kick was charged down by Charlie Hodgson and Ernst Joubert had enough time to let the ball bounce before picking up and scoring. It was fitting that a mistake decided the match. Ospreys hit back only when they had a man advantage, finally creating space out wide for Ian Gough to score in the corner, but Ashley Beck was twice denied and the invention of James Hook was sorely missed. Saracens have to play Biarritz at home and travel to Treviso. The only time they made an impact in the Heineken Cup was in 2008, when they defeated Ospreys on the way. \"We were determined to do better in Europe after the disappointments of last season,\" said McCall, \"and we are on track after a special win.\" Ospreys Fussell (Dirksen 57); Bowe, Bishop, Beck, Williams; Biggar (Morgan 76), Webb (Fotuali'i 54); James (D Jones 60), Hibbard, A Jones, Gough, Evans (Bearman 71), R Jones, Tipuric (capt; Stowers 76), Thomas.
