How can I get it to stretch? Katharine, Durham It sounds to me that the most likely explanation is that you\u2019re simply not giving your dough a long enough rest between mixing it and shaping it into pizzas, Katharine. Simon Bloss of Rudy\u2019s, Manchester\u2019s most popular pizza parlour and understandably always rammed, says you should leave it well alone for at least four hours, and ideally much longer, so the glutens and yeast get time to do their thing. \u201cWe leave it 24 hours before shaping,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause the glutens get tight and agitated when the dough is mixed, and you need to let them calm down a bit.\u201d If you want the soft pillow of dough that is the hallmark of a proper pizza, it\u2019s well worth the extra wait, too, because that allows fermentation to develop and the dough to rise properly. \u201cIt\u2019s only around the 24-hour mark that it really hits the sweet spot,\u201d Bloss says. This maturation is also why a good pizza will puff up the moment it goes into a very hot oven. Rudy\u2019s, which recently came 10th in a round-up of the world\u2019s top 50 pizza joints (the next highest UK entry came in at 25), mixes its dough in specialist industrial machines that are far less brutal than your typical domestic bread machine, which may also be a factor in the way Katharine\u2019s dough behaves. Giuseppe Mascoli, founder of the Franco Manca chain of pizzerias (mostly in London and the south, but with plans to branch out to Birmingham, Leeds and beyond), says that at home it\u2019s best to eschew machinery entirely and knead your dough by hand. \u201cMost domestic machines over-tighten the dough,\u201d he explains, \u201cwhich is why it springs back like that \u2013 it\u2019s just too elastic.\u201d Like Bloss, Mascoli goes for a long fermentation period after kneading \u2013 he says to aim for at least 20 hours \u2013 but he also recommends a shorter, secondary rest after the dough has been separated and shaped into individual balls, and of two hours minimum. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve just made them,\u201d Mascoli says, \u201cthe balls will be very tight, so you need to let the dough relax again. I use as little yeast as possible and the long fermentation makes up for that.\u201d That\u2019s because there are more than enough natural yeasts floating around in most environments to compensate, he adds, so long as you give them time to get to work, especially so with a traditional sourdough base, which is Franco Manca\u2019s speciality. (In an outrageously coals-to-Newcastle manoeuvre, Mascoli helped set up the chain\u2019s sole overseas branch on the Aeolian island of Salina, off Sicily, where he now lives since selling his majority stake in the business.) The temperature at which you rest your dough is also crucial: \u201cIt needs to be kept at 20-21C, ideally,\u201d Bloss says. And cover it only loosely with a clean tea towel or cloth, he adds: \u201cNever use clingfilm, because that tends to make it sweat.\u201d Mascoli also says to avoid flour that\u2019s high in protein, such as bread or buckwheat flour, because that, too, will have a detrimental impact on the dough \u2013 you\u2019re trying to make pizza here, not a loaf, after all. \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
