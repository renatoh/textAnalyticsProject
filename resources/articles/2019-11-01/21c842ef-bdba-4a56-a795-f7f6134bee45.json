At the end of the day they\u2019ve got him the sack. \u201cThe results have not been good enough. They\u2019ve not performed well enough. That\u2019s what gets you sacked as a football manager. They\u2019ve had one Champions League final and, if you look back at the run, really everything went their way a little bit. But they\u2019ve not won a trophy in five or six years with an incredible squad of players, full of internationals.\u201d Asked if he would consider returning to the club, Redknapp, out of management since being sacked by Birmingham in 2017, told talkSPORT: \u201cI\u2019d walk there tomorrow but it isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019m a realist. If he rung me and said come until the end of the season, of course I would.\u201d Broadcaster and former Spurs striker Lineker said: \u201cHe helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement \u2026 ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d Shortly after the news broke, while his party leader Jeremy Corbyn was debating with Boris Johnson live on ITV, David Lammy, Labour\u2019s MP for Tottenham, tweeted \u201cI am in shock\u201d, adding that Pochettino was \u201con the brink of something special\u201d at the club and \u201cone of the best managers in the Premier League\u201d. Dele Alli tweeted: \u201cI can\u2019t thank this man enough. He\u2019s taught me so much and I\u2019m so grateful for everything he\u2019s done for me. Good luck and hope to see you again my friend.\u201d Lammy said: \u201cThe season so far has been tough but surely not buying players in successive transfer windows has contributed. I dread going back to the yoyo of different managers.\u201d The former Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas whose time at the club ended the year before Pochettino took over, tweeted simply: \u201cShoulda backed him not sacked him! Gutted for Mauricio.\u201d Lee Dixon, who spent 14 years at north London rivals Arsenal, speculated that the move could see him join Ian Wright on the reality TV circuit: \u201cSuprise [sic] week 1 guest in the jungle? #Pochgetmeoutofhere.\u201d Chris Sutton called the Argentinian\u2019s ousting a \u201cridiculous decision\u201d. Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re shocked and saddened to hear our club has sacked Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff. We question why this decision was taken at the end, rather than the beginning, of the international break. We question whether the timing of the decision leaves the club with much choice in who takes over. \u201cTo take the decision it has, the Board must have a clear plan for what and who comes next. It needs to tell this Club\u2019s supporters what that plan is. And the Board also needs to consider its own role in this. Is the manager solely accountable?\u201d Bookmakers instantly installed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who has worked as a pundit since his removal as manager at Manchester United last December, as favourite to fill the vacancy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
