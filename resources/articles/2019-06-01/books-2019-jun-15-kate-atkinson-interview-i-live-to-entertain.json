I don\u2019t live to teach or preach or to be political\u2019", "bodyText": "After nearly 10 years, Kate Atkinson\u2019s much-loved detective Jackson Brodie returns in her 12th novel Big Sky. \u201cThe best mystery of the decade\u201d, Stephen King wrote of Case Histories, Brodie\u2019s first appearance back in 2004, but it looked as if he might have been retired for ever after his fourth outing in 2010. \u201cBrodie did have a really long holiday,\u201d the author says. During which time, Atkinson won the Costa best novel award twice, for her historical novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins, and wrote last year\u2019s Transcription. But she always intended to bring him back, or she would have killed him off, \u201cjust to put that to bed\u201d. Big Sky started as a screenplay about a female detective, and was originally written for the actor and comedian Victoria Wood, who had appeared in one of the BBC\u2019s Brodie adaptations starring Jason Isaacs. Wood did not see the manuscript before her death in 2016 so Atkinson put it aside, before eventually deciding it would work for Brodie, partly because it is set in Yorkshire, where the detective, like his creator, grew up. The idea for the story began with another Yorkshireman, Jimmy Savile, who had a home in Scarborough, with a plaque \u2013 now removed \u2013 that read \u201cSavile\u2019s View\u201d on the railings overlooking the bay. Although the DJ and TV presenter doesn\u2019t feature in Big Sky directly, he casts a shadow over a sinister web of storylines that connects child abuse rings in the 1970s and 80s to present-day sex trafficking. Atkinson began writing Big Sky the day after she finished Transcription, her second world war espionage novel. Because the idea had been lurking in her mind for so long, she says, it came really quickly, \u201cand I thought, \u2018Well I\u2019ll just keep on.\u2019\u201d But it must have been a jolt to switch from 1950s spies to contemporary sleazebags overnight. \u201cI need to change tack quite vigorously, quite often,\u201d she says. After the initial run of Brodie books, she felt she \u201cnever wanted to write another one of these again\u201d; then, following Life After Life, A God in Ruins and Transcription, she decided: \u201cI must stop writing about the war. I go on a groove for so long and then I have to change.\u201d The Brodie books always deal \u201cwith things that are happening now\u201d, she stresses. This doesn\u2019t mean writing a Brexit novel, she says, although that subject inevitably creeps in (as she points out, it even features in Transcription). For Brodie \u2013 of all Atkinson\u2019s characters \u201cthe nearest to my kneejerk reaction to things\u201d \u2013 Brexit is \u201cthe end of civilisation as we know it\u201d. As he observes, \u201cthe world had grown darker\u201d. Even by the standards of the series, Big Sky is bleak. Yet it retains the jauntiness that makes Atkinson so wickedly entertaining. \u201cI know, it\u2019s not right somehow,\u201d she says, laughing (she laughs a lot). Since Brodie\u2019s last appearance \u201cthe world is a darker place and it is an angrier place and it is a more bitter place,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what the politics has done to us \u2013 everyone is now anxious all the time, because we don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\u201d There are also echoes of the #MeToo moment as, one after another, the female characters dole out justice or revenge on a pile-up of bad men. Although she didn\u2019t intend Big Sky to be a \u201cstrong women book\u201d it inevitably became one, \u201cbecause all these middle-aged white blokes have to have their comeuppance \u2013 and who is going to give it to them?\u201d As Brodie reflects: \u201cIt was funny how so many men were defined by their downfall. Caesar, Fred Goodwin, Trotsky, Harvey Weinstein, Jimmy Savile. Women hardly ever. They didn\u2019t fall down. They stood up.\u201d She had to add names to the list as she was writing, she jokes, and if she were to write it now there would be even more to include. The honourable exception is our man Brodie, \u201cthe last good man standing\u201d, who always tries \u201cto behave like a gentleman\u201d, and although \u201cknocking on a bit now\u201d, is ready to dive into the sea or jump off a cliff to rescue someone. \u201cHe does have a sheepdog instinct,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s got to protect women and children.\u201d But he also \u201chas such a strain of darkness in him that he is always going to be responding to the outer darkness\u201d. With his tragic childhood, string of divorces and melancholic outlook, he is the archetypal hard-boiled private eye; the only trait he is missing is a weakness for the bottle. \u201cI like to take cliches and try and work with them,\u201d she says. But when she first set him to work, she was nervous because she \u201chadn\u2019t really written a male character of any substance before\u201d, and she had no intention of writing a crime novel, let alone a detective series to sit alongside Ian Rankin\u2019s Rebus or Colin Dexter\u2019s Inspector Morse books. But \u201cif you put a detective in a novel it becomes a detective novel, there\u2019s no way round it\u201d. Where traditional crime fiction is \u201cvery narrative driven, like a trail\u201d, Atkinson\u2019s genius for plotting, combined with an acute sympathy for the inner lives of her characters, has created what she likes to call \u201ca genre of Jackson Brodie\u201d (her publishers plump for \u201cliterary crime novel\u201d). Readers who would never pick up a crime novel are \u201cthe biggest Jackson Brodie fans now\u201d. Above all, the detective is a great device for bringing together multiple storylines and huge casts \u2013 Hilary Mantel once wrote that Atkinson must have \u201ca game plan more sophisticated than Dickens\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of characters,\u201d she concedes. Does her study resemble a procedural room in a TV police drama, covered with sprawling spider diagrams? \u201cIt is your working world and you know where everybody is and what everybody needs to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI can do it while I\u2019m writing it, afterwards I can\u2019t even remember anyone\u2019s name.\u201d She loves an ending (hence the seemingly endless endings of Life After Life), somehow managing to tie everything up with forensic neatness. \u201cEverybody gets their just deserts.\u201d The question of justice recurs throughout Atkinson\u2019s fiction, which always operates according to its own morality (the bodycount in a Brodie novel often rivals that of an episode of Game of Thrones). In Big Sky \u201ceveryone is breaking the law\u201d, or taking it into their own hands in one way or another. Brodie fans will welcome the reappearance of Reggie, last seen as a 16-year-old nanny in 2008\u2019s When Will There Be Good News?, now a young policewoman. \u201cWhat else would she become?\u201d Atkinson asks. \u201cNow she\u2019s never going to be allowed to be happy. Because she\u2019s always going to be seeing bad things. She will be fulfilled.\u201d Atkinson has said that \u201cyou can\u2019t write a novel about happy people having happy lives\u201d. \u201cThere is so much misery around, I never seem to get round to it.\u201d But the author herself always seems remarkably cheery, in a no-nonsense Yorkshire way. \u201cI am, on the whole,\u201d she agrees, with that laugh. \u201cIf I was really gloomy would I write different books? Maybe this is the place for it \u2013 it frees you up, because then you don\u2019t have to dwell in it.\u201d She was, however, a very fearful, anxious child, something she attributes to being \u201cillegitimate\u201d and not having a sibling (her parents were together, but her mother was unable to get divorced following a disastrous wartime marriage). \u201cThere was a lot of suppressed emotion.\u201d Born in 1951 and growing up above her parents\u2019 shop in York, she was left largely to her own devices. She also wonders if she might have been \u201ctainted\u201d by her father\u2019s own miserable childhood \u2013 one of poverty, violence and random accident \u2013 which she only discovered after his death, and which reads like the backstory of one of her characters. (His grandmother, with whom he lived until he was 10, died falling from a table trying to get a fly paper down \u2013 \u201ca wonderful little story: \u2018Imagine the fly!\u2019\u201d) Until her early 30s she never thought about becoming a writer: \u201cI was a reader, that was my part in the whole book process.\u201d But she won the Women\u2019s Own short story competition \u2013 \u201cthe best moment of my life\u201d \u2013 for \u201cthe very first thing I wrote that had nothing to do with me\u201d. This led to an apprenticeship in magazine stories: \u201cgetting everything in there in a very short space \u2026 that was how I learned to write.\u201d She published Behind the Scenes at the Museum when she was 43. \u201cEveryone said, you are quite old to have your first novel published, and I\u2019d think, \u2018Well, now I can get on with it, I\u2019ve done all the difficult things \u2026 living.\u2019\u201d She had been married twice and has two daughters and now granddaughters. Behind the Scenes won the Whitbread book of the year award in 1995, beating such big literary beasts as Salman Rushdie, which caused a bit of a brouhaha, with headlines such as \u201cUnknown chambermaid wins prize\u201d (she had once worked in a hotel). The whole experience \u201ctainted me for ever\u201d, she says now, and she has been wary of interviews ever since. \u201cI always feel as if I want to live as if I have a monastery inside me \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be giving away all the time.\u201d Although \u201cYorkshire will be written on my heart for ever\u201d, she has spent most of her writing life in Edinburgh, which \u201ccuts you off. I am beyond the wall.\u201d She doesn\u2019t enjoy parties or networking, \u201cstuff that I always presume is happening in London all the time\u201d. Although the day after we meet she is having lunch with her longtime friend Ali Smith \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s literally the only writer I know\u201d, and they never talk about writing, \u201cNever!\u201d They will be celebrating their joint No 1 positions in the hardback and paperback bestseller lists (for Transcription and for Smith\u2019s Spring ). Atkinson has never suffered from \u201cblank-page syndrome\u201d and is already at work on two novels simultaneously \u2013 \u201cIt wakes me up a bit\u201d \u2013 one of which is another Brodie. \u201cYes, he\u2019s coming back in a very funny book\u201d: an Agatha Christie homage. She\u2019s had the beginning and the title for ages \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve got titles to sell\u201d \u2013 and has already written the ending. \u201cI\u2019m in Jackson Brodie mode, so I may as well do it now as opposed to putting it on the shelf of ideas I have.\u201d Next on the shelf is her \u201cBig Book\u201d, a return to York and to the second world war, called The Line of Sight. As she has got older, she enjoys writing more. But \u201cit has really bad moments. A lot of the time it is completely tedious, but one good sentence can pay off for many, many years of tedium or hell.\u201d When the novel is completed, \u201cit\u2019s done for ever. It\u2019s in the world\u201d, and she\u2019s \u201chappy just to lie there and watch Netflix all night long, because I need to just empty all that stuff out.\u201d She has always felt \u201ca certain confidence\u201d in her writing, \u201cbut you are not allowed in this country to be confident; women aren\u2019t allowed to say \u2018I think this is really good\u2019.\u201d While readers and critics were dazzled by the formal ingenuity of Life After Life, it is its sequel, A God in Ruins, that she believes to be her best work, \u201cand will remain so\u201d, she says emphatically. \u201cThat\u2019s the book I always wanted to write. People are always telling me how they cried at the end.\u201d But she has never made the Booker shortlist (perhaps because she is perceived to be a \u201cgenre writer\u201d \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s no hope for me\u201d), and won\u2019t be on any future longlists as she has asked her publishers not to submit her work for prizes any more: \u201cAs long as I meet my own standards, that\u2019s enough.\u201d \u201cTo have moved someone to tears and to move to them to laughter is great,\u201d she says. \u201cI live to entertain, I don\u2019t live to teach or to preach or to be political. If I have a job to do it is to entertain myself first and then everyone else afterwards.\u201d \u2022 Big Sky by Kate Atkinson is published by Doubleday (\u00a320).
