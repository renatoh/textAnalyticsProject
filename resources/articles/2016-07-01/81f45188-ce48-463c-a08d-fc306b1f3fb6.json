For the holiday angler it could be quite a shock landing such an unfamiliar fish, and it will need caution. Triggerfish have small mouths but eight sharp teeth and strong jaws, useful for crushing the shells of mussels and other prey. The increase in sea temperatures of around 1C in the last 30 years, caused by climate change, has attracted this and other newcomers more familiar to fishermen in Mediterranean countries. Unlike the octopus, which still seems confined to the southern half of Britain and Ireland, the grey triggerfish is moving north quite fast. Having first been found in the south-west, it has now been recorded as far north as Tiree in the Hebrides, where the shores are washed by the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. The grey is one of around 40 varieties of triggerfish, many of them highly coloured and favourites of tropical fish tank enthusiasts. But this visitor, while less exotic, is too big for anything but a large aquarium and grows in British waters to about 60cm (2ft) in length, 2.7kg (6lbs) in weight. While there is no record yet of it breeding in the UK, and it probably returns to warmer waters in the winter, it is only a matter of time before it becomes a permanent resident. Many early reports of its presence in UK waters were dead specimens found on beaches late in the year, indicating that the triggerfish had not retreated south early enough and been killed by the cold. Already, in the south, the species is no longer a rarity to those who regularly dive on wrecks, or to sea anglers. It is found around piers, wrecks and rocky places because that is where its main food lives \u2013 various shellfish and crabs. One place it has been regularly seen and caught is Mumbles Pier near Swansea, where a large number seem to congregate each summer. When the water is clear, it is possible to see shoals swimming along looking for clusters of mussels or for food falling from above from holidaymakers. The triggerfish mainly eats shellfish, but it has a reputation for stealing the bait from fishermen, and because of its small mouth it often avoids getting caught on bigger hooks. It has tough, sandpaper-like skin and a sharp spikey dorsal. This trigger-shaped fin is what gives the species its name, because when the fin is depressed it shoots out a second fin as a form of defence. This fin is used to wedge the fish into a crevice in the rocks so predators cannot dislodge it. Despite its rather odd appearance and tough skin this variety is said to be good to eat and is a delicacy in the Mediterranean and Florida. The fact that recipes to eat them baked or fried are being swopped by anglers is not good news for the triggerfish, which, in common with many other food fish, has been over-exploited by commercial fishermen, and in some parts of its normal range is now regarded as needing protection. It is classed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d in the IUCN List of Endangered Species. However, in Britain it is still a novelty that has not yet found its way to the fishmonger\u2019s slab or on to restaurant menus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
