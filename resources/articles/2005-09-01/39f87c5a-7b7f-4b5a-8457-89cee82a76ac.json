Except without too much of the \u00e9galit\u00e9, as the government is due to announce big increases in family allowances for professional women who squeeze three or more babies out of their valuable loins. The spokesman for the National Union of Family Associations (Unaf) said that the proposals \"reflected the need to maintain a balance in society\". Which is one way of articulating an inchoate fear that has throbbed in the bourgeois bosom for generations - though it might easily be rendered: \"Jesus God, the proles are pumping out pups faster than you can say compulsory sterilisation for the unemployed - if they ever become fully conscious, we're all doomed! Doomed, I tell you!\" It goes without saying that Unaf's policies are bound to catch on here. Partly because organic rusk manufacturers and baby-yoga instructors keen to secure a 33% expansion in their market are even now joining forces to lobby for such incentives, but mainly they will be keen to import this new twist on the welfare state because most of our middle class lives in France for at least eight weeks of the year (\"We've just bought the most divine pile of bricks in Carcassonne - we're calling it Maison du Twunts, it's right next to a charcuterie where you can carve as many slices off a live, squealing pig as you want for a couple of sous!\"). There will be the problem of definition, but Millbank has already devised a questionnaire to sort the truly needful middle class from the penniless aristocrats attempting to horn in on the deal and greedy lower-class scum who aren't satisfied with the minimum wage and free DVDs almost every day in the Sun. Sample questions: Do you think the Army &amp; Navy is a) a members-only club b) a couple of career options you are considering c) a shop you pass by on your way to Matalan? Do you think the royal family are a) arrivistes b) doing a super job, all things considered c) Diana's murderers? Once we can be sure that funds are properly directed, the idea of being paid to procreate is naturally very attractive. I was always quite jealous of a friend who, in effect, used to charge her boyfriend for sex. A Topshop purchase secured him a night of straightforward missionary-positioned delights, jewellery got him some faked enthusiasm and we never asked for the story behind her Prada handbag. We only knew that it was packed with painkillers and she used to look at it with tears in her eyes that seemed to betoken something less than joy. But if we are paid to have sex for the good of society, where will it end? Soon, they'll be demanding an account at John Lewis for every sprog dropped and M&amp;S vouchers in return for voting, until the money finally runs out and some bright Subarued spark says, \"I'm sorry - in that case, I'm going to need someone to dump on a poor person's head in the street for my entertainment before I file my tax return.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
