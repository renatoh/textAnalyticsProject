The Ashes, it seems, were as compulsive viewing in Kabul as they were in the UK. There was not much chance of the side facing either England player, but the seven-match tour of this country - co-sponsored by The Observer - has provided them with the exposure to professional opposition they require if they are to progress. Playing Essex seconds may not be everyone's idea of a hard work-out, but the county side featured the promising Will Jefferson and Zimbabwe international Grant Flower. Afghanistan triumphed by one wicket, to go with victories over Glamorgan and Leicestershire reserves. Looking on was former England and Essex coach Keith Fletcher, who declared himself impressed. Fletcher probably had Mohammed Nabi and Hamid Hassan in mind. In March, in Bombay, Nabi scored 116 not out against an MCC side that included Mike Gatting, a match Afghanistan won by 171 runs. He then brought his form to England, scoring two centuries as his team won all but one of their matches. Like Nabi, Hassan will be staying on in this country for another month to receive coaching from and play for the MCC. A well-built cricketer with a handshake that could crush rocks, the 20-year-old Hassan has bowled deliveries of up to 90mph. His talent is all the more remarkable considering that he began playing the game only five years ago. Hassan is particularly excited by England's series against Pakistan next month. 'Many Afghanistanis moved to Pakistan during the war [after the Soviet invasion] and remained there until the fall of the Taliban in 2001. 'Pakistan is where we came into contact with the game and until 2003 Afghanistan played in its Grade II league,' he explains when we meet at Lord's. 'With any luck, I might be able to bowl at some of the Pakistan batsmen in the nets here before the first Test.' Unlike football, which was largely driven underground, cricket survived the rule of the Taliban, though it first had to be cleared by the Orwellian Vice and Virtue police, who suspected the game of American associations. The Afghanistan national team played its first game in 2000, with the players drawn from the 22 regional sides that comprise the national league. Hassan and Nabi will leave Lord's in August to join their team-mates in Malaysia where the side will compete against teams including Kuwait, UAE and Thailand in the Asian Cricket Council Trophy. The prize for the winners is a place in the Asia Cup one-day competition in 2008, alongside the Test nations India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 'Our game against the MCC was a turning point,' says coach Taj Malik Alam. 'We won well, got a lot of media coverage and Mohammed and Hamid were offered places here as a result. But this is now huge for us. If we qualify, then we will find it a lot easier to come by sponsors.' Alam knows this is critical. Although his players are full-time professionals, there is no spectator revenue or TV income to speak of. At the moment, the team gets by thanks to the sponsorship of Standard Chartered Bank, but facilities are basic. There are only two turf pitches, the rest consisting of carpet rolled over a cement strip. While the prospect of a Test match in Afghanistan is some years off, the example of Bangladesh provides hope. After all, who would have thought that nearly 30 years after its 1971 war of independence, it would be a Test-playing nation?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
