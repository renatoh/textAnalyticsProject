The report on the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) reform agenda by Coag Reform Council has found that while there have been some improvements across economic, health and education areas, the pace of reform has slowed since the GFC. The Lessons for Federal Reform report, released on Wednesday, scored Coag\u2019s performance against key performance measures and interviewed senior officials from all governments, political and business leaders and academics for feedback on the progress of reform. The report noted that while there was an early fast pace of reform of Commonwealth and state arrangements, this was slowed by the financial crisis due to it \u201cdiverting Coag\u2019s attention\u201d. Stakeholders agreed that the availability of funding through reward payments linked to reform in 2008-09 helped to achieve agreement and activity. But when the financial crisis hit the revenues of governments, less funding was available and stakeholders noted that \u201cthere was subsequent slowdown in reform activity\u201d. The report concludes that while Coag was successful in developing an ambitious reform agenda of federal financial relations, not enough focus was given to execution. The report crucially noted that while the 2008 Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations (IGA) was \u201cthe single most significant shift in Commonwealth-state relations for decades\u201d, the Rudd and Gillard governments had \u201cdeparted from the IGA framework in developing new reforms\". The report will provide impetus for Tony Abbott\u2019s policy to reduce crossover between federal and state bureaucracies, as it notes that the overlap of state and federal responsibilities has increasingly put \u201cpressure on intergovernmental relations and the funding that accompanies it\u201d. The report scored mixed results against educational and economic measures. While the number of students completing year 12 has increased, the engagement of young people after leaving school, in employment, education or training, has fallen. Similarly, while real incomes have risen due to strong terms of trade, multifactor productivity has declined. The report attributes this fall partly to massive capital expenditures in the mining and utility sectors. The report finds Australians are living longer, and smoking less. However, while the rate of smoking has fallen from 19.1% to 16.3%, the report suggests the Coag target of a rate of 10% by 2018 is unlikely to be met. Australia\u2019s life expectancy in the past five years rose from 81.5 years to 81.8, giving it the fourth highest life expectancy among OECD nations. The rates of death from circulatory diseases have fallen each year since 2007, from 199 deaths per 100,000 to 173.5 deaths per 100,000 in 2010. While this is good news for Australians\u2019 health, much of the nation remains stubbornly overweight. The report found there was no significant change from 2007 to 2012 in the proportion of adults or children with a healthy body weight. In 2011\u201312, the report notes, nearly two in three Australian adults (62.7%) were overweight or obese, and over a quarter of adults were obese (27.2%). This was a significant increase from 24.4% in 2007\u201308. On this measure, Australians are unfortunately punching above their weight. The OECD average in 2010 was 22.2%. The report also returned mixed results on primary care. While there was a decline in preventable hospitalisations, from 2,516 per 100,000 in 2007-08 to 2,331 per 100,000 in 2010-11, there was an increase in the number of people reported waiting what they thought was an \u201cunacceptable\u201d time for a GP appointment. The only area where the report give full marks was in water and energy efficiency. Both the amount of water and energy used per person fell during the reported time period, as did the amount of both used by industry. Against Indigenous performance measures, the report found there has been some progress in closing the gap in Indigenous health and education outcomes, but the gap has increased in employment. The participation of Indigenous persons in the labour force fell from 2006 to 2011. However, as with the overall performance of the economy, this figure was largely caused by the global financial crisis. The report recommends that Coag governance is reformed to ensure first ministers have responsibility and accountability for determining, implementing and monitoring national reform. To achieve this, the report recommends first ministers meet twice a year to report against reform targets. It also recommends a long-term strategy for improving performance reporting be developed and that governments shift back towards more outcomes-based reporting rather than focussing on inputs. The date for the first Coag meeting under the Abbott government has yet to be announced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
