To go on a late-night drinking session a few days before a crucial England match, particularly after what happened to Frank Lampard, is potty. I'm not opposed to players enjoying themselves but it's got to be in the right place at the right time. Gerrard may have saved his bacon by apologising but if Sven-Goran Eriksson leaves him out of tomorrow's game against Greece I don't think he could complain. The England coach fired a warning across the bows of his squad by dropping Lampard after the Chelsea midfielder was involved in a drinking binge with three team-mates and Frank Sinclair. There's no suggestion Gerrard behaved as badly, but I'm shocked he was so stupid. Those two incidents show that some players still do not understand their responsibilities. Footballers have always lived in the spotlight but the high-profile ones are even bigger than pop and television stars in terms of public adulation these days. That means their behaviour's going to be monitored. I'm particularly surprised by Gerrard. From what I've been led to believe, he saw the light a while back in terms of looking after himself, knowing he'd had injuries and that maybe excesses off the field were hampering him. His French osteopath has stressed the importance of diet. Players now are fully aware of the need to eat, drink and live sensibly. Plenty have alcohol, and sometimes it helps them unwind, but there's a difference between unwinding and going over the top in staying out until 2am in the week of a World Cup match. I did not allow my players to visit licensed premises without permission after Wednesday night, even before a run-of-the-mill Saturday game. If they were taking the wife for a meal they had to ask if they could have a bottle of wine. I'd look at who it was and decide. It's no secret that at Manchester United I had players who liked a drink but I can't think of an instance when I had to pull up people like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside or Kevin Moran. They would stop others in the team who were out of order because they were strong-minded and knew what was wrong and right. Occasionally I had to punish players. On a pre-season trip to Amsterdam with United, six lads didn't show for dinner. After a couple of hours we got worried and thought they'd gone on a river boat which had tipped up. It turned out they had got lost in the city, where they'd been drinking. I had their training kits dispatched to their rooms at 7.30 the next morning and sent them to run around the park opposite the hotel for two hours before seeing me. I was never averse to players having a sensible Saturday night out after a game, as long as there wasn't a match a couple of days later, and I occasionally used alcohol to relax a squad, as Brian Clough did. The night before a cup final Cloughie once got his players out of bed at midnight, took them into a room, gave them a drink for an hour or so and then sent them back to bed. We did something similar at Sheffield Wednesday two nights before the League Cup final against Manchester United. I took the boys and their wives out to a swish restaurant in London; they were wined and dined, and after training hard the next day they slept as well as could be. That was what we'd aimed for and we won 1-0. Because few of that team had played a match of that size, I didn't want them fretting and sleeping badly. It was right for those circumstances, but with a more experienced team you might do things differently. If someone said, \"Gaffer, it would help me sleep if I had a beer,\" I'd say fine, have a bottle, but have it in front of us. I didn't want anyone ducking round a corner and drinking. The drink issue has been addressed in this country but you have to remember it's a big cultural, social thing. It was different when I went to Atletico Madrid. The players didn't drink, except wine with their meals. On the continent clubs do not tend to have players' bars, and one player at Atletico had virtually the whole city pointing a finger at him after he went out drinking one night. There had been no bad behaviour but he was disciplined. Gerrard may know that the great Liverpool sides of the 70s and 80s felt they could beat anybody not only at football but also at golf and drinking competitions. But they were probably the best club side ever. And it was right place, right time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
