Rose, along with Ruthie Rogers, became one of the most important figures on the UK food scene, and her influence was felt far and wide, both for her celebration of simple Italian cooking, and in nurturing some of the country's best chefs. We have published an obituary here, you can read more about her here, and about the River Caf\u00e9 restaurant. Matthew Fort and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have written at length about their memories of Rose. If you're looking for inspiration to cook a meal in her memory, we have today published this River Caf\u00e9 video recipe for zuppa alle vongole (clam soup) with Ruth, and tomorrow, we'll be publishing another one on making a classic gnocchi. There's also a video for fried courgette flowers, a recipe for cherry focaccia, an asparagus and herb risotto and some antipasti recipes here, and a collection from River Cafe Easy including puntarelle alla Romana; beef carpaccio, pappardelle with pancetta and tomato; slow-cooked pork shoulder; a variety of crab recipes, poached turbot and a coffee, walnut and hazelnut cake. I'll hand over to Rose and Ruth's former chefs and colleagues to start the tributes flowing on Word of Mouth. Do please add your own thoughts below. Jamie Oliver \"I'm so saddened by the death of Rose. She really was one of life's very very special, natural, genius chefs; a true pioneer of delicious simple cooking. It was my honour to have worked with her - a really great boss, a wonderful person who gave me some of my fondest cooking memories and great funny times. The quality of food and chefs that have left the River Caf\u00e9 over the last 20 years speaks for itself and is all credit to the partnership, love and values of Rose Gray and Ruthie Rogers. Without question the world has lost one of the most important chefs of our times, she will be sorely missed.\" Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall \"When it came to encouraging and teaching her cooks, Rose always called it how she saw it (or tasted it), but she was also unfailingly generous with her time and her praise. She wanted us to enjoy our cooking as much as our River Caf\u00e9 guests, and once she felt we'd broken the back of the shift she'd open a bottle of Prosecco and pour everyone a glass. She will be remembered by everyone who ever ate the wonderful Italian food cooked by her and Ruthie, and appreciated for years to come by all who have wowed their friends with recipes from the five amazing River Caf\u00e9 cookbooks.\" \u2022 Read Hugh's full tribute Theo Randall \"I went there when I was 21, and I always remember when I went there to be interviewed for the job, Rose said, 'So you think you're a good cook, do you?' I was terrified at the time, but she was the most brilliant person to work for, very disciplined but also very entertaining. She had a profound knowledge of Italian food, and she was utterly passionate about it. She was a very determined woman, and she absolutely refused to compromise on quality. If she thought something wasn't good enough, she sent it straight back. She was such an inspirational person - both her and Ruthie - and working with her was a great honour and a pleasure. I worked at the River Cafe for 15 years and I just loved it, which is why I was there so long. There was such an energy and determination to make things great. \"We had these inspirational River Cafe trips to Italy to meet suppliers - olive oil producers and so on - Rose would find ingredients in markets, bring them back and come up with some new ideas in the restaurant to use them. It was magical in a way and I think about how lucky I and others were to work with someone like that ... everyone would do anything to work with her. Ruth and her were perfect for each other - they were a perfect combination and that was the key to it. \"She wasn't a trained chef, I remember these artistic hands, she would create things - you'd be racking your mind and she'd just get a knife and do it and lo and behold, something would be created. She also used to get the waiters involved, they'd stand in a line and she'd chat to them - everyone was mesmerised, she instilled a fondness for food in everyone - they'd all go home and cook.\" Sam and Sam Clark \"Rose always encouraged a dialogue about food. Coming from a culture where young chefs were seen and not heard and where one was grateful to be sworn at, this immediately set her apart from the rest, away with the macho bullshit and bullying. Here was a clever, articulate and passionate chef who instilled confidence and understanding in a family-like environment. At the tail end of nouvelle cuisine Rose would deliberately mess up plates, she banned 'garnish' and sneered at 'jus'. She was always the rebel. \"The River Cafe was Rose's life and it is a masterpiece. No one in the industry has produced disciples of such a high quality and at the same time been loved to such a degree. Rose inspired us both as a cook and a friend from the first moment we met her and will continue to so for the rest of our days.\" Allegra McEvedy \"Out of all the great men and women I've been lucky enough to work with, Rose will always be the most important to me. Her uncompromising attitude to ingredients was truly revelatory - back in the early 90s provenance just wasn't the hot issue it is now. Watching her cook was a perfect balance of skill, feel and taste, but like all the chefs who've been lucky enough to work with her, it was her attitude, language and confidence that put her in a class above. \"Inevitably two feisty women like us had our altercations and after a life-changing year working at the River Cafe, it all came down to a sunny monday morning in June. I knew she and I were going to have words as we'd had a run-in before the weekend, so I came in early, and, chatting very calmly while Rose prepped some bass we agreed that I should leave. Right then, at 8am. To this day, the whole thing was so civilised and mutually respectful, I'm not sure if I got fired or left, but certainly there was nothing but warmth after that whenever we ran into each other over the years. \"Rose was a great teacher - I liked her, totally admired her, at times was a bit scared of her but ultimately she shaped the cook I am more than any other person I've ever worked with, and for that I feel very grateful and very, very lucky.\" Matthew Fort \"Through a combination of style, passion, rigour and charm, Rose and the River Caf\u00e9 have had a profound influence on other chefs, on cooks and writers, and on the way we experience and appreciate Italian food. Rose has left a legacy that few cooks achieve.\" \u2022 Read Matthew's full tribute"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
