Number of deaths; number of attacks; number of gunshots heard overnight; number of wounded at the hospital; number of villages that have been destroyed; number of armoured trucks heading off into battle. We aid workers providing assistance in conflict situations are interested in numbers too, and some of those in eastern Chad worry me this morning. Number of internally displaced Chadians who've fled their homes over the past few months after militias attacked their villages: 120,000. Number of Sudanese refugees who've fled to Chad to escape the conflict in Darfur over the last three years: 230,000. Number of people who have built makeshift shelters in Gourounkoun, the area where I will be working today: 15,000. Number of latrines in Gourounkoun: 0. Number of water sources: 0. Number of degrees when I step outside of my door at 8am: 40. Number of security meetings I've already had this morning to discuss numbers: 1. My Oxfam colleagues and I are working on changing some of those numbers. Humphrey, our geophysicist, has been carrying out surveys on water sources at Gourounkoun for two weeks, and has found at least five potential sites where he suspects there is water. Thomas, the leader of our drilling team, proved him right on Friday when he hit water for the first time, at a depth of 40 metres. If all goes well, the displaced people living here will have their first water source by the end of this week. Around the same time, latrines will start going up, now that three Oxfam cargo planes full of latrine slabs and plastic sheeting have arrived in eastern Chad. Unfortunately, there are some numbers we can't do much about. We can't tell people how many more days they will have to live in their temporary straw shelters. We can't know when they will finally feel safe again. And as a humanitarian agency, there's little we can do to stop the attacks on villages and civilians that have displaced them. As the conflict spreads in the increasing lawless border areas between Chad and Sudan's Darfur region, traditional rivalries between different tribes or clans are spiralling into major conflict as the groups are becoming more organised, more numerous, and much better armed. And while people are grateful to the aid agencies for fiddling with these numbers, they keep telling us that they still don't feel safe. They have different sets of numbers. \"When the militia attacked Modoyna, they took dozens of my family's cattle, goats, everything. The men tried to protest and get our belongings back, so the militia started killing them, \" Achta, a 60-year-old grandmother tells us when we stop by her hut. \"Four of my sons were killed, and 11 others of my family.\" She gestures at a young woman next to her, who is breastfeeding a newborn baby. \"This is my oldest now. I had another daughter, her older sister, but she was killed too.\" This week, the UN security council will debate whether or not to deploy an international force to stop attacks against civilians in Chad. They too will talk about numbers: how many troops they could send, how many dollars they could afford, how many months it would take before they get there. I wonder how important Achta's numbers will be to the UN security council as it ponders how to resolve the crisis in eastern Chad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
