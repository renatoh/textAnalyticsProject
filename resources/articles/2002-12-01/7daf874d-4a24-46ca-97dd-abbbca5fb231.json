Only \"about 15 to 20 percent of the population\" get high volumes of email. Maurene Grey of Gartner Research was not impressed by the survey. Doubtless between frantically stabbing at the delete key, she said: \"We've found workers are extremely overloaded. My gut reaction was who in the world were they interviewing?
