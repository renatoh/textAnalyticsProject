The Corbett family, who hold around 5% of the club's shares, has called for change at the top of the club and delegated Michael Wilde, the largest individual shareholder, to act as their proxy. Lowe's probable opponents are estimated to control nearly 40% of shares in the club's parent company, Southampton Leisure Holdings. Lowe has a personal stake of 6.69% and could expect the support of other board members and shareholders with an estimated 20%. The intentions of other shareholders are not known. Wilde, whose individual stake stands at 18.29%, is thought to be prepared to call an extraordinary general meeting at the end of the season at which he could table a motion to have the chairman removed from his post. If that happens, Wilde is likely to be supported by the second largest shareholder, Leon Crouch, who has openly called for the removal of Lowe and the director of football Sir Clive Woodward. Lowe has said that he has no intention of resigning. Wilde has not spoken in detail of his plans, although he has said that he supports Woodward and the head coach George Burley. He has also recently won the public backing of the former manager Lawrie McMenemy, who remains an influential figure in Southampton. Four board members appear to have turned on Lowe in recent weeks by selling their shares to Wilde. Woodward, who remains supportive of Lowe, called the sale by Paul Thompson, Keith Wiseman, Ian Gordon and Brian Hunt \"disgraceful\". Mary Corbett - who is the daughter of John Corbett, the club's former president - yesterday issued a statement explaining her family's decision to support Wilde. It said: \"It is alarming four loyal directors felt obliged to sell their shares in order to get the message across that they are not in agreement with Rupert Lowe's decision-making style.Myself and my family are saddened at this sorry state of affairs and we believe the fans deserve better, for they are the life and soul of the club. Southampton should be a Premier League club, not languishing near the bottom of the Championship.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
