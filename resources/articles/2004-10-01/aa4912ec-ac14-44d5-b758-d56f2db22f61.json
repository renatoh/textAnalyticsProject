Pryce suffered the injury late in the Bulls' play-off victory over Leeds two weeks ago. The news is a double blow for Brian Noble, who coaches both Britain and the Bulls. Not only did Pryce play a key role in Bradford's 26-12 win at Headingley by bottling up Keith Senior, one of Leeds' main attacking weapons, but he was also in line to fill one of the wing positions in the Tri-Nations. With the squad's sole Irishman, Wigan's Brian Carney, struggling with a hamstring problem, Noble may have to find two new wings for the match at the City of Manchester Stadium on October 30. Paul Johnson, who played for Wigan against Bradford in last year's grand final, is likely to replace Pryce at Old Trafford. Noble has named a 19-man squad for the match, including both Pryce and Paul Anderson, but the big prop, who announced his Test retirement yesterday, seems certain to have played his last match for the Bulls, as he will join St Helens next season. Andrew Dunemann is in contention for Leeds after missing last Friday's win against Wigan with a knee injury, but his fellow Australian Matt Adamson is expected to miss out. The former Leeds centre Tonie Carroll will become the first man to play for Australia and New Zealand for 90 years in the Tri-Nations opener in Auckland on Saturday. Carroll, who was born in Christchurch but moved to Australia when he was five, played for the Kiwis against Australia in the 2000 World Cup final at Old Trafford but has now been named at loose forward for the Kangaroos. Britain's Russell Smith has been appointed to referee the match, leaving Steve Ganson to take charge of his first grand final. Hull Kingston Rovers have appointed the former Great Britain prop forward Harvey Howard as their new head coach. The 36-year-old, who has agreed a two-year deal, will take over from Martin Hall following the latter's decision to leave the National League One club last week. Howard retired from playing earlier this year after injuring his neck in a car accident. He joined the Robins two years ago and worked as assistant coach under Steve Linnane in 2003. As well as coaching the first team, Howard will also oversee the club's youth development and their links with the amateur game. Widnes have signed the 20-year-old wing or full-back Paul Ballard from Wigan on a one-year deal. Ballard was top try-scorer in the Warriors' senior academy side last season.
