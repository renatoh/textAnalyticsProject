So very painful,\u201d the 61-year-old carpenter sobbed. \u201cJust look at what they have done to my boy.\u201d Before him, on a church\u2019s wooden pew, lay the body of Pedro Quisbert Mamani, 37, a factory worker and father of two \u2013 and one of at least eight young Bolivians killed on Tuesday when the country\u2019s political crisis exploded into deadly violence in the city of El Alto. Nearby lay another five bodies, their feet poking from blankets or flags, their names and ages printed on A4 sheets placed on top of the corpses. \u201cJoel Colque Patty, 22\u201d; \u201cDevi Posto Cusi, 34\u201d; \u201cAntonio Ronald Quispe Ticona, 23\u201d; \u201cClemente Eloy Mamani Santander, 23\u201d; \u201cJuan Jose Tenorio Mamani, 23\u201d. Three disposable cups had been placed on the tiled floor beneath Mamani\u2019s cadaver to catch the constant drips of blood coming from a gaping bullet wound to the back of his head. \u201cIt was one shot in the nape \u2013 just look at how he is bleeding,\u201d his father said as forensic pathologists donned white suits and face masks and prepared to perform autopsies on the bodies, right there in front of the altar. \u201cI raised my son with so much love \u2013 and now I must bury him. Do you know what that is like for me?\u201d Quisbert asked. \u201cTo raise, to educate - and then to bury?\u201d Evo Morales \u2013 the country\u2019s exiled former president \u2013 described the events in El Alto as a \u201cmassacre\u201d. \u201cIn Bolivia, they are killing my brothers and my sisters,\u201d he told reporters in Mexico City on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the kind of thing the old military dictatorships used to do.\u201d The rightwing interim government that took power after Morales\u2019 toppling on 10 November has rejected claims the army was behind Tuesday\u2019s killings, which came during confrontations between troops and Morales loyalists outside a fuel storage depot the latter had been blockading. Bolivia\u2019s defense minister, Fernando L\u00f3pez, told reporters \u201cnot a single bullet\u201d had been fired by his forces, and branded demonstrators \u201cterrorists\u201d acting on the orders of Morales. But in El Alto \u2013 a teeming high-altitude city near La Paz long considered a Morales stronghold \u2013 locals are adamant the government is to blame for what they call a massacre of innocent workers. \u201cWe cannot allow them to slaughter us like this,\u201d shouted Joana Quispe, 40, one of thousands of mostly indigenous demonstrators who had packed the streets around the city\u2019s Saint Francis of Assisi church on Wednesday to denounce the killings. Outside the simple redbrick church, the mood was one of fury and defiance as locals attacked Bolivia\u2019s interim president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, and her rightwing coalition. \u201cOur government is racist,\u201d fumed Ricardo Benito Mamani, 56. \u201cThey are trampling on our democracy. This lady president has to go.\u201d Roadblocks cobbled together from concrete slabs, sign posts, burning tires and car parts \u2013 and the presence of heavily armed Bolivian security forces \u2013 gave the stunning, mountain-ringed community the air of a war zone. Inside the church, there was rage too. \u201cThe world must know the truth,\u201d insisted Aurelio Miranda, 54. \u201cWhat happened was a massacre \u2026 They used weapons like you use in a war. They didn\u2019t think about the consequences. That\u2019s why so many are dead.\u201d \u201cI feel so much pain as a Bolivian, that Bolivians are slaughtering their own brothers,\u201d Miranda added. Primitivo Quisbert still seemed too dazed by his loss to point fingers. As cries of \u201cJustice! Justice! Justice!\u201d filled the church, he told of how his family had been preparing for a new arrival, not a funeral. His dead son\u2019s wife was eight months pregnant with a child who will now never meet its father. \u201cWe\u2019re not members of any party. We\u2019re not interested in any of this. We are humble people who know how to work,\u201d Quisbert said. \u201cHow can they just kill you as though you were a dog?\u201d On the wall above the grieving father, and the improvised altar-side morgue, elegant metal letters spelled out the Prayer of Saint Francis. \u201cLord, make me an instrument of your peace Where there is hatred, let me sow love Where there is injury, pardon Where there is doubt, faith Where there is despair, hope Where there is darkness, light And where there is sadness, joy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole night \u2013 here with my son,\u201d Quisbert said. \u201cI cannot let him go.\u201d Additional reporting Cindy Jimenez Becerra in El Alto and Jo Tuckman in Mexico City"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
