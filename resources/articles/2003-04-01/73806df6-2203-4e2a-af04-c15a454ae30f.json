In reality, I'm lying, naked, on an ancient, wooden massage bench, in a room lit by a couple of candles and smelling of incense sticks. The room is in Kovalam, in the southern state of Kerala, in India. And I'm in the middle of a week's panchakarma detox treatment. Panchakarma is the king of Ayurvedic treatments and Kovalam, a small, laid-back seaside resort, is the world centre of Ayurvedic medicine. Although Ayurvedic treatments date back to 4500BC, they have only caught on in the West in the past decade and become popular with the likes of Madonna, Jade Jagger and Prince Andrew. Panchakarma translates as 'five actions' in Sanskrit and is a culmination of various Ayurvedic treatments, from massage to nasal drops, over a minimum of seven days. The idea is that the mind and body are cleansed of toxins - it's like giving your Nissan Micra a deluxe car wash. It can only be a matter of time before we discover that a certain Prime Minister's wife has panchakarma every morning, in-between spreading organic honey on her husband's toast and preparing to defend some landmark human rights case. The problem is that in Britain treatment by a properly trained panchakarma practitioner is hard to find and very expensive. At the Hale Clinic in London, one session lasting an hour and 45 minutes costs \u00a3110 (an average course is seven sessions or \u00a3770). It cost me about the same amount to fly to India, stay in a package hotel and sign up for a week's treatment with the kind of doctors who have been brought up immersed in the Ayurvedic way of life. I pitch up in India feeling like a walking wheelie bin. There's a lot to detox: smoking, alcohol, coffee, crisps, chocolate, chips, cakes. Home stress, work stress and getting-to-work stress. And all the stored up irritants of twenty-first-century life - plumbers who don't turn up, cashcards that don't work, jet lag after a delayed flight. Not to mention the log jam of emotional Ally McBeal stuff that I seem to have acquired over 35 years. My doctor, Dr Sambhu - or Sambhu as most people call him - is small and smiley and charismatic. He's based in a small surgery at the top of the short, steep hill leading to the beach in Kovalam - nicknamed Cardiac Hill because two people died walking up it. The rooms are soothing and cool; they seem miles away from the bustling beach where you can be stopped every few yards by people trying to sell you sunglasses or sarongs or packs of Marlboro Light. Sambhu comes from a family of Ayurvedic doctors and used to practise from a local hotel until he tired of the water always packing up and, 12 years ago, built his surgery on a vacant plot of land. Now he travels from the US to Germany and back to India again doing his panchakarma treatment. He's treated people going through chemotherapy and depression, arthritis and immune system disorders. I'm suffering from modern-day angst, which is pretty low down on the scale of things. He's nothing if not direct. 'You've put on weight,' he says. (I first visited him two years ago. I was thinner then.) 'So, tell me, what are you eating?' He asks me questions about my diet, my lifestyle, what's happening at home. More questions than my GP has ever cared to ask. 'Last time you came you were a little depressed, I think. How are you now?' What he's doing is deciding what type I am - Ayurvedic medicine recognises three energy elements: air (vata), fire (pitta) and water (kapha). According to Ayurvedic medicine, these three doshas form the basis of our physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. When these elements are balanced, we are healthy in mind and body. Illness is caused by an imbalance. He decides I have got a fire/water imbalance, which means, briefly, that I'm prone to getting fat and cross. The treatment consists of daily massages with warm oils specially mixed for each patient. The massages work along your lymphatic system, hoovering away toxins as they go. It's not so much a hard, Swedish, muscular rubdown, as a mellifluous, tender stroke. This is followed by a stream of warm oil which is dripped on to your 'third eye' in the middle of your forehead. You are left feeling energised but also soothed. Finally, you scrub yourself down with an exfoliating and invigorating sludgy mixture of herbs, and then take a shower. Do not even think about doing panchakarma if you tend to avoid communal changing rooms. You must leave your inhibitions behind. India is not big on paper knickers - and you're going to be swilling around, covered in oil in the altogether. There's really no point worrying if your bum looks big. Talking of which, one part of the treatment is an enema to clear out the colon. Each day brings its own routine. Kerala is much more laid-back than other parts of the country - India-lite, if you like. I wake up, go for a swim, and choose between a few hours beside the pool at Kovalam's Sea Face Hotel, where you can have fresh lime sodas brought to you, or the lido on the quiet Samudra beach, 20 minutes north of the main drag where you can sit inches away from crashing waves and a cow tethered on the bank. Lunch is at the Lonely Planet Caf\u00e9, a shady, utilitarian sort of place overlooking a pond which serves the best vegetarian food you'll eat anywhere. Masala dosa followed by cardamon tea will set you back precisely one pound. Every day at 3pm I huff and puff up the hill to Sambhu's for my daily rubdown. Afterwards I float back down the hill feeling, well, mildly stoned without the paranoia or the munchies, in time for the sunset and some supper at one of the restaurants selling fresh fish on the seafront. This is the first time I've gone on holiday on my own - and it's surprisingly easy. I please myself: read, listen to music and take delight in spying on moody couples who are either not speaking or arguing. No one gives me a second glance. Kovalam encourages a mixed bunch of tourists, from adventurous young couples with a baby in tow to thirtysomething women suffering from mild urban meltdown. By the end of the week I'm eating healthily, exercising daily, sleeping well, smiling benignly at strangers. I've also not had any alcohol for a week, which is, frankly, unheard of. I can't claim any great revelations. But I do know there's no better pick-me-up than a week's worth of panchakarma on the coast of Kerala. Apart from two weeks' worth... Factfile Trailfinders (020 7938 3939) has flights with Sri Lankan Airlines to Trivandrum in Kerala via Colombo for \u00a3480 including taxes. Rooms booked through Trailfinders cost from \u00a340 at the Hotel Samudra, which has an ayurvedic treatment area. Seven days of panchakarma treatment with Dr Sambhu costs $200.
