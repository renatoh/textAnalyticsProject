The country to which this description now applies is not Iraq but Syria - or, rather, the description always applied to both of the states where the Ba'ath party's assumption of power turned out in practice to mean government by sect, clan, family, and a president for life. True, the Syrian regime was less gratuitously violent, more rational, and more cautious internationally than the one in Baghdad. There were already encouraging economic changes and some relaxation of political controls under the late Hafez Assad. The difference between Iraq and Syria is illustrated by the fact that when Bashar Assad succeeded his father, there were hopes of a \"democratic opening\". But there has been no such opening, and Bashar, those who advise him, and those who serve the regime have lurched from misjudgment to misjudgment in international affairs. The worst of those errors, the United Nations investigation into the death of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri seems to suggest, may have been by those who either ordered the murder of this popular, if flawed, politician because he was seen as obstructing continued Syrian control of Lebanon, or permitted others to kill him. The UN investigation has not established exactly where responsibility may lie, but it has concluded that it is difficult to see how an assassination plot could have been carried out without the \"approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials\". The German judge heading the inquiry has asked for more time and the UN secretary general has extended his mandate for a further seven weeks. The US secretary of state and the British foreign secretary have asked for a meeting this week of the foreign ministers of countries serving on the security council, presumably to bring pressure to bear on Syria to allow face-to-face interviews of some of those senior officials, who include President Assad's brother-in-law, the head of Syrian military intelligence, by the United Nations team. Everybody knows that this investigation, and the inquiries by the Lebanese authorities it is designed to assist, is not only about bringing to justice, if possible, those who organised the murder of Mr Hariri and of 22 other people with him, and who then capped that atrocity, almost certainly, by killing the young man they had set up to take the blame for the crime. It is also unavoidably about the future of the Syrian regime. That, in turn, bears heavily on the future of Lebanon and must have an impact on the region as a whole. The regime in Damascus may already have been in a weakened state before Mr Hariri's death, since the young president, possessing neither his father's authority nor his astuteness, was already finding it hard to control the factions within the elite. Continued investigations, depending on how high they go, could weaken it further. The Americans and the Israelis, contrary to some impressions, may not want regime change, preferring a vulnerable Assad who can be persuaded to do what they want on Iraq and Palestine. Yet they could trigger it nevertheless, and the last thing the Middle East needs is another government toppled from the outside. If the Syrian regime is to change it is Syrians who should change it. The pursuit of those responsible for the killing of Mr Hariri cannot be be allowed to falter, but regime change should not ride on the back of judicial process. The French are already insisting on this, and the Americans and the British, the other two nations who have taken the lead over Syria, would be wise to follow suit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
