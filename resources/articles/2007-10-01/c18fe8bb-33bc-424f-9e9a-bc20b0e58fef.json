Cars sprouted flags and some carried signs reading 'Habana for President' for Bryan Habana, the winger who looks set to be crowned World Player of the Year today. Before setting off to Paris, President Thabo Mbeki appeared in a Springbok jersey and insisted the team would 'bring the Webb Ellis Cup back to the south, away from its temporary sojourn in the north.' Nelson Mandela sent a video message to the players in which he raised a fist and ordered, 'Go, Springboks, go.' Dissent over the predominantly white nature of the team dissipated in the hours leading up to the game, but race still managed to dominate in odd ways. The South African Rugby Union has been told off for airing an advert in which a ball is dropped from a plane and picked up by a San bushman: the San hunter discards the ostrich egg he is carrying and returns to his village to teach his neighbours rugby. Some thought it insensitive. Meanwhile, the Star newspaper felt it necessary to run a story under the headline 'Jew or no Jew, the Boks will still triumph', if only to remind readers of the part Jewish players have taken in the past. In 1995, Joel Stransky kicked the winning drop goal. Such are the vagaries of the South African media. Every bar contained a solicitous waiter promising buy-one-get-one-free drinks and bumper-sized televisions. It's been a good week for companies that rent out big screen TVs in South Africa. Even the best restaurants had waiters wearing Springbok jerseys, who looked askance at anyone looking at them askance. Outside Scusi in the suburb of Parkview, the Durrs and the Smiths were preparing for the game with a large lunch. The men were in rugby shirts, the women had flags as shawls. 'Bokke Bokke,' the occupants of passing cars shouted in Afrikaans. 'Bokke, Bokke,' the Durrs and the Smiths shouted back. The spirit of one of their ancestors was with them, they said: apparently Jonathan Durr captained the Barbarians in the early 20th century. His spirit is still alive now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
