It is believed a sale is being forced on the Saints for financial reasons. The Saints coach Ian Millward has told the club he does not want to sell Gleeson, suspended by a Rugby Football League inquiry after winning \u00a3909 by betting on Saints to lose at Bradford on Easter Monday. But Warrington, boosted by cash injections from a builder and the concert promoter Simon Moran, have made a substantial offer. Gleeson may not be the only enforced departure. Sean Long, banned for three months for likewise betting against his own side, may also be leaving. Millward said he had heard rumours but denied that Gleeson was about to join his younger brother Mark at Warrington. The Wolves refused to comment. An RFL inquiry into a stormy National One match between Hull KR and Doncaster on July 11 will hear allegations that Doncaster's coach St John Ellis was involved in post-match confrontations in the tunnel and the bar, as well as a claim from Doncaster that Rovers fans pelted the visiting players with missiles. Hull KR insist the latter suggestion is a Doncaster \"smokescreen\". Their chairman Neil Hudgell said legal action against Doncaster was a \"great possibility\" after evidence was gathered from fans and stewards and a dossier was submitted to the league. He said: \"I will do everything I can to resist sensationalised and trumped-up allegations which divert attention from where it needs to be.\" Several sources confirmed Ellis will be asked by the RFL about claims he was involved in two confrontations and it is understood he will also face questioning over incidents at two other Doncaster away games this season. Doncaster's chairman John Wright said missiles were thrown at his team. \"All their supporters were running down to shout abuse at our team and, to be fair, on the video our team do not appear to be responding much,\" he said. The investigation may take weeks but the league is anxious to conclude it before the play-offs, when the teams are likely to meet again and Wright will demand extra stewards. Wigan's long-time target Mark Gasnier will stay with St George Illawarra after failing to negotiate a contract release. Wigan's chairman Maurice Lindsay said he was \"staggered\" as the centre's agents had assured him he would sign. Lindsay has recalled Luke Robinson from loan at Castleford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
