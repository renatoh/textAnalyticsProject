Dimbleby said he was so determined to have an impact he was setting aside four days of his working week without pay for one year to work on the study. The review will be the first significant assessment of the British food system in 75 years and could be one of the final actions by Michael Gove as environment secretary. Gove is likely to leave the post when a new prime minister is appointed. The \u201cfarm to fork\u201d study has been in the pipeline for two or three years and will start taking evidence in the coming weeks. A full report is due in 2020. The review will examine the interlocking issues of environment, agriculture, health and big business, including the responsibilities of supermarkets and the restaurant trade. Gove described the review as a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity to cultivate a stronger food system. \u201cLeaving the EU is a great opportunity for British farmers and food producers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with an expanding population the urgent threat of climate change and rising levels of diet-related disease we face many challenges too.\u201d Dimbleby\u2019s brief is to look at how a post-Brexit Britain will deliver \u201csafe, healthy, affordable food\u201d regardless of income, as well as examine sustainability of supply, jobs and the impact of the climate crisis. \u201cThere are urgent challenges with which we must grapple. Populations are growing, diet-related conditions are harming the lives of millions, and climate change is altering what our land will yield,\u201d said Dimbleby, who is also the founder of the Sustainable Restaurant Association. Aware of the struggles of celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver in effecting food changes in schools and hospitals, he said: \u201cI think if we do a good job there is a really good chance of landing something good. \u201cIf you look at the system, you see on the one hand extraordinary abundance of food and prices previous generations would not have dreamed of. But increasingly it is making many of us ill, and killing us and hitting those on lowest incomes, harming the environment and causing greenhouse gases. \u201cBut we can change that. We have not gone through a collapse of willpower in the human species. But I have no illusions about how hard it will be.\u201d Dimbleby said he hoped the review would lead to an ambitious and long-term rethink, even in the face of the continuing dominance of Brexit in parliament. \u201cWe have got to realign things so they will last 30 years out.\u201d One concern is the report falling by the wayside next year if its sponsor gets reshuffled in or out of the cabinet and Brexit continues to paralyse decision making. However, industry leaders hope it will bring lasting change. Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, said the food and farming alliance was \u201cexcited about the ideas, collaboration and optimism\u201d that the review had already started to generate. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the national strategy would build on the agriculture bill currently before parliament alongside the childhood obesity strategy and the forthcoming environment bill. Ian Wright, chief executive of theFood andDrink Federation, said people had taken food for granted over the past 70 years but \u201cin truth, it is a strategic national asset to be protected\u201d. The National Farmers\u2019 Union president, Minette Batters, said the review was long overdue. \u201cIt is crucial that this strategy delivers for everyone, from food producers to families across the country, regardless of their income,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
