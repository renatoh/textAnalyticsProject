Formerly known as TP Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou \u2013 TP standing for \"tout puissant\" or \"all powerful\", and Cotonou being the largest city in Benin \u2013 they started in the late 60s, recorded dozens of albums, but took decades to achieve international recognition. A series of compilation albums led to their eventual discovery by Western audiences, and the reformed band gave their first UK concert in 2009. This new album features several of those who played with Poly-Rhythmo in the 60s and 70s, and it's a rousing, varied affair. It continues their tradition of specialising in all styles, mixing Afrobeat with funk, jazz and local voodoo influences, here with help from celebrity supporters. Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo joins the stirring, funky revival of Gbeti Madjro, the new Malian star Fatoumata Diawara adds sturdy vocals to the brassy Mariage, and there's even an appearance by members of Franz Ferdinand on the rumbling finale, Lion Is Burning. It's a cheerful, stirring and perhaps deliberately unfocused set, but they sound even better live."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
