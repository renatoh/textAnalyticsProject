At the Halfpenny Green wine estate in Staffordshire, some 3,000 vines are producing a new variety of grape that the country\u2019s major winegrowers are hoping will transform British viticulture. The divico grape, imported from Switzerland, is not for making sparkling wine, which accounts for about 70% of all wine produced in England and Wales. Rather, it is to make a full-bodied red, which even the most optimistic, or perhaps deluded, enthusiasts for British wine have until now considered impossible. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put Britain\u2019s first divico vineyard in without a great deal of thought,\u201d said the estate\u2019s founder, Martin Vickers, who has been making wine in Staffordshire for 36 years. He first learned of the variety when attending a cool-climate wine symposium three years ago, and was impressed with its potential on a visit to Switzerland, where it has been developed as a hybrid variety over the past 15 years. Halfpenny, which planted the vines last year and expects to sell the first bottles of its new wine in 2022, is part of a consortium of producers in England, including Bolney Wine Estate, Nyetimber, Chapel Down and Gusbourne, which are backing trials of the grape being conducted by the horticultural research organisation, NIAB EMR, at Britain\u2019s only research vineyard in East Malling, Kent. \u201cRed wine accounts for only 5% of the UK\u2019s current production, but we believe divico now offers strong commercial prospects by producing quality red wines,\u201d said Dr Julien Lecourt, head of viticulture and wine research and development at NIAB EMR. Divico is attractive to British growers because it flowers in early June \u2013 late enough to avoid frosts and when temperatures are higher, allowing optimal pollination, improved yield and quality. Crucially, it is also naturally resistant to many diseases affecting grape crops, in particular powdery mildew. Other grape varieties used to make red wines have been trialled in England before. Some pinot noir wines have performed well in recent global tasting competitions. But Vickers was dubious as to whether these would really take off. \u201cA lot of the English pinot noirs I\u2019ve tasted are lacking in depth and colour and they are a little bit light. I don\u2019t think pinot noir in England is ever going to do it.\u201d However, he is more enthusiastic about the Swiss import. \u201cJust imagine if you could consistently produce a full-bodied red wine from England \u2013 there would be a huge market for it and this is the variety that could do it.\u201d Vickers will take a decision on whether to plant more divico vines in around 18 months\u2019 time. But already the early results look promising. Lecourt said tastings of last year\u2019s harvest in the Kent pilot, which involves collecting large volumes of data on the molecular structure of the grape to help understand its sugar content and acidity, had been encouraging. \u201cWe identified a very nice silky texture; the tannins are soft, like a good burgundy,\u201d Lecourt said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a very nice structure and the mouth was brilliant; you get very ripe fruits, like black cherry.\u201d This year, the harvest was pushed back a little later, resulting in a wine of greater complexity, said Lecourt, adding that the grape could be used to produce a range of different wines. \u201cDo we want something more gamay-like, like a good beaujolais, or do we want something more like a syrah or beaujolais nouveau?\u201d The UK wine industry is growing rapidly. There are now more than 500 vineyards and 164 wineries operating in Britain. English and Welsh wines are exported to 40 countries, and the area under vine in the UK has increased by 160% in the past 10 years to 7,000 acres. A record 3m vines were planted this year \u2013 almost double the number planted the previous year. At the current rate of growth, it is predicted that the UK could be producing 40m bottles by 2040. However chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier and bacchus \u2013 varieties that feature predominantly in sparkling and white wine \u2013 still account for three-quarters of all plantings in Britain, and most vineyards are located in the south of England. The introduction of the divico grape, however, could give succour to vineyards in more northern parts of the British Isles. \u201cThere are at least 100 vineyards north of us,\u201d Vickers said. \u201cThere\u2019s 10 in Yorkshire alone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
