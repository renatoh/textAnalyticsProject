But the years have passed and such is indeed the case, with hopes resting on Masar (2.25) to end that fruitless run. The colt\u2019s chance of doing so seems excellent. His third place in the Chesham, behind September and Nyaleti, looks like the best bit of form on offer. That was only the second start for this son of New Approach, out of a UAE Derby winner, so improvement after a further two months ought to be a given. James Doyle takes over from the injured William Buick. 1.50 Sandown With the Paul Midgley yard back among the winners, it may be worthwhile having a second look at Monsieur Joe, who has been given a chance by the handicapper. On his last visit to this track, in summer last year, he was just pipped in a Group Three. Here he gets a chance off 92, the lowest rating he has had for seven years. 2.10 Chester The consistent front-runner My Reward is of interest, from a handy low draw that will help him get to the early lead. He has gone close in much more valuable contests in his last three starts and the form of his recent York second to Magic Circle makes him the pick this time. He is only 1lb higher. 2.45 Chester Three times a winner from six visits to this unique circuit, Breakable has a favourable inside draw for a prominent racer. She was again seen to good effect last time when second in a big field at York\u2019s Ebor meeting. 3.00 Sandown Aljazzi appears the likely favourite for this Group Three but there is a distinct possibility that she was flattered by her second to Qemah at Royal Ascot, a performance far ahead of her previous efforts. A better bet may be the Sir Michael Stoute-trained five-year-old Intimation, who finished strongly after some trouble to be second at The Curragh on Sunday. A half-sister to the Summer Mile winner Mutakayyef, she has more to offer with Ryan Moore back in the plate. 3.15 Beverley According to one ratings system Kimberella has produced the three best efforts of his career since joining Richard Fahey this season and he might be the answer to a competitive Beverley Bullet. He did not quite get home over six furlongs in an Irish Group Three last time but looked unlucky at that level at Newcastle in the summer. Paul Hanagan, three times a winner on him this year, returns to the saddle. 3.35 Sandown A fair fourth in a Haydock Group Three last time, Euginio may have found the ground against him that day after heavy rain. He was previously a winner over this course and distance and should have more to offer.
