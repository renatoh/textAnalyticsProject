Neil Back, who has a more-than-colourful history with referees, was hardly likely to be any different, and the man was evidently seething over the performance of Rob Debney, even if he knows from bitter experience not to get too demonstrative when it comes to referee-bashing. \"The fact that the penalty count was 15-2 until the last 15 minutes meant I was again confused with a lot of those decisions,\" was about as far as he would go, although the anger on his face told a different story. He will be going through \"the usual channels\" in order to voice his displeasure to the authorities. He was not going through them during the match, though. Sitting just behind the press box, he railed long and loud at the injustices in the first half, even appealing at one point to the \"gentlemen of the press\" over one point of principle. This particular card-carrier would take issue with Back's penalty count, making it something more like 10-5 in Gloucester's favour at that point, but there is no doubt that penalties cost them the match, four successful strikes by Nicky Robinson between the 30th and 42nd minutes establishing the lead from which Leeds would never recover. Back was most distressed by Debney's interpretation of events at scrum time. It is true that penalties here are often the most unsatisfactory of all, so difficult to draw conclusions from the writhings of so many behemoths under pressure, so easy to jump to them. But there was no problem discerning the dynamic at one scrum a minute before half-time. Gloucester ruthlessly marched Leeds backwards, and thus arose the third of Robinson's four penalties for a 9-0 lead. Even Back remained silent for that one. So a comfortable enough victory for Gloucester, rounded off with a fine individual try from Robinson in the 69th minute, even if they secured it on the back of Debney's interventions. There were concerns for Gloucester, too, however, in the form of injuries to Mike Tindall and Gareth Delve, who hobbled off nursing a groin and ankle respectively. Neither will be fit for Gloucester's rearranged trip to Newcastle on Wednesday, but neither are their injuries thought to be too serious. Delve, meanwhile, yesterday confirmed that he is to join Danny Cipriani at Melbourne Rebels at the end of the season despite the No8's recent return to the Wales side. The injury to Leeds's hopes of survival may well be greater. It is all heading for a showdown with Worcester at Headingley at the end of April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
