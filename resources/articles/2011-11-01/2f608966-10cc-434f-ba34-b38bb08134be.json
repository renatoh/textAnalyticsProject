On February 28, 2001 at Villa Park, in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's first match as England manager, the Chelsea midfielder was sent on as a half-time substitute for Paul Scholes. Within two minutes Sol Campbell was nodding down his inswinging corner kick for Emile Heskey to volley the goal that made it 2-0. Twenty minutes later Ugo Ehiogu headed in a similar corner to complete the scoring in what seemed like an encouraging but unsurprising outcome. How things have changed. Stopping the new-model Spain, Lampard said on Friday, is probably the most difficult job in football. \"We're under no illusions. We're playing against one of the best international teams of many a year, certainly since I can remember. It's a mixture of being aware of that but also trying to show what we can do. No one's saying we're on the level of Spain in terms of what we've done in the last four to six years, but it's an opportunity to show, in one game, what we might be capable of. Then we need to build on that. \"It's a case of not letting them dominate games as Spain and Barcelona do so often. You have to believe in yourselves and see their weaknesses. If we can win the ball back from them and get our front men away, with the pace in our team \u2026we have to be bold, we have to stand up. We're doing that more at Chelsea these days. We're playing from the back \u2013 it's not something we might have done in the past. If I lose the ball, I lose it trying to do the right thing. That's the way it is. Being a friendly, we'll have an opportunity to do that.\" When Lampard says that he will be proud to lead England out at Wembley for the first time, the instinct is not to treat his claim as the automated soundbite it might be from other mouths. On Saturday he is no more than a stop-gap captain, as he was in a 2-1 victory over Denmark in Copenhagen nine months ago. But answering reporters' questions a few minutes after Fabio Capello had taken him aside following the end of the morning's training session and told him that he would be wearing the captain's armband in place of John Terry, he spoke with the sort of lucidity, perceptiveness and \u2013 except when avoiding the matter of the investigation into Terry's alleged racist comments \u2013 candour that have rarely been heard from the more regular holders of the office in recent years. Although England have failed to score a goal against Spain since that night at Villa Park, Lampard also has important Champions League experiences against Barcelona to help shape his approach to a game which may feature as many as eight players from the Catalan club. In 2009 he was part of the Chelsea team who came away from the Nou Camp with a goalless draw before going out at Stamford Bridge after a 1-1 draw that they will always claim amounted to floodlight robbery. \"We'd seen them play a lot of teams who'd try and play their style against them, which is impossible,\" he said. \"They'd try and press them right up the pitch and win the ball back. We stayed in the middle of the pitch, waited for them to come a little bit, we worked our socks off to get tight, and when we won the ball we countered. \"I've played them twice at Stamford Bridge and felt the same, the other time being when we beat them 4-2 a few years before. Our pitch is quite tight and we could put the pressure on them. The Nou Camp is different, it's massive. Wembley's big as well, unfortunately.\" At 33, and on the eve of his 90th cap, Lampard refuses to consider calling time on his England career that has veered from a performance at Euro 2004 which earned him a place in Uefa's team of the tournament to abuse from the fans at Wembley in 2007. \"Probably the only time I'd think of it would be if I wasn't getting picked enough, and it was common knowledge,\" he said. \"It wouldn't even be worth saying it then. Or if it was beneficial for me to have those breaks, in terms of prolonging my Chelsea career. When you're younger you think you'll maybe stop at a certain age. But, as I've got older, I've started to realise you're a long time retired. I'd be sitting there wishing I'd pushed that little bit harder and got another 50 caps.\" Meanwhile, he has been struck by the effect on the squad of an infusion of young blood, in the shape of Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Phil Jones. \"The Sturridges and the Welbecks, they really do bring a youthful pace and speed to their play. They can add an edge and make something happen. \"I do feel that's different. These young boys coming through bring in a carefree attitude. Sometimes, the years of playing for England can make you see things different. But they're fearless. Jones is fearless. Welbeck is fearless. Sturridge is fearless. It can raise the level of us all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
