In a letter to lawmakers CBO director Phillip Swagel projected the virus will reduce US economic output by 3% through 2030, a loss of $7.9tn. \u201cBusiness closures and social distancing measures are expected to curtail consumer spending, while the recent drop in energy prices is projected to severely reduce US investment in the energy sector,\u201d Swagel wrote in response to an inquiry from Senator Chuck Schumer. \u201cRecent legislation will, in CBO\u2019s assessment, partially mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions.\u201d Since the pandemic hit the US trillions of dollars have been poured into the economy via government stimulus programs and actions by the Federal Reserve. But the moves have not stopped unemployment soaring to levels unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. So far some 40 million Americans have lost their jobs and on Friday the labor department is expected to announce the unemployment rate reached 20% in May, up from 14.7% in April and just 4.4% in March. Congress is currently debating another $3tn aid package and the renewal of several federal aid programs that are set to expire, including a temporary boost to unemployment benefits that will lapse at the end of July. Republicans have balked at the size of the new stimulus program. Schumer seized on the CBO release to press for action. \u201cIn order to avoid the risk of another Great Depression, the Senate must act with a fierce sense of urgency to make sure that everyone in America has the income they need to feed their families and put a roof over their heads,\u201d said Schumer in a statement. \u201cThe American people cannot afford to wait another month for the Senate to pass legislation. They need our help now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
