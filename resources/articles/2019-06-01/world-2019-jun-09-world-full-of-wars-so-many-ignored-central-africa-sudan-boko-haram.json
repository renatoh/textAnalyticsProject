In a warring world full of conflict, the country\u2019s troubles barely rate a mention. That\u2019s short-sighted. As Yemen shows, today\u2019s local difficulties have a habit of becoming tomorrow\u2019s international crises. Long-running tensions between Cameroon\u2019s French and English-speaking communities came to a head last week with the arrest of at least 350 members of the main opposition party, whose leader has been jailed since January. Human Rights Watch accused security forces of using \u201cexcessive and indiscriminate force\u201d. Political repression may be the least of Cameroon\u2019s worries. According to a new Norwegian Refugee Council report, Cameroon is the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis. Since 2016, conflict between government forces and non-state armed groups has forced 450,000 people from their homes. According to the report, \u201c780,000 children are out of school. Hundreds of villages have been burned down, tens of thousands of people are hiding in the bush with no humanitarian support, and attacks are taking place every day.\u201d Both the government and separatists are accused of \u201chorrific human rights violations\u201d. Though the specifics vary, Cameroon does not suffer in isolation. Its instability reflects that of its neighbours \u2013 Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic \u2013 and the wider Sahel region. Across this vast area, home to numerous other under-reported conflicts, the developed world\u2019s present-day neglect is sowing a poisonous future harvest. In Nigeria, the notorious Boko Haram insurgency has been pegged back. But the rise of less-known Isis affiliates, such as so-called Islamic State West Africa, and regional jihadist groups is a cause of growing concern, says the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. About 2.4 million people in the Lake Chad basin are displaced. \u201cAlthough the Nigerian military has regained control in parts of the north-east, civilians in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger continue to be affected by grave violations of human rights, widespread sexual and gender-based violence, forced recruitment and suicide bombings,\u201d the UN\u2019s refugee agency says. Investigations by the New Humanitarian project suggest the Sahel emergency is intensifying rapidly. \u201cA surge in violence in recent months in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left more than 440,000 people displaced and 5,000 dead as militants \u2013 some with links to al-Qaida and Isis \u2013 extend their grip across the region,\u201d it reported in May. The ramifications of this advance are dire. \u201cAs they gain ground, the jihadists are stoking conflicts between different ethnic groups \u2026 putting the region\u2019s entire social fabric into question. Cycles of inter-communal violence are now claiming more lives and uprooting more people than direct jihadist attacks,\u201d New Humanitarian says. Neglected or forgotten conflicts are by no means confined to sub-Saharan Africa. Nor are political, ethnic or religious tensions the only factors. Conflicts are often rooted in the failure of authoritarian, incompetent or corrupt governments to protect their citizens, as in Sudan. Struggling communities may fear state security forces more than they fear local militias, as in Kashmir. Yet the inattention of wealthy countries, coupled with the damaging impact of their economic and cultural behaviour, are powerful factors, too. Interventionism, and escalation of local conflicts by the co-opting of proxy forces, are on the rise, as seen in Libya where rival states back opposing sides. At the same time, external diplomatic mediation and third-party peace efforts are declining even as the total number of conflicts rises, according to Oslo\u2019s Peace Research Institute. The western world has long fixated, for example, on the Israel-Palestine peace process. By contrast, no comparable commitment is seen in Somalia, ravaged by decades of conflict. Aggravating this neglect are inadequate, under-fire western foreign aid and assistance budgets. UN humanitarian appeals are routinely under-funded. Aid can become a political football, as happened recently in Venezuela. Meanwhile, environmental degradation linked to the climate crisis is increasing poverty and inequality, helping to drive conflict. Climate change, specifically drought, played a key role in sparking the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, where farmers were pitted against herders. It is a factor now in Iraq, Egypt and other areas of the Middle East where competition for ever scarcer water supplies is intensifying. It is a factor, too, in a resurgence of preventable diseases, as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The link to conflict is evident. \u201cEnvironmental degradation is starting to reverberate and affect economic growth,\u201d a Brookings Institution study of sustainability declared last month: \u201cDisasters triggered by weather and climate-related hazards were responsible for thousands of deaths and $320bn in losses in 2017 \u2026 Water stress linked to climate change is already contributing to migration, which in turn can lead to conflict.\u201d According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, political violence and protest surged worldwide last year. \u201cThese trends showed few signs of stopping in 2019,\u201d it says. In its list of looming flashpoints, relatively neglected conflicts in the Sahel, South Sudan, the southern Philippines and Myanmar feature alongside better-reported wars in Syria and Afghanistan. The International Crisis Group casts its net even wider. Rising tensions, from multiple causes, in Benin, Togo, Sri Lanka, Honduras, Nicaragua, Kosovo and Iran all need to be carefully watched, too, it says in its June CrisisWatch report. In one sense, it\u2019s an impossible task. In another sense, greater focus on conflict prevention and resolution in everyone\u2019s interest. The scale of the challenge merely underscores an inescapable 21st-century reality: rather than question multilateralist approaches, the international community needs to work together more closely than ever if, collectively, it hopes to survive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
