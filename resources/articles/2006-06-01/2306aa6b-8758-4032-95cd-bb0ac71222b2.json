Are there any exercises I can do while sitting on my sofa, glued to the World Cup? You can tone your body. Here's how. Arm work: this can be done seated with a couple of filled half-litre water bottles - think front and side raises and target the triceps with tricep dips. Slow your movements to increase intensity. For inner thighs: sit with good posture on the floor facing a wooden chair. Extend your legs in front of you with a leg on the outside of each chair leg, ankles touching the chair. Squeeze your legs together, using your inner thighs. Hold for eight counts and repeat 12-20 times. For outer thighs: sit upright with good posture, feet hip distance apart, flat on the floor. Tie an exercise band firmly round the mid point of your thighs. Using outer thighs, press your knees out to the side. Hold for five, return to start and repeat 12 times. For waist: sit on the floor with legs apart, back straight. Sit on a small cushion to help your spine alignment if you tend to roll back. Lift arms out at the side, level with your shoulders. Keeping the spine tall, rotate at the waist. Keep abdominals tight, rotate back to the start position, then rotate to the other side. Repeat 12-16 times. For abdominals: sit erect on the edge of your chair, arms straight with your hands flat on chair. Squeeze your legs together, lift your heels until your toes barely touch the floor. Contract your abs gently and draw your navel and the sides of your torso in towards your spine. Exhale and lift your feet a few inches off the floor. Inhale and lower your toes. Repeat 20 times.
