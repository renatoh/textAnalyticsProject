The hot-shot is still being troubled by the ankle injury which kept him out of France's friendly international with Australia. He could also miss next Wednesday's Champions League clash with Deportivo La Coruna in Spain. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger told www.arsenal.com: \"Thierry will be out for the game on Saturday, and there is a slight chance for Wednesday. But even Wednesday could be short. He is not ready for Saturday.\" However, Wenger revealed Fredrik Ljungberg is likely to make the derby following the shoulder injury he sustained against Charlton. The French boss added he was never tempted to leave Sol Campbell - returning to White Hart Lane for the first time since his summer departure from Tottenham - out of the side. Wenger added: \"Sol did everything right. He respected his contract and left at the end - not guided by greed or any speculation or any bad behaviour towards Spurs. \"In my opinion he has shown great respect to Spurs by staying till the end of his contract.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
