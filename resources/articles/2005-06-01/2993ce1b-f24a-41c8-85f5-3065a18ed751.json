It won't affect the chemical properties of an ingredient, but I love a bit of magic or story-telling as much as anyone else. Last week I wrote about argan oil, and why I love it - and that hasn't changed even though I know that the stones from which it's made have not passed through the digestive tract of a goat, as the myth would have us believe. I recently came across another ingredient with a wonderful tale attached. Several 'rare' coffees have come on the market of late; they are, of course, very expensive. The story behind one goes like this: the coffee fruit, known as a berry, is a favourite food of the civet, which lives in the forests of Indonesia. These cats are themselves pretty rare. Anyway, the cats eat the coffee berries, but, unlike those Moroccan goats, their digestive systems cannot cope with the beans in the middle, so they regurgitate them and spit them out. Local children have the enviable task of collecting civet sick and sorting out the berries, which are then roasted and ground for coffee. I was given a pack of the stuff the other day, and the aroma had the most wonderful chocolate note to it. But when I made coffee with it, it was very bitter, and packed enough caffeine to make me run a marathon in my sleep. I'm afraid that this is my last column for Weekend. I've enjoyed writing them very much, and I want to thank everyone who has followed them and written to me, whatever their point of view. Any debate about cooking and food is a good thing. \u00b7 Heston Blumenthal is chef/proprietor of the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
