I was showing my friend each grave, telling him about the person whose name is etched into the gravestone. He gasped as he realised that some gravestones had more than one name attached to them. It\u2019s not a usual scenario, but then, is any part of what happened at Grenfell usual? We span two areas of the cemetery, visiting those we\u2019ve lost, ending our visit by making prayers for peace, patience and blessings for each person who is no longer with us. A few days later, just last Sunday, I received several calls from people alerting me to a fire that had broken out at flats in Barking. Thankfully, no lives were lost, but life for all those who used to live there had changed \u2026 their possessions were destroyed within minutes. The National Zakat Foundation\u2019s project in Grenfell ended earlier this year, as many of the families whom we advocated for are now able to manage independently, and we felt that our role in providing closure, advocacy and relief had been fulfilled. So while life is not and never will be \u201cusual\u201d again for many of our families, some have made positive and progressive steps. You don\u2019t move on from Grenfell, but you can move forward. The question most people want answering is what has changed since the fire? Has anything? In honesty, even with all the great work that the community, organisations and charities have done, for the families still living in tower blocks with cladding and aesthetics that may be pleasing to the eye, but harmful to life, nothing has changed. \u2022 Zain Miah is the founder and project manager for the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit, a project run by the National Zakat Foundation that supported victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Cathy Long: \u2018This community may be quiet. But it is making its voice heard\u2019 The burned shell of the building that used to be home for so many is wrapped in white, and the green heart that became the symbol of Grenfell sits at the top. The remnants of teddies and flowers left as memorials still hang from railings near the tube station. For those unused to it, the sight can be shocking. And it should be. Many of the survivors do not want the tower ever to be torn down, but for it to be left as a permanent reminder on the London skyline. For those of us living nearby, the daily presence is perhaps important but not as necessary. We cannot forget. For me it\u2019s important always to think of those who lived there \u2013 the living and the dead \u2013 but to do so in a way that inspires us to fight for change rather than let what happened overwhelm us. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, the anger was visceral. And it wasn\u2019t just anger about the fire. It was fury about the way that the community had been treated by authorities. The fire was seen in the context of a political attitude. Local people had protested about plans to hand the lease of the much-loved library building on Ladbroke Grove to the local prep school, about the local further education college being under threat of closure, and they had tried to rescue their pub, the Kensington Park Hotel, AKA KPH, the lease having been bought by developers. It closed just before the fire. As one longstanding resident put it: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken everything away from us. They just don\u2019t listen, and this is the result.\u201d Since the fire, the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea has engaged in numerous listening exercises. They\u2019ve gone into overdrive with forums and public meetings. Their ears must be hurting. But are they hearing us? Over the course of the last year the library has been saved, a report into the college was damning about the previous regime, and last week I had my first pint in the reopened KPH for two years. Most of the changes have come from local people though. While the public inquiry slowly rumbles on, the community itself been listening. A food bank at the Methodist church and a homeless shelter and kitchen at Al Manaar mosque have been established because of what faith leaders have described as a new-found confidence gained from responding to the fire, and an understanding of what was needed. The previously neglected Henry Dickens community centre is now a hive of activity. Kids on the Green, a creative arts project set up after the fire, continues to grow and has moved into new premises. This community may be quiet. But it is making its voice heard. \u2022 Cathy Long lives locally to Grenfell and was a volunteer in the aftermath of the fire Lucy Masoud: \u2018I find it utterly depressing that some blame firefighters for the loss of life\u2019 It has been 24 months since 72 men, women and children burned to death in their homes on a warm summer\u2019s night in west London. As a former firefighter who was based at Chelsea fire station during the fire, and knows the area and community well, the word Grenfell haunts me to this day. So much and yet so little has changed since London\u2019s largest loss of life since the second world war. One of things that has changed is that many of my firefighter colleagues and friends who attended Grenfell on the night of the fire are now suffering terribly from PTSD. Some have been forced to leave the job they love as they are unable to come to terms with what they saw on that night and how, despite their heroic best efforts, there were people they were unable to save. Lives of those who lived in Grenfell and its surrounding areas have been changed forever and the hurt and anger they feel still runs deep. What has not changed is that still we have buildings in this country that are covered in flammable cladding. What has not changed is that we still we treat our social housing tenants like second-class citizens and ignore their safety concerns. What has not changed is that still cuts are being made to the fire service, making our job of saving lives even harder. Some are now attempting to shift blame on to the firefighters for the loss of life at Grenfell. I find this utterly depressing. What saddens me the most about this is that by blaming firefighters, it allows those truly responsible off the hook. Those who signed off on the cladding, those who ignored the tenants\u2019 concerns about fire risks, those who imposed massive cuts to the fire service will all be forgotten as long as the narrative is to try to blame the brave men and women who tried desperately to save the victims of Grenfell Tower. On Friday, myself and hundreds of firefighters from across the country will be attending the Grenfell silent walk to remember those 72 lives lost. And today, like every day since 14 June 2017, when I look up at that tower all I will see is a mass grave standing tall in west London, and it will still take my breath away. \u2022 Lucy Masoud is a trade unionist and former firefighter Daniel Renwick: \u2018The wounds that opened two years ago have only deepened\u2019 When a senior Metropolitan police officer says there is \u201cno guarantee\u201d of criminal charges over the fire in the week of the two-year commemorations, it feels like gaslighting. It\u2019s a gut punch when a community champion is locked up as we come together today. Reis Morris was imprisoned after apparently threatening a fire officer \u2013 but his incarceration for eight weeks is but one grave injustice. The wounds that opened two years ago have only deepened. Hundreds of thousands remain at risk of death. Brexit remains the excuse, but its drive towards deregulation presents real and present danger of things getting worse. Grenfell United is a light in these bleak times, fighting to ensure what happened is not repeated. But buildings continue to be made into tinderboxes by corporations that evade justice. To end the cladding scandal, we need to end the market state. The right to life should come above all. The Barking fire last week was a warning. Push people into these conditions and soon enough you\u2019ll have an army of angry people, just like Reis. If the state don\u2019t want the smoke, it must do its job and stop the fires. There can be no justice for Grenfell unless and until we join the campaigns \u2013 led by Grenfell United, UK Cladding Action Group and others \u2013 to end this scandalous contempt for human life. And that\u2019s the minimum requirement. Full-spectrum justice demands so much more, in all senses of the word, and we want it all. \u2022 Daniel Renwick is a videographer and writer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
