Everton conceded five goals against their local rivals for the first time since 1982 as they slipped into the relegation zone with an eighth defeat in 11 league games. Divock Origi and Sadio Man\u00e9 punished a shambolic defensive display by the visitors as Liverpool set a new club record of 32 league games unbeaten and recorded their 100th Premier League victory under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. It could prove to be Silva\u2019s final game as Everton manager, with Moyes favourite to replace the beleaguered Portuguese coach and Tim Cahill being considered as his assistant. \u201cI am not the right person to talk to you about the situation, I cannot answer to you,\u201d said Silva when asked if he feared the sack. \u201cSince I joined the club and until the last day I am here I will always be 100% professional, giving my best every single day. I understand why the questions are coming. If we are winning all the games, you are not asking them. It is not for me to take those questions. I don\u2019t like to talk after every single match about my future.\u201d Silva admitted Everton were \u201cnot good enough\u201d and conceded a series of dreadful goals from a defensive perspective. \u201cWe have to do better, be more brave and win more challenges,\u201d he added. \u201cWe knew they would make runs in behind but we were not strong enough. It was not good enough, what we did tonight.\u201d Klopp, by contrast, could savour another derby victory after making five changes to the team that started against Brighton on Saturday. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cIt was really good, especially in the circumstances I created pretty much myself with the line-up. We had to make changes. It was clear we needed fresh legs and what the boys did in this difficult game was exceptional.\u201d Klopp\u2019s century of league wins as Liverpool manager arrived in 159 games, quicker than any of his predecessors. \u201cIt is not a number I\u2019m interested in,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s 300 points, that\u2019s cool, but only 43 points helps us this season. The boys are the reason for the wins. It\u2019s just a number, it\u2019s cool but it\u2019s necessary too. We have to keep winning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
