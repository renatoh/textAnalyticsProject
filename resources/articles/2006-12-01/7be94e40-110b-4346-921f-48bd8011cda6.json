Greg Page, lead singer and founding member of pre-school entertainers the Wiggles, is quitting the Australian quartet, citing a debilitating illness. Millions of children across North America, Europe, Australia and Taiwan have sung along with the yellow-jerseyed Page and his band's catchy tunes and cast of characters, including Wags the Dog and Dorothy the Dinosaur. Last year, the unlikely thirtysomething foursome earned AUD$50m (\u00a320m) to become Australia's highest earning entertainers, ahead of Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe. Page, 34, said he had been diagnosed with a chronic condition called orthostatic intolerance. While not life-threatening, he said it caused his heart to fail to pump enough blood around his body when he stands up, making it difficult to keep up with the band's strenuous performances and global touring schedule. \"This emotional decision was one which was very difficult, as I have dedicated almost half my life to the Wiggles,\" he said in a statement. \"I will miss the other guys very much, as well as seeing all the children in the audiences.\" Page was a trainee teacher in Sydney and member of a struggling rock band, the Cockroaches, with university friends Anthony Field and Murray Cook when they decided to perform songs for children in 1991. With the addition of Jeff Fatt, and the inspired uniform of colour-coded tops, the Wiggles built up a lucrative entertainment empire. Rejected by Australia's public broadcaster the ABC, which told them they did not communicate well with children, the group built up a loyal fan base by taking their tunes and characters on the road. After their TV show was broadcast by the Disney Channel in 1999, the band conquered America, where parents appreciated their family themes and status as wholesome role models. Their bank balances swelled by the sale of CDs and merchandise, the band garnered celebrity fans such as John Travolta and Sarah Jessica Parker, and beat Bruce Springsteen's record by playing 12 sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York in 2003. Page's non-appearance during much of this year's US tour caused controversy among some parents who complained they were not informed beforehand. The departure of the Wiggles' songwriter and magic trick specialist is a blow to the group's planned assault on lucrative markets in India and China, but the remaining Wiggles insisted they would continue. \"We will miss Greg as a superb singer and songwriter, but mostly we'll miss him on the road as a friend,\" said Murray Cook, the red Wiggle. Cook said he hoped children would not notice the change, with Page's understudy, Sam Moran, a backing dancer who has performed with the Wiggles for nine years, inheriting the yellow turtleneck. \"Children tend to centre on one thing so if he's wearing the yellow skivvy [turtleneck] - he's pretty much Greg,\" said Cook. Anthony Field, the blue Wiggle, struggled to contain his sadness as the band launched their latest Australian tour in Perth. \"It's surreal that Greg's not going to be with us, very sad,\" he said. Wiggly facts \u00b7 The Wiggles have been Australia's top-earning entertainers for two years, ahead of Nicole Kidman and AC/DC combined. \u00b7 They have sold more than 17m DVDs and videos and 4m CDs around the world. \u00b7 They performed to more than 250,000 people in America in November 2005. \u00b7 Australian fast bowler Brett Lee performed with the Wiggles recently when they played a game of cricket on a TV show. Lee did not take a wicket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
