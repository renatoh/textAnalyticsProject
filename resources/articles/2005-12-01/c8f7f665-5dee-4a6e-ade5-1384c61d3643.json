Walford rode Kingscliff to the most valuable success of the eight-year-old's nine-race career when he beat a field that included Kicking King and Beef Or Salmon in the Betfair Chase at Haydock last month. The victory also put Kingscliff into the frame for the \u00a31m bonus offered by the sponsor if he can follow up in both the King George and then the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Kingscliff, who finished second to Kicking King in the King George last season, has been jostling with the Gold Cup winner for favouritism for this year's race, and Sandown's stiff uphill finish should certainly bring his stamina into play more fully than the short, flat run-in at Kempton, the King George's usual home. However, Alner may now be forced to find a new jockey for Kingscliff as he attempts to take the middle leg of the seven-figure treble. \"He's got a hairline fracture, which you can hardly see on the x-ray,\" Sally Alner, the trainer's wife, said yesterday. \"He's back at home now and he's not going to move for five days because he wants to get better. He's not going to move an inch [but] his chances of being fit for Kingscliff in the King George are 50-50.\" If Walford does not recover in time, jockeys of the quality of Tony McCoy - who returns to action today after suffering a viral infection - and Richard Johnson, McCoy's closest pursuer in the title race, are possible replacements, along with Andrew Thornton, who rode Kingscliff in five of his first seven starts. The decision will ultimately lie with Arnie Sendell, Kingscliff's owner, who said yesterday that he had accepted an offer of \u00a3750,000 for the chaser earlier this year, only to pull out of the deal the following day. \"At first they offered half a million but they kept upping the offer until I accepted,\" Sendell said. \"Then the next morning I rang Robert at a quarter to six and told him I had changed my mind. I hadn't slept a wink all night.\" Martin Pipe, whose losing streak ended at 47 runners when Lough Derg took a novice chase at Exeter yesterday, said yesterday that his King George entry Our Vic is on the mend after suffering an injury at Cheltenham on Saturday. \"He pulled some ligaments landing over one of the early fences, but Mary Bromiley has been treating him and hopefully he'll be back before too long,\" the champion trainer said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
