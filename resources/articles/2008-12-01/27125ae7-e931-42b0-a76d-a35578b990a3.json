Under Illinois law the governor of Obama's home state can appoint the president-elect's successor but he apparently left the aide in no doubt that his blessing would come at a price. A seat in the Senate, he explained, is \"a fucking valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing\". The remarkable conversation was one of several prosecutors said had been recorded by the FBI before the governor was arrested today, charged with effectively attempting to sell Obama's seat. Such brazen and profanity-laced exchanges were typical for Blagojevich, who, according to a lengthy FBI affadavit, held multiple conversations about the seat with several advisers, consultants and fundraisers for Obama as well as five contenders for the job, reviewing his options like a market trader. He weighed up various prospects: an ambassadorship or a cabinet post - possibly health secretary - a lucrative private sector job, an appointment to a corporate board for his wife, immediate cash payment, or even the establishment of a non-profit foundation in his name with $15m (\u00a310m) in seed money from billionaire Warren Buffet and other donors. Blagojevich, a Democrat, also thought about making his own run for the White House in 2016. There is no suggestion that Obama or members of his transition team did anything wrong. Indeed, at one point Blagojevich is furious at the Obama camp's unwillingness to meet his demands. In a two-hour conference call with Obama advisers in Washington and Chicago on November 10, Blagojevich apparently erupts in frustration at their refusal to pay him for appointing the president-elect's preferred candidate. \"Fuck him. For nothing? Fuck him,\" Blagojevich says. He calls Obama a \"motherfucker\". Obama reacted to Blagojevich's arrest saying: \"Obviously, like the rest of the people of Illinois, I am saddened and sobered by the news that came out of the US attorney's office today. But as this is an ongoing investigation involving the governor, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on the issue at this time.\" But news organisations today began identifying prospective Senate candidates and members of the presidential team who had had conversations with the governor, and who are identified in the affidavit only by initials. Those contacts could be politically damaging to Obama. In one conversation, deputy governor A tells Blagojevich his coal background might make him a possible candidate for energy secretary. In the wiretaps, Blagojevich is overheard apparently discussing an offer of $500,000 from a potential candidate for the seat. The governor also spoke of keeping alive the prospect he might appoint himself - in order to get a higher price. The day after the election, Blagojevich allegedly told an Obama adviser that he was adamant about getting paid for choosing Obama's preferred candidate. \"I've got this thing and it's fucking golden, and, uh, uh, I'm just not giving it up for fuckin' nothing. I'm not gonna do it. And, and I can always use it. I can parachute me there.\" Blagojevich, 51, was first elected in 2002 on a promise to clean up after a Republican governor, George Ryan, who is now serving a six-year sentence for fraud, extortion, racketeering, and money laundering. He, and his chief of staff, John Harris, were charged with soliciting bribes and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud after their arrests today. Blagojevich was under investigation well before Obama's election opened up the possibility of appointing a successor to his Senate seat. \"The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering,\" the US attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said. \"Blagojevich put a 'for sale' sign on the naming of a United States senator.\" He told a press conference Blagojevich had brought politics in Illinois to a new low. \"The conduct would make Lincoln roll over in his grave,\" Fitzgerald said. The authorities set out a raft of other allegations against Blagojevich, accusing him of demanding $500,000 in campaign funds from a cement contractor for the state's $1.8bn highway toll system. The governor is also accused of making demands on a children's hospital which got $8m state funds. When its chief executive did not give Blagojevich $50,000 he tried to cut off funds. He also allegedly threatened to withhold state funds from a stadium owned by the publishing company of the Chicago Tribune, which went into bankruptcy this week, unless the newspapers sacked members of the editorial board who had criticised him. The Illinois state legislature plans to convene next week to discuss removing Blagojevich's power to appoint Obama's replacement, instead convening a special election, according to local media reports. It is unclear how quickly that special election would be held, but Democrats are likely to need all their congressional seats filled by next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
