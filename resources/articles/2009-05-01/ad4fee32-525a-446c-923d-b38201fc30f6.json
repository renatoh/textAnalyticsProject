The John Dunlop-trained colt proved he was still on the upgrade when beating Wells Lyrical with something in hand at Ripon last time and if the handicapper could have another go at the weights for this early-closing race he would certainly be carrying more. He acts on any ground so will not mind if the rain in the North-West eases the going and looks as if he will improve again for the step up in trip. The selection also has a fair draw at a track where the stalls position is all-important. Amerigo, who finished in front of him last year, has not had similar luck and is drawn wide but is feared along with Daraahem, who has been gelded since his last run and has always been highly thought of. Horses who have run well in this unique event regularly come back and figure prominently again. Som Tala and Tilt, both placed last year, will have their supporters but the pair are higher in the ratings than last term and on long losing runs. Harbinger (4.35) ran a very eye-catching race first time out for Sir Michael Stoute in an event at Newmarket that should work out well and looks a winner waiting to happen. He is just preferred to the similarly promising Calypso Bay in the final race of the day at Chester. Michael Jarvis is in typically excellent early-season form and can land a double at the meeting with Hidden Brief (2.15) and Kings Destiny (4.00). Ron Cox's tip of the day Sohraab 3.15 Chester The importance of the draw cannot be exaggerated at Chester and anything drawn above eight in sprints faces a difficult task winning at this tight track. Sohraab has a very favourable berth in stall four in the five-furlong handicap and looks poised to take advantage of that. He looked to have improved again when second at Newbury last time and races here off just a 1lb higher mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
