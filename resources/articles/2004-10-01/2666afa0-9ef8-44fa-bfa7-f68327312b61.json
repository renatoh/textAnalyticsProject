The Guardian associates itself with the following statement from the writer. \"Charlie Brooker apologises for any offence caused by his comments relating to President Bush in his TV column, Screen Burn. The views expressed in this column are not those of the Guardian. Although flippant and tasteless, his closing comments were intended as an ironic joke, not as a call to action - an intention he believed regular readers of his humorous column would understand. He deplores violence of any kind.\" \u00b7 A photograph of a yellow wagtail on page 11, October 22, in a report about the decline of wild birds on British farmland, showed a variant found in continental Europe. Britain's yellow wagtail has a paler head than its continental cousin. \u00b7 The obituary of the Indonesian politician Dr Subandrio (page 31, September 10) mentioned \"a fleeting visit by Henry Kissinger in 1965, as President Nixon's unofficial adviser\". Richard Nixon did not take office as president, and Kissinger was not his assistant for national security affairs until 1969; on his 1965 trip, Kissinger was acting as an unofficial representative for Nixon and other anti-communist US politicians. \u00b7 A comment piece on page 24, October 20, mentioned \"families wracked by ... gambling addiction\". As the Guardian stylebook points out, wrack is seaweed. Racked is the correct word. Frequently misspelled words: Amsterdam's airport is Schiphol, not Schipol (Letters, page 27, October 21). \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
