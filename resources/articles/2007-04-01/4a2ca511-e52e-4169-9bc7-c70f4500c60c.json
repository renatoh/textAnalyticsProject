The Giants remain at the foot of Super League but are now only a point adrift of their nearest rivals, Salford, and appear more than capable of continuing their rise in the coming weeks. With Ryan Hudson deployed at loose forward and assisted by their excellent hooker Brad Drew, Huddersfield had plenty of options around the play-the-balls and used them all to the full, establishing a handy 22-8 half-time lead. Indeed, with their powerful forwards Andy Raleigh, Eorl Crabtree and Steve Snitch punching holes in the Wolves defence, they looked more like a play-off side than one continually looking over their shoulders at the prospect of relegation. They also withstood a spirited Warrington comeback after the interval, when Lee Briers inspired his young team-mates to close to six points. But the boot of Huddersfield's captain, Chris Thorman, proved to be decisive, seven goals from as many attempts seeing his team home. \"Easter's been good - I got plenty of eggs and we're pleased with how we've played,\" said Jon Sharp, whose side beat Wakefield 28-6 on Good Friday. \"There has been a turnaround in results but performance-wise we've had confirmation that what we've been doing is right.\" Warrington's coach, Paul Cullen, refused to use the absences of several key players - plus further injuries to Chris Bridge and Vinnie Anderson - as excuses. \"That wasn't an issue before the game and it won't be one after. We created enough chances but haven't taken them - that's the feeling in the changing room.\" After an early Thorman penalty, Drew waltzed through a huge hole in the home defence after shaping to kick. Although Warrington responded through their makeshift second-row Henry Fa'afili, Huddersfield scored twice more before the interval. Crabtree stormed over for a remarkable effort from 30 metres before Drew and Shane Elford combined to send Martin Aspinwall over in the corner. Warrington's revival started less than two minutes into the second half, when Martin Gleeson crossed out wide, and an unlikely comeback looked possible when Briers kicked on the first tackle to create Fa'afili's second. But Thorman's seventh goal - after Fa'afili had been harshly penalised while in possession - eased their nerves and completed the scoring. \"There were two facets to the game,\" Sharp added. \"We showed we have plenty of skill and enthusiasm with the ball and in the last few minutes we saw a team particularly determined to defend their line. We showed why we are one of the best defensive teams in the game.\" Warrington Wolves Reardon; Barnett, Martin Gleeson, Bridge, Grose; Clarke, Briers; Pickersgill, Mark Gleeson, Rauhihi, Fa'afili, Wainwright, Anderson.
