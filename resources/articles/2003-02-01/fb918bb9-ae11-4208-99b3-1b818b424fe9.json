I had spent the end of 1989 travelling across the former Communist countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany and returned with a fascination for this melancholy part of the world. Kavan was a moody but impressive character, who had spent the Communist years smuggling books and magazines into Czechoslovakia and was now preparing for a career in politics in the fledgling democracy. I fould him all the more impressive because he had managed to maintain a position on the Left of the political spectrum while remaining robustly anti-Communist. I spent most of my time doing menial administration in a cramped and chaotic office in the back of Kavan's house, sending faxes, addressing envolopes and inputting weighty articles from then obscure dissident writers such as Petr Uhl and Adam Michnik. Uhl is now a prominent journalist and worked as a human rights commissioner for the Czech government and Michnik is the editor-in-chief of the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. Negative press reports about Kavan had begun to emerge when I was working at East European Reporter. The Observer's John Sweeney published a damaging article suggesting Kavan had endangered a BBC journalist during one of his smuggling trips. Out of loyalty to Jan I wrote to Sweeney suggesting the incident was probably caused by poor organisation rather than malice. Jan was always crazily busy and constitutionally disorganised. It remains a mystery to me how he was able to run a ministry let alone the UN General Assembly. In all the scandals and controversies that have blighted his career I have always assumed that there was at least as much chaos as conspiracy. But he did have a habit of getting other people into trouble. I remember once borrowing his car to visit my grandmother in hospital. It was a monster of a car, a Ford Granada estate with a spare fuel tank in the back adaptated to take Czech petrol. As it had made so many smuggling trips to the Czech republic I assumed it would be able to make it to Bath and back, but it didn't look good when I had a blow out in the fast-lane of the M4. On the way back, the gearbox started to disintegrate and the car would only drive at speed in a high gear. I was eventually stopped by the police doing 60 miles per hour through Hackney's main shopping street. It turned out that the car, which was registered under Jan's English pseudonym, was not insured for anyone else to drive. Luckily, I soon left for another job in France before anybody caught up with me. When I spoke to Jan Kavan last week he said he still thought fondly of his years in London and the cramped offices of the Esat European Reporter. 'In my heart Britain is my second country. Most of my closest friends are still in Britain. My British friends helped me for 20 years, travelling as couriers, helping to carry books. My only regret is that I didn't succeed in convincing President Havel to officially thank my British friends for what they did.' I last saw Jan Kavan in Paris in the early 1990s and he apologised for lending me his dodgy motor. He was recovering from a heart attack and looked relieved to be out of the political fray. He leapt back in shortly afterwards and hasn't looked back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
