The club were after all top of the pile for eight consecutive years until being deposed by Real Madrid 12 months ago. Yet your average fan is unlikely to give a tinker's cuss about who owns the most pennies so long as the wins keep coming and this latest three points had a tremendous air of inevitability about it. Charlton came to Old Trafford with the best away record of the sides in the bottom three, which sounded vaguely encouraging until you considered the abysmal form of the other two. Away defeat number 11 from 14 attempts came about thanks to a goal in each half from Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher. But this was a strangely off-colour performance by United. On another day, Charlton could even have come away from the north-west with something. The fact that arguably the biggest cheer of the afternoon welcomed the announcement of Liverpool's demise at Newcastle says it all. Sir Alex Ferguson's assertion in the match programme that 'I don't think you can say any one match is harder than the other' was put to the test during the opening exchanges as United set about testing Scott Carson's goal at will. In the sixth minute Park powered into the visitors' penalty area and fired in a right-foot drive that the Charlton goalkeeper did well to push over the bar. From the resulting corner Ryan Giggs turned Ben Thatcher before delivering a right-foot cross that Louis Saha met smartly, Carson again blocking low to his left. A United goal seemed imminent, so it came as something of a surprise even to Charlton's fans when the visitors proceeded to create two decent chances of their own. First Marcus Bent played in Dennis Rommedahl, who should have done better than find the side netting with a shot from 15 yards. Two minutes later Osei Sankofa delivered a hanging cross from the left that was met by Darren Ambrose. This time it was Tomasz Kuszczak's turn to excel in goal, diving full length to his left to concede a corner. It was, however, too good to last. In the 24th minute Saha found just enough space on the left flank to put in a cross, the ball taking a massive deflection off Sankofa before falling to Park, whose header from five yards out gave Carson no chance. Now normal service was resumed as United, bereft of the cold-ridden Cristiano Ronaldo, took control of the remainder of the first half. Wayne Rooney, absent from England duty here in midweek, went close to scoring a beauty even by his recent standards in collecting a chipped pass from Giggs, wrong-footing Souleymane Diawara and stabbing a right-foot shot just wide of Carson's right post. With large sections of Old Trafford making for their prawn sandwiches, Saha found the side netting from close range, admittedly when faced by a tight angle, after Gary Neville's cross fell at his feet via a rebound off Madjid Bougherra. Charlton strung together enough passes during the opening exchanges of the second period to get one or two of the natives restless, especially with news having come in of Chelsea's half-time advantage over Middlesbrough. But for all their endeavour, Alan Pardew's side struggled to get sight of goal, let alone carve out the odd opportunity. At the other end United also appeared lethargic, one well-off-target Giggs effort all they had to show in attack since retaking the field. By the 62nd minute Ferguson had clearly seen the need for a change. Giggs came off to be replaced by Henrik Larsson, yet still United seemed strangely subdued. Sensing perhaps the unexpected opportunity of a point, Pardew made a double substitution in the 73rd minute by replacing Matt Holland and Darren Ambrose with Bryan Hughes and Kevin Lisbie respectively. The shake-up so nearly reaped instant dividends, Marcus Bent flicking Rommedahl's free-kick within a couple of inches of Kuszczak's left post. Yet as in the first half, there was a sting in the tail for the visitors. With eight minutes remaining and Old Trafford growing decidedly edgy, Rooney suddenly found himself in space with only Carson to beat. His first shot cannoned back off the goalkeeper's legs. His second screwed horribly wide, but fortunately arced across the goalmouth, allowing Darren Fletcher to fling himself full-length and double United's lead. The message to Pardew and his side was clear - take your chances, or face the consequences. Charlton did, however, win on one level, their supporters remaining buoyant throughout and winning the best chant of the day competition with their 'We'll race you back to London' jibes at the United masses. With matches against West Ham, Watford, Newcastle and Wigan all to come in succession, they showed enough here to suggest relegation may not be the formality many had assumed. Man of the match: Dennis Rommedahl With United's stars strangely off colour and Cristiano Ronaldo missing, it was left to one or two of Charlton's unsung number to catch the eye. Rommedahl gets the vote for an energetic performance on the right side of mid\ufb01eld , even if he should have opened the scoring after nine minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
