The endorsement from Springsteen, revered far beyond the rust belt for songs such as Born in the USA, was a coup for Obama who has been struggling to end a damaging controversy ahead of Pennsylvania's primary next Tuesday. The nod from The Boss - as Springsteen is known to his fans - could prove especially important to Obama's support among white working-class males. The Democratic frontrunner was also endorsed by a Pittsburgh newspaper. In a posting on his website, Springsteen called the row a distraction from more important issues. \"Like most of you, I've been following the campaign and I have now seen and heard enough to know where I stand. Senator Obama, in my view, is head and shoulders above the rest.\" The posting added: \"He speaks to the America I've envisioned in my music for the past 35 years.\" The endorsement could help Obama get back to narrowing the gap with Clinton in Pennsylvania - a trend that was disrupted by a furore over his remarks at a San Francisco fundraiser. In his comments to California supporters, Obama had attributed the economic frustrations of smalltown life to his performance in rural areas. \"It's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them,\" he said. Clinton pounced on Obama's comments. She aired a television ad with Pennsylvania voters accusing Obama of being out of touch. After news broke of the Springsteen endorsement she moved to shore up her working-class credentials with an endorsement from a building trades union. Obama has hit back with two new television ads. One opens with footage of a crowd in Pittsburgh jeering Clinton when she tries to capitalise on the controversy. \"The same old Washington politics won't lower the price of gas or help our struggling economy,\" the ad says. But Obama's decision to keep the row alive appears to have hurt his chances. Preliminary polls show that his recent gains against Clinton have stalled. That could leave Clinton with the big win in Pennsylvania that she hopes will turn around her campaign. However, even if Clinton takes Pennsylvania, it could prove an empty victory. Washington Post-ABC News opinion polls yesterday showed her overall support continues to crumble. Some 51% of Democrats would prefer to see Obama as the party's nominee against 41% for Clinton. Democrats now consider Obama to be more electable than her by a 2:1 margin. Her unfavourable ratings have also risen - up to 54% among Democrats and nearly 60% among independents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
