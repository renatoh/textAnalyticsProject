However, the Manchester United manager refused to dwell on Ben\u00edtez's comments, preferring instead to comment on his own team's victory over Chelsea. \"We've got all the main teams at home and we really need to win these games. January is a big test for us,\" he said. Ferguson expressed his disappointment that Cristiano Ronaldo's goal from a quick Wayne Rooney corner was disallowed, saying it was a move they had practised at training, and he could see nothing wrong with it. Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari said the loss had done \"big damage\" to his team, adding that they need to go back to the drawing board. Man of the match Ryan Giggs said his team's three-goal thrashing of their London rivals has given them a huge confidence boost ahead of forthcoming fixtures against Wigan and Bolton Wanderers. \"First and foremost we wanted to win the game. It has set us up for a big week,\" said the 36-year-old. \"I'm not bothered about Chelsea - what it does to them. What it does to us is give us confidence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
