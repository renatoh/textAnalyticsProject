But he had to hold his nerve over the closing holes, sinking three missable par putts at the 15th, 16th and 17th to ensure his earlier good work didn't go to waste. Montgomerie, who has an awful record in this championship, made a spirited start in his latest quest to shake off the tag of \"best player never to win a major\". The big Scot began birdie-birdie to move quickly to two under, and despite dropping a shot at the par-3 5th, regrouped to surge back up the leader board. Despite overclubbing his approach into the par-5 6th, Monty chipped in from the apron for an eagle. He followed that up with a magnificent par save from penal greenside rough at the difficult 7th, and calmly sunk birdie putts at the 8th, 9th and 10th - the last a superb 30ft effort - to move into a commanding lead at six under. But Monty missed simple birdie opportunities at 12 and 13 - and it soon looked like he would pay for his profligacy. Having dropped his second shot of the day at the 14th, brazenly sending an easy six-foot putt sailing past the hole, Montgomerie suddenly looked unsettled. His driving became increasingly wayward, and over the closing holes he was repeatedly forced to conjure escapes from the rough and sink long par-saving putts. But save them he did - and he was rewarded for his gritty display when his 15-foot birdie putt at the last dropped. Monty went into the clubhouse on six under, three shots clear of Brad Faxon. The American will be sitting in the clubhouse wondering why he could only card a 68 after making five birdies and an eagle. But the American dropped several scrappy strokes, the most disheartening of which came at the 18th. Faxon is joined in second place by Jeff Maggert, who has become only the fifth player in Open history to make an albatross. He holed his second shot to the 494-yard par-5 6th to move to four under par - but after such a feat, it was all too predictable that he took six on the next hole, the par-5 7th. Amazingly, Maggert - who remains at three under after 8 - is also one of only three players to make an albatross in the Masters. KEY PLAYERS Tiger Woods: Level 18 The defending champion and pre-tournament favourite had, by his standards, a poor, poor day. He had picked up at Lytham where he left off at St Andrews, clipping an iron to 15ft on the 206yd par 3 1st and rolling in a birdie putt. But after parring the next two holes, Woods did something he failed to do at any of the 72 holes at St Andrews last year; he found a bunker and did well to take a bogey five. That set the tone for the rest of Tiger's round. He regularly traded birdies for bogeys and finished the round with a level-par 71. Darren Clarke: -1 18 The Ulsterman recovered from a double-bogey at the 1st to keep himself in contention. Clarke's opening tee-shot plugged under the lip of the 206-yard par-3 hole's greenside bunker, and he took two to get out. But Clarke dug in, dropping only one more shot all round, and earned himself a place near the top of the leader board - and a cigar, no doubt - with birdies at 4, 10, 17 and 18. Nick Faldo: +2 13 It was just like the old days for the three-time Open champion for a while, as he went off like a train. Three birdies in a row at the 5th, 6th and hellish 7th took Faldo to joint second place on three under. But sadly the wheels came clanking off spectacularly; the English legend dropped six shots over the next five holes to fall well off the pace. Justin Rose: -2 18 A spectacular eagle at the difficult 7th and a birdie at the 13th made for a superb opening round from the young man who made his name as an amateur in the 1998 Open, tying fourth. The only blemish on his card today was a five on the par-4 15th - which, let's be fair, is the hardest hole on the course. Jose Maria Olazabal: -2 18 It wasn't his usual style, but the usually spectacular Spaniard quietly sidled up to four-under par after 11 with some steady par-birdie-par golf. Sadly, he couldn't keep it up, and dropped shots at the 12th and 15th to move just as quietly back to two under. Fred Couples: Level 18 The American has put in an early bid for this year's Nakajima award for bunker madness. Standing at three under after 13, Couples' second shot plugged in the lip of a greenside bunker: his first escape attempt stayed plugged; his second, played backwards, stayed in the trap; his third hit the lip and rolled back into the bunker; but his fourth attempt to escape was successful - he splashed the ball to within inches of the hole. Back to level par, then. Lee Westwood: +2 14 Everyone's favourite chubby sportsman sprang out of the traps; a birdie at the 437-yard 2nd set the Englishman off on the right track. But dropped shots at 5th, 12th and 14th have bounced Lee back to earth. Ernie Els: Level 18 A strong recovery on the final holes earned the genial South African a level-par 71. The man who disproves the lyrics of that Spitting Image song birdied 15 and 18, playing a shot-of-the-day on the last - his 8-iron stopped teetering on the lip - to stay in the hunt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
