After twin failures in the Heineken Cup and the administrative hitch that saw them thrown out of the Powergen Cup they needed a solid win to cement second position in the league - realistically the only target they have left. It was never in doubt once Johnny O'Connor opened the scoring in the seventh minute but Gloucester nonetheless had grounds to be upset at the margin of victory after two sin-binnings had left them playing a man short for three minutes longer than necessary. The confusion came early in the second half when first Henry Paul and then Christo Bezuidenhout were shown yellow cards. Gloucester argued later that Paul's dismissal was harsh but they were more upset by their inability to get back to full strength with Jake Boer, who had been swapped for the banished prop, standing on the touchline waiting to catch the referee Roy Maybank's eye. During both sin-binnings Gloucester had managed to stop Wasps adding to their 26-15 lead and believed there was an opportunity for Boer to return before Simon Shaw finally barged his way over in the corner for the European champions' third and final try. \"There was a break in the game but they took a fast penalty and [Boer] didn't get the invitation to return,\" said Dean Ryan, the Gloucester coach. \"We'll have to look into it. It is disappointing but I'm sure they will find a law to hide behind when we query that tomorrow.\" Despite the sense of injustice, the real cause of Gloucester's difficulties continues to be the absence of key players. Against moderate opposition spirit and work-rate are often enough. Against the reigning Heineken and Zurich champions honest endeavour alone will not do. The pack was under pressure from the fifth minute when they were shoved backwards at the start of the move that led to O'Connor's try. Andy Hazell tried to clear up the mess but was penalised. Josh Lewsey got on the end of the tapped penalty, only to spill the ball with the line wide open. However, Maybank had spotted another infringement, Wasps drove the penalty and the Irish international was at the bottom of the pile of black shirts which crossed the Gloucester line. Twenty-three minutes later O'Connor rescued a poor pass from Matt Dawson before sending Lewsey over in the right corner. Paul chipped away with four penalties to keep the half-time lead to eight points but then Gloucester lost their fly-half Brad Davies and Maybank decided he had seen enough of infringing at the breakdown. Paul went for killing the ball, even though he appeared to have been the man tackled, and then Bezuidenhout joined him for attempting to stop a tapped penalty. That Wasps failed to take advantage of superior numbers was jointly down to their own inability to hang on to the ball and Gloucester's hyperactive defence. \"They just tackled marvellously,\" said Nigel Melville, the Gloucester director of rugby. \"They could have folded. When you think the ref is against you it doesn't help.\" Gloucester even managed to score the final try of the game, James Forrester crossing the line with three minutes to go. But a more realistic assessment came from Warren Gatland, Melville's opposite number. \"Until then I didn't think they were going to score if they played until next Christmas,\" said the Wasps' director of rugby. \"I don't believe they played any rugby. We dominated them.\" Wasps: Van Gisbergen; Lewsey, Richards, Abbott (Hoadley, 74), Voyce; King (Brooks, 74), Dawson (Biljon, 74); Dowd, Gotting (Barrett, 66), Green (McKenzie, 74), Shaw (Hart, 79), Birkett, Worsley, O'Connor, Dallaglio (capt).
