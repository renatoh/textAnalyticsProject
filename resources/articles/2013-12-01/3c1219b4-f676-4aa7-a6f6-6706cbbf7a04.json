Gerrard is out until January with a hamstring injury suffered against West Ham United and, with vice-captain Daniel Agger uncertain of a recall, the in-form Su\u00e1rez is in contention to lead Liverpool for the first time in his career. Glen Johnson took the armband when Gerrard was withdrawn last weekend and Agger will resume the captaincy should he displace Mamadou Sakho in central defence. That is not guaranteed, however, and Rodgers has refused to rule out making Su\u00e1rez captain just four months after he agitated for a move from Anfield. \"Daniel Agger is fit,\" the Liverpool manager said. \"He didn't train at the start of the week because he was ill, but he has been training now and he's available for selection. We shall see who will be captain.\" Asked if Su\u00e1rez could take the captaincy, Rodgers added: \"Would Luis be ready? 100%, absolutely. We will have to wait and see what my decision is at White Hart Lane. You'll see then.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
