He's joined in the pod by Guardian Unlimited's editor-in-chief Emily Bell and MediaGuardian columnist Kim Fletcher. The panellists discuss how newspapers and their websites are continuing to merge and evolve following this week's announcement by the Guardian that it will be publishing international and business news on a \"web-first\" basis; and the Telegraph's decision to do the exact opposite. Guardian Unlimited's Julia Day explains why Channel 4 has launched its radio output on the web in anticipation of a full multiplex licence. And with relations between the media and Britain's Muslim communities as strained as ever, the British Council has produced a pamphlet on how this can be addressed. Its editor Essan Massood tells Matt Wells how the project came about. The mischievous Gareth McLean is back for a news roundup which includes the BBC's new definition of the word \"gay\" and how Big Brother can compete with the World Cup over the next four weeks.
