Wanyama signed for a bargain \u00a311m from Southampton last summer and has established himself as the midfield shield in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s formation, whether the manager plays with a back four or a back three. His partnership with Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who is considered within the club to be the team\u2019s undisputed star, has provided balance and a platform for the creative talents further ahead, such as Eriksen, who has the joint-most assists in the Premier League, together with Gylfi Sigurdsson. \u201cVictor has given us a bit of stability,\u201d Eriksen says. \u201cIt is not easy to get past him. As a player, it makes me free to do my thing and go forward and I know there is someone there to cover me if I lose the ball. \u201cI think the team has a pretty good balance. When we don\u2019t have the ball, we know where we need to be and how to help each other out. We have been doing that very well. If somebody is in trouble, you help them. Whether it is at left-back, right-back or centre midfield.\u201d Eriksen, who covers more ground than any other Tottenham player, according to Opta, says the team have matured since last season, when they imploded in the final four matches, failing to finish above Arsenal as a result. Like everybody else at the club, he knows a trophy would be the most tangible sign of progress. \u201cEverybody has the feeling we want to win something and we know the FA Cup is a true route to a trophy,\u201d Eriksen says. \u201cWe have shown everyone we are capable of beating the best and being part of the best group. We have played together for a few years now and we know how we need to play. We are more mature.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
