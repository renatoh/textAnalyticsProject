After the suspension, shares in Alibaba, which owns part of Ant, fell more than 8%, shaving $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) off Ma\u2019s net worth. \u201cWealth is an ant in front of power,\u201d internet users quipped, while others posted the phrase heralding the end of Ma\u2019s era, taken from the headline of a previously published editorial by the state-run People\u2019s Daily disparaging the worship of celebrity businessmen like Ma. Analysts say the unusual and dramatic halt of the initial public offering (IPO) less than 48 hours before it was to begin trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong underlines the dominance of the Chinese Communist party over the private sector \u2013 and the danger of criticising those in charge. \u201cThe party has once again reminded all private entrepreneurs that no matter how rich and successful you are it can pull the rug out from under your feet at any time,\u201d wrote Bill Bishop, the author of the China-focused newsletter Sinocism. Regulators cited \u201cchanges to the financial technology regulatory environment and other major issues\u201d for the halt. While Beijing on Monday issued draft rules on micro-lending that would affect a key part of Ant\u2019s business, analysts say the last-minute suspension is more likely to do with remarks Ma gave on 24 October at a summit in Shanghai. In a characteristically blunt speech, Ma directly criticised local regulators and the state-dominated banking sector. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport,\u201d Ma said. \u201cWe cannot regulate the future with yesterday\u2019s means.\u201d Ma was speaking alongside top officials such as Wang Qishan, former security tsar and Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s right-hand man, Yi Gang, the governor of China\u2019s central bank, and Zou Jiayi, vice minister at the ministry of finance. The entrepreneur\u2019s comments came just after a speech by Wang warning that there should be a balance between financial innovation and regulation. \u201cSafety always comes first,\u201d Wang said. Yet it was Ma\u2019s comments that went viral on Chinese social media and were seen as a direct attack on officials. Less than two weeks later, Ma, along with two other executives, was summoned to meet financial regulators, and the next day the IPO was halted. In a statement on social media, Ant said it would \u201covercome the challenges\u201d and \u201cembrace regulation\u201d. The Chinese state media and commentators have piled on criticism of Ma, justifying the move. The People\u2019s Daily published an article on Wednesday claiming \u201cfinancial security is an important part of national security\u201d and calling for financial institutions to \u201cstrengthen the Party\u2019s leadership\u201d. The episode also underlines official unease over the rise of online finance, dominated by companies such as Ant and Tencent whose digital payments platforms allow customers to make all their purchases with mobile money as well as invest and borrow. In an article late on Tuesday, the state-run Economic Daily said suspending Ant Group\u2019s listing was to \u201cbetter protect the rights and interests of financial consumers\u201d. Without naming the company, which rebranded itself from Ant Financial to Ant Technology earlier this year, the paper said some companies had changed their name to avoid scrutiny as a financial institution. Observers say that by taking Ma down a peg, China\u2019s top officials are also reminding the country\u2019s wealthy who is in charge. \u201cMany might point to such regulator intervention and say: \u2018Look, it also affects the tycoons.\u2019 In fact, in a way it applies more to PRC tycoons as money means power, and this would signal that it can be taken away if you don\u2019t play ball,\u201d said Benjamin Qiu, a Hong Kong-based partner at an international law firm. That message was circulated on Chinese social media where some posted a scene from a 2017 kung-fu film starring Ma where his character profusely apologises to a group of police. Others turned the tagline for Ant into a Chinese idiom to mean \u201cJack Ma has now been tamed.\u201d Still, others questioned whether in the long term China\u2019s reputation as open for business may be hurt. Chinese leaders have recently hammered out the country\u2019s next five-year plan, which promises to support the Covid-hit economy with innovation in the tech sector and by boosting domestic demand. \u201cIt is 2020. If the government intervenes too much, more good companies will flee,\u201d one commentator wrote on Weibo. Another said: \u201cThere is never a good ending for big Chinese businessmen.\u201d \u2022 Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
