When news broke of Silver Sun singer James Broad\u2019s death from bowel cancer, the internet was duly awash with acclaim for the songwriter\u2019s innate grasp of melody. You dearly hope Broad \u2013 who was in his late 40s \u2013 knew just how appreciated his talent was in life, too. Sadly, that is unlikely. Though his band were familiar on the Britpop scene \u2013 the band\u2019s self-titled 1997 debut and helium-throated breakout single Lava are widely regarded as genre classics \u2013 what became apparent during the collective grieving of Friday night was that few were aware of Silver Sun\u2019s creative output after being dropped by Polydor in 1999. The band\u2019s excellent sixth album, Switzerland, was released in April. Britpop was Silver Sun\u2019s blessing and curse. It brought the band to prominence during an era when chequebooks were open and advances were big, but the band, with their crunchy barre chords, big choruses and complex multi-layered harmonies, were much more suited to the American powerpop or pop-punk scenes than they were the larks of Camden in the 90s. Silver Sun were more Big Star than Blur, more Green Day than Gene, much more akin to the great Cheap Trick than Cast. While the quality of Broad\u2019s songwriting crossed three decades, it was the single Lava that remained their signature song. Released twice (it failed to hit to the Top 40 in 1996, then crept in at No 35 a year later), it\u2019s a wholly unique composition: whippet fast, fizzy, with a lyric sheet that confounds even now (\u201cBull\u2019s blood for baby Jesus, for lava, for lava\u201d). The song, and its parent album \u2013 produced by a young Nigel Godrich and containing similarly hook-heavy singles Last Day, Golden Skin and Julia \u2013 are key documents of an era when indie was the pop of its time. It\u2019s also cruel, for a band led by a songwriter of Broad\u2019s ability, that their biggest hit wasn\u2019t a composition of their own. Released in 1998, their crunchy cover of Too Much, Too Little, Too Late \u2013 by the Australian songwriter John Vallins and a 1978 US No 1 for Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams \u2013 unlocked the doors to TFI Friday and Saturday-morning kids\u2019 TV. \u201cNot really my favourite thing,\u201d said Broad when I interviewed him just a week ago. \u201cWe did it for fun as a B-side, and then some fuckwit said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do a covers EP?\u2019\u201d A further Top 30 single, I\u2019ll See You Around, followed, but second album Neo Wave reached only No 74, and they were dismissed from their major-label home. I wasn\u2019t aware that Broad had cancer when I contacted him for a project where I interview the unsung indie heroes of my teenage years. In years gone by I had seen him around \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 frequenting supermarkets and pubs in east London, without ever having the steel to approach him; I\u2019d coveted the imported bicycles and T-shirts he sold as part of his online business, Old Skool Hooligans. And I\u2019d kept abreast of Silver Sun\u2019s output, almost becoming blase about their consistent quality even as their lineup concertina\u2019d. Broad plays all the instruments on Disappear Here (2005) but the group reconvened for Dad\u2019s Weird Dream a year later, before dropping back to its sole constant on the eclectic A Lick &amp; A Promise (2013). When the original lineup of Richard Buckton (bass), Paul Smith (guitar) and Richard Sayce (drums) joined Broad to support a newly reunited Sleeper at the Shepherd Bush Empire in late 2017, it felt as if they hadn\u2019t missed a beat; the future felt open. So it was a shock when he told me of his terminal illness. \u201cI probably have about four years max left \u2013 unless someone comes up with something pretty impressive soon to fix me up,\u201d he said. \u201cI am learning to live with that fact. It\u2019s not easy. I don\u2019t really worry about myself as such. It\u2019s hard to worry about something you really don\u2019t have any control over. I worry more about my wife, daughter and my mum who all kind of rely on me for various stuff. I\u2019m doing all I can to try and sort all my shit out so they don\u2019t have too much crap to do when I\u2019m not around. \u201cSorry to end this chat on a down note,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not walking around in a gloom all the time. I try and stay pretty positive. I haven\u2019t done much recording as singing loud is quite hard, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get around to some new stuff soon.\u201d I am at least grateful that in the days prior to his death he received a volume of emails from me informing him he was a genius. If Broad has a legacy \u2013 beyond the volume of brilliant songs to bear his name \u2013 it should be that we tell creators that their art does so much for us, when they\u2019re here to hear us say it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
