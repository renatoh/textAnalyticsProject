Manchester City now need just five wins from their remaining 10 games to secure a third Premier League title in seven years. If everything goes as serenely as it has done for most of the season, they could sew it up at Tottenham Hotspur on the night of Saturday 14 April. Circle it in your diary. It would be the coronation of a superbly slick and worthy champion team and the latest layer to Pep Guardiola\u2019s managerial legend. As for Arsenal, a more macabre countdown is in train. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has pledged to fight into next season \u2013 the last on his managerial contract \u2013 but nobody believes he can stay beyond the summer. On this evidence, his players are the principal naysayers. After the 3-0 humbling at City\u2019s hands in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final, they needed a performance to restore a measure of pride. Instead they got another one of those 90 minutes when their fragility was exposed in glaring fashion. Arsenal have not lost this heavily at home to City since they dropped the Woolwich from their name, but there was nothing surprising about the result. Their self-belief has come to feel non-existent and the manner in which they were picked off by City in the first half reflected the sense of drift. Leroy San\u00e9 made the difference. The City winger helped set up goals for Bernardo Silva and David Silva before he scored the third himself and Arsenal were left to consider a 30-point chasm that has opened up between themselves and their opponents. It was an occasion when the home support appeared to vote with their feet. The Emirates was half-empty and at kick-off time there was the feel of an early round cup replay. The biting cold was a factor but \u2013 on paper, at least \u2013 this was one of the showpiece fixtures of the season. The low attendance laid bare the supporter disenchantment. Wenger\u2019s team had actually started well. With Aaron Ramsey prominent, they hustled and probed. Ramsey cut back a cross that hit Vincent Kompany and forced Ederson into a smart save while Henrikh Mkhitaryan also worked the City goalkeeper. But it took only one flicker from City to see them in front and, very quickly, Arsenal\u2019s confidence disintegrated. \u201cYou go up by the stairs, you go down by the lift,\u201d Wenger said of the difficulty in building belief and the ease with which it can slide. Arsenal\u2019s movement and spontaneity abandoned them, but not nearly as noticeably as their resolve at the back. It felt as though City would score with every forward thrust before the interval. San\u00e9 was the catalyst. Showing his balance, control and acceleration, he left three Arsenal players for dead before working it wide right for Bernardo Silva. Sead Kolasinac decided to show the winger inside, on to his favoured left foot, and the finish was curled beautifully into the far corner. Arsenal tried to look forwards and they had half-chances in the first half. But they were cut to shreds on the counterattack and, if it was easy to wince at the defending, it was also pertinent to scrutinise the lack of defensive midfield cover. Arsenal were grotesquely open. That said, City\u2019s cohesion and ruthlessness was really something. San\u00e9 was the architect of the second goal, dropping his shoulder to destroy Shkodran Mustafi before squaring for Sergio Ag\u00fcero. He touched through for David Silva, who fired high inside Petr Cech\u2019s near post. City\u2019s third came with indecent haste. Ag\u00fcero spun clear and they worked the ball with precision via Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker to San\u00e9, who had got in on H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn\u2019s blindside. He finished almost apologetically. Ag\u00fcero ought to have added a fourth before the interval, only to be denied by Cech, and there were the inevitable boos from the home crowd at half-time. A small section of the Arsenal support chanted that their players were not fit to wear the shirt. Arsenal even threw in a penalty miss early in the second-half \u2013 Ederson springing to his left to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, after Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi had fouled Mkhitaryan \u2013 and it would have been worse for them had Cech not saved from Ag\u00fcero on 78 minutes. The stadium was practically empty of Arsenal fans at full-time but those who did stay jeered the players as they left the field. It felt like the end for Wenger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
