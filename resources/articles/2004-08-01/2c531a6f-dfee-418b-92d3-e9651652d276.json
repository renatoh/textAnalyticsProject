The first historical accounts of this archetypal weapon of mass destruction date to the Second Punic War, 218-202 BC. Defending the city of Syracuse against a Roman assault, the Greek sage Archimedes is said to have used a series of hexagonal mirrors (or bronze shields) to focus sunlight into a searing beam that set the Romans' ships alight. The incident was successfully reconstructed in 1973 by Dr Ioannis Sakkas, who used 50 bronze-coated mirrors. When it comes to 20th century death rays, two names feature prominently: the Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla and an Englishman, Harry Grindell Matthews. \"It will be possible to destroy anything approaching within 200 miles. My invention will provide a wall of power, \"the 81-year-old Tesla told Liberty magazine in 1937. He spoke of several directional lightning and beam weapons in his lifetime, none of which were demonstrated. In his final years he claimed to have built \"teleforce\", a highly charged particle wall that would surround nations and destroy anything that approached it. Tesla's claim can probably be taken with a pinch of salt, though plans for it may have been among those acquired by US Intelligence after his death. In 1921, Harry Grindell Matthews produced one of the first talking films, of Shackleton's speech before setting off for Antarctica, but he remains best known for his \"death ray\". In 1923 he astounded journalists by stopping a motorcycle engine at 50ft using a projected beam. The finished version, he claimed, would knock aeroplanes out of the sky. But Matthews refused to explain how the device worked, and a military demonstration only caused a light bulb to glow and a small motor to stop. When the British government refused to fund his project, Matthews threatened to take it to the French, and the Americans. Neither produced working death rays in the second world war. A 1924 Path\u00bf film features Matthews himself operating an impressive, but unfortunately entirely fictional, ray device.This, we can assume, was as close as he got to the real thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
