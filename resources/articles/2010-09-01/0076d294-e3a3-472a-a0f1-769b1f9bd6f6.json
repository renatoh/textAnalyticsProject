The reaction to the terrorist threat is frequently worse than the threat itself on both sides of the Atlantic. Tom Kelly West Springfield, Massachusetts, USA \u2022\u2008I read with interest that the Queen gave the pope a gift of a set of drawings by the 16th-century painter Hans Holbein the Younger (Report, 17 September).

I wore a two-piece suit made of salami to the Slade post-graduate private view in 1979 (and have the photos to prove it). Bob Connolly London \u2022\u2008Re the letter from Tony Latham (14 September): our two drums on a Lufthansa flight in 2004 were upgraded to seats in business class. My husband and I were not.
