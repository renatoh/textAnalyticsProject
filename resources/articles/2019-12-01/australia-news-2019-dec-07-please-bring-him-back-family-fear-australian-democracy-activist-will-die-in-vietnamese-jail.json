Human rights advocates, lawyers and Chau Van Kham\u2019s family say the charges against him are baseless and politically motivated, his single-day multiple-defendant trial was grossly unfair, and his failing health means he may not survive. On the walls of the Chau family home in suburban Sydney hang pictures of an absent man. Chau\u2019s wife has not seen her husband, not heard his voice, since he was arrested in January. \u201cPlease ... bring him back, bring him back to me,\u201d Quynh Trang Truong says haltingly, through tears. \u201cI just want him home. Before he gets too old, before he is too unwell, I am worried he will be too sick.\u201d Quynh has written to Scott Morrison, \u201cfilled with both faint hopes and great despair, to seek your valuable help \u2026 so my husband can be released and reunited with his family in Australia\u201d. \u201cHe is a hard-working citizen, and he deserves the Australian government\u2019s support in this painful circumstance.\u201d Qunyh said in the letter her husband was innocent of the charges of terrorism. \u201cI believe you have already known very clearly this is an absolutely false and groundless allegation against my elderly husband.\u201d Chau\u2019s son Daniel tells Guardian Australia his father\u2019s serious health conditions have deteriorated badly in prison and his isolation has heightened his family\u2019s fears. \u201cTwelve years is pretty much a death sentence. Dad is suffering. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been able to speak directly to him since he was arrested on 15 January. We saw pictures of him at the trial, he looks pale, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s physically OK. Even though the guards say he\u2019s getting treatment, just his face at his trial, he doesn\u2019t look healthy to me.\u201d Quynh and Australian lawyer Dan Phuong Nguyen, who is acting pro bono for the family, travelled to Canberra this week for meetings with parliamentarians and representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Quynh says she was grateful for the official attention to her husband\u2019s case, and hopeful Australian government entreaties might yield a breakthrough. She says her family would accept an immediate deportation order and a commitment Chau would never return to Vietnam, in exchange for his liberty. In prison in Ho Chi Minh City, Chau has only been allowed to see one relative, his sister \u2013 who lives in Vietnam \u2013 on two occasions since being arrested. A niece who flew to Vietnam for the trial was refused entry to see him in prison and denied access to the courtroom where he was tried and sentenced at his first appearance in a single-day judge-only trial alongside five other defendants. Chau, a naturalised Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the army of the Republic of Vietnam before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years, before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. In Sydney, he worked as a baker for decades, rising before dawn to be at work at a modest suburban bakery. In his retirement he took to growing long rows of dragon fruit in his backyard for neighbours and local markets, and he turned to democratic activism. He became prominent in the Australian wing of Viet Tan, a political organisation dedicated to the democratisation of Vietnam, and a vocal campaigner for increased transparency and civil rights. In the 1980s, Viet Tan advocated toppling Vietnam\u2019s communist government through popular uprising, but in recent years it has explicitly rejected the use of violence, stating the organisation is \u201cconvinced that nonviolent means are most effective \u2026 to contribute to Vietnam\u2019s modernisation and reform\u201d. Chau only joined Viet Tan in 2010, but became a key organiser of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democratisation in Vietnam. He sought to return to Vietnam in January 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa by the Vietnamese government. He chose to cross into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia, carrying false documents against his wife\u2019s urging. \u201cI told him \u2018don\u2019t go into Vietnam\u2019, but he still went, he wanted to see the country.\u201d Chau\u2019s son Daniel says his visit to Vietnam was a \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d. \u201cThe only rule he broke was he had the wrong documents. He had no ill intent to cause trouble or anything like that. He just wanted to see the situation on the ground.\u201d Chau met a fellow democracy activist who, it is believed, was under surveillance. Chau was later arrested, along with Vietnamese nationals Nguyen Van Vien and Tran Van Quyen, who were sentenced to 11 and 10 years respectively. Chau was initially charged with participating in activities aimed at overthrowing the government, but in July, this was downgraded slightly to \u201cterrorism to oppose the people\u2019s government\u201d. At their extremes, both charges carry the potential of execution under Vietnam\u2019s penal code, but long prison sentences (Chau\u2019s is considered heavy, but not extreme) are the most common punishment. Despite sweeping economic reforms and an increasing openness to social change, Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate political criticism both within and from outside Vietnam. Viet Tan is proscribed as a terrorist group by the Vietnamese government, but the United Nations describes it as \u201ca peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform\u201d. Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Chau was convicted of holding a senior position in the New South Wales chapter of Viet Tan, for \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d and for recruiting new members to the movement. \u201cThis is a very serious case of national security infringement led by Viet Tan\u2019s key people,\u201d prosecutors told the court. \u201cIt\u2019s all just a lie,\u201d Chau\u2019s son Daniel says of his conviction and sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s just another excuse to squash opposition to their rule, regardless of whether it\u2019s legitimate or not.\u201d In a letter to the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, urging the Australian government to more forcefully press Chau\u2019s rights, Human Rights Watch Australia director Elaine Pearson said there were severe flaws in Chau\u2019s trial and conviction. Having been arrested in January, Chau was not allowed to see a lawyer until October. All of his meetings with consular officials have been recorded on camera and undertaken in the presence of prison and other government officials, Pearson wrote. No evidence was presented in court documents, or during his trial, of any plans to engage in any violent, seditious or terrorist act. In addition to Chau, Nguyen and Tran, three further people were sentenced for manufacturing false documents. All six were tried and convicted in a single trial before a lone judge. \u201cThe trial lasted only four-and-a-half hours, suggesting the verdict was pre-determined,\u201d Pearson wrote. \u201cWith six defendants, the court would barely have enough time to carry out normal process including reading the names and charges, let alone listening to presentation of evidence and defence arguments in a fair and unbiased manner. All Vietnamese judges are required to be members of the Communist party of Vietnam.\u201d Chau\u2019s Vietnamese lawyer Nguyen Van Mieng says Chau professed his love for Vietnam during his trial and told the court he never had \u201cany intention to carry out terrorism activities in the country\u201d. \u201cThe prosecutors stuck to the idea that he\u2019s a member of Viet Tan to charge him with terrorism. The jail terms for political prisoners are getting longer and longer,\u201d he says. In a statement, Viet Tan condemned Chau\u2019s hearing as a \u201csham trial\u201d. \u201cViet Tan will continue to support human rights defenders on the ground. Chau Van Kham entered Vietnam to gain first-hand insight into the human rights situation in the country,\u201d the organisation\u2019s chairman, Do Hoang Diem, said in the statement. Chau has lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence, but he has not been allowed to see a lawyer to prepare. \u201cEven if Dad fills the forms out, goes through the procedure correctly, I worry they will just palm it off,\u201d Daniel Chau says. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way he will get a fair trial.\u201d The Australian government\u2019s ability to assist citizens arrested overseas is often limited, but the government has brought significant political pressure to bear on other countries, such as China over the continued detention of Yang Hengjun, North Korea over the now-released Alek Sigley, and Thailand over Hakeem al-Araibi, also now freed. Australia\u2019s public advocacy on Chau\u2019s behalf has been subdued in comparison. In Hanoi in August, prime minister Morrison was asked directly about Chau\u2019s case, and Australian government overtures on his behalf. \u201cAustralians need to abide by the laws of the countries which they visit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a leave pass from laws when they go into someone else\u2019s country and commit crimes \u2026 but we will always seek to support our citizens in these difficult circumstances.\u201d Chau\u2019s arrest comes at a delicate moment for Australian relations in south-east Asia. With Chinese relations enduring acute and prolonged strain, and with a growing sense of a diminishing US influence and capacity across the Asia Pacific, Australia is seeking to buttress its relationships with regional countries, in particular allies like Vietnam. Australia signed a strategic partnership with Vietnam in 2018, particularly focused on defence cooperation, and this year agreed to host annual leaders\u2019 meetings. Pearson has urged the government to put the rights of an Australian citizen above political concerns. \u201cAustralia should not tolerate Vietnam\u2019s systemic abuses of rights for the sake of prosperity and stability.\u201d Chau\u2019s wife only wants to hold her husband at home once more. \u201cIt\u2019s too long. Too much pain for me. I want to see him again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
