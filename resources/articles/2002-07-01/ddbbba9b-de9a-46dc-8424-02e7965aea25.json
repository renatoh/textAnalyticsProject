The joint committee of MPs and peers, headed by Labour peer and film maker Lord Puttnam, will on Wednesday recommend that the government scraps plans to allow newspaper groups, or television companies allied to them, to buy into Channel 5. The move would effectively end the chances of the Murdoch-chaired BSkyB buying Channel 5. The committee is also rec ommending that US companies should be barred from buying UK media firms unless the US opens its markets in return. The government's draft communications bill, published in May, placed no restrictions on foreign-owned firms, provoking accusations that British media would be flooded with cheap, low-quality US imports. But the Department of Culture, Media and Sport rejected the report's recommendations in advance of its formal publication, saying: \"The provisions in the communications bill were not tenatative proposals, they were decisions.\" The department said it would look at the committee's ideas and the evidence on which they are based, but added: \"The government still believes that British industry and the public will benefit enormously from the foreign investment that would flow from these recommendations.\" Under the committee's recommendations, US media giants like Disney, Viacom, AOL Time Warner, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, would be prevented from buying British television and radio assets. The committee will also call for greater powers and acountability for Ofcom, the new communications regulator, which will be responsible for overseeing the quality of programmes. The committee wants its two proposals to be observed for three years and then reviewed by Ofcom. A source close to the parliamentary committee said Mr Blair would face stiff opposition in the House of Lords if he failed to accept the report's recommendations. \"The Lords are adamant on these two points,\" the source said. \"The government may be able to whip the bill through [the Commons] but the Lords will simply bat it right back again.\" The government has no overall majority in the Lords. The bill is due to start its parliamentary passage in the autumn. Members of the committee include Lord Puttnam, former BBC chairman Lord Hussey, the former broadcasting standards committee chairman Lord Pilkington, ex-ITV boss Lord Crickhowell and former BBC governor Lady Cohen. \"We couldn't find any evidence of immediate positive benefits to British companies from opening up the domestic market without reciprocity from the US,\" the source said. Members also expressed concern about Sky being allowed to buy Channel 5 at a time when it is also making a joint bid with the BBC to take over the remains of ITV Digital. The committee's report will also suggest that the BBC's trading relationship with independent production compa nies should be monitored by Ofcom. The committee source said: \"There is a feeling the BBC has become too big for its boots and needs its wings clipped for the sake of the wider ecology for British broadcasting.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
