Despite the highly anticipated meeting between the US and Chinese presidents on Saturday, the first since trade talks broke down in May, few expect a substantive agreement to end almost a year of trade tensions and months of deteriorating ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies. \u201cI think at best we could see a superficial agreement to halt further escalation of the trade war and an agreement to resume negotiations,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a US-China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Ahead of the meeting, Trump has threatened to implement more tariffs on another round of Chinese goods, worth $300bn, including on everyday products used by US consumers like electronics. The standoff has rattled the world\u2019s financial markets amid nervousness about potential disruption of the international trade system and knock-on implications for global growth. Asian markets were down on Wednesday morning after US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell cast some doubt on expectations of a cut in interest rates. There have been signs the two sides want to restart talks. US and Chinese officials have spoken over the phone in the days leading up to the two-day summit, which begins on Friday in Japan, and US vice president Mike Pence delayed giving a critical speech on China. According to Japan\u2019s Asahi newspaper on Wednesday, the G20 leaders will call in a draft communique for the \u201cpromotion of free trade\u201d as a means to achieve strong global growth. The text also stressed the importance of creating a positive cycle where the benefits of solid growth are distributed broadly across economies, the Asahi said. But experts say it is unlikely that the two sides were willing to make significant concessions. \u201cWe should see this as a momentary pause but markets shouldn\u2019t expect there to be a deal,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either side will ever meet the other side\u2019s bottom line.\u201d Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo, said the markets were fully focused on the G20 but were not optimistic. \u201cMarket expectations for a meaningful breakthrough being achieved in U.S.-China trade talks are quite low, so any signs of an improvement could bode well for risk sentiment,\u201d he said. Senior US officials said this week that Trump\u2019s stance had not changed and that he was \u201cquite comfortable\u201d with the position of the administration at the moment, and with any outcome of the talks. Chinese state media have promised the country will \u201cfight to the end\u201d and have framed the trade war as an attempt by Washington to constrain China\u2019s development. Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday: \u201cWe should meet each other halfway \u2026 both sides need to compromise and make concessions, not just one side,\u201d he said. \u201cMutual respect means each side must respect the other\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d The official People\u2019s Daily said in an editorial this week: \u201cRetreating on any issue related to China\u2019s core interest means giving up the future of China\u2019s development.\u201d The trade talks come amid mass protests in Hong Kong over a controversial extradition bill, a topic Beijing has said will not be discussed at the summit. The meeting also takes place amid what some have called a digital cold war between the US and China. The US has placed Chinese technology companies including Huawei on a trade blacklist while China has threatened to release its own list of blacklisted US firms. \u201cThe Trump-Xi talks could open the path for renewed trade negotiations to defuse the US-China trade and technology wars that have been escalating in recent weeks,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. Observers say that even if a trade agreement or truce is reached, the era of broader US-China rivalry and tension over politics, security, human rights, and business as well as trade, is only just beginning. \u201cTrade negotiations are a very thin slice of what is now a comprehensive and enduring strategic competition that will most certainly get worse before it gets better,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, senior adviser and China practice lead at the Crumpton Group, an advisory group in Washington. Ominous prospects of Middle East conflict also loom over the summit, after Iran shot down a US drone following accusations by Washington that it had attacked two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. A White House official said Trump would meet at least eight world leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to win support for sanctions on Iran. Japans prime minister Shinzo Abe wants the G20 summit to focus on reforming the World Trade Organization, empowering female workers and reducing plastic rubbish in the ocean. As Trump prepared to leave for Japan, a White House official told Associated Press that the president\u2019s chief of protocol, Sean Lawler, was leaving the administration amid a probe of his management of staff. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
