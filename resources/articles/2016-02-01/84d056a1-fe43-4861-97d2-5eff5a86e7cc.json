While Manchester City\u2019s manager, Manuel Pellegrini, will play a weakened side on account of Wednesday\u2019s Champions League trip to Dynamo Kyiv, Hiddink says the FA Cup is a priority and will make \u201chardly any\u201d changes. The Dutchman clarified that he would not hesitate in using his young players if required but confirmed the likes of Traor\u00e9 and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who have featured only sporadically, are set to gain more experience in league matches towards the end of the season. \u201cPutting one of the youngsters in depends on the demands of the FA Cup, but I don\u2019t hesitate putting them in if needed,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cWe have games still to go in the Premier League where there might be more options. I don\u2019t make any guarantees to players but there might be more opportunities for them in the near future. Sometimes you cannot always stick to your principles but they will get some chances.\u201d Traor\u00e9 scored his first senior goal in the previous round against MK Dons and struck his first in the league last weekend in the rout of Newcastle. While the player had considered going on loan before deciding to bide his time at Stamford Bridge, Hiddink is glad he remained, saying the 20-year-old striker is \u201cimproving tremendously\u201d. Hiddink added: \u201cAlthough he\u2019s not playing, his character is very optimistic, He\u2019s always coming in with a smile, whether he\u2019s playing or not. When a player comes into the Premier League, saying \u2018I don\u2019t want to go on loan, I want to make my progress here\u2019, and when they get their first goal \u2013 and it was a beautiful goal, a typical striker\u2019s goal which I like very much \u2013 it was a tremendous joy for him. \u201cHe was desperate to stay. We were thinking about sending him on loan, yes or no. We talked about that but he would love to be with us for the rest of the season and he has made progress.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
