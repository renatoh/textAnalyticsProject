Those 15 include two since he joined on three-month loan from Milan. Both were lost, one last week at Charlton, when West failed to return from Nigerian World Cup duty. It was not quite fatted-calf time when he showed up on Friday but his manager Jim Smith sacrificed disciplinarian tendencies on the altar of discretion and wrapped his irritation in relief. He almost became philosophical. \"He's a strange guy,\" said the manager. \"He likes going on planes too much. He's from a different culture and we have to try and regulate. With Taribo you get a certain amount of baggage.\" That is air travel. What infuriated Smith was that West did not ring. Apparently there was a \"serious family illness\", which Smith accepted. It stood to reason: they have large families there and their health service is not much better than ours. But they have mobiles too. On Saturday's evidence the manager is rightly desperate to extend West's three-month loan to the end of the season. It is not just his defensive strength or his quick eye for the break. By results alone he has become totemic: different culture, different hair, different class where there is not much. As the Sunderland manager Peter Reid said: \"They were catching us on the break. It was a strange game. We looked like the home side.\" But Derby were also caught offside so often on the break that in three second-half minutes they had three men booked for dissent. With seven booked in all, they will suffer an FA fine. They deserved their win, though preserved it only by an elastic last-minute tip on to a post by Andy Oakes to deny John Oster. The 24-year-old keeper, who came to this debut via Bury, Winsford United and Hull for \u00a3450,000, once worked on a poultry farm. After action of battery dullness, it was a fine free-range save. When Don Hutchison should have beaten him, he chipped wide. But that was Sunderland's only real chance. At the other end Horacio Carbonari and Craig Burley both hit posts and Deon Burton and Lee Morris shot wide when clear. The goal, though, was almost by the way. Adam Murray played the ball through for what looked a likely goalkick but Stefano Eranio chased and crossed and Burley, getting more often forward with fuller fitness, swept in. For the second time in four days Sunderland had paid for not playing to the whistle. Detached and lacking focus? Mandelson's disease is catching in the north-east. Reid was unfazed. \"We had good possession but the final pass was not there,\" he said. He must be wary they do not throw away the good work that has put them in the running for a Champions League place. Last season defeat by Manchester United triggered a run of nine games without a win. A booking means Hutchison, like Alex Rae and Michael Gray, will miss the West Ham Cup game. As Derby had Eranio forward on the right of midfield as a halfway stage to forward propulsion, so Reid deployed Hutchison, perhaps to supplement his reduced spearhead. Niall Quinn is top banana by any measure in Sunderland. Daniele Dichio, who prefers kilos, is just dead weight. Reid needs a different tactic, if not alternative striker. There is no point in starting with 10 men. Meanwhile at Derby West is worth his weight in the gold of Premiership survival - 12 games to go, 22 points, easy. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
