The 70-year-old princess was told to stay in bed over Christmas and the New Year and is still awaiting test results. Margaret was seen by a doctor twice over the weekend. Buckingham Palace would not discuss the medical tests.\"She is continuing to rest at Sandringham, where she has nursing care available to her,\" a spokeswoman said. Margaret, the Queen's younger sister, was absent from the Royal Family's Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services at Sandringham and the Palace said she was \"feeling tired\". The nature of the medical tests is confidential, but doctors hope they will pinpoint the princess's illness. She has not been admitted to hospital and is expected to remain at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate, for the foreseeable future. The People newspaper claimed that the princess was missing from the royal festivities because she was depressed. The paper said it was so bad that she refused to leave Sandringham on Christmas Day to join the rest of her family at church. It was claimed that Margaret was spending up to two weeks at a time in bed in the \"depths of despair\" and was so depressed she had \"lost the will to live\". Margaret had lost her appetite and experienced violent mood swings, the paper said. The princess was last seen in public in November at a London Ballet gala evening. Margaret, who normally lives at Kensington Palace, suffered serious burns to her legs and feet in an accident while on holiday in the Caribbean during March 1999. The previous year, also on the island of Mustique, she suffered a stroke. Margaret is said to have given up smoking after a part of her lung was removed in 1985."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
