Happy Valley season one was a pure, focused thriller. As soon as one weak man (Steve Pemberton\u2019s sweaty accountant Kevin) had rashly plotted a kidnapping, we were off. Each horror flowed from the last, and no outlandish twist was required, apart from the convenience of the police sergeant finding that the man responsible for her shattered family life was also the villain she was after. But when Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) caught Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton), solving the case and saving her grandson, it was a neat double redemption. The end. Then Happy Valley got recommissioned. At first I thought, great! And then I thought, wait \u2013 what could possibly, plausibly happen? Happy Valley was at risk of joining the Life on Mars memorial museum of shows that couldn\u2019t sustain a second season but were too popular not to try. As of season two, episode two, we\u2019re on the edge. Four big storylines are vying for attention. But between them, they\u2019re generating too many pin-perfect scenes for the overall health of the show to be a concern. \u201cI have indeed got the kettle on, Winnie. Ta ta\u201d The main new strand starts before the titles, when Catherine brings home Ilinka, a nervous Croatian whose breathless arrival at the police station has led the cops to raid a house full of enslaved women. Catherine has Tasered a trafficker in the balls, bust the migrants out and arranged for Ilinka to stay with Winnie, an elderly neighbour who, handily, lives directly opposite and speaks Serbo-Croat. Catherine interrupts Daniel and Clare arguing after he called her an alcoholic in front of Ryan. This discussion, with its element of dry farce as everyone tiptoes around the topic despite their guest speaking no English, snugly fills the time it takes for Winnie to cross the yard \u2013 one of many small elegances you see in every Sally Wainwright script. Ilinka has info. An unidentified victim of the serial killer might be her missing friend Aurelia, and Ilinka might know who\u2019s responsible: the Knezovic family, who Catherine knows as the \u201cHalifax mafia\u201d. Is a human-trafficking ring taking us too far away from the gritty domesticity Happy Valley trades on? Maybe, but probably not: last year we saw how much the international drugs trade is flourishing in Yorkshire. This plot\u2019s also given us the marvellous Winnie, played by Angela Pleasence, stalwart of 70s costume drama and horror, and daughter of Donald. Tiny, twinkly and tough, Winnie is at least a surrogate aunt to Catherine and possibly a full surrogate mum. That means she\u2019ll probably die horribly, so enjoy her now. \u201cAre you alright, son?\u201d Meanwhile, Tommy Lee Royce is let out of prison to attend the funeral of his murdered mother, Lynn. A quietly daring scene again asks us to find sympathy for the devil: the prison officers who bring Tommy the news recognise how emotionally overwhelming it must be. A stunned Catherine relays the news to Ann, who has already had traumatic memories stirred by joining John on house-to-house inquiries along the street where Tommy raped and imprisoned her. An awkward exchange between the police rookie and the troubled detective includes John recklessly asking how to come upon \u00a31,000 in a hurry. They bond over that, and over Ann losing her mother to cancer. There\u2019s a telling moment where John lightly grasps Ann\u2019s arm, then thinks better of it. Sally Wainwright always finds time for that sort of simple human drama amid the more explosive storytelling. See also the scene after Helen\u2019s funeral, in which a tearful dad and daughter \u2013 Nevison and Ann \u2013 say they love each other, while also seamlessly mentioning Sam, the feckless ex-employee who might be a murderer. Sam shows up at Helen\u2019s wake, where he\u2019s eyeballed by Catherine. But she has other things on her mind. Lynn\u2019s funeral is \u2013 what are the odds? \u2013 on the same day and at the same crematorium Helen\u2019s loved ones have just left. And Catherine\u2019s going back. Time for a stunning set piece, as Catherine \u2013 a fearless gran warrior in her Parka \u2013 stands behind Tommy and waits for him to notice her. James Norton is all muscle and fury, sobbing helplessly one second, then screaming \u201cYou filthy fucking whore!\u201d the next. The pair are only reunited briefly, and Wainwright has to get her storyline crowbar out to do it, but it doesn\u2019t disappoint. As we all muse on the brass balls required to antagonise a rapist by ruining his last moment with his mother, Catherine is in the cemetery, visiting her daughter Becky. Her phone goes and it\u2019s Mike, livid at her funeral stunt and worried that Catherine still hasn\u2019t provided an alibi for Lynn\u2019s murder. Catherine says it\u2019s her day off, and oh, she can\u2019t prove where she was on those crucial days. Just as we only have Catherine\u2019s word that Tommy brutalised Becky, the faint suspicion that Catherine did kill Lynn is left to linger. When Catherine finally returns to Helen\u2019s wake, her sister is drunk. Siobhan Finneran is brilliant at Clare\u2019s jittery vulnerability and now she\u2019s brilliant as a snarling addict who\u2019s relapsed. A superb two-hander lays years of sibling resentment bare \u2013 Clare hissing in Catherine\u2019s face that she\u2019s \u201cthe Gesssssstapo!\u201d is a great moment. Last we see, Catherine is helplessly chasing Clare into the night, begging her not to put herself in danger. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done it! You shouldn\u2019t! Have! Done it!\u201d For light relief, we turn to John, the ineffectual detective who\u2019s dumped his unstable mistress and is now being blackmailed. His new plan: lie to Vicky that he\u2019s left his wife to be with her, then go round and charm her into giving up those compromising photos. Problem one is that there\u2019s no way to establish that Vicky hasn\u2019t backed up the photos. Problem two is that she enjoys taunting John about this over dinner. Fine work from Amelia Bullmore as Vicky tipsily, dementedly laughs in John\u2019s face \u2013 but that\u2019s all we\u2019re getting from her. As she\u2019s fixing dessert, John starts frantically unplugging her PC. She whacks him with an ice-cream scoop; he strangles her to death with the computer flex. There\u2019s blood and Shiraz all over Vicky\u2019s rug. What happens next? On the one hand, John\u2019s a homicide detective who knows what evidence needs to be scrubbed away. But he\u2019s also a bumbling nervebag who has already let on to his smart young colleague that he\u2019s had an affair, and that he\u2019s desperate for money. John\u2019s had it. Catherine Cawood, super-cop Our hero\u2019s almost impossibly fine detective skills are a delight. Did she get Sean\u2019s number plate when he flashed past last week? Yes! But now for a stiffer test. Did she notice Frances, the stranger at Lynn\u2019s funeral who briefly turned when she came in and was shocked to see her? It\u2019ll certainly be useful if she has memorised her face, because Frances\u2019s uncanny success in finding work as Ryan\u2019s teaching assistant means they\u2019re bound to meet soon. You what, love? Several commenters said episode one contained Jamaica Inn-ish mumbling. Critics\u2019 preview episodes are often not quite finished, so I\u2019d dismissed the fact that I noticed this too, thinking it\u2019d be corrected before broadcast. Perhaps not. This week, for the second episode running, I lost some of Sarah Lancashire\u2019s dialogue when Catherine was talking to Mike on the stairs in the nick. Any problems out there? Tweet of the week \u201cIt\u2019s even more fun if you imagine that this is Molesley\u2019s grandson.\u201d Try souping up the predicament John (played, of course, by Downton Abbey star Kevin Doyle) finds himself in by taking the critic Paul Whitelaw\u2019s advice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
