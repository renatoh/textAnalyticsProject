The furniture designer's personal epiphany occurred in the late Seventies, when he was working as a design engineer on Richard Rogers's Lloyd's of London building. One minute he was hard at work detailing the pipework, the next he was putting a 'back in five minutes' note on his drawing board and exiting the Portakabin, never to return. 'Basically, I threw a tantrum,' he tells me, with that still-enjoying-the-liberating-feeling twinkle in his eye. Someone else doubtless finished off the pipework, but engineering's loss was definitely furniture's gain. For plenty of designers, the fame is all in the prototype - the in-your-face pieces that wow the critics but never see the light of manufacturing day. Terence Woodgate was never one of those. His early, late-Eighties designs, such as the wave-fronted River cabinets for the Spanish company Punt Mobles, and the PSS airport seating range (for SCP in the early Nineties) are still going strong, as are the creative partnerships he forged back then. This year in Milan, Woodgate presented Slow, his fifth sofa for SCP - a tilted L-shape, retro-chic affair with moveable triangular arm-rests and a simple pair of solid bars for legs. Very snazzy. There too was his new range of Disc cabinets (the handles are sunken discs) - a contender in this year's Elle Decoration Awards. Both designs prove that he's as on top of his game as ever. Before I went to meet him, everyone I spoke to told me what a lovely, easy-going fellow Terence Woodgate was - and he is. But nobody told me he had such a blindingly desirable house. The family (wife Paula, and teenage sons, James and Tom), moved to this unusual, mostly single-storey red-brick pavilion, in the back lanes of the Kent/East Sussex borders, from De Beauvoir Town in Islington, a decade ago. The architects Wells Mackereth helped them knock the inside of the former sanatorium building (originally attached to a public school) into thoroughly Modernist shape. When they bought the house, a deep thicket of 15ft rhod0dendrons obscured the view. Now it's there to be relished in all its ridiculously bucolic glory. 'It's amazing how quickly the new leaves come,' says Woodgate wistfully as he stands on his terrace, a city-reared boy (born London, 1953) now gone a bit soft on the country. In person, the designer is relaxed and funny, with a dancer's way of moving. With infectious, boyish enthusiasm, he removes his new Zvezdochka shoes - designed by Marc Newson for Nike - to demonstrate their ingenuity (the inner sock comes out to leave a kind of jelly sandal). This house's inner proportions suit him down to the ground, not least because he's a modernist through and through. (Of his college days, he says: 'Memphis passed me by - it went straight over my head - luckily!') From the central hallway, oak floors stretch into the distance in both directions, accompanied by an orderly queue of tall windows. In the welcoming kitchen/diner, the palette is a combination of powerful and muted: the black ply of the Eames's LCM dining chairs (Charles is Woodgate's design hero), the dark-navy units, a brick-red canvas. I'm particularly taken with the bar stool - a rubber-seated, zig-zagged black metal construction called Zeus, purchased in the Eighties by Woodgate. Like the bright-green plastic Seventies record player in the living room, it's the kind of original touch that stops this house from being too minimal. Most of the furniture is his own: a Sussex sideboard (its slatted doors inspired by local barns - he's currently building a new studio along similar lines), a great swathe of modular sofa, the glass double-decker coffee table, Sax (a bestseller, whose legs work purely by suction). 'Mostly I design things because I can't get anything I want,' says Woodgate simply. He begins with a sketch (though the final designs are done on an impressive pair of computer screens with inter-connecting desktops). 'It's very free and childlike at first, you don't know where it's going, but then some essential character comes out and you try and save it.' The skill, he says, is in translating that into a design. One chair he showed me, for the Italian manufacturer Montina, was inspired by a Brad Lochore painting of a Venetian blind - the 'diffused radius' of the legs by Lochore's soft shadows. But this house is no one-man show. Paula's stunning collection of ceramic vases pepper the chic white shelving (she has, says Terence, a great eye), while exotic artefacts - such as a tree-branch ladder from Mali - serve as sculpture. As a place to live and work, it seems perfect; but Woodgate is not smug. Only once does he say anything remotely boastful, when we're discussing the trend for celebrities-turned-designers. We agree it's a terrible idea, but, 'Sometimes I enjoy it,' he confesses. 'It makes me feel very secure in my role.' www.scp.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
