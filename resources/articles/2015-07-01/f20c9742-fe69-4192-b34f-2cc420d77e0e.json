The Chelsea striker bludgeoned his way to 20 goals in a rollercoaster first season in England following his \u00a332m move from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but also attracted controversy, receiving a three-match ban for an off-the-ball stamp on Liverpool\u2019s Emre Can in January. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have done anything malicious; I\u2019ve not had a red card so why change anything about the way I am?\u201d said Costa. \u201cI\u2019ve always played this way for all the sides I\u2019ve been with and I\u2019ve always scored a lot of goals in this style. \u201cThe key for me is to score goals and win trophies. If I change in any way, I\u2019m not going to be the same player. I feel very much at ease and neither the manager nor anyone else at the club has said anything to me, and at no point have I shown any lack of loyalty at all and so that is good enough for me.\u201d Costa is looking ahead to the upcoming battles with relish. Mourinho has hinted here that Chelsea may operate with two strikers this season, the manager not always sending out Costa as his battering ram. The 26-year-old could be partnered with Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, the France international, or Radamel Falcao, his former striker partner from Atl\u00e9tico. Either way, Costa cannot wait. \u201cGoals are what count for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a battle with defenders. Fighting hard, giving everything and working hard on the field you have to combine with the goals you score. It doesn\u2019t matter if defenders want to battle with me or not, I will just be trying to do my job as well as I possibly can. \u201cDo I enjoy the aggression of English football? No, I like to play football, I like to score goals, I like to do things well. You can get different types of games, some which are more of a battle, some which are less hard fought. I think it depends on each game, how you feel a game happens to be going, how you are playing at a given time, as no two games are the same.\u201d Falcao finally joined up with the Chelsea squad here this week and was looking sharp in training as Mourinho put the Colombian through his paces.The Chelsea manager remains typically confident and bullish about the prospect of Falcao\u2019s difficult spell at Manchester United last season not being repeated at Stamford Bridge. Costa knows Falcao well following their time in La Liga \u2013 they won the Copa del Rey together against a Real Madrid side managed by Mourinho \u2013 and welcomes his old friend to England. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a couple of seasons with Falcao and I reckon things went fairly well,\u201d Costa said. \u201cHe did a lot for me and he\u2019s a great striker. \u201cWhether the manager chooses to play us alongside each other, that\u2019s one for him to decide, but let\u2019s hope he gets here soon because he is a very talented player who needs a bit of affection, and people here cannot wait for him to arrive to help us out because he is a key player who will be decisive for us. \u201cHe\u2019s a top bloke too. He gets on very well with his team-mates and he will help us a lot off the field, in the dressing room. He is a really big-hearted guy and that\u2019s the most important thing. He is going to get everything he needs. And here\u2019s hoping he can be the same player that he has been throughout his career. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be fine. I suffered an injury similar to his in 2011 and now I\u2019m fine. All he needs is the consistency of regular football and to feel loved, which I think he\u2019ll get from the manager, as well as his teammates who will all be there for him. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for us that he didn\u2019t have the best of seasons as that\u2019s why he\u2019s now with us. Radamel knows the sort of manager Mourinho is. He\u2019s a manager who is liked by players because he trusts and backs them. He doesn\u2019t sign a player just for the sake of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
