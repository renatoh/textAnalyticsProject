I won't bore you with the details: all I want to know is how can I get someone at the end of that stupid customer service phone line to take me seriously. Has anyone ever managed to get some satisfaction without having to call on Tony Levene? If so, how? Ain't the Co-op brilliant! I've used Co-op bank for years and have always received intelligent, cooperative(!) service. No judgment, no patronising, no diminishing the problem. Only once was there a situation the person could not immediately resolve and I was transferred to someone who could - brilliant. Remember to tell your existing bank why they are losing your custom. Val Cole, Devon Copy and paste Keep a log of any conversations with any organisation, not just banks - times, dates, names, details. As soon as it's clear you are going in circles, contact the chief executive or managing director by very polite but assertive letter. Include everything relevant, stating clearly at the outset what your issue is. Ensure you add a statement of what you want to happen. I usually copy the letter to another director (finance, who will care that you might leave their service, or marketing, who will care that you might tell others) and to the customer service email address. I have done this with banks and telecom and utility providers. In one case, I had a letter from the chairman and a designated contact provided to resolve my issue within 48 hours. Becky John, Southampton Become informed I got satisfaction, so to speak, by calling on Guardian Money's Tony Levene two years ago. He helped settle a dispute with Argos. I realise, however, he is in much demand so you may need to find alternative help in your own problem. Keep up to date with financial news and any current developments - looking at Money every Saturday is a good place to start. Then there's the Guardian Unlimited Money website and others such as MoneySavingExpert.com. Reading these will give you the confidence to deal with your bank and to know your rights. David Salter, Cardiff The problem is closer to home Judging from the tone of your question, you have what my daughter would call an attitude problem. Yes, it is annoying to press all those numbers, but if you remember that the person you eventually get is a human being like yourself and treat them as such, you should have no problems. I have dealt with banks, phone companies and computer helplines and invariably found them courteous and helpful. Could your problem be your own telephone manner? William Wood, Etchingham The pen is mightier ... Stop phoning and start writing. A letter must be replied to, providing you with documentary evidence of your complaint. Carefully craft your letter so it is short, succinct and polite. If registered or marked \"hand delivered\" it cannot be lost in the post. Diarise to send a polite reminder 14 days after the initial letter. The bank's response should be carefully digested and a reply should never be dispatched on the day of its receipt, so avoiding a knee-jerk emotional response. Keep a record in chronological order of all the correspondence with the bank. Paul Forrester, Croydon, who wins this week's \u00a325 National Book Token That personal touch Don't use these centralised catch-all numbers. My local branch of Barclays still has accessible people who will give you a business card with their branch phone number and deal efficiently with problems. They may not be the \"best buy\" current account in strict money terms, but I am increasingly persuaded that good, personal service has increased in worth as it has become more scarce. June Parkin, Barnard Castle If at first you don't succeed ... Ombudsman rulings are bad publicity, time consuming and expensive. Be clear from the outset that you will take your case to the ombudsman unless the matter is properly resolved. Get hold of the bank's own procedure for resolving disputes and see if they follow them. If they don't, they won't want that fact exposed at any hearing. Forget about the inappropriately named phone helpline and put your grievances in writing - essential to prove consistency and reasonableness on your part. It also allows you to escalate, as necessary, from customer services to chief executive. The written record will also be the evidence that leads the bank to a proper settlement. And finally, sadly, be as persistent as you need to be - don't give in. It might take time, but if the bank is in the wrong somebody senior and sensible will want to reach that proper settlement before the actual referral to the ombudsman. Mark Wheeler, London Higher and higher With respect, this is the wrong question. Never, ever use a customer service phoneline for anything other than the most trivial query. Your solicitor would never dream of picking up the phone on your behalf, they would write a letter - it's the difference between instant nonsense and valuable, albeit slower, information. You need a signed reply on headed notepaper for which someone can be held accountable. You're never going to get that on the phone. Write once, followed by a reminder copy of the same letter a fortnight later. On every successive week after that write to the next higher level. You'll be with the CEO inside a month - it works every time for me. Brian Harrison-Jennings, Huddersfield An insider speaks I work in customer service for a mobile phone company. Take it from me that the best way to get satisfaction from a call centre, especially when complaining, is to not get angry. We speak to many angry customers each day, and usually their reasons for being so are not justified, so shouting stops having the desired effect after a while. The only time I would go above and beyond the norm for a customer is if I genuinely sympathise with their situation. Explain yourself rationally, allow the customer service assistant (CSA) to ask appropriate questions, and do not demand to speak to a manager unless you have a particular reason to think the individual CSA is incompetent. Managers are there to manage the staff, not to offer customers more options, and are usually encouraged to back-up what the CSA has said. Name and address supplied Branch out If you have a local branch, even if your account is not held there, go to the customer service desk and explain all. The queue forming behind you will be interested to hear your grievances, and it may spur them on to settle some of theirs too. Make sure they actually acknowledge you have a problem, ask them how they intend to deal with it and the time scale involved in getting it sorted. Ann Newell, Oxfordshire This week's question: My 28-year-old son is making his first property purchase - a \u00a3225,000 two-bed flat in London that he's buying with a friend. He earns \u00a326,000 a year and his share of the mortgage is \u00a3100,000. He's stretched himself to the limit. Is this the worst decision of his life? Any ideas?
