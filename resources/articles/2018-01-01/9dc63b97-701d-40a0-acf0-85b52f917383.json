The federal government is preparing to slowly cut its funding to a widely used support and recovery service for people severely impacted by mental illness, known as the personal helpers and mentors (Phams) program. The funding is being withdrawn on the assumption that those now in the program will be eligible for the NDIS and can use that money to pay for Phams or a similar support. But early data shows that is not occurring. Eight hundred of the program\u2019s participants were expected to move to the NDIS last financial year. Almost three-quarters, or about 586, did not end up with NDIS funding, according to a newly published Senate estimates response from the Department of Social Services. About 231 were deemed ineligible for the scheme, owing to their age, residency, or because they did not meet disability requirements. A further 158 Phams clients withdrew their access requests, while 162 declined to move to the NDIS, and 35 had not returned their access request form. The Community Mental Health Australia\u2019s executive director, Amanda Bresnan, said the early figures were alarming. At last count, there were about 20,337 participants in the program who would need to be moved to NDIS funding by 2019-20. If the trend continued, Bresnan said, thousands of Australians could be left without support. She said the government appeared to be unprepared for the problems of transitioning the program\u2019s participants to the NDIS. \u201cThat, for us, is a really big mistake that\u2019s been made,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to actually understand it because we need to be prepared for those people who are found ineligible. What do they need? What does that support look like? To not have considered that, that\u2019s a big failing.\u201d A Department of Social Services spokeswoman said those not eligible for the NDIS would \u201ccontinue to receive similar levels of support\u201d through other federal programs while longer-term arrangements were finalised. \u201cThe government provided $80m to target services for people with mental illness outside the NDIS in the 2017-18 budget,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government has also funded a number of sector development fund projects to provide additional support for vulnerable people to better engage with the NDIS.\u201d Bresnan said it was still unclear how the government would achieve continuity of care for all those in the Phams program. She said the federal government had to now quickly work out what would happen to people falling through the cracks of the NDIS. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this brinkmanship where no one is wanting to take responsibility, yet this massive scheme is rolling on,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the point at which you need to address the issues and get it right so that people won\u2019t fall off the edge of a cliff and have nothing to support them.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time concerns have been raised about the NDIS\u2019s ability to offer support to those with a psychosocial disability. Late last year Guardian Australia revealed that individuals with severe mental illness were routinely being denied funding support under the NDIS. At full operation, the scheme is only designed to support 12% to 13% of those experiencing severe mental illness. NDIS-funded supports are designed to complement the existing mental health system, not replace it. The national disability insurance agency has released details of a tailored pathway to access the NDIS for people with a psychosocial disability. The pathway is expected to help address issues accessing the scheme. Leading mental health experts say psychosocial disabilities have been treated as an afterthought in the scheme, rushed in at the last moment. Bresnan said the NDIA was now turning its attention many of the problems with psychosocial support. On 19 January 2018 the headline and standfirst on this article were amended. The original headline, \u201cAlmost 75% of people on mental health program left without NDIS support\u201d, was inaccurate because it conflated those who had been denied NDIS funding with those who had voluntarily withdrawn applications or not completed an assessment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
