Daschle, the former South Dakota senator who was ousted in 2004 in an aggressive Republican push for his seat, has had a close working relationship with Obama for at least four years. He was a mentor to Obama when Illinois senator joined the Senate in 2005 and was a key adviser to Barack Obama's campaign. The Obama transition team has yet formally to announce Daschle's taking of the position, but several news organisations today reported the offer had been extended and that Daschle had accepted. The news indicates that the once-tight Obama team has sprung leaks as Obama has expanded his transition effort beyond the close-knit circle of aides who managed the campaign. Obama had hoped first to announce his national security and economic teams before making public other cabinet posts. Daschle is also a departure from Obama's thus-far Clinton-heavy line-up. Obama chose as his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, a former White House political aide to Bill Clinton. Former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta is heading Obama's transition team, and Obama is reportedly strongly considering Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state. In addition, Obama this week asked Eric Holder, a former top justice department official under Clinton, to be attorney general. Daschle was friendly with Bill Clinton but never worked for him, and they were not known as close allies. As secretary of the department of health and human services, Daschle will likely head up administration efforts to expand health insurance coverage, an area Obama has signalled will be a top early priority after his inauguration in January. Daschle will oversee the development of health policy, and, given his extensive contacts in the Senate, will likely help shepherd legislation through Congress. Obama's close ties to Daschle are illustrated in his choice yesterday of Pete Rouse as senior White House adviser. Rouse was Daschle's chief of staff for 19 years before joining Obama's Senate office as chief of staff. Daschle was elected to the Senate in 1986 and in 1994 became leader of the Senate Democrats, then in the minority. The Democrats regained majority status in May 2001 when Vermont senator Jim Jeffords switched parties, throwing control of the evenly divided Senate. But Democratic losses in 2002 returned control of the Senate to the Republican party, demoralising Daschle and allowing the Republicans to weaken him by portraying him as an obstructionist. But in 2004, Senate Republicans broke with tradition and launched a full assault on Daschle. Both parties poured millions into the state for the fight. Opponent John Thune said Daschle was out of touch with South Dakota values and was a toady for more Democrats like liberal senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and the Clintons. Although Daschle won 62% of the vote in 1998, Thune in 2004 bested him 51% to 49%. Before joining the Senate, the South Dakota native was an intelligence officer in the US air force and a member of the House of Representatives. Since leaving the Senate he has been a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress, a liberal policy thinktank founded by Podesta. He is married and has three children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
