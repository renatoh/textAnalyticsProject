The appeal lies not just in the reach of the television coverage - an estimated 3.7 billion viewers in 220 countries tuned in to watch the Sydney Olympics - but also in the connotations of cooperation, inclusion and sportsmanship which pervade the games. At 40% of marketing revenue, sponsorship is the second-largest income stream for the Olympics, just behind broadcast rights, which provide 50%. In recognition of the fact that the Games could not take place without sponsorship income, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) works hard to safeguard the rights of its sponsors. Some rights are easy to protect. The Olympic symbol enjoys international protection similar to trademark protection. In the UK, a special act of parliament was passed in 1995, dedicated to protecting various interests associated with the games and entrusting them to the British Olympic Association. The act prohibits commercial use of the \"rings\" symbol, the motto Citius, Altius, Fortius (and its English translation \"Faster, Higher, Stronger\") and the words Olympic, Olympiad, Olympian andtheir plurals without a licence from the BOA. The Olympic Symbols Protection Act and its overseas equivalents rule out direct association with the Games, unless this association has been paid for. But imaginative companies will always find ways around these rules, a practice which has become known as \"ambush marketing\". There are different levels of sponsors attracting different marketing rights. \"Top Partner\" status for the Athens Olympics secures worldwide exclusive rights, including use of Olympic imagery, hospitality opportunities, direct advertising - encompassing preferential access to Olympic broadcast advertising, on-site concessions and ambush marketing protection. A company does not need to have the Olympic rings on its packaging to associate its products with the Games in the minds of the public. For example, advertisements featuring athletes and aired at the time of the Olympics will inevitably be connected with the Games by viewers. Just such an association was engineered by Pepsi, which launched a television advertising campaign featuring Magic Johnson, two weeks before the 1992 Olympics began. Coca Cola was understandably irritated, having spent what is thought to have been \u00a318m for its official sponsor status. In recent years, the IOC has made efforts to combat the rise in ambush marketing. In a further battle in the war between Pepsi and Coke, the Sydney Olympics saw the confiscation of Pepsi cans from spectators to protect the rights of the official sponsor. This may have drawn more attention to Pepsi than it would have gained had no action been taken. This year, the IOC is taking no risks. According to the terms and conditions of admission, spectators at the Athens Games will find themselves unable to enter the Olympic stadia with any food or drink, including water and ice trays - arguably a dangerous move in a venue as hot as Athens in August. Spectators will find their entry barred if they are wearing promotional clothing, if that clothing does not bear the hallmarks of an official sponsor. \"Coordinated group promotion\" is also outlawed, and members of the audience sitting next to each other wearing clothing with letters on which together spell out a commercial, political or religious message will find themselves on the wrong side of the ticket barriers. The terms and conditions allow for the organising committee to deal on the spot with any methods of ambush marketing which emerge during the Athens Games, by including a catch-all provision for the prohibition of \"inappropriate\" objects, as well as a right to alter the list of banned items at any time. There are some surprising consequences of certain companies' sponsorship of the Athens Games. For example, it is not possible to purchase a ticket to the Olympics using any credit card other than a Visa card, Visa being a sponsor of the Games. Such fringe benefits of sponsorship result in a large proportion of sponsors renewing their connection with the Games year after year. Indeed, Federal Express, which withdrew its sponsorship in 1984, may well regret this decision 20 years on. As well as restraining wide-scale marketing from various unauthorised sources, the terms and conditions of ticket sales for the Athens Olympics also seek to prevent small companies from cashing in on the reputation of the Games. As an example, tickets may not be used as prizes for competitions without the written approval of the organising committee. The Athens organising committee has already rid the city of 10,000 billboards and has imposed strict controls on the remaining hoardings, preserving them for the Games' sponsors. But while bodies such as the IOC can legislate about what visitors can eat, drink and wear and who can advertise in the proximity of the Games, they cannot dictate the associations that the public will form between events and companies. In a spectacular marketing coup, Nike launched a theme-park in Paris to coincide with the 1998 World Cup. The park was opened by the Brazilian football team and attracted more than a quarter of a million visitors during the World Cup period. Nike also sponsored a number of teams competing in the Cup. Following the cup, Nike had achieved 32% sponsor recognition, compared with 35% recognition for Adidas, the official event sponsor, whose logo appeared at the edge of the pitch. Try as they might to plug all of the holes through which ambush marketers have so far slipped, it seems unlikely that the IOC will be entirely successful at Athens 2004. Just as hackers will always find ways around the technological armour of the software houses, it is inevitable that ambush marketers will continue to come up with ingenious means to circumvent the measures taken by the Olympics' official bodies to protect the rights of the official sponsors. \u00b7 Andrew Hobson is a partner and head of intellectual property at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain and was assisted in the article by solicitor Gemma Cullis"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
