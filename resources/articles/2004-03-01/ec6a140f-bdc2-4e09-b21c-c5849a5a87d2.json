Take Bolton Wanderers, whose manager, Sam Allardyce, decided that this season the FA Cup was not for them, fielded a team of odds and sods against Tranmere Rovers and declared himself satisfied when they went out to the Nationwide side in the third round. There was still the Carling Cup, but come the final of that selling plater and all of Bolton's impressive back-up staff of physiotherapists, psychologists, nutritionists, spiritualists and Seventh-Day Adventists could not help a team left behind by Middlesbrough at the start. Manchester United's cavalier attitude towards the Cup threatens them with a humiliating nemesis now that they have gone out of the Champions League and are falling behind in the Premiership. If, as seems likely, Bolton achieve their highest position yet in the Premiership, Allardyce will at least be able to claim that the ends justified the means. Not so Sir Alex Ferguson, for whom even the lone presence of the Cup in the Old Trafford trophy room next season would be a reminder of this season's failures in the Premiership and Champions League. Five years ago the Cup was one of the jewels gleaming brightly in Manchester United's unique triple crown, whereupon they abandoned it, with the connivance of the Football Association, in order to compete in Fifa's folly, the World Club Championship. To help England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup, United said. To earn a few bob, said others. Now Ferguson needs to win the Cup not so much to avoid his fourth trophyless season since the Premier League started but to allay the growing suspicion that an era is ending. Should United lose at Highbury in a fortnight's time, a result that would leave Arsenal looking even more like champions than they do now, the need to beat Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team in the Cup semi-finals a week later would become paramount. A fourth Double for Arsenal would be further evidence that the balance of power in English football has swung away from Old Trafford. But not yet. After Manchester United had gone out of the Champions League to Porto's late goal at Old Traf ford on Tuesday night there was a tendency to dance on a grave not dug. The list of Ferguson's mistakes in buying, selling, team selection and tactics, not to mention his horsing around over the Rock's stud fees, made a change from reading about his achievements but the reality is that he has done far more right by United than he will ever do wrong. Eras in football do not end suddenly, they just dwindle away. Arsenal's reign of the 1930s really ended only in the early 1950s and there was a world war in between. The Heysel disaster of 1985 finished Liverpool's predominance in Europe and the Hillsborough tragedy four years later, which was followed by Arsenal snatching the league title from under their noses with the last kick of the 1988-89 season, gave Anfield notice that its near monopoly of the championship was about to end. Nevertheless Kenny Dalglish's side went on to regain the title the following year before his stressful departure and the subsequent break-up of a successful squad left Liverpool in a limbo from which they have yet fully to return. Superficially at least there are grounds for seeing in what has happened at Old Trafford this season similarities to Liverpool's decline. Outstanding players have been replaced by lesser players, good passing habits have given way to fitful errors, the fluency has gone, the ball is less easily played from back to front. The sale of David Beckham to Real Madrid will continue to be flung in Ferguson's face but he can no more be blamed for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who might have filled in effectively for Beckham on the right, missing most of this season through injury than Phil Neville needlessly conceding the free-kick that led to Porto's decisive goal on Tuesday night. United may only be experiencing a glitch. They have still accumulated four points more than they had at this stage last season, when they came from behind to regain the title five ahead of Arsenal. The difference of course is that this time the roles are reversed: Wenger's side is thriving, Ferguson's faltering. And as Fergie said after Tuesday's Champions League exit: \"These things happen.\" He could with justification have repeated his gut reaction to United's winning of the 1999 Champions League final with two goals in stoppage-time: \"Football, bloody hell!\" The dividing line between heaven and Hades can be a goal wrongly denied, a gormless foul, a goalkeeping gaffe or a moment's loss of defensive concentration. But, if it makes Manchester United look with renewed affection on the FA Cup, something positive may yet emerge from Old Trafford's season. The Cup saved Ferguson in 1990. This is more or less where he came in. Whatever happens, for club and manager, it will have been a humbling experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
