United can move within one point of Chelsea, with two games in hand, should they defeat Luis Felipe Scolari's side. \"If we can get within a couple of points of Chelsea and we've games in hand, then we're in a great position,\" said Ferguson, who will be hoping his side leapfrog Chelsea three days later when they play Wigan at home in one of those games in hand. Ferguson has questioned the fixtures list recently, bemoaning the fact that his side have had to play all the other top six teams away from home in the first half of the season. But this perceived disadvantage will become a boon when the champions welcome these sides to Old Trafford during the run in. Ferguson noted that the second and final league fixture between the two clubs who have won the last four titles was, on 11 January, coming much earlier than previous seasons. \"It's been later - in the last two or three games - for the last two seasons. It doesn't matter when you play Chelsea, though, it's always going to be a massive game,\" the Scot told Inside United magazine. \"That will be a big game. It's unusual to have it in January, it's usually towards the end of the season.\" Every season since 2002-03, the Red Devils have faced Chelsea in the closing weeks of the season, with their summit meetings frequently termed title deciders. \"It's a little different with the timing, but we're still aiming to win it,\" said Ferguson. United achieved a creditable 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge in September, but since then Chelsea lost their 86-game unbeaten home record to Liverpool, with Arsenal also taking all three points away to Chelsea. Newcastle, Spurs and West Ham have, like United, also gone to Stamford Bridge and gained a point. \"They've done very well away from home but not so well at home so it's been interesting from them this season,\" said the Scot. United currently lie third, seven points behind leaders Liverpool, with two games in hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
