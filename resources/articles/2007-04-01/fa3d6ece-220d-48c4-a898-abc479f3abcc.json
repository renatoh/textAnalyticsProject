Mike Bennett scored twice for the champions and James Roby continued his impressive form with another eyecatching try to match his individual effort at Wigan on Good Friday as Saints climbed above the Rhinos on points difference to leave Salford in deep trouble near the bottom. Bradford stayed within two points of Saints and climbed to third with a 36-24 win at Wakefield. David Solomona, the skilful New Zealand forward who joined the Bulls from Trinity during the winter, scored Bradford's second try after making the first of two for his fellow Kiwi Lesley Vainikolo. Whitehaven led a clean sweep for Cumbria's three clubs, winning 18-12 at Leigh to make it two wins out of two in Co-operative National League One. Barrow also maintained their 100% record in the Second Division by winning 35-30 at Swinton and Workington bounced back from defeat at Barrow on Good Friday by thrashing Gateshead Thunder 68-0. Last season's second division winners Dewsbury enjoyed their first win at the higher level in National League One, a 27-24 success at Halifax, and a late try earned Batley a 22-22 draw against Sheffield Eagles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
