The Bible, whose pages teem with dragons, monkeys, peacocks, intricate geometric patterns and a slightly alarmed Jonah entering the whale\u2019s mouth head first, took 10 months to complete and would have demanded careful study. But the scribe\u2019s wish was not to be fulfilled. Sixteen years later Spain\u2019s Jews \u2013 who had already endured a century of persecution that led many to convert to Catholicism \u2013 were ordered to leave the country by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. The expulsion cast the family and their precious Bible into exile. From Spain, the book was taken to Portugal, North Africa, Gibraltar and Scotland before finally ending up in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Today, after 527 peripatetic years, the book is finally coming home \u2013 albeit temporarily. The Kennicott Bible, named after Benjamin Kennicott, the scholar and librarian on whose advice the work was bought by Oxford University, has been loaned to the regional government of Galicia and will be on show in Santiago de Compostela from Friday until next April. It forms the centrepiece of the first of three major exhibitions intended to reflect on Galicia\u2019s contributions to world culture and history. \u201cThe Kennicott is one of the world\u2019s great Bibles and it has a dual value: a technical one because of its spectacular artistry, but also a symbolic one,\u201d said Rom\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, minister for culture and tourism in the regional government. \u201cIt shows how, at one time, people of three religions \u2013 Jews, Muslims and Catholics \u2013 coexisted in Spain. It also shows that there was a strong cultural and economic Jewish presence in Galicia, but which was forced out \u2013 as Jews were in the rest of Spain.\u201d Despite the Kennicott\u2019s Galician heritage and global renown, Rodr\u00edguez said the region had no plans to ask for its permanent return: \u201cIt\u2019s Galician, no matter where it is.\u201d His words will have soothed C\u00e9sar Merch\u00e1n-Hamann, curator of Hebraica and Judaica at the Bodleian. Merch\u00e1n-Hamann describes the Kennicott, illustrated by Joseph Ibn Hayyim, as the \u201cjewel in the crown\u201d of the collection he oversees. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and unique,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a lot survived of the whole tradition of manuscript production in the Spanish lands, Christian and Muslim, through the middle ages.\u201d For Merch\u00e1n-Hamann and his fellow scholars, the Kennicott represents the last great cultural cry of a community that was being slowly but surely squeezed out of existence. While the casual observer might detect Islamic influences in its painstaking geometric designs, or Christian overtones to its animal illuminations, the Bible itself is the culmination of centuries of Judeo-Spanish tradition. \u201cIt just so happens that some of the things that people are very enchanted with, and which seem so creative, are also found on a few manuscripts that have survived from a lot earlier \u2013 two or three centuries before \u2013 and which display the same features here and there,\u201d said Merch\u00e1n-Hamann. \u201cYou realise that, great as the artist of the Kennicott may have been, these can\u2019t all be things that he thought of himself.\u201d While the Kennicott miraculously survived centuries of travel and exile and, in doing so, became a metaphor for Spain\u2019s scattered Jews, it remains a lonely exception. \u201cImagine if, because of some terrible catastrophe, most of English literature was lost, and you had to pick 10 books, or 20, or 50 out of thousands of works,\u201d said Merch\u00e1n-Hamann. \u201cIn many cases, the survival of books was completely random and you\u2019re in a terrible situation when you know there\u2019s something big behind all this but you can only try to reconstruct it. That\u2019s what makes it poignant.\u201d Still, he added, it is hard to imagine a finer surviving example than the Kennicott. The family that commissioned it would have to have been extraordinarily wealthy. Or, as Merch\u00e1n-Hamann put it: \u201cIt would be the equivalent of buying a small yacht.\u201d The curator and his colleagues found it hard to let the Bible out of their care for five months but are pleased that it is returning to where it was created. \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing one of your children go,\u201d said Merch\u00e1n-Hamann. \u201cYou worry, you fret, but it was so thrilling to see it going back to Spain. It\u2019s very good to have it shown there so that people can see what was there at one point and which is there no more.\u201d Heritage and exile The expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 saw people resettling in North Africa, the Ottoman empire, Latin America and other parts of Christian Europe. They took with them their own Judeo-Spanish language, known as Ladino, which is still spoken in some communities today. Traces of Jewish life in Spain were sometimes erased after 1492, the year that marked an end to Muslim political power in the Iberian peninsula, whose architectural legacy survives in buildings such as C\u00f3rdoba\u2019s mosque-cathedral and the Alhambra in Granada. However, many towns and cities still have well-preserved Jewish quarters. Toledo is home to two medieval synagogues, El Tr\u00e1nsito and Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca, the latter of which has also served as a church, a barracks, a warehouse and a museum over the course of its 900-year history. In 2015 the Spanish government passed a law offering citizenship to descendants of expelled Jews to atone for the \u201chistorical wrong\u201d. At the end of the scheme in October this year, more than 132,000 people had applied from Latin America, the US, Israel, Turkey, France, the UK, Serbia and Montenegro, Morocco and Afghanistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
