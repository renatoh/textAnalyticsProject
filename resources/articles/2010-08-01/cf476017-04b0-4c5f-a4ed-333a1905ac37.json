With their nearest rivals Glamorgan and Northamptonshire getting the best of the week's fickle festival weather \u2013 at Colwyn Bay and Chesterfield respectively \u2013 the last thing Sussex wanted was to go into the final day depending on the generosity of their near neighbours, especially when Surrey are trying to salvage something of their season. However, if Sussex are to get something from this game they will have to rely on Surrey's ambitions dictating a chase for runs and points while batting last on a wicket that has seen only one half-century in six sessions. Yesterday, as both sides sought to make up time, the advantage seesawed back and forth, Sussex taking four good wickets before lunch, Surrey pushing on this afternoon. Steve Davies and Stewart Walters added 89 for the fifth wicket to establish a useful, but not decisive, lead of 75 before Stuart Meaker captured two late wickets, including the nightwatchman Monty Panesar. For Sussex, Yasir Arafat took five for 81, his best championship performance for Sussex since 2006, and even when Davies was accumulating his eighth half-century of the season he needed a couple of lives. The second came from Panesar, rumoured to be giving the ball more air this season but pretty reluctant to do so when Davies and Walters were around, although he did get both \u2013 the former Worcester wicketkeeper trying to work the ball and playing across the line, while Walters mistimed and was taken at wide mid-on. Chris Tremlett and Gareth Batty added the icing in a stand of 51 after tea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
