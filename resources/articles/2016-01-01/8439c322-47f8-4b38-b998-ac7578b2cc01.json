Although he did not mention Cruz by name, Rubio used an economic policy speech in his home state of Florida on Monday to suggest his rival would transform America into Europe by enacting a value-added tax (VAT). As if to rub salt in the wound, Rubio name-checked Republican hero Ronald Reagan as an opponent of a VAT and President Barack Obama as one of its proponents. \u201cBelieve it or not, multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSome even support imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against, called a Value Added Tax \u2013 also known as a VAT. \u201cIt attempts to trick people into believing their taxes are being lowered, when in reality they\u2019re simply being shifted to employers \u2013 meaning everyday Americans would feel its impact through higher prices and lower wages.\u201d Cruz has proposed to dramatically transform the existing tax code with a plan that would implement an individual 10% flat tax on income and replace corporate income and all payroll taxes with a 16% \u201cBusiness Flat Tax\u201d. The latter is essentially a rebranded name for a value-added tax (VAT), commonly used around the world but viewed with skepticism by many conservatives who see it as a vehicle for big government. According to an analysis of Cruz\u2019s tax plan by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, the US government \u201cwould raise 71% of all revenue from the new broad-based value-added tax,\u201d which would be levied on companies\u2019 profits but not purchases from other businesses or capital investments. Rubio on Monday said the implementation of a VAT in America would mirror Europe, where he argued the government has \u201cgrown in size\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that fans of the VAT include [House Democratic leader] Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, who called it a \u2018novel\u2019 idea,\u201d the Florida senator said. Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pushed back on Rubio\u2019s characterization in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cAnyone who has read the Cruz plan knows it doesn\u2019t feature a European-style national sales tax,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cInstead, his business flat tax is a proportionate tax on labor and capital, it dramatically simplifies taxes for businesses, and it is more competitive for capital investment and trade. It allows us to eliminate numerous other taxes, flatten the income tax rate down to 10 percent and provides full expensing of business investment.\u201d She added that Rubio\u2019s attacks on Cruz were designed to change the conversation from his record on immigration. \u201cRather than misconstruing our tax plan, Marco\u2019s time is probably better served explaining to voters why he continues to support amnesty and has recently tripled-down on offering in-state tuition for those who are here illegally,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThe reality is Marco will do and say anything to distract voters from his support for the Gang of Eight amnesty bill.\u201d Rand Paul has also embraced a VAT, under the moniker of a \u201cBusiness Transfer Tax\u201d, but there was little doubt Rubio\u2019s criticism was largely aimed at Cruz. The two senators are competing in the early states behind Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, whereas Paul barely registers in most polling. Cruz\u2019s campaign has, in the past, pointed to a number of influential conservatives who have embraced the idea of a VAT. But Rubio argued that by renaming it a \u201cBusiness Flat Tax\u201d, Republican candidates were attempting to veil their support for the essence of the proposal. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it acts like a VAT, taxes like a VAT, and grows government like a VAT \u2013 it\u2019s a VAT.\u201d Rubio also took thinly veiled jabs at the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, again without invoking their names, for backing an internet sales tax. \u201cThe internet is the marketplace of the 21st century and it\u2019s unacceptable that anyone who claims to be a conservative would join the liberal call for an online tax,\u201d Rubio said. The senator added he did not support new taxes \u201cof any kind\u201d, and would look to reform entitlement programs such as Medicare and social security to solve the nation\u2019s debt crisis. Rubio introduced a plan last year that would eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains, lower the corporate tax rate to 25% from 35% and set the top rate on wage income to 35% from 39.6%. The senator\u2019s opponents have said Rubio\u2019s plan disproportionately favors the wealthy. Rubio has also proposed creating a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child, and a tax break for employers that offer paid family leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
