The ability to create movement maps of anonymised data, meaning individuals could not be identified, could prove invaluable in evaluating and shaping the state response to the spread of the virus. The information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours rather than arrive in real time, but would still be able to show patterns such as whether people were avoiding the high street and heeding government advice to stay away from pubs, bars and restaurants. It could also be used to send health alerts to the public in specific locations, such as a city or town under lockdown, and would feed into decisions being made by health services. The UK is not the only country considering exploiting such data to tackle the spread of the virus. Israel and Austria are enlisting location data from mobile phone networks and the US is reportedly seeking to follow their lead. Donald Trump\u2019s administration is in \u201cactive talks\u201d with a number of tech companies on the issue, according to a report by the Washington Post on Thursday, exploring various options for how best to use location data. In the UK, mobile companies already know that government guidance to work from home is being heeded, as the commuter-hour spike in data usage of workers heading to and from their jobs is \u201cdead\u201d, according to one senior telecoms executive. \u201cWe are talking with the government about a number of areas in which we may be able to assist with the national public health effort,\u201d said a spokesman for BT. \u201cIn relation to the use of mobile data, we are still actively exploring possibilities. As always, we are mindful of the privacy of our customers, while making sure we do everything that might help the medical authorities in the fight against coronavirus.\u201d EE is one of the largest of the UK\u2019s big mobile companies \u2013 which include O2, Vodafone and Three UK \u2013 with more than 20 million customers. Vodafone has already helped the Italian government mapping out the movements of people in Lombardy, the centre of an outbreak that has seen large parts of the country put on lockdown. The UK\u2019s other major mobile operators say they have not yet engaged with the government over using customer data to fight the coronavirus. \u201cWe have not been asked,\u201d said a spokesman for Vodafone. An O2 spokesperson said the networks were helping model the spread of coronavirus, but were not handing over user data. \u201cWe are fully engaged in helping in the fight against Covid-19,\u201d said an O2 spokesperson. \u201cUsing our mobile technology, we have the potential to build models that help to predict broadly how the virus might move. This would in no way be able to identify or map individuals, and operates within strict privacy guidelines.\u201d It is understood that the possibility of UK mobile companies helping the government effort came up at a meeting of tech companies at Downing Street last week and BT and EE executives met Cabinet Office representatives on Thursday to expand on the discussions. As well as assessing the effectiveness of social distancing measures, mobile data can be used to track the movements of asymptomatic carriers of the disease, enabling authorities to more precisely focus testing on members of the community who may have been exposed. However, privacy campaigners worry that handing over such personally identifying information in large quantities crosses a line that may be hard to step back from when things return to normality. The Washington Post reported that the US government spoke to tech companies about using a \u201ctrack and trace\u201d model of surveillance, which would involve sharing highly individualised and privacy-invading data, as well as the possibility of using the same information in aggregate form. That could mean tracking whether people are abiding by social distancing advice, for instance, or mapping larger population flows between cities or neighbourhoods. Facebook was named as being involved in the talks, but in a press call on Wednesday evening, its chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, said he had heard nothing about the topic until the Post\u2019s report, and that the company would not offer up user location data even if asked. \u201cAt a high level, the answer is no,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s probably a hypothetical, because no one is asking for this.\u201d He theorised that there had been confusion with a Facebook tool that already exists, Disaster Maps, which helps share real-time information on stricken communities with response teams. In the UK, the chief medical officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, told a press conference on Tuesday that the most useful period of time for location tracking had already passed. The concept \u201cwould have been a good idea in January\u201d, he said. But Prof Jon Crowcroft, Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, said the data could yet be useful. \u201cThere could be significant benefit in having a nationally implemented app tracking not only who is getting Covid-19, but also who has recovered from infection,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cInevitably, there are caveats to producing this sort of technology, and limitations. Privacy is a big one. Any app system and accompanying database must be designed with comprehensive, user-centric privacy policies built in.\u201d The Israeli approach, which relies on technology developed for counterterrorism purposes, was approved on Tuesday morning. \u201cIsrael is a democracy and we must maintain the balance between civil rights and the public\u2019s needs,\u201d said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister. \u201cThese tools will very much assist us in locating the sick and stopping the virus from spreading.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 March 2020 because an earlier version said that \u201cEE is the largest of the UK\u2019s big mobile companies\u2019. In fact it is one of the largest of those companies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
