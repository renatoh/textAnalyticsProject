Alan Johnson tried to insist that state-funded faith schools should take a quarter of their pupils from outside their faith. As the Catholic magazine the Tablet gloated last week: \"After a showdown between Johnson and Archbishop Vincent Nichols [of Birmingham], the then education secretary backed off.\" Now Ed Balls is saying new academies should take only half their intake from their religious community, unless they replace faith schools. The Catholic church is gearing up for this new battle, the Tablet reports. \"The bishops expect Catholic schools to be able to give preference to Catholics.\" Can Balls take on an opponent that so easily defeated his predecessor? \u00b7 Meanwhile, Notebook meets a Sheffield teacher whose school has just been turned into the Park academy, sponsored by another Christian organisation, the United Learning Trust. He is leaving in disgust after having seen plans for the new building. There's to be a prayer room, much bigger than any of the classrooms. Its provisional name will be the \"reflection room\" but don't be fooled, he says, there will be no mirrors on the wall. This is the school chapel by another name. \u00b7 The oldest computer science course in the world has admitted it is desperate for able applicants. It is launching a national publicity campaign to find suitable students - also known as \"compscis\". Which department? None other than the one at Cambridge University. \u00b7 Time for the Association of Colleges' annual conference. But what a strange affair it promises to be this year. For a start, there'll be no one in charge, since the AoC hasn't managed to find anyone to be its chief executive. And next week's jamboree in Birmingham will have to be held in almost total silence because the organisers have decreed that it is to be a \"carbon zero\" event. This is an admirable aspiration, but the only way that an AoC conference is going to stop waves of hot air sizzling the upper atmosphere is if all speaking is cancelled. \u00b7 So, the quango cull we are all expecting this month is not to include the Learning and Skills Council after all. Having had its guts ripped out by Gordon Brown's decision to hand over the cash for the under-19s to local authorities, it was only a matter of time before it was put down. Staff have started to wonder whether to buy day tickets rather than weekly passes for their commutes. But one of the draft bills Labour has just published reveals that the job of making sure there are enough apprenticeships for those who want them will be the LSC's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
