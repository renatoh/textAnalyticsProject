By a narrow 5-4 decision, the court ruled against two state school districts that used pupils' race in making admissions decisions designed to promote racial diversity. By disallowing racial diversity as a legal criteria, the court dealt a blow to the court's famous Brown v Board of Education decision in 1954, that outlawed discrimination in government schools and led eventually to the dismantling of formal segregation in America's south. Yesterday's decision crushes efforts by a school district in Kentucky to fight discrimination after its classrooms had once been segregated by law. The district was supervised for 25 years by federal courts in order to achieve racial integration. The majority included Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Samuel Alito, who were appointed to the country's most powerful court by President Bush last year, confirming liberal fears that the court had taken a swing to the right. The votes of the two new judges were joined by the conservative justices, Antonia Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The crucial swing vote was provided by Anthony Kennedy, who has increasingly identified his rulings with the other four. Justice Roberts's majority opinion echoed that of Brown versus Board of Education, stating: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race.\" The formal announcement of the ruling was followed by unusual scenes in the court. While the chief justice read out the majority opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer visibly grimaced. Justice Breyer delivered the minority opinion, and included a stinging rebuke to the majority in a sign of the growing divide between liberal and conservative justices. The decision, he said, \"undermines Brown's promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality.\" \"This is a decision that the court, and the nation, will come to regret,\" he added. The court's longest serving justice, 87-year-old John Paul Stevens, appointed by President Gerald Ford in 1975, also denounced the decision in unusually pointed remarks. \"There is a cruel irony in the chief justice's reliance on our decision in Brown v Board of Education,\" said Justice Stevens. \"It is my firm conviction that no member of the court that I joined in 1975 would have agreed with today's decision,\" he wrote. The school diversity decision is the latest in a string of close decisions by the new court that have weakened or overturned the court's previous decisions. Last month, the court upheld a law banning a form of abortion known as partial birth. The court's only female judge, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, said the decision \"cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this court\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
