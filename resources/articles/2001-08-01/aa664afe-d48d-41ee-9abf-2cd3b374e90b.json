The day after agreeing a \u00a34.5m fee for the French midfielder Steed Malbranque, the Craven Cottage manager Jean Tigana spent some of his chairman Mohamed Al Fayed's millions. Tigana has been chasing a top-class goalkeeper for months and was known to be interested in Coventry City's unsettled Swede Marcus Hedman. But Van der Sar's availability persuaded Tigana to pounce. The Dutchman has been under a cloud at Juventus after their signing last month of the world's most expensive goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from Parma for a staggering \u00a333m. He was forced to train with the Juventus youth team players, a humiliation which he admitted accelerated his departure from Turin. \"I am happy and relieved to have signed for Fulham,\" he said. \"The plans that Fulham presented to me were impressive and I like the ambition the club has. I spoke with the manager and we had a good conversation about the way he wants to play. \"Jean Tigana wants to go to the top with Fulham and he proved he could do that with Monaco. I like that ambition. At Ajax, Juventus and with Holland I have played with top teams and I now want to use my experience to reach the same goal with Fulham.\" Malbranque, who is training with the first-team squad, should complete his move by the end of the week. A spokesman said: \"There is a small technical hitch but nothing which cannot be resolved.\" Meanwhile, the sports minister Richard Caborn has responded to concern about the financial implications of Manchester United's testimonial for Ryan Giggs against Celtic tonight by announcing that he wants a review into the practice of footballers earning tax-free windfalls from benefit matches. Caborn is to ask the Treasury to look into whether it is fair for players such as Giggs, a multimillionaire who has recently signed a contract worth a weekly salary of \u00a350,000, to bank around \u00a32m from his testimonial year. The committee working on behalf of Giggs responded immediately by revealing that he would donate a percentage to three charities, while the United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and the Professional Footballers' Association vigorously defended the 27-year-old's right for such a lucrative event. However, there is concern within the government that professional footballers earn so much these days that they should no longer be eligible for such lucrative benefits. \"I am going to draw it to the attention of the Treasury and ask them to review the situation,\" said Caborn. \"Times have changed and there is no reason not to review it and decide whether testimonials should continue to be tax-free or not. Are the reasons for them being tax-free still valid and, if not, should they be changed?\" Testimonials were originally introduced to reward injured or loyal players but that was in the days when footballers' earnings were much lower. Players are not taxed because the Treasury views the income as being \"informal payments\" rather than part of an official employer-employee relationship. Caborn may recommend that a pay ceiling is introduced whereby any footballer whose wages exceed a certain level will have to pay tax. Ferguson defended Giggs's benefit. \"Some people say that players don't deserve testimonials any more, but I think Ryan does,\" he said. \"He's been a terrific servant to United and he has great character.\" Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chief executive, added: \"On the one hand players are accused of being mercenaries when they walk out on a club but if they stay loyal and give 10 years' service, people still go on about them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
