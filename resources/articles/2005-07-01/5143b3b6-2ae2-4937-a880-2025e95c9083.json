The boy, who was 11 at the time, cannot be named for legal reasons. He was giving evidence at Hull crown court, where he has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and wounding. The baby suffered life-threatening injuries, but recovered after surgery. The boy said he was \"a bit mad\" because he could not complete The Incredibles game. The court heard that he was being bullied at school, he was worried about his sister and the baby kept screaming. The boy's sister, who is the baby's mother, was suffering from depression and had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act for her own safety. The baby was being cared for by the baby's grandmother, who had left him with her son while she visited a friend across the road from their home in north-east Lincolnshire last December. The boy, who is now 12, had told officers: \"I kept dying on the Playstation and that made me a bit mad. I only had a bit left to do.\" The baby, who was in the next room, began \"whingeing\". He had paused his game and walked into the kitchen and closed the door. He picked up a small kitchen knife and tried to mend a toy that had jammed. While he did so, the baby was screaming. The boy said: \"I walked to the pram and [the baby] was still crying, so without realising, I just stabbed him. The blade came out of the wooden bit. I realised what I had done, so I put it in the room underneath the telly.\" He did not know how far he pushed the knife in. He had told the police the baby's eyes went big. \"He opened them dead wide like an owl,\" he said. He got dressed and checked on the baby, before running to his mother. \"I didn't see any blood, there was just this red lump,\" he said. \"I didn't want to do anything to [the baby], but I wasn't thinking.\" The court heard that eight pupils at the school, which the boy had only attended for one term, repeatedly told him to shut up. A forensic scientist, Nicola Taylor, found fatty deposits from the baby on the knife, three to four inches from the tip, but no blood. There was no forensic evidence on the knife that the defendant had stabbed the baby, she said. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
