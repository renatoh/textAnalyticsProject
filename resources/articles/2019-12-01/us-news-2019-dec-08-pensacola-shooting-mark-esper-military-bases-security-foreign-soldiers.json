The gunman who struck in a classroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Friday morning was killed by sheriff\u2019s deputies, two of whom were among eight people wounded. All were expected to survive. No arrests had been made, the FBI agent in charge said at a press conference on Sunday, adding that all international students at the base have been accounted for. \u201cWe are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,\u201d said Rachel Rojas. \u201cThere are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation. The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation.\u201d Saudi state media has reported that the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called President Trump expressing his condolences for the families affected by the shooting. The crown prince also assured Trump that Saudi authorities would offer their absolute cooperation with the US and provide all information that would help the investigations. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said he had asked the Pentagon to review screening procedures for soldiers from other countries sent to the US for training. Key allies of Donald Trump called for Saudi Arabia to be suspended from such programs. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21. A US official told the AP investigators believe Alshamrani visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting. The FBI was attempting to question anyone who may have interacted with him, the official said. Authorities also believe the gunman made social media posts about US support for Israel and alleging Americans were anti-Muslim, the official said. Investigators were continuing to examine his online profiles and social media postings. On Saturday, a US official told the Associated Press the Saudi gunman hosted a dinner party this week where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings. The official said one of the three students who attended the party then recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting took place, while two Saudi students watched from a car. Rojas said the FBI was \u201clooking very hard at uncovering his motive and I would ask for patience so we can get this right\u201d. She added that 80 FBI special agents, 100 support staff and scores of other investigators from the navy and multiple federal agencies were working the case. Rojas said the pistol used \u2013 a Glock 9mm handgun that can be paired with a magazine holding 33 rounds \u2013 was legally purchased somewhere in Florida. According to US regulations, it is legal for a foreigner on a non-immigrant visa to buy a gun if certain conditions are met, including if they simply have a hunting license. Esper appeared on Fox News Sunday. He said he had asked top defense officials to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re taking all necessary precautions\u201d to make sure military installations are secure. The shooting was the second at a US naval base in a week. A sailor whose submarine was docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, opened fire on three civilian employees on Wednesday, killing two before killing himself. Esper also said he had asked the Pentagon to \u201creview what our screening procedures are\u201d before soldiers from other countries come to the US for training programs he said were \u201cvery important to our national security\u201d. More than 850 Saudis are in the US for training activities, among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries. \u201cThis has been done for many decades,\u201d Trump told reporters on Saturday. \u201cI guess we\u2019re going to have to look into the whole procedure. We\u2019ll start that immediately.\u201d Two leading Trump allies in Congress said Saudi Arabia should be suspended from US training programs. \u201cWe need to suspend the Saudi program until we find out what happened here,\u201d the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. Graham said he liked the idea of training foreign pilots \u201cbut there\u2019s something really bad here. We need to slow this program down and re-evaluate.\u201d Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman whose district includes the base in Pensacola, told ABC\u2019s This Week the shooting \u201chas to inform our ongoing relationship with Saudi Arabia\u201d. Saying he and Trump had been communicating regularly, he added: \u201cWe should not be taking new incoming Saudi students until we\u2019re absolutely confident in our vetting process.\u201d The navy identified the men who died and hailed them as heroes for trying to stop the gunman and flagging down first responders after being shot. Capt Tim Kinsella, commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola, said in a statement: \u201cWhen confronted, they didn\u2019t run from danger; they ran towards it and saved lives.\u201d One of the victims was a 23-year-old graduate of the US Naval Academy who alerted first responders to where the gunman was after he had been shot several times. \u201cJoshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own,\u201d his older brother, Adam Watson, wrote on Facebook. \u201cHe died a hero and we are beyond proud.\u201d Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St Petersburg, Florida, joined the navy after graduating high school last year, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Haitham\u2019s mother, Evelyn Brady, herself a navy veteran, said the commander of her son\u2019s school called her and told her Haitham had tried to stop the gunman. The former track and field star had been assigned to flight crew training and was looking forward to graduating from the program later this month, she said. \u201cHe said he was going to get his flight jacket for Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d The third victim was airman apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
