Sean Ingle\u2019s piece from Doha to follow as will live coverage of the final day of the meet on Sunday. The Team GB 4x100m silver medalist athletes have been talking to BBC TV. Adam Gemili: \u201cWe were always pushing for the gold but the Americans were better than us. We ran a new British record. We tried our best and hopefully it was a good show for the crowd. Leaving with something is great and it puts a spark in us for next year.\u201d Zharnel Hughes: \u201cI think I strained my hamstring maybe. Tonight I came out here and gave it my very best regardless. I pulled it just before I handed over the baton but I knew I had to give it to Richard regardless because I wanted the guys to get a medal. I did my best and the guys came away with a medal. I\u2019m happy, we\u2019re going back home with something around our neck. Richard Kilty: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely incredible. It took an American record, the second fastest time ever to beat us. We ran a new European record. Zharnel is a proper warrior. When I saw him flying down the straight, I heard something happen so I knew I had to slow a bit. We came out here as brothers and we\u2019re buzzing.\u201d Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake: \u201cPhenomenal effort by the guys. I\u2019m proud of the boys. It gives us fuel for the fire for next year. Let\u2019s enjoy the moment right now though.\u201d Yulimar Rojas wins the women\u2019s triple jump for Venezuela with an earlier jump of 15.37, though didn\u2019t manage to break the world record, as she attempted on her final jump. Jamaica\u2019s Shanieka Ricketts took silver with 14.92 and Colombia\u2019s Caterine Ibarguen bronze on 14.73m. It\u2019s a new European record for Great Britain but they just fell a little short in the end. Hughes looks like he has hurt his hamstring in the process. A poor second changeover for Great Britain costs them a little bit of time, as they finish second. USA win it and deservedly so. Adam Gemili, Richard Kilty, Zharnel Hughes and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake ran 37.36 seconds as they failed to defend the title won in London two years ago. The USA\u2019s team of Christian Coleman, Justin Gatlin, Michael Rodgers and Noah Lyles took the title in 37.10secs while Japan were third. Asha Philip explains Imani wasn\u2019t feeling 100% and needed replacing at the last minute. Asher-Smith gets a round of applause for her third medal of the competition. China finished in 1.05.97 after a failed change over forced them to go back and re-do it in order to make sure they finish in order to qualify for the Olympics. Jamaica lead from start to finish to win it in 41.44 with Great Britain second and USA third. A good result for Great Britain after a slightly slow start but they made up for it in the end. The 100m relays are next up, so the BBC are explaining are Great Britain are good at messing it up. Let\u2019s hope it won\u2019t end up like it this time. Weightman says: \u201cI am probably a bit frustrated. For a first global championship, to finish seventh is good, but I am left wanting more and that\u2019s the best way to leave.\u201d McColgan says: \u201cI did my best to make it a hard race for the start, so all those girls have me to thank. I wanted to run 14.40 or thereabouts, so just a couple of seconds off. We both ran PBs today, so that\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d Weightman finished in seventh in the end, while McColgan was 10th, which both will be reasonably happy with. Both look very tired after it having run personal bests in a very quick race. Obiri hears the bell and starts sprinting for the final 400m. Klosterhalfen keeps pace with her going into the final bend but then Obiri breaks her and takes the win, with Kipkemboi taking second and the German third. Six are left at the front with Obiri stretching it out with Klosterhalfen just behind. The six pretty comfortable at the front but it\u2019s no surprise considering the slowing pace. McColgan moves up to the front quickly but it\u2019s a relatively slow race until Obiri tries to force it up a little bit in the 500m final. The Brit drops back as Obiri looks to dominate at the front. The Kenyan sticks at the front for a long period and looks pretty comfortable in that position. Next up it\u2019s the 5000m women\u2019s final. Eilish McColgan and Laura Weightman are the Great British interests on the track. In the women\u2019s triple jump, Rojas goes well beyond 15m to extend her lead at the top. It\u2019s not a World Record but it\u2019s not far off at 15.37m. More madness in the shot put as Kovacs goes even further with 22.91 to first, before Crouser follows that with 22.90m just sit in joint second with Walsh. They\u2019ve all broken what was the Championship record before tonight. Kovacs is the one to take gold, though. Oh ... Laura Muir says: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, I finished fifth with 3.55. But to run 3.55 when I missed so much training, I am speechless but I am so, so proud of myself. \u201cI am so happy to run 3.55 and no way in the world I would have thought I\u2019d finish fifth.\u201d Muir does seem impressively happy about the whole thing. She also then thanks everyone she\u2019s ever met. What a quick final! So many PBs and national records broken there with little to show for it thanks to Hassan\u2019s speed at the front. The top seven have broken a record in that. Muir gets herself to the back very quickly, just where she wants to be. Realising the danger at the front, Muir kicks a little earlier than expected to move up the field. Hassan leads for the first two lap and is doing it at a decent speed - the second lap was just 62 seconds. Muir gets right up to the front midway through the third lap, ending it in second as the bell rings. Hassan works to get away from Muir and the Brit can\u2019t compete, dropping back to third and needing a lot of effort to stay there. Hassan goes clear and Muir is nowhere to be seen in fifth. Muir just could not compete with the pace. Hassan wins it in 3.51.95 to earn a Championship record, while Kipyegon and Tsegay take second and third, respectively. Laura Muir is up next in the 1500m final. Can she do it? Michael Johnson says it\u2019s \u201cshocking\u201d that Martyn Rooney is still in the 4x400m relay team. And he\u2019s quite right and even Rooney knows it. Outside the stadium ... Not a classic lineup for the second 4x400m heat. Jamaica get the lead, while South Africa, France and Belgium make up the rest of the battle at the end of the second. There\u2019s a scrap for third and fourth is pretty hardcore, it ends with Jamaica, Belgium and Trinidad and Tobago getting the automatic spots, while France\u2019s time in fourth knows out Great Britain. Another goes beyond 22m in the shot put - Romani goes into second with 22.53m. What a start to the competition. Martyn Rooney says: \u201cI let them [the team] down again, it\u2019s a habit that I don\u2019t like, particularly Lee [Thompson] who works full-time and has taken time off to come out here.\u201d Rooney adds it was his fault as he failed to commit to a plan in the final leg. Great Britain\u2019s hopes are hanging by a thread, knowing they could still be the second best loser but it\u2019s going to be tight. The first leg sees Colombia start incredibly well in the outside lane but USA just edge it. Yousif for Great Britain needs to go round everyone to get to the front and hands over Thompson. At the end of the second leg, USA are left in four, which they are not used to. London for USA is not messing about and speeds past the entire field to lead at the end. Rooney takes the baton for Great Britain, sitting on the shoulder of the Japanese athlete but his thinking is confused and he does not attack it. USA win it, Colombia second, Italy third, Botswana fourth and Great Britain fifth. That\u2019s a poor final leg for Rooney. We have the the men\u2019s 4x400m relays next up. Heat one will include Great Britain. In the meantime Tom Walsh produces the the throw of his life in the shot put with 22.90m - a new PB and Championship record. Michael Johnson points out that Jamaica and USA will be battling it out for gold, while Great Britain have a sniff of a medal alongside Ukraine and Poland. Belgium, despite missing out on third in the second heat do qualify for the final thanks to their time. Only six teams in the second 4x400m heat due to Botswana not starting. Italy and Switzerland finish the first leg in very good positions. Williams gets moving well on the second leg for Great Britain to get the team back into it. Felix opens up a great gap at the front for USA at the end of the second leg. The USA continue this with Turner not too far behind when the third leg concludes. USA bring it home with Great Britain behind and the final qualifier is Ukraine .... just about. It\u2019s a photo finish! Great Britain came home with a season best, so they cannot complain with that. Ryan Crouser gets a Championship record in the shot put with 22.36m. Not a bad start in the first round for the American. Salazar is dominating a lot of the chat in Doha. Sean Ingle has the latest ... Abigail Irozuru and Chanice Porter will both be representing Great Britain in the long jump final on Sunday after some fine jumping on Saturday. McGregor gets Jamaica in a good position in the first leg, putting them in a commanding lead with Canada and France also running well. The second leg ends with things looking tight but Jamaica just have the edge still but Canada really making some impressive moves. It looks going into the anchor left that the two four are set with Jamaica and Poland at the front. McPherson moves clear for Jamaica with a 50.1 seconds final leg while Poland and Canada complete the top three to qualify. The athletes are in place for the first heat of the women\u2019s 4x400m relay. Great Britain are in the second heat. Mutaz Essa Barshim has collected his gold medal for winning the high jump and celebrates with his trademark bird impression. The camera is managing to pick out the few spectators in the stadium. Laura Muir is, needless to say, looking to win in Doha. If she does get gold she will be the third British woman to win in Qatar following Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson. \u201cIt would be great to get three from three,\u201d she said in Doha. \u201cThat is not to discount any other athletes. \u201cI know Dina, KJT and myself have been figureheads for this team in the media and I would love to get that medal. \u201cDina has got two and Kat has one and if we get a few more on the table that would be fantastic.\u201d Welcome to another night of action in Doha. We\u2019ll have the relay heats, while Eilish McColgan and Laura Weightman are both in action in the 5000m final. Hopefully there will be someone there to watch it all, too. Laura Muir will also be in the mix for the 1500m final. Great Britain will certainly be hoping by the end of the night they will have added to their three medals in the competition so far. Here\u2019s something to get you in the mood for the Marathon, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
