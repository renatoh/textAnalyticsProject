Ben\u00edtez, now in charge of Newcastle United, replaced Roberto Di Matteo in November 2012 and won the Europa League while finishing third in the Premier League. He would have been happy to continue and enjoyed some strong support within the club but believes the actions of a minority of fans persuaded the owner, Roman Abramovich, to replace him with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. \u201cThe normal fans, the ones you can find on the streets, were OK with me,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cThe majority of people realised I was doing a professional job and were happy. On a daily basis the atmosphere was very positive but maybe some fans, because of my past with Liverpool, were unhappy.\u201d Those dissenters proved sufficiently vocal to derail any plans Chelsea\u2019s hierarchy might have harboured about potentially retaining Ben\u00edtez in post over the longer term. He believes \u201cfake news\u201d played a part in manufacturing what turned into a campaign to ensure that, despite \u201csaving\u201d Chelsea\u2019s season, he would not remain in the dugout for long. \u201cA teenager in the Czech Republic put on Twitter that I once said I would never manage Chelsea,\u201d said the Champions League-winning former Liverpool manager. \u201cThat is simply not true yet this story was created. But I\u2019m telling you, the fans in the street at the end, they were saying: \u2018Carry on, you\u2019re doing a great job.\u2019 \u201cAll the feedback that I had from the professionals and the board was very positive. We achieved what they wanted. But they couldn\u2019t manage what happened with some fans. In the end, they decided they had to change. \u201cInitially, Abramovich brought me in to save the team. We achieved that and my relationship with him [Abramovich] was really good but a group of fans weren\u2019t good to me. It doesn\u2019t mean they were the majority though; I can tell you a lot of fans were happy with me. At the end, I had a lot of messages telling me I did really well.\u201d Antonio Conte may not be doing quite as well as last season at Chelsea but his Newcastle counterpart refuses to completely write off the Italian\u2019s chances of retaining the title. Although the London club, who are third, trail Manchester City, the leaders, by 11 points Ben\u00edtez is not entirely sure if things will remain quite as straightforward as they seem. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Chelsea are out of the title race,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do know they are a very strong team who will be closer at the top of the table. They can win a lot of games. \u201cI know Conte because I\u2019ve competed against him in Italy and we\u2019ve taken coaching courses together. He\u2019s a very competitive manager who has done a great job at Chelsea. He\u2019s a winner, he\u2019s someone who is always pushing his team to win trophies.\u201d For the moment, Ben\u00edtez will simply be content if Newcastle win a few games. Tuesday\u2019s 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion arrested a run of four successive defeats but their manager has warned that a relegation skirmish could lie in store should he be unable to strengthen his squad in January. Much hinges on whether Amanda Staveley\u2019s mooted takeover succeeds. Although negotiations continue between Staveley\u2019s Dubai-based PCP Capital Partners and Newcastle\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, time is running out for a handover to be completed before next month\u2019s transfer window."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
