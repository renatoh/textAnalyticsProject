Akermanis, a Brownlow medallist whose career has been similarly overshadowed by controversy, preceded the interview by addressing readers directly, saying: \u201cBefore you start the same [negative] comments about myself or \u2018Shawry\u2019 just let it be known if we don\u2019t know you, we don\u2019t care what you think\u201d. Shaw used his platform in the New Daily to again deny he made demands of the premier, Denis Napthine, to make a judicial appointment, and confirmed that regardless of Tuesday\u2019s result, he would contest the next state election, scheduled for November. Last week Shaw declared he had lost trust in the Napthine government and would back any move by the opposition to pass a no-confidence motion, a measure which the opposition leader, Daniel Andrews, appeared to reject. Shaw seemed to walk back his sensational threat in the interview, saying, \u201cJust because you lose confidence in your team doesn\u2019t mean you want them to be defeated.\u201d Declaring he has done \u201cthe best any politician ever has for Frankston\u201d, the Frankston MP attacked the \u201cmoral cowards\u201d in the government for refusing to change Victoria\u2019s abortion laws, a signature issue for Shaw, a Christian. He also rounded on the media, saying: \u201cMany people have told my office about ringing up talkback radio but when they find out the caller supports me they are not allowed on. Also with letters to the editor. Good news Geoff Shaw stories are drowned out by the media\u2019s bias and agenda.\u201d Shaw is facing expulsion from parliament on Tuesday if Andrews succeeds in having Shaw found in contempt of parliament for misusing his parliamentary vehicle and fuel cards. Shaw maintained his innocence in the interview, telling Akermanis the rules he had broken were \u201cjust guidelines, not regulations or laws\u201d. \u201cI complied with the guidelines but as the ombudsman pointed out, the guidelines were ambiguous. They have now been changed. Doesn\u2019t that say a lot?\u201d Shaw said. Shaw was ordered to pay back nearly $7,000 after a privileges committee ruled he had contravened the MPs\u2019 code of conduct by using the car for his private hardware business. But the Coalition-dominated committee decided he had not \u201cwilfully\u201d broken the MPs\u2019 conduct of conduct, sparing Shaw a contempt finding, which could lead to his expulsion or suspension from the chamber. The Coalition government depends on Shaw, a former Liberal, to pass legislation. Labor will seek to have parliament adopt its minority report, which found Shaw in contempt. It will require a separate vote to have the Frankston MP expelled. Both outcomes depend on the former Liberal speaker Ken Smith, a bitter enemy of Shaw\u2019s, who has indicated he would support Labor in having Shaw punished. It is unclear whether Smith will follow through, however, because Shaw\u2019s expulsion would leave parliament deadlocked and could trigger a byelection, potentially bringing down Napthine\u2019s government. Shaw said on Tuesday his expulsion would be a \u201ctravesty\u201d. \"I think the treasurer [of Victoria, Michael O'Brien] said it well \u2013 this is Parliament of Victoria, not the big brother house. You don\u2019t expel someone because you don\u2019t like them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
