While Worcester secured their Premiership survival with this win, what the future holds for Saracens is far more opaque. No one is quite sure what the South African consortium which co-owns the club has in mind, but Graham insists the departure of Eddie Jones amid talk of the Vicarage Road club becoming a feeder team for the group's other interests \u2013 the Super 14 sides the Blue Bulls and the Stormers \u2013 is no excuse for such a chastening reversal. \"I think we've put that behind us, obviously six weeks ago with the club's announcement, and then two or three weeks ago with Eddie; we know where we stand as a group. This is what we've got until the end of the season and I'd like to think from my point of view that it is done and dusted and we've got a seven-game season,\" said Graham, adding that his players could not use the behind-the-scenes turmoil as an excuse. \"They're paid to turn up and train and perform, and they do that every second week at the moment,\" he continued, referring to Saracens' poor performances away from home. European qualification is still not beyond the realms of possibility for Saracens, who so impressively dispatched Wasps the previous weekend, but Graham knows days like these need to be exorcised from the memory. \"We will probably just put that one behind us. We came here obviously with high expectations on the back of that performance last week, but we've followed the same path we have for the last three away games, very lacklustre. \"We've got a lot to play for, we've got that sixth spot that we felt was still up for grabs, or seventh spot obviously we want to secure, just in case the Heineken Cup places go to seventh. But we haven't done ourselves any justice. We're proud, competitive people, but that was poor.\" Alex Grove scored Worcester's try, the outside centre providing the fleet-footed finish to a swift second-half attack. David Seymour crossed on the narrow side after a well-worked lineout for Saracens, but it was too little too late and Mike Ruddock could reflect on a job well done by the hosts. \"It wasn't the perfect performance, but it was much, much better than the last two games for us,\" said the Warriors' director of rugby.
