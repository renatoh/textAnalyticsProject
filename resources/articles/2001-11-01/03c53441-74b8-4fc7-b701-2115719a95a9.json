Bruised and battered after Lazio, still stagnating in the relegation zone, crashed out of Europe last week, promptly dropped Gaizka Mendieta, Claudio Lopez and Stefano Fiore - total value \u00a360m - for the visit of Brescia. The result? A 5-0 win which lifted the Hernan Crespo inspired Romans out of the bottom three, but failed to win round supporters still seething over the sales of Marcelo Salas, Juan Sebastian Veron and Pavel Nedved. \"I understand the public, but they can keep protesting if every time we win 5-0?\" asked general manager Massimo Cragnotti. \"I have seen fighting spirit, determination and everything we've been waiting for for a while.\" For his part Zaccheroni remained defiant. \"It doesn't upset me to leave out players who cost the club so much money,\" he said. \"But it hurt me to go out of Europe and I had to make changes.\" The serie A scalp of the week belongs not to Pierluigi Collina, for once, but to Torino, shock victors over Milan - albeit with a little help from Pippo Inzaghi. Milan had a disastrous first half, offering little threat up front and showing their usual vulnerability at the back, allowing Cristiano Lucarelli to turn in a cross from man-of-the-match Antonino Asta. Although the rossoneri improved after the half-time introduction of Marco Simone, Torino held on, even after conceding a late penalty: not-so-Super Pippo did a Marcelo Salas on the spot-kick, sending it into the stratosphere. Silvio Berlusconi may yet launch Fatih Terim after it. \"If we had played the first half the way we did the second, we would have certainly come away with something,\" ranted the Emperor, who refused to comment on the penalty miss. \"But I am not afraid [of the sack], this is football. It is impossible to win every time.\" Surprises at Venezia too, inasmuch as Chievo's visit saw top and bottom sides meet, rather than the relegation clash predicted pre-season. Unusually, the flying donkeys sailed away with just a point for only the second time in this campaign. Other Serie A sides take note: Venezia closed down Simone Perrotta and playmaker Eugenio Corini, giving themselves some space to work and threatening through main man Pippo Manieri. With twenty minutes to go, Luigi Del Neri swapped Federico Cossatto for Massimo Marazzina and Chievo livened up, but outstanding goalkeeping from Generoso Rossi kept Venezia afloat until the end. Although Chievo stay top, Del Neri talked - you've guessed it - of relegation. \"We must continue to keep our eyes on the relegation zone,\" he intoned. \"It would be presumptious to talk about winning the championship. We hope to stay high in the table for a long time, but our aim is to stay up.\" Ronaldo might be best advised to have similarly modest objectives. Appearing from the start for the first time in two years, the Brazilian limped off with a thigh strain just 13 minutes into Inter's 2-0 win over Lecce. Although all Il Fenomeno's comebacks so far this season have been curtailed by similar muscular problems, he remained calm. \"I am paying for the fact that I have not played a proper football match in two years,\" he explained to the fans. \"I just felt this pulling on the back of my thigh and the doctors decided to let me rest as a precautionary measure. I have not lost my enthusiasm, nor my motivation.\" Inter didn't appear unduly inconvenienced by his early exit. Goals from Mohammed Kallon and Luigi Di Biagio, both teed up by Czech international Vratislav Gresko's perfectly-positioned crosses, send the nerazzuri back into second place. Juventus needed a stoppage-time David Trezeguet equalizer at Verona whilst managerless Parma's win may unseat Perugia's Serse Cosmi. A week without managerial casualties - now that really would be a shocker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
