Although, for those who believe that September 11 altered everything, this was merely my second journey to the new America and so it was inevitable to reflect on what has changed. The biggest transformation comes before arrival and after departure. By the 89th and 90th flights, crossing the Atlantic should have become routine but, since 9/11, we've all become as tremblingly pioneering as the passengers on the first airships. And more so this week because the free papers handed out in the cabins as distractions were filled with warnings from Tony Blair and George Bush about the increased threat of another strike from al-Qaida. It has long been aviation practice to edit out plane crash scenes from in-flight movies and it might now be sensible to take scissors to the newspapers as well. Particularly as, on this occasion, something went wrong with the plane. As we waited on the Tarmac, at the moment when the 747 switches over from the power supply on the ground to its own, all the cabin's lights went out and the entertainment screens failed, leaving only the exit signs and glowing crossed-cigarette logos to illuminate our nervous faces. We sat in the dark while engineers were brought on board. The only change in the next half-hour was that the no-smoking signs occasionally went out as well. Then the captain came on the Tannoy with that special soft baritone they give to people such as pilots and doctors who may have to give bad news. \"As you can tell, ladies and gentlemen, there's a problem,\" he explained, the distortion making him sound like the one Dalek they sent to charm school. \"Well, two actually. The first is that the displays show that everything's fine. But, as you can see, we're having trouble powering up parts of the aircraft. And we need to find out why.\" Perhaps if I had never read that article in a news magazine last year - warning that terrorists are believed to be working on devices which interfere with a jet's electrical systems - the captain might have achieved the calming effect he intended. All frequent flyers have tried, in their imaginations, to place themselves on a plane which is going down. With a bomb, there would only be a moment of knowing. The September 11 passengers had time to phone home. How can we say which is better or worse? But, on this occasion, we had been given a bigger range of options by what might turn out to be fate: there was a chance of getting off the flight and taking a later one. The lights and screens came on again. I'm convinced that, even a couple of years ago, there would have been ironic applause, but perhaps the times are now too serious for that. The cabin crew explained that nobody knew what had been wrong or how it had been corrected, but that the jet was behaving again. In a thriller, of course, the suicide bomber in row 57 would have realised that he'd accidentally activated the interference device too early and quickly switched it off until we got airborne. To my surprise, no one tried to leave the flight while we still had the chance. My own reason was the fear of social embarrassment - that someone trying to get off would be taken for either a coward or a terrorist - which demonstrates that, in certain circumstances, English manners might be fatal. Maybe, because the passengers were mainly English, there was also a tribal memory of resisting the Blitz and the IRA. It was also some comfort to me to know, from many reports of air crashes, that jets are required to have several independent electrical systems. A cabin light and an engine aren't on the same plug. And so, as the appearance of this article shows, the plane took off, troubled only by turbulence from the English winter gales, and all our lights stayed on. But there are certain events which take a rare phobia and make it common. Most soldiers in the trenches became terrified of rats; all of us are nervous flyers now. If the process of getting to and from America has changed, however, the experience of being there strangely hasn't. Only a year ago, it had seemed to me that it would never be possible again to walk down Fifth Avenue without nervously inspecting the sky for hijacked jets. Now, even with the director of homeland security waving red flags almost daily, you didn't think about it. Manhattan had what Americans call normalcy. On my favourite US television programme - NBC's Today show - the peaktime segment consisted of the previously obese weather forecaster, Al Roker, introducing a video of the stomach-stapling operation which has allowed him to shed a third of his 320 pounds. This was the culture I'd marvelled at on the first of those 45 visits. Whatever happens to British TV, you simply can't imagine watching film of Michael Fish's intestinal surgery. The same America. But, under all this, there's a shadow which we only glimpse when, for example, something strange happens on a plane and we think about the lights going out. Osama bin Laden travels by horseback, but he's managed to make us terrified of the horsepower on which our working lives depend. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
