Without doubt, the Lions are in their best form of the season going into the franchise's first appearance in a major final. It took 13 years of trying to get beyond the first round, and seven wins in their last eight games - the one defeat in overtime - have made the club cautiously optimistic that fate is on its side. \"We've got the second-best chance of anyone in the league,\" said their player-coach Nigel Lloyd. \"But it's unfamiliar territory for all of us, and we're fooling ourselves if we think we can just walk in there and take the prize.\" Chester have the BBL's best record and, having already won the National Cup, are looking to secure the second leg of what would be the BBL's first clean sweep since 1992. What makes Milton Keynes such difficult opponents is their naturalised American Jason Siemon and the Barbadian international Andrew Alleyne, a big man pairing that could trouble Chester close to the basket. \"We've played them twice and it's not been that physical,\" said Siemon, now in his ninth season in this country with only a cup-winner's medal and an appearance on the quirky Channel 4 betting show Banzai to show for it. \"They're a run and gun team, they don't really like to have to play half-court basketball,\" he said. \"We're peaking at the right time and we're on a rush right now. We weren't consistent in the first half of the season - we didn't close out games the way we should have done.\" Lloyd agrees that the Lions' dodgy mid-season form, which threatens to cost them a play-off spot in the tough Southern Conference, is no guide to today's final. Their high-scoring guard Jermaine Brown, signed from Leicester in January, has had a greater impact than the 22 points per game he averages, says Lloyd. \"He's brought a willingness to compete that we didn't have before,\" says Lloyd. Siemon talks of Brown as \"a spark plug; a flat-out scorer\". The Lions are said to be taking 2,000 fans, who have certainly had plenty of time to save up for it, to the final. At a time when others are trying to transplant a football team into the city, the Lions are showing that a sporting culture mayalready exist among the concrete cows. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
