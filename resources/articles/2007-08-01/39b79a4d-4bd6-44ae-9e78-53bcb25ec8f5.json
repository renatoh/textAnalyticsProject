He is best known for the ramshackle installation he built at Chelsea School Of Art that the public was invited to dismantle at the end of the exhibition. Hudson's tattered sculptures allude to the makeshift communities that form in big cities. Traffic cones, plastic bags, cardboard and MDF all feature, hacked into towers of teetering rubbish. Lately the artist has been building another of these flawed creations, once again transforming cheap tat into a sprawling, magical world. Jessica Lack \u00b7 Rokeby, WC1, Tue 28 to Oct 2 Iceland Bury Iceland comes to Bury in the form of art from the Safn in Reykjavik which houses the impressive collection of Petur Arason and Ragna Robertsdottir. Work by international artists - some Icelandic, mostly of a minimalist or conceptualist bent - includes Carl Andre's Icelandic basalt slabs, Tacita Dean's etchings The Russian Ending, Lawrence Weiner's text sculpture The Light Of Day &amp; Iceland Spar and Birgir Snebjorn Birgisson's chilling figurines of doctors and nurses. Richard Long presents volcanic boulders. The one work not from Safn is a special commission by Helmet Lemke based on one hell of a continuous 37-hour storm near Vik. Robert Clark \u00b7 Bury Art Gallery, to Nov 3 Eeva-Mari Haikala Exeter Eeva-Mari Haikala's dreamy 16mm film is inspired by the works of Pierre Bonnard, the French artist who spent much of his career painting his infirm wife in bed and in the bath. Seduced by the intimacy of his paintings, Haikala creates her own version, filming a woman on a bed. It's a strangely hypnotic work, and with photographs and videos that also focus on privacy, the viewer becomes an interloper into a melancholic world full of quiet contemplation and hallucinatory images. JL \u00b7 Spacex, Sat 25 to Sep 22 William Blake Edinburgh Has there ever been an artist like William Blake? Such a multitalented, self-mythologising rebel, such a self-publishing, sexually liberating Christian, such an impossible artist to pin down or put down? Blake wasn't as lyrically seductive a poet as Keats, as far ranging in political rage as Shelley, as convincingly crazy in visionary insight as Swinburne, nor was he ever as good a painter as Turner. He was a working class Londoner. Professionally, he was a loser. Yet, for so many, including subsequent artists and poets, he has been more of an influence than any of his Romantic contemporaries - and it's 250 years since he was born. This show of prints celebrates an artist/writer whose world view, like Van Gogh's, one can become entranced by. RC \u00b7 National Gallery Of Scotland, to Nov 4 Walker Evans London Walker Evans was one of America's most prolific photographers. Born in Missouri in 1903, he began taking photographs in the 1930s and quickly became one of the prominent members of the Farm Security Administration - photographers employed by Roosevelt's government to document the lives of people during the 1930s US Depression. This exhibition features portraits of people in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina and the countryside, belying this artist's fascination for everyday life. JL \u00b7 PM Gallery, W5, to Sep 9 Georges Hugnet Edinburgh Perhaps it was down to poet, collage artist, publisher and bookbinder Georges Hugnet spending his childhood years in Argentina that he turned into a surrealist who could be sexy. From early on he displayed the surrealist penchant for rebellious pranks, breaking into a foxtrot during a religious service at his Saint-Malo college. On settling in Paris he was befriended by Picasso and Cocteau. As a publisher and binder he championed innovative giants such as the dadaist Tristan Tzara and Gertrude Stein. As was the done thing, he joined the surrealists, then was excommunicated by the self-appointed surrealist pope, Andr\u00e9 Breton. Here we see collaborations with the likes of Duchamp alongside his seductive collages. RC \u00b7 Dean Gallery, to Sep 23 O Dreamland Greatstone-on-Sea, Folkestone Genteel boarding houses rotting from damp, empty dancehalls and concrete boardwalks plagued with weeds - the faded grandeur of Britain's coastal towns has been a popular motif for the artist. O Dreamland is an artistic celebration of that battered beauty of the seaside. The title is taken from Lindsay Anderson's 1950s documentary about Margate's Dreamland pleasure park that pitched happy daytrippers into the glorious tat of a typical amusement park. Curated by the excellent Cathy Lomax of the London-based Transition gallery, which also publishes the cultural trash mag Garageland, it features 20 artists, including Matthew Rowes, Cathy Lomax and Lucy Harrison, who revel in the delights of England's pebbled beaches. JL \u00b7 Sea Beach House, Greatstone-on-Sea/B&amp;B Project Space, Folkestone, Sat 25 to Mon 27 Francesca Woodman &amp; Richard Serra Edinburgh There's something tragically angelic about Francesca Woodman's photographs. They are beyond the pale, painfully fragile yet reaching out to some impossible beyond. In her short life, which ended when she threw herself from her New York studio window at the age of just 22, Woodman built up a body of work of quite exceptional character and exquisite aesthetic grace. Time and again the vulnerability of her body is set against the enduring power of the landscape and the coldness of the urban environment. In the latest of their wonderful series of imaginative artistic pairings, the Ingleby sets Woodman's photographs against sculptor Richard Serra's film, Hand Catching Lead, an attempt to grasp the ungraspable and film failure. Only after the show was planned did the gallery discover that Serra was a visitor to the Woodman household during the photographer's youth. Sad then, but wonderfully so.
