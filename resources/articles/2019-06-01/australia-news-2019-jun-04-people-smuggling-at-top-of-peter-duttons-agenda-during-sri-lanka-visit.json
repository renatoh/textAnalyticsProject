But Labor\u2019s new home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, has questioned why the Coalition halted aerial patrols of Australia\u2019s borders, before resuming them in February. Dutton is due to meet Sri Lanka\u2019s president Maithripala Sirisena, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his ministerial counterpart in Colombo on Tuesday. \u201cThe purpose of the visit is to prosecute Operation Sovereign Borders\u2019 interests and to engage Sri Lankan authorities on counter-terrorism matters,\u201d Dutton\u2019s spokeswoman told News Corp Australia. \u201cWe greatly value the ongoing cooperation on regional maritime security.\u201d Last week a boat carrying 20 Sri Lankan asylum seekers was intercepted off Australia. Dutton has said the boat left in early May and claimed the voyage was a test of \u201cwhat people thought was going to be a Labor administration\u201d. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has rejected the claim, noting that 10 asylum seekers boats had come from Sri Lanka on the Coalition\u2019s watch and suggesting the terrorist attacks at Easter may have prompted the boat. The asylum seekers were returned by plane to Sri Lanka via Christmas Island, although Dutton has denied they were detained there. On Tuesday Keneally seized on a report in the Australian which suggested Border Force had resumed aerial surveillance after a \u201clengthy hiatus\u201d. \u201cMr Dutton needs to explain why he stopped these crucial border patrols,\u201d Keneally wrote on Twitter. Dutton, who arrived in Sri Lanka on Monday for a two-day visit, laid a wreath at the altar of St Sebastian\u2019s church, one of the three churches and three hotels hit in the Easter Sunday suicide bombings on 21 April. The attacks left 257 dead, 113 of them at St Sebastian\u2019s. Dutton said Australia would also help Sri Lanka rebuild after the attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re here to continue to provide support as Sri Lanka rebuilds, particularly its tourism market, but the economy otherwise off the back of these horrific attacks,\u201d he said. Dutton said Australia and Sri Lanka shared \u201ca very special bond\u201d and passed on condolences for the attacks on behalf of the Australian government. \u201cAll of us condemn any act of violence, regardless of the perpetrators\u2019 religions, regardless of their background. \u201cTo commit an evil act, particularly in a place of worship \u2013 that has a special level of indecency about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
