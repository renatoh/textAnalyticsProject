Milan went on to the final to meet Liverpool in Istanbul and that is a possible scenario for Athens, Milan having eased past a disappointing Bayern Munich last night. First-half goals from Clarence Seedorf and Filippo Inzaghi set up a semi-final against United that begins at Old Trafford on Tuesday week. Sir Alex Ferguson departed Bayern's vast arena with much to ponder. Milan showed sufficient weakness in the first leg to draw 2-2 but here they were clinical in both attack and defence. Though it was a difficult game to read due to Bayern's mediocrity, what can be said with confidence is that no Italian side will fancy meeting United after the walloping inflicted on Roma on Tuesday night. Bayern had not lost at home in Europe for 11 matches, stretching back three years, but they were pedestrian - or made to look that way - as Carlo Ancelotti's side soaked up pressure, hit them on the break, then soaked up some more pressure. There will be chatter in the coming days about Milan's age but Paolo Maldini's 38- year-old legs will not have been aching after a game that was a bit too comfortable for a finely poised quarter-final second leg. There were no heroics from Daniel van Buyten this time and the former Manchester City player will not have his derby. Van Buyten scored twice in the last 12 minutes in Milan to equalise twice and to give the Germans serious optimism about progress. But Van Buyten was also involved in two goals last night and while he was not solely to blame, he was as uninspired as anyone. As for Owen Hargreaves, Bayern's president, Franz Beckenbauer, said on television before kick-off that he would contemplate selling the England midfielder \"for \u00a325m\". Hargreaves was excellent in Milan but he laboured with his colleagues here and that valuation is exorbitant on this evidence. Of course Hargreaves and Bayern can play much better - they knocked out Real Madrid to get this far. But aside from a couple of early chances Ottmar Hitzfeld's side never worked up the necessary head of steam that would invigorate the 66,000 present to intimidate Milan. Had the first 12 minutes been different, then the game would have been. Mark van Bommel had missed the first leg due to suspension but made his returning presence felt with a smart eighth-minute cross that bypassed Maldini and Alessandro Nesta and picked out Lukas Podolski. Podolski was coming in at pace and could only stab the ball goalwards but it was beating Dida until Massimo Oddo cleared it a yard from the line. Soon after that a lovely reverse pass from Roy Makaay found Podolski unmarked on the 18-yard line. Podolski edged one stride forward before spiking a shot that was fierce but too close to Dida. Milan had dug in. Midfield sparring followed but that was terminated by Kaka. On 27 minutes the Brazilian cut inside from the right and ran smoothly until supplying Seedorf. The experienced Dutchman jinked away from Lucio before shooting through the legs of Van Buyten and into the bottom corner. It was a poor goal defensively. Oliver Kahn was nowhere, a sensation he was to know again less than five minutes later. Neat passing from Marek Jankulowski and Kaka was followed by a creator's backheel from Seedorf that exposed Van Buyten. Inzaghi was suddenly free and bearing down on the ageing Kahn. Inzaghi is no spring chicken either but his finish -high into the net - was sprightly. The rest of the game passed with too little incident to satisfy the paying customer, though Ancelotti felt compelled to run on to the pitch to break up a scuffle involving Massimo Ambrosini. It is hard to believe United v Milan will be quite so tame."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
