The sport's nascent \"Racing for Change\" strategy, according to Johnston, has not got \"any hope in hell\" of succeeding. Why? Because \"we have got into a situation where we can't talk about racing without talking about betting, and I think that's a desperate mistake.\" Unfortunately for Johnston, to get to his quotes it was necessary to pass the spread on pages four and five. This followed up a weekend report that Betfair is preparing for a \u00a31.5bn flotation, which would net its founders, Ed Wray and Andrew Black, about \u00a3350m each. The major headline suggested Betfair is \"ready to crack\" the United States. In the context of a gambling business that has gone from start-up to potential 10-figure float material in barely a decade, the suggestion that betting could be anything other than integral to racing's future is patently ridiculous. And that's before you consider that racing, and UK racing in particular, has always been at the very core of Betfair's growth. Yet Johnston was simply articulating a view that is widely shared not only by many trainers and owners, but also by plenty of racing's senior administrators, too. It is an attitude born partly of snobbery, a stubborn refusal to accept that they might owe either their fun or their living to people they would normally cross the road to avoid. But more than that, it is down to a very human inability to see beyond the end of their own driveway. To be fair to many of the bigger owners in particular, the end of the drive is probably a 10-minute car ride away. And if all the people that you know and mix with take a similar view, it is easy to believe that everything would be OK if only everybody else was the same. It is true that there are examples of racing set-ups \u2013 you can hardly call them industries \u2013 that exist almost independently from betting. Jump racing in America, for instance, in which a few like-minded souls indulge their passion for the sake of the sport alone. But could a structure like that ever keep Johnston \u2013 who grosses at least \u00a372,000 per week in training fees alone according to the Directory of the Turf \u2013 in the manner to which he is accustomed? Whether they like it or not \u2013 and many of them do not like it one bit \u2013 the future health of the racing industry comes back to betting. This does not mean \"selling out\" to the bookmakers. In fact, a frank admission of the importance of betting to racing might give the sport more confidence in the future. It might, for instance, give its administrators the will and determination to defend its position as the finest betting medium around, and lobby for the crack cocaine of FOBTs to be banished to the casinos where they belong. And while the marketing agencies imagine an army of \"Bens\" driving the \"Brians\" from our tracks, is Ben ever likely to go racing more than twice a year? Recruit a new punter, though, and they may well bet once a week, if not every day. There is also much more scope for converting them into racegoers, too, particularly if you catch them young. If people can be introduced to betting on racing as soon as they reach the legal age, almost as a rite of passage, there is a much greater chance that they will catch the bug for life. But to think like that, you have to believe that betting is important in the first place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
