He arched his back, let out a cry and threw himself to the ground, creating the impression that the Schalke 04 keeper Ralf F\u00e4hrmann, who had actually done well to pull out of the challenge, had brought him down. The referee Sebastian Dankert fell for the phantom foul and awarded a penalty. The irate F\u00e4hrmann was booked. Werner himself stepped up to slot home the spot kick coolly to put RB Leipzig 1-0 ahead. They eventually won 2-1 to stay both unbeaten and top, as well as firmly at the bottom of the popularity ratings. Werner\u2019s tumble wasn\u2019t quite the worst dive in the history of the Bundesliga \u2013 Andy M\u00f6ller still rules supreme in that respect \u2013 but it caused a stir unlike any other act of simulation in recent years. This being Germany, much of the discontent was playing out at meta-level, in complaints about the complaints. Wouldn\u2019t all this public anger (\u201cDer Falsch-Flieger\u201d, the false flier, Bild called the winger) have been better directed at the (alleged) tax fiddling by football superstars, as exposed by Der Spiegel and others, rather than at a minor sporting misdemeanour by a 20-year-old, 21 seconds into a game, some observers wondered. The answer is probably yes. But then again, the highly complex schemes concocted by accountants in Spain and Portugal might yet turn out to have been perfectly legal. On top of that, financial engineering of the morally dubious kind is necessarily a far more abstract, less exciting form of misconduct than making a fool of the referee and opposing players by feigning contact in the box, especially if it\u2019s done in a manner so blatant that one of the victims feared his elevated stress levels would cause blisters. \u201cI have to be careful not get herpes tomorrow, I\u2019m so upset,\u201d F\u00e4hrmann cried out. Strictly speaking, F\u00e4hrmann was more enraged by referee Dankert than Werner, as the official\u2019s decision to point to the spot was only one half of the controversy. A contrite Werner, F\u00e4hrmann revealed, had quickly confessed to the Schalke keeper that he hadn\u2019t touched him. \u201cHe also told the referee, too,\u201d F\u00e4hrmann alleged. Dankert denied that version of events, however. Speaking to the media after the final whistle, the official said that he had asked Werner about the foul but not received any answer. Maybe Werner had secretly hoped that Dankert had overheard his conversation with F\u00e4hrmann. He could not quite muster the courage to admit to his dive directly to the referee nor did he realise in the heat of the moment that he had yet another chance to right the wrong: by shooting the penalty straight into touch, for example. Matters were further complicated by a slight tug of Werner\u2019s arm by the Schalke defender Naldo in the run-up to the fall. In the aftermath of the final whistle, Werner at first insisted that he hadn\u2019t in fact dived, but rather reacted a little late to the earlier foul from Naldo. \u201cIt was not a dive,\u201d the RB sporting director, Ralf Rangnick, insisted, too, the next day. \u201cTimo could have gone down earlier. Then there would have been no debate.\u201d Surprisingly the Leipzig manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, passed up a chance to further his credentials as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s possible successor. Yes, he had seen the incident. No, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a penalty,\u201d the Austrian said. On Sunday, Werner at last admitted to diving as well. He had already apologised to the Schalke players in their dressing room following the end of the match. Werner will not be banned retroactively. The German FA could have become involved only if he had expressly lied to Dankert on the pitch. That unsatisfactory state of affairs should soon be alleviated by the introduction of a video referee, but whether Dankert will personally be allowed to benefit is doubtful. His failure to probe Werner a little harder will be held against him. Werner, for his part, is hopefully young enough to learn from his mistakes. No one, with the exception of Superman, is born a hero. You grow into it. He\u2019ll surely think twice before going down again. In the meantime, Leipzig sponsors Red Bull \u2013 whose online magazine Red Bulletin publishes columns by yours truly \u2013 might well be forced to alter their slogan for fear of sending the wrong message. \u201cNo, maybe, \u201cyes, we can!\u201d (geddit?) could be the new claim, as the team continue to go strong. \u201cThe debate [about the dive] doesn\u2019t change the fact that Leipzig performed impressively,\u201d S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung wrote. What\u2019s more, the manner of the success against a well-motivated but ultimately inferior Schalke side will speed up the process of normalisation. Leipzig, we know now, can win just as dirty, cynically, as any other top Bundesliga team. Talking points \u2022 Hurrah for the White Shirts (and red shorts)! Hamburger SV have won a league game, their first in 204 days. Michael Gregoritsch and Matthias Ostrzolek scored to defeat completely demoralised Darmstadt 2-0 at the B\u00f6llenfalltor on Sunday. Was the ban on mobile phones in the training camp wot won it? Markus Gisdol had told his players not to check up on their bad reviews, \u201cbut they\u2019re allowed to read them again on Monday,\u201d the HSV manager laughed. Getting beaten by the Dino was the final straw for Norbert Meier. The 58-year-old manager of the Lilies was relieved of his duties following the fifth league defeat in a row. \u2022 At the other end of the food chain, Carlo Ancelotti can breathe a little easier. The Spielerversteher \u2013 a coach who understands and accommodates his players \u2013 has started listening to the team\u2019s wishes and finally changed the formulaic 4-3-3 system to a more dynamic, fluid 4-2-3-1 formation that provided a much needed attacking impetus. Bayern Munich duly turned in one of their best performances this season, beating Mainz 3-1 away with considerable style and ease. \u2022 The Borussia Dortmund manager, Thomas Tuchel, too, staved off all crisis talk thanks to a 4-1 win over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach that showcased the welcome return of Marco Reus to the Bundesliga. The Germany international made two goals, one each for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, as BVB outpaced Andr\u00e9 Schubert\u2019s enduringly lame Foals. \u2022 Julian Nagelsmann had asked for \u201cmore masculine football\u201d before Hoffenheim\u2019s home game v 1. FC K\u00f6ln, perhaps in an effort to prove that he can mix innovative methods with some non-PC, old-school rhetoric. His team, led by the reassuringly manly, confident Sandro Wagner up front, certainly responded well enough: K\u00f6ln suffered their heaviest defeat of the season, 4-0, at the Wirsol-Rhein-Neckar-Arena. \u201cI\u2019ve been the best German striker for a while by some distance,\u201d Wagner claimed after scoring two goals, his 16th and 17th in the calendar year. The 29-year-old\u2019s lack of humility is almost as remarkable as his scoring rate, but fourth-placed Hoffenheim undoubtedly benefit from that kind of arrogance. Nagelsmann has managed to transform last season\u2019s relegation strugglers into one of the league\u2019s most impressive collectives. \u2022 VFL Wolfsburg are the opposite. They have plenty of big names in the squad but not much of a team. On Saturday, they lost their heads, too. A late dismissal for Paul Seguin paved the way for a silly Daniel Caligiuri foul on Hertha\u2019s Marvin Plattenhardt; Salomon Kalou converted the penalty to snatch a 3-2 win at the Volkswagen Stadion. Hertha\u2019s win was another one of these low-key, hard-work triumphs that make up their excellent run but Wolfsburg appear like a club at odds with itself at the moment. Sporting director Klaus Allofs is under increasing pressure, Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl\u2019s inexperience on the bench is a worry, and Julian Draxler is now being singled out for abuse by the supporters. The Germany international is very much for sale this January.
