There are considerations of Chinese characters (\"largely phonetic\", the author insists, perhaps exaggerating for effect), \"pseudodecipherments\" of ancient scripts, and a quixotic universal writing system, invented in the mid-20th century, called Blissymbolics. Enjoyably geeky info-dumps \u2013 such as a table of ASCII encodings, and examples of voice spectra \u2013 festoon the pages. The author occasionally smiles: speculating on how the first symbols for numbers came about, he observes (for all the world as though he has tried it): \"It is awkward to have to stamp 20 sheep symbols every time one wants to indicate 20 sheep.\" It is tempting to wonder whether some curious misprints \u2013 \"luther\" for either; \"bort\" for both \u2013 constitute a sly joke about our own language-processing abilities. Crack Capitalism by John Holloway (Pluto, \u00a317.99) Assuming, for the sake of argument, that you want to bring down capitalism, how should you go about it? Holloway urges readers to create \"cracks\" in the edifice: in lieu of \"alienated labour\", choose to do something you think is necessary or interesting. Just reading a book in a park is a good crack, and a person who does this, on Holloway's analysis, is on a continuum with more apparently impressive dissidents such as guerrilla gardeners, rioting Greek students or his beloved Zapatistas. The slight German-philosophy-in-translation feel of some of the prose (what are the hyphens doing in \"clock-time is the time-in-which we live\"?) is perhaps excused by the rather lovely suggestion Holloway floats that, because nouns (\"car\", \"wall\", \"food\") hide the activity that gave rise to them, \"anti-capitalist literature should abandon nouns and just use verbs\". The author hastens to add: \"but that would be very difficult to write and probably difficult to understand.\" That \"probably\" is infectiously optimistic, much like the suggestion that we should use a car \"as a receptacle for planting flowers or carrots\". Guardian readers are urged to try this and report the results. The Upside of Irrationality by Dan Ariely (HarperCollins, \u00a316.99) Another in the burgeoning heap of books that repackage evidence from psychology about cognitive biases, emotions and so forth in order (or so they promise) to help us choose better when in the market for consumables or romantic partners. Ariely, a psychologist and \"behavioural economist\", subtitles his effort \"The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home\", though the assumption that phenomena such as procrastination or \"hedonic adaptation\" (getting used to good or bad things) are actually illogical or irrational is never really justified. Banking that objection, the reader may allow herself to be skilfully edutained, learning that \"sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy\", or that we \"overvalue\" Ikea furniture precisely because we have to knock it together; and there are some amusing tales of \"customer revenge\" and speed-dating experiments. The text is friendly but sometimes irritatingly pert (exclamation marks are used to indicate something that is supposed to be funny), and the self-helpish conclusions may surprise few: \"try doing something new\". I tried smearing the latter half of the book with jam before reading it, but all I got was strange looks from the neighbouring caf\u00e9 tables."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
