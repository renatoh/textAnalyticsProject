Our roof was damaged and our windows were blown out. The night before D-Day we were in the cellar but, of course, we had no idea we were about to be liberated. The house was shaking so badly that we thought everything was going to collapse. With my mother and grandmother, I crept out to the compost heap. We all had kitchen gardens, with rabbits and hens. One of my jobs was to cut grass and feed it to the rabbits. Another job was picking Colorado beetles out of the German officers' potatoes. In return, they fed us. The Germans had arrived on 19 June 1940. The schools stayed open until December 1943 - we wrote poems to Marshal P\u00e9tain. I was also a server for the local priest. All boys were servers or choristers then. But being a server meant I had to do funerals all the time and often the coffins were those of children my size. It must have been about 7.30am and the bombs and shells were raining down and we were huddled by the compost. A neighbour came looking for us and told my mother: 'Marie, this is going to be a long raid. I know a shelter.' We followed him to a garden shed that belonged to the house opposite. There were other people in there. Moments after we had got into the shed, there was an explosion and a piece of shrapnel cut into my left thigh. Later, we saw the compost heap had been completely flattened. After about an hour's shelling, there was a lull. One of the men with us, Ernest Villaudi\u00e8re, put a pillow on his head and ventured out for news. We could hear exchanges of fire about 300 metres away at the casino. When Mr Villaudi\u00e8re returned he had cigarettes. He told us he had met some British soldiers and that we had been liberated. From that moment on, it was just euphoria. A British soldier treated my shrapnel wound. Another gave me a pair of boxing gloves that had been the lucky charm in his tank. I still have them, as well as two British penknives, several badges and insignia. I spent all my time with the British troops and my mother did their laundry. They gave us tins of corned beef. We gave them cider. My mother also tended the temporary grave on the beach of a British soldier: I remember the wooden cross and the helmet on it. Life was much harder after 6 June. We were bombed all the time. One day, I was sitting outside our house watching six British soldiers doing some roadwork. Suddenly they were hit in a huge explosion that killed five of them. One survived. He was Wilfred Blower of the 303 Company Pioneer Corps. His abdomen was wide open. My mother and grandmother and I dragged him into our kitchen and did what we could until the medics arrived. In 1990, Private Blower's son, Derek, born in 1944, tracked me down. He told me his father lived another 23 years after the war. Derek, who lives in Pendlebury, Manchester, is coming over for the anniversary with his wife. I hope we will spend some time together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
