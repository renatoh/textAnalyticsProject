They took their orders very seriously because of the harsh punishments for any breaches and because of the upset it caused their families. Most felt ashamed when their pictures were posted up in public around their estates. The only research I could find that supported the \"badge of honour\" theory was a report by the Youth Justice Board in 2006, which highlighted that some parents felt young people were proud of them. Though it seems based on no evidence, this idea is used in virtually every asbo story. I'm glad that Theresa May has decided asbos are criminalising and coercive and need replacing with something rehabilitating and restorative. But I feel extremely disappointed that it took a Conservative government and large budget deficit for this to be recognised. I just hope asbos are not replaced with anything that alienates young people even more. Kate Brown University of Leeds \u2022 Your coverage of Theresa May's speech quotes the latest figures on the fall in the number of asbos issued, seemingly as a justification for the decision of the home secretary to remove this sanction available to the police and communities. Strangely, you neglect to mention the latest statistics on public experiences of antisocial behaviour from the British Crime Survey published on 15 July. This shows that the proportion of the population experiencing antisocial behaviour is at its lowest level since it was first included in the survey nine years ago.
