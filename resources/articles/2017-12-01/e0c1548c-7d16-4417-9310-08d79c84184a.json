At the very end of the last Madrid-Bar\u00e7a, Messi stood to the left of the goal at the north end of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, shirt off and held up for all to see; at the very end of the latest Madrid-Bar\u00e7a, exactly eight months later and a little over eight metres away, he lay on the grass to the right of the goal at the north end of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, boot off and abandoned, unseen at first. Then, as now, Barcelona had just scored the third, only now he had given it instead of getting it: another visit, another victory, and maybe this time a title too. If then there was hope, ultimately unfulfilled, this time there is expectation. A gigantic banner had welcomed the players on to the pitch dreaming of a \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d but those celebrating it were mostly wearing red and blue. Messi was wearing red and blue and, it was now revealed, white. In the last minute, he ran at Marcelo. The challenge saw him lose his boot but not his balance and, dashing to the line, sports sock exposed, the Brazilian tumbling behind him, he pulled it back for Vidal, slipping to the floor as he went. As Vidal\u2019s shot squirmed under Keylor Navas and over the line, he got up and ran to the scorer, leaping into his arms. Camera shutters clicked and when their pictures were developed handy circles superimposed over his sock showed everyone what they had missed. Ivan Rakitic arrived with the boot and as they broke Sergio Busquets drew near and, grinning, had a word in his ear. Merry Christmas, perhaps? The goal ended the game, and maybe the league. Barcelona had just beaten Madrid 3-0; for the first time in their history they had taken three points at the Bernab\u00e9u for a third season in a row, aggregate score 10-2. The most successful year in Real Madrid\u2019s history \u2013 their fifth title, the Club World Cup, was briefly offered to supporters before the game \u2013 closed with them all but handing back the league they won in May. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said. \u201cBut,\u201d he insisted, \u201cMadrid never surrender, no matter what. People can think the league is over but I don\u2019t think so and the opposition coach doesn\u2019t think so either.\u201d Ernesto Valverde didn\u2019t \u2013 or he didn\u2019t say so, anyway \u2013 yet as Zidane suspected, almost everyone else did and not without reason. High in the north stand, a few hundred Barcelona fans waved and sang \u201cGoodbye to the league, goodbye.\u201d A chant of \u201cCampeones\u201d followed. Elsewhere in the stadium, they streamed for the exits, making their way out into the sunshine in silence. What noise there was came in the form of whistles. Soon Barcelona\u2019s players were boarding planes at Barajas, heading home happy for their holidays. Valverde insisted \u201cwe\u2019re not even at halfway yet\u201d, but his team are already winter champions \u2013 an honorary \u2018title\u2019 handed to the team top at halfway when 19 games have been played and everyone has faced everyone once \u2013 and, as Marca\u2019s front page put it, \u201cvirtually summer champions too\u201d. \u201cBarcelona have gone,\u201d AS\u2019s cover said. Mundo Deportivo called it \u201cBestial\u201d, a 14 making up the I and the A to indicate the points gap between the two sides. Sport called them the \u201cfuture champions\u201d, its front page going for a simple: \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Victory also took Barcelona nine points clear of Atl\u00e9tico and 11 points ahead of Valencia, both of whom were beaten this weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Marcelo conceded. Sergio Ramos admitted: \u201cWe have to be realistic, it\u2019s very complicated.\u201d Even if Madrid win their game in hand \u2013 against Legan\u00e9s in February \u2013 and every other game too, Barcelona would still have to lose four times for them to win the league. So far this season, they have not lost one. The last time Barcelona were beaten was the last time they came here. It was the Spanish Super Cup and it was August. Neymar had just gone, and mentally they looked gone too. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 ended that game sitting on the bench verbally \u201cshitting on the bitch\u201d and muttering: \u201cthese guys are leading us a dance\u201d; he ended this one heading up the pitch, looking for a goal of his own. That was him forcing the last corner. By then, Barcelona dominated entirely, having slowly taken control as if by stealth, and he felt superior; back in August he had admitted that for the first time in nine years he felt \u201cinferior\u201d to Madrid. Since that night, Barcelona have played 25 games, 17 in the league, and have not lost, a resurrection quietly led by their new manager, who has guided them from crisis to the top of the table, unbeaten at Valencia, Atl\u00e9tico and Madrid, virtual champions at Christmas. Things change fast. \u201cIt\u2019s a lesson to us all,\u201d Valverde said, nailing it as he does so often. There was a warning there - \u201cthe advantage can be gone in a flash,\u201d he said \u2013 and a nod not just to his own team\u2019s turnaround but Madrid\u2019s too, urging caution and respect, a hint of Mr Wolf in his words. If it has happened once, twice, it can happen a third time. Madrid won it all: European and domestic champions for the first time in 59 years, the talk was not just of having finally returned to the summit, winning a second league title in eight years and adding the European Cup, but staying there, a new era all of their own. And now this: the league almost relinquished before the winter\u2019s even out. \u201cYou lot have become too used to a good thing; this is sport, you can lose,\u201d Marcelo said, while Ramos insisted that the cl\u00e1sico defeat could not wipe out 2017: \u201cAnyone who thinks this is a failure should look at the stats,\u201d he said. Yet defeat was a damaging one, places had been changed. \u201cBack then people said they were sunk, tomorrow it\u2019s us that will be \u2018sunk\u2019,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cThere will be hostias,\u201d he added. The hostia is the body of Christ, wafer-thin, the holy host, the consecrated bread, but it has multiple-meaning here, many of them sweary. It\u2019s also a blow, a punch, a beating, a kicking and he was right: the kicking was coming. When Karim Benzema departed he was whistled, one radio commentator declaring playing with him akin to playing with 10, and by then they really were playing with 10 of course after Dani Carvajal\u2019s superb one-handed save from Paulinho. Cristiano Ronaldo swung at his side\u2019s best chance and missed the ball entirely. Sergio Ramos had hit out at Luis Su\u00e1rez, and while he claimed that \u201cin Catalonia they\u2019ll say I should go to jail, like Carles Puigdemont\u201d, who is not actually in jail but in Belgium, there were complaints from the capital too. And there was criticism of the way Madrid took a step back in the second half, even if Valverde insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t think that was a conscious decision.\u201d By the end most agreed that Navas had been Madrid\u2019s best player. Barcelona won 3-0 and ultimately it could have been much more. \u201cMadrid throw in the towel,\u201d said the cover of AS. \u201cMadrid hand over the league,\u201d ran Marca\u2019s website. The talk before the game was whether Barcelona would give Madrid, the recently crowned world champions, a pasillo, a guard of honour, standing back and applauding them on to the field, letting them pass, as they had done in 2008. In the end, for all the polls and the faux anger and the furious mass debates, they didn\u2019t. In the end, the critics said, it was Madrid who gave Barcelona a pasillo: standing back and letting them go, offering them an avenue through which to pass. \u201cThe pasillo was from Madrid,\u201d said AS; \u201cPasillo for Barcelona,\u201d said Marca. Above all, the hostias were Zidane\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s football; I accept that,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t regret anything and I won\u2019t ever change.\u201d This time, he had: his decision to leave out Isco, arguably their best player in 2017, and play Mateo Kovacic instead, was at the heart of the analyses and the attacks. \u201cZidane confuses Madrid,\u201d wrote Javier Sill\u00e9s in AS. \u201cZidane hands Barcelona a pasillo,\u201d said El Mundo. The cover of Marca sent him to the naughty step \u2013 the \u201cthinking corner\u201d, as it\u2019s called in Spain, where he was told to contemplate what he had done. What he had done is employ Kovacic in a specific role with a dual function designed to stop Barcelona playing. A loose element, separate from the structure of the rest of the midfield, his job was to press Sergio Busquets, preventing Barcelona from bringing the ball out, and also then drop in and pick up Leo Messi \u2013 like a double man-marking job, one after the other and one ahead of the other. As the game progressed, and the balance tilted, as Barcelona edged their way up the pitch, the focus became more Messi than Busquets. By the time the second half began, the shift seemed definitive. And when the opening goal came, on 54 minutes, the idea was exposed as if the whole plan was portrayed in one picture, that single moment, flaws and folly laid bare. When Barcelona got the second 10 minutes later, Carvajal sent off just as Zidane was about to send Bale and Asensio on, Messi smashing in the penalty, bowing, blowing a kiss, and standing before the north end, arms outstretched, it was over. Then, eventually, Vidal rounded it off. But it had begun with Busquets, though. And with Kovacic. A drag-back, a Cruyff turn, and Busquets eased away from Toni Kroos, pulse barely registering. Unusually, Casemiro was ahead of the ball (normally he is behind it), knowing that Kovacic was behind him. Here came the ball out from the back that Madrid feared, the exit that exposed them. That left the other element that concerned them: Messi. Busquets cut out Luka Modric with the kind of pass with which Modric cuts out others, sending Rakitic running through the middle. Others ran too, Piqu\u00e9 included, too many of Madrid\u2019s players not included. Kovacic was the only one in Rakitic\u2019s path but instead of stepping towards him, he moved towards Messi, heading away from the ball, so the Croatian went on alone and unattended, almost unable to believe it. He reached the edge of the area and played the ball to Sergi Roberto who, first time, threaded it across to where Luis Su\u00e1rez was arriving and he hit it under Navas. And there it was: the pasillo they talked about, provided by Zidane and Kovacic. Which meant that there, too, were hostias. It was easy. It might also have been a little unfair. For much of the first half, the plan had worked. Certainly, the cl\u00e1sico did not entirely delegitimise it. Nor, though, did it entirely legitimise it. In the opening 45 minutes, Madrid had more of the possession, created a couple of decent chances \u2013 Ronaldo missed one entirely, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Ter Stegen saved another with his foot and Benzema hit the post \u2013 and largely denied Barcelona a way out. Equally, while the heart of the media analyses was Messi \u2013 perhaps limited by the perspective offered by TV? \u2013 it was more when the focus tilted towards him and away from Busquets that flaws in Madrid\u2019s gameplan were exposed, although given the energy needed to execute it, perhaps that was always likely to be the way. And to start with, it had the desired effect. \u201cWe found it difficult to find a way out; they went virtually man to man on us and we were forced to go long,\u201d Valverde admitted. The thing is, that\u2019s something his team\u2019s prepared to do; they\u2019re also prepared to risk playing through pressure, the reward for which is increasingly a player in possession, pitch ahead of him. Sometimes, it is just a case of having the patience to wait for that moment. Resistance is a quality Barcelona have developed, discipline too. Compact, organised, even in the first half the best two chances were perhaps theirs \u2013 both for Paulinho \u2013 and slowly they took control. By the second half, that control was complete. If they have not always convinced this season, here they did, possession theirs, opportunities too. By the end it was 3-0 and not just against any team, against Real Madrid \u2013 without Neymar, without Dembele, without Coutinho and without Samuel Umtiti too. Go through the team and it is impossible to find a player who didn\u2019t play well. Iniesta glided, described as the Mona Lisa in El Pa\u00eds; Vermaelen quietly did everything right; no one went past Piqu\u00e9 and no one was fouled by Piqu\u00e9, either; Alba occupied a wing alone, again, and sent a backheel through Modric\u2019s legs; Ter Stegen stood tall and strong; every decision Sergi Roberto takes is the correct one, executed cleanly and quickly; Su\u00e1rez scored one and provided a wonderful pass that should have led to another; Paulinho has something no one else does, \u201csurprise\u201d according to Valverde. He meant on the pitch, but there are plenty off it surprised too. And Busquets\u2019s cool clip over Carvajal might even be better than his part in the opening goal, the perfect illustration of how inviting pressure is not as suicidal as it can seem. When it comes to breaking the press, no one does it better and when Busquets plays, Barcelona play. There\u2019s a reason Zidane wanted to stop him. There\u2019s a reason, above all, why he wanted to stop Messi playing, even to the point of sacrificing his most creative player: he is very, very good at football and just about every part of football. The plan might not have worked, but that\u2019s not to say the idea was necessarily wrong; certainly not to say it was impossible to understand. In the aftermath of the cl\u00e1sico, the day that Barcelona took a huge step towards another league title \u2013 their ninth in the 13 years since Messi has been a starter \u2013 much of the criticism focussed on the idea that Zidane was afraid of Messi. And there may be something in that, but there is also an obvious response: \u201cWell, yeah. Wouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d In their match report, AS made the baffling claim that Barcelona \u201cdidn\u2019t need Messi to beat Madrid\u201d. Given what Zidane did, that would be wrong even if Messi had done nothing all game, just his presence conditioning the cl\u00e1sico, but Messi didn\u2019t do nothing. In fact, he did pretty much everything. Watching it back, the variety and sheer number of things he does is extraordinary. Even in the first half an hour or so, when space was denied and Madrid\u2019s plan appeared to be working, even when a case could be made for suggesting that he was under control and Modric was arguably the man who most impressed, Messi provided the two best chances for Paulinho, the first from an absurdly good pass. And then, step by step, he took to the stage, until there he was standing at the north end of the stadium with his team-mates, victorious again. The stats bear out the sensations, even though they can\u2019t explain everything, even though they can\u2019t measure the timing, the decision-making, the control, the effect on all those around him. According to Who Scored, Messi had 81 touches, more than any Madrid player and second only to Busquets; he completed six dribbles, three times more than all the Madrid players put together, and played more passes than any Madrid player except Modric, completing 88% of them. He made three tackles; only Toni Kroos and Busquets made more. He made nine key passes, more than twice as many as any other player, and created more chances than anyone had made in any game this season. Against Real Madrid. At the Bernab\u00e9u. On the day they man-marked him. Which is why even when Messi didn\u2019t do anything, he was decisive. The breakthrough came when Barcelona, for once, didn\u2019t look for him \u2013 because Madrid did. And while it would be a push to credit him for that, there\u2019s something in it. Then he scored the penalty to make it 2-0. Sure, it\u2019s only a penalty but that\u2019s his 54th goal in 2017 (only Harry Kane, one behind, can catch him now) and the man who scored a cl\u00e1sico hat-trick at 19 has got more goals in this fixture than anyone else. Besides, Messi\u2019s passes made the penalty in the first place. Look, too, at the other chances made, the quality not just the quantity of his delivery, his vision: no easy through ball into space, simple cut back, or set-play swung into the box here; these are something else. His pass to Paulinho is fantastic, that Messi ball which one opposition manager admitted they all know is coming but don\u2019t know when and can\u2019t stop it. The pass to Andre Gomes leaves him clean through but he hits it over. The pass to Semedo is wonderful, but Navas saves. And the pass to Su\u00e1rez is brilliant, but eventually, via another pass, Carvajal saves. And, then, at the end of it all, when the ball was about to go out \u2013 maybe it does? \u2013 and the clock was ticking down on the last cl\u00e1sico of 2017, Leo Messi sprinted across, slid in to stop it, turned, ran behind Asensio, received the pass, dashed beyond Marcelo and found Vidal for the third goal, leaving his boot behind and leaving Real Madrid behind too. Results and Talking Points Levante 0-0 Legan\u00e9s Getafe 2-0 Las Palmas Real Sociedad 3-1 Sevilla Eibar 4-1 Girona Alav\u00e9s 1-0 M\u00e1laga Betis 0-2 Athletic Espanyol 1-0 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 0-3 Barcelona Valencia 0-1 Villarreal Deportivo 1-3 Celta Alav\u00e9s are out of the relegation zone! Which is why it was a bit weird to see Munir apologising when he scored the goal that lifted them up to 17th, but he wanted to say sorry for making them suffer with all the chances he had missed before. When he eventually volleyed in the winner in a huge match against M\u00e1laga, they didn\u2019t care any more. That\u2019s three wins out of four under new manager Abelardo \u2013 and the one they didn\u2019t win was a 1-0 defeat at the Wanda. Before the Galician derby, Luisinho claimed that Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a were the \u201cbig team\u201d in the region, given their history. Meanwhile, Celta\u2019s captain is Hugo Mallo, a local boy and a man who has a bit of form when it comes to winding up Depor. So when Celta won 3-1, with two of the goals scored by his best mate Iago Aspas, it was no surprise that he gave some back. \u201cSomeone should tell Luisinho that you don\u2019t talk in the press, you talk on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Deportivo were big but if they still were now Luisinho wouldn\u2019t be playing for them.\u201d As for Aspas, who has scored more goals in 2017 than anyone else in Spain except Messi and Su\u00e1rez, the first in the derby celebrated by standing still before the Depor fans, soaking it all up with his hand on the Celta badge, the second a belting free-kick, he could not resist having a go too: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has been hiding in a coffin for the last four years because there have been eight derbies and Depor only won one.\u201d Luisinho responded: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk now. You can see what cowards their players are. Deportivo is the best team in Galicia, a big team in Spain and what I said is no lie. I know it annoys them, but that\u2019s a fact. \u201cWe\u2019re not running out of gas,\u201d Marcelino insisted, but inside Valencia they know that they need reinforcements this winter. And they knew that even before they were beaten 1-0 by Villarreal, falling to their third defeat in four having been unbeaten until then. Six years under Simeone, and Atl\u00e9tico are better than ever. That\u2019s what the stats say about 2017, anyway. And yet they\u2019re out of the Champions League of course \u2013 and on Friday night Atl\u00e9tico were atl\u00e9tico\u2019d, caught by a late winner at Espanyol, scored by Sergio Garc\u00eda. Who\u2019s still around, and still got something, that\u2019s for sure. Alarm bells are ringing at Ipurua, but don\u2019t worry: that\u2019s good. A factory siren still greets every goal and they\u2019ve been getting quite a few of them lately. They stuffed four past Girona and finish the year in seventh just three points off a European place. A few days after he returned from prostate cancer surgery and even fewer days before Christmas, Sevilla sacked Eduardo Berizzo. And, well, it\u2019s not easy to know what to say to that really. It is rather easier to know what to say to this, and it rhymes with \u201cduck cough\u201d. The Atl\u00e9tico Madrid president, Enrique Cerezo, says: \u201cFootball should lose feeling.\u201d And what a way to go. Adi\u00f3s, Carlos Vela, the foreign player who has made the second most appearances in the club\u2019s history and who scored on his last game for Real Sociedad. Happy Christmas from everyone here. And from Fuenlabrada. Oh, and from Sporting and Oviedo. Much, much better: Happy Christmas from Villarreal and Bacca and Bakambu!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
