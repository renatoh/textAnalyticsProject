We only lived in Glasgow for about 18 months, but it was enough to get hooked. I gave my husband a subscription for his birthday so we had a copy every day. We then moved to Germany because of my husband's new academic position. Henrik has a PhD in geology and I have a PhD in linguistics. I did not realise how much I missed the Guardian until a friend from Scotland sent us a weekend edition. That enlivened our lives so much that we decided to get a weekend subscription. I like all the writers, but the ones who stand out are Tim Dowling, Zoe Williams and Alex Petridis. I was very moved by the personal account of the earthquake in New Zealand by David Haywood in February. But then, we used to live in Christchurch, and he is a friend of ours. My favourite section is the Family section. I save it until last and read every letter of it. I also like the writer of the Diary of a Separation column, and Annalisa Barbieri. I am Dutch and my husband Henrik is German. We met in the US in 2000 and we have lived in Christchurch, Sydney, Glasgow and now in Greifswald, Germany. All this moving about was for academic reasons. We have two children: Hugo, born in Sydney, and Jannes, born in Glasgow. Living in Scotland was great, because of the Guardian, the BBC, and the lovely Scottish people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
