Soon after, witnesses \u2013 including journalists from the newspaper \u2013 began describing dramatic scenes. Phil Davis, the Gazette\u2019s crime and court reporter, tweeted shortly after 3.30pm local time: \u201cA single shooter shot multiple people at my office, some of whom are dead.\u201d A string of tweets followed: \u201cGunman shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees. Can\u2019t say much more and don\u2019t want to declare anyone dead, but it\u2019s bad,\u201d he posted. In one of the most chilling tweets of the series, Davis said: \u201cThere is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you\u2019re under your desk and then hear the gunman reload.\u201d Aerial video footage came soon after, showing people evacuated from the building in a line with their hands up. Police soon confirmed that one suspect was in custody. \u201cWe believe there are no other shooters in the building,\u201d Bill Krampf, acting chief of Anne Arundel county police, said at a press conference near the scene. Davis later noted that he was safely evacuated and was waiting to be interviewed by police. Joshua McKerrow, a photojournalist for the Capital Gazette and the Baltimore Sun, tweeted: \u201cI am safe. Was not there\u201d \u2013 even as he headed to the scene to start reporting. Soon after he posted a set of pictures showing heavily armed law enforcement officers standing guard at the scene and multiple official vehicles. Earlier he had noted: \u201cMassive police response to shooting in my newsroom in Annapolis.\u201d As reports of multiple fatalities were confirmed by law enforcement officials, at 4.36pm local time, McKerrow tweeted one word: \u201cHeartbroken.\u201d Authorities said a reunification location was being established at the Lord &amp; Taylor department store at the Westfield Annapolis mall, for witnesses or survivors to gather ahead of being reunited with loved ones. Donald Trump was informed of the incident and posted a muted tweet: \u201cPrior to departing Wisconsin, I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene.\u201d The Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, tweeted that he was \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d and called the shooting a tragedy. An hour after his first post, McKerrow, the photographer, tweeted another message, listing the names of his colleagues who had survived the attack \u2013 including Messenger, the intern. \u201cChase Cook, Pat Ferguson, Paul Gillespie, Phil Davis, Selene San Felice, Anthony Messenger all ok,\u201d he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
