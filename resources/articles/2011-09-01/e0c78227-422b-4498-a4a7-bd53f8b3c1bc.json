But there may be more actual three-dimensional bodies around than I thought. Last week I went to what seemed a perfectly ordinary pub, the Old Red Lion, but upstairs in a little theatre Pat Starr and Marsha Norman put on a moving play, 'Night, Mother, about a mother trying to stop her daughter killing herself. The huge half-empty church I live opposite stages local concerts; producer Claire Chapwell puts on plays which are about older people exclusively and delightedly acted by them, and a school play about Greece stopped at least some kids thinking Homer is just Homer Simpson's first name. Pubs have traditional jazz afternoons; our local community centre had Marcia Mellow, an American guitarist and quick-change artist, keep her audience enthralled; and come to think of it, all those goofy fringe things at the Edinburgh festival must have started somewhere else first. We don't just sit there gawping at screens, consuming prepackaged recorded stuff; the urge to get together with real live people, dress up and put on a show has never gone away. And if it seems really preposterous, we can always say we're doing it for charity \u2013 for charity, anything goes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
