The jury was told that Jaden Moodie, 14, was a dealer for a rival gang, and was riding a moped in January 2019 in London when he was knocked off it and set upon. He suffered catastrophic injuries from nine stab wounds as he lay defenceless in the road. Ayoub Majdouline, 19, and four accomplices are alleged to have staged the attack, while driving a stolen black Mercedes car. Majdouline is on trial at the Old Bailey, in central London, where, on Wednesday, the jury was told of undisputed facts agreed between the prosecution and defence. Those facts included that, in 2018, after a referral the previous year, the defendant had been deemed by the National Crime Agency to be a victim of modern slavery. This conclusion was reached because he had been seen in Hampshire, an area with which he had no connection, in the company of a known drug dealer. The court heard that Majdouline, whose birth father died in 2015, had left his mother\u2019s home after being abused by his stepfather. He then went to live with his paternal aunt but also suffered problems there and was subsequently placed in a number of foster homes. The jury was told that the defendant had a number of convictions for carrying knives and drug dealing since he was 16, including serving two terms in Feltham young offenders institution, in west London. Asked by his defence counsel, James Scobie QC, what he got out of drug dealing, Majdouline replied: \u201cSomewhere to stay, a little payment and, like, I didn\u2019t have to spend money on food and stuff \u2026 I could buy weed and stuff.\u201d Questioned as to what would happen if he did not do what he was told to by the person who ran his drugs line, the defendant said: \u201cGet beaten up or stabbed.\u201d He said he was beaten up once because his takings from drug sales were short. Majdouline said he went back to dealing drugs after leaving Feltham because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like I was being supported by social services\u201d. He said he carried a knife because of the threat posed by users and rival gang members but had never used a blade against anyone other than to brandish it as a threat on one occasion. The court heard that Majdouline was an associate of the Mali gang, based in Leyton E10, which also operates in E17, and is known to be involved in child exploitation and county lines operations. The jury was told that Jaden was linked to the Beaumont Crew, or Let\u2019s Get Rich gang, based in Waltham Forest, also E10, for whom he dealt drugs. Jaden pleaded guilty in November 2018 to possession of an imitation firearm and allegations against the teenager relating to possession of class A drugs were unresolved at the time of his death. In March of that year he had accepted a youth conditional caution for possession of a firearm with intent, possession of a knife or sharp bladed article and possession of drugs. Before his death, threats were made in person by people believed to be gang members against his mother and sister, the court heard. The jury has previously heard that yellow rubber gloves recovered from a drain contained DNA from Jaden and Majdouline, his alleged attacker. A knife also recovered from the drain showed traces of Jaden\u2019s blood on the blade and the defendant\u2019s DNA on the handle, the jury was told. Majdouline denies the murder on 8 January this year in London and an additional charge of carrying a knife. The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
