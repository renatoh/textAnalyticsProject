Who won? a) Jacky Ickx b) Jackie Stewart c) Pedro Rodr\u00edguez Email your answer to f1gp@belgiumtheplaceto.be before Friday 31 July 2008. Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium, 7 September If you're going to one race this year, make it this one, says Giles Richards The doubters have it that no sport was more intended for televising than Formula One. To which I say: Bite me, doubters. Bite my highly engineered, wind tunnel-tested aerodynamic butt. There's quite simply nothing like the spectacle and sound of watching F1 live. TV simply does no justice to the exhilarating speed of the cars and the sheer, shuddering power of their braking potential, or to the ear shattering noise - muted on the small screen to the buzz of mildly perturbed bees. It's expensive, of course, but then so is going to watch Chelsea, and the usual complaint - that they all whizz past and are gone - really doesn't cut it any more. Almost all circuits now feature some stands that overlook whole complexes of the track and all boast big screens allowing you to follow the action when it's passed. What's that? You want to go? But can't bear being stuck in Silverstone's traffic? Don't blame you. There's nothing worse than staring at the back end of a Fiesta for hours. So how about one of motor racing's most beautiful circuits instead? Just a few hours away by train is Spa-Francorchamps, which held its first Belgian GP in 1924. A drivers' favourite, set in the Ardennes hills, it's one of a dwindling number of F1 circuits with a lengthy racing history, whose layout was dictated by the contours of the land rather than a designer's hand. In Eau Rouge and Blanchimont, it boasts two of the most famous corners in motor racing and has seen more spectacular competition than most of the new circuits combined. There's no more powerful contrast in the sport than that between Spa's mist-shrouded forest in the early morning and an F1 race exploding into life among the trees. And, it being in Belgium, you can score some top-end chocolate on the way home, too. Try experiencing all that on TV. Terms and conditions No purchase necessary. Only one entry per person.
