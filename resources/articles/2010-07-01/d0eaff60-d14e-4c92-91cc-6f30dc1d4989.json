It's not a fashionable poem these days, too martial and caught up with Empire notions of stoicism and duty, but it seemed fitting that the first few lines, inspired by the author's memories of lessons learnt on the Close of nearby Clifton College, should fit the final act of the game at Nevil Road. England's match against Bangladesh did come down to the last man in with \"ten to make and the match to win\". Bangladesh were already celebrating victory when Bell belatedly emerged to join Jonathan Trott. They had assumed that his fractured metatarsal, sustained during a freak landing while fielding, instead of from what Richie Benaud was always delighted to call a \"sandshoe crusher\", would make him unable to bat. But in Bell came to station himself at the non-striker's end in the hope that Trott could knock off the 10 runs from the last over and spare England the chagrin of being defeated for the first time by their commonly derided opponents. In the end, however, he did not have to face a ball as Trott edged to the wicketkeeper, six runs short of the target. But it remains a valiant undertaking and one which reflects well on the team spirit forged by the coach, Andy Flower. The appearance of an injured batsman is a rare enough sight in Test cricket but I struggle to remember even one example of it in one-day matches. So numerous and throwaway are the fixtures that you assume the results in the long term matter as little to the players as they do to the spectators and not worth the risk of participating while hurt. Even in Tests, the potential hazards seem too great. Nasser Hussain sometimes gritted his teeth to complete a match when one of his frequently broken \"poppadom\" fingers suffered its latest injury but discretion usually resurfaced in time for him to sit out the subsequent games until they had properly healed. In 1981 Allan Border batted for more than 15 hours during the Old Trafford and Oval Ashes Tests with a broken finger but he was almost masochistic in his desire to wear the scars of battle. And, some may say, sadistic, too when it came to his team\u2011mates. After all, it was he who said to Dean Jones during Australia's tied Test with India at Madras in 1986 when his partner had succumbed to severe dehydration and disorientation while accumulating a double century: \"You weak Victorian, I want a tough Australian out there. Let's get a Queenslander in.\" He set a template for toughness to which Steve Waugh was happy to subscribe in his one-legged innings at The Oval in 2001 after tearing his calf two Tests earlier. Not so much limping as hopping, he still made an unbeaten 157 and by the end of the game he stood like a sleeping flamingo. In the Centenary Test in 1977, meanwhile, Rick McCosker, another Australian, came in to bat at No10 and put on 54 with Rod Marsh while looking like a mummy with bandages wrapped around his chin to hold the jaw broken by a Bob Willis bouncer in place. My most vivid memories of foolhardy bravery came during England's drubbing by West Indies in 1984. At Headingley, Malcolm Marshall helped Larry Gomes to his century despite a double fracture of the thumb and made four in a comical one\u2011handed cameo. He then took seven wickets to prove that West Indies in their pomp could destroy England almost with one hand tied behind their backs. Later in that series Paul Terry was even more inconvenienced, but he batted with a broken arm in a sling under his jumper to get Allan Lamb to his hundred and, supposedly, save the follow\u2011on. But Lamb scampered a two to take him to his century and left the stricken Terry on strike and the inevitable happened. For all those acts of courage, though, it seems silly that cricket's aversion to a demonstrably injured player, who has yet to bat or bowl in the match, being replaced by a substitute who can do more than simply field, persists. It is illogical, too. If you are sanguine about a team being handicapped by injury, why should having 11 men in the field be sacrosanct? Newbolt's \"Play up! Play up! And play the game\" whatever the odds against you is a fine sentiment, but a misfortune such as Bell's would be better left unpunished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
