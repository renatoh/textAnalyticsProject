Chandler is not a small man, and he is not a poor man. After looking after the affairs of Lee Westwood and Ernie Els, to name just two of his clients, he has more than enough money to sit on his sofa until eternity. He has also seen more than enough golf to last this lifetime and the next, so it must have taken something very special to drag him out on to a golf course in the 85F heat of an Arizona afternoon. For his efforts, the head of International Sport Management was rewarded with a sweat-sodden shirt and a nasty attack from what the locals call a \"jumping cactus\". But he was still grinning through the pain when he got back to the clubhouse at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Tucson and he could not wait to explain why. \"He is a special, special kid; a special, special golfer,\" Chandler says of McIlroy, the 19-year-old Northern Irishman who turned pro at the end of 2007 amid high expectations and has since surpassed them all, winning in Dubai last month and rising to 16th in the world rankings. \"Four months ago, when people were saying to me that 'this kid McIlroy is good' I told them they actually had no idea how good he is. What they don't realise is just how good he hits the ball. Every single shot he hits is pure. You can go a long way in golf if you do that.\" Suffice to say, McIlroy already has gone a long way. After Tiger Woods departed Tucson, beaten in the second round of the Accenture World Match Play by Tim Clark, the insular American golf public woke up to the British teenager and embraced him. It is not hard to work out why. They like a winner, of course, and for the opening three days of this event McIlroy, who tasted defeat on the 17th green last night against Australia's Geoff Ogilvy, was a convincing winner. But his appeal is much more fundamental than that. Somewhere, somehow, professional golfers latched on to the mistaken idea that slow play equals good play. Spend an afternoon walking the fairways with, to pick a random name from many, Stewart Cink and you begin to wonder why any of this is worth watching. Spend that time watching McIlroy and it quickly becomes clear why golf is worth the effort. Unlike the drones of the PGA Tour, McIlroy steps up to his ball and gives it a hearty swipe. The only fuss involved is the fuss he creates outside the ropes. \"I think he plays the game like Seve [Ballesteros] did,\" argues Chandler. \"He gets up and hits his ball, chases after it and then hits it again. If it goes in the shit, then he gets in there and hits it out of the shit. It is just so bloody refreshing.\" Of course, not everyone on this side of the Atlantic has jumped on board the bandwagon. The starter on the 1st tee did not pay the teenager the courtesy of learning how to pronounce his name properly, (settling for the phonetically sinister \"Maaa-KILLroy\" rather than \"Mackill-roy\"), while Paul Azinger publicly doubted whether McIlroy was worth his high world ranking. But for every professional contrarian, there is a Butch Harmon, who knows a thing or two about the golf swing and has been raving about McIlroy's action this week to anyone who will listen. Meanwhile, the American golfing press, instinctively sniffy about any player who, like McIlroy, does not appear to believe the PGA Tour is the be-all and end-all, has embraced him, not least because, like Padraig Harrington, he has learned the value of showing a little respect in his dealings with the media. The cover of Sports Illustrated awaits, according to Chandler, and so does a fortune from sponsors who would wish to hitch their name to the most obvious aspect of McIlroy's appeal; his youth. McIlroy is 19, but might be 15. Walking from tee to green at this tournament, it was noticeable how many times he was called upon to exchange fist-bumps with pimply American youths who looked exactly as he does. If he had been born here, then these fans might have been his friends. \"Actually, he hasn't forgotten his friends at home, and his girlfriend [Holly] is there. The two of them are priceless,\" says Chandler, chuckling. \"The other night, before his match against Tim Clark he says to me 'Chubby, I'm going to stay up late so I can talk to Holly before she goes to school.' Anyway, he is talking to her and she says to him, 'I want to be an engineer when I grow up.' And then he says to her, 'You know, I am not sure what is going to happen when I grow up.'\" Yes he does. The question is how will he, and Chandler, handle the process of growing up so publicly and with such expectations. After all, the road to global fame and untold wealth is littered with shattered hopes of youthful prodigies who were overindulged and fell prey to get-rich-quick myopia of those who should have known better. Does the name Michelle Wie ring any bells? It does to Chandler's ears. \"Rory is completely different to Michelle Wie. For one thing, he has actually delivered \u2013 this isn't some kid with potential who might do this, and might do that. He has won tournaments, he is in the world top 20,\" Chandler says. \"The other thing is that he isn't in a hurry. The rules are different with him. Because he is so young, we can just let things unfold. People were saying he must have been disappointed not to get the chance to play Tiger this week \u2013 no he wasn't. He understands that there will be plenty of chances to play Tiger in years to come.\" Off the course, too, McIlroy and his handlers prefer to be patient, although some decisions have already been made. He will not, for instance, take up membership of the PGA Tour in America any time soon. The plan instead is to play around the world as often as he can. \"We have talked about this with him and the idea is to turn him into a global player \u2013 a junior Ernie Els, if you like. Rory has seen the way Ernie travels and, if possible, he would like to do something similar.\" It is an ambitious plan, but it will be aided by the emergence of Danny Lee, the 18-year-old New Zealand amateur who won a European Tour event in Australia last month, and Ryo Ishikawa, the 17-year-old Japanese player whose status in his homeland is akin to that of Woods in the United States. \"That is how the original big three came about \u2013 Nicklaus, Palmer, Player \u2013 right? Maybe it's just me, but I think Lee, Ishikawa and McIlroy could be the next big three,\" says Chandler. This is heady stuff, and potentially lucrative stuff, too. McIlroy's agent demurs. \"Sure, he could make a fortune tomorrow if he wanted, but Rory is in no rush because eventually everything will happen for him. \"We were fairly astute when he turned pro because we got him enough cash to build his profile and then stopped. The deals he got back then were worth seven figures. It wouldn't have made any difference if they had been worth \u00a33m or \u00a310m. For crying out loud, he is 19. He has bought himself a nice house, a nice car and a telly. What else does he need?\" What else indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
