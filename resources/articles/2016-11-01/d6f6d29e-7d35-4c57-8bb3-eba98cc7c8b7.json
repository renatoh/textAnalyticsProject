The case stems from a split within the Indigenous group whose consent is crucial for the planned $16bn mine in Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin to go ahead. A court action by opponents of Adani within the Wangan and Jagalingou people also alleges that a disputed vote in support of the deal in April was stacked with people who were not even members of the Indigenous land claim group. The contest in the W&amp;J over support for the mine is set to play out in a legal bid to have four pro-Adani representatives sidelined over \u201cmonetary benefits\u201d they allegedly pocketed against the terms of their appointment. The Queensland and federal governments are set to back the pro-Adani W&amp;J representatives when the court begins hearing the case on Tuesday. Indigenous rights advocate and W&amp;J elder Adrian Burragubba and others \u2013 on behalf of an anti-Adani faction that includes Australia\u2019s first Indigenous senior counsel, Tony McAvoy \u2013 argues in an application filed in court that the four who took \u201csitting fees\u201d to meet Adani exceeded their authority as representatives. Lawyers for Burragubba and others allege the four did not take all necessary steps to pay a total of $16,000 \u2013 which came on top of travel, meal and accommodation costs covered by Adani \u2013 into a trust for the W&amp;J. They argue that according to their terms of appointment by the claim group, they were not entitled to personally benefit from sitting fees. They also allege the four \u2013 Gwendoline Fisher, Priscilla Gyemore, Les Tilley and Norman Johnson Jnr \u2013 exceeded their authority by continuing to negotiate with Adani despite a W&amp;J claim group meeting calling for talks to end in March and for a land use deal to be rejected. The payment of discreet sitting fees by Adani was revealed by Guardian Australia in April. The four are among seven pro-Adani members of a representative group of 12, made up of the 12 descent groups of the W&amp;J, including Burragubba and the other applicants. The pro-Adani representatives swung majority support behind the mine for the first time this year, after the W&amp;J had formally voted down an Indigenous land use agreement twice in 2012 and 2014. Lawyers for Burragubba argue the four were replaced at a claim group meeting in March by new representatives who also oppose the mine. Lawyers for Fisher, Gyemore, Tilley and Johnson Jr responded in court papers by arguing that the March meeting was not legitimate on procedural grounds, including that inadequate notice was given to the broader W&amp;J group. They argue that the sitting fees were not a \u201cmonetary benefit\u201d but a \u201cbona fide reimbursement for travel, accommodation or expenses related to attending a meeting or negotiation\u201d. The four were therefore entitled to retain the $16,000, they submitted. They argued a W&amp;J meeting in April attended by 340 people claiming an interest in native title in the area scrapped any resolutions taken by the previous meeting. Lawyers for Burragubba\u2019s group allege that the April meeting was invalid, in part because it allowed Indigenous people who were not even W&amp;J to vote. \u201cNumerous persons voting at the 16 April 2016 meeting were not members of the W&amp;J native title claim group,\u201d they alleged in court papers. \u201cMany persons voting had never been to a prior W&amp;J claim group meeting, and had no recorded apical ancestor.\u201d The lawyers for Fisher, Gyemore, Tilley and Johnson Jr in court papers filed before the hearing did not directly address these allegations. The four are represented by Queensland South Native Title Service, which is handling the W&amp;J native title claim over traditional lands including the proposed site of the Carmichael mine in north Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin, west of Bowen. Indigenous consent looms as crucial to Adani\u2019s plans. Without it, banks that subscribe to the equator principles would be obliged to withhold finance and state government approvals could be subject to further challenge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
