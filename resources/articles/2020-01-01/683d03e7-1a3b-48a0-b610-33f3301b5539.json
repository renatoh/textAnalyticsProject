Looks like someone has planted a whoopee cushion inside the arena and it keeps going off making a \u2018poooooop\u2019 sound. Crowd laugh, Bingham not happy,\u201d tweeted BBC journalist Shamoon Hafez. The match between Ali Carter and Bingham was briefly halted early in the fifth frame, with referee Brendan Moore asking somebody in the crowd to \u201cstop that now, please\u201d. Moore and Bingham sought out the perpetrator, who was quickly removed from the venue \u2013 but not before a number of fart noises had caused much mirth inside Alexandra Palace. \u201cI think it could be someone with a whoopee cushion,\u201d Dennis Taylor said on the BBC\u2019s commentary. \u201cNot very funny at all.\u201d Bingham did not see the funny side either, with Moore saying that the noises were the \u201csame thing as the other day\u201d. A YouTube prank site has claimed responsibility for planting a \u201cfart box\u201d in the Alexandra Palace crowd earlier this week. The 2015 world champion didn\u2019t let the incident put him off his stride and, after trailing 7-5, he won four frames in a row and sealed victory with his first century of the tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
