The broadcaster and naturalist said his series Blue Planet 2, which detailed the effect of plastics on the ocean, had had an extraordinary effect. \u201cNow this great festival has gone plastic-free,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is more than a million bottles of water have not been drunk by you in plastic. Thank you! Thank you! \u201cThe ocean covers two-thirds of this planet of ours \u2026 the land only covers one third of the globe. There are seven great continents on which we human beings live. Each of them has its own marvellous creatures \u2013 birds and mammals, animals of all kinds. Each of them has its own glory, each of them has its own problems.\u201d A huge roar greeted the environmentalist and television presenter as he took to the stage in the afternoon to the sound of whale noises being played out on the speakers. He told the audience the sea creature noises were from Blue Planet 2. \u201cThere was one sequence that everyone seems to remember, that showed what plastic has done to the creatures in the ocean. It has an extraordinary effect.\u201d Adrian Lake, a wine merchant from Henley, said Attenborough\u2019s appearance had brought a tear to his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s such an iconic figure,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid Attenborough is the voice of the world\u2019s creatures and we need to join him in being that voice also.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just a legend,\u201d said Ian Simmons, from near Bath. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see him and all the young people taking notice of him. The way Glastonbury has done the plastic-free thing has been amazing. When you look around you hardly see any plastic, which is what we have to do, obviously.\u201d Georgia Spence watched Attenborough\u2019s speech with her friends Nicola Mitchinson and Dean Cousins, all in their 20s. \u201cMy friends weren\u2019t going to come to the Pyramid stage, but when they heard Attenborough was speaking, they changed their minds,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking out for the people of the future,\u201d added Cousins. Clouds and cool winds brought a reprieve after the 30C heat of Saturday, when the festival had to put out a statement to reassure attendees the site was not going to run out of water. Showers were shut off in order to preserve water and long queues formed at taps. The festival said 27 people had called for assistance because of heat-related problems. \u201cThere is not a water shortage at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. Our supply is running as normal,\u201d a statement said. \u201cAs always in hot weather, demand for water has increased, so we have put in place the usual restrictions on staff and guest showers and the limited number of public showers.\u201d On stage, Saturday night\u2019s headliners, the Killers, turned up the temperature with an impressive set that included appearances from Pet Shop Boys \u2013 who played Always on My Mind and duetted on Human \u2013 and Johnny Marr, who came on to the Pyramid stage to perform a version of the Smiths\u2019 This Charming Man. The band \u2013 who first headlined the festival in 2004 \u2013 got a five-star review from the Guardian\u2019s Alexis Petridis who said: \u201cFrom the opening moment, every song arrives strafed with lasers or pyrotechnics or confetti cannons.\u201d He said there was \u201csomething impressively relentless about their set: it never lags, there are no longueurs\u201d. Sunday\u2019s lineup included Kylie Minogue in the \u201clegends\u201d slot, followed by Miley Cyrus making her Glastonbury debut. Emily Eavis praised Friday night\u2019s headliner, Stormzy, who played a well-received Pyramid stage set that including guest appearances from Chris Martin and fellow UK rapper Dave. \u201cIt was a huge moment for us, up there with the all-time greatest Glastonbury headline performances,\u201d she said. \u201cThe atmosphere was incredible, but then it has been since the gates opened.\u201d Stormzy performed in a stabproof vest adorned with a union jack, designed by the street artist Banksy and seen as a political statement on knife crime and police cuts in the UK. Earlier on Saturday, Janet Jackson played an afternoon set that saw her race through her biggest hits, including What Have You Done for Me Lately? and Control, while the Chemical Brothers \u2013 who have now headlined at the festival five times \u2013 topped the Other stage with a maximalist production that climaxed with their 1997 hit Block Rockin\u2019 Beats. Elsewhere hip-hop icons the Wu-Tang Clan closed the West Holts stage and Liam Gallagher played an early evening set on the Pyramid stage, running through Oasis classics including Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Star and (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory. Eavis also commented on the festival\u2019s plastic-free approach, which was introduced this year and meant that single-use plastics were not sold on site. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think that there are 1m fewer plastic bottles for the planet to deal with because we\u2019ve stopped selling them. I think people are really starting to understand how important it is to treat the land with respect, and to stop living a disposable lifestyle.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
