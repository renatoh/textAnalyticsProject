The Players Championship, as is common, will be afforded a Sunday sprint finish. Only bold, or reckless, gamblers may pick a winner. Woods opted against any post-round media duties, as is his prerogative, after signing for a third-round 75. The stance, and his on-course demeanour, offered insight into his agitated state of mind. Woods made double bogey on two par fives \u2013 both on the front nine \u2013 in the same round for the first time in his PGA Tour career. At three over par, he will exit Sawgrass before the battle for the trophy really gets under way. That race could conceivably involve more than 20 players. Big names are prominent among them \u2013 Sergio Garc\u00eda, Adam Scott, Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Rory McIlroy \u2013 but the strength of the Players\u2019 field means it would be folly to ignore others. This event can, after all, lay legitimate claim to housing the finest character list in golf. For now, Chris Kirk leads the way at ten under par. Garc\u00eda and Scott have the advantage of having triumphed here before. The Spaniard\u2019s Saturday 67 was his finest round of the week, moving him to eight under par. And yet, discussion around Garc\u00eda, depressingly, seems to involve where he went wrong; namely on the greens. \u201cIn a way I am a little surprised that I am where I am the way I feel, because I feel like I left a lot of shots out there,\u201d Garc\u00eda explained. \u201cBut at the same time I guess I\u2019ve always said that this is one of my favourite courses. I feel like I can do well here, even without being full on with my putting, because it\u2019s a ball-striker\u2019s golf course. \u201cSo, if you can hit a lot of greens, the greens are small, so if you are hitting greens you usually have birdie chances. And I\u2019m usually fairly good at that. \u201cObviously I am excited. It\u2019s always exciting to be up there but at the same time, obviously, you look back at these first three days and I feel like I easily left on average three shots out there every round. You cannot think what could have been, but it is what it is. It\u2019s as simple as that. And I have just got to deal with it and try to do the best with what I have and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d Garc\u00eda arrived at Ponte Vedra Beach with three putters. One has remained in his house, another consigned to a bin in a fit of pique after Friday\u2019s round. He remains that kind of individual, who can routinely offer the impression that he does not fully believe in his own ability to win on any given week. The irony is that plenty of others do. \u201cI think Sergio is hard on himself,\u201d said McIlroy, a Ryder Cup team-mate of Garc\u00eda. \u201cI think you guys have probably experienced that over the past 15 or 20 years from covering him. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s a reason that he gets so down on himself, because he is so talented and he knows what he can achieve and he knows how good he can be. So we\u2019re all like that at times. I get frustrated with myself, but I feel like I can just sort of let it go maybe a little easier. Maybe that Latin blood in there sort of gets him a little fired up.\u201d McIlroy has endured his own problems with the putter, a trend that continued on day three. Yet at minus six he is firmly part of the discussion and with a chance of a second win in as many weeks; even on this, a course he has never fully warmed to. \u201cI played really good golf today,\u201d said the world No1 of his 70. \u201cI think I hit 13 or 14 fairways, I hit a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of chances. \u201cI have just been very frustrated on these greens, not seeing a lot of putts drop. So hopefully that will change a little, it can change tomorrow; but tee to green, it\u2019s right there and I just need to get a few to fall. I feel like I left a lot of shots out there. \u201cThe course is a little more gettable maybe, but it\u2019s firming up. I would like to see the greens a little firmer tomorrow again. I think that firm greens definitely separate the field. I would like to see firm greens. I feel, like, because it\u2019s been quite receptive this week that\u2019s what\u2019s made everyone so bunched together on the leaderboard.\u201d Ian Poulter made bogey on the 18th but still sits on the same aggregate as Mcllroy, with Scott and Watson also part of the six-under contingent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
