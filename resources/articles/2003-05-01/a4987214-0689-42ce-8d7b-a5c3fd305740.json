Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher finished more than a minute behind Michael Schumacher's winning Ferrari in fourth and fifth spots and never looked like challenging for top placings, either in qualifying or the race. BMW is currently deep in negotiations with Williams over the possibility of extending its engine supply partnership, which expires at the end of next season, but it wants to be convinced that the British team can raise their game to get on terms with Ferrari and McLaren-Mercedes. It was Williams, rather than McLaren, who had been tipped as the most likely contenders to take the fight to Ferrari this season. Instead they have so far fallen short and are languishing fourth in the constructors' championship behind McLaren, Ferrari and even Renault, whose young driver Fernando Alonso enlivened the Barcelona race with his superb second place. There is a view that BMW's engine is the most powerful in the field and handling deficiencies in the Williams FW25 are preventing it from demonstrating its true potential. \"We will continue beyond 2004 in formula one,\" said Mario Theissen, the BMW motorsport director. \"This has been agreed already by the board. So [what] we are talking about is not if, but how, to continue. The ultimate goal is to be competitive, to get into a position to win the championship.\" BMW is understood to have rejected the idea of building a formula one car of its own, but wants Williams to involve the engineering staff at its Munich headquarters in a technical collaboration. \"This is quite a demanding business and the only thing that makes it satisfying is to be successful at it,\" said Patrick Head, Williams' technical director. \"If you're not successful at it, it is frustrating, but there is no point throwing the toys out of the pram. \"The wonderful thing about grand prix racing is that one minute you make a mess of it and two weeks later you have another opportunity. I mean, OK, McLaren are a fantastic team and they are the team of the moment, but look at the mess they were in at Silverstone last year, making the most extraordinary mistakes with tyres going in all directions and drivers screaming and shouting. \"If changes have to be made you have to sit down and make those changes; different mechanisms and structures have to be set in order to overcome the problems and it is an activity which requires understanding and action.\" Meanwhile the Jaguar team have decided to retain Antonio Pizzonia, the 22-year-old Brazilian driver, as their second driver for the remainder of the season. Jaguar had been in talks with McLaren-Mercedes about the prospect of hiring McLaren's experienced test driver Alexander Wurz to replace him but decided they could not afford the Austrian's reputed \u00a31.25m release fee. Jacques Villeneuve reignited speculation over his future at BAR by criticising their reliability record. The former world champion hit out after limping out in Spain on the 12th lap with an electical fault. \"It's frustrating because it's the same story race after race,\" said the Canadian. \"It's a shame that we spend the weekend working on race strategy and set-up and we compromise our qualifying position to give us the best shot at the race, then we can't even make use of that work because we don't finish on a Sunday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
