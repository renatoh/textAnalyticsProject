The name is Cree for 'place of wonder', which it is. Vehicles are not allowed right into the mountain campsite so you won't find yourselves surrounded by noisy families in their huge RVs. It has fantastic views of the falls and excellent hikes nearby including the Iceline Trail and, for the less energetic, a pretty hike to Emerald Lake. Claire Sheret \u00b7 Go to Northern Vancouver Island. Rent a car and drive on the old logging roads to Cape Scott provincial park, about eight hours from Victoria. You'll find perhaps another 10 cars in the lot at the end of the road. From there, it's a 20km hike to the point and well worth the effort - it's like you've reached the end of the world. There are some nice inns in Port Hardy and other little towns around the area if you don't want to camp. Darin Ramsay \u00b7 Telegraph Cove on the north coast of Vancouver Island is remote and superb for whale and bear watching. Rob Bray \u00b7 I can highly recommend the western coast of Vancouver Island, around Tofino. Mountains, rain forests, beautiful beaches all within a couple of square miles, plus the wild Pacific surf. Best place I've ever been. Barbara O'Callaghan \u00b7 Two great opportunities in British Columbia are Salt Spring Island and Osoyoos. Salt Spring Island is easily accessible by Harbour Airn seaplane from the centre of Vancouver. The island has beautiful scenery and a thriving art scene. Osoyoos is a few hundred miles inland, on the US border, in Canada's only (very small) desert. The Sandy Beach Motel is a pleasant place to stay, on the (very shallow) Lake Osoyoos. The temperature is several degrees warmer here than elsewhere in BC, and it is in the middle of wine country. And don't miss Vancouver itself (especially the Dr Sun Yat Sen Garden, Stanley Park, Grouse Mountain, Tojo's sushi restaurant and the laid-back beachside neighbourhood of Kitsilano, easily accessible from Downtown by the charming False Creek Ferries). Mark Poole \u00b7 The youth hostel on Salt Spring Island is tiny and quiet, with tipis and tree houses to stay in as well as a handful of dorm beds. I can recommend a B&amp;B run by Shirley McIntyre (On Duck Creek B&amp;B), see saltspring.com/onduckcreek. She has an outdoor hot tub and an amazing home-baked breakfast. Kate Furneaux \u00b7 Don't miss Wells Gray Provincial Park in the westerns foothills of the Rockies. Stunning scenery and wildlife, great variety of walks/ activities and sights with mostly easy access by car and not as busy as the Rockies in August. Best start from Clearwater BC - very good tourist info on the main highway and choice of accommodation and services. Stay a few days and go on the boat trip (most of a day long) over Clearwater lake and be staggered by the site of millions of alpine flowers on Trophy Mountain meadows walk. If you fancy staying away from it all surrounded by nature, book a log cabin at Beaver Ranch about 20km from Clearwater (ntvalley.com/beaverranch).
