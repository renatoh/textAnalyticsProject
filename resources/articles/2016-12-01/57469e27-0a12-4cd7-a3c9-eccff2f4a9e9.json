Hartley could hardly have chosen a worse evening to revert from Saint to sinner, his deserved 58th-minute red card which was witnessed by Eddie Jones and his predecessor Stuart Lancaster, now a member of Leinster\u2019s management, The hooker, widely hailed as a key influence in England\u2019s unbeaten calendar year, had been on the field for six minutes when he was dismissed by the French referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s, having stiff-armed the Ireland back-row Sean O\u2019Brien from behind. With a bonus-point defeat leaving Northampton rooted to the foot of their European pool, Hartley\u2019s latest indiscretion not only left his club in the lurch but instantly shredded his growing reputation as a reformed character. Jim Mallinder, the Northampton director of rugby, made scant attempt to defend the indefensible, having seen his side concede five tries. \u201cIt\u2019s a strike to the head, we\u2019ve seen enough of them over the last few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a red card. He\u2019s been playing really well and leading England by example so it was disappointing that on returning from England after doing such a good job that that happens. I\u2019m also disappointed for the team. When you play a team like Leinster, you want all your best players playing and you need 15 players on the field.\u201d Mallinder expects Hartley to receive a hefty ban, with the top-end sanction for striking being eight weeks. With England kicking off the Six Nations against France in eight weeks\u2019 time a lengthy suspension would leave Hartley extremely short of rugby even if a stern-faced Jones is merciful and opts not to relieve him of the armband. It is all too reminiscent of Hartley\u2019s dark days, with his sending off in the 2013 Premiership final having cost him a place on that year\u2019s Lions tour. A subsequent citing and ban for butting Saracens\u2019 Jamie George also scuppered his 2015 World Cup prospects but that seemed ancient history as he helped guide England to 13 Test wins this year, including a grand slam. One moment of madness has propelled him back into the doghouse once more. The trigger for this latest career implosion may or may not have been Northampton\u2019s decision to start Hartley on the bench. Tom Wood, the Saints\u2019 captain, was among those who felt it might have been a factor. \u201cI can only assume he is trying to make an impact and be positive,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for him but my impression is that he\u2019s on the bench, he\u2019s eager, it\u2019s a big European night and he wants to make an impact. Contact to the head is such a big directive at the minute there was only ever going to be one decision. I don\u2019t want to talk too much about Dylan himself but as a club the discipline is becoming an issue.\u201d Wood was also scathing about his side\u2019s performance, with Leinster almost embarrassingly dominant in the first quarter. \u201cWe\u2019re lacking some belief, some togetherness and some identity. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re together at the minute. We spoke all week about having a big start and coming out of the blocks but we were just flat. We stood and watched them for 20 minutes.\u201d It rounded off a truly gruesome week for Northampton, still under fire for their handling of George North\u2019s latest head knock against Leicester last week. The furore refuses to go away, with Mallinder now conceding the Wales wing, who has been told to rest for two weeks, may have been concussed after all: \u201cAt the time of the incident our medics, from the views that they could see and speaking to George, believed George was not concussed. On reviewing the other views they recognised that he was, or probably was, and therefore would have probably done things differently.\u201d The findings of the specially convened three-man panel will be fascinating and there could soon be calls for a wide-ranging inquest into Northampton\u2019s underwhelming season. The game had barely started when a slick sequence of Leinster phases ended with Garry Ringrose racing in unopposed under the posts and, despite the premature loss of Joey Carbery, the luminous-shirted visitors made the black-clad Saints look horribly sluggish. With Devin Toner, Tadhg Furlong, Jack McGrath, Sean O\u2019Brien and Jamie Heaslip also lending a formidable edge up front and Rob Kearney imperious at the back, Northampton were thankful to be only 10-3 down at half-time and could hardly believe it when a nice long ball from J J Hanrahan released Ahsee Tuala to score wide on the right. They reckoned without further Leinster tries from O\u2019Brien, Rory O\u2019Loughlin, Jamison Gibson-Park and Isa Nacewa, the last three following Hartley\u2019s dismissal. In addition to letting down club and country, the hooker was also guilty of overshadowing Lancaster\u2019s triumphant return to English rugby soil.
