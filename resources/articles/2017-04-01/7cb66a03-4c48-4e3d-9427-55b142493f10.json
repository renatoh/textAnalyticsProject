It also serves as a reminder that he is still learning his trade. This season, with Saracens incurring a number of injuries at second row, the 22-year-old Itoje has been calling the lineout for the first time in his fledgling career. Considering his development over the past two years there would not seem room for another string on his bow but Mark McCall has been suitably impressed and Eddie Jones saw fit to task Itoje with that responsibility in Dublin. It must be said that it was he who was beaten to the ball by Ireland\u2019s Peter O\u2019Mahony in the dying stages of England\u2019s defeat, but since returning to Saracens he has continued apace in victories over Glasgow, Bath and Harlequins. \u201cI always wanted to know how to do it. I want to be the roundest player I can. Having the ability to do this definitely strengthens your arsenal,\u201d Itoje says. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, when you have experienced callers in front of you, to get the opportunity. Now that I\u2019ve had a couple of months doing it, I\u2019ve found it tough, challenging, but I\u2019ve enjoyed it and whenever I get the opportunity in the future I\u2019ll take it. Before the Six Nations I hadn\u2019t had much calling time under my belt, but it\u2019s something I\u2019d been practising whilst I trained; shadowing some of the senior callers at the club. When the time came it was good for me.\u201d That aforementioned lost lineout seemed to be affirmation for those who believe Itoje has levelled out this season; that, since moving to the No6 jersey during the Six Nations, his development has slowed. McCall staunchly disagrees. \u201cSome people will look at his contributions in games and his contributions aren\u2019t easy to see all the time,\u201d the Saracens director of rugby says. \u201cYou get the odd massive tackle, the odd carry, but he contributes in so many other ways. I think he\u2019s taken his game to another level and in the last couple of weeks he\u2019s been as good as anybody for us. \u201cI went in to see our personal development manager to say how good he had been in training and he told me about the essay he had sent over for his dissertation, which is apparently incredible as well. This is a kid who knows what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s so diligent about everything he does. People listen to him when he talks. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s competing with himself not to have a dip. He sets a phenomenal example.\u201d Should George Kruis return from a knee injury for Saracens against Northampton on Sunday, it is likely that he will resume lineout duties. During the Six Nations Jones described Kruis as his best set\u2011piece lock and if all four of England\u2019s second\u2011rows do not make the Lions squad \u2013 though there is every chance that they will \u2013 Kruis\u2019s encounter with Courtney Lawes this weekend may prove pivotal. \u201cGeorge is a genuinely quality player, he adds a lot of value to the team, a lot of nous, he\u2019s one of the leaders and a big character in the team, so it\u2019s going to be good to have him back,\u201d Itoje says. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy playing with him again, it\u2019s been a while. A healthy George is a healthier Saracens. His lineout work is pretty special. Not only that, he\u2019s vocal around the pitch, communicates well. He\u2019s one of the standard bearers, he adds general value to the team. \u201cAnd Courtney is awesome, an incredible player and I really enjoyed playing with him during the Six Nations. He\u2019s very athletic, very physical, a good ball carrier, he\u2019s a top player. But George is also a great player.\u201d Inevitably with Itoje, the conversation turns to his academic life. He is guarded as to exactly when his summer exams are but confirms they will not clash with a Lions tour for which that only injury will prevent him being selected. His essay, for the record, was \u201con whether geography constrained Africa\u2019s development\u201d. The conclusion? \u201cYes.\u201d And if he does not recall the 2005 tour, what is his best Lions memory? \u201cIt was in South Africa \u2013 that was the first tour I was interested in,\u201d Itoje says. \u201cMy interest in 2013 was even more profound. I had been playing rugby for a couple of years then, it was a great tour. But the thing that stands out for me is Ugo Monye\u2019s try [in 2009]. To see him run down the wing, intercept and celebrate \u2013 it was good, to see a fellow Nigerian do that for the Lions was nice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
