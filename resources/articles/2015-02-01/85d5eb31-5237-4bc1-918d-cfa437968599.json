Nearly three years to the day after the Florida teen was killed, the US Justice Department on Tuesday announced that it has closed its investigation into the fatal encounter and will not bring a civil rights charge against the gunman, George Zimmerman. Benjamin Crump, the family\u2019s lawyer, told the Guardian that Martin\u2019s parents were too distressed to address the media publicly on Tuesday. In a statement released through the attorney, Martin\u2019s family said they are \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the findings, but thanked the DoJ for an \u201cextensive and thorough investigation into the killing of our son\u201d. \u201cWe remain poised to do everything in our power to help eradicate senseless violence in our communities, because we don\u2019t want any other parent to experience the unexplainable loss we have endured,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe will never, ever forget what happened to our son, Trayvon, and will honor his memory by working tirelessly to make the world a better place.\u201d Crump said they do not intend to file a civil suit against Zimmerman. Instead he said they will focus on the foundation established in their son\u2019s honor. \u201cThey are steadfast in their decision to carry on the legacy of Trayvon,\u201d he said. Martin, who would have turned 20 on 5 February, was shot and killed by Zimmerman on 26 February 2012. Zimmerman, who has said he shot Martin in self-defense, was acquitted of second-degree murder charges in July 2013. Federal charges would have required the DoJ to prove the killing was motivated by race. The DoJ informed Martin\u2019s family and lawyers of its conclusion on Tuesday afternoon, the family lawyer confirmed. \u201cThe death of Trayvon Martin was a devastating tragedy,\u201d said US attorney general Eric Holder in a statement. \u201cIt shook an entire community, drew the attention of millions across the nation, and sparked a painful but necessary dialogue throughout the country. \u201cThough a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution cannot be met under the circumstances here, this young man\u2019s premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface. We, as a nation, must take concrete steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.\u201d A team of federal investigators conducted 75 witness interviews and reviewed the contents of relevant electronic devices, the department said. The investigation also hired an independent biomechanical expert to assess Zimmerman\u2019s descriptions of the struggle and the shooting. Investigators were specifically looking at whether Zimmerman\u2019s decision to use force against the teen was based on his race. The department found \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to support this, it said. \u201cAlthough the department has determined that this matter cannot be prosecuted federally, it is important to remember that this incident resulted in the tragic loss of a teenager\u2019s life,\u201d acting assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. \u201cOur decision not to pursue federal charges does not condone the shooting that resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin and is based solely on the high legal standard applicable to these cases.\u201d Martin was killed as he was walking back from a convenience store, where he went to buy a pack of Skittles and an iced tea. The 17-year-old was wearing a gray hoodie pulled over his head when Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, confronted him. Martin\u2019s sweatshirt became a national symbol of the discrimination young men of color face. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense after a tussle with the teen, giving rise to a debate about the state\u2019s controversial stand-your-ground law. Reacting to the news that the investigation was now closed, Don West, a Florida-based attorney representing Zimmerman, told The Guardian that his client was \u201cpleased and relieved\u201d by the decision. \u201cWe are certainly relieved [by the findings] but not surprised by them. This is always what we expected to ultimately be the decision by the DoJ.\u201d West said he hoped the nation\u2019s leaders and the public will respect the criminal justice process, and accept \u201cthat this was not a race-based event, that it was not motivated by hatred. That it was a tragedy.\u201d He added: \u201cI know he (Zimmerman) would like to live a normal life - or at least try to live a normal life, but given his level of notoriety I suppose that will be hard. It will be an uphill battle.\u201d Since the 2013 trial, Zimmerman has had several brushes with the law, including an arrest in January on charges of aggravated assault. Those charges were later dropped. Tuesday\u2019s announcement comes at an uncomfortable time for the nation, still grappling with the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York. The deaths of black men at the hands of white police officers have touched off protests that spread across the country, reigniting a national debate about race and policing. The DoJ has opened civil rights investigations into both cases. The Trayvon Martin case also inspired rallies in hundreds of US cities, and raised the issue of racial discrimination. Martin\u2019s death even drew comments from Barack Obama. \u201cTrayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,\u201d the US president said. \u201cAnd when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there\u2019s a lot of pain around what happened, I think it\u2019s important to recognise that the African American community is looking at this through a set of experiences and a history that doesn\u2019t go away. \u201cThere are very few African American men in this country who haven\u2019t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
