The internet auctioneer's UK site yesterday responded to a report in the Guardian and removed all listings offering tickets following an extension of legislation that made such sales illegal. However, the company states that there is no jurisdiction over tickets advertised on its sites based in other countries and it will permit auctions to continue on eBay.com and affiliated non-UK websites. That does not satisfy Fifa, football's world body, since all such sales are in breach of the terms and conditions of the tickets. \"Any attempt to re-sell tickets without the approval of the organisation committee of the World Cup will be deemed ticket touting [or] black-market trading, and will result in cancellation of the ticket,\" said Fifa. World Cup tickets contain a chip that stores personal information of the purchaser. If this does not tally with the bearer's, it can be withdrawn at the turnstiles. Fifa intends to forward to the police any information it has of sales that were processed by eBay after the introduction of the new law at midnight on Sunday. EBay insists that no such sales went through on Monday despite several listings remaining on its site. A listing on the US eBay.com yesterday warned: \"Ticket scalpers steal other people's eBay accounts and try to sell you World Cup tickets that do not exist.\" The listing went on to describe dozens of fraudulent ticket offers. Ebay says its Safety Center contains alerts agains such abuses. Fifa intends to pursue the matter. \"We are in permanent contact with our lawyers on this issue,\" said a spokesman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
