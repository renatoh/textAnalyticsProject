An artist and architectural historian, Newton, 59, grew up here before heading south to work in London as a topographical artist in the early 1980s. He\u2019s returned to launch Magnificent Liverpool, idiosyncratic tours of a city that\u2019s captivated him since childhood. \u201cThere\u2019s still an outdated view of Liverpool which dates back to the Toxteth riots and declining docks of the 1980s,\u201d says Newton, \u201cbut the city has changed hugely since then. The architecture is spectacular \u2013 it has the most listed buildings of any city outside London \u2013 and the vibrant indigenous culture is open to all. You can go on tours themed around football or the Beatles, but I wanted to offer something that draws on my background as an architectural historian and a Liverpudlian. I\u2019ve known this city all my life, now I\u2019ve come back to share it with other people. \u201cMy father worked at the Liverpool Echo,\u201d Newton continues, as we plunge in to the midday bustle of Water Street. \u201cHe\u2019d bring unprinted newspaper home for me to draw my favourite buildings on \u2013 so my love of architecture began when I was a child.\u201d Newton knows the city well. During the following two days my personalised itinerary (you can book tours for groups or individuals lasting from an hour to a day or more) takes in landmarks brought to life by Newton\u2019s commentary:, \u201ca dusting of dates\u201d spiced with anecdotes. \u201cEverything starts with the port,\u201d he tells me, gesturing towards the fast-flowing, silt-brown Mersey. It was King John who declared the natural harbour a borough in 1207. Coastal, Irish and European shipping was joined in the 17th century by trade from the American colonies. By the 1700s, warehouses and counting houses lined the docks. Tobacco, rum and cotton \u2013 commodities of slave-powered trade \u2013 were disgorged, while salt, soap and machinery were dispatched to the rest of the world. You can see that prosperity writ large in the business district. Banks and offices \u2013 gothic, neoclassical \u2013 line the pavements like palaces. The stamp of distinguished architects is everywhere: John Wood the Elder; Charles Cockerell; James Wyatt, who put the finishing touches to the Town Hall; Herbert Rowse, whose art deco ventilation shaft for the Mersey Tunnel broods over the city like a prop from Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis. \u201cThese architects created a look that\u2019s unique: it\u2019s what gives Liverpool its extraordinary character,\u201d says Newton enthusiastically. Innovation was encouraged. I learn that Liverpool has some of the country\u2019s earliest fireproofed buildings, steel and stone structures which paved the way for skyscrapers, such as the Edwardian Royal Liver Building, with its curious bird sculptures perched on top: \u201cHeron, cormorant, no one knows. They\u2019re a local mystery.\u201d Alleys were clad in white tiles to bounce light into adjacent buildings. Without Newton I would have missed Oriel Chambers, one of the world\u2019s first buildings to feature a metal-framed, glass curtain wall \u2013 so avant-garde that The Builder at the time condemned it as \u201ca vast abortion\u201d. \u201cWhen I was a child all these buildings were filthy, I used to think that everything was built out of black stone,\u201d Newton says as we meander down to the Pier Head. Now all has been scrubbed and spruced up. You can have tea in a double-decker, pose for a photo with a statue of the Fab Four or take a cruise in a colourful ferry designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake. The Tate and Museum of Liverpool are also here, symbolising the changes which have transformed the city since Newton left: \u201cLiverpool in the 70s was a bit grim and depressed. The docks had closed, buildings were run down. So it\u2019s wonderful to see a city putting its money where its cultural life is; week by week I see more tourists visiting.\u201d Some things have gone, like the gentlemen\u2019s outfitters with their glass-fronted cabinets and hovering assistants. But independent businesses prevail. \u201cThere are very few chains and lots of small music venues and shops. It\u2019s all part of the individualistic Liverpool spirit.\u201d Caf\u00e9 Tabac on Bold Street, opened in 1974, exudes retro cool. The vegetarian Egg Caf\u00e9, a time-warp of red and purple walls, is packed with pensioners and students. We flit through the Georgian-built Bluecoat, once a charitable school, now an airy gallery, caf\u00e9 and music studio. Newton\u2019s tour also takes in untouched pubs such as Ye Hole in ye Wall or the tiny Globe, where we\u2019re invited to linger. \u201cLiverpool\u2019s like that,\u201d says Newton. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly friendly place.\u201d As Liverpudlians prospered they swapped dockside living for the cleaner air of the town\u2019s upper reaches. The next day we stroll through Ropewalks, its warehouses converted into lively caf\u00e9s and sleek architects\u2019 offices, to the Georgian quarter. Newton\u2019s favourite is Percy Street, derelict in the 1970s (the Toxteth riots happened nearby) now a \u201cLittle Edinburgh\u201d of restored stone townhouses. William Gladstone lived on Rodney Street \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s Harley Street \u2013 as did the Irish photographer Edward Chambr\u00e9 Hardman, famous for his atmospheric shots of the Mersey Tunnel. The Hardmans\u2019 House is now a museum with his clawfoot bath for processing in the cellar, and a studio filled with props: pillars for sedate society portraits, leopard skins for racier poses. All this went on in the shadow of Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s cathedral on St James\u2019s Mount. Work started in 1904 and it took 74 years to build the longest cathedral in Britain. \u201cThe less enthusiastic call it Odeon Gothic,\u201d Newton whispers as we enter the cavernous interior, enlivened by the bright Craigie Aitchison painting in a chapel. Call me shallow but I prefer Frederick Gibberd\u2019s 1960s \u201cCatholic Cathedral\u201d, a perky wigwam of a building where light floods through John Piper windows and the side chapels feel like contemporary art galleries. Our penultimate stop is Henry Bohn Books, a friendly secondhand book shop (opposite the Walker Art Gallery) where locals converge to chat about art, politics and football. I pick up a copy of Pevsner\u2019s guide to Liverpool which devotes a chapter to our final destination. St George\u2019s Hall is a sprawling, 19th-century complex of law courts and concert halls replete with columns, marble and early air-conditioning system. As we leave, Newton points to doors emblazoned with the letters SPQL: the Senate and People of Liverpool. A boastful spin on the SPQR badge of ancient Rome, here\u2019s Scouse chutzpah at its most brazen \u2013 and wonderful. Where to eat Bunch, a cosy wine bar with tasting rooms specialising in natural wines (bottles from \u00a310). Salt House Bacaro, bustling and central, generous small plates with a decent wine list (starters from \u00a33.95). Hanover Street Social is a lively, centrally located restaurant with brasserie-style food (starters from \u00a35.95). Set in a converted townhouse, Wreckfish\u2019s robust dishes include cauliflower risotto or pork osso bucco, (starters from \u00a36). For tea, Cuthbert\u2019s is a cheerful tearoom serving classics like lemon drizzle and red velvet cakes. Cow &amp; Co is a two-floor design shop and cafe in a Scandi-style setting. Where to stay Hope Street Hotel (doubles from \u00a3103) is central, comfortable and near the Philharmonic Hall, theatres and museums. Aloft Liverpool (doubles from \u00a371) is a modern, well-equipped central hotel in a Grade II-listed building. The Nadler\u2019s (doubles from \u00a353) white walls and exposed brickwork set the tone for this central, well-priced hotel (there is no restaurant). The Richmond (doubles from \u00a375), a 10-minute walk from the main sites, has both rooms and apartments with a brasserie and restaurant. What to see The Museum of Liverpool is an intriguing, presented introduction to the city\u2019s history with temporary exhibitions of local culture (Double Fantasy: John &amp; Yoko is on until 22 April 2019). The Walker Art Gallery has modern British gems, damask-lined rooms of Old Masters and artworks dating back to the 13th century. At the World Museum, dip in to the Planetarium, Egyptian Gallery or bug house at the city\u2019s oldest museum. From tobacco to the Titanic, unravel the city\u2019s seafaring story at the Merseyside Maritime Museum and International Slavery Museum, both set near the Albert Docks. The Hardmans\u2019 House is where society photographer Edward Chambre Hardman lived and worked until the 1950s. The Bluecoat is an inviting gallery and craft shop plus cafe set in a Georgian charitable school. Williamson Tunnels is a fascinating underground network of tunnels created by eccentric philanthropist Joseph Williamson. Way to go For more information, go to Visit Liverpool.
