He sits in the corner, refuses to budge and steals the show from anyone who wants to talk about the game. Brian Lara's comeback? Er, excuse me, the ICC technical committee blah blah blah. Lance Klusener's brainstorm? I'm sorry, but Justice Albie Sachs etc etc. Sanath Jayasuriya's fireworks? Bah, that independent security firm doesn't know its arse from its grumble moan blather. At some point today, we should know for certain whether England will play in Harare on Thursday. But whatever happens, the pub bore will be left with plenty of ammunition. The list of governing bodies who at one stage or another have deserved to hang their heads in shame is already long. And it just got longer. According to a report in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, the UCBSA (United Cricket Board of South Africa) has told the ECB that South Africa could pull out of their trip to England this summer if England don't play in Harare. Of all the various offences committed by men in suits over the last few weeks, this is the most cowardly. South Africa should know all about the power sport can wield over politics - it's one of the reasons apartheid is now a historical footnote. To attempt to punish England for trying to find their way out of this moral maze is a disgrace. England are in turmoil. Their players are emotional wrecks. They have received death threats (and however serious the Sons and Daughters of Zimbabwe are, a death threat is not to be sneered at). Their World Cup is almost over before it has begun. Yet - whether they reach the Super Six or not - they can still emerge from this mess with credit by sticking to their guns while all about them are firing theirs. Yesterday, Andy Flower and Henry Olonga - two Zimbabweans, one white and one black - issued a statement saying they would be wearing black armbands throughout the competition in protest at the \"death of democracy\". It could cost them their careers, but it was easily the most dignified moment of the World Cup so far. Now if you'll excuse me, there's some cricket to watch. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o QUOTE OF THE WEEK \"I still feel that when it is dished out to them, they don't handle it too well.\" - Viv Richards spots a chink in the Australian armoury. They don't like being sledged. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o SILLY POINT: A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE By the time you read this - and the Spin thanks you for sticking it out - Australia's game with Pakistan will be well under way. Australia might even be well on top. But don't be fooled. Not for one second. Because the Australians are officially in disarray, and that was before Shane Warne was sent home for losing weight with suspicious haste. Just ask Waqar Younis, the Pakistan captain. \"The Australians are panicking,\" announced Waqar in the pre-match build-up as a roomful of journalists wondered whether Australia had accidentally sent a team of rugby league players to South Africa and had only just realised their error. \"We must cash on it to have a cracking start in the tournament.\" What Waqar actually meant soon became clear when Rashid Latif took up the attack. \"Dropping Steve Waugh tantamounts to dropping the cup,\" said Latif, cunningly subverting Waugh's apocryphal remark to Herschelle Gibbs in 1999. But it wasn't just the absence of Waugh that tickled Latif's fancy: Darren Lehmann is still serving his suspension for losing it against the Sri Lankans, and Michael Bevan is injured. \"They will play with four top batsmen and an inexperienced fifth in Jimmy Maher,\" pointed out Latif, triumphantly, \"and that could be the crucial factor.\" The last time the two sides met in the World Cup, Pakistan flopped horribly in the 1999 final at Lord's. Ricky Ponting, the Australian one-day captain, is hoping for an instant replay, but Waqar is prepared. \"We, too, have a plan to tame them,\" he said with a wink and a nudge. When no one asked him what the plan was, he elaborated anyway. \"If he [Ponting] reminds me of the Lord's final, I will remind him of the Super Challenge series last year which we won on their home turf.\" The same roomful of journalists scratched their heads and tried to remember exactly what Super Challenge series Waqar was going on about. But it was no good. Still, Australia were in disarray. And for the time being, that was all that mattered. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o COW CORNER: HUNKS \"Everything about him is perfect - the hair, the twinkly eyes, the luscious lashes, the strong jaw, the lean body.\" The Spin on a Friday night after a few pints at the local karaoke bar/Mongolian eatery? Alas, no. These are the qualities attributed to the New Zealand captain, Stephen Fleming, who came second in a poll in Johannesburg's Star newspaper which asked women readers to help pick a World Hunks XI. Sickened by the sexism of it all, and in no way piqued not to have rated so much as a mention, the Spin read on. \"When he smiles, women swoon,\" continued the song of praise. \"One look at him and we immediately want to have his children.\" First place in this Hall of Shame, however, belongs to Wasim Akram. Apparently, Wasim is endowed with \"slightly louche, bad-boy looks which promise delightful wickedness\". Other players in this dubious pantheon of pulchritude include Bangladesh's Alok Kapali (\"delicious dimples, kissable lips\"), Makhaya Ntini (\"dips and curves in the most extraordinary places\"), Corey Collymore (\"great bone structure\"), Zaheer Khan (\"depths to be plumbed\"), Brett Lee (\"blond bombshell\"), Rahul Dravid (\"women would relish being driven up The Wall\"), Chris Cairns (\"rugged, strong and macho\") and Sachin Tendulkar (\"small, perfectly formed package\"). Where, the Spin hears you cry, are all the Englishmen? Step forward Craig White. Now the English might not be everyone's cup of tea of present, but you have to ask what they have done to deserve the following sweeping generalisation from an Indian journalist. \"The inclusion of Craig White in the list is proof that there is no account for taste,\" he quips. \"Even though he was born in Australia, the 33-year-old looks like a typical Englishman.\" For once, the Spin is speechless. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o THE WEEK IN CRICKET England warm up for the World Cup with a five-wicket win over Eastern Province ...
