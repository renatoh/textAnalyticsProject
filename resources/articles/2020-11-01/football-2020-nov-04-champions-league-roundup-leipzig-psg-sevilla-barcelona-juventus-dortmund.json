Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side had the chance to double their lead from the spot but Di Mar\u00eda saw his penalty saved by Peter Gulacsi. Di Mar\u00eda and Moise Kean then had strikes ruled out for offside as the visitors dominated. PSG were punished for their profligacy when their former player Christopher Nkunku fired Leipzig level from the edge of the area in the 41st minute. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side went ahead just before the hour after Angeli\u00f1o\u2019s cross was handled by Presnel Kimpembe. Emil Forsberg, who had missed a golden first-half opportunity, made no mistake from the penalty spot. Idrissa Gueye was sent off for a second yellow card in the 68th minute, with Kimpembe also dismissed in stoppage time as PSG unravelled. The visitors, who were missing Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Mauro Icardi, now face a battle to qualify for the last 16 after taking three points from their first three games. Leipzig are level on six points with Manchester United, surprise 2-1 losers at Istanbul Basaksehir. In Group E, Sevilla fought back from two goals down to beat Krasnodar 3-2 despite Jes\u00fas Navas\u2019s first-half red card. Shapi Suleymanov\u2019s free-kick put the visitors ahead and Marcus Berg\u2019s penalty made it 2-0 after 20 minutes at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n. Ivan Rakitic\u2019s header got the hosts back on track but Navas was shown a straight red card for a reckless foul on Kristoffer Olsson just outside the penalty area. Rakitic hit the crossbar for Sevilla but they were heading for defeat until the Krasnodar defender Kaio passed the ball straight to Youssef En-Nesyri, who pulled Sevilla level. The Moroccan lashed home a second goal moments later to complete an extraordinary comeback, and keep Julen Lopetegui\u2019s side level with Chelsea at the top of the group, after the Blues\u2019 3-0 win against Rennes. In Group G, Barcelona and Juventus stayed on track for the knockout stages with victories over Dynamo Kyiv and Ferencvaros respectively. Bar\u00e7a made it three wins from three games but were far from convincing at the Camp Nou. Lionel Messi\u2019s early penalty gave them a half-time lead before G\u00e9rard Pique added a second from Ansu Fati\u2019s cross. The visitors were missing six players and five staff members because of Covid positives but made life difficult for Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. Dynamo had the ball in the net following a corner only for the goal to be ruled out for the ball into the box having gone out of play, but they did pull one back in the 75th minute. Viktor Tsygankov slid home on the rebound after Marc-Andre ter Stegen saved from Benjamin Verbic. Barcelona held on for the win. In Budapest, \u00c1lvaro Morata opened the scoring from Juan Cuadrado\u2019s cross in the seventh minute and then swept home Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s pass on the hour to put Juventus in control. Two howlers from the home goalkeeper Dense Dibusz allowed the substitute Paulo Dybala to get on the scoresheet, and then force Lasha Dvali to put through his own goal. Franck Boli scored a late consolation for the Hungarians. Erling Haaland scored twice as Dortmund climbed to the top of Group F with victory at Club Brugge. Haaland\u2019s two goals came after Thorgan Hazard\u2019s 14th-minute opener squirmed through Simon Mignolet\u2019s hands. Haaland turned in the rebound after Mignolet had saved his close-range header, and the Norwegian added another from Thomas Meunier\u2019s pass with barely half an hour played. Lucien Favre\u2019s side take on Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Felipe Caicedo earned a valuable point for Lazio at Zenit, sweeping home from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic\u2019s pass in the 82nd minute to cancel out Aleksandr Erokhin\u2019s first-half volley. Lazio had only 13 senior players available for the match amid a Covid-19 outbreak at the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
