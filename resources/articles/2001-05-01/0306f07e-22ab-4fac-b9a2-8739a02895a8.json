In the past four decades morale at Deepdale has at times reached not just low but subterranean. Given that they were flirting with bankruptcy 15 years ago it is astounding that today they are standing, somewhat light-headed, on the verge of football's Millionaires' Row. Yet that is the prize that awaits them in Cardiff this afternoon. Defeat of Bolton in the play-off final will see Preston granted membership of the tills-ringing Premiership, back in the big time at last. This glittering prospect would have seemed merely fool's gold in those dark long hours of chronic mismanagement and stacks of red bills. \"I call them the wilderness years. I came here as a boy to support Barnsley in 1970 and when I came back to Deepdale in 1994 it struck me that absolutely nothing had changed. The place was in a time warp,\" says the chairman Bryan Gray. \"The letters [we used to get] centred around things like potholes behind the old Town End and 'Could we fill them in please as our shoes are getting wet.' The mood in the town was one of utter disbelief.\" Look back even further and the situation was if anything bleaker. With Brian Kidd taking his first heavy-hearted steps into management, terraces crumbling and crowds plummeting below 3,500, Preston finished 91st in the league in 1986 and were reduced to applying to the Football League for re-election. Alan Kelly, the goalkeeper at the time, remembers that the club could not even get their floodlights to work properly. \"I was a 17-year-old kid and I can remember my second or third game, losing at home to Cambridge on a freezing night. The fans were in revolt and one supporter had a banner saying: 'Board out! Chairman out! Everyone out!' \"I was standing on the edge of my penalty area thinking, 'Welcome to Deepdale, mate', and I couldn't even see the middle of the pitch. The floodlights had been angled too far into the corners.\" Take a trip down Sir Tom Finney Way these days and it is clear that Preston are finally out of intensive care. In the club's main entrance a model of Deepdale 2002 invites admiring looks. By the start of next season the refurbishment will be three-quarters complete, with a new 6,000-seat Town End being opened. Work is then due to start on the Pavilion Stand next year. \"If we get to the Premiership we will have built a stand per division,\" says the chief executive Tony Scholes. It is, indeed, a remarkable metamorphosis. Managers are rarely invited to take over at successful clubs and when David Moyes was appointed 3 years ago Preston were floundering in the depths of the Second Division. \"There were a lot of people who didn't really want me in the job,\" he says. \"The fans wanted Ian Rush, Howard Kendall, a big-name manager. You could feel the scepticism.\" It is fortunate, therefore, that Moyes has a thick skin. Relegation was avoided and last year Preston won the Second Division. \"Every Tom, Dick and Harry was saying we would need to buy four or five players to avoid going straight back down but I was sure we were better than that,\" he says. This young and ambitious Scot is developing a reputation as one of the best managers of his generation, but his chairman's contribution should not be overlooked. It is seven years now since Gray, in his capacity as chief executive of the Preston-based heating company Baxi, attended a Business in the Community seminar hosted by the Prince of Wales. \"He challenged us to help our community and when I came away I spoke to a Preston supporter who told me how badly the club were doing. \"It was my moment of serendipity. I looked around and thought: 'This is meant to be.' The club obviously needed business skills and within six weeks the formalities were completed and we had drawn up a plan to return this club to the top end.\" Appointing Moyes was his masterstroke. Preston will have more than 30,000 supporters in Cardiff today. \"I've never known anything like this in the town,\" says the defender Rob Edwards. \"You just have to drive around and look at how many people are wearing Preston shirts. It's normally kids in Manchester United shirts but I can't remember seeing any for ages. People are proud to be associated with this club again.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
