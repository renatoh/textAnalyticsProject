The move follows the stabbing of a Kurdish asylum seeker last week, fuelling fears over vulnerable incomers obliged to move to communities where they have no ties. The Home Secretary is particularly worried about the scandal - first revealed in The Observer - of some private firms contracted to the dispersal scheme exploiting asylum seekers by providing slum housing. Although Blunkett insists he will not bow to calls to scrap the dispersal process, he has triggered an urgent review of the way it works, led by a senior civil servant. As part of a wider strategy, asylum seekers will also be urged to do voluntary work in order to reduce hostility from local communities - particularly in poorer areas where the refugees, unable to take paid work while their cases are considered, are sometimes derided as 'welfare scroungers'. Blunkett is keen that they be seen to give something back to society with more 'purposeful activity', such as helping clean up rundown estates. 'The Home Secretary has been concerned since taking office by some aspects of the way in which dispersal has been working on the ground and wants a rapid operational review to examine concerns that have been raised,' said a Home Office source. The Government will face further criticism this week over child refugees when the Refugee Council and Save the Children publish a report highlighting the plight of children separated from their parents. It is expected to reveal cases of children who have fallen through the net, ending up sharing accommodation with strangers and in some cases been detained in prison. 'We must never lose sight of the fact that they are children first and refugee children second,' said Fazil Kawani, of the Refugee Council. The review of the dispersal scheme, which has only been running since last April, will delight refugee groups. But questions will be raised because it is the second major rethink of immigration policy in a year, following the review of the voucher scheme. The dispersal inquiry will consider how effectively asylum seekers have been integrated, including a review of what support, such as healthcare, was offered; whether local authorities could be better notified of their arrival; and, crucially, tighter scrutiny of the contracts awarded to private firms for housing asylum seekers. It will report to Blunkett by October. Under the dispersal system established by Blunkett's predecessor Jack Straw, refugees are forced to move into designated 'clusters' in cities such as Liverpool, Hull and Glasgow, or lose money paid for their accommodation. It was set up following protests from local authorities in London and the South-East that they were overloaded. Last year The Observer revealed that refugees in Liverpool had been placed in blocks sold off by the council as unfit for their tenants. Documents were withheld and they were refused visitors, except by prior permission of the landlady. There were also reports of asylum seekers being dumped with local authorities unaware of their presence. The tacit acceptance that some private firms have failed to deliver adequate accommodation will also be seized on by opponents of Labour's drive towards greater private sector involvement in public services.
