Amid rumours his condition was far worse than doctors had admitted, Shlomo Mor-Yosef, the director of the Hadassah hospital, told reporters that Mr Sharon's brain was functioning without artificial support. The 77-year-old was rushed to Jerusalem from his ranch in the Negev desert last night after complaining that he felt unwell. He suffered a mild stroke last month, and the bleeding developed on the hour-long ambulance journey. Dr Mor-Yosef said a cerebral haemorrhage - also known as a bleeding stroke - had left him in a severe condition and Mr Sharon would be under anaesthetic and ventilated for at least another 48 hours as part of the treatment. His illness throws Israeli politics and diplomacy throughout the region into turmoil amid election campaigns for both the Palestinians and Israel. Ehud Olmert, Mr Sharon's deputy and the acting prime minister, told a meeting of the Israeli cabinet today that the prime minister's condition had put the country in \"a difficult situation that we are not accustomed to\". Israeli elections 'will take place as planned' Mr Sharon, who has for years been very overweight, had embarked on a flurry of political activity in recent months. He withdrew Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip in August, and then left the Likud party he founded over internal opposition to the plan. He set up a new centrist grouping with former Labour party rivals to contest a general election due to be held in March. His death or incapacitation would complicate hopes for the progress of the peace process with the Palestinians because a freshly-elected Sharon government was thought likely to withdraw from more settlements in the occupied territories. While polls have predicted victory for Mr Sharon's centrist party, an election without him would be a much more open race. Israel's attorney general, Meni Mazuz, today said the vote would take place as planned. In a separate development, the January 25 Palestinian parliamentary elections - in which Hamas are expected to make gains - were thrown into doubt when the independent electoral commission submitted a resignation letter to the president, Mahmoud Abbas, today. Mr Abbas, elected as the successor to Yasser Arafat last year, has already threatened to postpone the vote if Israel prevents Palestinians from voting in East Jerusalem. Two US envoys were scheduled to meet Mr Sharon today, apparently to urge Israel to reverse the ban. \"We hope that this will not affect what we had expected of the Israelis,\" said the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. If Mr Olmert delays making a decision on Jerusalem, \"it means the Palestinian election is going down\", he added. The Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, said Mr Sharon's condition was \"an event that will have an impact not only on Israel, but also the region\". Mr Sharon has been prominent in Israeli life for more than 50 years. He has played a part in every one of Israel's wars, and was injured in the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict. His career saw him became a controversial military leader in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon - during which pro-Israeli Christian militiamen massacred Palestinians in two Beirut refugee camps - and then the head of the hawkish Likud party. Tributes paid to 'man of courage' It is only over recent years, with his groundbreaking plan to withdraw from Gaza, that he has earned respect from all sides of the political spectrum. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, paid tribute today to Mr Sharon's \"great political courage\" and said his legacy was assured whether or not he survived. \"If one thinks back even a matter of five and a half years to the controversy which took place then,\" Mr Straw told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, \"and roll forward to the extraordinarily courageous and imaginative steps he's taken to withdraw Israel unilaterally from the Gaza and force settlements in the north of the West Bank to take on the settler movement [...] the effect he's already had is astonishing and I think it will be long-lasting, whenever it comes to an end.\" Doctors speculated on Israeli television that blood-thinning drugs administered to Mr Sharon over the past two weeks could have contributed to yesterday's major stroke. The US president, George Bush, praised Mr Sharon as \"a man of courage and peace\" and said he and the first lady, Laura Bush, were praying for his recovery. Palestinian militant factions reacted with glee to news of the Israeli prime minister's stoke. While the withdrawal from Gaza and some West Bank settlements may have positive consequences for the peace process, Mr Sharon's primary concern is with Israeli security, and he has taken an aggressive line against militant groups. \"The whole region will be better off with him absent,\" a Hamas statement said. \"Sharon was the one who carried out massacres and terrorism for decades against our people.\" Commentaries in the Arab media veered between criticism of Mr Sharon's hawkishness and praise for the Gaza withdrawal. \"If God wants an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement, then Sharon will not die,\" the Jordanian political analyst Labib Kamhawi told the Associated Press. \"There is no Israeli politician other than Sharon at this point who can implement peace.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
