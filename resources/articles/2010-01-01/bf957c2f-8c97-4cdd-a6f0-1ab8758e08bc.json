But organisers in Angola dismissed calls for the tournament to be abandoned because of security concerns and said the opening ceremony and first match would go ahead tomorrow as planned. The bloodshed represented the worst possible start to African sport's biggest year. The ripples were felt in South Africa, due to host the World Cup in just five months, where officials moved quickly to describe it as an \"isolated terrorist incident\". However, the separatist guerrilla group claiming responsibility said tonight it had repeatedly warned the footballing authorities that the territory was at war, and it would now strike again. \"This operation is only the start of a series of targeted actions that will continue,\" said Rodrigues Mingas, secretary general of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (Flec), which has fought for control of the northern enclave and its oil and diamond reserves for more than 40 years. Speaking from exile in France, Mingas added: \"We are in full action. The country is in a state of war so it's perilous for those who want to go to Cabinda.\" Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor was among the players trapped under their seats for up to half an hour as their bus was raked with gunfire. Togo's assistant coach, Amalete Abalo, and media officer, Stanislas Ocloo, were killed in the hail of bullets, the country's football federation said . The driver of the bus also died. Reserve goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale was evacuated to Johannesburg for medical treatment, where his condition was described as serious but stable. Seven other people suffered injuries. \"The Togolese government has decided to call back the team,\" Togolese minister Pascal Bodjona said. \"We could not continue the Cup of Nations in this dramatic situation. This was necessary because our players are in a state of shock and because we do not think the security that should have been placed around our players is giving the necessary guarantees.\" The judgment of the players, who are due to play Ghana on Monday, appeared unanimous. Shaken and tearful but unhurt, Adebayor, the captain, convened a team meeting on Friday night. He told the BBC World Service: \"I don't think they want to be at this tournament any more because they have seen their death already.\" Midfielder Alaixys Romao said the players were at the airport and ready to leave. \"We're waiting for the plane to return to Lom\u00e9,\" the Grenoble player told L'Equipe. \"We're also talking to the other teams in our group to try to convince them to boycott the competition, too.\" Togo's coach, Hubert Velud, said the authorities should seriously consider calling off the tournament. \"We can at least pose ourselves that question,\" Velud said. \"It's an act of barbarism while we are here to celebrate African football. In these situations you become a bit paranoid, you doubt everything. We don't feel that the authorities are taking this very seriously. I don't mean that they want to hush up the matter, but almost.\" The former West Ham and Spurs striker Freddie Kanoute, who plays for Sevilla in Spain, said the attacks had changed the mood within the Malian squad who are due to play the hosts Angola on Sunday evening. \"All you think about is your family and your life. It's normal that they want to pull out.\" Angola has bet a great deal on the Cup of Nations, the continent's most keenly followed sporting event, to open a new chapter in its history after a 27-year civil war that cost up to one million lives and displaced four million people. The country has lavished $1bn (\u00a3625m) on stadiums, hotels and other infrastructure to host the tournament. Angola's sports minister, Gon\u00e7alves Muandumba, insisted: \"The championship will go on.\" A crisis meeting was expected to take place in the Angolan capital Luanda between local officials and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) over tournament security measures. The Togo team, travelling by coach from their training ground in Congo-Brazzaville, had just entered the Angolan enclave of Cabinda when they came under heavy machine-gun fire. Another bus, carrying equipment, was also sprayed with bullets. Aston Villa's Togolese midfielder Moustapha Salifou said he felt lucky to be alive. \"Our security people saved us,\" he told the club's website. \"They were in two cars, about 10 of them in total, and they returned fire. \"The shooting lasted for half an hour and I could hear the bullets whistling past me. It was like a movie. It was only 15 minutes after we crossed the border into Angola that we came under heavy fire. The driver was shot almost immediately and died instantly, so we were just stopped on the road with nowhere to go. \"I know I am really lucky. I was in the back of the coach with Emmanuel Adebayor and one of the goalkeepers. A defender sat in front of me took two shots in the back. The goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale, one of my best friends, was shot in the stomach and was flown to South Africa to undergo an operation to save his life. It was horrific. Everybody was crying. I don't know how anyone can do this. \"I am back at our camp in Cabinda with my team-mates but we all want to go home to Togo. We have made our decision. We can't play in these circumstances and want to leave for home.\" Others agreed the death toll would have been far higher but for the intervention of the squad's military escort. Hubert Velud said: \"What's sure is that the army saved our lives. Without them, the rebels would have destroyed us.\" Cabinda, the target of attacks by separatist rebels even after Angola's civil war ended in 2002, is responsible for half of Angola's oil production. However, Flec was not thought to be a serious risk. Last month, Angolan minister without portfolio Ant\u00f3nio Bento Bembe, a former Flec fighter, said the group no longer existed. He claimed all that remained of Flec was a few individuals who were trying to attract unhappy Cabindans with false statements. But Manuel Rabelais, Angola's information minister, said his government was now blaming the separatist group. He said the gunmen came from Congo-Brazzaville into Angola, and fled back after the attack. South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, will attend tomorrow's opening ceremony of the Nations Cup as planned, his spokesman said. But the tragedy has raised concerns about South Africa's ability to host 32 teams, including England, for the World Cup in June. Former Togo coach Otto Pfister said: \"This is a real blow for Africa. It will obviously be linked directly with the World Cup now. And it will give the critics a boost.\" South Africa has spent at least 13 billion rand (\u00a31.1bn) on new stadiums and infrastructure, and Zuma has described 2010 as the most important year for the country since the end of apartheid. Danny Jordaan, the chief World Cup organiser, said: \"It has no impact on our World Cup. The world understands that sovereign countries are responsible for their own safety and security and to say what happened in Angola impacts on the World Cup in South Africa is the same as suggesting that when a bomb goes off in Spain, it threatens London's ability to host the next Olympics.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
