Only 47 more days until we can all put this behind us. A parting tip for Showtime ahead of the remaining tour stops: why turn off McGregor\u2019s microphone during Mayweather\u2019s sermon? I\u2019d understand if the trash talk was the side course per usual, but don\u2019t hold out on us when events like today\u2019s are effectively the main course. At any rate, thanks for following along with us and do check back later for Rory Carroll\u2019s full report from the ground in Los Angeles. \u201cGod only made one thing perfect, and that\u2019s my boxing record,\u201d says Mayweather. And then they come together for the traditional staredown. They continue to mouth off at one another and Dana White is ultimately forced to break them up. More from Mayweather, who\u2019s just getting started. \u201cWe knew I was the A-side,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it says Mayweather first. That\u2019s why this bitch had to come to the boxing ring. Floyd then took aim at McGregor\u2019s three submission losses, only one in the UFC. \u201cWe know Mr Tapout like to quit and you will,\u201d Mayweather says, eyes narrowing. \u201cYou going out on your face or you going out on your back. Which way you want to go? Which way do you wanna go? McGregor says nothing. A mistake. \u201cThat\u2019s right, be quiet you little bitch.\u201d This is profane. And the crowd is loving it. Mayweather takes the stage after a short intro from Leonard Ellerbee and, wow ... just wow. He leads the crowd in a back-and-forth chant of his \u201cHard word, dedication\u201d mantra \u2013 and then we\u2019re off to the races: \u201cYou line \u2018em up and I knock \u2018em down. On August 26, I\u2019m gonna knock this bitch out too.\u201d McGregor fires back from the side: \u201cYou haven\u2019t knocked anyone out in about 20 years.\u201d Floyd is stalking back and forth across the stage like a revivalist preacher: \u201cDance for me, boy!\u201d cries McGregor, allowing scorekeepers at home to check racially charged rhetoric on their bingo cards. Dance for me, son!\u201d \u201cGive me that backpack!\u201d Floyd shouts to an assistant, before pulling out a $100m check from his last fight. Adds Mayweather: \u201cHe look good for for a seven-figure fighter, he look good for an eight-figure fighter. But mother-fucker, I\u2019m a nine figure fighter. This bitch made three million dollars his last fight. But we know that\u2019s training camp money for me.\u201d McGregor makes a crack from his chair about how Mayweather should give the money to the tax man, to which Mayweather quickly fires back: \u201cYou right, I\u2019m the IRS. I\u2019m gonna tax your ass.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in a fucking track suit,\u201d McGregor says to the delight of the crowd, before taking shots at Mayweather\u2019s reported tax troubles. \u201cHe can\u2019t even afford a suit anymore! The Rolls is a 2012 outside. He is fooked!\u201d Adds McGregor: \u201cThere\u2019s no other way about it. His little legs, his little core, his little head. I\u2019m going to knock him out inside of four rounds, mark my words. \u201cThe movement, the power, the ferociousness. He\u2019s not experienced this. He\u2019s fought people who have shied away fro, him. I don\u2019t fear this limited set of fighting. This is a limited set of rules that makes this half a fight, a quarter of a fight. If this was a true fight, it wouldn\u2019t even take one round. ... What can I say, I\u2019m a young confident happy man that has worked extremely hard for this.\u201d And here\u2019s UFC president Dana White. I haven\u2019t seen him this fired up since he stumped for Trump at the Republican National Convention. And now he introduces Conor McGregor ... Espinoza calls Mayweather \u201cby far, the No1 attraction in sports and entertainment\u201d. He says he\u2019s not at all surprised this fight is happening. It\u2019s been the plan all along. Now MGM Resorts president of sports and entertainment Richard Sturm is called to the mic and the crowd is getting restless. It\u2019s almost as if 20,000 fans are simultaneously realizing the occasional mind-numbing boredom of being a boxing journo. Conor pumping his fist in the background and whipping the crowd into a frenzy as Sturm drones on. Meanwhile, Mayweather is sitting arms crossed in a star-spangled The Money Team jumper with a hat that for some reason is emblazoned with the number 48. (He\u2019s 49-0, going for 50-0 with August\u2019s fight.) Showtime boxing czar Stephen Espinoza is at the dais. Basically, he\u2019s just pushing the cable network\u2019s programming over the next few weeks. We\u2019ve heard today\u2019s format is going to a bit of a hybrid of the traditional back-slapping boxing press conference in which a half-dozen suits take the mic before we hear from the principals and the far more fan-friendly UFC pressers that cut the fat and just go straight to the fighters. Now Floyd Mayweather emerges to a version of Meek Mill\u2019s Ima Boss that\u2019s just playing the one bar that name-checks Mayweather (\u201cAt the fight we watchin\u2019 Floyd we on the floor\u201d). Oh there he is. No question who the A-side is here as Mayweather makes his way to the stage from the back of the room surrounded by his linebacker-sized bodyguards and entourage. McGregor is on the stage in a pinstripe suit with a pink tie. By himself. Perhaps a sound issue in the building or on the audio feed but he\u2019s walked out by himself to no music or apparent fanfare. Maybe he just missed his cue? But he looks great. The live show is beginning now. To start it off, they\u2019re showing this official trailer on the JumboTron that was unveiled online on Friday. \u201cI could see him knocking out Floyd when it comes to the war of words,\u201d Ranallo says. Schaub piggy-backs: \u201cHe\u2019s undefeated in these press conferences.\u201d Oh dear. At least the building is full. Just remembering that I watched Aloe Blacc perform at the Ryder Cup last October. Could Jordin Sparks finally have competition on the sports circuit that she\u2019s owned for the better part of the last decade? Now Showtime breaks to promote some of their original programming. Now more analysis from Ranallo, Malignaggi and Schaub. Ranallo praises McGregor\u2019s \u201cgreat mind\u201d and \u201cwill to win\u201d. How ever can Mayweather overcome it? Schaub is happy to take this one. Boxers are slow starters, he says, and Mayweather is no exception. MMA fighters don\u2019t have that luxury since they\u2019re only in three-round fights, five at the championship level. Perhaps McGregor could steal few rounds early? Malignaggi counters by asking what if Mayweather sits back and rallies later in the fight? Schaub points to Mayweather\u2019s age \u2013 as if that\u2019s not the biggest red herring in this event altogether. Yes, Mayweather is 40. But there\u2019s not a ton of mileage on those tires. He doesn\u2019t drink, doesn\u2019t smoke and is one of the few fighters in the sport who stays in fighting shape 365 days a year. I\u2019d be more worried about McGregor in the deep waters of a 12-round fight than the guy who\u2019s been there dozens of times at the highest level. But what do I know? Ranallo just referred to the \u201cTwitter troglodytes\u201d who are slagging off this fight, saying those same people will be the last-minute impulse buyers. He\u2019s right but it sounds like a dare. Deep breaths. About 15 minutes before the \u201clive show\u201d begins. That might explain the press release that landed in my inbox last night. Yes, Aloe Blacc will be performing his new single King is Born live. To quote: As a special presentation at the tour\u2019s first event on Tuesday in Los Angeles, GRAMMY-nominated, multi-platinum XIX / Interscope recording artist Aloe Blacc will perform his new single \u201cKing Is Born\u201d live at STAPLES Center. Blacc is known for his hit singles \u201cI Need a Dollar,\u201d \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d \u201cThe Man\u201d and \u201cLove Is The Answer,\u201d all of which reflect his quest for social justice. Blacc is currently working on the follow up to his GRAMMY-nominated album \u201cLift Your Spirit.\u201d He is the man. Meanwhile, Schaub continues to harp on the point that McGregor is the bigger guy, casting the contracted weight of 154lbs as a concession by Mayweather and a miscalculation (perhaps forgetting that Mayweather defeated De La Hoya and Canelo Cotto at 154, Canelo at a catch-weight of 152). \u201cThis is more than a fight, this is a cultural event,\u201d barks Showtime\u2019s gratingly exitable Mauro Ranallo during his intro. And away we go. OT Genasis is performing in the background and it sounds from the echo as if the arena is mostly empty. Still about a half-hour from the main show. Now former UFC fighter Brendan Schaub, who once finished second in Spike TV\u2019s The Ultimate Fighter: Heavyweights, says that McGregor will pull off the biggest upset in sports history because Mayweather is going up against an unknown and he doesn\u2019t know how McGregor will come to fight. Oh boy. Well, here we are. Today marks the first official signpost on the road to the much-talked-about boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor: the kickoff of a four-city, three-country international press tour to drum up interest in their 12-round super welterweight matchup on 26 August at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. As I wrote in the Guardian when it was announced last month, this fight rates with other one-off sideshows in the annals of sport alongside Muhammad Ali\u2019s lamentable fight with the Japanese pro wrestler Antonio Inoki, the made-for-television 150m match race between Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson, and the Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. It\u2019s not a good thing or bad thing for either boxing or mixed martial arts as other prisoners of the moment will try to persuade you in countless thinkpieces over the next 47 days. It\u2019s not anything except a quick-strike cash grab with no long-term significance: a platform to prove that a seasoned professional boxer will defeat a first-time boxer in a boxing match. The price point for the pay-per-view telecast was announced yesterday: $89.95 for the standard-definition telecast, $99.95 for HD. You\u2019d be better off setting that money on fire. But to paraphrase the great Jimmy Connors: This is what they\u2019ll pay for. This is what they want. So who am I to pee in your Corn Flakes? Do I really hate fun? Of course not. This will get people under the tent and it\u2019s good for business. There will be lights and cameras and two hard men barking mean things to each other for the better part of seven weeks and then the bell will ring and Mayweather will coast to a 12-round unanimous decision. Really the only drama, as your humble narrator sees it, will be whether McGregor can land a single punch. (I sincerely doubt it). In many ways the most entertaining bits could come today, when the fighters meet face to the face for the first time, at least publicly. The tour kicks off in a few moments at the Staples Center in Los Angeles before heading to Toronto on Wednesday, Brooklyn on Thursday and London on Friday. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s a look at how Mayweather reportedly plans on spending at least part of his massive financial windfall from this fight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
