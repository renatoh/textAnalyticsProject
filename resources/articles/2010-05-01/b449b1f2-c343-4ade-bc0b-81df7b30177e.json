The deputy prime minister has certainly decided to lead from the front. He talked a very big game in his speech on new politics yesterday. Big sweeping change. A big bang approach to reform. The biggest shakeup of British democracy since 1832. These are not exactly modest claims. Rhetoric of this kind will generate great and genuine expectation in many who have argued for similarly bold reform moves in recent years and are impatient for action. So, the big question, how does Mr Clegg's prospectus actually measure up? And how, in the end, will it all go down? The first thing to say is that Mr Clegg's speech was strategically coherent as well as hugely refreshing. He has a holistically liberal approach to the subject, summed up in the aspiration \"to transform our politics so that the state has far less control over you and you have far more control over the state\". The contrast between this approach to reform and the tactical and piecemeal approach of Gordon Brown in his many speeches on the subject is very striking. It is generally very much in Mr Clegg's favour too, even if the former prime minister occasionally, though not often, offered more radical change on individual reform items than Mr Clegg, coalition constrained, can do. In the end, though, Mr Brown typically delivered less than he promised. Mr Clegg will be expected to deliver on the grand scale both because he has set the bar high and because success or failure here will do much to shape the verdict on the Liberal Democrat record in the coalition. In yesterday's speech, the Lib Dem leader set himself three broad fields of reform: first, to roll back intrusive and unnecessary intrusions on freedom; second, to reform the British political system in a more open and representative manner; and third, to redistribute power away from the centre towards a more local and neighbourhood focus. It is certainly an ambitious approach and it undoubtedly deserves to succeed. The test of it will be in the detail, much of which has not yet been set out (or possibly even thought through). The section on rolling back state intrusion deserves the most unconstrained cheer and may also prove the easiest to effect. Not doing intrusive things \u2013 like ID cards, identity registers, biometric passports and children's records \u2013 is relatively quick and straightforward. Putting limits on CCTV is harder, and it was worrying that Mr Clegg said nothing about police powers and photography. Scrapping laws will also take more time and could be more complicated, as will much of the devolution of power. Everyone may agree that there are far too many criminal justice laws, too many offences and too much centralisation, but codifying those laws and handing power down, while necessary, is not straightforward, as the issue of libel law reform also illustrates. But at least there is broad coalition agreement on how to deal with most of this. Agreement is more fragile, however, on much of the political reform package and on the status of the Human Rights Act, where many in the two parties are irreconcilable. A proportionately elected House of Lords would be a huge reform, for example, but without a clear timetable and peers' approval it may remain frustratingly elusive. Voting reform for the Commons, meanwhile, is even more uncertain, since the proposed new system is not fully supported by either the Conservatives or the Lib Dems \u2013 and then requires a referendum yes vote too. The coalition has a huge opportunity to do good in all this. Mr Clegg has set out a big vision. Reformers should wish it well, though detail is still needed and battles await. The prize is huge. But the politics are not easy. This is a bold first step. But a very long march now beckons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
