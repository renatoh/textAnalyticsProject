In its consultative document published last week, the Government asks whether the Child Trust Fund should offer the option of different invest ment strategies, or just one. It also asks what role there is for financial services providers in delivering deposit capability, investment management, advice and information. 'Invest the money in equities,' shout the fund managers. They argue that over the past 18 years, stock market returns have outstripped cash deposits by about 1,300 per cent. 'No, invest the money in cash - it's safer,' say the banks and building societies. They point out that people who have little in the way of assets cannot afford to risk losing their money in a stock market crash. Others suggest a sensible compromise: equity investment for the first 16 years or so, then safer fixed-interest bonds and deposits. If the Government does decide to offer a variety of investment options, the issue of charges and advice will become very important. Any charges will have to be kept extremely low to ensure children receive maximum benefit from the relatively small amounts of money invested on their behalf. This raises the question of whether financial services providers will be prepared to provide the advice that parents will need when choosing an investment strategy. Investors are already struggling to decide whether they will benefit from the new stakeholder pension. Its low charges (a maximum 1 per cent) mean there is not enough money for pension providers to pay worthwhile commission to independent financial advisers. At the same time providers do not consider it cost-effective to give advice themselves. Most provide information in booklet or website form - all very well, but these can not answer questions. As our feature on page 14 points out, the aim of the Child Trust Fund is to help those from poor backgrounds, with no experience of investing assets, to escape the dependency culture. This money could change their lives for the better, so this time the Government should ensure they get the advice they need."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
