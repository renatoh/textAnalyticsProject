The yard which built the Titanic has joined forces with environmental waste management company Golder Associates and is bidding to become the first in the UK licensed for the environmentally-friendly dismantling of aged ships and oil rigs. Vessel recycling in Europe is a rapidly growing industry with tough new regulations meaning owners can no longer have old vessels driven on to beaches in the Far East where they are stripped for scrap without any safety or environmental checks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
