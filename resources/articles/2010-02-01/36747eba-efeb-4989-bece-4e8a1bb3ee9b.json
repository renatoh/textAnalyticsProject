Don't read on if you haven't seen episode five \u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that many UK viewers will not have done so\u2026 Anna Pickard's episode four blog \"The Rhodes not taken\" Rachel is still off starring in Sue and Sandy's Cabaret \u2013 which is a brilliant name for a club, brilliant. But after meeting a waiter who has been kept back in school for several extra years just so he can perform with Vocal Adrenaline, Mr Shue suddenly realises the future for New Directions lies in the past. Specifically, in seeking out the star of Glee club from when Mr Shue was at McKinley. April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth) may now be a washed-up drunk, but she can still belt it like an iron-clad diva. And so she re-enrols in high school (that's possible!?) and becomes Mr Shue's new star performer, with the rest of the club demoted to backing vocal duty (and they're not happy about it). You know, I'm starting to doubt Mr Shue's credentials as an inspirational icon on the level of, say, Dead Poets Society. But never mind that for now. April does win over the Glee club, although possibly not in the way the Mr Shue intended. She hands out booze to Kurt, showers with the football players, and teaches Mercedes and Tina the very best way to shoplift. Then, after one last vocal as lead Gleester, April realises she's had her time, and should give the same chance to the young'uns. Programme notes Kristin Chenoweth, last seen squeaking in a magic pie shop in Pushing Daisies, is, like most of the cast of this show, an established Broadway actor and singer. And boy, do we know it. Some of you will be more familiar than I with how one should accurately rank a star of musicals, and will undoubtedly be able to properly judge whether April (/Kristin) or Rachel (/Lea) won the battle of Cabaret. But to an ear unschooled in musical theatre, I would guess April. Am I right? Oh! And: I meant to mention this before: Sandy Ryerson, played by Stephen Tobolowsky? Clearly a close relation of Ned: You remember Ned. Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned\u2026 (from Groundhog Day \u2013 and played by Stephen Tobolowsky). This is the first episode to be so closely wrapped around the story of a guest star and so, as such, does little in terms of moving the Glee club toward Sectionals and various people toward motherhood, fatherhood, or realising the truth. But that, apparently, is one of the things series creator Ryan Murphy is happy to do \u2013 standalone episodes that function just fine as an hour of fun, froth, wit, regardless of the storylines that might have seemed so very pressing last week. Gleefilled quotes The only thing Kurt had to say on being discovered to have breath like rubbing alcohol by the implausibly big-eyed Emma Pillsbury was: \"Oh Bambi! I cried so hard when those hunters shot your mommy\" \u2013 before throwing up on her shoes. And Will's only attempt to be inspirational: \"See, April? See what you can achieve sober?\" \"Sober!?! I'm rolling on a handful of horse tranquillizers! I can't feel ma'lips!\" SueSylvesterism of the week: When taking control of Cabaret away from Sandy and giving it to Rachel: \"When I heard that Sandy wanted to write himself into one scene as Queen Cleopatra I was aroused \u2026 then furious.\" Euw. Set list Don't Stop Believin'- Journey; Maybe This Time, and Cabaret - from Cabaret; Alone - Heart; Last Name - Carrie Underwood; Somebody to Love - Queen Performance of the week Surely, Somebody to Love. Whether because it's a refreshingly choral performance in a solo-heavy episode, or because of the song itself, something makes me tingle each time I watch it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
