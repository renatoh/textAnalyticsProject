Joshua said he spent his 30th birthday in digs in Sheffield, has cut out salt and invested significantly on top\u2011quality sparring partners in a bid to win back his title. The former WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion said he has the same \u201clockdown\u201d attitude he had as a youngster after nearly going to jail \u2013 when he prayed for a second chance at life \u2013 into his preparations. \u201cWhen I went into boxing, I was getting into a lot of trouble,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI had a major court case and I prayed: \u2018God, if you give me a second chance at life I will make all the changes in the world.\u2019 When I beat that court case, I got into boxing and I focused. \u201cSame thing with Ruiz, give me a second chance at life and see what I can do. I just dedicated myself. I said I would put myself on a 15-year prison sentence to boxing and have that focus.\u201d That was in 2008 but when it was put to Joshua that he might retire in 2023 he replied: \u201cI could go on longer. It\u2019s just a mindset, a prison mindset, like a military mindset, lockdown. Training, focus, sleep. You have to have that mindset. You have to be in that regimen.\u201d That includes celebrating his birthday at his digs in Sheffield where he talked to his nutritionist Mark Ellison about training. \u201cI live boxing, I live it, that\u2019s all I do,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI have a lot more energy now I am no longer focused on any other opponent than Ruiz.\u201d Joshua has also corrected the failings of his first camp against Ruiz, when he lacked sparring partners who could replicate the Mexican-American\u2019s style and paid the price when he was stopped in the seventh round. \u201cSparring is important because it is the closest thing you can get to the fight,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always want to do it because it is a big cost but it\u2019s the best way to prepare. They throw everything at me, if I do 12 rounds then it\u2019s with five different people back-to-back and I am dealing with every shot coming at me. \u201cRuiz doesn\u2019t get enough credit for his jab. We need to be prepared for that, which is why we got so many sparring partners in.\u201d Joshua has also been speaking regularly to Wladimir Klitschko, who has given him \u201ctonnes of advice\u201d on cutting out salt, improving his hydration and how to prepare his body better. \u201cIt\u2019s almost good that I lost because all of the sparring partners are coming out of the woodwork now, no one wanted to spar me before,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cKlitschko told me it would happen, he said he could only get good sparring after he had lost. It\u2019s ended up like a blessing because everyone wants to come to the gym now. When we lace the gloves up now there is no holding back.\u201d Joshua also denied claims from his rivals, including Tyson Fury, that he had fallen out of love with boxing. \u201cI still enjoy it 100%, because I am getting better all the time,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cYou have someone like Vasyl Lomachenko, who is great but then you have some who get better with every fight, like Canelo \u00c1lvarez, and that is what I am. You are going to see me get better every step of the way. One loss can\u2019t strip your skin off overnight, when you put your solid foundations in, one chip in the brick can\u2019t destroy the whole building.\u201d Joshua said he has watched the first fight repeatedly in slow-motion, looking for how he could correct his mistakes. \u201cUntil he caught me, I was beating him to the punch,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all quick, but first two or three rounds I was beating him to the punch. He got hurt, I just have to keep down this time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
