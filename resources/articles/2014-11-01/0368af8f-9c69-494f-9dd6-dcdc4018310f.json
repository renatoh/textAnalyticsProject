Inappropriately heavy corporate branding alternates with frenetic musical garnish, excruciatingly \u201cartistic\u201d re-enactions with sonorous drivel apparently downloaded randomly from a cliche generator. With so much amazing stuff to aim a camera at, this is not a complete waste of time; but only if you can tune out pretty much every bit of \u201cadded value\u201d the film-makers shove on. Event cinema ought to be better than this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
