That was where I had my first holiday romance. I can't remember her name. We sat next to each other on a rock overlooking the sea. She had long hair down to her waist. I didn't chase her - we just ended up going out in one of those quick deals that are done when you're a kid: 'Right, we're going out', 'Oh, OK then!' I'd have been six or seven. At Butlins in Skegness we became latchkey kids for the week. I was eight and I'd get my key in the morning and head off for the day. My cousins used to go every year and raise hell. My auntie would pay for a family of four and end up with 14 people in a chalet, three to a bed. We'd smuggle people in. One time they drove in with my cousin in the boot of the car. It was the sort of holiday where you were just left alone to do what you wanted. We went off following girls around and getting into scrapes. Once we spent the whole week battling with these Scouse lads and then, on the last day before everybody went home, we all became best friends. The entertainment was really bizarre. My brother entered the talent contest and went blank on stage. We were waiting for a puddle to form around his feet but he ended up just humming the whole of 'Long Haired Lover from Liverpool'. My sister did well though - she won a holiday for her and Mum with her ballet. Dad thought you should make your outfit for the fancy dress contest from what you found on campus, but there'd be well-to-do families who would turn up with some sort of Merchant Ivory outfit. Dad would sit there going, 'It's not on, it's not right', and I'd be there dressed as peas in a pod, wearing a green leotard tied to eight balloons, next to a finely detailed Queen Elizabeth I. That holiday was the first time I saw Mum get tipsy - she was doing the Paxo-sponsored chicken dance. I've still got a lovely black and white picture of my Mum at Butlins, drunk. My cousins were the scourge of Butlins. One year they broke into the ballroom and took the top off the bingo machine. By the time security arrived all the balls were shooting into the air. We got into some scrapes too. We got into a fight on the pitch-and-putt green with these two lads. One was massive and the other was tiny. My brother said I could take the big one. I got pasted! You could torture the Redcoats. You know they're paid to be cheerful and nice to everyone, even obnoxious kids, but you could see their forced smiles. They must have drunk heavily between shifts. Around the corner from the main ballroom was a seedy black room that was a teenagers' disco. You were rough and ready if you went in there - you were either looking for trouble or lurve! There was also a room I thought was just magical because it had 30 snooker tables in it. It was a big thing that you could play snooker like an adult at Butlins. There must have been so much ripped cloth and a big part of the budget must have gone on snooker table repairs. After that, my Dad was laid off and the next holiday I went on was with the Catholic Men's Society Club for deprived kids when I was 12. It was a big stigma because I never felt deprived. They took us to this youth hostel in Wales, and funnily enough we visited Butlins at Pwllheli for a day. We got done for begging! We were begging for money to play on the Galaxians video game - the one thing at Butlins that wasn't free. I don't remember going on a holiday again untiI I took myself off to San Antonio, Ibiza, at 18 or 19. We were there for three nights and spent ages looking for this utopia of women and massive clubs and parties, but instead we wound up in a disco full of Spanish people, looking like they were going to beat us up for dancing to 'Saturday Night Fever'. I'm not a brave traveller on my own and I think it's because we never went on foreign holidays when I was a kid. I love San Francisco and I'm becoming more confident in LA and New York, but I'm very domestic with my holidays. I'll go to Scotland or Wales - somewhere I can be beside the sea. If I can get away I love going to Robin Hood's Bay up on the east coast near Whitby. All I need is a cottage and wood to chop. I'm going back to Butlins this year with my brother and my nieces. I've been invited to do a show there but I don't want to associate it with work. I did a gig at Disneyland Paris but I think there is more reality at Butlins. Disneyland seemed so false. I've always had an aversion to Center Parcs, too. It seems too cultured. Yes, you can go and learn to play tennis or ride a bike but I can do all that from home. Butlins had a fairground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
