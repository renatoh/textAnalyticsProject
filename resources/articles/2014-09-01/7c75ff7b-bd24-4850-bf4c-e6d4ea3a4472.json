Brendan Rodgers\u2019 shoulders slumped in his club suit as a potential turning point flipped from Liverpool to Everton with one sensational swing of a central defender\u2019s boot. The football gods shined on Everton, according to their manager\u2019s description of Phil Jagielka\u2019s 92nd-minute equaliser, but the truth is both Merseyside clubs remain in need of divine intervention to fulfil pre-season aspirations on current form. Liverpool are considering taking disciplinary action against Mamadou Sakho after their \u00a319m defender stormed out of Anfield at 11.20am when told he did not feature in the matchday squad. A TV with the 223rd Merseyside derby on repeat should suffice. The France international, who apologised to anyone offended by \u201ca bad choice on my part\u201d, missed a day of redemption for two club captains dogged by criticism since the World Cup and confirmation that the teams led by Jagielka and Steven Gerrard are pale imitations of last season\u2019s finely balanced, threatening forces. A combined total of 13 points from 12 Premier League outings by the Merseyside rivals this season seemed an accurate gauge on Saturday. Thanks to the football gods then for the contributions of Gerrard and Jagielka. Not only did they aid and abet standout performances from those alongside them, the aggressive Jordan Henderson and nerveless John Stones, but the pair gave timely evidence of their continued importance to drag the derby out of the mundane. Liverpool\u2019s captain took it to within touching distance of an invaluable three points for Rodgers\u2019 team with his 10th goal in 32 appearances against Everton, a powerfully struck free-kick beyond the badly positioned Tim Howard. Jagielka elevated the contest further, further perhaps than he thought possible, with one of the great derby goals. In body-shape, execution with the outside of the right foot, trajectory, timing and significance, the England international\u2019s 58mph drive into the top corner of Simon Mignolet\u2019s goal in front of the Kop was straight from the pages of Roy of the Rovers. The only thing missing was a cartoon trail behind the ball. \u201cIt is such an incredible moment in our season because we got something and it brings the confidence back into the group which is vitally important,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. \u201cAfter their goal goes in, and having come here for 15 years without a win, the players had a choice to make. Do we accept it or do we use the little energy that we had left to go forward? I feel that over the course of the season the football gods give you something back if you carry on working and I think the players were magnificent in their psychological strength. I saw a winning mentality in our team. \u201cWe were very poor on the ball. We were not expansive in the way we normally are but I don\u2019t think Liverpool were either. They never hurt us, everything was dead balls and corners. We could have done better on the counterattack but overall I didn\u2019t think it was as good a game as we saw in both derbies last season.\u201d Rodgers, not surprisingly on an afternoon when Liverpool\u2019s suspect defence was rarely tested by their local rivals and who flatly denied his team had invited late pressure with a collective retreat, saw things differently. \u201cIt was just that final ball, we couldn\u2019t quite get that second goal,\u201d said the Liverpool manager. \u201cIf you take away the last 90 seconds of the game we are talking about an excellent performance of intensity, pressure and passing with counter-attacking football. I\u2019m not going to let one absolute once-in-a-lifetime strike cloud that \u2013 but we will be judged on that because it is one all.\u201d Both managers were searching for positives more in hope than on the evidence of Saturday\u2019s game. True, the tireless Adam Lallana, the tiring Raheem Sterling and an industrious Mario Balotelli failed to take presentable chances for Liverpool. Everton should have been down to 10 men after only eight minutes when Gareth Barry, booked inside the opening minute, somehow escaped a penalty and a second yellow card for handling Sterling\u2019s shot inside the area. The referee, Martin Atkinson, also failed to award a legitimate penalty to the visitors when Alberto Moreno pulled the badly out-of-sorts Romelu Lukaku to the floor in the fifth minute. For all of Liverpool\u2019s possession, however, the inspiration, menace and penetration of last season remained elusive. Daniel Sturridge\u2019s return from a thigh injury cannot come quickly enough but the forward, Rodgers confirmed afterwards, is a doubt for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League tie at Basel. Mart\u00ednez summed up the difference between the Liverpool team that inflicted a 4-0 defeat on Everton in January and the present in cutting fashion. \u201cIt is easy to say \u2013 Luis Su\u00e1rez was a player on form,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you have a very strong squad and it takes time and it needs to gel together. The difference back then was that everyone knew Liverpool were very dynamic and any time you left yourself two v one against Su\u00e1rez you were in trouble. That is not there any more and that is a big difference.\u201d Man of the match John Stones (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
