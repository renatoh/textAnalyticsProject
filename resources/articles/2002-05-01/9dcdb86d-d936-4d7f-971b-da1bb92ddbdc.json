The chances of that, however, are almost non-existent. \"Roy's very emotional,\" said the FAI's treasurer John Delaney last night. \"But we are all hurt. The important thing is that there doesn't seem to be any change in his attitude. I don't think things have changed at all.\" In Japan McCarthy could hardly have been more vehement in his insistence that he would never work with Keane again and said before the interview was broadcast yesterday that at least four players had threatened to quit if he were reinstated. The 35-minute interview was broadcast at 2am in Japan (6pm BST) and McCarthy had stayed up at the team's hotel here in Izumo to hear Keane's comments. In Seoul, where he is attending Fifa's extraordinary congress, the FAI's general secretary Brendan Menton was also listening in. However Keane's refusal to issue an apology effectively ended any chance of him returning to the Far East. Indeed there were times when he appeared wholly unrepentant about having instigated the row with McCarthy last Thursday that led to his expulsion from their training camp in Saipan. \"Of course it's hurting me, damn right it is. I want to play in the World Cup and maybe there's a way, who knows? But my conscience is clear, that's all that matters,\" he said. \"I've made mistakes but I'm sticking to my guns. I'm standing firm for what I believe in.\" It transpired that Keane, on the advice of the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, had asked his solicitor Michael Kennedy to instigate talks yesterday with the FAI's hierarchy and McCarthy's agent Liam Gaskin. \"Would they take me back? I don't know. I would meet them halfway. I would love to be back, definitely,\" Keane said. \"It all got messy but maybe there is a way to sort it out.\" The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, confirmed that there had been an \"enormous amount of pressure\" for him to intervene in the row but said that he could not cross the line between politics and sport. \"There is no doubt there is a passionate feeling by the people in this country,\" he said, adding that everyone would be \"happier, and probably sleeping happier\" if Keane were to rejoin his team-mates. The FAI's development officer John Byrne said: \"Strenuous efforts have been made but I can't see a resolution. Had Roy gone a bit further then maybe. But it's up to him to pick up the phone and apologise to Mick.\" Journalists were refused entry to the team's hotel last night but McCarthy will say today that Keane forfeited his right to play when he abused the manager during Thursday's confrontation in Saipan. Keane's lack of contrition has effectively sealed his fate. \"What happened was wrong,\" he said. \"I was forced into a corner and there was only going to be one winner. That was always going to be Mick.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
