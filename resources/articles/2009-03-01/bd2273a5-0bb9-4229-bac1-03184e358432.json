Murray is still yet to lose a set in this year's tournament after overcoming the 74th-ranked Ljubicic in just over two hours and will now meet the winner of the Roger Federer-Fernando Verdasco quarter-final. The British number one was made to toil by Ljubicic, but made good on his promise to be more aggressive from the start, immediately breaking the 30-year-old in the opening game and looking sharp as he raced into a 2-0 lead. Ljubicic fought back, however, breaking back to level at 3-3, but was unable to continue his momentum, making errors to allow Murray a break at 5-5, which proved decisive for the first set. The second set went with serve before coming to life in the ninth game. Ljubicic, serving at deuce, was unhappy when Murray called a shot in and saw the Hawk-Eye replay support his claim. The Croat was sure the line judge had correctly called the shot out and became even angrier when the umpire admitted he agreed with him, but could not overrule the technology. The deflated Ljubicic subsequently conceded the game on the next point, but Murray was unable to serve out the match at 5-4, and the match went to a tie-break, in which Murray finally prevailed 8-6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
