But the names of a few of those who have called it a day in 2003 will be laden with renown for quite a while yet, writes Frank Keating . The British hurdler Colin Jackson and the triple jumper Jonathan Edwards will be remembered as paragons of (unquestionably drug-free) high achievement, sportsmanship and modesty. Likewise, without a single flamboyant boast, the crafted control of the jockey Pat Eddery lifted horsemanship to the most prominent levels of art as well as science. Of the cricketers unbuckling their pads for the last time, Alec Stewart does so as the finest wicketkeeper-batsman in England's Test history, and the South African Jonty Rhodes as, simply, the most thrilling fielder the game has seen. As another old year turns, other legends still dither over their farewell speech. Steve Waugh, Australia's most successful cricket captain (if not the best: Richie Benaud, Ian Chappell and Mark Taylor contest that palm) has organised his leaving do for the second week of the new year, but if India continue their Christmas revelry in Melbourne some ruthless selectors could yet poop weather-beaten ol' Baggy Green's party plans. Lennox Lewis continues to ponder whether a last golden handshake is worth a painful sock on the jaw from a raging young Ukrainian. At the same time I detect a growing swell, even among his friends, for England's heart-of-oak rugby captain Martin Johnson to retire on his substantial laurels. For the tough at the top, the only route left is down. We shall see - my hunch is that if Johnson decides not to go out on this highest of hosannas, then Clive Woodward will have unceremoniously done the deed for him ere the end of the Six Nations tournament in March. By which time I fancy another former England captain, cricket's Nasser Hussain, will also have got the message before being handed his P45; certainly it would melt some hearts to see him as permanent, and seething, drinks waiter on the upcoming West Indies tour. Of the certain curtain calls of 2003, the two I'll miss most of all are Jackson the hurdler and Rhodes the cricketer. Although he was the favourite in probably three of the four Olympics in which he competed, there is no question that Jackson left his sport unfulfilled for not having won the gold medal. He was the acknowledged maestro of his event for well over a decade - and in the very few times he lost a race, well, has British sport ever produced a better and more chivalrous loser? I shall never forget the tears coursing down his face as he came off the track to the changing room below immediately after he had lost the Olympic final at Barcelona in 1992. \"Don't cry, Colin,\" I sympathised. \"Sorry,\" he wept, \"but actually I'm crying tears of sheer joy for the winner.\" The gold medal had gone to Canada's Mark McKoy, his best friend, who had spent the year living with Jackson at his Rhoose home near Cardiff. Cricket lore is littered with luminous fieldsmen - Australians \"Nip\" Pellew, Neil Harvey, Paul Sheahan; West Indians Learie Constantine, Clive Lloyd, Roger Harper; Englishmen Jack Hobbs and Derek Randall. The memorial to Rhodes's utter primacy is that history will hold him in even more lustre than his compatriot Colin Bland. Rhodes gloriously elevated a timeless activity and his very presence blue-funked batsmen with his concentrated fervour, his instinctive dare, his dash, his dives, his seemingly telescopic arms and his dry-cleaning bill. \"Like watching Fred Astaire dance on a daily basis,\" said the BBC radio commentator Henry Blofeld when he once concentrated solely on watching Rhodes in the field for a single over. Rhodes put it all down to God - as did Jonathan Edwards - and who is to argue with that? Britain did have two Olympic gold medallists in the triple jump - Peter O'Connor, Athens 1906; and Tim Ahearne, London 1908 - but both were Irishmen made to compete under the British flag because Ireland was not accepted as a separate Olympic nation until Paris in 1924. Although Keith Connor stoutly won a bronze medal in Los Angeles in 1984, the Brits really did not give tuppence for the triple jump before the slim, elastic Edwards burst on to the runway in the mid-1990s when, in a matter of weeks, he smithereened the 10-year-old world record and successively became the first man to break the 18-metre barrier and the \"impossible\" 60-foot mark. He achieved all this with a choirboy's smile, which served well in presenting Songs of Praise. But as the sage Michael Johnson said: \"For such a mild and gentle saint, Jonathan's determination was utterly frightening.\" After rugby's World Cup you would have to say France's pocket Napoleon and scrum-half Fabien Galthi\u00e9 retired unfulfilled, a sentiment that also cloaks the international departure of Scotland's Lion Gregor Townsend, who never once, to my mind, lived up to the glisteningly cocksure announcement of himself with that mesmeric midfield pop-pass scissors with Gavin Hastings in Paris all those years ago. Cricket's engaging and waywardly devilish-fast Devon Malcolm certainly won't feel unfulfilled as long as Wisden publishes nine for 57 v South Africa, The Oval 1994 as the eighth best bowling return in Test history. The legend logs Les Ames (ave 40 in 47 Tests, eight hundreds; 74 catches, 23 stumpings) and Alan Knott (ave 32 in 95, five hundreds, 250 c, 19st) as England's finest wicketkeeper-batsmen. Master of the bland post-match cliche, spick, span, spruce and laundered, Alec Stewart has a record as a Test wicketkeeper that matches them - ave 35 in 79, six hundreds, 215 c, 14 st - and his record when not behind the stumps boosts this: ave 46 in 51, a further nine hundreds and another 36 catches. Stewart's first Test was 14 winters ago, but his inordinate stretch at the top was nothing compared with Pat Eddery's, a noncommittal sportsman who saved all his eloquence for the meticulous judgment and nerveless driving of fast- finishing thoroughbreds. The most epic and awe-inspiring horse race I ever witnessed was almost 30 years ago at Ascot, in the 1975 King George, when Grundy heroically got level with and then thrillingly held off the champion Bustino by a nose. The world stood still that afternoon. \"Yeah, we did okay to get up in the last six strides,\" muttered Grundy's baby-faced jockey, shyly matter-of-fact before scurrying off to be weighed. Unforgettable days, when Eddery was in his fresh green prime. Just as, in a way, was I."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
