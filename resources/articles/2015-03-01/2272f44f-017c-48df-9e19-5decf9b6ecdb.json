Following the midweek loss to Paris Saint-Germain at Stamford Bridge minds are now focused on maintaining their five-point advantage at the top in the domestic title race by defeating Southampton on Sunday. Mourinho and his players conducted a half-hour meeting at Cobham on Thursday where recent defensive frailties, particularly at set pieces, and the fluency of their attacking play were discussed. Yet, with all those who featured against PSG having declared themselves fully fit and available, Mourinho will not make sweeping changes for the game, sure as he is that a team who have sat at the top all season boast the qualities to finish the job. \u201cI have the same belief in these players as I\u2019ve always had,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolutely unshakeable. It\u2019s one thing to be disappointed and try and find the reasons why we \u2013 not \u2018them\u2019 \u2013 didn\u2019t succeed in these games. It\u2019s another thing to lose belief in the players. \u201cBut these are the same players who have been top of the league since day one. And the same players who ended with zero defeats in their eight Champions League matches. These are the same people who won the League Cup. The same people who are going to win the Premier League. If we do that, a season with the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup is a brilliant season.\u201d Players and coaching staff spoke at the debriefing \u2013 \u201cGood opinions, different opinions, the players responding the way I expected,\u201d said Mourinho \u2013 with the manager\u2019s intention to draw a line under the European campaign. \u201cYou go out of the Champions League once a season,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are clubs that can be out of European competitions twice in a season, but not us. This was not just a match on Wednesday. It was a chapter. So we closed the chapter, but we still have the book to write. We have 11 more matches to finish the book. Let\u2019s see if the last page of the book is with the Premier League trophy in our hands.\u201d There was an acknowledgement that Chelsea are \u201cnot playing at the same level now\u201d as earlier this term, with Mourinho putting that down to an accumulation of niggling injuries and untimely suspensions to key personnel. Cesc F\u00e0bregas, who is without an assist since mid-January having initially revelled in his return to English football, has been labouring with fitness problems, with the team\u2019s rhythm disrupted by the bans incurred by Diego Costa, who is without a goal in two months, and Nemanja Matic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect the team who played Burnley in the first game in August to play the last game without being interrupted in between,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThis is a season. Injuries and suspensions are normal. Form going up and down is normal. It\u2019s normal that we lost a little bit of our fluidity, our confidence, so our numbers in terms of goals scored, chances created [go down]. We have the correct number of players, and I trust the guys. I\u2019m happy. \u201cWe have 11 matches to play, six at home and five away, difficult matches with London derbies and against teams who desperately need points to play in next year\u2019s Champions League or to stay in the Premier League. The two extremes. But we are also at one extreme as a team who wants to win the Premier League title. I think our answer is going to be good. I really believe we are going to win it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
