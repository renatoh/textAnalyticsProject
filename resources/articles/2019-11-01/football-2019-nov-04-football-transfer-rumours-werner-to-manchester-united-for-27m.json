And to make the winter transfer window more enjoyable for the club\u2019s fans than actually watching his team play, he will try to get one over on Liverpool while doing so. Timo Werner has been linked with a move to Anfield for so long we suspect he was being watched by club scouts when he was weening \u2013 and when a move to Bayern Munich fell through last year, Liverpool jumped to the top of the queue to sign the Leipzig goal-guzzler. The thing is, Solskj\u00e6r will try to sweet-talk the 23-year-old into a move to Old Trafford instead by telling Werner that he will play every week at United, whereas if he signed for Liverpool, he\u2019d become a Carabao Cup cameo man like Rhian Brewster. Werner would only cost United his \u00a327m buyout clause, too, which would make him that rarest of things at Old Trafford: a good value signing. What a time to be alive! There is the possibility that Werner will just choose Liverpool anyway, because who wouldn\u2019t want to be hugged regularly by J\u00fcrgen Klopp? If this happens, Solskj\u00e6r may nip in ahead of Milan to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a short-term deal till the end of the season. This would be ludicrous but at least it would free up money for a midfield reinforcement \u2013 and at the top of United\u2019s wishlist is West Ham\u2019s ball-winning tempo man Declan Rice. But get this, the Hammers want \u00a380m for him. Oof! Mauricio Pochettino has decided Hugo Lloris might not be very good any more \u2013 and what better time to replace him than when he\u2019s on the sidelines nursing a dislocated elbow. Ajax\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Onana impressed Tottenham\u2019s manager last season and would be the No 1 target but he\u2019ll cost \u00a335m \u2013 and this is Spurs we\u2019re talking about. We may have to put up with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s punditry for longer than we would like after Max Allegri jumped to the top of the shortlist to succeed Niko Kovac at Bayern Munich. And rumour has it that Unai Emery has been given a month to save his Arsenal job and the Gunners would not be in a hurry to hand Mourinho the keys to the Emirates Stadium in any case. Despite not having a manager, Bayern Munich still have the hots for Manchester City\u2019s convalescing winger Leroy San\u00e9. It was expected the German champions would have to bid up to \u00a385m to lure him away from the Etihad Stadium but Bayern believe an offer of \u00a369m will land them the 23-year-old, who will have only 18 months remaining on his contract this January. City could use a slice of the money they get from selling San\u00e9 to bring in Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. The powerful midfielder would cost around \u00a335m but Barcelona are also sniffing around Turin and may be the Uruguay international\u2019s preferred destination. Brendan Rodgers is keenly aware that the in-form Jamie Vardy\u2019s football party can\u2019t go on for ever. He\u2019s fast approaching 33 and could fall apart at any minute. So Leicester have sent scouts to Metz to look at Senegal striker Habibou Diallo. The 24-year-old has earned glowing reports, having scored seven goals in 11 games for the French club. Newcastle have also been monitoring the striker, which means the Foxes are surely favourites to sign him. Adam Lallana is expected to take his suitcase full of Cruyff turns to the Chinese Super League or MLS when his Liverpool contract ends next summer. And Jack Rodwell\u2019s agent is certainly earning his corn. After almost landing the much-mocked midfielder a move to Roma last week, the 28-year-old is now in talks with Serie A side Parma, whose sporting director Daniele Faggiano wants a player with a \u201cstrong engine\u201d. Get yourself revved up, Jack!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
