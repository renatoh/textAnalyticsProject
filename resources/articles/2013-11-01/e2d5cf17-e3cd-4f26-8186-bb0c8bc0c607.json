The chancellor, who recently visited China, tweeted on Monday night that he would deliver his autumn statement on Thursday 5 December to allow the prime minister time to return home from his visit to China. Osborne said the prime minister's trip was designed to \"strengthen economic ties\". The decision to delay the autumn statement, which has been on the cards for weeks, appears to be a matter of acute sensitivity in No 10. Aides are concerned that delaying the second most important financial statement of the year will show that the government is overly keen to please the Chinese. The prime minister's spokesman declined to confirm earlier on Monday rumours that the autumn statement would be held a day later. Downing Street has spent months laying the ground for Cameron's second visit to China as prime minister. No 10 had to abandon a trip earlier this year after Beijing made clear that the prime minister would be shunned by the Chinese leadership as a punishment for his decision to meet the Dalai Lama last year. Cameron announced in his speech to the lord mayor's banquet on Monday that he would be visiting China, three years after his first visit as prime minister in 2010. He said: \"This week I am leading trade visits to India and the Gulf. And I can announce this evening that in early December I will be leading another delegation to China. \"As China's new leadership sets its direction for the next 10 years, as their country's star continues to rise in the world, I will take senior British ministers \u2013 as well as business leaders from every sector large and small \u2013 to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples \u2013 opening the way for British companies to benefit from China's vast and varied markets and preparing the way for a new level of Chinese investment into the UK. \"This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
