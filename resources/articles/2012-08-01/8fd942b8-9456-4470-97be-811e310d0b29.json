Poulter mounted a strong challenge to eventual winner Rory McIlroy on Sunday, with the Englishman ultimately stumbling in the closing holes. Still, Poulter finished in a tie for third and now sits within the top 10 places of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal's team after replacing Sergio Garc\u00eda on the points list. \"This is the last tournament I was going to play for Ryder Cup qualification and I had to play well,\" Poulter said. \"I was just outside the points, now I'm just inside the points. I don't know how that's going to play out obviously with Gleneagles [next week's Johnnie Walker Championship is the last counting event], but hopefully that's good enough to get me an automatic spot.\" Garc\u00eda and Nicolas Colsaerts could knock Poulter out of the automatic reckoning once againat this week's Wyndham Championship in North Carolina. Yet Poulter is expected to be one of Olaz\u00e1bal's picks if that scenario occurs. \"I didn't want to rely on the phone call [for a wildcard],\" said Poulter. \"I've been there, albeit it was a nice phone call to receive from Nick Faldo because I was on the right side of it.\" Poulter ultimately signed for a 69 on Sunday. \"It's just a shame I couldn't quite finish it off,\" he added. \"I guess it was a dream start and it was a great day.\" As things stand McIlroy, Justin Rose, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Paul Lawrie, Peter Hanson and Francesco Molinari have all secured a place in Olaz\u00e1bal's team. There is hope, too, for David Lynn. The Stoke player is celebrating the best finish of his professional career, in only his second major appearance, after finishing second at Kiawah Island. Lynn will compete at Gleneagles, as will Colsaerts. \"I'm up to 15th on the rankings,\" Lynn said. \"I would have to qualify automatically and will be trying to win at Gleneagles. \"I had a chance once before in 2004. I was leading at halfway in Germany and someone told me if I won I had of chance of making it. I didn't win. \"I suppose if I did win at Gleneagles and was 11th or something on the rankings I would have a chance of a wildcard. I'm just glad to be part of the conversation, to be honest.\" The United States have now confirmed their eight automatic picks for Medinah as Tiger Woods, Bubba Watson, Jason Dufner, Keegan Bradley, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson. The sense in the States is that Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Hunter Mahan are almost certain to take up three of Davis Love III's four captain's picks. The one that remains may be a straight fight between Rickie Fowler and Dustin Johnson unless Bo van Pelt's impressive showing at Kiawah has handed the captain a fresh dilemma.
