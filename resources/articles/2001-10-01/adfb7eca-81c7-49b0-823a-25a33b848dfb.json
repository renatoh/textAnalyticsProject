Danny McCarthy walked about with his head muffled up. Esther Ferrer stood on a table, dropped rocks, muttered, and laid tracks of Sellotape along the floor in a continuous action about \"the situation in Afghanistan\". Invited to make a black spot on a piece of polythene if you were against the war, red if you were pro, young people bent down to make their black spots. These were just the warm-up acts. We had yet to see Mamiko Kawabata evoke her life as a sex-worker using wind-up elephants that \"volunteers\" had to place between their legs, the trunks becoming cocks that went up and down. And we had yet to spend an hour in the company of Artur Tajber as he danced slowly with a video monitor and writhed on the floor to industrial sounds, wearing a balaclava. The star of the evening was Roi Vaara, \"Finland's most internationally recognised performance artist\". He started with a film of himself standing about, which was almost poignant, but descended into bathos as he tried to hurt himself with kitchen implements, and then crawled the length of the space with a pyramid of glasses on his back. About 20 performance artists from around the world have been lured to this south London estate. Span 2 seems to fill a need. Where 1990s UK art was pop-cultural, clever, self-contained, this is passionate, expressive, lacking even a leavening of humour. It's about \"action\" not style. The lexicon of performance art has long been absorbed by artists such as Matthew Barney and Tracey Emin, whose work has a strong performative element but who would never dream of calling themselves performance artists. As a genre, it leads to a pretty obnoxious cult of the artist. Every element here was hackneyed or dull. What mattered was the ensemble of lights, cameras, action - a Wagnerian total artwork. All very well if you're Joseph Beuys, but not from those without his gift for transubstantiation. As for the young art audience craving intensity, commitment, vision - have they ever considered painting? Until October 27.
