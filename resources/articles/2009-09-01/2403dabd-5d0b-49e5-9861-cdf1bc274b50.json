For a whole summer, the book was in countless handbags and clutched by commuters around the world. Dan Brown's latest thriller is likely to be a another kind of phenomenon. It was six years in the writing and in that time a revolution has started in the book world. The Lost Symbol, to be published next week, will not just be available as a hardback tome but also as an ebook \u2013 tapping into a market enjoying fast growth in the United States and now taking off in the UK. Today sees the arrival in Britain of Sony's two newest ebook reading devices, and publishers and retailers alike are pinning their hopes on big Christmas sales. The Sony Reader Pocket Edition and Touch Edition go on sale in Waterstone's stores at \u00a3179.99 and \u00a3249.99, respectively. Despite the hefty price tags, the book chain is optimistic about what the new devices can do for its ebook store. \"From a standing start, ebooks have become a huge part of our business, and the fastest growing area of the book trade in less than 12 months,\" says Neil Jewsbury, commercial director at Waterstone's. \"We are approaching a time when it will be as normal to buy an ebook from Waterstone's as it is to buy a hardback or paperback book.\" Sony is also trumpeting a blossoming market. \"Since last year's hugely successful launch of our first Reader in the UK, we have watched the ebook market go from strength to strength,\" said Omar Gurnah, category manager for Reader for Sony UK. \"Our goal is to get these devices into the hands of as many people as possible, enabling them to read the content they want, when they want it \u2013 whether they buy it, borrow it, or get it for free.\" Publishers warn that the ebook market is still small, but they too report fast growth. Fionnuala Duggan, digital director at Random House, says that changes in other media markets such as music have made buying ebooks much more natural for consumers. \"The time for the ebook has really come,\" she said. \"There is now a huge supply of different types of devices.\" She believes that specially designed screens, slim designs and a range of ebook extras such as video have been powering a pick-up in the ebook market after many false dawns in the past. Duggan will not disclose sales figures from Random House but says: \"Sales are very healthy, they really are doing well and are ahead of our expectations. John Makinson, chief executive of Penguin, is more cautious about the state of the UK market, saying that for now the big growth is in the United States. \"Ebook sales in the US are 2% of our total sales in terms of revenues and are growing very fast, around 500% this year, having grown at a similar rate in recent years,\" he says. \"That hasn't happened yet in the UK, sales of ebooks are negligible.\" In time, however, Makinson believes the UK market will track the US, which saw its real take-off when Amazon's Kindle reading device launched. \"I do think the launch of the Kindle in the UK \u2013 when that happens \u2013 will be a defining moment,\" he says. Makinson says there are three boxes to be ticked for an ebook market to really gain momentum. This will require devices that consumers really want to use, a wide number of ebooks being available \u2013 and it has to be easy for people to download to a device. Another driving force for ebooks is likely to be the emergence of multipurpose devices that are not solely e-readers but also allow their owners to carry out other activities such as make calls. Random House's Duggan points to the wide popularity already of software that allows readers to view ebooks on their iPhones. When ebooks take off on phones, then sales will really start to enjoy big volumes, says The Bookseller's editor-in-chief, Neill Denny. \"The real story is two to three years out,\" he says. According to Denny erotica could be a useful driver for ebooks, \"because the readers allow you to read erotica on a train\". Another strong niche will be textbooks, which in their physical form are expensive to buy and heavy for pupils to carry round. Professionals, such as lawyers and doctors, who need chunky reference books are also likely to be a captive audience, especially given they already subscribe to online journals, adds Denny. For publishers, ebooks can offer attractive margins. At the moment new ebooks are largely being priced at the same level as hardback releases but the publishers save on printing and shipping costs. Still, in the longer term publishers seem to agree that ebooks will not gain critical mass unless some kind of value is added, and a wide range is available. Indeed, research from YouGov this week suggested that owners of ebook readers like their hardware but are dissatisfied with content. If an ebook is to get wide take-up, it has to offer something beyond the printed version, according to Penguin's Makinson. Books that are mere electronic facsimiles of the printed word have been around for decades and if readers were going to favour them over physical copies they would have done so by now, he said. \"It's had 20 years to establish itself in people's minds, if that's what people really wanted. It shows that people don't want to read books on screens unless there are other reasons to do so,\" he added. Penguin has issued a range of \"enriched\" books in the US, while Random House has released ebooks with video interviews of authors, animations and other features. But for all the buzz around multimedia ebooks and the newest gadgets, the printed word remains the dominant book form and will do so for the foreseeable future. Books are something people want to own, share and collect. \"A book is never going to run out of battery life, it's always there. You can rely on a book,\" said Denny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
