NSO Group \u2013 whose technology is reported to have been used against dozens of targets including Pakistani intelligence officials, Indian journalists and exiled Rwandan political activists \u2013 also claimed in legal documents that the lawsuit brought against the company by WhatsApp threatened to infringe on its clients\u2019 \u201cnational security and foreign policy concerns\u201d. NSO Group has never disclosed a full list of its government clients, but research by Citizen Lab, which tracks the use of spyware, has claimed that current and former clients include Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. WhatsApp, the popular messaging app, filed a lawsuit against NSO Group in October, alleging that the cyberweapons company was behind a series of highly sophisticated attacks that it claimed violated US law in an \u201cunmistakeable pattern of abuse\u201d. Among the alleged victims of the hack, which was discovered last April and continued for two weeks until the app\u2019s vulnerability was fixed, were 100 human rights activists, lawyers, journalists and academics who were later notified of the alleged intrusion by WhatsApp. In its first substantive legal filing in the case, filed last week, NSO hit back at WhatsApp and its parent company, Facebook, which it said were seen by governments as \u201csafe spaces for terrorists and other criminals\u201d who \u2013 without NSO\u2019s services \u2013 could operate \u201cwithout fear of detection by law enforcement\u201d. NSO Group also argued that WhatsApp had \u201cconflated\u201d NSO Group\u2019s actions with the actions of NSO\u2019s \u201csovereign customers\u201d. While NSO Group licenses its signature spying technology, Pegasus, to government law enforcement and intelligence agencies and assists with \u201ctraining, setup, and installation\u201d, it said it did not operate the technology. \u201cGovernment customers do that, making all decisions about how to use the technology,\u201d NSO said in its legal filing. \u201cIf anyone installed Pegasus on any alleged \u201ctarget devices\u201d it was not [the] defendants [NSO Group]. It would have been an agency of a sovereign government.\u201d NSO Group claimed that to challenge such conduct, WhatsApp would have to declare the \u201csovereign acts\u201d of those governments to be illegal. \u201cFor that reason,\u201d the company said in the filing, \u201cpermitting this litigation to proceed would infringe critical national security and foreign policy concerns of sovereign governments\u201d. The company also highlighted the role it claimed the Israeli government played in its review of NSO Group\u2019s business. The Israeli ministry of defence, NSO Group said, could have access to information about NSO Group\u2019s customers and \u201ctheir intended use of Pegasus technology\u201d. In a statement, WhatsApp said NSO Group was attempting to \u201cavoid responsibility\u201d and questioned the accuracy of some of the company\u2019s claims, including an allegation in the legal filing that Facebook had wanted to procure some of NSO Group\u2019s technology in 2017. In a sworn statement filed to the court, Shalev Hulio, an NSO Group co-founder, said that NSO had been approached by two Facebook representatives in October 2017 and asked about the right to \u201ccertain capabilities of Pegasus\u201d, which the representatives had suggested could be used to help monitor users on Apple devices. NSO Group declined to comment to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged meeting between Facebook and NSO, and said it would not reveal the identity of the individuals. WhatsApp said the description of the discussions were an \u201cinaccurate representation\u201d. It declined to provide further comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
