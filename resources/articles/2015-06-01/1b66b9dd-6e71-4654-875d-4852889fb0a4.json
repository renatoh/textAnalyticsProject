There are ways we can help women in science now", "bodyText": "If nothing else, the furore over Sir Tim Hunt\u2019s remarks in Seoul to a lunch of women journalists has shone a laser beam on the lot of women in science. I hope this illumination can stimulate widespread action in institutions across the world, eradicating some of the many manifest inequities women all too often face. Opinions have varied on just how unacceptable Hunt\u2019s remarks were or how much latitude should be allowed because they were a failed attempt at humour in an off-the-cuff, brief speech of welcome. (On Saturday, eight Nobel-winning scientists criticised the summary dismissal of Hunt by University College London.) Nevertheless, for many \u2013 though not for me \u2013 he is likely to remain the exemplar for all that is bad about the sexist culture that is still endemic in science, as across the whole of our society. But my interest now is in the future: how can we use the momentum gathered by the very public debate to make a positive change? \u201cJust one action for women in science\u201d (#just1action4WIS) is my call to action, asking individuals, within science and beyond, to come up with ideas to help. This is motivated by the hope that a real change in our perceptions and support for young girls and adult women in the broad domain of science can blossom from the current mess. On my blog earlier in the week, I offered some notions of my own. These ranged from \u201ccall out bad behaviour whenever and wherever you see it\u201d to \u201crefuse to serve on single-sex panels\u201d. The treatment many female researchers have endured at the hands (sometimes literally) of senior men is one reason why Hunt\u2019s remarks have been received with such horror. There is absolutely no doubt that women across society are far too often demeaned and harassed, as Laura Bates\u2019s wonderful Everyday Sexism initiative has made abundantly clear. The effects of sexism are, however, often more subtle. Problems such as unconscious bias, in which both men and women unconsciously mark down female applicants for a job relative to a man with the same qualifications, are becoming more widely recognised, if not yet eradicated. Dumping necessary but unvalued chores on to the women and thereby freeing up the men to do the tasks that are more likely to lead to successful career progression is one example of why the playing field can be so uneven. And what about the double standard of considering women who miss meetings because of caring responsibilities as \u201cnot serious\u201d while viewing men who do the same as little short of heroic? Such double standards are many and various, but also often invisible without careful inspection. They are certainly not unique to science. So we need to do better. My call for action, with an explicit list of suggestions, is meant to highlight the kinds of things all of us can do. By signing up to the idea, I hope people will become much more aware of what they can do to make a real difference to individual women and to the environment in which they work. I have been heartened by the generally enthusiastic way my list has been received. Others have added their suggestions or publicly stated what their pledge will be. I particularly liked the suggestion one tweeter made, challenging Google to update its photo gallery so that typing in \u201cprofessor\u201d led to images of women in the first few that appeared. If you think that doesn\u2019t matter, imagine you are a 12-year-old girl trying to get a sense of what the adult professional world is like. If the only images that appear against the search term of \u201cprofessor\u201d are either elderly white males or cartoons of men in white coats with sticking-up hair, as a girl you are hardly likely to think it is the sort of career aspiration you should be considering. Images \u2013 and role models \u2013 matter. On walls around labs and classrooms, we should go beyond the cliched image of Marie Curie struggling in inadequate dark corners and find current images of women. Why not use the #distractinglysexy photographs that have caused a rare moment of lightness in the Hunt saga to intersperse with the greybeards too often adorning the walls? Women at university and beyond might wish to pledge to act as role models and mentors for schoolchildren or, indeed, to anyone just that little bit behind them on the career ladder. However, attention has been primarily focused on issues in the laboratory and career progression for women. I have heard too many stories in the past from women regarding anonymous senior males (not Hunt, I hasten to add) patting junior women on the knee or habitually staring inappropriately at parts of their anatomy; of women being ignored in meetings or shouted down; of equipment mysteriously disappearing or never being made available to the women in the group. In such cases, it is important that bystanders who become aware of what\u2019s going on take the initiative to challenge the perpetrator. Some of the actions I propose refer to acting on a victim\u2019s behalf: to support them and remove the burden on them of being regarded as someone who complains or whinges, let alone ending up in a \u201che said/she said\u201d situation that can\u2019t be substantiated. More drastic action needs careful consideration and due process \u2013 rumour is not the same as evidence \u2013 but even a potential threat to reputation, albeit only locally, can be a powerful weapon. Less immediately visible handicapping of women can occur when they don\u2019t get appropriate credit for their work. Their visibility is diminished if they are never sent \u2013 let alone invited \u2013 to speak at conferences. Conference organisers as well as group leaders play a key role here. My pledge list identifies actions to ensure women are appropriately nominated and invited for lectures, job opportunities, committees and panels. Anne Glover, the former EU chief scientific adviser, responded via Twitter: \u201cIf nominating/suggesting a man for panel/membership etc, must also nominate an excellent woman.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. It could make an important difference. So what can you do? Whether you\u2019re a parent, a teacher, a researcher or a professor, I am convinced there is some action you can take to make a difference and help future generations of women to thrive in science. That way, we can ensure women fulfil their potential and are able to use their talents fully for the good of us all. Science is best done by diverse and inclusive groups of people, and best done when those doing it recognise each other as individuals who are not just scientists but also people with lives beyond science."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
