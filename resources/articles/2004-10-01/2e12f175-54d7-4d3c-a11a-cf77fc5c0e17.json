Paul McVeigh of Norwich, Sunderland's George McCartney, Steve Jones of Crewe, Danny Sonner of Peterborough and Portadown's Gary Hamilton have all pulled out of the World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan in Baku on Saturday. The five players are now ineligible to feature for the clubs in the four days either before or after the international fixture because of the IFA's stance. Northern Ireland's assistant manager Gerry Armstrong said: \"We have invoked the rule to try and make sure we get the players we need. \"If someone phones up and says they have an injury, how do we know they have an injury for sure? Time and time again two or three days after an international players are suddenly available for their clubs. It has got to be fair all ways for Northern Ireland and the clubs.\" The ruling also covers the fixture against Austria on Wednesday October 13 and means the affected players will be ineligible to turn out for their clubs on the following weekend. Armstrong is still confident that the Irish can triumph despite a weakened squad heading out to the Caspian Sea yesterday. \"We have some good lads here and the confidence is still high,\" he said. \"There is enough belief in the camp for us to go and get a result in Azerbaijan.\" Scotland have added the Portsmouth midfielder Richard Hughes to their squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Norway and Moldova, with the coach Berti Vogts beset by injury problems. Marseille's Peguy Luyindula has been called into the France squad to face the Republic of Ireland on Saturday to replace the injured Juventus striker David Trezeguet. Ireland yesterday announced that they will play friendlies against Croatia (November 16) and Portugal (February 9) at Lansdowne Road. Adrian Mutu is risking the wrath of Jose Mourinho by insisting he will play for Romania against the Czech Republic on Saturday despite a knee injury. Last week his club asked the Romanian FA not to use him for the match to avoid aggravating the problem. Mutu arrived in Bucharest on Monday to join the Romania squad, however. \"I'll play against the Czech Republic at any risk,\" he said yesterday. \"I trained for 40 minutes last night and I feel no pain. Such a match is too important for the national team, so I cannot miss it.\" Mutu has been out of favour at Chelsea recently but, with Didier Drogba and Mateja Kezman injured and only Eidur Gudjohnsen fit, the Blues have a striker crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
