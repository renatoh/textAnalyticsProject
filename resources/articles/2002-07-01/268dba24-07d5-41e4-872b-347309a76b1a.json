Reflecting on Turkey's startling third- place finish in only their second World Cup finals, the Milan midfielder Umit Davala turned his mind towards qualification for the 2004 European Championship. \"England? I saw their game against Brazil, so yes, I think we can beat them,\" Duvala said. England's qualifying campaign, of course, ends with a trip to Istanbul, and the days when they could sweep aside the Turks 8-0 without apparently breaking sweat, as happened twice in the 1980s, have long gone. Both Turkey and England lost only to the champions Brazil in this tournament but Sven-Goran Eriksson's side looked by far the less gifted tactically and technically against the eventual world champions. Where is the England player with the ability to control play in the manner of a Yildray Basturk or a Hasan Sas? Not to mention that Turkey's great strength, ball retention, is England's greatest weakness. As Ilhan Mansiz, scorer of two memorable goals against the Koreans in Saturday's third-place match, put it: \"We showed the world that Turkish football has developed in the last years, and other teams will have to respect us now.\" Davala was just as firm in his belief that Turkey's campaign owed nothing to luck: \"I think we are the third best team in the world. We play good football, in my opinion, and we played many good games.\" On Saturday, though, one positive aspect of their play came far too late. Hakan Sukur's goal may have been the fastest in World Cup history - after 11 seconds - but it was his first of a disappointing World Cup. Had the Parma striker been on song, Turkey might have skipped past Brazil into the final; as it was, when Sukur hit the high notes on Saturday the Koreans were blown away. First Sukur profited from Hong's ghastly error, in the Korea sweeper's last international, to score that lightning- fast opener. Then he turned provider, setting the extremely promising Mansiz free on two occasions, both of which ended with the long-haired striker wheeling away in triumph after smooth finishes. The second was Mansiz's third goal of the tournament in only his first start. \"Imagine what we might have done if he had started from the outset,\" rued one Turk. Another man left ruing coaching changes was Guus Hiddink: his makeshift defence was overwhelmed in the first half by the attacking flair of Turkey. The Koreans did strike back in some style, though: Lee Eul-Young's 11th- minute free-kick fizzed into the net and the Koreans' second-half onslaught, pushed on by a wonderful crowd, deserved more than Song Chung-Gug's 93rd minute consolation. Even sadder than Saturday's defeat for the Korean fans is Hiddink's departure. In a few short months Hiddink and the Korean people have developed a bond which will endure long after this World Cup has been forgotten. \"Korea has stolen my heart and I'll never leave it in that sense. I would like to thank the Korean people; they're number one in the world in terms of support.\" Hiddink has been offered a new deal by the Korean FA: \"I will think about it,\" was the non-committal response. His most probable move is a return to Holland to take over at PSV, although there has also been speculation that he might replace David O'Leary at Leeds. Some of the Korean players could well be following Hiddink west, adding to the country's European contingent of Ahn Jung-hwan and Seol Ki-hyeon. Hiddink would welcome such a migration but warned the players to think carefully about their first-team prospects because Ahn and Seol have spent much of their time at Perugia and Anderlecht respectively on the bench. \"If they want to go to Europe, I would advise them to go,\" he said. \"But they shouldn't go to pick up the easy money but look carefully at which is the best club and which is the best country for the development of the Korean players.\" Wherever Hiddink ends up, if he makes the fans there half as happy as he has the Koreans, he will have done a fine job. When the Korean players ganged up to throw their mentor high in the air in playful post-match homage, Hiddink received what was surely the loudest cheer of the entire World Cup.
