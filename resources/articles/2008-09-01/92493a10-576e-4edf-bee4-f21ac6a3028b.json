Two weeks ago the government announced a \u00a31bn rescue package to tackle the effects of the credit crunch on the housing market and help turn around plummeting building rates, now at their lowest since the end of the second world war. The fallout from the economic downturn and the government's attempts to combat it will be hotly debated at the NHF's annual conference in Birmingham that starts today (September 17 to 19). But how useful are the measures - such as raising the threshold at which 1% stamp duty is paid and a \u00a3200m rescue scheme for mortgagees at risk of defaulting - and can anything more be done to help social landlords weather the storm? Measures worth \u00a31bn sound impressive, but the scale of the problem is immense. One-in-10 households needs an affordable home and, according to the Local Government Association (LGA), five million people will be on social housing waiting lists by 2010 - a million more than this year. Soaring costs Social housing is faced with rising land and building costs and more repossessions. Planning gain deals - where developers incorporate affordable housing on new sites in return for planning permission - hang in the balance because much building has been put on hold as house sales falter. According to the National House Building council, just 100,000 homes will be built this year, down from 170,000 in 2007, again the lowest number since 1945. \"The irony of the current situation is that we simultaneously have a housing supply crisis and an affordability crisis,\" says Adam Sampson, director of the housing charity, Shelter. Sampson praises the government's moves but believes the solutions are dwarfed by the size of the problem: \"The credit crunch has ripped the heart out of the government building programme [to build 3m new homes by 2020], with social housing as much a potential victim as private housing.\" The stamp duty change means that anyone buying a house less than \u00a3175,000 will not pay stamp duty. The move aims to get the private market moving - which will have a knock-on effect on the creation of social housing - but, given average house prices, it is unlikely to resuscitate sales. Similarly, the Homebuy Direct plan for new build properties aims to encourage development by offering 10,000 first-time buyers interest-free loans for deposits. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) says it could provide a lifeline for developers, but questions how the scheme will be coordinated and marketed. However, the mortgage rescue plan - allowing about 6,000 households at risk of repossession to change tenure to low-cost home ownership or to social renting - has been widely applauded by the sector. The plan is for a social landlord to buy a property from those facing repossession at a fair market rate, with householders staying as tenants on affordable rent or part- owners with an equity share. \"We think it's more cost effective and more emotionally effective if we can find a solution that keeps people in their own homes,\" Orr says. \"It makes more sense to keep people where they are living, and they would potentially staircase up again to be a homeowner when the opportunity comes up.\" Meanwhile, the fast tracking of social housing money - \u00a3400m for social housing providers to deliver 5,500 more homes over the next 18 months - is a welcome, though bittersweet, windfall. The CIH warns that a sudden surge in social housing could undermine attempts to create estates with a mix of social and private tenants and result in problems in years to come. For many, the government's package has also failed to address the need to boost lenders' liquidity. With five of the sector's seven main lenders pulling out of the market this year, associations are struggling to borrow the cash to create affordable homes for sale that help fund rented social housing. As the sector with an \u00a38bn turnover appears to be losing its reputation as a safe bet for lenders, its experts hope the upcoming treasury-commissioned review of housing finance by Sir James Crosby will help restore confidence to lenders. Weathering the storm The CIH's chief executive Sarah Webb says that while the government's measures are not \"the silver bullet which will solve the problems in the financial markets,\" she remains optimistic. \"As soon as lenders get some confidence back and have worked out what their exposure is, they should be looking to social housing as safe lending.\" The Housing Corporation says associations can weather the downturn, thanks to strong rental incomes. Clare Miller, the corporation's director of regulation, adds: \"We would expect all housing associations to be continually monitoring their exposure to changing market conditions.\" Local authority housing professionals also feel that the government has missed a trick by not exploiting the potential of councils. The government announced moves in July to let councils create new homes through pilot local housing companies where authorities, in a joint venture with a developer, build both private and social homes that they then manage. But Whitehall has ignored demands that councils be allowed to keep tenants' rental income, which now goes to the government. The cash could be used to create more social housing, according to the LGA. It also wants councils to be able to borrow on the open market to fund schemes in the same way housing associations do. In addition, many commentators say the private rented sector is a fallback for families suffering mortgage difficulties. Bob Kerslake, chief executive designate of the Homes and Communities Agency, has called for a better focus on the rented sector. What Kerslake says is vital - his new agency is due to launch in December, assuming the dual responsibilities of the Housing Corporation (the regulator and funding body) and English Partnerships (the regeneration quango). As Orr has said, the \"challenging context requires radical thinking\" and the sector and the government are moving in the right direction. But there is no guarantee that the steps to combat the effects of the economic downturn on social housing will take effect quickly enough. There is also a fear that the cash brought forward in the rescue package will mean less investment in subsequent years, as happened in the 1990s. The government is at least attempting to sow the seeds of recovery although housing professionals will have to wait for the forthcoming housing reform green paper to see how the steps will be expanded on. For now, as Shelter's Adam Sampson says, worrying about whether or not the schemes will work is less important than taking action to try to solve the problems: \"Either we all give up and go home, or we grit our teeth and redouble our efforts to deliver the houses that we need.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
