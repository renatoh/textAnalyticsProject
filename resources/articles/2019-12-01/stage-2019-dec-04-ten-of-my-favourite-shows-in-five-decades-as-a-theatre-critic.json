Anton Chekhov\u2019s symphonic realism has never been better caught than in Peter Stein\u2019s production, with Jutta Lampe as Ranevskaya. 7 The Weir in 1997: Conor McPherson\u2019s tale-spinning spellbinder was unveiled by an exiled Royal Court in a room over the Ambassadors theatre to general astonishment. 8 Julius Caesar at the Royal Shakespeare theatre in 2012: an all-black British cast injected new life into this Roman tragedy and provided an object lesson in verse speaking. 9 The Masque of Anarchy at Albert Hall, Manchester, in 2013. Maxine Peake performed Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s response to the Peterloo Massacre with such vigour that it felt like a call to political action. 10 The Watsons at the Minerva, Chichester, in 2018. Laura Wade\u2019s version of an unfinished Jane Austen novel was a miracle of wit, invention and intelligence. Five things I won\u2019t miss 1 The ritual standing ovation \u2013 a filthy habit imported from the US \u2013 for even the most modest piece of theatre. 2 The sense of being pushed and shoved in cramped West End foyers by air-kissing, B-list celebrities on fashionable West End first nights. 3 The sound of plastic glasses being crunched under foot at the most crucial moments of a play by spectators who will apparently expire if they are not allowed to drink. 4 The growing use of mics, even in medium-sized theatres, to compensate for the failure of actors to learn how to project. 5 The delay in turning off mobile phones until the first words of a play have been spoken or the first bars of a musical score have been played. Michael Billington will be talking to Arifa Akbar at a Guardian Live event at Kings Place, London, on 3 February"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
