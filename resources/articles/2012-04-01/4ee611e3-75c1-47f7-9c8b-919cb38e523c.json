For those readers not yet up to speed with the fast\u2011growing social networking phenomenon known to adherents as \"Tittering\", I should explain that it is a global multimedia celebrity/fan interface facilitator that allows users to broadcast messages of 20 characters or less to the general public as quickly as they can whip off one cotton top to reveal the next one underneath it. Described by the self-confessed Titter addict Stephen Fry (who bears the simpering Lord Coe hologram of Designated National Treasure of London 2012, incidentally) on his own Titterfeed as \"deliciously, lubriciously, firm \u2026\" and then \u2013 after a brief pause while the lovable polymath attempted to work out which was the head and which were the armholes \u2013 \"\u2026 and spankably moist\", such \"teets\" (as the printed T-shirts are known to those who follow them \u2013 \"Teetmice\") are instantly sent scurrying to the four corners of the world by websites, newspapers, television stations and the handheld mobile communications devices, such as smartphones and semaphore flags, of people who are desperate that everybody thinks they are far more important than they actually are. Fans can then respond instantly to the celebrity teet, with a teet of their own (though obviously nobody pays much attention) and many Titterers have a wardrobe filled with \"predictive T-shirts\" bearing common messages such as \"LOL!!\" \"ROFL!!\" \"GENIUS!!!!\" \"Totally Lost The Plot\" and \"GB = PC Thought Police State\" which they wear at all times, even though it makes them very hot and sweaty like Piers Morgan, whose own \"teets\" are such a prominent feature of the bulbous new hyperspatial mediascape. \"It's a great way,\" another Tittering Premier League footballer, Joe Budgie, told me this week, \"Up loads of times. To get your message. Without your words. Out there. I've been stitched.\" After a visit to a nearby screen-print studio facility Budgie was happy to clarify his earlier statement: \"Damn! Put them on. In the wrong order! What a T*@%!!\" adding enigmatically: \"I \"heart\" Las Vegas\". Later Budgie moved to clear up any further confusion by Tittering from the training ground, \"Sorry! That was not. A message it was. Gift from GF!\" (Joe Budgie was speaking to the world in his role as nightclub incident ambassador for Financial Services Sans Frontier, the international charity that delivers free, independent pension advice to sub-Saharan Africa). Naturally not everyone is thrilled at the prospect of the Tittering footballer. The old-school Newcastle boss Alan Pardew, for example, has banned his players from Tittering after one of his squad inadvertently broadcast news that he was not in the starting lineup for the game against Liverpool by wearing a T-shirt bearing the name of popular sportswear brand, Bench. Titter has been around for a while now, of course. Veteran readers may recall Jermain Defoe sending a message to his girlfriend (\"Happy Birthday Baby\") via a magic\u2011markered vest in a game against Middlesbrough, Robbie Fowler showing his support for sacked Merseyside dockers during a Cup Winners' Cup tie and Ian Wright's self-trumpet-tooting vests commemorating his approach to equalling and then surpassing Cliff Bastin's Arsenal goalscoring record, a process that seemed to take at least a decade and a half. As this demonstrates, the T-shirt has already shown greater longevity than one of its rivals, Tattering, in which footballers communicated directly with fans via their tattoos. While undoubtedly effective, his proved too time-consuming and painful for most players and as one of Tatter's best-known exponents, David Beckham, was reluctantly forced to concede in his final \"tatt\" to the world: \"In the end you just run out of ski.\" For a while, some of football's tatterati attempted to continue getting their messages out into the world by controversially paying others to be tattooed on their behalf. This practice was totally discredited, however, in the so-called \"2004 tatter war\" between rival Brazilian strikers, Lothario and Ken. The mounting war of Celtic-style words ended when Lothario had images of the face of Ken and his girlfriend tattooed on the buttocks of 1,000 S\u00e3o Paulo tramps. Brazil's footballers were understandably revolted, and dozens registered their disapproval of the feuding forwards by having anti-messages branded on their pecs. And so it was that, amid the scent of searing human flesh, sanity was once again restored to the world of top-class football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
