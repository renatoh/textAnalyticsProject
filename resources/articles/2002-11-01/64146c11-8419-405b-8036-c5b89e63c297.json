The sport's governing body, the FIA, is under pressure from the Rally Australia, which is keen to swap its September date with Britain. The argument is driven by consideration of weather and conditions, with special concern from the manufacturers' teams regarding shipping between rallies and possible costs incurred on extra equipment and air freight. Normally the schedule for the world championship is announced in October. This year, with substantial alterations, it was promised in July. It has yet to be released. The Royal Automobile Club has fiercely defended its status as the concluding event, and very often the championship decider, in the past. The television rights holder David Richards insisted the championship should end in Europe while others argued that vile autumn weather added to the rally's character, if not its charm. Moving it would end a 40-year tradition established when the RAC Rally first entered the forests but opposition is melting away on a mixture of safety and logistical grounds. Fog and darkness are an intrinsic part of the challenge but they make it difficult to locate crashed cars or to fly rescue helicopters to the scene. \"We are aware there are discussions going on and have relayed information back that this should be an issue for 2004 at least,\" said Andrew Coe, chief executive of International Motor Sports, the present Rally of Great Britain organisers. \"There are some positives, such as the weather would be better from a safety point of view.\" IMS has every reason to be co-operative. Britain risks losing its round of the world championship altogether unless spectator control is improved after the Ford driver Carlos Sainz knocked down a dozen people in last year's race. In any case the sport's highest authorities are acutely aware that the world championship is excessively concentrated in Europe. Following the exclusion of the Safari Rally only four of the proposed 14 rounds for next year are outside Europe and at least one European event is likely to be discarded in the near future. Mexico, Japan and Canada are all pressing for inclusion. \"I've always said it would be a better event run at a kinder time of year in relation to the weather,\" said the Scot Colin McRae. \"With all the rain we've had, the stages are going to be atrocious with the double usage this year.\" McRae, a former world champion who will be one of the main protagonists when the rally starts in Cardiff tomorrow night, shares the widespread amazement that there is still no definitive 2003 calendar 10 weeks before the new season starts. On the basis of the most shambolic negotiations in memory, switching Britain and Australia for next year remains entirely feasible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
