Jake can't stand Sarah's fidgeting, so goes to bed far later than her, in the hope that she's already asleep. Sarah feels rejected and questions the point of sleeping together at all. He often wakes to find they're curled up on opposite sides of the bed, rarely touching. How we interact while we're asleep, experts say, is at least as important as what we get up to while we're awake. According to research at Arizona University, Jake and Sarah have fallen into a common destructive slumber pattern. \"On a day-by-day basis, there seems to be a vicious cycle in which sleep affects next-day relationship functioning, and relationship functioning affects the subsequent night's sleep,\" says Brant Hasler, the clinical psychologist who led the research. In contrast, happy and stable relationships are closely associated with uninterrupted sleeping cycles, especially in women, found a Pittsburgh University study. Dr Chris Alford, a sleep psychologist, says that relationships are particularly at peril from poor sleep because tiredness affects the frontal parts of the brain responsible for planning and self-control. \"Raw emotions get expressed, and men tend to be more direct, so they're more likely to launch into a row when tired. Women are more likely to ruminate on a problem. It's not easy to sleep when you're lying fuming next to the person who's upset you.\" It is in a woman's interest to make sure she has a sympathetic bedfellow \u2013 for both her physical and emotional wellbeing. According to another study, by Warwick University and University College London, women who get less than eight hours' sleep a night are at higher risk of heart disease and heart-related problems than men with the same sleeping patterns. And that risk is significantly linked to emotional stress levels, says the study of more than 4,600 civil servants. The answer may lie in the quality of our shared time before we go to bed, says Christine Northam, a counsellor for Relate. \"Try watching something you both enjoy on television before going to sleep. If there are things you need to talk through, it's much better to schedule a discussion early in the evening, when people feel less tired and stressed.\" Also remember that, according to sleep experts, happier couples tend to go to bed at the same time, even if one goes to sleep earlier. If you do want to guarantee shared restful sleep, one classic form of exercise may do the trick, according to research in the Journal of Sexual and Marital Therapy: \"Sexual arousal, and particularly orgasm, is associated with the release of opiates, which almost certainly contribute to the feeling of tiredness after sex. Endorphins released into the brain during orgasm have a sedative quality. Orgasm is also an amnesiac that can make you forget things like the stresses of the day.\" That's a fine motive for having an earlier night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
