The aim is to reassure sceptical business leaders that the government is united about its long-term, renewable targets. The deputy prime minister will insist disputes over the order of investment \u2013 in this case, on green energy \u2013 are normal for any government. He will also tell a green business summit in London that \u00a3100m is being invested in small-scale, non-domestic energy saving by the green investment bank. His move comes amid continued disputes over how best to respond to the Conservative backbench refusal to back Lords reform. Clegg will also warn the Treasury not to veer away from the green agenda. He will say: \"Consistency from government, no surprises; no rabbits out of hats. We set out what we're going to do \u2013 then we do it. It sounds obvious, but you all know governments don't always act like that.\" He will insist the government's emissions and renewable targets provide an overall secure policy framework."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
