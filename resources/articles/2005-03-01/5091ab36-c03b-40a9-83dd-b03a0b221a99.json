Hot. Desolate. A giant sandpit. Touch down. Refuel. Goodbye. But having watched all those airline passengers transiting on their way to somewhere infinitely more interesting, and mindful that one day soon the oil will run out, the good people of Dubai hit upon a plan: make Dubai infinitely more interesting, then maybe people will stay. And spend. And Dubai has certainly become 'more interesting'. Interesting, in a Dante-goes-to-Disneyland-via-Bluewater kind of way. It's the costas without the culture. A five-star, marble and glass orgy of ostentation, an arriviste's wet dream. And we Brits can't get enough of it. Last year, visitor numbers from the UK increased by 35 per cent, and hotels are running at almost year-round capacity. A change to the laws means that foreigners can now buy property. Premiership footballers are flocking there, undeterred by the emirate's strict (one would imagine) anti-dogging rules. Money is no object. Dubai wants the Olympics in 2020, predicts 100 million through its airport in 2025 and is hoping for its own Formula One race. It's shouting 'Look at me, I'm minted'. The sun shines for 360 days a year. And boozing is allowed. What more could we want? Much, much more, it transpires ... The Hydropolis Within two years, you will be able to stay in the world's first underwater luxury hotel. Built 5km offshore, guests will be taken to the complex by train through a Plexiglass tunnel. Rooms will be clear domes, and guests will be able to lie on their beds and watch the aquatic world drift by - taking the expression sleeping with the fishes at its most literal. The hotel will cost \u00a3300 million to build and have its own cinema, marine biology research institute and, even, a cosmetic surgery clinic. Artificial clouds, pumped out by a fog machine, will protect guests from the harsh midday sun. Rooms will cost up to \u00a33,500 per night. 'I chose Dubai because the people down there are so open-minded. They are like big kids,' the project's architect, Joachim Hauser, has been quoted as saying. 'It is the dream of all humankind to live in the sea.' A neat twist, perhaps, on the theory of evolution. The Palm Resort The Palm Resort is a huge man-made archipelago shaped like a date palm that stretches out into the Persian Gulf. Posh and Becks are reputed to have bought property, as have Anthea and Grant. There will be hotels, luxury accommodation for 180,000 guests and a water theme park with underwater reconstructions of the Pyramids and the Colosseum. There will also, obviously, be shops. Lots of them. Local environmentalists are the only ones not cock-a-hoop; they allege that the area's coral reefs have been buried under millions of tons of sand and boulders, marine life has vanished and sea currents altered. The World Resort God took six days. Dubai's developers are taking slightly longer, but by 2008 they will have created a whole new world, indeed a brave new world, as it will be sitting four kilometres off Port Rashid. The World Resort will be made up of 250 man-made islands strategically positioned to represent the world map, and will cost \u00a31 billion to craft from rocks currently employed as the Oman desert. Ireland is unpartitioned. There is no Palestine or Israel. A Richard Curtis kind of world. Access is only by boat or helicopter and having sufficient means to afford the \u00a322m price tag on the larger islands. Rod Stewart is reported to have 'bought Britain' for \u00a318m. It is rumoured, meanwhile, that a Texan millionaire has been busy buying Iraq. Dubailand With the ocean getting somewhat congested with palms and globes and underwater trains, the developers have turned their theodolites to the deserty bit on the other side of the main strip. Dubailand, due to open by 2008, will house, among other things, The Sunny Mountain Ski Dome, the world's biggest indoor ski resort, covering 1.4 million square metres. It will have 6,000 tonnes of artificial snow, an entire Alpine town and a huge revolving ski slope going through and around an artificial mountain range. Also under construction are a branch of London's elite public school Dulwich College ('the playing fields of Arabia'), a Manchester United Soccer School, stadia for rugby union, football and cricket, the Mall of Arabia (the world's largest mall, naturally) and a Formula One racing circuit. The Crystal Dome In February last year, construction started on what will be the world's biggest building. Biggest this, biggest that - yadda, yadda, yadda ... The Crystal Dome's 100 floors will have a golden glass spiral ramp form ing a necklace leading to the roof. Linking the floors will be 'diagonal spiral elevators' - 'one twist of the elevator gives a height gain of about 90 metres,' it says here - helter-skelter style slides instead of staircases and 'comfort car parking' at personal floor level. At a guess, there will probably be shops in there somewhere, too. The Burj Dubai It goes without saying that when the \u00a3160m Burj Dubai is finished in 2008, it will be the world's tallest building. The glass and aluminium tower will be half a mile high (800 metres) or roughly three times the height of the Canary Wharf building in London's Docklands. As insurance against Dubai ending up with the world's second-tallest building, the architects are designing the tower so that extra floors can be added when necessary. More shops here, of course. Sneer if you like, but I just love it Now, some otherwise pretty fair-minded people can be quite hoity-toity about Dubai. My peerless colleague Lynn Barber was a tad sniffy on these pages last October ... and it would take a brave - and foolhardy - person to pick a fight with her. And fair dos, Dubai isn't Tuscany, and it isn't Languedoc, but, most importantly, it isn't England in the middle of a dreary winter. Myself, I loved it. And so did my teenage daughter (and so, I can guarantee, will yours - with enough shopping malls to kit out a small European nation, this is teenage-girl heaven). And sure, there's bling, there's glitz, and then there's Dubai. The eye-wateringly rich Maktoum family have turned a small desert emirate into what feels like a mixture of Las Vegas and Shanghai - glamour, sunshine, showbiz and lots of desert (tho' no gambling, ahem!) all set against a background of apparently ceaseless development. Then there's the sport: top-grade horse racing, international tennis and golf. The Maktoums see their country as the all-year-round holiday centre, and stuff the Caribbean. The weather is superb,with a wonderful dry heat (though avoid July and August I'm told, when it's just too humid) and brilliant swimming and water sports. And you don't have to go over the top. We stayed at the hyper-tasteful Jumeirah Beach Club, 50-odd low-level Polynesian-style chalets, all with a private garden, in lush, jungly grounds by the beach. It was utterly relaxing and very stylish. The luxurious but intimate rooms are cool, impeccably furnished, and the three restaurants exceptional. I loved the gym and fitness centre, but there are squash courts and ATP-standard tennis courts, too, as well as a range of pools. And just on hand also is a thrilling 4x4 sand-dune safari drive, with a haunting desert sunset thrown in. You can't beat it. And you might run into the very best class of footballer - Manchester United love it, and so do Bayern Munich. A friend's son was given a Ryan Giggs Man Utd strip - but, the difference was, it was Giggs who gave it to him. Ignore the scoffers - it's a fabulous experience.
