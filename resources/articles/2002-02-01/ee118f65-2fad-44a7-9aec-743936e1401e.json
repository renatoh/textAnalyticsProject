They're also about as representative of the whole spectrum of gay travellers as Club 18-30 is of heterosexual holidaymakers. Now that the pink pound has become such a powerful consumer concept, the range of destinations offered to gay visitors either via specialised services or with an integrated, gay-friendly approach has been blown wide open, and it continues to grow every year as travel agents, tour operators and related industries (pardon the expression) bend over backwards to accommodate this high-spending, frequently flying and adventurous group. So while the well-worn gay ghettos in Miami, Manchester and Mykonos are still assured their futures, here are some of the fresher destinations for 2002. Cape Town, South Africa Cape Town is the new Sydney, apparently. The party capital of the first country in the world to enshrine the protection of homosexual rights in its constitution, the city boasts a gay community of around 100,000, a fabulous climate and attractions including stunning Atlantic beaches, the imposing Table Mountain, nearby winelands, insane nightlife and Africa's biggest shopping complex. In a few short years, Cape Town has become the fifth most popular destination for gay travellers in the world, and with burgeoning annual gay celebrations, a thriving Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and a good-looking bid to host the Gay Olympics in 2010, its rise has barely begun. So very gay is 'The Mother City' in fact, that Graham Norton is househunting there. Seal of approval or death knell? Decide when you get there. In a nutshell: A gay LA, but with character Web: www.cape-town.org Russian River, California, USA If you're more Great Outdoors than Dance-Till-Dawn, the pristine forests and river beaches of California's coolest gay destination are for you. The River, as in-the-know San Franciscans call it, is a rustic paradise of hiking, hot tubs, cute cabins and laid-back, 'clothing-optional' sunbathing areas set in west Sonoma County. A stone's throw from prime wine country, the area draws a mixed, laid-back crowd of all ages, mainly from San Francisco and the Bay area, and while chilled-out starry nights are a main attraction, the funky little bars of Guerneville provide plenty of social contact. Special weekend events for women and 'bears' take place each spring and autumn, and even the disco bunnies get a look-in with the now notorious three-day, al fresco Sundance party in mid-August, thrown in a meadow surrounded by towering sequoia redwood trees. In a nutshell: Best ever summer, er, camp Web: www.gayrussianriver.com Fort Lauderdale, Florida, US South Beach? So over. Key West? Pur-lease! Finally, Florida has a gay destination where being over 28 and under 44 around the chest won't draw withering looks. Hell, even women are welcome. Emerging in recent years as the Sunshine State's coolest hotspot, Fort Lauderdale is a bustling but relaxed centre for the gay or lesbian tourist who wants plenty of action without the intimidation. As well as endless bars and clubs, the city has art galleries, nature reserves and parks, and is close enough to take trips to Miami, the Keys and to see Mickey and Minnie at Disney World in Orlando. There's a special GayDays event from 30 May to 2 June, when thousands of gay men and women get to overrun the Magic Kingdom and other theme parks by day, and stay there after the family crowds leave for a series of massive dance parties. In a nutshell: Sun, fun and you're welcome Web: www.gayftlauderdale.com Costa Rica An oasis of democracy in turbulent Central America, Costa Rica has a well-established reputation for tolerance, not to mention laws against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, and same-sex couples travelling together won't raise eyebrows anywhere, although locals may be embarrassed by public shows of affection. Encompassing rain forests, cloud forests, active volcanoes, white-water rivers and tropical beaches in its 20,000 square miles, the country has an unrivalled range of landscapes, flora and fauna. The capital, San Jos\u00e9, though unlovely to behold, has a jumping gay nightlife and everybody salsas. A degree of caution is advisable as, inevitably in a country with much poverty, robberies and scams can happen. Many tourists are alarmed by the large, though not unfriendly, police presence. Then again, if uniform's your thing... In a nutshell: Gay-friendly rumble in the jungle Web: www.gaycostarica.com Budapest, Hungary Visitors to 'the Paris of the East' are often taken aback by the openness with which cruising goes on in public places here. Long renowned as a gay centre, Hungary's legislation is lagging way behind the lifestyles of many of the residents of the twin cities of Buda and Pest, and though male tourists will find much gay life on the streets and in clubs, homosexuality is still covert in day-to-day life. Lesbians tend to socialise almost exclusively at private parties and meetings, although the famous Angel bar on Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9g plays host to some women-oriented evenings, as well as drag shows and mixed gay club nights. Budapest's first Gay Pride festival, in 1997, signalled the start of progress, how ever, and the city's eclectic architectural charms and the vast Esceri flea market are rewarding attractions. In a nutshell: Welcome to the cruise Web: www.gayguide.net The Algarve, Portugal Although Portugal trails most western European countries in openness about homosexuality, recent legislation, followed by the inclusion of gay issues in films and on TV, is starting to increase its acceptability, notably in Lisbon and Porto. Not that this was ever much of an issue for the many men who take a quick holiday from the family on the busy beaches to seek out foreign male company in the Algarve's endless dunes. Idyllic Algarve towns such as Tavira, Lagoa and Albufeira are starting to respond to the demand and develop a quiet but friendly scene for discreet gay visitors. If all else fails, countless golf courses always offer an opportunity to give those pink clam-diggers an airing. In a nutshell: Quietly, quaintly queer-friendly Web: www.gayalgarve.s5.com and www.portugalgay.com Vieques, Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has long held a reputation as the most liberal island in the Caribbean, and the tiny, unspoilt islet of Vieques, eight miles off its coast, has become the sophisticated hideout for A-list American gay men and women, even though once there you don't need suitcases of cash to enjoy it. Rolling hills, beautiful, deserted beaches, stylish inns and an abundance of peace and quiet are the main attractions, along with snorkelling, scuba or body-surfing for the more energetic. As for nightlife, the brightest lights are the phosphorescent micro-organisms in the sea. A splash about in the water after dark will stir up a shimmering lightshow. In a nutshell: Low-key for high fliers Web: www.enchanted-isle.com/vieques Vancouver &amp; Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada Montreal, Quebec, has long had an internationally famous gay and lesbian scene, but Vancouver, on the other side of Canada in British Columbia, is surely finding its feet. This stunning city, sandwiched between coastal mountains and the Pacific, resembles Sydney, though sadly with a climate more like our own. Its small but vibrant gay scene, based around the West End area, ben efits from the city's multiracial culinary traditions, and boasts clubs and bars for a range of tastes. What's more, the world-class ski resort of Whistler, whose ever-growing Gay Ski Week celebrated its tenth anniversary this month, is only 90 minutes' drive away, and lesbian visitors flock to the picturesque, hilly Salt Spring Island, just off the east coast of Vancouver Island, a mixed but predominantly female-friendly community rich in artists' studios, beaches and hearty hikes. In a nutshell: Urban playground without pretension Web: www.gayvancouver.net Queensland, Australia Billed as Oz's answer to the French Riviera, Queensland grows into its name more every day. Beginning with the adoption of tropical paradise resort Noosa as the location of choice for post-Sydney Mardi Gras recovery, the state's dazzling coastline has become increasingly colonised by well-heeled gay men and women from the eastern states' big cities. It now boasts a string of gay-friendly spots, the most exclusive of which is Turtle Cove, a private resort half an hour's drive from Cairns. Nowadays Port Douglas, the Gold Coast conurbation, and even no-nonsense Brisbane all welcome planeloads of hedonistic gay tourists. July's Mr Gay Queensland is an annual highlight, but what truly sealed the state's pink status was the recent opening on the Gold Coast Broadwater of Palazzo Versace, a no-frills-spared wedding cake of a hotel, the only one in the world created and 'personally monitored by the Versaces'. In a nutshell: Sun, sea, and sauce Web: www.gayaustraliaguide.bigstep.com Phuket, Thailand Sadly, a massive proportion of the gay activities in Thailand have until recently come under the banner of sex tourism. But over the last decade local scenes have grown in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Phuket. A stunning island off south Thailand's west coast, Phuket has long been renowned for its perfect beaches, watersports, golf and ludicrously cheap nightlife. Patong Beach, something of a gay Mecca, recently held its third, triumphant Gay Pride festival, which allowed many gay Thais to meet worldwide tourists on equal terms. However, in a country where homosexual sex has never been illegal, homophobia is said to be on the rise, which ironically is credited as an adopted Western trait. In a nutshell: Pride reclaimed in paradise Web: www.gayphuket.com Tel Aviv, Israel When transsexual diva Dana International flounced to victory in 1998's Eurovision song contest, the public image of the Holy Land took on a startling new twist. In recent years the seaside city of Tel Aviv has evolved into a unique oasis of hedonistic progression. Devoid of a 'gay village' as such, the city centre is a lesson in closet-free living. Gay and lesbian couples stroll hand in hand, and the coolest bars and clubs casually blur every boundary. Backed recently by some exemplary legislation, openly gay citizens from every background - modestly dressed ultra-religious types and hedonists - share space on the beach and in bars and cafes. A word of warning, though: pack carefully. The strict 'selectors' on the doors of Tel Aviv's hottest clubs are seeking seriously dressed-up clientele. In a nutshell: Fruity cocktail in a sectarian state Web: www.israworld.com Mumbai (Bombay), India For those whose interest in gay culture is more cerebral than corporal, Mumbai represents a tantalising conundrum. Both rich in gay life and, due to its laws and traditions, profoundly closeted, the artistic and industrial capital of India is a forward-looking, cosmopolitan metropolis at the heart of an ancient land. Although there are no exclusively gay bars, cafes or bath houses, occasional gay events take place and it is possible to make contact with gay men, whose conduct is ruled by their being Indian first and gay second. As for lesbians, some women's groups are trying to identify themselves as such but have so much further to come.
