Oh that our political leaders, come the day of reckoning and beyond, embrace this collective spirit and get Brexit undone, facilitated by the public who will be most affected and finally get our country back on track with all its other myriad and complex issues. But then artists are creative spirits, who think outside the box. Somehow our politicians are relegated to the straitjacket of their own particular party box. Listen and learn to that clear message being sent, and in the memory and spirit of Jo Cox that we have far more in common than that which divides us, so surely parties can come together for the good of the country. Or am I just painting an unrealistic picture? Judith Daniels Great Yarmouth, Norfolk \u2022 A collective award is a great way to bring the Turner prize to an end. To paraphrase Naum Gabo, we have had enough of great leaders, it is time for a cooperative approach to art and life. Dr Michael Paraskos Lecturer in art history, Imperial College London \u2022 The admirable decision to award the Turner prize to all four shortlisted artists, at the request of the artists themselves, inadvertently throws light on just how outmoded and negative such a prize is. The Tate is committed to a democratic idea of art, and should use this year\u2019s decision to transform the Turner into an exhibition of contemporary art where participation is itself the prize, and the goal is discussion, argument and debate, rather than winning.
