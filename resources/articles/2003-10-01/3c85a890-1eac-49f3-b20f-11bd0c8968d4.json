The decision is an embarrassment for Henderson, which has managed Witan since 1909. The trust was set up to manage the Henderson family's money and was a big shareholder in Henderson until it sold out to Australian financial group AMP in 1998. In an unusual move for an investment trust, Witan said yesterday it planned to appoint an independent chief executive who will replace the leading manager for the trust, James Robinson of Henderson. The new chief executive, who takes over in early 2004, will carve up the \u00a31.3bn portfolio and spread the funds across a range of managers - although some will be retained by Henderson. Witan chairman Harry Henderson said: \"It is entirely logical to have the flexibility to access talent across the international marketplace. It is envisaged that Witan will continue to work closely with Henderson, who will remain a key element in the asset manager mix.\" Over the past three years Witan has been one of the worst investment performers in its sector, falling 32% compared with the 20% decline suffered by its long-time rival, the Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust. It is expected that the new chief executive will switch the management of American shares and smaller UK firms away from Henderson, and increase holdings in property. The loss of the full mandate to run Witan is a fresh blow for AMP, which is planning to spin off its troubled UK businesses - which include Henderson, Pearl, NPI and London Life - later this year. The Financial Services Authority finally gave AMP permission for the demerger this month. The operation is due to be listed on the London Stock Exchange by the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
