Behave as if you would normally, orders the photographer. \u201cWe could cuddle up,\u201d quips Arterton, \u201cbut that would give the wrong impression.\u201d She has just rushed up from Chichester, where she is staying with her boyfriend Rory Keenan, while he performs in a play. It\u2019s a reminder \u2013 if any were needed \u2013 that both women are busy, busy, busy. They have arrived late, creating a comic road-drama of their own as their respective assistants monitored their cars converging from different directions. Close friends since Button went to drama school with Arterton\u2019s younger sister, Hannah, they are in London to promote their first professional collaboration, Vita and Virginia. Button is the director, while Arterton not only stars in, but is an executive producer on the film, which documents one of the most famous love affairs of the early 20th century, the one between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West that led to the creation of the gender- and genre-changing novel Orlando. Based on a 1990s stage play by the actor Dame Eileen Atkins, the film ambitiously marries straight-to-camera monologues from the lovers\u2019 letters and diaries with special effects straight out of Guillermo del Toro. A pulsing electro-beat powers the louche Bloomsbury party scene, while Woolf\u2019s mental and emotional disintegration is signalled by a flock of attacking crows and ivy curling up a lamp-post or thrusting through the floorboards. \u201cI\u2019m really aware Vita and Virginia is an arthouse film and that enables you to make stronger choices, because you\u2019re not looking for a broad audience,\u201d says Button, whose most recent work, on the forthcoming second world war TV series World on Fire, has shown her what a luxury that is. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve returned to very often was the mission statement that Virginia and Leonard Woolf wrote when they started their Hogarth Press: \u2018Our object \u2026 has been to publish at low prices, short works of merit, in prose or poetry, which could not, because of their merits, appeal to a very large public.\u2019 They broke all the rules and pissed everyone off: they published every great modernist writer we think of as mainstream today.\u201d If the tension between those lofty ideals and the need to make an impact gives the film itself a certain edgy quality, it is also what brings the lovers together in the first place. Arterton\u2019s Sackville-West is a glittering, hedonistic aristocrat whose literary efforts do nothing to seduce Elizabeth Debicki\u2019s lofty Virginia until Leonard reminds his wife that they could do with a money-spinner. \u201cDon\u2019t forget we\u2019ve got Tom Eliot and Sigmund Freud to sell too.\u201d The point of the music, explains Button, was to find a modern response to how progressive the women were in their own time. \u201cWe listened to everything they were listening to.\u201d She also provided a lengthy reading list that not only included books written by the women themselves but several of the many hundreds written about them. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been such a nerd,\u201d Arterton tells her when she gives a particularly knowledgeable answer to a question about literary modernism. While Button did an English degree at Oxford, and was inspired to go into film by Woolf\u2019s 1926 essay, The Cinema, Arterton didn\u2019t go to university, beginning her film career fresh out of drama school as the head girl of St Trinian\u2019s and moving on to play the Bond girl Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace. \u201cBeing from a working-class background, and fluking my way into the middle-class intelligentsia, I still feel like I\u2019m looked down on,\u201d she says, not entirely flippantly. She began her reading with Orlando and followed it up with Mrs Dalloway, which is the subject of a pointed exchange in the film between Vita and a travelling companion as they chug across North Africa on a train. \u201cDoes anything ever actually happen to Mrs Dalloway?\u201d the companion asks. \u201cNot really,\u201d Vita replies, \u201cshe just gives a party.\u201d \u201cGolly,\u201d says her friend, \u201cI\u2019m hooked.\u201d Does Arterton herself resonate at all with those sentiments? \u201cI didn\u2019t study Woolf,\u201d she says. \u201cI was introduced to her through this project, which is really sad. I wish I\u2019d read her in my formative years.\u201d But then, she adds brightly, trying the thought on like a debutante modelling a tiara: \u201cI feel like the target audience.\u201d The Bloomsbury heritage is one with many gatekeepers and among those to have taken umbrage to the film is Virginia Nicholson, the great-niece of Virginia Woolf, who recently aired her grievances in a newspaper tirade. They ranged from the respective heights of the two actors (Debicki towers over Arterton, whereas, in reality, Vita was the taller of the two), to their dining habits (they would never eat in the kitchen), to the representation of her relative as a \u201c\u2018mad\u2019 prodigy, trembling with hypersensitivity\u201d when Virginia was actually pretty good fun. One could add that, in covering only the few years of the affair, it edits out Vita\u2019s major achievement as the gardener who created a new way of making, and writing about, gardens out of her disappointment at being booted out of her ancestral home. But at the time, she was mainly a popular novelist. \u201cI think she was desperate for recognition among her peers as a writer, which I don\u2019t think she ever really achieved,\u201d says Arterton. \u201cI read [her 1924 novel] Seducers in Ecuador and it\u2019s not Mrs Dalloway.\u201d Both director and actor are unrepentant, pointing out that they consulted the various family members at length. \u201cIf we\u2019re not allowed to take a view, with all the work we\u2019ve done and all the detailed conversations we\u2019ve had, what chance is there for a student in a classroom to have their own response?\u201d says Button. \u201cI could have made a documentary about her, but I chose to make a film. Art is an opinion and this is art.\u201d The film quotes Woolf\u2019s famous words on the writing of Orlando: \u201cI can revolutionise biography overnight \u2026 the story of a hero who turns into a heroine who turns out to be fiction, which is of course what all biographies are.\u201d This portrait of a poet who changes sex at 30 and lives for centuries was her tribute to Sackville-West and marked the moment when their passionate love affair cooled into friendship. At the heart of the project is an attempt to find a 21st-century filmic equivalent to Woolf\u2019s early 20th-century stream of consciousness \u2013 hence the crows and the ivy. \u201cMadness: what a convenient way to explain away her genius,\u201d says Vita of Virgina. The animations are an attempt to see female creativity and vulnerability through a new lens, explains Button. \u201cShe was this blend of brilliance and suffering. She writes in her letters about this sense that she is breaking with reality. What we\u2019ve tried to do is to look at her vulnerability in a new way, because, as a female director, I\u2019m extremely interested in the complexities of femininity. So yes, it\u2019s an attempt to break the rules and create a new language, just like Virginia did when she wrote Orlando.\u201d It\u2019s not a coincidence that Tilda Swinton also quoted Woolf\u2019s line about the fiction of biography as a key to her own inspiration for Orlando in Sally Potter\u2019s acclaimed 1992 film of the novel. A more recent interrogation of mythologising biography comes in Sally Wainwright\u2019s Gentleman Jack, an eight-part television series about the early 19th-century lesbian Anne Lister. It is the latest in a growing line of lesbian romances that are placing female desire in the mainstream. Is there a significance in the fact that these stories are being told now? \u201cI think we are both looking at compelling, driven relationships from a different era through a contemporary lens, and it\u2019s very important that there\u2019s space for both to be told, and that they talk to each other, but there\u2019s not a quota for female or LGBTQ-driven stories,\u201d says Button. There is only one sex scene in the film, though it creates an illusion of physical intoxication through the camera\u2019s caress of skin. Button and Arterton both bridle at the word \u201csapphic\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt has a negative spin. It\u2019s often used in a scornful way\u201d \u2013 while also being aware that the historical limitations of language work both ways. To describe Vita and Virginia as lesbians would be to ignore the fact that they both had happy marriages. \u201cThey were bending the institution to their own will,\u201d says Arterton, who remains perplexed by the emotional slipperiness of Vita. \u201cEven in her letters and her other writings she\u2019s very hard to pin down. I think what anchored me was something I connected with at the time of reading the screenplay: I felt kind of promiscuous, and that I couldn\u2019t give my heart away. For me, the key was her line: \u2018If you leave me adrift, I will hurt you.\u2019\u201d For Button, the underlying challenge was how to understand without over-articulating. \u201cA conversation I always start is if Virginia Woolf were to write Orlando today, what pronoun would she use? Would it be they? I\u2019d love to know what she\u2019d do with the grammar and how it would affect her writing. I think she would definitely have explored gender-fluid characters. But it would be wrong to impose a modern perspective on that, just as it would be wrong to use the word bipolar.\u201d Among the early outings for the film was a screening at Flare, the BFI\u2019s LGBTQ+ film festival. \u201cI was really worried about my mum seeing it and my aunt, who is gay, and all of her friends who are gay,\u201d says Arterton. But she needn\u2019t have worried. \u201cThey all came to see it and my mum thought it was really beautiful because you saw these women expressing something, rather than seeing something that was gratuitous. I\u2019d be the first person to condemn anything gratuitous: boobs out and that sort of thing. But it\u2019s important for young people to see something beautiful.\u201d Button says: \u201cPeople so far have said they sort of forget it\u2019s between two women. Their relationship was with their own sexuality, as much as with each other.\u201d She adds: \u201cThe response I love the most when people have watched the film is when they say: \u2018I didn\u2019t know anything about them and now I want to find out more.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Vita and Virginia is released in the UK on 5 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
