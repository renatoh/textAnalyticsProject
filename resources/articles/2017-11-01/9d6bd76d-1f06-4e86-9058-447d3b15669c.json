There are pulses, but they shift on their foundations; No Wonder We Go Under has a Larry Heard-style house bassline, but the lack of a heavy onbeat sends it drifting into the beyond. Frequent appearances of a quavering clarinet, hardly rave culture\u2019s go-to instrument, further enhance the very particular beauty of his vision, which, a little like Laurel Halo or his recent collaborator Beatrice Dillon, comes at dub techno with a jazz arranger\u2019s mindset. And while \u201cchillout\u201d music is often abominably unthreatening, Seaton\u2019s has a tinge of anxiety, particularly on standout Out to Rust, where held clarinet notes clamour and fret through the funk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
