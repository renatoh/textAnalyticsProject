Andrei Lugovoi, however, says he can't even remember whether he ordered tea during his fateful encounter with Litvinenko on November 1 2006: \"I remember drinking whisky or gin,\" he says. Almost 18 months after Lugovoi met Litvinenko, Britain and Russia are still embroiled in a simmering diplomatic row. It is reasonable to say that Lugovoi - a former KGB agent - is largely responsible for this ongoing war between Moscow and London. According to British prosecutors, it was Lugovoi who murdered Litvinenko, following their meeting at London's Millennium hotel. In May 2007, the Crown Prosecution Service charged Lugovoi with Litvinenko's killing. Vladimir Putin, however, rebuffed Britain's attempts to extradite Lugovoi back to the UK, citing Russia's constitution - leading Britain and Russia to expel four of each other's diplomats, and plunging both countries into their stickiest bilateral crisis since the cold war. Since then, the row has rumbled on. In January, Russia closed down the St Petersburg office of the British Council - describing it as \"a den of spies\". Recently, relations have improved somewhat but Lugovoi remains a thorn in the side of the British government. Britain's ambassador in Moscow, Tony Brenton, has even offered to buy Lugovoi a ticket back to the UK. Tonight, meanwhile, Lugovoi will be sitting in Moscow's Luzhniki stadium watching Manchester United play Chelsea in the Champions League final. His presence in front of 50,000 English fans is an uncomfortable reminder of just how powerless Britain is these days. (Lugovoi won't say where he is sitting but he is likely to be in the VIP zone, with the rest of the Kremlin's elite.) He is excited about the game. \"Two English teams playing in front of a Russian public. Marvellous!\" he says enthusiastically. Sitting in his office in Moscow's Radisson hotel, Lugovoi is unrepentant. He insists he didn't kill Litvinenko and says his meeting with Litvinenko on November 1 was a setup. He, not Litvinenko, was the victim, he says. Doesn't he feel any sympathy for Litvinenko? \"Litvinenko wasn't a dissident. He wasn't a writer. But I think he was definitely an agent of the English security services,\" Lugovoi says, adding that Gordon Brown should stop trawling for secret agents \"in the pub\". For a person accused of murder, Lugovoi appears relaxed. He is charming - smiling, joking, good-humoured and lobbing the odd word of English (\"absolutely\", he says with a cut-glass accent) into his Russian. Paradoxically, he looks like an English gentleman with more than a hint of James Bond - he's wearing a pink shirt, dandyish cuffs and sleek grey business suit. Surprisingly, given his status as a fugitive from British justice, Lugovoi turns out to be an Anglophile. He says that he still likes many things about Britain - whisky, football and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - a copy of the complete Sherlock Holmes stories sits on a bookshelf. \"I've read all of Sherlock Holmes,\" he says, adding that he is especially fond of Conan Doyle's dinosaur adventure novel, The Lost World. Lugovoi's own account of what happened with Litvinenko is innocuous. He claims he flew to London not to kill Litvenenko but to watch the Russian champions CSKA Moscow play Arsenal at the Emirates stadium. He is, he says, a fan of the English Premier League. According to Lugovoi, he and Litvinenko had originally agreed to meet on November 2 in the offices of a private security company, Risk Management. On the morning of November 1 Litvinenko phoned him \"at least five times\", he says, demanding an earlier meeting. They agreed to rendezvous at the Millennium hotel, where Litvinenko was staying with his wife and children, together with his business partner Dmitry Kovtun. \"Dmitry and I arrived. We sat down together. We ordered something at the bar. I've always said I can't remember whether I ordered tea. I remember that I drank some whisky or gin. Then Litvinenko arrived. He said next to nothing. He was very excited. Kovtun said he thought Litvineko was drunk, though we knew that Litvinenko had never drunk in his life.\" Lugvoi claims that this \"strange\" meeting with Litvinenko concluded rapidly. \"After 20 minutes my daughter arrived and came to the table. We were already standing up. I introduced her and my son to Litvinenko and we set off for the match,\" he says. The next day Litvinenko called off their meeting. \"Litvinenko called me at 8.30am the next morning. He said he felt ill. He said he wouldn't be able to attend. I went for a walk down Oxford Street with my family and we did some shopping.\" Lugovoi says he phoned Litvinenko again in hospital on November 7 (\"We had an excellent conversation\") and November 13 - the last call before Litvineko's death on November 23. He has stuck to this version of events since he was first linked publicly with Litvinenko's murder in November 2006, with Litvinenko's friends and family also accusing Putin of personally ordering Litvenenko's execution. He has given the same account to Scotland Yard, who interviewed him in Moscow, and in countless interviews. British investigators, meanwhile, continue to seek Lugovoi's extradition. Their case against him rests upon the lingering trail of polonium following Lugovoi and Kovtun - not just in the infamous teapot, but also in hotels, cafes, bars, aeroplanes and even a chair used by Lugovoi at the British Embassy in Moscow. (\"We had to burn the chair,\" one diplomat remarks acidly.) Investigators believe that Litvinenko took only the tiniest sip of poisoned tea. Had he drunk the whole cup he would have died within hours, his cause of death a mystery: the perfect crime. Detectives also allege two earlier polonium-carrying trips to London, by Lugovoi and Kovtun on October 16 2006, and by Lugovoi on October 25. They are uncertain whether these earlier journeys were dress rehearsals for Litvinenko's eventual assassination, or attempts to kill him that went wrong. Lugovoi, meanwhile, insists the polonium came from Litvinenko - a former member of Russia's post-KGB spy agency, the Federal Security Service or FSB. Recently, Lugovoi's claim that he is the victim has been gaining some ground. In an article in the New York Sun, the veteran US investigative journalist Edward Epstein claimed that Britain's evidence against Lugovoi was weak - and said that British prosecutors had failed to submit Litvinenko's autopsy report. Litvinenko was an international polonium smuggler, Epstein speculated. The Independent's Mary Dejevsky wrote a similarly revisionist piece, raising doubt about the British case against Lugovoi. Either way, none of the evidence against Lugovoi is likely to be aired in court. British diplomats concede their attempts to bring Lugovoi to justice are presently hopeless. Instead, Gordon Brown's faltering government is keen to draw a line under the Litvinenko row, in the probably naive hope that relations can be improved with Russia's new president Dmitry Medvedev, who took office earlier this month. At home, meanwhile, Lugovoi has parlayed his celebrity into a political career. Last December he became an MP for the Liberal Democratic party of Russia, an ultra-nationalist pro-Kremlin group, known for its parliamentary stunts. Fittingly, Lugovoi campaigned on an anti-British ticket. (I covered one of his campaign trips in the western town of Kursk. Here, Lugovoi cut an incongruous figure. Surrounded by middle-aged women with 1960s hairdos, he himself wore a pinstriped business suit and crocodile shoes. I asked him whether he had relished Russia's recent 2-1 defeat of England in Moscow, a result that eventually saw Russia qualify for Euro 2008 at England's expense? \"I had lots of text messages from friends saying: 'Andrei, this is your victory,'\" he told me.) Why, then, does he think that Britain and Russia are destined to be eternal enemies? \"Britain is a country that had a great empire in the past. You can't not respect a country that owned half the world,\" he says magnanimously. He adds, though: \"Britain is also a country that has created problems for Russia.\" This antipathy, Lugovoi explains, goes back a long way - at least as far as the Crimean war, when the British \"provoked Russia\" by supporting the Turks. Lugovoi also feels that King George V didn't lend enough support to his fellow-monarch and cousin Nicholas II, Russia's last tsar - whom the Bolsheviks executed in 1918. (\"George V preferred to see chaos in Russia.\") He also bears a grudge against Churchill for failing to open a second front against the Nazis before 1944. \"It was profitable for the British to watch the Germans go deeper into Soviet territory.\" As far as Russia goes, Lugovoi says that he personally never supported communism. But, he adds, like Putin, that he believes the breakup of the Soviet Union was \"a tragedy\", and that Stalin and Peter the Great had their good sides and bad sides. Like many KGB recruits, Lugovoi comes from a military family. One of his grandfathers fought in the 1904 Russo-Japanese war, his father served for 35 years as a colonel, and his brother worked on a Soviet nuclear submarine. Born in 1966 in Baku, Azerbaijan, he attended the elite Soviet military command academy in Moscow. In 1987, together with his friend Kovtun, he joined the KGB - serving in its 9th directorate, which provided security to top state officials. Why the KGB? \"They invited me,\" Lugovoi explains. \"Any normal Soviet officer would take it as an honour to be in the KGB. It means that you are the best.\" Lugovoi denies that he was ever a spy, and says that his job as head of a Kremlin platoon was rather boring. Instead of intelligence work, Lugovoi trained new recruits to perform ceremonial duties outside the Kremlin. \"I was standing outside, just like your guards at Buckingham Palace,\" he says. \"I taught people how to march - one, two, three. And yet people make me out to be some kind of KGB monster. Thank you, British press.\" In 1991, he joined the Federal Protection Service - providing protection for politicians including Boris Yeltsin and prime minister Yegor Gaidar. Two photos of his trips to Washington with Gaidar hang on his wall, next to a photo of Lugovoi fishing. Other photos indicate Lugovoi has a sense of humour. There is a picture of Putin shaking hands with Boris Berezovsky - once Russia's most powerful oligarch, now the Kremlin's greatest enemy, before the two men fell out and Berezovsky decamped to Britain. As a deputy in Russia's Duma, Lugovoi now enjoys immunity from prosecution - not that there is much prospect of the Kremlin bundling him on a plane back to Gatwick. Does he find life as a politician fun? \"I haven't made up my mind yet,\" he says. He says he is interested in security matters, and wants to improve working conditions for Russia's several million security guards. \"There is a great gap between what MPs earn and what pensioners get,\" he says. His MP's job takes him on regular trips to Russia's far east, he explains - to Irkutsk and to the beautiful, volcanic, and bear-infested Kamchatka peninsula. Just before my interview with Lugovoi, I bump into Dmitry Kovtun, his alleged accomplice. Afterwards, I find Kovtun sitting outside Lugovoi's surprisingly cramped first-floor office next to Moscow's Kievskaya railway station. Scotland Yard has not accused Kovtun of murder. German authorities, however, have charged him with bringing polonium-210 into the country. While Lugovoi flew directly to London from Moscow, Kovtun travelled to northern Germany on October 28 - leaving a trail of polonium on his mother-in-law's sofa (his ex-wife lives in Germany with her husband and children) and in a Hamburg government office. Kovtun tells me he is unhappy about the charges, which prevent him from travelling abroad. Kovtun says it was merely \"by chance\" that he and Lugovoi met Litvinenko in the Millennium hotel. \"We sat down and waited for Andrei's family to turn up. They'd gone to Madame Tussauds but they got lost on the way back. If they hadn't got lost then Litvinenko wouldn't have sat with us in the bar.\" But what about the huge doses of polonium found by British investigators in Lugovoi's hotel room? Wasn't this suggestive of Lugovoi's guilt? \"By the time the polonium was found, 20 days had passed. There was plenty of time for the British intelligence services to organise lots of things,\" he says. Kovtun's answer points to one of the weaknesses in the British prosecutor's case: that while there is evidence linking the two Russians to Litvinenko, the trail dries up in Moscow. It is still apparently unclear who ordered Litvinenko's assassination and why. There are numerous theories: that Putin ordered Litvinenko's killing; that the Kremlin's powerful and hardline siloviki clan ordered it, in order to precipitate a major crisis with the west and persuade Putin to stay on for a third term as president; that past or present FSB officers took it upon themselves to eliminate a despised traitor. Lugovoi, meanwhile, has blamed MI6, Berezovsky, the Georgian mafia, Chechen terrorists and even Tony Blair. The truth is only likely to emerge if there is a real change of government in Russia. For the moment, however, there is no prospect of this. Putin has just got a new job as Russia's prime minister. Most experts expect him to exercise a decisive influence on Medvedev, possibly returning as president in 2012. Lugovoi, meanwhile, can rely on powerful friends inside the Kremlin to help him in the event of trouble. In Russia connections are everything. I ask him if he had any difficulty buying a ticket for tonight's Champions League match. He smiles and shakes his head. \"I didn't have problems getting one,\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
