But many Cubans here in my home city of Havana have more pressing things on their minds. When last December, Obama and Castro astonished the world by announcing the re-establishment of relations between both countries, most Cubans celebrating the announcement \u2013 and the release of the three Cubans incarcerated in American prisons for years \u2013 hoped that the thaw would be quicker. For more than 50 years, the majority of Cubans have lived under the shadow of the American blockade or embargo \u2013 take your pick. They are just words describing one true, overwhelming reality. Because of that reality, which has built high walls of mistrust and scepticism on both sides of the straits, the process is going to be long. Cuba wants the Americans out of Guant\u00e1namo, compensation for the losses the blockade has brought to the economy and society, a total lifting of the blockade, being taken off the list of countries sponsoring terrorism (this last is likely to be the first to be solved). On the other hand, the US wants Cuba to adopt its model of democracy, a multi-party system and proper human rights. Many people think that dramatic changes will come. I don\u2019t think they will be in the immediate future. First, because the Cuban government has set the limits for changes, and second, because the common citizen has survival as the most pressing issue. No matter what the media say, most Cubans are more interested in getting by and improving conditions than in high politics. Such events have almost no impact on daily life. A handshake between Castro and Obama some place in Panama, no matter how auspicious it might seem, makes no difference to the fact that someone\u2019s ceiling is likely to fall on him any day or that somebody else\u2019s child needs a new pair of shoes. There are signs of hope, though. American politicians and businessmen and women are visiting the island in the hope of building bridges between the two countries. American companies are looking forward to the opening of the Cuban market to the US, trying to establish their presence here, and the sooner the better. We even had the visit of a rock band, the Dead Daisies, with members from bands such as the Rolling Stones, Guns N\u2019 Roses and Inxs. Cubans from three generations keep dreaming of a real and huge rock concert at Revolution Square in Havana\u2026 McCartney, the Stones, even Ed Sheeran perhaps? In my line of work, there are great expectations among Cuban artists, art critics and curators concerning the impending 12th Havana Biennial. American collectors, gallery owners and curators are expected to visit Havana during May. Cuban visual arts have been estranged from the American art scene and market, with the exception of names such as Sandra Ramos, Esterio Segura, Los Carpinteros, Tania Bruguera, and a few others. The excellence of Cuban art is well known around the world, although the US is a different matter. Washington has to get a closer look at Cuba in order to get a better understanding of its society and people. Most Cubans want a better life in all aspects. Better housing, better salaries, better opportunities for private businesses and individual development, travelling on our own devices and not as charity cases for friends or relatives abroad. Our doors have been opening to the world in the past two decades and they will be open to a new type of relationship with the US. Cubans know how to adapt to the unknown; we are creative, hardworking people. Changes are afoot. It is true that they are not as swift as we want them to be, but we are making them as best we can. Cuba has never been the utopia that romantics and the narrow minded around the world think and/or dream about. But it\u2019s much more than classic American cars, salsa music and Che\u2019s image on T-shirts. Today is a historic day indeed. But, at street level, Cubans in the neighbourhood have more pressing matters to deal with. Food, transport, water supply, blackouts, earning money and, last but not least, the finals of the National Baseball Championship.
