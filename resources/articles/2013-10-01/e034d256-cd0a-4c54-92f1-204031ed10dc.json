Founded by Sam Mendes, Pippa Harris and Caro Newling in 2003, Neal Street Productions is marking its 10th birthday. The roll call is impressive. The company is the hidden link behind the BBC's flagship The Hollow Crown Shakespeare films, the stage shows Shrek the Musical, Merrily We Roll Along and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the BBC's popular Sunday evening drama Call the Midwife. It is a surprising mix, and one that looks more unlikely still when you realise Neal Street also ran the Bridge Project with Kevin Spacey's Old Vic, brought the acclaimed play Enron into the West End, co-produced the film Revolutionary Road, and that for some of this period Mendes was off directing Skyfall, the Bond film widely judged the best of recent years. Such a turnover is only possible because Mendes runs Neal Street jointly with two of the women who know him best; theatrical impresario Newling, with whom he ran the neighbouring Donmar Warehouse theatre through the 90s, and Harris, a childhood friend and a former head of BBC drama. Of the trio, it's Newling who habitually strikes a note of caution. \"Caro is like the Scottish one in Dad's Army who says we're all doomed, and I'm like Captain Mainwaring,\" Mendes told the Observer. Newling, he recalls, taught him to \"consider the worst case scenario first\" in Donmar days. Harris, they agree, is closest to the poised and affable Wilson. \"We are all too old to be Pike now.\" This autumn their Shakespeare films are wowing US TV audiences, and a smiling Mendes admits that some of the broad appeal is down to the fortuitous casting of two premium British exports: Tom Hiddleston and Michelle Dockery. \"Shakespeare is good, but we have got Loki from Thor as Prince Hal and Downton's Lady Mary as Lady Percy,\" he says. As Neal Street enters a second decade, the three are co-producing a new drama called Penny Dreadful for the American network Showtime, starring Josh Hartnett, Billie Piper and Rory Kinnear, while hoping to see a green light for a Sunday afternoon series, Flavia de Luce, based on Alan Bradley's books about a girl detective. They have made a Call the Midwife Christmas special, and are filming series three. Mendes is stepping away to direct Simon Russell Beale in King Lear at the National Theatre in January, and to make the 24th, untitled Bond film for 2015, but he will still shepherd the next set of Shakespeare history films for the BBC. \"When I made Skyfall I was working on The Hollow Crown, too. It was something I wanted to personally drive along,\" says Mendes. \"It will be the same this time. I have a mini-crusade to complete the histories and perhaps do more. Last time I left each director alone, just as I would want to be left alone, and I will do the same again.\" Behind a camera, Mendes confesses he is galvanised by a \"large element of fear\". As a producer, it's different. \"It's excitement about other people's visions that drives me then.\" An early challenge for Neal Street was communicating this to potential directors. \"I remember whenever I was sent a script that was going to be produced by a director, my instant reaction was, 'Isn't it good enough for them?'\u2009\" Mendes is not the right director for some of these projects, Harris says. \"With Starter for 10 it was clear Sam wouldn't be right, and he agreed.\" It was this 2006 film, about a University Challenge bid, and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, James McAvoy, James Corden and Rebecca Hall, that launched Neal Street's reputation for talent spotting. This extends to directors and writers, says Mendes \"The actors are the shop window, but Heidi Thomas wrote a play commissioned by Caro, then a screenplay for our Middlemarch film, and that led to Call the Midwife.\" Actor Nigel Harman is another member of the loose repertory company around Neal Street. After starring as Lord Farquaad in Shrek he is now directing the musical on tour. Harris selected the Flavia de Luce project on instinct, and Mendes trusted her judgment. \"There was a feeling I had when I read the book. It was like when I read Jennifer Worth's Call the Midwife,\" says Harris. Mendes had an advisory role on Call the Midwife, looking over the script and commenting on director Phillipa Lowthorpe's first cut. \"I could see what her instincts were and I told her they were right,\" he says. \"I did argue there should be a title sequence, so people could settle.\" True to Newling's cautious nature, a decade ago she said she wanted to keep Neal Street small and manageable. Things are now stretched to capacity and so they have taken on a fourth man, Nick Brown, formerly of the BBC. \"A long-running series like Call the Midwife is a wonderful thing, but it's an engine that needs constant feeding and so it's great to have Nick,\" says Mendes. \"We are nice people,\" says Harris, \"but we are control freaks, and I would be unnerved running a slate of TV shows that I wasn't really across.\" Mendes also sees delegation as dangerous. Neal Street, he says, has turned down not just inappropriate reality TV shows, sketch shows and game shows, but some good dramas. \"We just don't have the capacity. Not if we want to actually enjoy it and contribute.\" For Newling, commercial theatre projects rely on her strong connection with audiences. \"If you are filling big theatres, you must be aware who is coming. When we brought Shrek over from Broadway we needed to know what to change. We had it on at Drury Lane for 95 weeks and played to 1.5 million people.\" Harris is more ambivalent about watching her TV audiences. \"The reaction is immediate now because of Twitter. There are 10.5 million people watching Call the Midwife, and a lot are commenting in real time. You have to be careful to enjoy their tweets, but then to set them to one side. You have got to trust your own instincts.\" Actors, writers and directors, in turn, seem to trust the trio because they're such old friends. Neal Street has remained a constant in the febrile world of entertainment. \"It is moving sometimes to think I have been working in this part of London for so long,\" says Mendes. \"I remember when it was all boarded up. There weren't even shops here, let alone fancy shops.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
