Vernon Unsworth, a British national who was instrumental in coordinating the Tham Luang cave rescue in 2018, insulted the Tesla chief executive and made fun of his attempts to assist by building a miniature submarine. In an interview with CNN that quickly went viral, the cave explorer said Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. Musk, who admitted that he had no idea who Unsworth was at the time, responded by calling the cave explorer \u201csus[picious]\u201d and a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter. To Unsworth\u2019s attorneys, Musk\u2019s insult was a libelous allegation that resulted in \u201cshame, mortification, worry and distress\u201d to Unsworth \u201cduring what should have been one of the proudest moments in his life\u201d. To Spiro, Unsworth\u2019s interview represented an \u201cattack\u201d on the \u201cgenuineness of his efforts\u201d. \u201cThat could not go unanswered,\u201d Spiro said. Musk\u2019s conception of himself came under close scrutiny on the trial\u2019s first day, which began with a lengthy cross-examination of Musk by Unsworth\u2019s lead attorney, L Lin Wood. The Tesla and SpaceX chief downplayed his global influence, noting that he has \u201ctried very hard to convince people to take climate change seriously\u201d with limited effect, and that he has no publicist or PR team. But Musk also conceded that dozens, if not hundreds, of people on Twitter had prodded him to get involved with the weeks-long rescue effort of the stranded Thai football team and that the Thai prime minister had requested to meet him when he arrived in the country on his private plane. The billionaire also admitted that at the time of his contretemps with Unsworth, he had a Google alert set for his own name, and that he watched the video of Unsworth\u2019s interview \u201ctwo or three\u201d times before composing his tweets. \u201cIt was an unprovoked attack on a good-natured attempt to help the kids, and [Unsworth] flat-out lied when he said we were asked to leave,\u201d Musk testified. \u201cI was upset. It was wrong and insulting and so I insulted him back.\u201d Another figure who appeared to have felt insulted by Musk was Wood, who took the cross-examination on a lengthy detour around Musk\u2019s characterization of a letter he sent to Musk. \u201cYou described it as a \u2018shakedown letter from a shakedown lawyer\u2019,\u201d Wood said, noting that Musk was actually unfamiliar with his legal career. The ensuing exchange prompted Judge Stephen Wilson to plead: \u201cLet\u2019s constrain ourselves.\u201d Musk\u2019s primary defense, which he reiterated numerous times, was that he did not intend to call Unsworth a pedophile, but instead was using \u201cpedo guy\u201d to mean \u201ccreepy old guy\u201d. \u201cJust as I thought it was obvious that he did not mean to physically sodomize me with a submarine, I thought it was obvious that I didn\u2019t mean he was a pedophile,\u201d Musk said. He argued that he did not retract his statement when he initially apologized to Unsworth because that \u201cwould have been worse\u201d. \u201cIf you call someone a motherf\u2019er, I think it would actually seem sarcastic to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean that he committed incest\u2019,\u201d Musk explained. \u201cThat would have seemed disingenuous.\u201d Ultimately, Musk argued, Unsworth\u2019s riposte and his tweet were \u201cequivalent insults\u201d. He added, \u201cAdmittedly, this is not classy.\u201d In another moment of apparent self-awareness, he said: \u201cThere are a lot of things that I say. Not all of them have the same quality of thought. I would say very little at all if I just said sense.\u201d The argument that \u201cpedo guy\u201d does not mean \u201cpedophilia\u201d was complicated by Wood\u2019s questions about Musk\u2019s behavior and statements following the initial tweets. Musk engaged a private investigator to look into Unsworth\u2019s background (the investigator turned out to be a \u201cprofessional conman\u201d), and told a reporter from BuzzFeed News that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d. \u201cI fucking hope he sues me,\u201d Musk wrote to the journalist. After reading the email aloud to the court, he added, \u201cI guess be careful what you wish for.\u201d The trial began with opening statements on Tuesday morning following a jury selection process that demonstrated the extent of Musk\u2019s fame. Numerous members of the jury pool disclosed business ties to Musk\u2019s various companies, which include Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, Open AI and Neuralink. Four potential jurors were Tesla owners. One man was dismissed when he said he could not be objective about the case because he is about to interview for a job with SpaceX, while two others were let go after admitting they followed Musk on Twitter and knew about the details of the case. Only one potential juror, an aesthetician, admitted to having strong opinions about billionaires. She was dismissed. Another juror confessed to both \u201cnegative and positive\u201d opinions about Musk, and he was allowed to remain. Musk\u2019s testimony will continue on Wednesday, when he will be questioned by his own attorney. Unsworth sat with his attorneys in court throughout the proceedings. He is expected to testify later in the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
