Tony Blair made a fresh promise to introduce the corporate manslaughter bill at the Labour party's national executive meeting on Tuesday. With the support of party chair Hazel Blears and home secretary John Reid, the decision to introduce the bill was finally pushed through the ministerial committee on the legislative programme chaired by the leader of the house, Jack Straw. The manslaughter offence would apply to corporations, including public bodies, and introduce unlimited fines if it were found a death followed a serious failing by senior managers in the organisation of the corporation. Individual directors would not be personally liable. Efforts to bring corporate manslaughter charges against Balfour Beatty and Network Rail bosses over the Hatfield disaster collapsed last year, since under current law it has to be shown the firm's \"controlling mind\", often its most senior figure, was responsible, rather than a wider negligence across the firm. The reform, fiercely opposed by business, has been pushed by the construction union Ucatt and manufacturing union Amicus. Ucatt's general secretary, Alan Ritchie, said it was vital the legislation was in place in the runup to the construction programme for the Olympics. Derek Simpson, Amicus general secretary, said: \"We have been promised this for many years ... We will be pressing for the bill to include provisions for directors to be jailed where they are directly responsible for corporate killing. \"If there are no such provisions in the bill it will not achieve the intended aim of changing the behaviour of directors and senior managers and improving the management of health and safety in the workplace.\" Both unions expressed delight that a central plank of the government's so-called Warwick agreement with the unions was being implemented. A government source said: \"We have promised this for so long that we could not look the unions in the eye if we did not press ahead.\" Another said: \"It is the right thing to do, but anyway we need all the friends we can get right now.\" Mr Blair has promised to introduce laws to hold companies that kill people criminally responsible in three election manifestos, and there had been concerns in government that the prime minister was again backtracking on the legislation. The government has produced successive consultation papers and last April last year published a draft bill. Last year, 581 people were killed at workplaces. The Health and Safety Executive found 70% of these deaths were due to managers cutting corners - in effect gambling with human life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
