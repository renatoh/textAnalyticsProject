Just as the fortunes of a club may swing wildly, so follow the earnings and profits. Aston Villa's own mixed fortunes on the pitch and in the transfer market have been tracked in its accounts: for the year to May 2005 Aston Villa plc made a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.5m - a massive improvement on the \u00a310.7m loss the previous year. But its fortunes appear to have reversed. The club is shortly due to publish another set of annual figures which will have to include an already disclosed \u00a39.7m interim loss. Villa's lacklustre finish last season means that much of this loss is not expected to have been recovered in the usually profitable end to their financial year. Villa can next year expect an extra \u00a310m in revenues following the renegotiation of television rights deals. Villa have also signed a new shirt sponsorship deal with the online casino group 32Red, thought to be worth \u00a31m over two years. So volatile is Villa's financial performance that City analysts do not publish the kind of earnings or profit projections that would allow buyers to put a price on the club. Deloitte's annual review of football club finances shows Villa's turnover rose by 31% over five years - but the wage bill also expanded by about a third. There are, however, ways of coming to a valuation. Businesses can be valued on their net assets, which are - in theory - much easier to measure than future earnings or profits. In Villa's case, the books - now more than a year out of date - show net assets of \u00a336m. This includes tangible assets such as Villa Park and the training ground at Bodymoor Heath. There are also other properties, which are thought to be the subject of much wrangling during the chairman Doug Ellis' negotiations. Land valued in the company's accounts at under \u00a33m is believed to be worth much more. This was confirmed earlier this month when Ellis, who controls 32.2% of Villa shares, won shareholder approval for the sale of part of a site known as the Serpentine for \u00a37.3m. It has raised questions about the true value of Villa's land assets. One source with knowledge of Villa's accounts and the properties claimed there was up to \u00a37m more in the club's land bank which was not reflected in the published net assets. Adding those two to the published assets leaves a figure close to \u00a350m - still shy of the \u00a357m price tag Michael Neville has put on the business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
