It was an eventful afternoon for Tom Ince, who won two penalties, and missed them both. He fired his first at Lee Camp but was able to convert the rebound, scored a second goal from open play \u2013 and then saw Camp deny him a hat-trick. The Rams won 3-0, and are now just four points off the play-offs. Reading climbed to third with a 3-0 win over Burton. Dominic Samuel opened the scoring in the Royals\u2019 fourth straight win without conceding \u2013 Jaap Stam\u2019s defensive nous is clearly rubbing off on his players. Huddersfield lost 3-2 at Cardiff, while Norwich continue to fall off the promotion pace after losing 2-1 at QPR. Second-placed Brighton drew 1-1 with Aston Villa on Friday, while leaders Newcastle go to Elland Road tomorrow. Blackburn gave their survival hopes a boost with victory over Brentford in a game that saw five first-half goals. Harlee Dean\u2019s own goal gave Rovers the points after Danny Graham and Brentford\u2019s Scott Hogan had both scored twice \u2013 Hogan now has 10 goals for the season, which will be cold comfort. Owen Coyle\u2019s side move above Wigan, who drew 0-0 at Barnsley. Birmingham moved into the top six after Che Adams\u2019 late winner saw off Bristol City, while Britt Assombalonga scored twice as Nottingham Forest beat Ipswich in the late kick-off. Elsewhere, Paul Lambert began his Wolves career with a hard-earned point at Preston, and Scott Malone salvaged a late point for Fulham against fellow play-off chasers Sheffield Wednesday. League One Tim Sherwood\u2019s curious new role at Swindon Town has got off to a shaky start. After being dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league Eastleigh in midweek, Swindon lost 4-0 at Rochdale, with director of football Sherwood watching on from the stands, rather than the dugout this time. Also enduring managerial uncertainty are Bury, who sacked David Flitcroft after the 5-0 FA Cup defeat to AFC Wimbledon. They technically fared better on Saturday, going down 5-1 at Kingsmeadow, and have now gone 12 league and Cup matches without a win. Scunthorpe still lead the way with Sheffield United up to second, but both had to work for narrow wins against struggling sides. The Iron defeated Oldham through Scott Wiseman\u2019s late winner, while the Blades beat Shrewsbury 2-1. Bolton saw off Millwall at home but Bradford were surprised by Southend, Will Atkinson scoring twice at Roots Hall. Peterborough stay fifth after Chris Forrester\u2019s injury-time winner for Posh at Northampton. At the bottom, Chesterfield have now lost their last eight league games after a 2-1 defeat at Fleetwood, while Coventry were thrashed 4-1 by Oxford. Jay Emmanuel-Thomas got the winner for Gillingham at Walsall, while Charlton beat Port Vale at the Valley, and Bristol Rovers drew 0-0 with MK Dons. League Two Surprise result of the day came at Home Park, where leaders Plymouth saw their 14-game unbeaten run ended emphatically by Grimsby. Omar Bogle danced through the home defence twice as Marcus Bignot\u2019s side won 3-0. Newport also pulled off a big away win, with Graham Westley\u2019s team winning 3-0 at Notts County \u2013 their third league win on the bounce. Newport\u2019s win meant Exeter would be bottom of the Football League with defeat at high-flying Carlisle. Fans making the long trip to Cumbria saw their team leading 2-1 with 89 minutes gone \u2013 before two late goals earned Carlisle all three points. Let\u2019s hope the Exeter fans at least left early. Keith Curle\u2019s team closed the gap on Plymouth, as did third-placed Doncaster, who also needed a late winner to see off Hartlepool. Steve Evans made a winning start to his Mansfield tenure, defeating former club Crawley at Field Mill. Leyton Orient\u2019s miserable home run \u2013 seven straight defeats \u2013 continued against Blackpool. Equally hopeless at home are Morecambe, also making it seven defeats in a row with a 2-0 loss to Luton. Colchester made it ten league games without a win in the cruellest fashion, letting a 1-0 lead slip late on to lose 2-1 at Yeovil. They fall into the bottom two, below Newport and Cheltenham, who earned a useful point at home to Portsmouth. Elsewhere, Stevenage won at Accrington, Aaron Pierre scored a last-gasp winner for Wycombe at Cambridge, and Barnet drew 0-0 with Crewe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
