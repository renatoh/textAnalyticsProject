But you would be wrong. On Sunday morning, I woke up early in a tiny bunk on a long boat, with a heavy head. My nine fellow hens were still fast asleep so I started writing notes for a PVP essay on what it means to be a good teacher. I will spare the details of both my essay and the hen weekend, but I have managed to survive both. The important thing is that, finally, with a hen weekend extension, I have put to bed my last essay of the PGCE course. With luck, probably the last essay of my life. According to a fellow trainee, we have written 20 since December. At many times during the past few months, it has been difficult to see the point of them. We all have degrees, so we have proven that we can write essays. We have all attended the lectures, so we have proven that we have listened and responded to all the required coursework. I guess we all thought that by doing school-centred initial teacher training (Scitt), we would somehow be relieved of the essays. But our lecture time is officially over and we are finally back in school. This past week we have been at our base schools doing more alternative key stage experience. Just as memories of reception class poo experiences were beginning to fade, I'm having a lice time in year 2. I love year 2. They seem (relatively) so keen to learn, and their English makes a gigantic leap forward during the school year. In a letter to (any) God this morning, several children wrote thanking him/her for their school and their teachers and their brains and their learning. An enthusiasm I would be unlikely to encounter in my year 4 class. But back to the lice. I'm not sure if I am being wound up, but at lunchtime on my first day, a fellow trainee came up advising me to tie up my hair as half the class had nits. Why had she waited until the afternoon to tell me? I had spent the morning leaning over the little darlings, with long hair dangling precariously close to theirs. So I am now suffering from the primary school psychosomatic scratch. Apparently I have been lucky to avoid this so far. My job-seeking remains ongoing; I am now juggling it with school rather than lectures. But things have been looking up. Scitt students are popular in this borough and I've had a few calls this week. It is fascinating travelling around looking at other schools. We have been spoilt so far and I have been intrigued by how different they all are. Luckily I have yet to witness a repeat of the rudeness of pupils in one school reception. Polite, helpful children and a warm atmosphere are so important in that first five minutes in a strange place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
