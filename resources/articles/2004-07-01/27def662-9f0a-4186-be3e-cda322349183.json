Linderoth played a major role in taking Sweden to the quarter-finals of Euro 2004, but on his return to Goodison Park made it clear he wanted to return to Scandinavia. Everton manager David Moyes said: \"Tobias indicated to me that he wanted to go back closer to home with his girlfriend.\" He was left out of Everton's trip to Houston this week to finalise details of the deal which will end a two year stay on Merseyside. He will become Everton's 17th recent departure, but the money from the deal will give boss Moyes some leeway in the transfer market to bring in fresh faces. One is expected to be Australian Eddie Bosnar, a centre-back from Sturm Graz, who could join on a free transfer early next week. Linderoth was one of Walter Smith's final signings before his sacking in March 2002 and cost \u00a32.5million when he arrived from Norwegian side Stabaek. A regular at international level, the 25-year-old midfielder struggled to find similar consistency at club level, never really settling and making only 31 starts during his spell at Goodison Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
