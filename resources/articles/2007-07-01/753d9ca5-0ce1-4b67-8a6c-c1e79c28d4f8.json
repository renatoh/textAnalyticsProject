On paper the match promised an entire tournament in microcosm. There was Paul Lawrie, whose victory at a storm-tossed Carnoustie in 1999 made him the last European to win a major. There was Justin Rose, increasingly seen as the most likely candidate to break Europe's eight-year losing streak. And there was Tiger Woods, the world's No1 player and winner of the last two Opens. Nothing, it seemed, could stand in the way of a dramatic confrontation. The outcome was very different and perhaps Woods summed it up by donning a pair of outsized black storm mittens between every shot in an attempt to ward off the cold that greeted the golfers when they arrived on the 1st tee just after nine o'clock. As far as the match was concerned, the gloves never really came off. The defending champion came home in 69, a more than respectable two under par, and professed satisfaction with his efforts. \"I felt good about what I did today,\" Woods said. \"I made two mistakes, on 12 and 13. But as far as shooting under par today, you always have to feel good about that.\" Those two mistakes - a bump-and-run from the fringe of the 12th green that stopped so far short that he two-putted and a missed eight-footer at the short 13th - were part of a run of three bogeys in six holes, the first having come at the par-three 8th, when he missed the hole from 10ft. To forfeit three shots in so brief a sequence seemed worryingly uncharacteristic. Woods had given himself a good getaway, too, making solid pars at the first two holes before striking with a 6ft birdie putt at the 3rd and getting himself on to the leaderboard with a wind-driven eagle at the 578-yard 6th, where he reached the green with a driver and a seven-iron and holed out from 18 feet. \"It was probably the ideal start,\" he said. The controversy over the free drop blew up by the side of the 10th fairway, where Woods's drive landed next to a skein of electricity cables laid in the light rough. By the time he arrived at the spot, an official had already made the award, judging the cables to be immoveable. It made no real difference: had the cables been moved, Woods would have been neither more nor less likely to secure his par. For once, he was followed around the course by a decent crowd rather than a multitude. And if the galleries were unusually quiet, it was perhaps because there was so little to get excited about. Rose played some elegant shots but fell back from two under at the turn to four over by the finish, ruining his round with a double bogey at the 18th. He and Lawrie both saw their approach shots slip back into the burn at the 3rd and the 1999 champion never really recovered from the resulting double bogey, although he finished the day with a defiant birdie. From Woods, there was mostly solid craftsmanship, which was not spectacular but may have been as ominous a sign as any. At the 248-yard 16th, however, came a moment of splendour that he might been better advised to save for packed grandstands under a glorious summer sky, with the fate of a championship in the balance. Facing the stiff wind, he smashed a low two-iron to the front edge of the elongated green, leaving himself well short. The distance to the hole looked to be about 1\u00bd cricket pitches; later Woods confirmed it was around 100ft. After careful consideration, and with his caddie, Steve Williams, holding the flag above the cup, Woods stroked his putt firmly enough to carry the ball up a long incline bounded by treacherous undulations. When it was still 10ft or so from its destination, Williams raised his arm in salute. Here was the proof of what Woods had been talking about during Tuesday's pre-tournament press conference, when he spoke of how his enjoyment of links golf had been kindled by his first visit to Carnoustie as a 19-year-old amateur. Playing the 1995 Scottish Open, he had discovered the fun of exploiting his creativity to manufacture shots that did not come from a coaching manual. It was a new dimension of golf and it continues to fire his imagination. For all the players who struggled so painfully to master the course and the conditions eight years ago, returning to Carnoustie this week must have been like being reintroduced to a one-time mugger newly released from prison and transformed by a decent haircut and a hand-made Italian suit. \"It doesn't compare to '99,\" Woods said. \"The course is hard, but it's fair. I think it's a fantastic test.\" And one that, over four days, he remains uniquely equipped to handle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
