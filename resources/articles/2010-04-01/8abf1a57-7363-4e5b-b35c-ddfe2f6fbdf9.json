The healthcare group, which owns 42 private hospitals and teaching schools in the UK including the Roehampton psychiatric hospital famous for drying out celebrities, said its partnership with the sport's governing body will be based around assessments and treatment for athletes referred to it suffering from a range of complaints including stress, anxiety, eating disorders and depression. Matthew Franzidis, the chief operating officer of the company, said: \"The athletes are obviously at the peak of their physical fitness and caring for their mental wellbeing will be our priority.\" Jenny Meadows, who won the silver medal in the 800m at the World Indoor Championships in Doha last month, welcomed the move. \"As an athlete I know as much as anyone the extreme highs and lows of this fantastic sport,\" she said. \"The highs such as medals and making Great Britain teams are shared by everyone but the low points can be tough to work through. I think it is fantastic that we are leaving no stones unturned in the support for athletes in the approach to 2012.\" The group's flagship hospital in south\u2011west London was founded in 1872 and although it is the capital's oldest private psychiatric hospital, up to half the inpatients using its 107 beds are referred there by the NHS and therefore do not pay for treatment. But the hospital became a household name over the past decade because of those high-profile patients who do fund their own rehabilitation from drug or alcohol addiction and pay about \u00a34,000 a week for the provision of care and therapy for mental health issues. From sport these have included Frank Bruno, Paul Gascoigne and the late George Best. Other celebrity patients such as Robbie Williams, Kate Moss, Pete Doherty, Michael Barrymore and Kerry Katona have also inspired the paparazzi to surround the hospital gates in recent years, looking for shots to accompany lurid tabloid revelations. In the build-up to 2012, it seems UK Athletics is determined to provide emotional support for its competitors \u2013 not so much a case of relying on Citius, Altius, Fortius any longer but adding mens sana in corpore sano to the Games motto."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
