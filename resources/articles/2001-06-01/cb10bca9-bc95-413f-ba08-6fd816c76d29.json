Analysts said the market was becoming increasingly convinced that the government would not push for early euro membership, and sterling climbed above $1.40 in response. The market mood was reinforced by comments from the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, who warned again that sterling's high level against the euro was a serious obstacle to early entry. Speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner, Sir Eddie welcomed the government's \"considered and cautious\" approach to assessing whether Britain was ready to join the euro, the policy spelt out earlier in the evening at the same event by Mr Brown. \"I see the present environment, and in particular the euro's present weakness, as a potentially serious obstacle to early entry,\" he said. Mr Brown, in an otherwise pro-European speech, hinted the government was in no hurry to complete the assessment of the Treasury's five economic tests. Pro-euro campaigners were disappointed but tried to put a brave face on it by saying Mr Brown's speech did not change existing government policy. \"We should only join the euro if the economics are right, and the government has said they will assess the tests in the next two years,\" said Kitty Ussher, chief economist for Britain in Europe. But opponents of British entry said the chancellor's cautious tone was deliberate. \"I think Mr Brown is just playing a cautious game, waiting to see whether there is an economic window of opportunity in the next year.\" said Dominic Cummings, director for the No campaign. \"None of this changes the fact that we expect the government to decide about euro entry by spring next year, and if the economic opportunity is not there, they will bury the issue for ever.\" Although Britain has had a better record on controlling inflation than the economies of the eurozone, Sir Eddie warned last night that growing imbalances between the domestic and traded parts of the economy exposed Britain to the risk of sudden fall in sterling that would fuel price pressures. \"At some point the elastic is likely to break, possibly through a sharp exchange rate adjustment. At that point, having deliberately stimulated domestic demand growth, we would need to rein it back.\" Meanwhile Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told senators that there were little signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy. He credited the fact that higher prices for energy and other commodities were hitting profit margins rather than prices. \"We see no evidence that those costs are being passed through to final prices.\" His comments, made to the Senate Banking committee, provided some cheer to analysts expecting the Fed to cut rates for the sixth time at next week's two-day meeting. Yesterday's meeting, Mr Greenspan's first in front of a Democratically-controlled committee for seven years, was less confrontational than expected. Senator Paul Sarbanes, a critic of Mr Greenspan for failing to cut rates quickly enough, appeared content to probe him on interest rate policy and banking issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
