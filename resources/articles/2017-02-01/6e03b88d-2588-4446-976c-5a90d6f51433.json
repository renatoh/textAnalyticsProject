Everton have been in talks for several months over a new deal for the Premier League\u2019s leading goalscorer with Lukaku\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola, announcing before Christmas: \u201cWe have 99.9% reached terms.\u201d Eight weeks on, and with Lukaku\u2019s value to Everton continuing to rise, no agreement has been reached. Raiola insisted on Thursday there were \u201cno problems right now between the player and the club \u2013 he will sign\u201d. Koeman, while happy to delegate contract business and transfer deals to the director of football, Steve Walsh, and the board, will request an explanation for the hold-up after Saturday\u2019s Premier League visit to Middlesbrough. \u201cI don\u2019t believe agents,\u201d the Everton manager said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is happening. I wouldn\u2019t say anything now [to the board] but maybe after the weekend, yes. It\u2019s no issue for now. Playing on Saturday is more important. It would be really good and important for the club, for the team and for me [should Lukaku sign] because it means we can keep the best players and he has seen a future in this club. That is really positive.\u201d Lukaku\u2019s four-goal haul in the 6-3 victory over of Bournemouth last Saturday took him top of the scoring chart on 16 and second in Everton\u2019s all-time list of Premier League goalscorers, one behind Duncan Ferguson\u2019s total of 60. Ferguson\u2019s tally came from 239 league appearances whereas Lukaku, who has two years remaining on his current contract, has reached 59 goals in 126 league outings for Everton. Still only 23, the striker has a superior shooting accuracy this season \u2013 64% \u2013 to Diego Costa, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Harry Kane. That aspect of his game, admits Koeman, would not look out of place alongside Marco van Basten, Rom\u00e1rio and other great forwards from the Everton manager\u2019s playing career, though he insists improvement is required elsewhere. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best, even comparing him to the players in my time,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cHe is world class in his finishing. He is that good but he needs to improve in a total picture of a player \u2013 but that part of him is world class. It is always a good ambition of a striker to be top scorer in the league. The four goals he scored will be a real boost for the player but sometimes you can focus too much on scoring. Focus on the team, focus on the job you need to do when we don\u2019t have the ball and focus on your movements. We know if we give him the chances normally he will score the goals. That\u2019s more important than to focus on scoring goals.\u201d Only Tottenham Hotspur have won more Premier League points in 2017 than Everton\u2019s 13 but Koeman\u2019s team remain seventh, five points behind Manchester United in sixth and seven points off Champions League qualification. Although refusing to look beyond Middlesbrough, the Everton manager believes a challenge to the top four is not inconceivable. \u201cWho is playing like a top-four team? The top four? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the first, second, third and fourth are playing like top teams. All of them, except Chelsea and Tottenham, have difficult times and it is not that the first four teams are all playing the best football at the moment. No. I have that feeling [of qualifying for Europe] but it is always more difficult to show it than to talk about it. If we can keep our fitness, and I\u2019m sure we can, then with how the team is improving offensively I think we do have opportunities. \u201cThere is a high confidence in the team and the team is understanding how we like to play. A good quality of the team is that we can change our system and everybody knows what to do in a different system and that makes it difficult for our opponents because they don\u2019t know what system we will play and then we can change with little notice in a game. We don\u2019t need a long time to settle into a new system. That was evident against Bournemouth \u2013 that\u2019s what you want. From the moment we changed the team looked more comfortable and started scoring goals again. I am a fan of different systems, and also in training sessions we play out of different systems. We change and everybody knows what their function is in a different system.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
