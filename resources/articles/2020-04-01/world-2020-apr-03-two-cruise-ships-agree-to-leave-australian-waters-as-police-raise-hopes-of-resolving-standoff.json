But one cruise line, believed to be Carnival, had asked to keep some ships in Australian waters, the head of Australian Border Force, Michael Outram, revealed. Discussions were continuing on Friday morning. The New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, who has been given responsibility for dealing with the eight cruise ships off the state\u2019s coast, said at his regular Friday morning briefing it had been a \u201cpositive day with border force, and two cruise liners are currently under way and out of NSW waters\u201d. Fuller thanked Carnival. The Pacific Explorer, owned by P&amp;O/Carnival, and Carnival Splendour both appeared to be heading north along the coast on Friday. Fuller said the government was now planning for Royal Caribbean\u2019s five ships to be refuelled, restocked with healthy crew and to head to their port of origin by Sunday. The Ovation of the Seas came into Sydney Harbour on Thursday night to refuel. The Spectrum of the Seas remained off the coast. Fuller said the situation with the Ruby Princess, which also remained offshore, was \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d. A private medical company, Aspen Medical, had been contracted to undertake medical assessments and visited the Ruby Princess on Thursday. The Ruby Princess had an outbreak of coronavirus among its passengers after they disembarked in Sydney on 19 March, leading to more than 340 cases in NSW and more than 200 more in other states \u2013 more than 10% of Australia\u2019s cases overall. Since then several crew members had been taken from the ship for medical treatment. Fuller said one man was taken off on Thursday who needed more intense medical assistance. \u201cWe will continue to take anyone off those ships who requires NSW health assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for an update from Aspen in relation to the Ruby Princess and the condition of the crew. However, again, I can say that after their initial inquiry, no additional crew members needed to come off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are monitoring that regularly, and ports and police maritime will continue close contact with the captain of the ship and border force. We\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. Outram told Channel 7\u2019s Sunrise that five members of the Aspen medical team, along with border force officers, had attended the Ruby Princess. \u201cThe purpose wasn\u2019t to assess all of the crew, it was to work with the medic, with the ship\u2019s master, and to get a general assessment of what was going on,\u201d he said. He said he expected a further report on Friday, but given what had happened with the Ruby Princess it would be no surprise to see further cases among the crew members. He said Fuller was right to worry about whether the NSW healthcare system would be able to cope with infections among the cruise ship crews, but there was also a duty of care owed to those on the ships. There were still 21 cruise ships in Australian waters. The government imposed a 30-day ban on foreign ships docking in Australian ports in March, but made exceptions for three ships that were already on their way, including Ruby Princess. Outram said: \u201cWhen the ban was put on cruise ships in the first place, the reason was because we were acutely aware all of these three ships with their passengers and crew could create a catastrophic effect on the Australian health system if they stay in our waters. \u201cWe have managed to get rid of all of the passengers. You are still left with the crew in our waters. We want to get the ships gone, but of course, in doing so, we have to ensure we are not sending them into danger. We want to make sure we get the ships gone as soon as possible, but at the same time that we don\u2019t put people in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Outram said they should go back to their home ports. \u201cThis concept of a home port isn\u2019t an abstract concept. If ever there was a time for ships to go back to where they\u2019re registered, it\u2019s a time of a global pandemic.\u201d He said a number of them had sought permission to stay. \u201cWe are now working through that. A couple of large companies that we have worked with, like Royal Caribbean, they have been proactive in trying to get their ships out of our waters. Now we\u2019re working with Carnival ships as well,\u201d Outram said. \u201cMy position is if their ships have no reason to be in our waters, if the crew are well, they need to move on,\u201d he said. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, again defended NSW Health\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess saga, saying state \u201cauthorities had followed all existing protocols\u201d. But she said she had asked Fuller to conduct an investigation into what had occurred."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
