The 26-year-old has made an inconsistent start to the season, producing a sublime save to secure victory against Southampton on the opening day but causing anxiety in the Liverpool defence through failing to command his penalty area. That problem prompted a withering rebuke from Steven Gerrard during Tuesday\u2019s Champions League win over Ludogorets Razgrad, when the keeper\u2019s positioning for Dani Abalo\u2019s 90th-minute equaliser also came in for criticism. V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s has been linked with Anfield and the former Barcelona keeper is a free agent after his proposed move to Monaco collapsed in July when he failed a medical. Rodgers has distanced himself from a move for Vald\u00e9s in the past but, providing the 32-year-old proves by October that he has recovered from a cruciate ligament rupture, seven months after suffering the injury against Celta Vigo, Liverpool are likely to offer the Spaniard a contract. Rodgers bought Mignolet to replace Pepe Reina only last summer and, while standing by the \u00a39m signing from Sunderland, was equivocal on Friday in his backing of the Belgian. \u201cHe\u2019s our No1 keeper, he\u2019s got plenty of experience,\u201d said the Liverpool manager. \u201cHe just needs to continue working on that relationship with the back four and deal with that. \u201cI think the key thing, and the message to all the players in that situation, is to make sure you are on the front foot. Be aggressive, don\u2019t wait for it [the ball in the area]. He\u2019s a bit of a laid-back type of person in his personality, but I think he\u2019s aggressive [as a goalkeeper].\u201d Asked if he was looking for more from Mignolet, Rodgers replied: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell you if I was.\u201d Liverpool collectively struggled with set pieces during the home defeat by Aston Villa last weekend but, with another test likely on Saturday against Sam Allardyce\u2019s West Ham United, Rodgers denies opponents have identified a weakness in his team\u2019s defending. The manager, who has Martin Skrtel available again after the centre-half missed the past three matches with injury, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Aston Villa targeted us with set pieces, we just didn\u2019t defend them well enough. I thought we brought nerves on ourselves. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have played against a bigger team the week before than Tottenham. In terms of taking their big players on we were excellent. I just thought that we brought the nerves on ourselves at corners against Villa. We have talked about getting organised quickly in the game, and doing your job, making sure your marker doesn\u2019t get in front of you. These are the things that we have spoken about. I don\u2019t think they particularly targeted us, it\u2019s just the nature of the game. The ball goes out, it\u2019s a corner, the ball comes into the box, we defend it. At times we didn\u2019t defend it well enough.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
