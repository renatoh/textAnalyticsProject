I am a child of Watchdog, That\u2019s Life! and Nationwide (and later would graduate to the gangster noir of The Cook Report \u2013 but those were darker times), and of the parody sketches that naturally accompanied the genre in its late-1980s heyday. The vision of Lynn Faulds-Wood on French and Saunders tearing open marshmallows to reveal razor blades inside \u2013 \u201cAnd these are being sold to children\u201d \u2013 lives on happily in memory. So I am delighted that the modern version, Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back (Channel 4), has returned for a second series, channelling all the best aspects of the originals. Its magazine-y format allows it to bob back and forth between serious and trivial cases, a spot of audience interaction and a sense of warmth emanating from the host. Comedian Lycett has a fairly retro vibe, with a soft campness, a genuine but never scathing wit and a willingness to engage seriously with his subject when required, primarily during the larger-scale set piece around which each episode is structured. In the first, this main subject is the changing of his name by deed poll to Hugo Boss in order to draw the ire of the clothing company and highlight its heavyhanded approach to protecting its intellectual property. Hugo Boss (the company, not the artist formerly known as Joe Lycett) recently sent a cease and desist letter to a tiny Welsh company called Boss Brewing \u2013 so we are literally talking small beer \u2013 over the use of the word \u201cBoss\u201d in its branding. After spending \u00a310,000 on legal fees, the little guys had to give up the fight and spend another \u00a315,000 or so renaming products that anyone with a modicum of sense instead of a barrelful of corporate malevolence could see are no threat whatsoever to the fashion conglomerate. The programme hammered home the unfairness by recapping all the pre-show media coverage the pointed prank had garnered, and holding a launch party for the wrist support bandage newly produced by Hugo Boss (this time indeed the artist formerly known as Joe Lycett) outside the other\u2019s flagship London store. If it didn\u2019t result in a restoration of the Boss Brewing fortunes, it at least brought them some good publicity and made sure the original Hugo Boss name is mud. Elsewhere, Katherine Ryan lent her deadpan support to the righting of more minor wrongs, including the growing phenomenon of agencies that have sprung up to offer would-be online media influencers the chance \u2013 for a price \u2013 to get invited to all the right parties, connect with brands and set themselves on the path to a lucrative career. You might roll your eyes because, bleurgh, influencers, but it\u2019s a predation against good faith and vulnerable people, and the perpetrators as deserving of censure as any others. The more lighthearted sections result in a cake-deprived woman having her rations restored by Val from The Great British Bake Off, and Lycett painting Marmite \u201cpoo\u201d stains on knickers to test Boohoo\u2019s (apparently woeful) returns and resale policy. We are short on justice and charm in this odd and difficult time. It\u2019s nice to have a little of both restored."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
