It was part naughty schoolboy, part Tommy Cooper as, while a team-mate kicked a penalty into touch, Jackson hid a spare ball behind his back, sprinted downfield to tap the second part of the penalty quickly, and cruised over without a Leeds defender laying a hand on him. The Rhinos were as stunned as the 12,000 crowd, and the officials were equally confused as the referee Russell Smith consulted his touch judge, then handed the decision on to the video referee - who did not spot Jackson's subterfuge, and awarded the try. Fortunately it made no difference to the result, coming in the 76th minute with Leeds out of sight at 36-10. But that did not stop their coach Daryl Powell making an angry protest to the fourth official on the touchline, and both the touch judge and the video referee could be in hot water when the Rugby Football League's technical director investigates the incident tomorrow - because they failed to spot that two balls were in play. Jackson could also face a charge of ungentlemanly conduct, although that would be a little heavy-handed. The 33-year-old has always played with a smile on his face, appropriately given his longstanding love of cartoons - and Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck would have been proud of his latest trick. There wasn't much else for the Airlie Birds to smile about on Friday, as a disappointing season came to a fitting end. The gamble of playing their Australian captain Jason Smith with a dislocated elbow did not pay off, as even the formidably tough Queenslander was unable to carry on after half-time, and their director of rugby Shaun McRae hinted at a major shake-up of his squad afterwards. He has already signed Richie Barnett, the former New Zealand captain who has spent the last two years with London, and another classy outside back in the Cronulla centre Colin Best, which should give Hull much-needed strike power for their move to the new Kingston Communications Stadium they will share with Hull City from next season - although first they will say an official farewell to the Boulevard with the first game of the autumn's Kiwi tour on 22 October, the Tuesday after the grand final. Leeds are now only two more wins from a first Old Trafford appearance since 1998, and although St Helens and Bradford - who meet next Saturday in the qualifying semi-final - must remain the favourites, the Rhinos should not be entirely ruled out. Their Great Britain pair of Kevin Sinfield and Keith Senior were outstanding on Friday, with Sinfield putting his name alongside those of Andy Farrell and Paul Sculthorpe in the battle to play loose-forward for the Lions against New Zealand this autumn, and Senior scoring a typically powerful hat-trick. But it was the way the Rhinos defended which offered the most encouragement. Leeds had hinted at a new steeliness in their first serious match of the season, a shock Challenge Cup win at Bradford way back in February, only for the old defensive shortcomings to re-emerge - with their total of 700 points conceded in the 28 matches of the regular season easily the worst of the top six. On Friday they tackled magnificently, notably in the first 12 minutes as Hull laid siege to their line but could not cross it, with Sinfield then launching a stunning counter-attack with a quick tap, a couple of dummies and a pass to send Senior between the posts. Although they ended up conceding 22 points, that was grossly misleading: each of Hull's three tries came in the last 20 minutes when the match was already over; and one of them, of course, needed an extra ball. The former Leeds forward Adrian Morley will join a select band of Poms to play in the Australian grand final next Sunday, after the Sydney Roosters, who Morley joined 18 months ago, beat Brisbane Broncos 16-12 yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
