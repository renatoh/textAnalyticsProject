It means hotel on the hill, and there's no shortage of those on this relatively quiet (well, it's early in the season) north-west coast of the island. We're a decent distance from the fleshpots of Magaluf and anticipating a week of good food, (shortish) walks and horizontal reading. The scents of lemon and orange groves are intoxicating; our family-run pension is just a few minutes from the little church where the poet Robert Graves, a long-term resident of the island for several decades until his death in 1985, is buried. I guess the toffs are being sporty at Richard Branson's upmarket La Residencia Hotel across the road? But we've got the atmosphere and views at a fraction of the price (though not the cosseting, alas, we can view the white-coated minions attending to every whim from our balcony). Here there are just eight tastefully simple rooms (the four to the rear have terraces). Ochre walls, terracotta tiles, the ubiquitous green shutters and lovingly tended brass detail on polished dark wood. The en-suite shower rooms are tiny: don't even try to swing a mouse. There's a little bar, inside and outside eating areas and a small pool with a sun terrace. Beyond this we can see olive groves and the Serra de Tramuntana mountains and hear goat bells tinkling from the steep terraces opposite. Sounds perfect. What's the catch? Only minor irritants. Narrow beds if used as twins, a wall-mounted TV so high you need to lie down to view, a jammed shutter and inadequate shower curtain. And when you feel like a little trip? Hop on the bus (only \u20ac1/65p) to the Carthusian monastery at Valldemossa (where they are obsessed by writer George Sand and her lover Frederick Chopin who dallied there for a winter in 1838-39) and great people-watching cafes. Or go in theopposite direction to Soller and an uphill stroll to the two most beautiful villages on the island (so it is said), Biniaraix and Fornalutx. So were there enough places to stoke up? That really is all there is to do in Deia in the evening. Favourites were Sebastian, Sa Vinya and Jaume, all with \u00e0 la carte menus (about \u00a325). Treble that if you cannot resist Branson's El Olivo at the Residencia. Avoid the high season, and you'll have problems tearing yourself away to Palma for the return flight. \u00b7 S'Hotel d'Es Puig, Es Puig 4, 07179 Deia, Mallorca. Rooms \u00a355-\u00a398 including buffet breakfast. (00 34 971 63 94 09)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
