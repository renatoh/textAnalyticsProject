In a corner of the small town\u2019s railway museum, tucked away in storage and forgotten, was the old Bishop Auckland railway union banner, believed to date back to 1915. A classic of its genre, this piece of early labour movement iconography depicts smartly uniformed rail workers gazing towards a utopian future. Below there is a version of the final paragraph of the Communist Manifesto: \u201cWorkers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win.\u201d O\u2019Neill, 44, is from Bishop Auckland. Over the years he has been involved in numerous community projects, most recently raising funds for a memorial to Cpl Lee Brownson, a local boy who was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. Through O\u2019Neill\u2019s efforts, the railwaymen\u2019s banner is now proudly on display at the Four Clocks Centre in Bishop Auckland, alongside a small exhibition telling the story of the world\u2019s first steam locomotive railway line, which passed through the area. For a lifelong Labour voter, this was an act of loving commemoration. But in less than two weeks time, O\u2019Neill will vote Conservative in the general election. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Labour member and my family has always voted Labour,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the party around here has turned nasty in my opinion, since the Brexit referendum. I voted to leave, but leave voters are being called racist and far right, which is not how it is. We have a local Labour MP in Helen Goodman who should be standing up for democracy. It shouldn\u2019t matter that she voted remain.\u201d The significance of what would amount to a political revolution in the town everyone calls Bishop is not lost on O\u2019Neill: \u201cTen years ago, a Conservative MP wouldn\u2019t get the time of day on the doorstep around here. This place is steeped in memories of the Thatcher era and the mines and the steelworks. But I\u2019m not alone in turning against Labour.\u201d Last week, the most comprehensive poll of the election campaign so far predicted that Goodman\u2019s tiny majority of 502 will be overturned on 12 December, and that 25 year-old Dehenna Davison will become the first Tory to represent the area. Bishop Auckland voted 61% in favour of leave and Davison\u2019s Twitter hashtag incorporates the Boris Johnson mantra: \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Though a Brexit party candidate is standing, the seat is acknowledged to be a two-horse race. In a region which feels its collective voice and concerns have been ignored since the mines closed and other industries went the same way, Labour leave voters saw Brexit as carrying the possibility of social renewal. The failure of the party to fully endorse the referendum result is seen by former supporters like O\u2019Neill as both dishonourable and a sign that the party has moved away from its working-class roots. Goodman\u2019s much-diminished majority \u2013 in 2005, it was over 10,000 - also suggests Labour is paying the price of long-term local incumbency in an era of deepening disillusionment across the region. The mining town of Spennymoor and the surrounding pit villages sit within a constituency that was part of one of the richest, most culturally vibrant coalfields in Europe. Twenty-five years after the last pit closed, there is a palpable longing to restore a lost sense of purpose and cohesion; and an anger at the way that the infrastructure of communal life has been allowed to corrode and decay. Bernadette Rush in her bridal shop: \u2018A lot of places in the high street are owned by absent landlords and they are just left to rot.\u2019 Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer In Bishop Auckland, the closure of the local A&amp;E has become a major election issue. Davison is promising to re-open it. Sarah Bryson, a mental health nurse who commutes to work in Durham, is sceptical. \u201cBrilliant, but how?\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be great to have a fully functioning hospital on every doorstep, but that\u2019s just not where we are at.\u201d Nevertheless, Bryson sympathises with those who campaigned against the closure. \u201cThis town and surrounding areas have lost their connection to a lot of things; the idea of the closure of a hospital seems to sum that up in people\u2019s minds. It gives a sense that somehow this area isn\u2019t worthy.\u201d The high street, one of Britain\u2019s longest, has been in steep decline for a while. This month, Bernadette Rush will vacate No 136, where she has run Image, a bridal shop, for eight years. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge dip in sales,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are either buying on-line or from out-of-town suppliers who are manufacturing dresses offshore far cheaper than I can buy them for.\u201d For the past few years, Rush, a skilled seamstress, has made her living from making alterations to dresses bought elsewhere. She now plans to work from home, freeing herself from the overheads. Twenty per cent of town centre business units are vacant, including the Victorian co-op building which, until 2017, housed Beales department store. The site has been earmarked for either a hotel or apartments, but for now it sits like an open wound in the centre of Bishop Auckland. \u201cA lot of places in the high street are owned by absent landlords and they are just left to rot,\u201d says Rush. \u201cThey just look a mess. It\u2019s very unsightly.\u201d Like many other residents, Rush hopes a singular turn of events may yet turn the town\u2019s fortunes around. Last month, Auckland Castle, the medieval home of the prince bishops of Durham, was opened to the public. Restored, its 18th-century Long Dining Room displays work by the 17th-century artist Francisco de Zubar\u00e1n, sometimes known as the \u201cSpanish Caravaggio\u201d. Elsewhere, visitors can see Nicolas Poussin\u2019s The Triumph of Pan, which is on loan from the National Gallery. The slightly surreal Auckland Project\u2019 is the \u00a3150m brainchild of Jonathan Ruffer, a City investor from Stokesley, near Middlesbrough. Ruffer bought the Zubar\u00e1ns from the Church Commissioners, which was intending to sell them off. As well as restoring the castle he is regenerating the adjacent marketplace, where a miners\u2019 art gallery and a 29-metre viewing tower were opened last year. A Spanish art gallery, in homage to Zubar\u00e1n, is planned and the market square\u2019s pubs have been bought and closed, before conversion into hotels and restaurants. Ruffer has also funded the annual Kynren, an outdoor pageant chronicling 2,000 years of English history. Below left: Beales department store closed in 2017.

But in the Fifteas Vintage Tearoom, in the market square, John Phelan is happy to sing Ruffer\u2019s praises. Phelan is a local historian who lives in the nearby village of Howden-le-Wear, which is in the neighbouring constituency of North West Durham. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Phelan says. \u201cHe\u2019s turning Bishop Auckland into a place of culture. One to rival Durham even. History might be the new thing to bring some hope and a feeling of community back to Bishop.\u201d A sense of renewal is desperately required, Phelan adds. \u201cYou\u2019d like to think as life went on things would get better, but they\u2019ve not.\u201d An inveterate romantic, this year Phelan is sending out Christmas cards which carry a photograph of the FA Amateur Cup final in 1954, when \u2018Bishop\u2019 played local rivals, Crook Town, in front of a Wembley crowd of 100,000. His father took him, aged four, to the match on a train that went directly from Crook to London. But the nostalgia comes with a sharp edge. Echoing a theme that comes up continually in the area, a lack of public transport, Phelan says: \u201cA lack of funding from central government has knocked County Durham back generally. The buses have been cut and you barely get any after 6pm. That impacts on people\u2019s lives. There are villages that are practically cut off in the evening now, for people who don\u2019t drive. \u201cThe cuts to street-lighting have meant that rural areas are pitch black at night. I know a woman who is frightened to walk her dogs because it gets so dark. Austerity has chipped away at the quality of life of communities.\u201d Phelan will vote Labour but is not holding out too much hope. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if the Conservatives tip it their way this time. The Labour vote isn\u2019t as loyal as it once was and some people are not so keen on Helen Goodman. \u201cI tell people who are thinking of voting Conservative, \u2018You\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot. Look at the cuts. The Conservative governments haven\u2019t done anything for this area.\u2019 But the Brexit issue has been very bad. If I\u2019d have voted for Brexit I\u2019d be angry with Labour. They\u2019ve dillied and dallied on it. It\u2019s been weak. A Labour leader should have said: \u2018People have voted to leave and that\u2019s it whether you like it or not.\u201d Ryan Lamb (23). Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer Whether that would have won the vote of Ryan Lamb, a 23-year-old labourer from Spennymoor, is doubtful. Lamb voted leave in 2016 and Tory in the general election a year later. He intends to do so again this time round, though he has no faith in the pledges being made on either side of the political spectrum. \u201cThey all talk a load of shite,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Boris Johnson is going to put my wages up. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to put more money into the NHS. But [Jeremy] Corbyn\u2019s crap. Someone sent me a Piers Morgan interview on Facebook. He showed Corbyn up. In the end, we were meant to leave on Halloween and we didn\u2019t. It comes down to that.\u201d Andrew Smith is an 80-year-old former NUM activist who worked at the Mainsforth and Ferryhill pits. He now volunteers at Spennymoor\u2019s mining museum, sometimes assisted byErnie Foster, 81, who was also active in the union. The small museum is an affecting cornucopia of mining memorabilia: there are banners of course, but also detonators, cables and a trophy awarded at the Spennymoor gala pit pony competition in 1956. A detail from a panel in Spennymoor town hall. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer Smith views the forthcoming election, and the fraying of loyalty to Labour, with sadness and trepidation. \u201cIt makes you angry,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you frustrated that people who have gone through the times that you went through, are thinking like this. It\u2019s not just the young. It takes a lot to get through to people; to explain what the real problems are. The media don\u2019t help with their bias; people say they don\u2019t like Corbyn. But when you ask them they don\u2019t really know why.\u201d A December election is not ideal for octogenarian activists: \u201cWe\u2019d like to get out leafleting for Labour,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting on now.\u201d Foster chips in: \u201cThe main thing is that we can\u2019t have that lot in round here \u2013 the Tories. That can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
