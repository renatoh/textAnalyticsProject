Waldorf plays with a smile on his face and, unlike many of his contemporaries, does not live and die by his performance over 18 holes - even when it is a four-under-par 67 at Muirfield. Some might get carried away by such a score, but not Waldorf who, though not an eccentric, must rate as one of the more bizarre golfers on the professional circuit. He uses balls with scribbled notes of good luck from his family and they are also painted to remind him of his favourite food. This week it is his preferred ice creams, with yesterday's being key lime pie; today it may well be chocolate. And while others dream of winning majors, he says he dreams of how long his 2,000-bottle wine collection will last. A professional for 17 years, he stopped worrying long ago about his disappointing title return - only four - and says he judges himself by a different set of standards. \"If I had to rate my career by how many wins I have I probably would be a pretty unhappy guy, but I don't look at it that way,\" he said after his flying start. \"I go out there and enjoy playing the game and if I can keep my game going I'll be happy no matter where I finish. You have to be able to separate things and evaluate your game and not have it affect your life, not have it that you're a bad person because you play bad.\" Unlike his bright blue-and-white attire, his play was ultra-conservative. He opened with eight consecutive pars, then picked up shots at 9, 12, 14 and 18 to find himself the sole leader with most of the field back in the clubhouse. But true to his relaxed approach, the 39-year-old took it all in his stride. \"I can't worry about doing well in majors,\" he said. \"It's just great even to get in them. I wasn't even in it [the Open] a week ago and only made it with a good finish in the Western Open.\" Waldorf has a personality to match and an approach to his career that some of the perfection-seekers on tour might have a hard time understanding. His laid-back philosophy has earned him over $6m - and enabled him to build up his wine collection, with Italian reds and Austrian whites his current favourites. \"You're supposed to fantasise about good rounds. I fantasise about how long my wine will last. The most expensive is one my dad gave me, a '75 La Mission Haut Brion, probably $4-500. Unless, that is, you get it at Greywalls [the hotel adjoining the course] and then it's an $800 bottle! \"They don't have it there - I looked. But there was a '76 which was reasonably priced.\" And how about his Hawaiian shirt, just one of a collection he owns which are sure to light up Muirfield. They are his trademark and once had him compared to a pizza delivery man. \"I like to think that even when I'm in Scotland my brain can be in Hawaii,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
