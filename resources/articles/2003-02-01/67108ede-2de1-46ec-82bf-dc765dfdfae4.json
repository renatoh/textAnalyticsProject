So can you offset this by lower maintenance costs? The obvious advantages include a 10-year guarantee that comes with most new property, through the National House Building Council or a firm called Zurich, to cover repairs. It is also easier to get a mortgage - under 0.1 per cent of applications for new homes are rejected by lenders because of problems with the property, compared with more than 1.5 per cent involving older homes. Disadvantages include familiar problems such as nearby houses and roads still being built when you move in, and the fact that if you sell within two or three years you are unlikely to get the price that you paid, because of that 15 per cent 'new homes premium'. But sharp-witted househunters buying 'off plan' - before the house is built - can get bargains. Many builders offer deals such as free carpets and kitchen white goods, or will pay stamp duty and moving costs. Surveys show that buyers aged 35 and above, who used to favour period properties, are becoming keener to purchase new ones. 'Older buyers lead more active lives than before and have more disposable income. They don't want to finish work on Friday and have repairs to do over the weekend. Likewise, retired buyers hanker after low-maintenance properties' says Dominic Grace, head of new homes at estate agent FPDSavills. Even buyers of \u00a3800,000-plus properties consider new homes, especially since recently-relaxed planning rules mean large country houses are again being built again after a gap of 20 years. Developers in London have created a hybrid called 'refurbished established homes', offering original features but ultra-modern fittings. These properties have extremely high specifications - expect under-floor heating, plasma TVs and remote-control security, lighting and music systems. DTZ claims these can fetch 30 per cent more than comparable traditional properties in prime areas. Top tips If you don't buy 'off plan', go to the other extreme and find a development that's very nearly all sold. Builders often slash prices on the final properties because getting rid of them means they can stop paying insurance and security charges.
