While sporting officials said they would appeal against a ban that would let \u2018clean\u2019 athletes compete under a neutral flag at the Tokyo Olympics next year, the heads of several sporting federations and politicians denounced the Wada decision as \u201cpoliticised\u201d. They were led by Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, who, while admitting \u201csignificant doping problems still exist\u201d in Russia\u2019s sporting community, labelled Wada\u2019s decision as part of \u201cchronic anti-Russian hysteria\u201d that affected athletes who \u201chad already been punished\u201d. Svetlana Zhurova, a retired Olympic speedskater and a current member of Russia\u2019s parliament, told Russian television the decision \u201churt me personally as an athlete \u2026 why lay collective responsibility [for the doping scandal] on a 15-year-old girl? On our fantastic figure skaters, synchronised swimmers or athletes in sports where nobody has even heard about a doping scandal?\u201d In an interview on state-run television, Vladimir Drachev, the head of the Russian Biathlon Union, called the decision \u201cextremely wrong and biased. The decision made today is a political one rather than one related to sports,\u201d Drachev said, adding that blocking young athletes from representing Russia is \u201cwrong\u201d. \u201cSports should stay separate from politics, and strong athletes should compete and represent their country, they should not perform under a neutral flag.\u201d And in an open letter published before the Wada decision Alisher Usmanov, the billionaire former head of Russia\u2019s fencing federation, who is now president of the International Fencing Federation, said the fight against doping risked being turned into \u201clynching\u201d. But the decision also prompted some athletes to speak out against Russian sporting officials who, they believed, had not done enough to reform Russian sport despite repeated warnings. \u201cI didn\u2019t doubt that it could end up like this,\u201d said Mariya Lasitskene, a world champion high jumper who has been outspoken on doping issues. She missed the 2016 Olympics because of sanctions imposed on Russia\u2019s track-and-field team. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe the stories about how everything was going to be OK. What\u2019s happened today is a shame.\u201d But In an online post, she said she would continue to try to compete and criticised Russian sporting officials for defending athletes \u201cin words only,\u201d leaving athletes \u201calone in this fight.\u201d Alexander Tikhonov, a retired Olympic biathlon skier and former federation head, said: \u201cWe got what we deserved, in remarks reported by the website Sport24.ru. \u201cI said immediately that I\u2019m on the side of Wada.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
