I am incredibly proud of the players for what they have achieved and from now it is all about doing well in Japan.\u201d Wales rode an emotional tidal wave here to wash away Ireland. \u201cWe were going for the slam while Ireland knew that, realistically, they were playing for second,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cThat had a significant impact and it was a great performance by the players. We expected the roof to be open and from the start of the week we tailored our gameplan to wet conditions. \u201cIn a year\u2019s time I will be sitting somewhere watching the Six Nations. I will miss it and hope this group of players can continue to put respect into the jersey as has been the case for the last 12 years. All supporters ask is that players try hard and that\u2019s what makes this group so difficult to beat.\u201d The Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, said the best was still to come. \u201cAt times we have been unconvincing so we like to think there is still potential in us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are well aware we have put a target on our backs before the World Cup. \u201cWe have shown that anything can happen when you work hard. Warren is the man at the top and he has been unwavering when we have been under pressure. I am sure we will miss Warren when he is gone, but that is not for a few months yet.\u201d Wales\u2019s campaign was disrupted by a public dispute over the future of the country\u2019s four regions. \u201cIt has not all been smooth sailing,\u201d said the outside-half Gareth Anscombe, the man of the match who scored 20 points and created his side\u2019s try. \u201cWe have developed a habit of winning and as a group we work incredibly hard for each other.\u201d It was the final match in the Six Nations for the Ireland captain, Rory Best. \u201cWe could not get a foothold after Wales\u2019s cracking start,\u201d said the hooker. \u201cThey put us under a lot of pressure: it can do strange things to you and we struggled to respond. We have to address why we lost, dust ourselves off and finish the year strongly. We will talk about the aftermath later but credit to Wales, deserved grand slam winners.\u201d Ireland struggled to play catch-up in the rain, a legacy of their decision to keep the roof open. \u201cPerhaps that was a mistake,\u201d said their head coach, Joe Schmidt. \u201cIt was about getting ahead early and they did that. Going for a grand slam gives you an extra 5% and they were desperately keen to achieve it, as we were at Twickenham last year. \u201cWe need to grow a bit from this before the World Cup, reflect and rebuild, but you have to take your hat off to Wales and to Gats \u2013 12 years in charge of an international side is an incredible achievement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
