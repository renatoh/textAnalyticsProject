The company has flagged test flights will begin next year, with commercial operations to start in 2023. Passengers will travel in \u201celectric vertical take-off\u201d contraptions. The service will operate using the Uber app, allowing passengers to travel across a network of landing pads called \u201cSkyports\u201d. Uber spokesman Eric Allison said the concept had the potential to reduce traffic congestion which costs the Australian economy an estimated $16.5bn a year. \u201cThe 19km journey from the CBD to Melbourne airport can take anywhere from 25 minutes to around an hour by car in peak hour, but with Uber Air this will take around 10 minutes,\u201d Allison said. Dallas and Los Angeles in the US will also be pilot cities. Melbourne beat cities in Brazil, France, India and Japan. The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the announcement was testament to Melbourne\u2019s record of innovation. \u201cVictorians have a can-do attitude and we hope Uber Air will give us the altitude to match it,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday. Pallas said there had been no request from Uber for financing. He said he wanted to put his hand up as the first customer. \u201cI\u2019m Uber excited,\u201d he joked. RMIT University aerospace engineer expert Matthew Marino said the concept would potentially be safer than driverless cars. \u201cWhile a driverless car would be faced with obstacles on the road like pedestrians on their mobile phones or other vehicles like trams and buses, aerial autonomous vehicles don\u2019t have these obstructions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to prove to people that this technology can be as safe as helicopters, which regularly fly in our cities. More research and development are needed in this area.\u201d Centre for Urban Research expert Chris De Gruyter was sceptical about whether Uber Air can can solve transport problems. \u201cThese vehicles are very low capacity \u2013 similar to what a car could carry \u2013 while there are also questions about if these vehicles will create visual clutter in the sky and how environmentally friendly they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother risk is empty running, where there are no passengers, but the vehicle has to travel to pick people up from another location.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
