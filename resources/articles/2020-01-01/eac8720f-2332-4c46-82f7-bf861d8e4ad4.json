Perez said she called Sciorra on a chilly night in 1993. Perez was in a good mood, saying, \u201cGirl, what\u2019s up? Wanna hang out?\u201d hoping Sciorra was interested in going out that night. Instead, Sciorra told Perez in a serious, whispered voice: \u201cI think something happened to me.\u201d Perez pressed Sciorra further, and Sciorra quietly said: \u201cI think I was raped.\u201d \u201cIt was so strange because she whispered it,\u201d Perez said, before whispering into the microphone in demonstration. Though Sciorra is not a complainant in Weinstein\u2019s criminal case now playing out in a courtroom in Manhattan, where two other women with more recent cases are the ones formally attached to the charges of rape and sexual assault against the fallen movie mogul , she was called in as a key witness to his alleged pattern of predatory behavior. On Thursday, Sciorra took the witness stand and gave harrowing testimony on Weinstein\u2019s alleged rape of her in the winter of 1993-94 at her apartment in Manhattan. She re-enacted Weinstein pinning her down on to her bed. \u201cHe got on top of me and he raped me,\u201d she said. She said Weinstein then forcibly performed oral sex on her after, telling her: \u201cThis is for you.\u201d Recalling the subsequent phone call with Sciorra, Perez recalled on Friday she asked Sciorra if she knew who assaulted her, and encouraged her to call the police. She recalled Sciorra saying, \u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t\u201d before hurriedly saying she had to go. Perez said she tried to call Sciorra multiple times that night but Sciorra never picked up the phone. A few days later, when Perez was able to reach Sciorra, she told Perez she was fine and that she did not want to talk about it any further. Several months later, Perez said she got a phone call from Sciorra, who was in London, who eventually said it was Weinstein who assaulted her. During her testimony on Thursday, Sciorra told the jury Weinstein showed up at her hotel room in the middle of the night. Perez recalled Sciorra calling her up and telling her that Weinstein was \u201charassing her and that she was scared that he was going to get her again\u201d, Perez said. \u201cThen I said, \u2018He\u2019s the one that raped you\u2019,\u201d Perez recalled. Once Perez knew the identity of Weinstein, Sciorra gave her more details of the incident. \u201cShe was crying and she swore me to never tell anybody,\u201d Perez said. Perez said when she encouraged Sciorra to call the police, Sciorra said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to destroy my career.\u201d In cross-examination, Weinstein\u2019s defense team pressed Perez on why she did not take more urgent action when she learned that her friend was assaulted. \u201cI was in a panic, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was scared, I was scared for her,\u201d Perez said, breathlessly speaking to the jury. \u201cI was in a panic, I kept calling her repeatedly, crying, begging her to pick up the phone.\u201d Weinstein, 67, has denied all the charges. Earlier in the day, a forensic psychiatrist testified as an expert witness, dispelling common \u201crape myths\u201d and explaining common behavior of sexual assault victims to the trial\u2019s jury. As a powerpoint presentation titled \u201crape myths\u201d was pulled up in front of the jury, Barbara Ziv, a psychiatrist based in Philadelphia walked the jury through six common myths she said people have about rape victims. Ziv was invited to testify by the trial\u2019s prosecution and said she was not informed of the case\u2019s facts before her testimony. She has testified in more than 200 cases, including in the trial of Bill Cosby in 2018. \u201cOne of the reasons why I\u2019m allowed to testify in this court \u2026 about sexual trauma and victim behavior is because people come to assess sexual assault with preconceived notions that are usually wrong,\u201d Ziv told the jury. The belief that rape occurs most commonly between strangers is false, Ziv said, adding that 85% of all sex assault cases are perpetuated by someone who knows the victim. People also wrongly assume sexual assault victims resist their assailants. \u201cThis idea that women respond to sexual assault verbally, by screaming, yelling, hitting, punching, biting \u2013 although that happens, it\u2019s rare,\u201d Ziv said. Another myth, she said, contradicts Weinstein\u2019s argument that the sexual relationship he had with the women represented in the trial was consensual because they maintained contact with him after the alleged assaults. Earlier this week, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers showed the jury a series of emails and texts from the women that suggested they continued to have warm relations with him. One message showed a woman reminiscing with Weinstein about earlier encounters and asking him if he could meet her in London. \u201cIt is common \u2013 it is, in fact, the norm \u2013 to have contact with [the assailant],\u201d Ziv told the jury. \u201cThat contact can range from text messages to email exchanges, to continuing to have a relationship with them or developing a relationship with them.\u201d Ziv explained the psychological complexity of sexual assault \u2013 which, Ziv noted, is the most unreported crime \u2013 often stems from a victim\u2019s inability to process trauma and a tendency to blame themselves for the assault. She noted that for many victims hiding the assault is preferred to the perceived consequences of reporting. \u201cMost individuals think: \u2018I can put it behind me, I can put it in a box. I don\u2019t want it to get worse,\u2019\u201d Ziv said. But, ultimately, she said: \u201cThey can\u2019t.\u201d The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
