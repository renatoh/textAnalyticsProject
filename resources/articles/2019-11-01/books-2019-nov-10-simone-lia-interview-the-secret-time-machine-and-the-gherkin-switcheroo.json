I didn\u2019t know why.\u201d As I walk into her house in south London, I notice a huge painting in her hall with a caption in shaky capitals: \u201cWORM HARMONY\u201d. The worms look like demob-happy frankfurters. They have floaty bodies, dazed smiles. She knew enough, she goes on, to know she should pay attention to this obsession. And, with a laugh, she explains she realised how much she admired the character of the worm: \u201cThey\u2019re very humble, live in the ground, do good work, get on with it.\u201d These qualities, she says, \u201cI\u2019d like for myself.\u201d If this sounds like a Christian aspiration, it will not surprise Lia\u2019s many fans. In 2011, she beguiled readers with the book that made her name: Please God, Find Me a Husband! The belief in God was no joke. But the book was very funny. In one irresistible sequence, Lia, whose boyfriend had just ended their relationship by email, walks disconsolately across Leicester Square. She hears the lyrics of INXS\u2019s Need You Tonight playing from a bar and believes God is communicating with her. Before long, in her mind\u2019s eye, she is dancing friskily with God \u2013 a bearded, bespectacled bloke in a pale blue, calf-length dress. Her story leads her to a religious order in Wales (\u201cI\u2019m so not going to find a husband hanging out with nuns\u201d) and to Australia, where she meets a handsome horseman who, in the way of handsome horsemen, disappears over the horizon. It is eight years since that book was published (it has five worms on one of its opening pages). As we sit down in Lia\u2019s front room, I ask how long it took God to get his act together. \u201cTen years,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d trick God by doing a book. I felt sure God would give me a happy ending and I\u2019d definitely get a husband. But it doesn\u2019t really work like that. I finished the book and there was no one. I was 33. I didn\u2019t meet my husband until I was 41. We married two years later.\u201d I am looking at her as she speaks, her bright, smiling face always on the edge of wincing at herself. I am thinking how nice it would be to have a black-and-white drawing of her because her clothes would be such fun to colour in: scarlet T-bar shoes, a mustard-yellow cardy, a blue-and-white skirt. The man we\u2019re talking about, Timothy, a graphic designer, is the son of an inspirational Australian artist friend of hers. When his mother came to London to visit her son, they both called in on Lia. One of Lia\u2019s friends had told her it was pointless to wait for a man to come knocking at her door. \u201cBut Tim literally did knock on my door. He was really handsome and we had so much in common \u2013 it was amazing.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe even had a little bit of matching eczema on our foreheads.\u201d This, clearly, was a mark of God, I say. She shrieks with laughter (I can imagine her drawing the matching eczema \u2013 it would be the sort of zanily miniaturist detail she relishes). \u201cI now think God meant me to wait in order to appreciate what happened next.\u201d She was nearly 44 when their daughter, Anj\u00e8s, was born. Anj\u00e8s is a \u201creally friendly\u201d two-year-old, she says, adding: \u201cWhere does that come from? I\u2019m not like that, I\u2019m really withdrawn and a bit weird.\u201d Nonsense, I say. Not only is Lia herself \u201creally friendly\u201d but her focus, in her work, is on the mystery of friendship \u2013 human, animal, divine. Her latest children\u2019s book could even be, she suggests, about marriage. The Secret Time Machine and the Gherkin Switcheroo describes the challenge of living with an old bird who does the crossword puzzle and does not want to go out, and a worm who dreams of wriggling back underground. Having said that, the worm overturns Lia\u2019s definition of wormdom by mainly living above ground and by not being humble at all. He swings between feeling he is worthless and believing himself a genius. Like most of us, he is ordinary. \u201cI relate to the worm much more than the bird,\u201d she laughs. Lia\u2019s parents came from Malta \u2013 her father was an electronics engineer, her mother a housewife. She grew up in a housing settlement in Haverhill, Suffolk \u2013 an alienating, ill-conceived place with few amenities. With her sleek black hair, she was often jeered at, called a \u201cPaki\u201d. She did an art foundation year in Ipswich, studied illustration in Brighton and, while doing an MA at the Royal College of Art, met Tom Gauld, who \u201cgot me into comics\u201d, and with whom she collaborated (on Both). I am so diverted by her, I forget to ask where God fits in nowadays and pursue the subject by email. She replies in full. She explains she needs to \u201ccome out\u201d as a Catholic because \u201cour culture is not set up for a relationship that takes place in silence and solitude\u201d. In the interests of honesty, she feels she should not leave out \u201cthe dark bit\u201d of her life. Raised a Catholic, she lapsed in her teens: \u201cPutting things mildly, there was a lot of fighting at home. I felt very alone and felt even Jesus was not listening to my prayers \u2013 it felt like he did not care. That is when I stopped praying, became interested in art. Drawing and painting was an escape. I could enter another world and forget about feeling lonely or afraid.\u201d Throughout her 20s, she was \u201csearching to find myself or to find something I guess. I wasn\u2019t ever quite sure of my place in the world. That might be how Fluffy came about.\u201d Fluffy (2007) was a graphic novel about the relationship between a rabbit and the floundering human being he thinks of as his dad. It looks like a children\u2019s book but isn\u2019t. Fluffy keeps asking his \u201cdad\u201d what Miss Owers (Fluffy\u2019s nursery teacher) is doing spending the night with him, and the book includes irresistibly wacky ideas such as the moment when a dust particle takes over as narrator. It was while researching for Fluffy in Sicily (the rabbit goes on hols there) that Lia rediscovered God. A randomly encountered Mormon asked her whether she still prayed. She went into a baroque church but all she could think of was to ask God for a better hotel room (she feared she had been staying in a brothel). \u201cDespite my rubbishy prayer, I felt something out of the world in that moment. It\u2019s very hard to explain but it was as if my heart opened up and rain was falling on me and the rain was love. I lifted my head and let it drench my being. In my mind\u2019s eye, I could see a golden light falling from above. It sounds loopy if I say it out loud. But from that moment, something shifted inside of me.\u201d She left the church feeling full of joy and, 10 minutes later, found a superior hotel room. \u201cFunnily enough, there was a picture of the sacred heart of Jesus in that room, the same picture I\u2019d poured my heart out to as a child with my woes and worries.\u201d Lia\u2019s gift has always been for identifying the comedy in her woes and worries. Even during a difficult labour, she says that she managed to have a laugh. And often, when writing, she imagines she is \u201ctalking to my sister to make her laugh\u201d \u2013 which might explain the warmth of her work, the way she makes you feel she is your friend. I tell her I particularly loved a recent column in the Observer\u2019s New Review entitled \u201cHow to get a winter body fast!\u201d, sending up potentially harmful articles that tell women who to be/what to eat. \u201cThat week I\u2019d eaten a whole packet of custard creams in one sitting,\u201d she exclaims. Trying to sum up her sense of humour, she continues: \u201cI don\u2019t like making jokes about other people. But if somebody laughs at the jokes I make laughing at myself, I really like them.\u201d Every day, she asks herself: \u201cWhat have I accomplished?\u201d Her aim is to make sure that, even if she has achieved nothing else, she has had a \u201cgood old belly laugh\u201d. \u2022 The Secret Time Machine and the Gherkin Switcheroo by Simone Lia is published by Walker Books (\u00a39.99).
