Officer Mohamed Noor turned himself in on Tuesday after a warrant was issued for his arrest in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. Damond was shot on 15 July, minutes after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault in the alley behind her home. The shooting led to international condemnation, widespread street protests and the firing of the police chief. The local prosecutor, the Hennepin county attorney Mike Freeman, laid out the case against the officer in a criminal complaint and a Tuesday afternoon media conference. \u201cTo lose a family member to violence is always wrenching and painful. But to lose it when she was acting as a concerned and caring citizen, and at the hands of the person she called for help, is inexplicable,\u201d Freeman said. He began by laying out the facts of the acts already confirmed by authorities, but then, with charges already filed, he proceeded to go into much greater detail about what investigators believe happen on the night Damond died. According to investigators, after calling authorities to report what she thought was a sexual assault happening outside her home, Damond approached the back of the Ford Explorer in which Noor was the passenger and his partner, officer Matthew Harrity, was the driver. While Noor has invoked his constitutional right to not speak with investigators, Harrity did talk to them and appeared before the grand jury assembled to consider the case. Freeman said that according to Harrity, Noor had radioed to dispatch a signal meaning that their investigation was complete when Harrity described hearing a \u201ca voice, and a thump somewhere behind him on the squad car and caught a glimpse of a person\u2019s head and shoulders outside his driver-side window\u201d \u2014 an account that supports previous reports indicating that investigators believe Damond tapped or hit the back of the police SUV to get the officers\u2019 attention before approaching the driver\u2019s window. Then, according to Freeman, Harrity said he \u201cheard a sound he described like a light bulb dropping on the floor\u201d and saw a flash and Noor\u2019s right arm extended across him towards the open window. Harrity then looked out the window and saw Damond with her hands over a wound on her left side, Freeman said. Before getting out of the car, Harrity reporting hearing what would appear to be Damond\u2019s last words: \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m dead.\u201d Freeman explained that his task at trial would be to prove that, even if Noor did claim to have feared for his life, that fear was not \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and therefore the use of deadly force was not justified. \u201cIn the short time between when Ms Damond Ruszczyk approached the squad car and the time that Noor fired the fatal shot, there is no evidence that officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,\u201d Freeman said in prepared remarks. \u201cInstead, officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his handgun from the passenger seat, in disregard for human life.\u201d The officers did not turn on their body cameras until after the shooting and there was no squad camera video. The lack of video was widely criticized, and Damond\u2019s family members were among the many people who called for changes in procedure, including how often officers are required to turn on their cameras. Damond\u2019s family in the US and Australia released a statement through their lawyer, Robert Bennett, saying that they were \u201cpleased\u201d with Freeman\u2019s decision to bring charges against Noor. \u201cNo charges can bring our Justine back,\u201d they said. \u201cHowever, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect, and today\u2019s actions reflect that.\u201d Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on Islamic Relations, said the Somali and Muslim communities in Minnesota \u201cstand with Justine\u201d and were asking for justice, while at the same time questioning why police leaders and the police union had opted to not defend Noor in the same way they had officers involved in past police shootings. Hussein said while Noor is Somali American his actions did not reflect on his community. \u201cWe need to recognize him for who he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was trained by the police department. He acted as a police officer. Mr Noor is responsible for his actions.\u201d A group of Damond\u2019s neighbors who have helped to form an advocacy group, Justice for Justine, attended the press confernce and were planning a rally on Tuesday evening. Sarah Kuhnen, who lived a block away from where Damond died, said she was glad to see charges finally announced in the case. \u201cI also have a very heavy heart for all those impacted by police violence who have never seen charges,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is that this will be the first of many charges for police who have disproportionately impacted communities of color. This is a very emotional day.\u201d If convicted of third-degree murder, Noor could face a maximum of 25 years in prison, though the presumptive sentence is 12 years. A judge could issue a sentence ranging from about 10 to 15 years. The second-degree manslaughter charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison but the presumptive sentence is four years. Bail has been set at $500,000, according to jail records."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
