The virtual debate, staged through separate video links to ensure safety amid the pandemic, was a chance for voters to get to grips with one of the most volatile and chaotic races in the nation. Some 20 candidates are standing in a race which, as a special election, had no primary. Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat in January following the resignation of Johnny Isakson, is having to fend off a fierce challenge from Doug Collins, an avidly Trump-supporting congressman. The pair have been scrambling over each other in a rapid dash to the right, trying to outdo the other in their radical conservative credentials. An exchange between Collins and Loeffler featured sparring on a personal angle. \u201cYou\u2019ve attacked my hair, my makeup, how I talk, my clothes, where I\u2019m from,\u201d Loeffler said, adding: \u201cI am the true conservative. I don\u2019t have to have a record I have to lie about,\u201d the Gainesville Times reported. Collins shot back: \u201cI\u2019ve never mentioned anything personally \u2013 her fixtures, hair or anything else. But it\u2019s amazing what she [says] about me.\u201d Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King preached for eight years, asked Collins if he would condemn QAnon. That is the virulent conspiracy theory rapidly which claims a cabal of Democrats and billionaires is running a paedophile and human trafficking ring and which the FBI has warned is a domestic terrorism threat. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with QAnon \u2026 and don\u2019t support them,\u201d Collins said. Loeffler said: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about QAnon.\u201d However, last week Loeffler appeared at a press conference with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has spoken favorably about QAnon in the past, to accept the latter\u2019s endorsement. Greene, who has no Democratic opponent in a staunchly conservative House district in north-west Georgia, has made racist statements and was an early adopter of QAnon From 2017 Greene was an active proponent of QAnon, publicly praising its anonymous originator as a patriot who \u201cvery much loves his country\u201d and is \u201con the same page as us\u201d. More recently she claimed to have moved away from the movement, telling Fox News she was not a QAnon candidate. At last week\u2019s event, Loeffler tried to bat away the controversy, telling reporters: \u201cNo one in Georgia cares about the QAnon business.\u201d Warnock, by contrast, has successfully united his party. Recent polls put Warnock at around 31%, Loeffler at 23% and Collins at 22%. Under special election rules, the race will go into a January run-off between the top two should none of the candidates secure at least 50% of the vote. Most observers expect a head-to-head between Warnock and the winner of Loeffler and Collins\u2019s bitter fight on the right. QAnon\u2019s fantasies have caused considerable difficulties for Republicans in the 2020 election cycle. Last week Trump declined to denounce the conspiracy theory, praising it for being \u201cstrongly against paedophilia\u201d. On Sunday, the chair of the Republican national committee, Ronna McDaniel, similarly sidestepped questions on QAnon during an appearance on ABC News. Asked if she would condemn it, she replied: \u201c I knew you were going to ask me that question. I knew it because it\u2019s something the voters are not even thinking about. It\u2019s a fringe group. It\u2019s not part of our party.\u201d The Loeffler battle is one of two US Senate races in Georgia that goes to the polls on 3 November. In the second contest, the incumbent Republican David Perdue is in an exceptionally tight fight against the Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue he took the stage at a Trump rally last week and mangled Kamala Harris\u2019s name, which unleashed a flood of almost $2m into Ossoff\u2019s already swollen campaign coffers. Perdue\u2019s insulting jab also earned a riposte from Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019s husband. He said: \u201cLet me help what\u2019s-his-face pronounce this: M-V-P. If he can\u2019t remember her name, how about Madam Vice-President?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
