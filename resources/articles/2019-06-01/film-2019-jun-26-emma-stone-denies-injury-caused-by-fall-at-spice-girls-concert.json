The Sun reported that Stone broke her shoulder after falling to the ground as she was sitting on a friend\u2019s shoulders at the concert on 13 June at Wembley; she had been photographed with group member Emma Bunton before the show. The report also stated it took Stone a few days to realise the extent of the injury. However, a source close to the actor said she hurt her shoulder after \u201cslipping on a floor\u201d at home. The Sun\u2019s report claimed that the film, due to start shooting in London this summer, was \u201cin crisis\u201d because Stone\u2019s injury would affect her ability to play the role. However, the same source also denied this, saying: \u201cProduction on her next film had not yet begun and this is not causing major issues in any way. They continue to be in pre-production and she\u2019ll begin once healed.\u201d Cruella is directed by Craig Gillespie and is due for release on 23 December 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
