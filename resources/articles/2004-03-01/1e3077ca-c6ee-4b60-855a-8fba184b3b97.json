Interpublic, which owns the McCann-Erickson and Lowe Worldwide agencies, made a fourth-quarter net loss of \u00a356m, compared with an \u00a311m net profit a year earlier. The fourth-quarter net loss includes a \u00a321m charge from the sale of legendary motor sports circuit Brands Hatch and three other UK racing tracks. Interpublic announced in January it had sold Brands Hatch, Oulton Park, Cadwell Park and Snetterton to a new company called MotorSport Vision for an undisclosed sum, though it retained the rights to the Silverstone track and the British grand prix. The US giant also took a \u00a322m hit on restructuring costs, as well as \u00a323m in impairment charges from a decline in the value of minority stakes in some international investments. It said the restructuring programme, which is likely to save about \u00a3100m a year, will continue during the first half of 2004. The programme, which is trying to reshape businesses acquired over the last decade, will not cost more than \u00a3135m, the company said. A year ago Interpublic shares plunged to a 10-year low when it revealed its profits fell 79% in the last quarter of 2002. The company's chairman, David Bell, said at the time that Interpublic's performance was \"unacceptable\" and the company was \"digging out from a deep pit\". Today Mr Bell said the company was continuing \"to move aggressively to eliminate financial and legal issues\", claiming \"the first phase of our turnaround will soon be behind us\". \"We have identified many areas of opportunity and we are making headway, but there remains much work ahead of us,\" he said in a statement. Interpublic said organic revenue - excluding the impact of fluctuating exchange rates, disposals and acquisitions - fell by 1.1% in the fourth quarter and by 3.6% over the whole of 2003. \u00b7 French advertising group Publicis today reported net profit of \u00a3101m in 2003, compared with \u00a399m the previous year. Publicis, the world's fourth largest advertising and marketing group, also said operating income last year was \u00a3374m, up from \u00a3290m in 2002. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
