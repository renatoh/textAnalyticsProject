In the 19 seconds of footage, Donald Trump\u2019s daughter attempts to join a conversation between French president Emmanuel Macron, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde and British prime minister Theresa May. Among widespread reaction on social media, most of it critical of the first daughter, the New York Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said such behaviour \u201churts our diplomatic standing\u201d. Ivanka Trump has been criticised before for appearing to stand in for her father at international summits, for example during a discussion on health and migration in Africa at the 2017 G20 in Hamburg. In the video released by the Elys\u00e9e Palace, Macron can be heard to make a point about \u201csocial justice\u201d, to which Trump, standing to his right, says either \u201cit\u2019s on\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s all\u201d. May answers Macron, saying: \u201cAs soon as you start talking about the economic aspect of it, though, a lot of people start listening who wouldn\u2019t otherwise listen.\u201d Trump agrees, and says: \u201cAnd the same with the defence side, I think, in terms of the whole sort of\u2026\u201d Standing to Trump\u2019s right, Lagarde looks steadily at Trudeau. The president\u2019s daughter tails off, gesturing with her hands. \u201c\u2026being very male dominated,\u201d she says, nodding. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d In her tweet about the video, Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cIt may be shocking to some, but being someone\u2019s daughter actually isn\u2019t a career qualification. It hurts our diplomatic standing when the president phones it in [and] the world moves on. \u201cThe US needs our president working the G20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d After the G20 in Japan, during which Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner attended talks with China about trade, the Trumps proceeded to South Korea. On Sunday father and daughter took an unprecedented diplomatic step, through the Demilitarised Zone and into North Korean territory. Ivanka Trump pronounced the experience \u201csurreal\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
