Last night during the first and only vice-presidential debate against Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Trump\u2019s VP pick stayed calm and confident while Kaine interrupted constantly and appeared nervous. \u201cHe was phenomenal \u2013 he was cool, he was smart \u2013 he was meant to be doing what he\u2019s doing, and we are very very proud of Governor Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike Pence,\u201d said Trump on Wednesday. Media coverage and polling declared Pence the clear winner last night. Republicans came out declaring the debate made them wish Pence was the nominee rather than Trump. It was a contrast to last Monday\u2019s presidential debate when Hillary Clinton emerged the victor in the polls, following Donald Trump\u2019s under-prepared performance. Trump has since claimed that microphone issues had affected him, and that online polls declared him the winner \u2013 despite reports claiming those numbers were rigged by Trump supporters. But Trump made sure to claim last night\u2019s win as his own; part of his narrative of being a successful businessman who knows how to make deals. \u201cI\u2019d argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of vice president debates, and last night Americans also got to look firsthand at my judgment \u2013 you need judgment for people, for deals,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWell, Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America \u2013 his opponent only talked about small and petty distractions,\u201d said Trump in Nevada. But during the debate, Kaine mostly focused on things that Trump had said or done. Kaine questioned Trump\u2019s behavior, such as saying women should be punished for getting abortions (a statement he later backtracked), that Vladimir Putin was a better leader than President Obama or his plans to build a wall between Mexico and the United States."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
