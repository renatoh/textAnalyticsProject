Ratcliffe, who is on hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London to protest against his wife\u2019s continued detention by Tehran, said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s failure to take responsibility for his own mistakes makes me question his ability to protect our security.\u201d He said his protest was getting under the skin of embassy staff and leading to an increase in harassment. Ratcliffe had earlier accused Johnson of making mistakes and false promises that enabled his wife\u2019s Iranian jailers to discredit the case for her release. Ratcliffe said a story in the Sun newspaper, written on the day he met Johnson as foreign secretary, had given him false hope and antagonised the Iranians. The story claimed Johnson had won a Whitehall agreement to repay a \u00a3400m debt owed by the British government to the Iranians arising from the sale of Chieftain tanks in the 1970s. He said the story turned out to be a bigger problem for her cause than an earlier mistake by Johnson at a foreign affairs select committee hearing, in which he said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Tehran. Her family insist she was on holiday. Ratcliffe said the mistake by Johnson at the hearing was still being used by Iranian news outlets to justify laying a second set of charges against her. His allies say the error at the hearing may have been off the cuff, but the Sun briefing was a considered decision by a senior political figure in the Foreign Office that raised expectations in Tehran, but served only to deepen the distrust of Johnson. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s MP, Tulip Siddiq, challenged Johnson to explain his role in possibly briefing that the UK government was prepared to t pay the \u00a3400m debt to Iran. She said: \u201cIf Boris Johnson claims that he or his team was not responsible for briefing the debt payment story then he should publicly deny it - as it seemed to be attempting to relieve the pressure caused by his own gaffe. \u201cIf he did suggest that payment was imminent, Boris Johnson cruelly raised the hopes of the families involved and made matters much worse by failing to deliver.\u201d Ratcliffe, speaking on BBC radio, said: \u201cPromises have consequences. Perhaps the bigger problem was when the press was briefed the money was going to be paid. Expectations were raised. He [Johnson] said no stone was going to be left unturned and obviously that did not happen. She remains in prison and others have been arrested, and so we have gone from \u2018no stone unturned\u2019 to \u2018not my fault\u2019.\u201d Johnson, in the BBC TV Conservative leadership debate on Tuesday, claimed his mistake at the select committee had made no difference, but he has never been asked whether he played a role in the briefing of the press about the repayment of the Chieftain tank debt. The story in the Sun, marked \u201cexclusive\u201d, said Johnson and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, had authorised government lawyers to finally settle the 38-year dispute over the tank deal. In fact, resistance in Whitehall, both in the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury, left Iran still fighting in the courts last month to recoup the money, as well as the outstanding interest. Ratcliffe is on hunger strike in solidarity with his wife, who is herself on hunger strike in a Tehran jail over the continued threats to impose a second set of charges against her. Ratcliffe accused Tehran of using her jailing as a pawn in a wider diplomatic battle with the UK both over the tank debt and more broadly to press the UK to do more to support the Iran nuclear deal. Asked if Johnson was wrong to say his words at the hearing had made no difference, Ratcliffe said: \u201cYes, of course they had consequences. The main difference they had is obviously they enabled a propaganda campaign that was run against Nazanin a couple of weeks afterwards, accusing her of being a spy and that the foreign secretary had proved it. It has very traumatic consequences for her. \u201cIt was used to justify the second court case. It did not cause the second court case, but was used to justify it and has been used to discredit her ever since. A couple of weeks ago there was stuff on Press TV, an Iranian press outlet, again recycling his words, saying, listen, the foreign secretary confirmed she was there working when she was not.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the current foreign secretary and a rival for the Tory leadership, refused to criticise Johnson, saying point scoring would be unseemly. \u201cMy job is to get her out,\u201d he added. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Tulip Siddiq\u2019s name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
