The figure, which the Association of British Insurers (ABI) described as a working estimate, includes \u00a3900m in business disruption claims, \u00a3275m in travel claims and \u00a325m for customers covering weddings, school trips and other events. The initial total compares with more than \u00a3400m for the two February storms this year. The ABI said that while most businesses did not have cover against Covid-19, some of those that did were likely to make substantial claims. It added that because such cover was rare, insurers had not built up reserves to pay claims. The spotlight has been on the industry since the crisis began, as businesses have faced problems making claims. While some have discovered they were not covered under the terms of their policy, others claim that insurers are not meeting their promises. On Thursday, 100 pubs and bars said they were taking legal action against the insurer Hiscox over its response to business interruption claims. The ABI\u2019s director general, Huw Evans, said insurers were \u201cpainfully aware that the majority of businesses are uninsured for global pandemics\u201d. He said: \u201cAlthough ABI members expect to pay \u00a3900m in business interruption claims, most policyholders are not covered for pandemic losses. \u201cWe agree strongly that the UK should examine public-private partnerships to find a lasting solution, to enable more affordable, more extensive pandemic insurance cover to be available to those firms who want it.\u201d The chair of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Mel Stride, urged insurers to be clear and fair in their dealings with customers. He said UKHospitality, a trade body for hotels, pubs and bars, had reported that 71% of its members had had claims rejected. Stride said: \u201cThere may be many instances where individuals and businesses believe they are covered, but in reality may not be. However, we are concerned that the insurance sector goes the extra mile in meeting claims wherever possible.\u201d The ABI\u2019s estimate does not include claims made through Lloyd\u2019s and the London Market, so is not an estimate of the total UK cost of the crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
