Today is the coxless pairs decider between James Cracknell and Matthew Pinsent and the Australians Drew Ginn and James Tomkins, who have won both previous encounters. Physically the British have the edge, mentally the Aussies. The team forever in the pairs' shadow - the coxless four of Steve Williams, Josh West, Toby Garbett and Rick Dunn - are Britain's next best medal hope today. The four won last year with Ed Coode, and should do so again with the equally able West. Matt Wells and Ian Lawson are surprise finalists in the double sculls but show every indication they will get a medal. Frances Houghton and Debbie Flood are also in the hunt, along with the lightweight eight and women's double sculls. The remaining golden chances tomorrow rest with the men's coxed four and the lightweight pair Naomi Ashcroft and Leonie Barron."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
