The business secretary was at the Airbus UK plant, in which BAE has no stake (A week is a long time in politics, page 9, 15 August). \u2022\u2008An editing change caused a review of the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain to attribute the song Teenage Dirtbag to Weezer when the group's name was actually Wheatus (Proms 44 &amp; 45: BFO/Fischer, 20 August, page 38). \u2022\u2008In a story about rooms in the Venice area said to have been advertised by mistake for one European cent, we should have named the hotel chain involved as Crowne Plaza, not Crown Plaza. The headquarters of the chain's overall owner, InterContinental Hotels Group, should have been given as Denham, Buckinghamshire, not Atlanta, Georgia, which is the company's base for the Americas (Hotel's rooms for 1p blunder costs thousands, 15 August, page 17). \u2022\u2008The birthdays column on 18 August shaved a year off Robert Redford's age: the actor-director was 73 that day, not 72 as we \u2013 and our source, Who's Who \u2013 said (page 34). \u2022\u2008A comment piece about achievement and frailty in the lives of artistic greats mentioned Wagner's reminder to his favourite Vienna chambermaid to wear purple knickers next time they met. A Wagner expert points out that the pants in question were pink (To understand genius, forget the purple knickers, 19 August, page 28)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
