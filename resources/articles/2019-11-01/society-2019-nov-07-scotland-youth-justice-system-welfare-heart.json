She offers him reassurance. \u201cIt\u2019s your hearing,\u201d Gibson* tells him. \u201cIf there are any changes you want to make in your present circumstances, you can let us know. But you\u2019re very smiley and very happy, which is an indication.\u201d They are sitting in a nondescript room in an office block in central Glasgow, its bland magnolia and lilac walls hung with prints of historic Glaswegian landmarks, for a children\u2019s panel hearing to review Robert\u2019s case. Now 16, and estranged from his mother, he has been in foster care for five years. Around the beech-veneered table are three panel members, lay volunteers with significant legal powers, with his records spread out before them. He has run away from home, escaping domestic violence, and been involved in substance abuse and risky behaviour, both on the streets and on social media. Robert sits opposite them, flanked by his foster mother and a social worker, his legs tucked under his chair. A children\u2019s reporter, a trained investigator who leads on cases, takes notes from a desk nearby. \u201cYou tell us anything you\u2019re feeling; anything at all,\u201d Robert is told by Stephen Black, one of the panel members. The children\u2019s panel system was introduced across Scotland in 1971, following a seminal report by Lord Kilbrandon, a judge, recommending a wholly different approach to supporting children in crisis focused on welfare and protection. There are no juvenile courts in Scotland, unless the case involves the most serious crimes such as homicide or rape, which go into the mainstream legal system. There are no prosecutors or police officers sitting in, even though 75% of cases are referred by the police and prosecutors allocate the most serious cases. Nor are the panel members magistrates or judges. They act instead as the child\u2019s guarantors, often directing social work departments and schools to put in place tailored support and services. Nearly 13,000 children were referred to the children\u2019s hearing system last year, from infants to teenagers of 17, with nearly 3,560 of those going before a children\u2019s panel \u2013 cases where measures such as compulsory supervision orders (CSOs) or, in emergency, high-risk cases, child protection orders are considered. Around 85% of cases are so-called care and protection, dealing with children\u2019s welfare. The remainder, including Robert\u2019s, involve offending behaviour \u2013 conduct that in an adult system would be treated as a crime. That can include assaults, vandalism or abusive behaviour. It is a welfare-driven approach, said Neil Hunter, the chief executive of the Scottish Children\u2019s Reporter Administration, which employs the professionals who support children\u2019s panels. \u201cA young person involved in offending or other harmful behaviours is a manifestation of other issues in their wider life \u2013 education, social, psychological or emotional,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt is a manifestation of something which needs a welfare-based approach; it is about trying to get to the root cause.\u201d Robert\u2019s panel agreed to extend his CSO for another year, legally requiring Glasgow\u2019s social work department to keep his support in place. Scottish councils are under intense financial pressure, services and schools overstretched, and the CSO protects Robert\u2019s position. In his case that also means a part-time school timetable focusing on a handful of essential subjects, including English. Robert is a success story. Nurtured by his foster mum, he has become a keen horse rider, an enthusiastic volunteer at a local stables, and plans a career in equestrian sports. \u201cRobert has just thrived with that, and he is daft with the horses,\u201d his social worker tells the panel. \u201cRobert is definitely on the right path and needs time to ensure he continues on the right path,\u201d says Gibson. There are 36 children\u2019s hearing centres scattered around Scotland, and a committee of children involved in the system have recently begun influencing the design of centres. Hearing rooms are being fitted out with sofas; the Stirling centre now has a sensory garden. Glasgow\u2019s centre, the largest, covers four floors and its ground floor reception area and corridor is decorated with brightly coloured motifs \u2013 flowers, branches, butterflies, meadows and songbirds. Hunter said the panels searched for a root cause to the offence, the truanting or the substance abuse. They looked for trauma, adversity or perhaps abuse. From there they looked for the right remedy. He described it as a whole-system approach, based on early intervention. Referrals tend to be for children with the most complex needs. The preventative approach appears to be working as the number of children formally entering the hearings system is falling. There were 23,140 referrals last year (some children are referred multiple times), down 2.8% year on year. \u201cHearings aren\u2019t interested in innocence or guilt. The children\u2019s hearing is only concerned with the young person\u2019s welfare,\u201d said Hunter. They \u201clisten really hard to the young person, and listen really hard to the family, and to the professionals. They aggregate that to decide whether the young person needs the protection of the law.\u201d * Some names in this article have been changed for reasons of confidentiality"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
