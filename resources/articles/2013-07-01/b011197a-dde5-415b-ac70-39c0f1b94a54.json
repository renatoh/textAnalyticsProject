What a beguiling little film that was. In keeping with tradition, I'm going to slope off during the credits. I can understand why people were so desperate to see the film again now \u2013 I'm sure it'll make a lot more sense a second time around. But it'll probably take me a while to build up enough momentum to actually want to watch it again. Momentum and stocks of headache tablets. Still, thanks so much for reading and commenting along. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I\u2019m @StuHeritage. Follow me and we can all hold each other. Good luck sleeping tonight. And this is how it ends. Everyone is dead \u2013 especially Michael Smiley, whose face gets splattered across the entire field \u2013 except for Shearsmith, who wears Smiley's hat, eats a casserole made of mushrooms and (perhaps) a human heart, puts a stone circle back together and walks off. Which probably means that he's become the devil. Which probably means that this has the exact same ending as Kill List. It's honestly quite hard to tell at this point. It's been insinuated that the treasure they were all looking for was the sense of friendship that existed between everyone. Which makes A Field in England the most relentlessly unsettling Care Bears film ever made. Shearsmith and Pooboy now have a gun. This will probably end in a shootout between them and Smiley. Or, because this is this film, it'll end in something I don't understand and yet simultaneously find disturbing. Oh, wait, it is ending with a shootout. Smiley's now killed someone else, by shooting them in the mouth, and Reese Shearsmith's face is now locked firmly into the Jack Nicholson At The End Of The Shining position. The wind must've changed. For the record, I literally have no idea what's going on any more. That's as much about my career as this film. Also, I'd like to make a correction. This isn't a quarter to eleven at night on Film4 film. This is a quarter to three in the morning on a minor Estonian arts channel film. In the best possible way, obviously. And now there's a gale. And some fancy editing. And some backwards footage of a cloak flapping around. And a slowed-down gong noise. This bit, I expect, is what the epilepsy warning at the star of the film was for, because it's managed to give me a right old headache. Now we're getting somewhere. Shearsmith is gorging himself on mushrooms, and there's a two-minute montage of mushroom close-ups. Call this a hunch, but I think that mushrooms might be quite important to the next bit. So far, it's fair to say that not an awful lot has happened. But that might change now. They've found the treasure they were looking for and \u2013 get this \u2013 that pub they were looking for never actually existed. And Shearsmith finally looks like he's on the verge of having that psychedelic freakout that he's been promising to have for about 45 minutes. Oh no, Baldrick's dead. His final words: \"Can you get a word to my wife? Tell her I hate her. Tell her I loved her sister\". Poor Baldrick. He was my favourite one. Anyway, here's where we are with the story. Michael Smiley is probably the devil, everyone else is digging a hole and trying to kill each other, and Reese Shearsmith is hallucinating giant black suns. I'll explain why, but only after I've seen this another five or six times. This film, penises aside, is very pretty. There's a masterclass making-of video on the Film4 website that probably explains how they made it look so good. Watch it after the film. And there's our first penis. Civil war penises are not attractive. Who knew? \"I think I know what God is punishing us for\" says Baldrick. \"Everything\". At this point, I'd guess that everybody's probably forgotten about going to the pub. Very good call casting Reese Shearsmith as a man who runs around pulling faces and vomiting blood. If there's one thing the man can do, it's chew scenery. This was the role he was born to play. Well, that was weird. Reese Shearsmith is staggering out of the tent, now that he's finished screaming. He's attached to a rope and gurning like an Aphex Twin mask. It's profoundly unsettling. Hey Twitter, you were right. Screaming. Bloodshed. Baldrick chanting. And - wait - I'd been warned about this bit on Twitter. Oh, hang on. It's gone black. And there's screaming. This cannot be good. Michael Smiley's playing the old 'You didn't capture me, because I captured you' trick on the Reese Shearsmith character. Which, if you're interested, doesn't really work if you try it on a policeman if he catches you breaking into a house. I heard. Also, I can't help thinking that Kasabian are probably watching this and making notes in a book called 'What We're Going To Wear On Our 20th Anniversary Reunion Tour'. God, I hope that's not the case. Putting this on at quarter to eleven at night on Film4 seems like a brilliant move now that the film's a third of the way through. It is a very quarter to eleven at night on Film4 film. It seems as if A Field In England isn't about four blokes going to the pub any more. They've just found Michael Smiley \u2013 who may or may not be invisible \u2013 in a mushroom field, and beaten the crap out of him. And now the Essex boy is staring at his hand. He's probably going to peel it like an orange. I've heard that mushrooms make people do that. The characters so far: a milquetoast, an Essex boy, a man who poos and then swears about pooing and a mysterious fourth. And they're all going to the pub. Throw in a fence joke and you've basically got The World's End. \"What line of work are you in, squire?\" \"Buttons\" \"I'm going to have a shit\". There are some long, long dialogue scenes here \u2013 Peter Bradshaw's comparisons to Dennis Potter are starting to make sense. So, the story so far: four Civil War deserters are walking through a field, swearing and arguing and looking for a pub. After all the noise and squall of the beginning, this is settling into a more low-key groove. Which probably means that things are going to get very nasty very quickly. And strobey, if the warning before the film started was any indication. Ben Wheatley's good at sound, isn't he? The scariest thing about Kill List was probably all the rumbles and screams, and this seems just as inventive so far. This is shaping up to be a grubby 90 minutes. Everyone's covered in mud, and screaming, and crawling through bushes. Three minutes and we've already seen two dead bodies. I'm going to enjoy this, if I don't wet myself first. OK, A Field In England is about to begin. This is exciting. Don't forget to turn your mobile phones off. But keep your laptops on, so that you can follow the liveblog. Yes, look, I know it's counterintuitive. Shh. Hush also appears to be playing the theme-tune to the TV show Cheaters over its end credits. This endears me to it enormously. Film4's lead-in to A Field in England, incidentally, is 2009's Hush \u2013 a film that pretty much appears to exclusively consist of swearwords and screaming. My nerves are already shredded, so god knows what I'll be like by midnight. TWITTER REACTION UPDATE: Twitter is now almost unilaterally going \"Why the hell are you liveblogging a film, you idiot?\" In other news, I might close Twitter for a bit. I\u2019ve been trying to gauge the reaction to the film on Twitter today. So far, the overwhelming response from those who've seen it has been positive. Lots of people have called it \u2018a trip\u2019, which I think means \u2018I probably don\u2019t have a clue what I\u2019ve just seen\u2019. Others have said that they need to see it again, which I think means 'I definitely don't have a clue what I've just seen'. Which means that, if I've got this right, I'll have a full-blown nervous breakdown at roughly 11:30pm. Keep your eyes peeled for that. Stuart Heritage here. Welcome to a very special Guardian liveblog. In three quarters of an hour, Ben Wheatley\u2019s new movie A Field in England will premiere on Film4, on the same day that it\u2019s released in cinemas and on-demand. But pioneering distribution models be damned \u2013 I\u2019m liveblogging the film because it\u2019s a new Ben Wheatley film, and I like Ben Wheatley. Down Terrace and Sightseers were both brilliant, and just thinking about Kill List makes me want to burst into tears and run to my mum. Even Wheatley\u2019s Go Compare adverts are good, which isn\u2019t something I ever thought I\u2019d say. The reviews for A Field in England seem to suggest that Wheatley's purple patch continues unabated; Peter Bradshaw called it \u2018grisly and visceral\u2019 and \u2018a punk nightmare\u2019 in his four star review. Combined with this alternative trailer that went online last week, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the next couple of hours. That said, some of my colleagues have implied that this might not be the easiest film to follow. \u201cPoor Stuart\u201d said Catherine Shoard during this week\u2019s Guardian Film Show when the topic of this liveblog came up. So, just to forewarn you, while this liveblog might end up being seen as the vanguard of film appreciation in the digital age, it could just as easily turn into a stark warning about the thundering pointlessness of liveblogging afilm. Either way, it\u2019ll probably be fun. Or scary. Or a complete and total waste of everybody\u2019s resources. Definitely one of those three things. The comments are open below, so do feel free to chime in with your observations on the film, and I\u2019ll be back here at 10:45 when it all starts happening. Hello and welcome to our live blog of Ben Wheatley's new film A Field in England, which is making waves not only for its trippy civil war story but also for its pioneering release strategy. Not only is it going into cinemas today, but it's also showing on TV tonight (starting at 10.45pm on the Film4 channel). Stuart Heritage will be here later on to keep you company during the broadcast, but meanwhile, here's a few things to help you get prepared. Watch the trailer here, read Peter Bradshaw's four-star review here, Phelim O'Neill's article about the thinking behind the simultaneous cinema/TV release here, and The Guide's interview with the man himself, Ben Wheatley, here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
