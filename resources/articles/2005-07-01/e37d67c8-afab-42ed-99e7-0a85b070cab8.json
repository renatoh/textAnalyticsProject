New owner Blackstone Capital Partners will combine the Legoland assets with Sea Life aquariums and London Dungeons owner Merlin, which it bought in May. Lego will have a 30% stake in the enlarged group, which will be called Merlin Entertainments Group. Lego chief executive Jorgen Vig Knudstorp said it was important the com pany retained an interest in Legoland to protect the brand. The fourth generation family-owned Danish company has retreated to its core business of coloured plastic building blocks after recording its worst ever loss last year. The new Merlin Entertainments Group will be the ninth largest themed attraction company in the world, with 12 million visitors. New chief executive Nick Varney said it was likely the company would be floated within three to five years. In the immediate future, Merlin will focus on cross-promoting the four Lego theme parks in Denmark, Windsor, California and Bavaria with the Sea Life and Earth Explorer theme park chains it owns throughout Europe. \"They all target families with young children and are about fun learning,\" Mr Varney said. \"As a product, Legoland parks are extremely high quality.\" Merlin also plans to develop the Legolands into \"destination\" resorts with hotels and other Merlin attractions. In the longer term it could build a fifth Legoland theme park and smaller, indoor Legolands Legoland earned \u20ac36m (\u00a325m) last year from 5.7 million visitors. Merlin earned \u00a314.5m from 6.3 million visitors. By combining the two, Merlin hopes to boost the profitability of all the theme parks in its portfolio. The six-year-old existing Merlin business includes 19 Sea Life centres, three marine sanctuaries, four Dungeon attractions and an Earth Explorer Park in Belgium. Blackstone bought Merlin with a view to combining it with Legoland, which was put up for sale last year. It successfully outbid US private equity firm Apollo and London's Palamon Capital Partners for Legoland. Mr Knudstorp said the Legoland sale solved Lego's short-term debt crisis, and enabled it to focus on its longer term problem of falling prices for Lego products. \"I don't think [selling Legoland] is the key to saving Lego in what has become a very negative toy market,\" he said. \"We need to come up with more innovations so that even though retailers are less interested in selling toys, even though children are less interested in traditional toys, Lego is still a toy they want.\" Lego lost a record 2bn Danish kroner (\u00a3185m) last year after it wrote down assets and embarked on a restructuring to resuscitate the 71-year-old business. At the end of 2004 it was carrying Dkr 8bn debt. Under new chief executive Mr Knudstorp, Lego has boosted market share by 0.5% to claim 3% of global toy sales and expects to return to the black next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
