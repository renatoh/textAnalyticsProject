His blog post was headlined, \u201cHA HA\u201d. \u201cCelebrate with me,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s hammer home the lessons. \u201cSome gloating will be unavoidable.\u201d His guest on Sky After Dark was fellow presenter Rowan Dean, who was \u201cabsolutely\u201d still tipping a Trump win, and suggesting the Democrats would cheat: \u201cDonald Trump is right. The Democrats will stop at nothing, pull every trick in the book.\u201d But later in the evening Bolt had stopped gloating and was eating humble pie, posting an update on the Herald Sun blog which said \u201cLate count swings to Biden\u201d and amending his snappy headline to \u201cHA HA (UH OH)\u201d. On Thursday Bolt took a more sober view, saying Trump\u2019s accusations of voting fraud were dangerous. \u201cHe wants [his supporters] to feel a rage that will feed any political or media career for the next four years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGood for him. Not good for democracy.\u201d Claiming victory Bolt and Dean were not the only Sky After Dark pundits with egg on their faces. Following Bolt on Sky at 8pm was Alan Jones who was adamant \u201cTrump will win comfortably\u201d. He declared Joe Biden was a \u201clunatic\u201d and a prisoner of the left, saying: \u201cThank God this bloke won\u2019t be the president.\u201d Meanwhile Sky\u2019s political editor, Andrew Clennell, was roasted on Twitter after he was quoted in a Sky News tweet as saying Biden \u201cjust tried to claim victory in the US presidential election\u201d, when in fact the Democratic candidate said he believed he was on track to win. Luckily for the After Dark crew, not many people witnessed their early celebration of Trump\u2019s \u201cwin\u201d. Unlike Fox News in the US, which dominated election night with 13.7 million viewers, Sky News Australia\u2019s biggest audience for election night was for Bolt\u2019s show: 101,000 viewers nationally. By the time Jones rocked up at 8pm, the audience had shrunk to 62,000. Running on empty symbolism The Australian interpreted Trump\u2019s stronger than expected showing as a loss for the \u201cso-called progressive Twitterati, elites and chattering classes\u201d. In an editorial in Thursday\u2019s paper, editor-in-chief Chris Dore thundered that \u201cprogressive ideology and empty woke symbolism took a big hit\u201d, adding that the paper\u2019s own commentators had their fingers on the pulse the whole time. \u201cWiser heads, such as [US correspondent] Cameron Stewart and Greg Sheridan, knew Mr Trump was always in striking distance and had a pathway to re-election.\u201d Glaring deficiencies The ABC, which had a huge surge in audiences across TV and online for its comprehensive coverage, had a few of its own issues, mainly concerning the placement of the set for the live broadcast. The US Votes set was constructed in the atrium at ABC headquarters in Ultimo, and as the sun moved it bathed presenters Stan Grant and Ellen Fanning in ghostly light. Fanning eventually popped on a pair of sunnies to deal with the glare. The ABC News website had 5.1 million visitors, which was higher than usual but not as high as some of the early Covid-driven audiences. The combined reach for the US election coverage across the ABC and the ABC News channel was 3.48 million metro viewers, or 19.7% of the metro population. During the day the ABC was the most watched channel as viewers flocked to the rolling news about Trump v Biden, but after 6pm Nine was No 1 due to the State of Origin match. The ABC\u2019s national news special at 7pm, hosted by Leigh Sales, had 641,000 viewers on the main channel and another 212,000 on the news channel. But it was all outshone by the State of Origin on Nine on 1.6m. Some people, including ABC host Charlie Pickering, took issue with an ABC news alert that failed to point out that Trump\u2019s claim the election was fraudulent was unfounded. Other news outlets were quick to point out the truth, including National Public Radio in the US, which tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump has falsely claimed that he has won the 2020 election. That is wrong. Millions of votes are still being counted in key states.\u201d 60 Minutes founder mourned The founder of Channel Nine\u2019s current affairs program 60 Minutes, Gerald Stone, has died aged 87. Stone\u2019s creation of the wildly popular Sunday night show for the late media mogul Kerry Packer made household names of reporters Jana Wendt, Ian Leslie, Ray Martin and George Negus. Interviews with foreign leaders and international stars and reports from hotspots around the world made the show a \u201cwatercooler hit\u201d under his watch, between 1979 and 1992. Negus\u2019s confrontation with Margaret Thatcher in 1981 was a classic of the genre. When Negus asked the then prime minister why Britons called her pig-headed, Thatcher bristled and said: \u201cWill you tell me who stopped you in the street and told you that?\u201d Nine\u2019s chief executive, Hugh Marks, told staff on Friday a memorial for Stone would be held at Nine\u2019s Willoughby studios, where the program was originally produced. \u201cThere\u2019s been an army of tremendously talented people in Australian television since its arrival in 1956, but none with more impact than Gerald Stone,\u201d Marks said. Stone never stopped working and was a prolific author, writing bestsellers about his former employers: Compulsive Viewing: The Inside Story of Packer\u2019s Nine Network and Who Killed Channel 9? The Death of Kerry Packer\u2019s Mighty TV Dream Machine. He edited the Bulletin, served on the SBS board for 10 years and in 2015 was made a member of the Order of Australia (AM) for \u201csignificant service to print and broadcast media as a journalist, editor, television producer and author\u201d. Lost in translation The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age\u2019s European correspondent, Bevan Shields, reached out to his friends on Twitter when news broke of the shootings in Vienna on Tuesday. With the news unfolding fast, he appealed for help with translations: \u201cHello Twitter Friends \u2013 do any of you speak Austrian?\u201d No one did and Shields quickly deleted the call-out. Culture club Australia\u2019s second annual Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) was held in Sydney on Wednesday and my colleague Michael McGowan was lucky enough to be among the attending media, whose passes were labelled \u201cfake news\u201d. But that was the most amusing part of the day, which saw a parade of media figures, including Jones, Dean, the ABC\u2019s Tom Switzer and Bettina Arndt take to the stage to wage their culture wars. New SBS board member Warren Mundine, who was handpicked for the role by the government, told the audience he was there to dispel some myths about Indigenous Australia, ending his rambling speech with: \u201cAustralia is not a racist country, black lives matter, blue lives matter, all lives matter.\u201d SBS, meanwhile, says anything Mundine says on Twitter or any other platform is his personal view. After Mundine attacked the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, on Twitter, we asked SBS if there was a code of conduct for SBS board members to comply with. \u201cThe views of Mr Mundine on Twitter and other non-SBS owned platforms are his personal views,\u201d a spokesman told Weekly Beast. No thanks It was supposed to be a feel-good campaign for Woolworths Supermarkets, which recognised frontline workers who put themselves on the line during the coronavirus pandemic. Workers who are nominated by the public in the Thanks a Million program could receive a $200 Woolworths gift card. But when the company announced it had partnered with News Corp Australia to create Thanks a Million, it created a backlash on social media. Perhaps it was bad timing, coming as it did on the same day as Kevin Rudd\u2019s petition for a royal commission into Rupert Murdoch\u2019s influence in Australia clocked up 500,000 signatures by the time it closed on Wednesday at midnight. The chief executive of Woolworths Group, Brad Banducci, and News Corp CEO Michael Miller got together for a photoshoot to promote the campaign but it didn\u2019t win Woolies any praise. On Thursday the company\u2019s social media team was busy trying to calm the angry responses by explaining over and over that: \u201cAfter the challenging year Australia has faced, we\u2019re keen to say thanks to everyone who has made a difference.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
