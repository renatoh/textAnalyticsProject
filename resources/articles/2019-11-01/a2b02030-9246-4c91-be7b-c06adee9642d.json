Under pressure due to a record season of early bushfires and the accusation by a coalition of former fire chiefs that the government has avoided the issue of climate change, Morrison said on Thursday there was no \u201ccredible scientific evidence\u201d that cutting Australia\u2019s emissions could reduce the severity of bushfires. On Thursday Morrison defended the government\u2019s handling of the bushfire season, telling ABC\u2019s AM it had put additional resources into emergency services and praising the \u201coutstanding\u201d response and coordination of state governments. Morrison said he \u201ctook issue\u201d with the suggestion by Greg Mullins, the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue, and 23 other fire chiefs that the government was not adequately prepared. Explaining why he didn\u2019t meet Mullins, Morrison said the government already had the same advice about the impact of climate change from \u201cexisting fire chiefs doing the existing job\u201d. At first, Morrison appeared to accept that climate change was affecting the severity and frequency of bushfires. \u201cThese are things that are very well known to the government \u2013 the contribution of these issues to global weather conditions and to conditions here in Australia are known and acknowledged,\u201d he said. \u201cIn February I acknowledged the contribution of those factors to what was happening in Australia \u2013 amongst many other issues.\u201d Morrison then said \u201cthe suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accountable for 1.3% of the world\u2019s emissions, that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it\u2019s here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn\u2019t bear up to credible scientific evidence either\u201d. \u201cClimate change is a global phenomenon and we\u2019re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change \u2013 we\u2019re taking action on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think to suggest that at just 1.3% of emissions, that Australia doing something more or less would change the fire outcome this season \u2013 I don\u2019t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.\u201d The comments follow a controversy in September when the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, said he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow if climate change is manmade\u201d, before a total about-face. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Australia\u2019s response to climate change has been ranked one of the worst in the G20, with rising greenhouse gas emissions since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. Australia\u2019s target of 26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030 will require it to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade. The Morrison government said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, would come from carryover credits from overperformance of earlier targets and not from practical emissions reduction. The centrepiece of federal climate policy is the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as the climate solutions fund, a reverse auction processes that pays landowners and businesses to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The government has been quietly pursuing an overhaul of the emissions reduction fund, appointing a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it, and will consider the issue with the states at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. On Thursday Morrison refused to give further details of his proposed crackdown on environmental protests and secondary boycotts, saying the government would make announcements when it had \u201cfinalised those arrangements\u201d. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has suggested measures could include extending the prohibition on secondary boycotts to environmental campaigns, and a crackdown on environmental litigation and use of litigation funders for class actions against mining companies. In a speech to the Business Council on Wednesday, Morrison flagged an overhaul of environmental approvals for major projects to reduce the length of time it takes for businesses to navigate environmental approvals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
