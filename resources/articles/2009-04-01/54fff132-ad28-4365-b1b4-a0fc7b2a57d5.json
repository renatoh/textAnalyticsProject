Ferguson did not further the spat yesterday, although neither did he back down on his complaint that Ben\u00edtez had gestured that Blackburn were beaten as soon as Liverpool scored their second goal last weekend. The overwhelming evidence from Anfield that day was that the Spaniard had merely gestured to Xabi Alonso over the free-kick routine that produced Fernando Torres' second goal. \"I made my point about it. I don't understand why he did it,\" he said. \"I don't want to go on about it anymore. I made my point. There is no point carrying it on. It's plain for everybody to see now. I have made my issue about it.\" As for Liverpool's explanation about the that Ben\u00edtez gesture, the Scot added: \"They are hurt by it. Lee launched a staunch defence of Benitez's character in his manager's absence and revealed how the now delicate topic of the gesture was not even raised by Allardyce when they had a drink after Rovers' 4-0 defeat. \"I think the whole thing is quite sad really, I really do,\" said Allardyce's successor as Bolton manager. \"We all knew what the gesture was about on the day. Any gestures that are made from the side of the pitch are only ever intended for our players only, no-one else. I was surprised by what was said. I had a drink with Sam after the match and nothing was said about it. We had a good working relationship so I am sure if he felt that strongly about it he would have said something to me.\" The Liverpool assistant manager added: \"This is not Britain's Got Talent; you don't win anything for being popular, but our manager is not arrogant. He is astute, learned, educated and his attention to detail is fantastic. We are all a bit sensitive to criticism but he knows what he is doing, why he is doing it and who he is gesticulating at!\" Liverpool will again be without their captain, Steven Gerrard, tonight as the midfielder recovers from the adductor strain he aggravated ahead of the Champions League quarter-final second leg against Chelsea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
