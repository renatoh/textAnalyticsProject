I met Evan Williams, chief executive of Pyra, back in January, and wrote about how he was a one-man band, holding together this wildly popular service with lots of late-night coding sessions, and little else. Eight months down the line from our meeting, and his world has changed radically. Having created a revenue stream - Blogger Pro - he's taken on four staff, is about to recrute another, and things are moving fast, as he explains in this post to one of his own blogs. It's a transformation worthy of the internet boom but, having spoken to Ev, and knowing Pyra's rocky history, I suspect the business plan is far more solid than many dot.coms of that era."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
