Here, more than 50 years ago, the teenaged Raymond Kopa served his apprenticeship before moving on to fame with Rheims, France and Real Madrid. And here, 20 years ago, G\u00e9rard Houllier made his first mark as a coach by leading little Noeux-les-Mines from the fifth to the second division of the French league, attracting crowds of 4,000 for games against Lille or Strasbourg. Today Noeux-les-Mines are back where they started, restored to their amateur status in the fifth division. A couple of Sundays ago the club's volunteer staff were preparing for a local derby against Bruay-la-Bussi\u00e8re. A couple of hours before the kick-off Francine, who has been serving behind the bar in the clubhouse since Houllier's day, was invited to estimate the size of the crowd. \"Une trentaine,\" she replied. About 30. Which, she added, is their average for the season. So passes the glory of sport, although it is still on view in the enlarged colour photograph of the second division team, with Houllier at their centre, mounted on the wall of the small office occupied by the present coach Henri Novak. And also in the black-and-white snaps, curling at the edges in a glass display case, which immortalise the Kopa era - including a team shot from 1948-49, captioned \" Champions du Nord \" , in which the young star is given his full name, Raymond Kopaszewski, and in which five of his team-mates also have Polish surnames, reflecting those of the fathers and grandfathers who left their native land in search of a more lucrative employment for their coalmining skills. Francine remembers Houllier well, and gave a sad little shake of her head when asked if he ever comes back to visit. \" Jamais. \" And Kopa, who now lives in retirement in Angers? \" Jamais. \" But good memories live on. \"Very good memories,\" G\u00e9rard Dhesse, the club's current president, said this week. \"When G\u00e9rard Houllier came here from Le Touquet he had very few resources compared with other clubs. But it was obvious straight away that he was a very serious and highly professional man, with a vision that was both broad and humanistic. He introduced a sense of rigour to the team, but he also participated in the culture of the town. And the other thing I remember is that he already loved English football, and Liverpool in particular.\" Perhaps one day the supporters of Liverpool will remember Houllier for re- introducing the concept of rigour to their team while participating in the culture of their city. In the meantime they are probably more likely to recognise an echo of another of Dhesse's memories, which is of Houllier's facult\u00e9 d'adaptation - his skill at carefully preparing his side to face a particular set of opponents. That is what he did last Saturday, sending Liverpool out with Steven Gerrard alongside Dietmar Hamann in midfield, sacrificing flair for strength in order to confront the challenge of Patrick Vieira. In the end, after he had brought the expressive abilities of Patrik Berger, Robbie Fowler and Gary McAllister into play in the second half, the strategy prevailed. Some will call it luck. Houllier calls it \"the game of 14\". He set out his theories on the practice of coaching in detail eight years ago in a book called Entraineur: Competence et Passion, co-written with Jacques Crevoisier, a sports psychologist. It remains a useful manual for coaches at any level, dealing mostly with the mental side of the job: \"when you've lost a match, that's when praise is important\", for instance, or \"the commando spirit can sometimes be useful in the short term for a certain kind of player, but it becomes dangerous over a longer period\". His media-friendly demeanour and his academic background have led some to question his toughness. They should consider how tough a coach needs to be in order to manipulate a squad including 20 senior international players, only 11 of whom can start a match. On a hot summer's day two years ago, in a friendly before his first full season in charge of Liverpool, Houllier said of his refusal to use his permitted complement of substitutes: \"It would have been easy to change five players, but I wanted them to suffer a bit.\" A bit of midsummer suffering is what prepares them for a season such as the one just ending, in which the team have played in every match available to them in four competitions, and in which no match has lacked competitive significance. Strangely, Houllier's handling of Michael Owen continues to draw criticism from those perhaps unaware of the coach's passionate expressions of faith in the young man's talent over the past 2 years. Houllier set up the widely envied national scheme for developing young players in his own country, and coached France - Henry, Anelka, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet and all - to victory in the European Under-18 championship in 1996, and probably no coach in the world has a more acute understanding of the need to regulate the pressure on young players in the context of the modern game's mental and physical intensity. Most particularly, he is aware that the fitness problems which afflicted Owen a couple of years ago were caused by the player's willingness as a teenager to accede to requests to play all the year round, every summer being given up to some sort of representative tournament. Not that the Frenchman's career has been totally without blemish. In a section dealing with motivation, his book advises: \"It is necessary to criticise the bad act without condemning its author.\" So one can imagine that he still wakes up at night regretting his notorious description of David Ginola as \"a criminal\" after a loose pass cost France qualification for the 1994 World Cup and Houllier his job as the national team's head coach. Although he remains as passionate about football, he would be unlikely to repeat the indiscretion today. Houllier's recipe for a good coach includes the following qualities: \"Realism, self-confidence, boldness, involvement, consistency, the ability to listen, an aptitude for making decisions, the capacity for leadership, and recognised competence\". Of these, boldness is one for which Liverpool's more exigent fans are still awaiting evidence, having endured performances - notably those against Roma at Anfield and Barcelona in the Nou Camp in the Uefa Cup, and against Birmingham City in the League Cup final - in which the team seemed to take the field in a less than wholly adventurous frame of mind. \"The players are responsible for the game, but the weight of the result is for the coach to bear,\" Houllier wrote eight years ago. And the sum of his own hard-won experience, good and bad, all the way from Noeux-les-Mines to Anfield, is behind his success in making Liverpool hard to beat again. Tonight in Dortmund, when they face Alaves in the Uefa Cup final, we may hope to learn a little more about his ability to take the next step and mould the successors to St John and Yeats, Keegan and Smith, Dalglish and Hansen into an expressive force once more. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
