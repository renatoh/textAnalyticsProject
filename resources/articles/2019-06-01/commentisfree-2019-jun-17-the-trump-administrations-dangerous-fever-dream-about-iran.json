In the wake of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman \u2013 which the US blames on Iran, though questions remain about the attack \u2013 the discourse on Iran being pushed by the administration and others is reaching fever pitch. Senator Tom Cotton has called for a \u201cretaliatory military strike\u201d. The New York Times columnist Bret Stephens says the US should threaten to sink Iran\u2019s navy. This, of course, is not surprising to anyone who has watched the Iran debate in Washington. It\u2019s divorced from reality. Everyone knows that Iran\u2019s government is dangerous. It represses the Iranian people. It sponsors terrorism across the Middle East. The question is not whether Iran is bad \u2013 the question is what the best strategy is to deal with the threats. During the end of George W Bush\u2019s administration and Barack Obama\u2019s terms, the priority was stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear program. After years of a carefully coordinated global sanctions campaign, the Obama administration secured a deal that stopped Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency and even the Trump administration certified that the deal was working. Before, during and after the deal, the US has countered Iranian terrorism and bolstered Israel\u2019s defenses. None of it has been good enough for those trapped in the fever dream. The fever dream convinces policymakers to cozy up to regimes from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates that are themselves awful. It rationalizes support for a devastating war in Yemen. It causes the state department to fund, until recently, a group that attacked journalists and experts for not being anti-Iran. Locked in the fever dream\u2019s grips for years, John Bolton in 2015 called for bombing Iran. All of this is in lieu of a realistic set of goals or a strategy for actually achieving them. It\u2019s a fever dream, and only those with the fever seem to be able to make sense of the dream. US allies from Europe to Asia are frustrated with how much sway the fever dream has over US policy; they wonder what could possibly drive the US to abandon such a successful deal. It reminds one of the absurdity and recklessness of those who talked about bombing North Korea in 2017 \u2013 which could have started a nuclear war \u2013 and how completely they ignored the catastrophic consequences. Most worrying, it reminds one of the run-up to the war in Iraq in 2003 \u2013 how the Bush administration lied about Iraq\u2019s possession of WMD and links to terrorism, and how Americans were told the invasion would be a \u201ccakewalk\u201d and that America would be greeted as a liberator. Reports of a rare, recent high-level meeting on Iran at the CIA before the latest round of warnings over Iran should concern those who remember the politicization of intelligence before the Iraq war. The result of it all is a heightened risk of conflict. And though the Trump administration claims it does not want war, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reportedly said that the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) \u2013 passed in order to fight those involved in 9/11 \u2013 could authorize a war with Iran (which the AUMF does not). America needs to have a real conversation about Iran. We need to make clear that Iran is not ten feet tall. We can\u2019t let the fever dream drive US policy in the Middle East. Israel has the region\u2019s strongest military, and with continued US support it can defend itself. America will continue to counter Iranian-sponsored terrorism. America does not need to blindly support countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the name of countering Iran. These governments repress their own people, stoke regional conflicts and have funded terrorism and radical indoctrination abroad. When the United States partners with Saudi Arabia by supporting a war in Yemen \u2013 supposedly to counter Iran \u2013 that creates a humanitarian disaster, America has lost sight of its interests. To develop an effective strategy, America needs to put itself in Iran\u2019s shoes. After the US invaded two of Iran\u2019s neighbors \u2013 Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 tensions got even worse with Iran\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear weapon and deadly fights between Iranians and American soldiers in Iraq. America believes Iran\u2019s aggression has intensified while Iran believes America is surrounding Iran. Lost in the fever dream is the need for a dialogue with Tehran. A strategy of pressure alongside dialogue produced the nuclear deal. The US should talk to Iran about the future of Afghanistan and Iraq. And there is a broader dialogue to be had \u2013 alongside pressure \u2013 about regional security. Iran could do more to push a crisis to the brink as well. With Trump ripping up the nuclear deal, Iran is saying it will enrich uranium beyond the limits of the nuclear deal. If it was responsible for the oil tanker attack, more destabilizing acts could follow. That could lead to a vicious cycle that raises the chances of war. We need to wake up from the fever dream and have a real debate about Iran, develop a real strategy for Iran and start a real dialogue with Iran.
