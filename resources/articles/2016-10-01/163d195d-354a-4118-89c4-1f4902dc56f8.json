David Whiteley, the chief executive of Industry Super Australia, said the report from the Grattan Institute, released earlier this week, contained numerous \u201cstatistical sins\u201d that rendered its conclusions misleading. He said basic statistical errors \u2013 such as averaging between rich and poor, young and old, employees and self-employed \u2013 allowed the Grattan Institute to present a picture of household wealth that bore \u201clittle relationship to reality\u201d. The institute\u2019s claim that superannuation savings accounted for only a small portion \u2013 about 15% \u2013 of the wealth of most Australian households was simply not true, he said. And policymakers should not heed to the paper\u2019s recommendation to freeze the compulsory super rate at 9.5%. \u201cThe Grattan Institute [has] made some very worthwhile contributions to public policy debates, but on this occasion [it has] made an error,\u201d Whiteley said. \u201c[Its] analysis and conclusions are flawed and, if adopted, risk leaving the majority of the workforce, who don\u2019t have extensive property and share portfolios, without enough income to top up the basic age pension. \u201cThe effect of [its] statistical sins inflate the apparent assets of low- and middle-income earners who we know have very little in the way of financial assets other than super and are especially reliant on the super guarantee to deliver income over and above the age pension. \u201cWithout super most Australians would be entering retirement with virtually no other savings.\u201d The Grattan Institute\u2019s paper, How Households Save for Retirement, was released on Sunday. John Daley, the institute\u2019s chief executive, used the paper to call for a radical rethink of superannuation policy, saying super savings were not as significant for retirement as Australians had been led to believe. His analysis showed super was actually the least important part of Australia\u2019s retirement income system, because the average Australian saved as much outside as inside the super system. This had huge implications for retirement income policy, and meant the compulsory super guarantee should not be lifted from 9.5% to 12%, as is legislated. \u201cThere are powerful vested interests pushing the idea that super equals retirement savings,\u201d Daley said. \u201cYet such a view is inconsistent with the facts. Super\u2019s importance to retirement savings has been overblown for far too long.\u201d When asked about Industry Super\u2019s criticism, Daley said it had missed the point of his report. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who have a lot of money outside of super, and therefore we should be doing the policy analysis taking that into account,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the crux of our argument. \u201cA lot of the analysis that is done to find out if people are saving enough for retirement is done precisely on the averages, in terms of peoples\u2019 total super savings, and it blithely ignores the fact that there\u2019s a whole bunch of people, employed and self-employed, who have a disproportionately large quantity of non-super savings.\u201d Daley did not include owner-occupied housing in his analysis, despite Industry Super\u2019s claim. He also said he split his analysis by age group, and by income, rather than averaging across age groups as Industry Super claimed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
