You have struck a rock.\" Yesterday, thousands of South African women who marked the 50th anniversary of that historic anti-apartheid march by re-enacting it, received a far warmer reception at South Africa's administrative headquarters than that given in 1956. The original march was staged to protest against pass laws, which separated families and restricted the movement of black people. Then, the Union Buildings were the citadel of Afrikaner rule, and JG Strijdom - arguably the most vicious of apartheid's rulers - was in power. Yesterday it was Thabo Mbeki who received the marchers, telling them: \"Together as a nation we must uphold the perspective that none of us is free unless the women of our country are free. Free from racial and gender discrimination, free from poverty, free from fear and violence.\" The president has increased the participation of women in his government - his deputy president is a woman, as are 12 of his 28 ministers. But Mr Mbeki and other speakers emphasised that even though apartheid is history, South African women had to continue their struggle against poverty, Aids and the world's highest rates of rape, domestic violence and murder against females. Sophie Williams de Bruyn, 68, one of the organisers of the 1956 march, spoke about the threats women face. \"This is not what we struggled for - raping of babies, rampant poverty, trafficking of children and so many ugly things. What we must do is keep pushing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
