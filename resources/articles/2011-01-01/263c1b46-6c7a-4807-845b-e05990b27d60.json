Villa have failed with two offers for the 25-year-old but it is a measure of their determination to sign the Scotland international that they are preparing a third bid that promises to test Blackpool's resolve. Ian Holloway, the Blackpool manager, has suggested that Adam should be setting his sights higher than joining Villa. John Carew, meanwhile, has almost certainly played his last game for Villa. Carew, who joined Villa from Lyon four years ago, is expected to complete a move to another Premier League club before the end of the week. Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion have both been linked with Carew, although it is understood that the Norwegian's preference would be to join a London club. Stephen Warnock looks set to follow Carew out of Villa Park. Warnock is desperate to revive his career after failing to make the substitutes' bench in Villa's last four matches and being made to train with the reserves. Liverpool retain an interest in re\u2011signing the left-back, who started his career at Anfield before moving to Blackburn Rovers, but there has been no progress on a loan deal until the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
