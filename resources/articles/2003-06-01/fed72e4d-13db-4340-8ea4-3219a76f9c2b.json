Yet looking at the errors, follies and abuses perpetuated in the name of the market since the collapse of communist eastern Europe, you begin to wonder. Enron, Arthur Andersen, AOL-Time Warner, Marconi, Lucent, the Wall Street investment banks, the dotcoms... these are supposed to be adverts for rationality, efficient markets and the evident superiority of the market system. The ironical truth is that those who believe most fervently in markets - businessmen, consultants and the business press - are their most unreliable guides. They argue vociferously that the best markets are the freest, that they are powered by greed and self-interest, that the role of the state should be minimal, that success is the result of brilliant design and that regulation automatically damages 'competitiveness' and costs jobs. Yet these beliefs are false, as are the strategies based on them, with the results seen only too clearly in the corporate catastrophes mentioned above. Capitalists, you might say, are capitalism's worst enemy - and particularly the market fundamentalist tendency which has been in the ascendant for the last 20 years. John Kay calls this the American Business Model, or ABM for short, and the perverse consequences of its delusional account of economic reality are one of the principal threads of his provocative new book The Truth About Markets: Their Genius, Their Limits, Their Follies (Allen Lane The Penguin Press, \u00a325). Kay says he wrote the book to counter the crass oversimplifications of market fundamentalists since the end of the Cold War. Their precepts are both unattractive and untrue, he says. In poor countries they have done fearful damage, holding back development; while in rich ones 'the assertion that greed is not only our dominant economic motivation but even an admirable value has not led to universal prosperity but to corporate theft and corruption'. Markets work, Kay notes, through 'disciplined pluralism' - a process of endless trial and error which leads to con stant but unpredictable small-scale incremental improvements. These in turn provoke evolutionary adaptations in the surrounding social and institutional framework. Successful markets are inseparable from the supporting context in which they are embedded; truly free markets are countries such as Nigeria, Haiti and post-Cold-War Russia which are poor, chaotic and venal. The only rich country to have deliberately applied the ABM is New Zealand, which after a decade and a half of outstandingly poor performance has abandoned it in favour of more moderate policies. Companies aren't markets (that's the point), but to survive and evolve they too need to work through 'disciplined pluralism' - management by delegation and accountability - rather than central diktat. Centralised bureaucratic firms and state enterprises are the last refuge of the planned economy and stagnate and decay for the same reasons, not to do with ownership but lack of adaptive experimentation. It is the invisible, not the visible hand that makes the market work: countless small interactions, not the big bet, which is almost bound to be wrong, whether in public or private sector. 'We don't have and never could have the precise knowledge to maximise shareholder value in a scientific way,' says Kay. This helps to explain why instrumental motivations are often self-defeating - profit-oriented companies aren't necessarily the most profitable, because delusions about the way markets work induce them to act in ways that defeat their own long-term interests. In the name of shareholder value, they cut costs, slash R&amp;D or make large 'strategic' acquisitions, all of which halt evolutionary experiment in its tracks and wreck the co-operative, team-based behaviour that supports it. Markets - and company success - are about developing little stories, not grand narratives. 'It's hard to find many companies which have gained enduring advantage as a result of a grand vision,' he says. Grand corporate visions are like governments trying to pick winners. And those that are half right can play out as badly as those that are 100 per cent wrong. For example, AOL and Time-Warner were right to foresee convergence of internet content and delivery: providers need content and vice versa. But they were wrong to bank on the merger being the one best way to achieve the finished article. Similarly, ATT correctly saw that telephones and computers would come together, but buying a second-ranking computer company was a disastrous way of trying to force convergence into one particular channel. Other disfigurements of capitalism derive from similar misconceptions about markets. The obscenity of so much executive pay is nothing to do with the market. If there were a market in top executives, companies wouldn't need remuneration committees and consultants to tell them what to pay. Instead, it's based on the delusion of design - the idea that successful companies are or even can be the product of a mind that can foresee all eventualities and deliberately plan for them. Instead, a company like GE is the product of countless interactions between countless actors down the years. No one 'designed' today's GE, not even its series of legendary chief executives, although Jack Welch appeared to have succumbed to that belief by the end of his tenure. Kay's inquiry, developed through a large number of 'little stories' ranging from Van Gogh and Picasso to the San Remo flower market, is a welcome antidote to the one-dimensional, reductionist accounts of the business world produced by followers and fellow-travellers of the ABM. With Adair Turner's Just Capital and our own Will Hutton's The World We're In, Kay's book provides another justification and foundation stone for trying different, less arrogant ways of running our companies and working life. The truth about markets is that there are alternatives, after all. simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
