This Hulu big-budget vehicle, mainly driven by George Clooney, who co-produces, co-stars and also directs a couple of the (six) episodes, succeeds with something approaching magnificence, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if there\u2019s any \u201cunadaptable\u201d classic that telly can\u2019t manage in this, its new golden age. The writers have done a fine job not just of pacing but of condensing Heller\u2019s tricksy timeline into an all-too-credible arc, and also of shepherding the action perfectly between barrack-room lunacies and, actually, seriously exciting CGI\u2019d aerial sequences. I\u2019m not sure whether it was a great idea for Clooney to appear himself, least of all as such an odious character as Lieutenant (later General) Scheisskopf, boorish stickler and cuckold, and the nearest that either book or series comes to cliche. But there are few men who won\u2019t appear even better in the just-so khaki pants and subtle collar stars and tucked ties of the USAAF of the 40s and 50s and so, good-looking boy though George certainly is, maybe he just couldn\u2019t resist the uniform. But it\u2019s Christopher Abbott who really excels. John \u201cYo-Yo\u201d Yossarian is an everyman, yes, but with a difference \u2013 he\u2019s got attitude to spare, and cojones, and a certain surliness \u2013 and Abbott plays him with a streak of fun. There\u2019s one relatively early exchange when, after basic training and shipping to the Italian island of Pianosa, there to load his B-52 for further pointless bombing raids (the Germans having already fled Rome), Yossarian confides to a colleague: \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed. I\u2019m afraid.\u201d And that, in hindsight, says it all. This is all about someone who\u2019s quite at ease in his own skin yet, strangely enough, just doesn\u2019t want to suddenly die. As the sorties are ramped up, against all logic and sometimes for petty revenge, there becomes an increasingly noxious contrast between life and death. It can be no coincidence that the \u201clife\u201d part is such a good life: the bomber boys stripping off and jumping off Italian cliffs in impossible sunshine, or sauntering through Rome with young lives before them; and then the sudden jump-cut to Yo-Yo in the bomb bay of his aircraft, black blooms of flak all around, his thoughts vaguely on just glimpsed targets and sweating hands, on the pettifogging bureaucracy and bluster back at base, the random illogic and arbitrary bombing lines. And we, too, feel the fear and sigh a heartfelt nervous shudder when we see him back on the beach, knowing it\u2019s got to come again. Half anti-war paean, half mighty roar against gung-ho lying idiocy, it\u2019s as powerful as it was all those years ago. And genuinely, if pathetically, funny in its mightier moments. What a storm of a six weeks it\u2019s been in Years and Years, which drew to a bravura end after way too short a time \u2013 I could have watched it for weeks and weeks. Not, bizarrely it turns out, for everyone: some souls shuddered at its very believability, at a time of fractious futures for us all, while other stauncher viewers railed against what they saw as preachy PC tub-thumping. I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t get either, being perhaps lousy at nuance or wary of being too easily \u201ctriggered\u201d: I just loved watching a quite phenomenal drama. Russell T Davies had his messages, undoubtedly, but all these, and all the wildly inventive futurisms, both technical and political, took a back seat \u2013 always \u2013 to the tale of the Lyons family, as doughty and angry and loving a batch as you could hope to meet in any current or future crisis. So many slivers of earlier episodes still live with me. That subtle unnoticed clenched hand gesture of Gran towards Celeste: grudging love but love nonetheless. Danny\u2019s gleeful sense of life. The sisters\u2019 wicked bawdy giggles. The wider picture was terrific, of course, and Viv Rook (Emma Thompson) has been starkly instructive in the magnetism of populism \u2013 one found oneself nodding along at \u201ccommon sense\u201d, until recoiling at the squalor of its logical end \u2013 but, at its heart, just that one family, acting their talented socks off. Rory Kinnear, Anne Reid, T\u2019Nia Miller \u2026 I\u2019ll miss you all. Davies has said there are no plans for a follow-up but, as a simple salute to his talent, even if he\u2019d never done anything else in his life, this would stand majestic. While C4\u2019s relatively grownup Sunday-night thing had nothing more to contend with than vainglorious macho quarter-truths, the BBC\u2019s Our Next Prime Minister on Tuesday surely cements the old suspicion that the Beeb really, really hates Tories. What, actually, were they thinking? This was cruel and unusual punishment. Even for five men with so little shame that they\u2019re willing to be elected as \u201cour\u201d PM by the demographic equivalent of an old folks\u2019 home in Mallard Dullard newly high on rightwing crack, in order to further careen their way through the ruination of political trust ever, Tuesday night was bad. Those seats were ghastly nasty. Never mind \u201cmanspreading\u201d; they are quite impossible to sit on without looking anything other than a savagely uncool tit\u2026 not even Clooney could have pulled that one off. It was as if Emily Maitlis were trying to interview a batch of children sent to the naughty seat. As ever, one writhed naughtily to slide off. Maitlis struggled gamely. But black mark, BBC: we\u2019re not a jot further forward with \u201cthe\u201d, or indeed any, Brexit argument but, worse, you almost made me feel sorry for them. Yet anyone who doubted the huge import of the outcome \u2013 and there are many who, worn down to the point of screaming apathy, just want to elect a pig\u2019s bladder on a stick and be done with it \u2013 need look no further than Italy, where deputy PM Matteo Salvini, widely seen as the most powerful force behind the new right, has now threatened to withdraw protection from Roberto Saviano, the investigative essayist under sanction of death from the Camorra. Salvini\u2019s hint feels like little more than a death threat. Saviano\u2019s greatest work, of course, is Gomorrah, which tells nothing less than the current true story of the mafia or Camorra, currently curling its talons into the highest reaches of, um, government. It\u2019s more popular in Italy than Game of Thrones, and burst back on our screens with sprays of blood, and mood, and prosaic details. Savagely and urgently credible, it is also, sadly, terribly good television."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
