'Nine years of frozen prices is crazy,' he informs his own paper's media correspondent. So crazy, indeed, that things 'cannot go on as they were'. Thus, the cover price of the Independent on Sunday goes up to \u00a31.40, followed swiftly by the daily itself, moving from 55p to 60p. Reality bites. But who's getting bitten? On the one hand, Fallon thinks 75p a reasonable mid-term target for the Indy (while Jeremy Deedes, his Telegraph oppo, rather fancies 95p, the same as a coffee at his railway buffet). But, on the other hand, broadsheet sales are catching a nasty cold. The Daily Telegraph was down 7.5 per cent year-on-year in April, and the Times a crunching 10.41 per cent. Even the Independent, with fewer copies left to lose, still drooped after piling on more (giveaway) bulks and foreign copies. Putting up prices in a falling market doesn't make solid business sense anywhere in the world: not in South Africa, from whence Fallon has lately returned; not in Ireland, where his bosses live; not in Canary Wharf. Yet the case for such increases is dutifully echoed all around Fleet Street. The whole of the serious market is getting a bit uppity again. Prevailing wisdom (targeting Murdoch circa 1993) holds that price wars - like the one Rupert started via the Times - were a terrible mistake. They cheapened reputations; they deluded readers; they got the supposedly ideal revenue ratio between ad revenue and cover price revenue (55:45) way out of true; they scattered the seeds of financial gloom the moment advertising boom turned to bust. Now, conveniently enough, such imbalances must be rectified. Ratcheting up the price you charge is somehow virtuous, a benign course correction. Better yet, if the product is right, you may feel no pain in the process. Quality and sanctimony are their own rewards. It seems sad to cough in this cathedral of common sense - sad, but inevitable. For the thesis itself, not to mention its outcome, is self-evident bunk. Look at pagination booming away, says Fallon: many more page bangs for your buck. Size matters. And price does, too. You don't always feel the impact the moment the figure below the masthead changes. Newspapers usually add temporary part-works, roll out bargain offers, puff their wares on TV. Sometimes, for a week or three, they can sell more and charge more at the same time. Come back later, however, and euphoria has turned to dust. Why is the FT so disastrously down year-on-year in Britain (from 161,850 to 135,504 copies a day)? Partly because of the City's doldrums, to be sure: but also because it costs \u00a31 a day. The Telegraph, in spite of its fall, is still pumping out 308,697 cut-price subscription copies each morning. One sixth of the Times' circulation is sustained that way. Of course price matters. Which daily tabloid caught the biggest cold in April? The Mirror , down 8.51 per cent in a year. April was the month when the new management there scrapped price-cutting on more than half-a-million copies - while the Sun, up 5.2 per cent, carried on cutting away, driving its greatest rival ever closer to the edge, and the Star rose still higher (up 27.2 per cent) as the most consistent cheap buy on the news-stand. Why - whisper it gently - is the 35p Daily Express at last displaying a trace of momentum month-on-month while the 40p Mail (yes, the Mail !) slips back? Overall and over time, putting one rise together with another, price rises take the zip out of markets, depress demand, turn blue balance sheets an ominous grey. They aren't an easy option. In the end, if the policy goes heedless or haywire, pain ripples through the whole industry pay. Look, for instance, at the readership statistics for 1999, when Murdoch's price freeze still largely held. Then 73 per cent of Guardian readers read the Guardian alone. Comparative solus figures for the Independent stood at 60 per cent; for the Times 71 per cent; for the Telegraph 81 per cent. Now consider the same solus category for the end of 2002. Three years on, a consistent trend; 78 per cent take the Guardian alone, 75 per cent the Times, 84 per cent the Telegraph, 63 per cent the Independent . What's happened as the price rises have chipped in? Easy. People who used to read two papers have cut down to one. They've gone with a click of their purse. Loyal readers of the main title may, indeed, put quality or tradition over price; but down below, in the wider marketplace, disloyal readers are flaking away. Thus a rise on the Telegraph may blight the Times (and the 180,000 or so who used to take both titles). Thus the FT - which shares 27 per cent of its readers with the Times - is vulnerable when choices have to be made. Many a ripple makes an almighty muckle. The rapidity and steepness of the rises counts, too. That's why the Times (which seemed to cost 20p or 30p only the other day) suffers at 45p, 10 pence shy of the Telegraph. That's why Fallon may be unpleasantly surprised by what happens on the Indy . That is perhaps one reason why the Guardian - which didn't price cut in the first place - is relatively stable. Too cheap is a pretty facile cheep-cheep of a rallying cry: and it isn't internationally true, either. The New York Times is a dollar. The Corriere de la Sera and La Stampa are 90 cents. Figaro and El Pais are \u20ac1. These, give or take the odd fluctuation, are all in-the-ballpark figures. And the European titles, moreover, carry a slice of VAT with those charges. It may be inevitable as advertising flags. It may be simply unavoidable to tug the lever marked 'price'. But nobody - least of all Deedes or Fallon - should kid themselves. The 'right' price is what Conrad Black needs to keep his executive jets flying. The 'wrong' price - for the Indy or Heinz baked beans - is what's left on the shelf."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
