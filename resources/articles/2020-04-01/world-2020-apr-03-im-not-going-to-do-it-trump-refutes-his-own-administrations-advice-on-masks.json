The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance for people to wear bandannas, t-shirts and other cloth-based coverings in crowded areas, especially in hot spots. \u201cThe CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,\u201d the US president told reporters on Friday. \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d Yet later on Friday evening, first lady Melania Trump tweeted: \u201cAs the weekend approaches I ask that everyone take social distancing &amp; wearing a mask/face covering seriously.\u201d At the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was pressed to explain his unwillingness to lead by example and offered a characteristically unconventional reply. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself. They say \u2018recommendation\u2019, they recommend it. I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d \u2013 a remark that ignored evidence that many virus carriers do not show symptoms. He went on: \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be doing \u2013 somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d The guidance on face covering has shifted over time. Previously only the sick or those at high risk of complications from the virus were advised to wear masks. Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, tweeted at the end of February that people should \u201cSTOP BUYING MASKS\u201d and said they were not effective in protecting the general public. On Friday, Adams admitted the evolution of the guidance on masks \u201chas been confusing to the American people\u201d. He said the original advice was based on the best information available at the time and that the World Health Organization recommended against using them. But now, Adams said, it is known that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of people with the virus lack symptoms and can transmit it before they show symptoms, for example by coughing, sneezing or speaking. \u201cIn light of this new evidence, CDC recommends, and the task force recommends, wearing cloth-based coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies.\u201d At Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump was not accompanied by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spoke at the podium on Thursday about his growing role in the supply chain. Kushner, who has no medical qualifications, raised eyebrows by claiming that states should use their own equipment stockpiles first, adding: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Hours later, the administration suddenly changed the description of the strategic national stockpile on government websites, switching the emphasis from it being the country\u2019s biggest supply for use in a public health emergency to it supplementing state and local supplies. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well,\u201d it now says. At the briefing, Trump was challenged by Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent of CBS News, over Kushner\u2019s use of the word \u201cour\u201d. He dismissed it as a \u201cgotcha\u201d question, responding: \u201cIt means the United States of America. And then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states. We need it for the government and we need it for the federal government ... \u201cAs an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We\u2019re gonna bring them to various areas of the country that need them. When he says \u2018our\u2019 he\u2019s talking about our country. He\u2019s talking about the federal government.\u201d Increasingly riled as he sought to defend a family member, Trump told Jiang, a woman of colour: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s such a basic, simple question and you try to make it sound so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself ... You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.\u201d The tension between federal and state governments in the distribution of ventilators, masks, gloves and other equipment has been a defining feature of the incoherent US response to the virus. Trump reeled off numbers of supplies Washington is sending to states, including 8.1m masks to New York, which has been hardest hit. But Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, tweeted on Friday: \u201cWe do not have enough ventilators. Period.\u201d Pressed on whether he can assure New Yorkers that they will have a sufficient quantity, Trump said bluntly: \u201cNo. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators at the time. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators, They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do \u2013 we are doing our best for New York. \u201cYou know, we have states, we have a lot of states \u2013 we have territories too \u2013 but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of. Some much more so than others. We happen to think he\u2019s well-served with ventilators. We\u2019re gonna find out.\u201d Whereas Fauci has called for a nationwide state-at-home order, Trump continues to argue that the main responsibility lies with the states. \u201cI leave it up to the governors,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI like that from the standpoint of governing.\u201d Critics say the administration was caught napping by the pandemic and has mobilised the buying and manufacturing of equipment way too late. But Trump took a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, complaining: \u201cThe previous administration, the shelves were empty.\u201d As Trump also continues to attack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and massive job losses leave people uninsured, there are growing concerns over access to health care for millions. But the White House said on Friday it would cover the costs of coronavirus treatment for uninsured people, drawing on $100bn set aside in the emergency rescue package passed by Congress last week. Friday\u2019s briefing also produced a very Trumpian moment as he referred to the models projecting the virus\u2019s spread and death toll. He said: \u201cThe models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come way under the model. The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model \u2013 at least, this kind of a model.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
