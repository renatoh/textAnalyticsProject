A woman who was subjected to a potentially illegal strip-search as a 15-year-old has described it as an \u201cintimidating\u201d and \u201ctraumatic\u201d experience. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that police in New South Wales have strip-searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds, in the past three years. The shocking figures come as the state\u2019s police watchdog investigates the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018 and have led to calls from the Redfern Legal Centre \u2013 which first obtained the data \u2013 for a ban on strip-searching minors unless a court order is obtained.

Recommended reads Martin Scorsese\u2019s the Irishman won\u2019t be coming to a cinema near you, writes Stephanie Convery. \u201cIf there was ever a sign that cinema-going was becoming a niche experience, it must be that a major feature directed by one of the godfathers of modern film will grace only a handful of big screens around the world. Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, a crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, is not the first likely blockbuster to bypass wide theatrical release before heading to the binge-box of home entertainment, but it is perhaps the most notable.\u201d Would you let an AI rephrase the tone of your emails? asks Aleksandra Bliszczyk. \u201cYou install the artificial intelligence-powered plugin on to your web browser, where it scans your emails and grades them as \u2018confident\u2019, \u2018optimistic\u2019, \u2018worried\u2019 or \u2018sceptical\u2019 \u2013 it claims to identify 40 tones.

It feels neat and familiar, but the software raises a broader question than the one it asked its users: to what standard are our interactions being steered?\u201d Listen On Today in Focus, Tom Phillips joins the search for some of the thousands of people who have gone missing or been murdered in Mexico\u2019s bloody drug wars.

Media roundup The Australian reports that Karl Stefanovic will return to the Today show next year, \u201cif he is willing to take a major pay cut\u201d.
