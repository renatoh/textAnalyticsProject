Holders Girondins Bordeaux were one of only a handful of top flight clubs to make it to the second round. PSG sank to an embarrassing 3-2 defeat at home to Nantes. The Parisians, whose under-fire coach Luis Fernandez was boosted by a 2-0 league win against Lyon last week, were undone by two headers from Nantes defender Mario Yepes. The Colombian scored in each half from crosses by Olivier Quint, with defender Sylvain Armand grabbing Nantes' other goal from a brilliant counter-attack in the 34th minute. PSG had managed to fight their way back from two goals down thanks to Alex Nyarko in the 42nd minute and Argentine Gabriel Heinze four minutes into the second half. But having fallen behind again to Armand's second strike, Brazilian star Ronaldinho missed a decisive penalty with 10 minutes remaining, ruining PSG's hopes of going into extra-time. \"I knew where he would kick it. I had the right inspiration,\" said Nantes goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, who also saved a penalty in his team's recent 1-0 victory at PSG's Parc des Princes in a First Division match. First Division leaders Nice were beaten by Second Division Creteil 1-0 while RC Lens, Sedan and Rennes were also beaten by teams from lower divisions. Nice, who have taken the First Division by storm this season after narrowly escaping relegation to the Third Division on financial grounds, were unable to tame their hosts at Creteil. Captain Sebastien Dallet scored Creteil's goal from close range in the 65th minute to hand Nice only their third defeat of the season. To add to their woes, veteran midfielder Eric Roy was denied a last-gasp goal by the referee after team-mate Kaba Diawara had handled before making the decisive pass. Second Division St Etienne beat Le Havre 1-0 in extra-time thanks to a goal scored by Frederic Mendy in the 114th minute. Monaco scored their third successive victory against Auxerre, with in-form Ludovic Giuly scoring the only goal in the game. RC Lens, Sedan and Stade Rennes all bowed out to lower division sides after penalty shootouts. Rennes were ousted at Second Division Gueugnon, who won 5-4 after a 1-1 draw at the end of extra-time to revive memories of two seasons ago when the Burgundy side beat PSG in the same manner to win the competition. Lens squandered a 3-1 lead at Second Division Beauvais, who levelled thanks to a brace from striker Julien Poueys and went on to win 3-1 on penalties. Sedan, the only other home team to have beaten Nice this season, were humbled 4-2 on penalties at Third DivisionNimes after sharing two goals over 120 minutes. Five other top-flight teams were ousted by fellow First Division opponents, the most impressive victory coming from Olympique Marseille, who thrashed Troyes 5-1 at home thanks to a hat-trick by the Ivory Coast's Ibrahima Bakayoko. Peguy Luyindula scored Olympique Lyon's goals as the French champions beat Bastia 2-0 at home. Holders Girondins Bordeaux fought back to win 2-1 at Montpellier thanks to goals in the last 15 minutes by Brazil's Savio and Portugal's Pedro Pauleta with a penalty. Sochaux beat AC Ajaccio 3-0 at home, striker Michael Isabey scoring twice, while in another all-First Division clash En Avant Guingampovercame Racing Strasbourg 1-0 thanks to veteran Argentine defender Nestor Fabbri. Germany: Die Bundesliga Three days after knocking holders Schalke 04 out of the German Cup, Bayern Munich are marching on towards an 18th league crown, moving eight points clear at the top with a comfortable 3-0 away win at Stuttgart. The visitors had shown little threat until Alexander Zickler gave them the lead with a diving header from a cross by fellow striker Elber in the 29th minute. Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz doubled the advantage from inside the area four minutes later before sealing the victory with a superb volley from the edge of the box on 68 minutes. Substitute striker Marcio Amoroso was the match winner with two second-half goals for Borussia Dortmund at home to Kaiserslautern. The 3-1 victory sees the German champions climb one place to second, ahead of Werder Bremen on goal difference but eight points behind league leaders Bayern. Dortmund went ahead when Kaiserslautern defender Tomasz Klos deflected a shot from playmaker Tomas Rosicky into his own net in the 22nd minute. Kaiserslautern responded two minutes later with a goal from close range by Portugal midfielder Jose Manuel Dominguez. Rosicky rattled the bar with a penalty just before half-time. Amoroso then came on to win the game for Dortmund and leave their crisis-hit visitors second from bottom of the table. Meanwhile Dortmund have added their name to the growing list of clubs chasing Kaiserslautern and Germany striker Miroslav Klose, who looks likely to leave the crisis-hit club in the near future. Klose, 24, is contracted until 2005 but the four-times German champions are likely to let him go earlier because they need money to avoid financial collapse. Kaiserslautern, who are being investigated by the German tax authorities after alleged irregularities by the club's former management, could even have to let Klose go during the Bundesliga break which starts this weekend. \"If such a player is on the market, we would be stupid if we had no interest,\" Dortmund's commercial manager Michael Meier told today's Bild newspaper. Dortmund will find themselves in competition with Bayern Munich for the Germany striker's signature, however, as well as Hertha Berlin and several other top European clubs. \"If we can have such a player, then we should get him,\" said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. Werder Bremen, who had won their last three matches, had to be content with a draw at Schalke that saw them drop one spot to third. The visitors had a great start, taking the lead from a long-range effort by striker Markus Daun on just three minutes. But Schalke, whose coach Frank Neubarth played for Werder for nearly two decades, levelled five minutes later with a strike from close range by captain Ebbe Sand. Bayer Leverkusen suggested they could lift themselves up the table with a spirited performance against a TSV Munich side who had not lost at home since August. Former TSV striker Daniel Bierfoka showed Leverkusen the way by scoring from close range on nine minutes. Substitute forward Dimitar Berbatov added another from close range in the 51st minute before Germany forward Oliver Neuville wrapped up a 3-0 win with seconds remaining. Artur Wichniarek, who scored twice in Arminia Bielefeld's 2-2 draw with Bayer Leverkusen in their last home game, underlined his brilliant form with another double against Hansa Rostock. The Poland striker gave Arminia the lead just before the break and then collected a fine through ball from fellow striker Mamadou Diabang to double the lead on 55 minutes. Rostock lost Sweden defender Andreas Jakobsson for a second booking four minutes later, before defender Bastian Reinhardt inflicted further punishment on the northerners 10 minutes from time. Hamburg had a 1-0 home victory in sight when VfL Bochum striker Peter Graulund hit the equaliser with just three seconds remaining before stoppage time. Bosnia midfielder Sergej Barbarez gave Hamburg the lead on 56 minutes before being sent off 12 minutes later for a second booking. Bochum midfielder and captain Dariusz Wosz was substituted after 21 minutes with suspected damaged knee ligaments. Slovakia midfielder Igor Demo scored his fourth goal in as many games with the only goal in the 15th minute, helping once-mighty Borussia Moenchengladbach move up to 13th with a 1-0 victory over Hanover 96. Fellow strugglers Hanover, last season's Second Division champions, remain third from bottom after their fourth straight defeat. Hertha Berlin relinquished a 2-0 lead over VFL Wolfsburg in front of their home fans in a poor game played in freezing conditions. Croatia defender Josip Simunic headed home from a corner for Hertha's first goal in the 24th minute. Belgium midfielder Bart Goor increased their lead two minutes into the second half. However the visitors pulled one back with a header from striker Robson Ponte in the 63rd minute, before defender Kim Madsen drew them level from close range in the dying moments. There was a 2-2 draw between Nuremberg and Energie Cottbus as the visiting team fought bravely with 10 men to snatch a draw with a goal from striker Lars Jungnickel four minutes from time. Despite their efforts they remain bottom of the table. Poland midfielder Radoslaw Kaluzny headed Cottbus ahead in the 15th minute. Nuremberg fought back with a goal from the edge of the box by Czech defender Marek Nikl three minutes from the break before Yugoslavia defender Dusa Petkovic put them in the lead from the penalty spot in the 52nd minute. Cottbus played the last 30 minutes without midfielder Timo Rost, who was sent off for a second booking.
