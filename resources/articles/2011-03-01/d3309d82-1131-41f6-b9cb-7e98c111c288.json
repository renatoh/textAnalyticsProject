A first home league defeat in 17 years by Warrington was bad enough but to be so comprehensively outplayed by Harlequins underlines the scale of the problems at the club as they struggle to readjust following the retirement of their stalwart hooker Keiron Cunningham and the demolition of their equally inspirational Knowsley Road home. That is not to be disrespectful to Super League's southern upstarts, who had already beaten Leeds at Headingley and who now have four wins from five matches to confirm that their good start under the previously unknown young coach Rob Powell was no fluke. Quins are joint top with Warrington, who won 22-6 at Wakefield last night. But a Saints team including eight internationals should not trail 20-0 at half-time to anyone, as they did here. They looked bereft of organisation, with the absence through injury of Leon Pryce and Jon Wilkin denying Kyle Eastmond the support he so badly needs in these difficult dying days of his career with the club. Instead Eastmond was left to pull the strings with the young stand-off Lee Gaskell and all the signs are that after allowing the speculation over his move to rugby union to drag on for so long before it was finally confirmed, 10 days ago, the scrum-half no longer has confidence in himself or from his team-mates. \"Our attitude wasn't good enough,\" said the Saints coach, Royce Simmons, refusing to single out individuals or to blame the change of venue. \"I've got no doubt that everyone would like to be at Knowsley Road, but the case is we're not and we've got to get our heads around that. We've all got to have a long hard think.\" The warning signs were flashing within three minutes, as Harlequins opened the scoring with a clinical try. Luke Dorn, such a busy and lively full-back, steamed on to Rob Purdham's inside pass and left his opposite number, Paul Wellens, floundering by cutting inside to the posts. Then a handling error by Gaskell gave Quins another chance, from which Karl Pryce surged over on the left. Luke Gale curled over a tricky conversion to make it 12-0 inside six minutes. Even on a rare occasion when Saints clicked, Harlequins coped admirably. Mark Calderwood, the former England wing who was making his first senior appearance, made a try-saving tackle on Francis Meli. Another error by the unfortunate Gaskell then conceded the position for the powerful England centre Tony Clubb to bounce out of a tackle and struggle over with several defenders clinging on. St Helens were denied the first-half try they needed when Gaskell's short pass to Scott Moore was ruled forward, and instead Gale extended the Quins lead to 20-0 with a penalty conceded by James Graham that symbolised the growing frustration inside the stadium. There was a hint of a fight-back eight minutes into the second half, when a break by Wellens created the momentum for Meli to cross in the corner from Gaskell's floated pass. When Graham struggled over from close range and Eastmond converted, the deficit was down to 20-10 and the \"home\" supporters attempted a first chorus of \"Oh when the Saints\". But within four minutes the stadium was deathly quiet again, bar the throaty chants of the handful of Quins diehards who had travelled north, as Nick Kouparitsas, a former Sydney Roosters forward who had been introduced from the interchange bench, intercepted an ill-advised pass by the usually reliable James Roby and galloped 40 metres for the killer try. The game fizzled out after that, with Saints' inability to launch the sort of stirring late rally in which they specialised at Knowsley Road offering further evidence of their malaise. Gale popped over a late drop goal to add further suffering to those of the shocking 6,050 attendance who remained, and a last-gasp try for the persevering Roby was irrelevant.
