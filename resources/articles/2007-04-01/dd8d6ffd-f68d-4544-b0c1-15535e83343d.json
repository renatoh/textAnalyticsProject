The day may be immaterial to a non-believer, but to any lover of English churches Holy Week has drenched their architecture in terror and faith down the centuries, depicted in roods, screens, sepulchres and sanctuaries. But why East Coker? The answer is that it was here that TS Eliot chose to evoke, in the second of his Four Quartets, not just the gloom of the Good Friday season but his vision of mystical misery for all humankind. Were Eliot not a devout Anglican we might think him the bleakest of atheists on the strength of this poem. What did the village do to him, that he should use it to evoke such nihilism? Eliot's ashes are buried in East Coker. He discovered that his Elyot ancestors went from here to America in the 1660s and one served on the jury at the Salem witch trials. The family eventually migrated to Missouri, where Eliot himself was born in St Louis. He had no other attachment to the place. In the late-1930s he cycled over when staying with friends nearby and on his last visit in 1939 took some photographs, but did not return before his death in 1965. The village was to Eliot rather an idea, a metaphor to put to poetic use, an idyll of England at the start of the second world war. To an expatriate it was also soil, roots, something to which, however much he ignored it, he should dutifully return. \"In my beginning is my end,\" he began the poem and ended it, \"in my end is my beginning\". This faintly oriental paradox leaves Eliot pilgrims scratching their heads before stomping off to the Helyar Arms down the road. Most churches celebrated in verse can wear the badge with delight. Stoke Poges has Thomas Gray's \"homely joys and destiny obscure\", telling \"the short and simple annals of the poor\". Grantchester has Rupert Brooke's \"yet stands the church clock at ten to three? / And is there honey still for tea?\" Half England's churches can boast something by Betjeman and almost as many quote a snatch of Larkin. Eliot himself blessed Little Gidding, elsewhere in the Four Quartets, as \"the intersection of the timeless moment\" where \"all shall be well, and / all manner of things shall be well [...] and the fire and the rose are one.\" But East Coker gets a frigid stare, as if Eliot could not forgive it for having created Eliots in the first place. There is no evocation of happiness, rather of Good Friday eclipse. \"Now the light falls / Across the open field, leaving the deep lane / Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon.\" Daylight is \"absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.\" (In reality Coker's stone is golden and famously refractive.) Then there are the clod-hopping villagers, Brueghelesque peons still speaking in an Elizabethan tongue. \"If you do not come too close, / On a summer midnight, you can hear the music / Of the weak pipe and the little drum / And see them dancing around the bonfire, / The association of man and woman / In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie [...] Earth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth ...\" Eliot seems to regard East Coker as the embodiment of personal as well as collective despair. He refers to his 20 years as a poet as \"largely wasted\" and leaving him \"still with the intolerable wrestle / With words and meanings.\" Every attempt \"is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure,\" because he has \"only learnt to get the better of words / For the thing one no longer has to say [...]\". Nothing is to be learned from experience. Our \"quiet-voiced elders\" have deceived us. \"Do not let me hear / Of the wisdom of old men but rather of their folly.\" The one wisdom we can hope to acquire \"is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless. / The houses are all gone under the sea.\" As for Eliot's contemporaries, the captains of industry, the merchants, men of letters, civil servants, chairmen of committees, he lists them all but removes them from the lanes and fields of Somerset and places them in an Underground train that has stopped too long between stations, where \"cold the sense and lost the motive of action\". What have they to say, he asks, this Good Friday? \"They all go into the dark, the vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant ... and you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen, Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about.\" Eliot's Good Friday in East Coker is a place of wounded surgeons, dying nurses and \"The whole earth is our hospital / Endowed by the ruined millionaire\". Even if we recover we shall still \"die of the absolute paternal care / That will not leave us\". Hence on this day, \"The dripping blood our only drink, / The bloody flesh our only food: In spite of which we like to think / That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood - / Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.\" There are passages in the poem which some critics regard as tingeing the narcissistic gloom with a mildly religious discipline. They are indeed among Eliot's most powerful lines. \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope / For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without / love/ For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith / But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the / waiting./ Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought [...] The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry, / The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy/ Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony/ Of death and birth.\" But even here it is hard to see anything but a soul in torment. Eliot is like some Somerset Puritan hurling down hellfire on the wretches who have just staggered in from the fields, only to be assured of damnation. It is small consolation that the same damnation awaits the banker in the Tube and this austere poet with a paradox complex. \"Where you are is where you are not.\" All this seems unfair on East Coker. This week its sun shone, its thatch was new, its lambs frisky, its blossom fresh. Here the southern tip of England's great limestone scar peters out round the rolling flanks of Ham Hill, whose stone is the colour of biscuit sprinkled with gold, able to trap sunlight in day and release it at dusk. Ham is the loveliest stone in England, rendering the Somerset/Dorset borders a magic place hovering at the end of the rainbow. The rainbow touches in particular the walls of East Coker. The church is a jolly place. Its quaint arcades do not match, one with 12th-century piers, the other perpendicular and panelled. The wagon roof is ceiled and the bosses brightly painted. Trees wave through clear glass windows. This is no place for Eliot's grim poem. East Coker should wear a perpetual smile on its face. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
