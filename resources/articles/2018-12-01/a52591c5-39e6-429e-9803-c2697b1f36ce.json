Mattis resigned this week but Trump brought forward his departure, piqued by a resignation letter which was strongly if implicitly critical of the president, particularly over his treatment of US allies, and which attracted favourable media coverage. The deputy defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, will take over as acting secretary. On Monday morning, Trump tweeted that Mattis \u201cdid not see as a problem\u201d one of the president\u2019s bugbears: the cost of alliances with countries which supposedly \u201ctake total advantage of\u201d American taxpayers. He also attacked the US envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State, Brett McGurk, who also resigned. Mattis\u2019s removal came amid a government shutdown and as the Washington Post and New York Times published reports on a White House in meltdown. Trump was depicted calling advisers \u201cfucking idiots\u201d and complaining that so much of Washington and the media is against him, he faces \u201ca war every day\u201d. Trump now needs a new face to run America\u2019s everyday wars. Mattis and McGurk resigned after the president abruptly decided to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria, seemingly at the behest of Turkey, which is openly hostile to America\u2019s Kurdish allies. News of a planned withdrawal of half the 14,000 troops in Afghanistan followed. In keeping with dismissals including that of the former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, Trump did not give Mattis the news. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, notified him, an anonymous official told the Associated Press. The sudden change stripped Mattis of any chance to smooth relations with rattled allies. Domestically, White House staff sought to limit the damage, one official telling the AP Trump simply decided to avoid a drawn-out transition. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told ABC the president and Mattis \u201cdid not share some of the same philosophies\u201d. Evidence for the claim was readily available. In September, Trump told CBS Mattis was \u201csort of a Democrat\u201d, adding: \u201cBut General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave.\u201d On Saturday, Trump tweeted: \u201cWhen President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn\u2019t, I thought I should. Interesting relationship.\u201d Regarding Mattis\u2019s criticism, the president added: \u201cAllies are very important \u2013 but not when they take advantage of US.\u201d Mulvaney said the president and Mattis \u201cjust could never get on the same page\u201d on Syria, and added that Trump had said since his campaign that \u201che wanted to get out\u201d. The president, Mulvaney said, was \u201centitled to have a secretary of defense committed to that same end\u201d. Mattis was widely seen as one of Trump\u2019s last \u201cadults in the room\u201d, able to resist the president\u2019s wilder impulses, as reported by Bob Woodward in his book Fear. Mattis denied saying Trump had the understanding of a child or blocking a mooted assassination of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Fear remains a bestseller. Mulvaney said he had \u201cencouraged [Trump] to find people who have some overlap with him but don\u2019t see the world in lockstep with him.\u201d Shanahan was a senior vice-president at Boeing when he became Pentagon deputy in July 2017. A White House official said Trump wants to focus on streamlining purchases, on which Shanahan has been working. During a lunch with conservatives on Saturday, Trump discussed a replacement. They were \u201cnot all military\u201d, said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a military veteran and foreign policy hawk whose name crops up on lists of possible defense picks. Another hawkish senator and veteran, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, is also regularly mentioned. However, Trump\u2019s Syria decision prompted Republican opposition. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, urged him to reconsider \u201ca premature and costly mistake\u201d while on Sunday Bob Corker, chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, told CNN he was \u201csaddened for our country\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m saddened for the broken relationships with countries that have been with us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saddened for the many Kurds and others who will likely be killed and slaughtered by either the Syrians or the Turks. I\u2019m saddened for our country in being so unreliable.\u201d Trump answered on Monday, on Twitter: \u201cWe are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the US, and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!\u201d He also claimed McGurk, who on Saturday he said he did not know, \u201cwas the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with $1.8bn in CASH &amp; sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker\u201d. Trump regularly repeats inaccurate claims about payments to Iran. According to the website Politifact, the $1.8bn figure is a slight exaggeration of a transfer that covered an order for military equipment made before the 1979 revolution and thus never fulfilled. The attack on McGurk echoed remarks by Mulvaney and other aides. He was appointed as Isis envoy by Barack Obama in 2015 but his first senior jobs as a diplomat, on Iran and Iraq, were under George W Bush. Senators asked Trump to withhold a final decision on Syria for 90 days. But on Monday the Pentagon confirmed that Mattis had signed the withdrawal order. No operational details were provided. On Sunday, Trump tweeted: \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of Isis in Syria \u2026 and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right \u2018next door\u2019. Our troops are coming home!\u201d In Syria, Turkish troops were reported to be concentrating near Manbij, a town held by Kurdish fighters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
