The first assertion of the strongly worded Boe Declaration says all Pacific nations, including Australia, \u201creaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific, and our commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris agreement. \u201cLeaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and \u2026 called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their \u2026 mitigation targets, including through the development and transfer of renewable energy, in line with committed timeframes.\u201d Leaders of the Forum Islands countries also called for the US to return to the Paris agreement and the commitments it made under President Barack Obama. The Boe Declaration said the security challenges being faced by Pacific nations were broader and more complex than in previous generations. The forum committed its members to addressing humanitarian assistance, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity. Australia will work with regional security agencies to establish a Pacific Fusion Centre to better share intelligence and target threats including illegal fishing, drug trafficking and other cross-border crimes. But the forthright declaration on climate is awkward politically for Australia, with its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, apparently at odds with his own government\u2019s Energy Security Board over whether Australia will meet its Paris targets of a 26% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels. The government does not have any emissions reductions policies in place to achieve the target. Morrison told a radio program on Wednesday that \u201cthe business-as-usual model gets us there [meeting the Paris targets] in a canter\u201d. But the Energy Security Board said business as usual \u2013 and a failure to implement the now-discarded national energy guarantee \u2013 would mean the electricity sector would \u201cfall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels\u201d. The Australian government\u2019s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours. As a region, the Pacific has produced the least carbon of any areaon Earth but its citizens have felt the impacts of climate change first, and most acutely, through rising seas, increased salinity, and more frequent and severe natural disasters. Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the plant to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested. Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, told the Guardian Australia\u2019s relationship with the Pacific was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change. \u201cAustralia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they\u2019re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed \u2026 But then on a regional basis they\u2019ve actually given a lot of support to our region,\u201d Matsutaro said. \u201cSometimes the way I think about it ... it\u2019s like you\u2019re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.\u201d In a blistering speech in Sydney last month, Samoa\u2019s prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele, called climate change an \u201cexistential threat ... for all our Pacific family\u201d and said any world leader who denied climate change\u2019s existence was \u201cutterly stupid\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
