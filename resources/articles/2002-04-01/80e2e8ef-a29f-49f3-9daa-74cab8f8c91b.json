A little of it can go a long way. For this performance in the Barbican's Only Connect series, Armstrong deployed an army of supporting personnel to lend depth and colour to his compositions: the London Sinfonietta contributed rich orchestral textures, with support from the Metro Voices choir, while a series of guest vocalists lent some much-needed personality to proceedings. Armstrong's list of credits demonstrates that whatever he's got, lots of people want some of it, including Madonna, Bj\u00f6rk, Massive Attack and film-maker Baz Luhrmann. Left to its own devices, however, his music tends to lapse into a doleful MOR-minimalism, with only a slowly ticking beat to alleviate the synchronised weeping of violins. Offering few surprises and little in the way of harmonic development, it suffers from that familiar new-music trait of appearing to travel without ever arriving. It may be that Armstrong was made for soundtrack work, where the music derives context and meaning from the action on the screen. Thank heavens, therefore, for his singers. The first half was beginning to resemble a prairie of gloom, albeit lit up by a few grand drums-and-orchestra climaxes, when Evan Dando came gangling out from the wings. The former Lemonhead has a voice both dark and resonant, and it cut across Armstrong's baleful music for Wake Up in New York with welcome authority. Dando was replaced by Swati Natekar for Miracle, where her carefully calibrated tonality contrasted effectively with Armstrong's densely banked strings. Luckily, David McAlmont only featured in two songs in the second half: otherwise the evening might have turned into the David McAlmont show featuring Craig Armstrong. His rendition of One Day I'll Fly Away (as used in Moulin Rouge) was flamboyantly camp and made more so by the exertions of the choir. His performance of Snow was more measured but, in its way, equally commanding. The other guests were less colourful, though Antye Greie Fuchs, armed with a laptop, offered a stone-faced study in information-age dislocation on Waltz."}, "isHosted": false}}}
