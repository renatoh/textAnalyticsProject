Divine intervention was, of course, unnecessary as he duly took the title to stand alone behind only Michael Schumacher as the most successful driver in history. Hamilton has comprehensively proved this season that he owes nothing to fortune or chance but rather is a man performing on a level apart from other mortals. Hamilton would dearly have liked to seal his sixth title with a win but second place proved more than enough and followed, appropriately, a fiercely determined drive at the Circuit of the Americas that summed up why the championship was his and deservedly so. It had been Ferrari who appeared to have the car to beat, yet they foundered and, as they desperately pursued answers to where their pace had gone, Hamilton and Mercedes made hay. With the enthusiasm of a rookie and the control of a master the 34-year-old proceeded to wring the neck of the season. This was perhaps one of his greatest displays \u2013 as intimidating as Tiger Woods at his peak and with that overwhelming sense of an unstoppable force displayed by Australia\u2019s cricket side of 1999-2007. These comparisons are not made lightly. Hamilton took eight wins from the opening 12 races of the season. Only two of those eight were from pole. He has exploited every opportunity and crucially been consistently quicker when it matters on race day. Equally, while putting in repeatedly flawless performances, he has also shown a resilience in recovering after setbacks, thereby indicating an athlete operating on a fearsome mental plane. His teammate, Valtteri Bottas, in identical machinery won only twice in the same period. Hamilton celebrated the title in Austin but it was surely won in the five meetings from the French to the Hungarian grands prix. At Paul Ricard he was unmatched, winning by 18 seconds from Bottas. Then in Austria with Mercedes struggling he ensured the points kept coming with a fifth. At Silverstone he took advantage of a one-stop strategy to claim a victory that had looked unlikely. Hockenheim in contrast was the low point. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes chief, described it as \u201carmageddon\u201d. In wet conditions Hamilton and the team made errors and ninth place was almost humiliating. What followed was both redemption and a reminder there was no blow from which Hamilton could not come back. At Hungary with Red Bull looking the class of the field, Hamilton went wheel to wheel with Max Verstappen until switching to new tyres looking for a decisive advantage. Hamilton was 20 seconds behind with 20 laps remaining as he scythed though the field before taking the lead and the flag. These were three of his best wins, astride his two worst finishes and by the time he had victory at the Hungaroring only mechanical failure or repeated driver error was going to stop him and the latter was unthinkable. In his 13th year in the sport he is the only F1 driver to have scored at least one victory in every season in which he has competed. Since 2014, a period during which Mercedes have often, but not always, had the best car, Hamilton has been without doubt their best driver. He has scored at least 10 wins a year in all but one of those six seasons. In 2016 when Nico Rosberg pipped him to the title Hamilton still won 10 races. In 2017, when Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari were resurgent, nine was enough to claim the championship. With the title, Hamilton ensured Mercedes have their sixth consecutive drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship double. It is a remarkable achievement, with the team unbeaten in either championship since the turbo-hybrid era began and having maintained their dominance through two major regulation changes. The record surpasses the run of five Ferrari scored between 2000 and 2004 with Schumacher. Ross Brawn, the technical director at Ferrari during that period and now F1\u2019s sporting director, recently said Hamilton was \u201crewriting the history of this sport in a manner all his own\u201d. It is clear he is very singularly doing so and in a manner as fascinating off track as he is formidable on it. In June Wolff, appreciative of the heights his driver was reaching, considered Hamilton would one day be recognised as \u201cthe greatest driver on the planet\u201d. A seventh title is more than achievable and Wolff believes Hamilton could shatter Schumacher\u2019s record. On his form this season that culminated in the crown in Austin, he is without doubt on course to do so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
