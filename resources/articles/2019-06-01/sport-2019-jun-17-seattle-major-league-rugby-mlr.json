It took a last-minute try to do it, in front of more than 5,000 fans. The game was a thriller, four tries to two shown live by CBS, a fitting end to a second season which brought rewards as well as challenges. Before the game, MLR commissioner Dean Howes said: \u201cIt was our sophomore year and we grew a little bit, and that\u2019s an atypical thing in the world of sports. Your second year is usually kind of a tough year, and I think we grew and I think we\u2019re poised to build.\u201d MLR began in 2018 with seven teams then added Toronto Arrows and Rugby United New York. Both made the playoffs. In 2020 the league will welcome the New England Free Jacks, Old Glory DC and Rugby ATL. The first two have played games in Boston and Washington; Atlanta are starting to sign up players. \u201cI think Boston and DC had some really shining moments on the games they put on,\u201d Howes said, \u201cAtlanta\u2019s going to put some on in a little while. So I think they\u2019ll jump in and be equal to anybody. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a young enough league that a coach and good player selection and a good system can make a huge difference.\u201d As much as a reference to work done by head coach Richie Walker and player-coach Phil Mack in Seattle, where the enormous MLS Shield will remain on its reinforced shelf, that could have been a nod to Atlanta, where James Walker and Paul Holmes are quietly signing college products. True to their brash home city, New York have been more noisy, signing the England full-back Ben Foden and last week unveiling a big name for season two, Mathieu Bastareaud, 54 caps and 300lbs of French international centre. \u201cThis is sports in United States,\u201d Howes said. \u201cNew York is New York. It gets the attention because quite frankly it deserves it. \u201cNow that said, I think James [Kennedy, RUNY owner] has been very proactive, to build on that. And so it\u2019s kind of the icing on the cake that you have an owner there that is making a lot of things happen.\u201d Speaking in a hotel bar on Lexington after making Bastareaud happen, Kennedy put a New York spin on things when he said, \u201cI think for the league the season was a success, but for me it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t win the final.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019ll see that the expectations are much higher now, because you\u2019ll see the amount of head coaches that are going to be replaced in the off-season.\u201d Kennedy indicated an imponderable of any league \u2013 the question of money, who has it and who doesn\u2019t \u2013 when he responded to a Rugby Today report which said he had run out of cash. \u201cWe are very well financed,\u201d he said, \u201cand have been entertaining investment offers for the last year and a half.\u201d \u2018One team\u2019s problem is all of our problems\u2019 MLR is indeed an investment opportunity, for players, coaches and those who hold the capital. Which means it carries risk. RUNY have French funds and a glittering market but struggled to attract crowds out to Coney Island. Kennedy said games will be played elsewhere next year. That San Diego hosted Seattle in the final was fitting not just in that they were the top two teams on the regular-season table. Both also play in smart stadiums, Torero and Starfire, which they have managed to fill. The Houston Sabercats have followed the Glendale Raptors in building their own home but the Austin Elite, like RUNY, found themselves playing in an echoing ballpark. Unlike RUNY, the Texans finished winless. There have been changes, former US Eagle Todd Clever becoming director of rugby. But unlike the Utah Warriors, once precariously placed too, Austin do not seem to have stabilised. There are rumours the operation could move to Ohio, which hosted a team in PRO, the predecessor to MLR. \u201cThis is a single entity,\u201d Howes said, referring to the MLR ownership structure. \u201cSo one team\u2019s problem is all of our problems. So we definitely have a ways to go but this is not atypical, right? I mean this is something every league goes through and I think it\u2019s better if they go through it with partners around them than if they were in a franchise model and things were a little different. \u201cThe league is involved with everybody, and we still have to improve some of our groups, and help them, and get them in a situation where they can succeed. That\u2019s why we spend a certain amount of time visiting with the city officials and because some of this is public-private help. It\u2019s finding the right facility, it\u2019s getting the right coaches. This is a complex heavy lift, and we want to work together to solve it.\u201d James English, RUNY\u2019s general manager, called their season \u201ca roller coaster and a learning curve\u201d. But he also confirmed that Foden would be back for 2020, to join Bastareaud in working with Americans new to the professional life. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to kind of go into the foreign player well a little bit deeper than we did [last year],\u201d Howes said, before a finale that showed strong South African influence. \u201cBut predominantly we are still a domestic league, which is our goal. And I think the domestic players have done a great job, augmented a little bit by the programs that we have going on [to import players from] Uruguay, and next year we\u2019ll have an Ireland programme and we\u2019ve got a few French players too. \u201cWe want to build up our domestic teams, our players, and our national team. But at the same time we feel one of the important things is that we have some international players to try to teach our players. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that the speed and the games I think are far better this year, even though we had to go deeper in talent pool.\u201d Some around the league say the bottom of that pool will be hit before kick-off in February. With 12 teams in two conferences, three in the east will be newly scrapping for talent. Around the oval world, players with passports may not lack for options. Back in the hotel bar in New York, Kennedy decided to tantalise. \u201cYou look at next year,\u201d he said, \u201cafter the World Cup, and you wonder... I\u2019m hearing rumors about a lot of All Blacks coming in.\u201d It\u2019s not an outrageous suggestion: Mils Muliaina packed up his 100 All Black caps and played in PRO, as did the big prop Jamie Mackintosh, who admittedly wore the silver fern 99 times fewer. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking to any,\u201d Kennedy added, smiling. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll see a lot of talent come in. Hopefully it will spread across the league.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
