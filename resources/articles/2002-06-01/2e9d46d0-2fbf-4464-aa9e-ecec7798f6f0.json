None more so than Suwon, just south of Seoul, which has carved a niche for itself with some unique sanitation facilities. Lavatories that have been designated Beautiful Toilets are even marked on the map ahead of major landmarks. Obviously a man with a clear idea of where the seat of affections truly rests, the mayor's belief was that \"if tourists feel comfortable in the toilet they will want to come back to Korea\". \u00b7 England's draw with Nigeria was so dull that fans found alternative entertainment by watching one of the stewards fall asleep on his feet before falling over.

A spokesperson for NTT DoCoMo blamed full-throttle use of the automatic redial button and announced that a recorded \"sold out\" message will greet callers looking to buy tickets for today's encounter between Japan and Tunisia, which should calm things down no end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
