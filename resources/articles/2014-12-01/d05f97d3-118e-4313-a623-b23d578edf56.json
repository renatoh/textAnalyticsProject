Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment (Grace) published the scathing 300-page report, which details the experiences of current and former students, employees, and others who have dealt with students\u2019 sex abuse claims \u2013such as pastors, counselors, and family members. The report, which BJU commissioned Grace to produce, said the findings \u201csupport a possible conclusion\u201d that childhood survivors of sex abuse may not consider the school a safe place to disclose such experiences or seek help. More than 60% of respondents who identified as victims characterized the \u201cgeneral attitude at BJU toward victims as one of blame and disparagement\u201d. BJU, which was founded in 1927 by Christian evangelist Robert Jones, has its students sign a \u201ccovenant\u201d to indicate their intention to abide by the university\u2019s policies, which include requiring that students abstain from premarital sex, strive towards a modest appearance, and be subject to curfews. In November 2012, BJU\u2019s board of trustees asked Grace to investigate the school in response to complaints about the its policies and procedures for handling abuse claims made by people abused while attending the school or earlier. It terminated the contract in late January, then reinstated it in late February. The investigation concluded in June, and Grace noted that it was an important step in improving how the school responds to sex abuse. The report was created by a team of Grace investigators, including mental health professionals with expertise in child abuse, child abuse prosecutors, and clergy members. The investigators created an online survey, then conducted 116 interviews, approximately half of which were with people who self-identified as victims of sexual abuse. The others interviewed were staff members, pastors, counselors, former students, and other people who have dealt with sex abuse claims made by students. BJU released a four-page summary of the report on Thursday. The university said it questioned some of the methodology of the report, but that the themes and recommendations it provides are ultimately valuable. \u201cBob Jones University is committed to making needed, substantive changes to better reflect our values and show victims the love of Jesus Christ. These changes will take deliberate thought and planning and time to implement. We ask for patience as we work with victims and other current and former students and take the necessary steps over the coming weeks, months, and years to achieve these goals.\u201d School president Steve Pettit is set to appoint a committee to review the report over the next few days. Because the school receives Title IX funding, it is required to report abuse claims under the Clery Act. The report, however, indicates that the university does not encourage individual reporting to the police. In Grace\u2019s survey, the 66 people who reported abuse were asked about the school\u2019s stance toward the victim making an abuse report. Of these, only five were encouraged to make a report. Fourteen participants described BJU as \u201cdiscouraging\u201d the report, and, most damningly, 17 participants stated that they were directed by BJU personnel not to make a police report. Four did not know and 26 defined the school\u2019s stance as \u201cother\u201d. These findings correlate with the messages that were presented on campus and at meetings such as the mandatory chapels students attended. One survey participant wrote: \u201cVictims heard, consistently, from chapel speakers and faculty/staff, that abusers should be forgiven, that they bore the sin of bitterness, and that they should not report abusers.\u201d While BJU officials have said they don\u2019t believe sex abuse can be justified, the report concluded that blaming and shaming messages found their way to students. One participant noted the use of Biblical language in shifting blame onto victims: \u201cIf a girl is raped she must have done something to provoke it. It was ALWAYS made to be the woman\u2019s fault. We were \u2018stumbling blocks\u2019 to the men.\u201d Grace also criticized the school\u2019s dress code, which it said sends an institutional message that victims could be responsible for the abuse they suffered. It said this does \u201cnot only exonerate perpetrators for their actions, but these messages also fail to demonstrate love and compassion to those who needed Christ more than ever.\u201d Grace also said that symptoms of trauma, or, in some cases, PTSD, were regarded as sinful behaviour. This was not limited to private counseling sessions between survivors of sexual abuse and school counselors; it was also characteristic of material taught in psychology classes. Some said they had left counseling sessions with school counselors feeling responsible and feeling as if they had been punished by God. One of these counselors, Dr Jim Berg, told investigators that the \u201crevivalist flavor\u201d of the school \u201cdoes create an eagerness to bring real solutions to a person. And so that is stronger in my mind than having to make sure that I am pacing myself at the same pace that they are going.\u201d \u201cMy situation was not this long, drawn-out relationship where people can unfold things. For one thing, I am a man, and secondly, my time is limited,\u201d Berg said. \u201cBut also my investigative manner \u2013 probably I jumped into things quicker and probably made someone uncomfortable.\u201d Grace issued a comprehensive list of recommendations for BJU, including offering a public apology, reviewing files of people who reported a criminal sexual offense to identify which disclosures must be reported to law enforcement, and offering tuition assistance to students who did not complete degrees after suffering trauma. Dani Kelley, a former BJU student who is a sex abuse survivor and a critic of the school, said she is not confident that the university could change its ways. She has never approached the school about her past abuse because of her concerns about how she would be treated. She is especially concerned about Grace\u2019s recommendation that the school contact victims. \u201cNot only would this require BJU reinserting themselves in the lives of those they hurt, I simply don\u2019t trust them to be humble, caring, compassionate, or repentant enough for such a meeting to do any good,\u201d Kelley told the Guardian in an email. \u201cThe language that BJU has used all along about this investigation and those it has hurt has been distancing and minimizing, including their pre-emptive response to the report that they published yesterday, in which they admitted that \u2018some\u2019 people may have \u2018felt\u2019 like they didn\u2019t receive the help they needed,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cThat sort of language and attitude does nothing to inspire confidence in the university\u2019s willingness to repair their mistakes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
