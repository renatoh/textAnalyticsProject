Not literally, of course - he doesn\u2019t live in my house. This isn\u2019t The Monkees, you know. Interpol are guests on episode 6, as are the Blasters, Sam Smith, Zola Jesus (not Zola Blood or Zola Budd, or indeed Emile Zola), and a band called U2, who apparently have a new album out? Anyone? No, me neither. Kofi Annan is on BBC2 to disprove the idea that - to paraphrase original \u201860s rocker Bill Shankly - rock\u2019n\u2019roll isn\u2019t a matter of life and death. It\u2019s more important than that. A measured response from this chap (enough about chaps for one blog). Ha, this is funny. A LOL moment, indeed. This viewer thought Labrinth smashed it, nailed it, went on a journey, a rollercoaster. Martin Ballantine was unimpressed. Blimey, that went fast. There was something Einsteinian about the freakish speed at which that half hour whizzed by. No, ZOOMED. Zoom, by Fat Larry\u2019s Band, 1982. Who\u2019s Zoomin\u2019 Who - that was an Aretha Franklin single from 1985. She\u2019s just done an album with Clive Davis - how do I know? Because I spoke to him today on the phone! Me and Clive, we\u2019re like that. No, but seriously - decent episode, that. What do YOU think, folks? And then it\u2019s lights out. Labrinth to close? Say wha\u2019?? He\u2019s doing one called Misbehavin\u2019. This has a robot voice and an electronic bass and you could be forgiven for guessing that it\u2019s from his first album but actually now he\u2019s started singing all gruff and R&amp;B style (\u201860s variety), that bassline is well Motown, the melody is like something Sam &amp; Dave might have bellowed into submission in 1965... It\u2019s electroid gospel R&amp;bass, or something. And it\u2019s got a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd on guitar. And this bit right now, this finger-popping cute bit, is great! Jools says they\u2019re extraordinary and wonderful. Nice voice - second best voice of the night after Rumer. Her sister is playing the lap - not anyone\u2019s lap, her own. She is patting and clicking all over the shop. I thought this was going to be rather more strange, exotic and esoteric, but it\u2019s pretty much conventional soulful piano balladry. Nice enough, though. Ah, now they appear to have reverted to a less familiar tongue. Very Jazz Cafe on a rainy Tuesday night. Sinead! From her new album! She\u2019s got a vicar\u2019s collar thingy on! She was ordained as a priest, right? Wasn\u2019t she? Is she still? She\u2019s singing about being taken to church. Not going to church - being taken. Suggests an element of resistance, not volition. I got a \u2018B\u2019 at GCSE in English Literature. She appears to be possessed by the ghosts of Sleater-Kinney. And she appears to have taken lessons in Scrawling On Your Hand from Chris Martin. Leather kecks and a priest\u2019s habit - good combo. One for 2015, fashion victims. This is Adam Cohen. Do he and Rufus and Sean Lennon and Jacob Dylan and the others meet up once a month to compare notes? This is all very serviceable and fine, if you like this sort of thing. I\u2019m still thinking about Holly in those chaps. And wondering now finally after 30 years whether Mark O\u2019Toole was a comedy alias. This is that Tube performance of Relax from back in the day. They ARE doing a song together! On Friday! (Memo to self: be out). Holly looks great! They\u2019re talking about the new album. I did not know he co-wrote a track with Vangelis. Did he really say that? I\u2019m casting back to Frankie on The Tube in 1983, wearing those chaps and chains. He actually doesn\u2019t look that different! Ah, Rumer. Doing the single. It\u2019s the Sound of Philadelphia meets La Carpenter. Divine strings, a voice that is all about melancholy and restraint, that doesn\u2019t screech for attention... what\u2019s not to like? I haven\u2019t seen the credits for this track, but given that she\u2019s worked with Burt Bacharach, I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to have co-written this with someone amazing from 1972. Was that man with the beard at the back of Rival Sons\u2019 stage really Kenny Gamble in a false beard? The Detroit Spinners could have had a hit with this right after I\u2019ll Be Around. I can\u2019t compliment any higher. Rival Sons, touted by People I Trust as Absolutely It when it comes to bluesy American rock. Elements of the Stripes, the Keys and KoL appear to be present and correct in their sonic, ahem, maelstrom. Am I right? You can see why Classic Rock put them on the cover - they\u2019re a new, updated variant on the original McCoy. He\u2019s a bit Vedder-esque, isn\u2019t he, that chap at the mic. Only a Vedder not allergic to pleasure. I think I just saw my rabbi shaking maracas at the back there. Labrinth shocks all-comers by assuming pole position! Now let\u2019s have a listen to this much-vaunted \u201870s soul direction. It\u2019s bluesy, fo\u2019 sho\u2019. Was blues a thing in the \u201870s? Hmm, not as far as I\u2019m told by older relatives. Certainly, though, this is a change of pace - what they use to call a volte face - from the chart popster. Then again, his record collection is vast and wide - how do I know? because he told me so - and he was never going to stand still for long. Although he is sitting still at that piano. The stabbing horns are a teensy bit \u201870s, I\u2019ll give him that. Interesting. Honestly this time. Give or take a Beeb trailer. It\u2019s so about to start, I can\u2019t even begin to tell you. Hope there\u2019s nothing as bloody or gruesome as the scene I\u2019m watching now on BBC2\u2019s Peaky Blinders, on Later... tonight. Will Jools wrestle Holly to the floor? Will Rumer poleaxe Sinead? Stay tuned. This gentleman sees Later... as the climax to a fun-packed day. Let\u2019s take the temperature of the Twittosphere, shall we? Labrinth is wondering who\u2019s going to be watching - there\u2019s confidence for you. Nyro? Laura Nyro. This is Laura Nyro. By the way, in case you were wondering, that Rumer album alluded to earlier, I am listening to now and it is the Karen Nyro amalgam of your dreams. Here is a journalist, blissing out to soft-soul/neo-\u201970s MOR. Did someone mention The Carpenters? Yes, I did. So while we\u2019re waiting for the action to start, let\u2019s languish a while in this lovely little number I just rustled up on YouTube. Here is the Later... wotsit thingum that they Tweet every week. Although do we know why it\u2019s on Thursday this week, not Tuesday? Am I being incredibly thick? Is it a football thing, or an apocalyptic disease thing? Here is that lineup photo on Twitter. There\u2019s a photo of tonight\u2019s lineup on Later...\u2019s Facebook page. But where\u2019s Holly? How can it not be? It does, after all, feature:- Sinead O\u2019Connor! Who will be performing a song - if not songs plural because she is probably, even after all these years, still The Marquee Name and so may well be opening and closing the show - from her latest album, I\u2019m Not Bossy, I\u2019m The Boss. Rumer! Who will be singing tracks from her upcoming third studio album Into Colour, including new song Dangerous, which by the way is a Karen Carpenter-goes-Philly soft-soul neo-classic. Labrinth! Who apparently has also adopted \u201ca more soulful 1970s sound\u201d on his upcoming second album Take Me to the Truth. Rival Sons! The Long Beach, California blues-rock young \u2018uns who graced the cover of Classic Rock earlier this year and got whatever the next level is beyond \u201crave\u201d reviews for their fourth album Great Western Valkyrie. Ibeyi! The French/Cuban twin daughters of famed Cuban percussionist Anga D\u00edaz, who was a member of Buena Vista Social Club. Adam Cohen! The son of Leonard will be playing a track from his fifth album We Go Home and dodging people like me who insist on calling him \u201cthe son of Leonard\u201d. Holly Johnson! The former Frankie Goes To Hollywood frontman will be chatting to Jools about his first new album in 15 years, 30 years after the release of Welcome To The Pleasuredome. They will then break into a roll-aht-ver-barrel rendition of Relax on the ol\u2019 joanna. All-tuhgever nah: \u201cRelax, don\u2019t do it, when you want to suck it to it-ah!\u201d (to be sung in a cockney accent positively slathered in jellied eels). Good evening!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
