A-Rod's situation is evolving, and we'll have full coverage of future developments. For now, please check additional coverage, which can be found here. Goodbye. This from the Detroit Tigers shortstop who was suspended earlier today for 50 games: In the spring of 2012 I made a terrible mistake that I deeply regret. I apologize to everyone that I have hurt as a result of my mistake, including my teammates, the Tigers organization, the great fans in Detroit, Major League Baseball, and my family. I take full responsibility for my actions, have no excuses for my lapse in judgement and I accept my suspension. I love the fans, my teammates and this organization and my greatest punishment is knowing that I have let so many good people down. I promise to do everything possible to try and earn back the respect that I have lost. I'm not saying that anyone is making anything up, I'm not saying about MLB or what's going on. I am saying we have a process, you have an opportunity to defend yourself, and I think the process, like all of us Americans, will have an opportunity to defend ourselves in a due process, and I think that's what we have today and I'll have my day. There's nothihg about it that's been easy, all of it has been challenging. I'm sure there have been mistakes made along the way, we;re here now, I'm a human being, I've had two hip surgeries I've had two knee surgeries, I'm fighting for my life, I have to defend myself. If I don't defend myself no one else will. I would tell them, please have some patience, let this process play out, and in due time we'll have an opportunity to reset. A-Rod on what he should tell fans who he asked to judge him from this point forward after admitting PED use in February of 2009. A-Rod was asked by a journalist why he would not just deny not using PED's if he didn't and A-Rod deflected again to telling all at a later point. I said what I said. That's Friday night, today is another day and I'm focused on what my job is and my responsibilities to the New York Yankees and fan base of New York. I do want to thank all the fans and some of the media people that are here today and my Dominican people and all the Hispanic's all over the world. The support I've gotten has been incredible, it's been the toughest fight of my life. By any means am I out of the woods, this is probably phase two just starting, it's not going to get easier it's probably going to get harder, but I am humbled and I am thankful for the support. A-Rod on being told MLBPA leader Michael Weiner said that A-Rod probably would not be happy with the comments he made on Friday in Trenton when he alluded to the Yankees and other parties trying to get out of his contract. I haven't gotten any indication on the timing of everything, I am so focused on tonight, you know it's been a long time for me, and the last time I was on the field it wasn't pretty against Detroit in the playoffs and against Baltimore and it was horrific. So I have a chance now to hit in the middle of the lineup, hopefully get some big hits and help this team enter the playoffs. A-Rod on his expectations of playing the rest of the season. I spoke with Cash last night...I mean yesterday afternoon, and we just talked about playing third base today, being back. He welcomed me back, and for me it's going to be business as usual. I've got a job to do, I have 24 teammates in there, we have a mission to enter the postseason, we have challenges ahead of us. But I think my focus is what can I do to help this team win, I'm trying to talk to all my teammates understand what's been happening here the last three or four months, kind of get in the groove as quick as I can and lead this team, help lead this offensive team to where we need to go. A-Rod after being asked about insinuating that the Yankees had been acting agaisnt him and clearing the air. We've seen everything...when the time is right we'll all speak more freely A-Rod on what material/evidence he has been presented with by MLB We'll have a forum to discuss all of that and we'll have a chance to talk about it then. A-Rod on whether or not he took PED's. Donning a Yankees hat and warm up uniform, A-Rod is addressing the press: ...the last seven months has been a nightmare, probably the worst time in my life for sure. Due to the circumstances at hand and a tough surgery and rehab program and being 38. I am thrilled and humbled to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to put on this uniform again and to play Major League baseball again. I feel like I was 18 years old back in Fenway park in 1994 when I went in to play the Red Sox for the very first time. I am very excited to have the opportunity to play baseball and help my team win and prove to myself, my teammates, the fans in New York, fans in baseball that I still have a shot to play baseball at a very high level. Michael Weiner, head of the MLBPA was on a conference call earlier, and according to Jon Heyman of MLB Network, Weiner mentioned October and November as a time period when the appeal process for Alex Rodriguez could wrap up. That's definitely more than the 45 days which seems like the normal protocol could be, but then again, is anything ever normal with A-Rod? The tarp is on the field right now, so the 810 PM EST start cannot be guaranteed right now. I think guys were happy to see him. He's a teammate of ours, he's a friend of ours, you heard a lot of guys laughing. Alex is one of the guys who has always sat around with the young players...for the players this is business as usual in a sense. There are things that happen when you're in New York some people are going to consider distractions, but the one thing that these guys understand is that you're a team...and the goal is to go out and try and win games and you deal with the stuff after the game. I think that MLB and the Players Union have negotiated that there is an appeal process, so, I think you let it play out. Everyone is going to have an opinion and that is just the world that we live in, but I think you let it play out. I don't think there's any room for PED's in baseball, I think the record should be accomplished the right way, and I think it's through hard work. I don't believe in shortcuts because I think everyone gets shortchanged when there's shortcuts. I think it's kind of clear of what the expectations are by where I put him in the lineup. I expect him to drive in runs and to have productive at bats for us and to play third base. He'll DH some too. You know he has to work into that every day playing shape again. He's worked hard to get to this point. Jeter hits the disabled list in order to make room for Alex Rodriguez. What kind of odds could you have gotten on that in Vegas? Since this photo A-Rod has been seen on the field, shaking hands with some people sitting in the dugout, although, I am not so sure they were seeking such a welcome. Rodriguez will speak at 615PM EST, but his manager, Joe Girardi is up first at 600PM EST. Here is A-Rod in 2009 after it was revealed that A-Rod failed a 2003 drug test. The key statement here from Alex was: Judge me from today forward. This from the Boston Red Sox All-Star infielder: I'm glad this happened. You want everybody on the same page. We shouldn't be competing against guys who use drugs like that. This is interesting. I don't think they should \"get out\" of the contract, if that means not paying out the deal less his time suspended, and I don't believe Buck thinks that either. However, I can certainly be convinced that the Yankees should be be charged A-Rod's salary against the luxury tax, which is a far more reasonable request. It's hard to say what is the right move here, somewhere in the middle maybe? What do you think? Tweet @LengelDavid or emaildavid.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com What will we get at 615EST, when A-Rod speaks this time? Click here to view MLB players suspended in Biogenesis PED scandal \u2013 in pictures It is also worth reminding you that these suspensions were made based on \"non-analytical evidence\" which is evidence other than a positive drug test. This also represents a major step forward for MLB and should not be forgotten. Just to reconfirm, here is a list of those who were suspended today for their links to the Biogenesis of America anti-aging clinic which was accused of providing MLB players with performance-enhancing drugs: Major League players Alex Rodriguez, 3B, New York Yankees Everth Cabrera, SS, San Diego Padres Antonio Bastardo, P, Philadelphia Phillies Francisco Cervelli, C, New York Yankees Jesus Montero, C, Seattle Mariners Jhonny Peralta, SS, Detroit Tigers Jordany Valdespin, INF, New York Mets Minor leaguers players Sergio Escalona, P, Houston Astros Fernando Martinez, OF, New York Yankees Jordan Norberto, P, free agent Antonio Bastardo, P, Philadelphia Phillies Cesar Puello, OF, New York Mets All players will serve suspensions of 50 games starting immediately with the exception of Jordan Norberto, whose suspension begins when he signs with a team, and Alex Rodriguez, whose suspension of 211 games begins on Thursday and is pending an appeal. A-rod will play tonight for the Yankees in Chicago. This from the Detroit Tigers All-Star pitcher: I want a clean game. I want an even playing field all around baseball and I think a majority of guys feel that way. There's more evidence of players unwillingness to put up with performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. The Yankees begin today 9.5 games behind Tampa Bay in the American League East, but are just 4.5 games out of a playoff spot. Despite putting out a lineup that is 13 of 15 AL teams in runs scored, they are nowhere near out of it. Now that Granderson is back, if A-Rod can get hot and Jeter can get his health together, well, you know the script by now. Unless A-Rod comes out of the dugout, trips and sprains his ankle on a jar of pine tar, chances are he can top what other Yankees third basemen have provided them thus far in 2103: BA: .215 OBP: .272 SLG: .285 HR: 4 SO: 102 BB: 22 Ugly. In other news, apparently, Vernon Wells is playing first base tonight...for the first time in his career. Ugly. In case Jack Curry wasn't a good enough source for you, here's the Yankees lineup right from the dugout in Chicago...or around there somewhere. It's on. A-Rod press conference is scheduled for 615PM EST. That is going to be interesting, eh? Should suspended players be allowed to return to their teams for the postseason? Maybe, maybe not, but right now there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. Last season, the San Francisco Giants told Melky Cabrera, who had been suspended for 50 games, to go home once he served his time. During that time they had acquired Marco Scutaro, who would go on to lead the Giants to the World Series title, which helped them make that decision. However, it already looks that both Cruz and Peralta would be welcomed back into the clubhouses in Texas and Detroit should they make the playoffs. Postseaon eligibility is something that could be discussed if and when MLB and the MLBPA reopen their Joint Frug Program for ammendments. ...and speaking of the NY Post... Joel Sherman of the NY Post has been on MLB Network for awhile now, talking about how A-Rod could potentially help the Yankees get to the playoffs, and then be off the payroll for next year when they are trying to stay below the $189m threshold to avoid a substantial luxury tax. It means they could keep several of their free agents, including Robinson Cano and Curtis Granderson without crossing that threshold. That would be something else. My colleague Michael Solomon weighs in with a piece that explains the Biogenesis PEDs scandal. A-Rod aside, what we have learned throughout the period in which Biogenesis was being investigated, is that there has been an unprecedented shift among the players which make up Major League Baseball in terms of their tolerance for PED's in their sport. For years we believed that the key to cleaning up sports was harsh penalties from above, from governing bodies. We are now learning that for any policy to really work, there needs to be a cultural shift among the athletes who play to not tolerate drugs - that is the only real way to make substantial progress in ridding games of banned substances. Players are now concerned with their livelihoods being affected by those seeking to get an edge, that became clear as MLB players publicly issued their disgust at drugs in their game in previous weeks. That is an enormous move forward, one which I believe will force open the collective bargaining agreement to put even harsher penalties in place and the main reason I believe that at some point soon, MLB's drugs program will be the gold standard in world sport, somrthing that was unimaginable a short time ago. Evan Weiner checks in with a piece on the Commissioner of Baseball, Bud Selig, whose complicated legacy is tied to the suspensions today. Bloopie2 wants to know what will happen: If he loses an appeal and ends up being suspended until 2015, then attempts to return to the Yankees... The answer is, as soon as he comes back, A-Rod would be paid what he is owed, which is $61 from 2015. He also has five clauses for hitting a series of career home run marks, all of which could earn him $30m total. The next target is 660 homers, 13 away - that would earn him $6m. By appealing the suspension, A-Rod will continue to be paid, as he has all season, until the suspension is enforced. However, by stepping on the field tonight, New York will be liable for all of his 2013 salary to this point, a pro-rated total of $28m. With A-Rod out with a hip injury, insurance would have covered a portion of this salary this season had he stayed on the sideline. So rumors of the life banishment for Alex Rodriguez via the \"baseball best interests\" clause in the collective bargaining agreement began to dissipate in the run-up to the suspensions today. Many have written that using that clause instead of suspending A-Rod via the Joint Program, which took place today, was \"seriously considered\" but the question is - did MLB ever really intend to use the clause, which would have been very difficult if not impossible for players and their union to accept? Or, were MLB leaking that threat in oder to force A-Rod's camp to accept a suspension without an appeal to keep him off the field, something that MLB did not want to happen while other players were serving suspensions? Well, that's one way of looking at it. Another way is that the Mets have found a way of getting the despised Jordany Valdespin off the field, even if that field is in Las Vegas, home of their AAA team. These are small, little, petty fan feelings though. Eric Byrnes is saying on MLB Network that he is ashamed to have been part of the game during the steroids era, that he would be disgusted to be in the dugout with A-Rod tonight, and also on the field with the starting pitcher, Andy Pettitte, who also admitted using PED's. So not much from A-Rod other than his disappointment which is obvious, no barb similar to the Yankees regarding medical treatment which came in earlier. I am disappointed with the penalty and intend to appeal and fight through the process. I am eager to get back on the field and be with my teammates in Chicago tonight. I want to thank my family, friends and fas who have stood by my side through all of this. Earlier, we published a timeline of Alex Rodriguez' travails. So the union is upset by the leaks and the way that Alex Rodriguez' case has been handled. This is a sign that although MLB and MLBPA are now working together to rid PED's from the game, the union is still prepared to fight for due process which makes a lot of sense from their perspective. Here's what the head of the players' union has to to say about the suspensions: The accepted suspensions announced today are consistent with the punishments set forth in the Joint Drug Agreement, and were arrived at only after hours of intense negotiations between the bargaining parties, the players and their representatives. For the player appealing, Alex Rodriguez, we agree with his decision to fight his suspension. We believe that the Commissioner has not acted appropriately under the Basic Agreement. Mr. Rodriguez knows that the Union, consistent with its history, will defend his rights vigorously. The Union's members have made it clear that they want a clean game. They support efforts to discipline players, and harshly, to help ensure an even playing field for all. The players support the Union's efforts to uphold the JDA while at the same time guaranteeing that players receive the due process rights and confidentiality protections granted under the agreement. Lastly, I want to close by stating our profound disappointment in the way individuals granted access to private and privileged information felt compelled to share that information publicly. The manner in which confidential information was so freely exchanged is not only a threat to the success and credibility of our jointly administered program; it calls into question the level of trust required to administer such a program. It is our view that when the bargaining parties hold their annual review of the program, we must revisit the JDA's confidentiality provisions and consider implementing stricter rules for any breach by any individual involved in the process. You have to say that the Tigers were smart to get insurance for Jhonny Peralta being suspended, acquiring Jose Iglesias at the trade deadline, aeven if it did cost them a future regular outfielder in Avisal Garcia. Note - the Tigers have 53 games left in the season, so Peralta could return with time before the playoffs. However, the Rangers, who struggle to score, and are in an extremely tough race for a playoff berth, have no adequate replacement for Nelson Cruz right now. They have to hope their pitching is enough to get them to the postseason when Cruz can return. Something else that should be considered. Derek Jeter may be heading to the DL for a third time this season, this time with a right calf strain. With the captain down, that would arguably make this A-Rod's team in a weird and wild kind of way, for the first time since he landed in New York in 2004. That little box on the lower left corner means possibility of rain in Chicago tonight. Everyone wants to see the show, that being A-Rod's debut for a team that presumably hates him, in front of fans famous for disco demolition night, so if we collectively use our minds to block any precipitation, perhaps we can make it happen. Yes, and by coming out right away and getting that lingering question about the medial care afforded A-Rod during his rehabilitation from a second hip surgery, they have fired the first shot in what could be an ugly war. However, it remains to be seen how public all of this will play out. During the lead up to today, there were leaks everywhere. Will the leaks tighten up? Here's the full statement from the Yankees: We are in full support of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention program. We also recognize and respect the appeals process. Until the process under the Drug Program is complete we will have no comment. We are confident that the process outlined in the Drug Program will result in appropriate resolution of this matter. In the meantime, the Yankees remain focused on playing baseball. However, we are compelled to address certain reckless and false allegations concerning the Yankees' role in this matter. The New York Yankees in no way instituted and/or assisted MLB in the direction of this investigation; or used the investigation as an attempt to avoid responsibilities under a player contract; or did its medical staff fail to provide the appropriate standard of care to Alex Rodriguez. Separately, we are dissapointed with the news today of the suspension of Francisco Cervelli. It's clear that he used bad judgement. Rodriguez' suspension begins on Thursday and he is expected to appeal. There would be a hearing within 20 days where A-Rod will challenge MLB's findings. Then Fredric Horowitz, baseball's arbitrator, will have 25 games to come to his judgement. So the A-Rod show will be a long, drawn out process that should have plenty of twists and turns, which we are used to seeing with A-Rod. So all of this means that the A-Rod show is on in Chicago where a turn-back-the-clock Bronx Zoo atmosphere takes shape in the Midwest. Unless he is deemed unhealthy, he will be in the lineup against the White Sox, who should have nothing less than a monstrous walk up crowd drawn by the bizarre situation. Right now, the weather it seems is one of the only powers that can keep him off the field, there is a chance of rain. Opposite ends of the spectrum here, a superstar and a \"nobody\" who competed for a job against a player who was suspended today for using PED's. \"Baseball is a lot bigger than Alex Rodriguez\" -A-Rod in 2009 during a spring training press conference after revealing his prior steroid use from 2001-2003. Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Melky Cabrera, Oakland Athletics pitcher Bartolo Colon and Padres catcher Yasmani Grandal received and served discipline for positive tests relating to this case prior to this announcement and will not be subject to further penalties. It should be noted that Gio Gonzalez of the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles infielder Danny Valencia, two more names that were previously linked to the Biogenesis of America wellness clinic, were not on the list today following MLB's investigation. Here's the full statement from Cruz: I have been notified by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball that I have been suspended for 50 games for violation of the Joint Drug Agreement. I have decided to accept this suspension and not exercise my rights under the Basic Agreement to appeal. From November, 2011 to January, 2012, I was seriously ill with a gastrointestinal infection, helicobactor pylori, which went undiagnosed for over a month. By the time I was properly diagnosed, I had lost 40 pounds. Just weeks before I was to report for spring training in 2012, I was unsure whether I would be physically able to play. I should have handled the situation differently, and my illness was no excuse. I am thankful for the unwavering support of my friends, family and teammates during this difficult time. I look forward to regaining the trust and respect of the Rangers organization, and the great Rangers' fans, and I am grateful for the opportunity to rejoin the team for the playoffs. Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, has released a statement. Here it is in full: Major League Baseball has worked diligently with the Players Association for more than a decade to make our Joint Drug Program the best in all of professional sports. I am proud of the comprehensive nature of our efforts - not only with regard to random testing, groundbreaking blood testing for human Growth Hormone and one of the most significant longitudinal profiling programs in the world, but also our investigative capabilities, which proved vital to the Biogenesis case. Upon learning that players were linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, we vigorously pursued evidence that linked those individuals to violations of our Program. We conducted a thorough, aggressive investigation guided by facts so that we could justly enforce our rules. Despite the challenges this situation has created during a great season on the field, we pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do. For weeks, I have noted the many players throughout the game who have strongly voiced their support on this issue, and I thank them for it. I appreciate the unwavering support of our owners and club personnel, who share my ardent desire to address this situation appropriately. I am also grateful to the Professional Baseball Athletic Trainers Society and our club physicians, who were instrumental in the banning of amphetamines and whose expertise remains invaluable to me. As an institution, we have made unprecedented strides together. It is important to point out that 16,000 total urine and blood tests were conducted on players worldwide under MLB Drug Programs in 2012. With the important additions of the hGH testing and longitudinal profiling this season, we are more confident than ever in the effectiveness of the testing program. Those players who have violated the Program have created scrutiny for the vast majority of our players, who play the game the right way. This case resoundingly illustrates that the strength of our Program is not limited only to testing. We continue to attack this issue on every front - from science and research, to education and awareness, to fact-finding and investigative skills. Major League Baseball is proud of the enormous progress we have made, and we look forward to working with the players to make the penalties for violations of the Drug Program even more stringent and a stronger deterrent. As a social institution with enormous social responsibilities, Baseball must do everything it can to maintain integrity, fairness and a level playing field. We are committed to working together with players to reiterate that performance-enhancing drugs will not be tolerated in our game. Alex Rodriguez' suspension is 211 games, a suspension that includes the postseason for 2013 and 2014 and does not start immediately, presumably procedural move, and he will now almost definitely play tonight vs the Chicago White Sox. All players except for Alex Rodriguez will serve 50 game suspensions. They agreed to accept them without appeal and will begin serving those suspensions immediately. Should their teams make the playoffs, they will be elgible to return to the roster. First things first, who is suspended: Major League players Alex Rodriguez, 3B, New York Yankees Everth Cabrera, SS, San Diego Padres Antonio Bastardo, P, Philadelphia Phillies Francisco Cervelli, C, New York Yankees Jesus Montero, C, Seattle Mariners Jhonny Peralta, SS, Detroit Tigers Jordany Valdespin, INF, New York Mets Minor leaguers players Sergio Escalona, P, Houston Astros Fernando Martinez, OF, New York Yankees Jordan Norberto, P, free agent Antonio Bastardo, P, Philadelphia Phillies Cesar Puello, OF, New York Mets Major League Baseball has suspended 13 players due to their involvement with Biogenesis of America, the now closed anti-aging wellness clinic accused of supplying performance-enhancing drugs to MLB players. Top of the list of players suspended is New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez, the highest-paid player in baseball, and facing a 211 game suspension."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
