Back come Jimmy Anderson, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow while Moeen Ali \u201cremains unavailable for Test cricket\u201d. There is clearly a determination not to be caught short this time, especially since this series, unlike the one in New Zealand, counts in the Test Championship. The party contains 17 players, which means that the solitary absentee from New Zealand is the Lancashire pace bowler Saqib Mahmood. This is a large squad for a modern tour, which from Boxing Day onwards consists only of Test cricket. Ed Smith, the national selector, explained why. \u201cIt is not predicted that Mark [Wood] will be available for selection for the earliest matches. However, he will travel with the team and continue his rehab work with the medical staff on tour. There is no exact date given for his return. \u201cWith that in mind, and given the extended period that James [Anderson] and Mark have had on the sidelines due to injury, it was sensible to have a 17-man squad.\u201d Wood last played Test cricket for England in St Lucia in February, while Anderson had just one grim match against Australia in August\u2019s first Test at Birmingham. Both are in Cape Town as part of their rehabilitation. The ECB notes that \u201cYorkshire batsman, Jonny Bairstow, returns to the squad.\u201d Is this is a conscious reminder of his status? He is no longer referred to as England\u2019s wicketkeeper/batsman. That role remains with Jos Buttler, who had an uncomfortable time in his solitary Test in New Zealand. However, Bairstow will not need any reminding to pack his gloves. If Buttler is indisposed we can be sure that Bairstow rather than Ollie Pope will take over behind the stumps even though Smith emphasised: \u201cThat\u2019s a matter for the captain and coach.\u201d More intriguing is whether Bairstow makes the side as a batsman. He is a very senior citizen to spend five weeks ferrying drinks. Where does the batting vacancy lie? Most probably at No 3, a position he has taken on with some reluctance in the past. South Africa, if they have the chance to contemplate the details of the forthcoming series in the chaos that seems to exist in the running of their game, would probably rather bowl to Dom Sibley as opposed to Bairstow on Boxing Day. There is clearly a case for opening with Joe Denly from the start with Bairstow at three. It may be the agonising about Bairstow will be another thorny issue that runs and runs \u2013 unless he starts there and scores runs and runs. Smith, who travelled north with James Taylor for an in-depth conversation with Bairstow two days after his omission from the Test squad for New Zealand, chose his words carefully. \u201cIt was always a possibility that he would return to the Test team. Jonny Bairstow at his best is an asset and he could fill a number of roles.\u201d Smith pointed out that Bairstow averages 57 in first-class cricket since he was first picked for England in 2012, the implication being that he has the tools to play as a specialist batsman. The national selector also hinted at some frustration at Moeen\u2019s absence: \u201cIn an ideal world we would like him to be available. He asked for a break and that\u2019s happened but at this stage I don\u2019t know when he might return. Our hope is that he does return to Test cricket. In our discussions he did say that he felt that there were more Test runs and wickets in him. We are going to keep in regular touch with him.\u201d However, Smith said that no timeframe had been established. As with Bairstow it might have been tricky to have someone of Moeen\u2019s seniority ferrying drinks in South Africa. Obviously they would like to have him in Sri Lanka at the end of March, where he would be certain to be in the team but there is a complication here since Moeen has just signed a lucrative deal to play in the Pakistan T20 League, which coincides with the Test series. Moeen\u2019s unavailability for South Africa means that Matt Parkinson embarks upon another tour although the chances of him playing in the Tests are low. So there remain a few imponderables within the England team, which sets off on Friday. However, their campaign seems strong and stable compared to that of their opponents, who are faced with the challenge of somehow isolating themselves from the chaos of the administration of South African cricket. The only thing both parties there seem to agree upon is that the tour must go ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
