The best indicator of this healthy state of affairs in this programme was an outstanding performance of Sibelius's Fifth Symphony. Oramo is himself Finnish, and seems to know how to shape the music of his compatriot. The way in which Sibelius frequently wrote his large-scale works - letting the listener glimpse traces of themes in short, fleeting phrases before knitting them together into something monumental - means that his music can seem disjointed, yet Oramo maintained an unforced sense of momentum throughout. And, in this kaleidoscopic symphony, the colours blended yet remained distinct, sombre passages dissolving into jaunty, folk-like episodes. There was an elemental brightness to the brass fanfares as the opening movement raced to its finish, and the simple theme of the second took on a wealth of distinctive characters as it was passed around the orchestra. Earlier in the programme the orchestra was to have been joined by the highly experienced Heinrich Schiff for Dvorak's Cello Concerto. However, Schiff was indisposed, and the opportunity to take over went to the young German cellist Alban Gerhardt. If Gerhardt's relative inexperience showed at all it was in the fact that he tended to push his sound too much in an attempt to fill the vast hall. Yet his playing was highly musical, full of lyrical, generously sustained phrases. The four corners of the orchestra were on show in George Benjamin's Sudden Time, completed in 1993. At times Benjamin uses the most ethereal sounds he can find - barely audible muted brass, or harmonics from a small number of scattered string players - so that noises seem to come from nowhere, and he also makes the real source of the piece's driving rhythms difficult to pinpoint. We are told he set out to achieve this \"sense of elasticity\", but along the way he created a highly coloured orchestral showpiece, here given an impressively assured performance.
