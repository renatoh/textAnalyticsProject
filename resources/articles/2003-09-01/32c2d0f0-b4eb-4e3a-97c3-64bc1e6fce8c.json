The Scottish striker has been largely forgotten at Goodison Park with the young gun Wayne Rooney grabbing the limelight. But Rooney was missing against Stockport last night and Ferguson took the most of his rare starting opportunity, scoring twice in the 3-0 victory. His first came from the penalty spot in the 25th minute after the full-back Tony Hibbert had been brought down by Aaron Lescott and he added a second in the 56th minute, firing home after some brilliant work from James McFadden. The youngster Nick Chadwick was another who cashed in on a place in the starting line-up, netting his fourth senior Everton goal just before half-time. It took Mario Jardel only 14 minutes of his full debut to open his account for Bolton as they enjoyed a 3-1 victory against Walsall from the First Division. The Brazilian headed past the Saddlers goalkeeper James Walker following an Ibrahim Ba lay-off to put Sam Allardyce's side in front and capped a memorable personal performance with a second goal 10 minutes before the end. Kevin Nolan also scored for Wanderers with a Paul Merson strike in the 74th minute merely a consolation for Walsall. The local derby at the Kassam Stadium went in favour of the visitors as managerless Reading won 3-1 at Oxford. The former England winger John Salako grabbed the opening goal in the 52nd minute, Nicky Forster doubling the lead 14 minutes later. Oxford pulled a goal back in the 78th minute through Jefferson Louis but the Royals wrapped up the win and a place in the third round when James Harper scored in the 90th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
