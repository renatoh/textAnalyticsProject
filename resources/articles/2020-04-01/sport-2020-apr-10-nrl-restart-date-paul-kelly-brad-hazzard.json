Earlier, Brad Hazzard, the New South Wales health minister, said he had not been consulted on the league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time, which was announced on Thursday following meetings of the league\u2019s innovation committee and the ARL Commission. Channel Nine, the competition\u2019s broadcasting rights co-holder, has also claimed it had been left out of talks over the resumption proposal. Speaking on Friday, Kelly said he did not believe the NRL should be considered \u201ca law unto themselves\u201d and that the league and its players, like the rest of country, have an important role to play in attempts to control the Covid-19 outbreak. Kelly also said a return to the field of play on 28 May could be too soon given how rapidly the virus can be spread. \u201cI don\u2019t think they [the NRL] are a law unto themselves,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cSome of the players and coaches may think so, but they\u2019re part of society and they have a part \u2013 as we have all done \u2013 to support not only safety for themselves but for all of us. \u201cWe all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track. \u201cWhat we know about this virus, if we don\u2019t have these social distancing measures, [is that] one person can lead to 400 other cases within a month. We just cannot afford at this stage to be considering that happening.\u201d Given their age and health, and that games would be played behind closed doors, Kelly said the cohort of players were of less concern than those around them in a more vulnerable age group \u2013 a group that includes the likes of coaches Wayne Bennett and Ricky Stuart. \u201cFor them [the players], it may not be a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other people around the teams \u2013 Wayne Bennett is in his 70s, he would be in a vulnerable group; Ricky Stuart with the mighty Raiders, he would potentially be in a vulnerable group \u2013 so thinking about the team, not just the players but the support around them, is important. \u201cThey\u2019re making their plans for the road out [of the shutdown] and I encourage them to do so in other sports. But whether May is the time will remain to be seen and definitely they\u2019ll need to get some permission to do that.\u201d Exact details over the format of the competition if and when it resumes remain unclear, although an exit strategy is likely to involve a NSW hub centred around Sydney. But Hazzard said on Friday he had not been involved in talks about a restart \u2013 nor had he even spoken with league officials since before the suspension of the season after just two rounds. \u201cThe NRL came to see me about a month, or five weeks, ago. There have been no further discussions,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cThe only meeting I\u2019ve had that I can tell you about is around about a month ago, with Todd Greenberg and Peter V\u2019Landys to talk about the issue. \u201cBut that was before they actually made a decision to shut the game down. So I haven\u2019t had any discussions with them at this stage.\u201d Hazzard said he would, however, be open to talks, although a balance would have to be struck between the benefits of the league returning and the safety implications of that. \u201cIf the NRL want to go ahead, [I\u2019m] happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the right balance, I\u2019m happy to talk to the NRL, because as health minister, I also know that we need to have a sense of balance about our life, a sense of mental health and I know a lot of people enjoy seeing sport. \u201cSo we can have that conversation with them. I\u2019m not giving any indication one way or the other.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
