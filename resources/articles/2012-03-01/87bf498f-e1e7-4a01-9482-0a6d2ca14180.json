The Republic of Ireland manager confirmed that he intends to take five strikers to Poland and Ukraine, as some of them also offer options in wide areas, while a prominent name-check for the Derby County midfielder Paul Green pointed towards his inclusion, removing, in many people's eyes, the final question mark over the squad's 23rd player. Trapattoni has made it clear he prefers experience and that he will keep faith with the players who helped Ireland to qualify for their first major finals since the 2002 World Cup. The midfielders Keith Fahey, Darron Gibson and Stephen Hunt are in his thoughts and with the back-up defenders Stephen Kelly, Kevin Foley and Darren O'Dea expected to travel, the door to the squad appears bolted, barring injuries. The major concern is Richard Dunne, the talismanic central defender, who is a long-term casualty with a fractured shoulder. But Trapattoni remains confident that he will return for at least the final game of Aston Villa's season and he noted that Dunne would also have the friendlies against Bosnia and Hungary at the end of the domestic campaign, in addition to a training game against local opposition during the pre-tournament camp in Italy. Trapattoni has always liked Green; he started him in the first four qualifying ties and turned to him when he made his first substitutions in the 1-1 friendly against the Czech Republic in Dublin on Wednesday. The Italian was musing about his five strikers, mentioning how Jon Walters and Simon Cox could play on the right or left when he brought up Green's name. \"Usually in this competition,\" he added, \"with games every three days, the defenders or midfielders get a yellow card and we have to keep that in mind. We must pay attention in this position [central midfield]. We have the good alternatives.\" Trapattoni's instinct has long been not to meddle with the tried and trusted and, at this late stage, it feels unlikely that exciting young players such as McCarthy and McClean will make the cut from the standby group. The Republic's manager drew a typically colourful parallel to a ship with the wind in its sails that needed to maintain course. He left McCarthy as an unused substitute against the Czechs and gave McClean his debut only as a 79th-minute substitute. \"I said to James McCarthy during the game to watch what happened during various situations,\" Trapattoni said. \"He is young, also McClean, For this tournament, he's too young. The preference is experience. I hope we don't have injuries ... the great squad is this. \"When I saw the tremendous reaction from the crowd to McClean coming on, I thought: 'Is Messi or Maradona or Pel\u00e9 coming on?' I'm only joking ... I know what happens with the people and it's good for him. There is enthusiasm. But McGeady, Duff \u2026 they deserve respect. Go slowly, slowly [with the young players].\" Ireland's likely squad for Euro 2012 Goalkeepers: Given, Westwood, Forde Defenders: O'Shea, Kelly, Foley, Dunne, St Ledger, O'Dea, Ward Midfielders: Duff, Whelan, Andrews, Fahey, Gibson, Green, McGeady, Hunt Strikers: Keane, Doyle, Long, Cox, Walters"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
