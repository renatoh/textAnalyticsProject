Investors in a new yacht, The Whistlejacket, could soon be making the dream a reality. The Whistlejacket, a 425ft vessel named after the fabulous racehorse painted by Stubbs, is an extremely upmarket timeshare scheme. It will spend summers meandering around the Mediterranean and winters in the Caribbean. Its size means it will be able to anchor in harbours that are off the main cruise ship routes. Charles Weston-Baker of agents FPD Savills (020 7824 9030) says the yacht will offer all the luxuries you would expect - 25 'really superb state rooms', each more than 400 square feet in size, a 'whacking great' pool to the stern, health and fitness rooms, hairdressers and beauty salons. There are numerous lounges so you don't have to trip over the same holidaymakers all the time and a staff of about 60 who will provide 24-hour service. As for the food, 'The yacht will cost \u00a35m to \u00a36m a year to run, so you can imagine that the food will be exceptional,' Weston-Baker says. Not surprisingly membership does not come cheap, at \u00a3375,000 a head. The yacht will be owned in trust by 210 members, who will be entitled to three or four weeks' holiday on board each year with a partner (the generous can donate this time to family and friends). Holidays, normally lasting 10 days, will be selected six months in advance based on an itinerary sent out to all members. Children aged six and over will be allowed on board only during school holidays. The founders aim to cover part, if not all, the running costs by chartering it out for about 11 weeks a year at $110,000 a day. But potential investors should bear in mind that this market is not yet proven, and they may have to stump up further money in future. The Whistlejacket is expected to take two years to complete. Four shipyards around the world have been identified as potential builders, but work will not begin until 180 members have signed up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
