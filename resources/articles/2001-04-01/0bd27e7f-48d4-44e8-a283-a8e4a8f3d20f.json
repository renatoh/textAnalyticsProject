From 1950s trad-jazz gadabout to international pop guru, Napier-Bell has seen it all and remembered most of it: he has seen superstars when they were simpering wee lads, and shared blowjob secrets with the great gay-UK pop sodality (Larry Parnes, Lionel Bart, Tom Watkins). On the surface, he's pure surface; but anyone familiar with Napier-Bell's previous 1960s summa (\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\") won't be surprised to learn that Black Vinyl, White Powder isn't just a name-drop glide through limo-land. Napier-Bell can tell spontaneous pop gold from titanic fraud, and sets down his patented form of higher gossip with a (kind of) moral purpose. If you're itching for the drug revelations his latest title seems to promise, you may be disappointed: there is little here that a reasonably aware scumsurfer couldn't have gleaned over the last decade - a period when all the dirty secrets previously kept by attorneys or dealers became public domain via the tabloidisation of the music press, various tell-all autobiographies and the advent of list TV (\"The 20 Greatest ODs of All Time!\"). Napier-Bell's cockily Manichaean title is just good PR come-on: showbiz has always been a snow biz, just as it has always been shaped by the ambisexual nous of gay managers and shored up by a hinterland of shadowy accounts (the offshore kind). This isn't a drugs book. Napier-Bell is not always accurate and accepts too many of the narco-mythologies at face value; but he's also canny enough to realise that, finally, all this shock-horror drug stuff is essentially a blind - an Apocalypse Now whizz-bang behind which greater crimes are carved out. Pop's real scandals involve low-end financial and contractual practices, but such is their small-print nature that they tend to fall all too conveniently between the business pages and the tabloid splash, and are rarely aired. Thus, the real insider revelations here concern the business of business. Napier-Bell is good on the inelegantly Byzantine clauses of early-1960s pop and how the major labels have always used self-serving sharp practices (like chart-rigging) to \"police\" themselves. He's also good on how 1960s pop was shaped - both in the boardroom and the studio - by unsung gay pioneers: there are incisive portraits of Kit Lambert, Joe Meek, Brian Epstein. (It is also heartening that the few things that still get his old heart racing - Pulp, Massive Attack, Daniel Miller's Mute label - are far from the Brits-approved norm.) Even at his most scurrilous, Napier-Bell is never knowingly nasty; he doesn't moralise, and has a truly sane acceptance of drugs and sex and their place in a hedonistic world. Napier-Bell reserves his real bile for our current Popstars moment, seeing in it not just a failure of creative nerve, but a wider, more worrying trend: the total eradication of personality in the name of profit. He's no Theodor Adorno, nor meant to be, but even Napier-Bell - arch scam-artist, king of the hype frontier - thinks things have gone too far in an industry in which the virtues of long-game creativity have been binned in favour of quick-hit global niche marketing. The only MacGowan in Napier-Bell's index is Cathy; but Shane MacGowan - in his own devil's-tune, dishevelled way - is as much a part of postmodern pop as H from Steps. If the boyband universe represents the triumph of product over personality, then MacGowan represents a strange Adults Only version which is all personality and - polite cough - never mind the music; his floggable persona has become the product, replacing anything so quaint as an actual CD of new material. Even a generous reading of MacGowan's career can't sidestep the fact that his best work was a long, long time ago. His true role is to keep all us old rock bores diverted - \"Ooh, did you hear the latest about Shane!\" - while the real business of pop business goes on. Is Shane a rebel heart way \"outside the system\" or one of its worst manifestations? The last bard in town or a lyric souse increasingly nearer late Jeffrey Bernard than mid-period Gram Parsons? It is probably safe to say that if MacGowan - a self-described \"alcoholic junkie Republican\" - didn't exist, the music industry wouldn't go out of its way to invent him. But he has done pretty well off the back of his role as ravaged ghost at pop's sushi feast. A gift for a dirt-hungry media with urgent space to fill, Shane is good X-rated copy, a 21st-century blarney stone for whom the pub- bound Q&amp;A has become an easy supper song. (In his shaky confessional hands, sex and drugs and rock'n'roll has been reduced to drugs and drugs and more drugs.) If you want to be bright-side pretentious, he's taken on a kind of shamanic/storyteller role; if you want to be cynical, he's just a proxy low-life Calvary for all the little middle-class hacks. From John Lennon to the Gallagher Brothers, taking in John Lydon, Shaun Ryder and MacGowan, little England has had a weird on/off love affair with bolshy Irish boys: junkies, misogynists and thieves, anarchists and IRA supporters. The best and most revealing part of A Drink With . . . concerns the Irish in Britain: the early chapters covering MacGowan's upbringing on an Irish farm and his parents' subsequent unhappy move to Brighton have the vividness of good fiction. (Or of old Shane MacGowan songs.) It's also the only part that adds anything new to our perception of the man. Only latecomers will be shocked by well-read MacGowan, just one of the many selves he stores behind that perma-slur exterior, which may itself be the ultimate - and fussily contrived - snow job. (As in Willie Nelson's cogent line: \"Hell, I only drink so much so people won't think I'm a dope fiend.\") MacGowan's flock will find little that's new - and would anyway prefer stormin' new work from your man rather than one more helping of an increasingly stale gonzo mythology. MacGowan is still an involving - if inconsistent - anecdotalist. In the space of a few pages he remembers himself as greasy rocker, punk, soulboy, freak, faux -rentboy and self-proclaimed enemy of all of the above. A canny (or simply awake) editor would have excised a central section which is hapless repetition, pub trivia and a large helping of interruptive vanity on Ms Clarke's part. Even her quasi-marital status doesn't stop MacGowan losing his temper when her questions slip below an acceptable baseline of dim-wittedness. Her intermittent \"scene setting\" is truly gruesome in its ineptness and, more crucially, she can't interview to save her (or his) life. There are moments when MacGowan's mask begins to slip, revealing a world of pain and perplexity, but Clarke (deliberately?) fumbles them, apparently more concerned with showing herself in a good Rock Girlfriend light. As such, A Drink With . . . is as nauseatingly cosy as any Hello! interview. I mean: how would we react to any other rock star being \"profiled\" by their live-in lover? There are hints that MacGowan is less than happy with either the book or his wider station, and flashes of a truly fearsome anger that suggest a substantially different Shane from the one Clarke prepared earlier, and offers us here. Still, by choosing not to exercise his seigniorial veto, MacGowan shows in A Drink With . . . that he is happy to carry on with his attenuated role as rock's jaundiced jester: a role he plays, if not with good grace, then with a kind of weary alcoholic stoicism. \"They all buy me drinks - what can I do?\" Well, he could lock himself away in a cottage somewhere and come up with a truly redemptive comeback, like his friends Nick Cave and Steve Earle, or his hero Tom Waits. Except that there are people like Clarke ready to facilitate the myth, while the media is happy to accept his bleary disingenuousness at face value. Everyone just shrugs and says, ah well: that's Shane! Or you might just wonder at how dehumanised both he and we have become if our idea of entertainment is overseeing the macabre spectacle of this man burying himself alive. You need only compare the ferocious industry of Charles Bukowski, say, with the befuddled last words of Kurt Cobain to realise how crucial, still, is the demarcation between art \"about\" privation and real, lived despair. With Shane MacGowan, the Orphic function seems to have been shucked off a way back, leaving only a faintly terminal form of jive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
