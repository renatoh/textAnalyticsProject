On his board appeared the number seven. It was tempting to think that he had simply misspelt the number one, but this threat was utterly serious: as it transpired it was 10 minutes before the referee finally blew his whistle. It still being the first half nothing, of course, happened. Nothing much does, of any great importance, when West Brom are playing - until the last few minutes. This was a sixth successive win for the Premiership pretenders, the last four of which have been secured in the final 11 minutes. Indeed Lee Hughes's goal here was the most premature of the sequence - Crystal Palace had fallen to two goals in the last nine minutes, Ipswich and Wigan only in stoppage time. As the season heads into its final stages, this is a team whose determination will never waver - even if their style might. \"We know we didn't play that well today,\" said Paul Robinson, impressive at left-back. \"We knew it was going to be a hard game and we just needed to grind the result out, which we have done in a few of the other games that we've played.\" Now they are close to grinding out the biggest result of all: promotion. Today they visit Millwall, thrashed 4-0 at Coventry on Saturday, then they play third-placed Sunderland. Two wins would leave them on the verge. \"If we get six points,\" said Gary Megson, \"I'll be ecstatic.\" But Megson will allow no pre mature celebrations. \"I accept that, given the situation we're in at the moment, if we can be very good over the next seven days we can do ourselves a big favour. If it goes the other way then we've got problems. I don't think we can afford to look forward to Sunderland. If you look beyond the next game you'll cause yourself problems. It's a huge game for us, but they're all going to be big, big games.\" Gillingham also have much to play for, if a somewhat less sunny outlook. This fifth successive defeat leaves them one point from the relegation places and reeling after their worst run in 12 years. Today they host Walsall, who have won their last two away games, to pull clear of trouble, and then welcome Ipswich. \"It's still in our hands,\" said Andy Hessenthaler. \"We've got two home games coming up; we've got to win both to stay up.\" They deserved a point here, even if it was their systematic time-wasting which led to all that first-half stoppage time. West Brom rarely looked settled, and were growing desperate when Lloyd Dyer's low shot fell at Hughes's feet a few yards from goal. Geoff Horsfield could have extended the lead five minutes later but maddeningly missed the target. Perhaps they had already used up their good fortune. \"I don't think we can say that was a classic performance today,\" said Megson, explaining his continuing caution. \"If we play like that in the remaining six games, it's not always going to drop to Lee Hughes six yards out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
