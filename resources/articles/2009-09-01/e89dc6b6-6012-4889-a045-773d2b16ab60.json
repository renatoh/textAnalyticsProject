Expanses of sand, purple-blue and cream, wetly shining, reflect the sky and the towering clouds. Curving strand lines mark the farthest reaches of previous tides. I follow the latest, looking idly for treasures, and am rewarded almost immediately with the most beautiful piece of sea glass I've ever found. Frosted to semi-opacity, sharp edges smoothed away, it is not the usual green, blue or white but a remarkable amethyst, and I wonder what it was once a part of. Some feet away, among a scatter of white and ivory limpet shells, something unusual catches my eye. It too is a shell, an exquisite shell, small and fragile and of a colour I've never seen before. It lies with its open side upward, a whorl of indigo spiralling from its centre and warming gradually to ultramarine and purple. The thinness of the shell walls renders its inner heart a transluscent violet. Turning it gently, I find the colours of the other side are faded like a bright cloth that has lain too long in the sun. It is too precious for my pocket; I wrap it in tissue and carry it home in my hand. It is some days before I discover what it is that I've found. What the sea has cast up is all that remains of a wanderer brought here by some chance combination of wind and tide. Delicate though the shell might be, its former inhabitant \u2013 a violet sea snail \u2013 was not. It is pelagic, a creature of the deep waters, where it floats, suspended, as if upside down, below a raft of trapped air bubbles \u2013 a life that seems in keeping with its fairytale colouring. But like most fairytales it has a dark side: the violet sea snail is a predator, feeding on other floating marine organisms and with a particular taste for another equally fascinating wanderer \u2013 the by-the-wind sailor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
