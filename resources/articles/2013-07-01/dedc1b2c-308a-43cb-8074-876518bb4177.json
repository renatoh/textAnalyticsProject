In the end it was decided in a couple of defining cameo moments for two US players. First Sean Johnson went a long way to put his Olympic nightmare behind him with a sharp reflex save, en route to a clean sheet that eluded Nick Rimando in the last couple of games. Then seconds later, as the US broke, Shea raced free on goal and managed to bundle his shot home, despite the solid Pemberton getting a hand to it. He didn't have long to make an impression after the last game's disappointment, and he took his chance when it came. And yet another assist by a certain Mr Donovan. And a full 90 minutes for Holden. Not his best game, but his longest international one since 2010 and that may be the more salient fact. It wasn't the big blowout win of the last three games, but it was also a game where the coach made his changes, saw his team find another gear, and got the result. It was pretty dull for long stretches, but a win against one of the remaining Hex rivals is nothing to be sneered at and now the US have an excellent chance of advancing through the quarter finals when they face El Salvador. Hope you'll join me for that one and thanks for your tweets and emails tonight. Sorry I didn't get a chance to use them all (particularly the more amusing, but downright filthy soundtrack suggestions). For now, good night. Final thoughts in a minute... Still time for a Corona turnover to lead to one more Costa Rica attack, but they can't get a clean shot at goal. Eventually Johnson claims a floating cross at the second attempt, and that will be the last significant action of the game. Chance for Costa Rica as Parkhurst clips Cunningham as he heads for goal. Free kick in a dangerous position left of center some 35 yards out. It's curled in dangerously towards goal, but Johnson does very well to stand his ground and smother the ball. The US nicely disrupting Costa Rica every time they try to get hold of the ball and closing down the Ticos nicely. Ball right where the US want it \u2014 deep in the Costa Rica half. Their opponents try to force their way upfield but Donovan is back defending to pick up a loose ball and send it back to his defense. Now the US are back playing keepball in the Costa Rica half, as we move into three minutes stoppage time. Costa Rica looking tired out there right now. Though I did once type that about Jamaica just before they scored. Actually, forget I spoke. I don't want to deal with the \"YOU JINXED THE NATS\" emails. Last few minutes and the US lead Costa Rica 1-0 through that Brek Shea goal. The US are set to meet El Salvador on Sunday in Baltimore as things stand. Johnson's save in the lead up to that goal was a really sharp stop beneath the crossbar. If he keeps a clean sheet that will easily be the highlight of his night. Can Costa Rica find the two goals they need to finish top and avoid Honduras? Or the one goal that would stop the US from going to eight consecutive wins? Wow! Orozco touches a long throw out for a corner. Can Costa Rica find Saborio? No, but a fantastic reflex save from Johnson starts the US on a counter and Donovan touches the ball inside to, who else, Brek Shea (admit it, you though of almost anyone else), who races free and pushes the ball past Pemberton for a goal that may have bought him an immediate international future. Shea forces his way to the byline and cuts back a dangerous looking ball but not to a US player and Costa Rica clear. A minute earlier, a snapshot from Diskerud forced a decent save from Pemberton by the way. Corona on for Bedoya by the way. All the US subs on \u2014 so Holden is going the full 90 minutes for the team for the first time since 2010. Still USA 0-0 Costa Rica Big quarter of an hour for Brek Shea, perhaps. that last performance left him somewhat in debit. He goes up for a header and loses out but earns a throw deep in the Costa Rica territory. Saborio on for Arrieta. Watch this space. Arrieta gets a yellow for going in late on Holden after a rather shapeless passage of play. It will bring on Gomez and Shea for Wondolowski and Torres. The latter was pretty quiet all night. Costa Rica on the front foot in the wake of their subs. And Saborio is warming up... Klinsmann leaving it late. A mini-sequence of Costa Rica corners is conducted amid jeers and boos from the US crowd. Finally it's cleared. Shea and Gomez about to come on for the USA. Last quarter of the game and it's, um, pretty unpretty. The US have been more dominant in the second half without unduly stretching Costa Rica \u2014 will Klinsmann try to force the issue with a flurry of late subs? Costa Rica get the next chance though, as Meneses overlaps and earns a corner of a deflection.Rodriguez comes on for Wallace before it can be taken. When it comes in Holden has to head it clear from under the bar with Johnson looking a little tentative. Another corner. Still USA 0-0 Costa Rica No subs as yet, but the Costa Rica bench is stirring, perhaps in reaciton to the still shaken Miller. Can the US take advantage of the temporary ten man opposition? No. They pass it back, turn the ball over and by the time of the next break in play for a free kick (Bedoya perhaps lucky not to see yellow as he goes in late on Diaz), Miller's back on. And now we have a sub. Miller coming out for Meneses. The replays of the Pemberton booking are showing and it does look as if he made a save (albeit one he didn't know much about) of a goalbound shot while well outside his box. Could easily have been red. Beasley's been quiet on the overlap this half, but now he chases a long ball over the top and keeps it in. The ball eventually crosses the box and bounces awkwardly in front of Miller and Bedoya. the latter's foot is high and catches Miller as he bravely heads clear. USA trying to play some first time balls in build up play now. It has a significant upside if it works, but obviously moves are prone to break down more often. A risk they ned to take if they want toe xtend their winning run to 8. Donovan duly twists and turns but can't find a clean opening. So an hour gone and Donovan and Wondolowski are both beginning to crop up more often in this game \u2014 this may be the crucial phase. The US lose a bit of momentum as Tejada cleverly draws a foul from Diskerud \u2014 who's sprinting in on him. Now Holden fouls Cunningham and gives a away a free kick in a dangerous position. Just left of center, 25 yards out. Borges curls it over the bar though. Oh, and Holden got booked. And it's still USA 0-0 Costa Rica ...Torres gets the fre kick up and down well and Pemberton can only parry into the path of the onrushing Donovan who rather hurries his shot and can only prod it towards the keeper. Good US pressure at the moment. Can they make it count? Wondo more involved in this half. Now he's found by a low cut back from Bedoya, but he gets under it and skies his shot. Hang on... ...Ooooooh... Pemberton charges out of his goal and is judged to have handled the ball outside the box. Just a yellow though, as there were defenders behind him. Could have been red with another referee. As it is, it's a free kick just to the right of the D... Now it's a US free kick some 30 yards out as Donovan is fouled. it's a little far out for a shot and not a great angle for a lobbed ball in. Donovan duly lobs the ball in and Wondolowski is just offside as he steps up to try and direct a header goalwards. The US attack again, but Donovan's ball wide to Torres is forced clear. Game very scrappy at the moment as Parkhurst and Cunningham clash. Both players are down and the Costa Rica players are lobbying for a card \u2014 of the \"yellow\" rather than \"get well soon\" variety, presumably... USA have a long throw opportunity from Diskerud that bounces awkwardly in front of Pemberton, who's barged by Wondolowski as he claims it. Pemberton rather milks his reaction much to the disgust of Wondolowski. Still USA 0-0 Costa Rica The US are trying to break down the resolute Costa Rican defense, but end up passing the ball around the back again as the second half eases into life verrrrrry slowly. We're off again. Klinsmann just talking about bringing on Castillo or Shea to try and get some joy down the flanks in the second half. Agree? disagree? Tweet your opinions to @KidWeil or email graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com, if you're the sort of person who insists on inserting ascii stick figures into your tactical breakdowns... So after this game Klinsmann is given 24 hours to bring up to four wild card selections into his squad. It's a new innovation for this year's Gold Cup. Not quite sure what I make of it, seeing as the subs in friendly games irritate me enough as it is, as a fairly hapless minute by minute blogger. Maybe if he only brought in players called Smith it could work. Well, a pretty even game, as we might have expected, though the US looked rattled in the opening sequence as their midfield looked a little less calibrated for the back foot than the front foot, as Costa Rica pressed forward. The US did well to settle and push back in the middle of the half, but could never quite consistently take control of the game and a lot of their attacks were against a pretty well set Costa Rican. Beasley looked intent at least going forward from left back, but equally vulnerable when Cunningham and Wallace countered. Johnson didn't have a lot to do in goal, but did what he had to competently. It's basically a fairly poised game between two teams currently fielding unfamiliar line ups. Surely we'll see Saborio at some point in the second half for Costa Rica. For the US it's interesting \u2014 their midfield has the look of one Klinsmann has changed to at half time in recent games, when he needed more aggression. What will he do in the second half here, having started with Diskerud and Holden? And will it be soundtracked by Mogwai? ...Donovan lofts the corner in, it's headed clear and that's half time. Half time thoughts in a moment. Sideways, sideways, sideways. It's the US backline in possession right now. Finally it's forced forward and Donovan gets clattered by Miller, but doesn't get a decision. US press around the edge of the box and suddenly Holden darts clear into the box, but his first touch lets him down and he's grateful to earn a corner... Diaz finds a little space on the left and sends in a low cross towards Arrieta, but only gets a throw off the US clearance. The game, which had briefly opened up during the middle of the first half, is looking compressed again as we head to the half. A little bit of chat back and forth between Holden and Cunningham after the latter is hauled down by the former and is all, like, \"Oh no you didn't\". And Holden is all like \" 'fraid so.\" The free kick is cleared. Beasley, who's worked hard all half, tries to battle his way through down the left, but can't find a way through and the US switch play to the other side. Costa Rica looking pretty organized at the back though and force the turnover. Half time looms and it's USA 0-0 Costa Rica Costa Rica box the US back in the final third then there's a slight break in play as Cunningham takes a ball to the face. Decent chance for the US as Torres and Goodson combine well on a low ball that has to be urgently cleared for a corner, then a minute later Wondolowski almost gets a header at the near post, but only earns another corner. This one causes panic in the six yard box, which ends when Wondolowski's backheel is grabbed gratefully by Pemberton after a threatening sequence for the USA. ...Junior Diaz sends a lovely looking bicycle kick flying over the crossbar, but not by enough that anyone's pointing and laughing at him. It was a decent attempt in a crowded box. In the next sequence Tejada looks angry after his body slam on a US player is adjudged worthy of a free kick. Arrieta races clear and pulls down a ball over the top but he's as offside as a Marco di Vaio picnic. Now Borges tries to thread a ball through the heart of the US defense but can't quite find the gap. A brief end to end flurry finishes with Costa Rica countering and earning a corner. Game opening up... Wondolowski battles to the byline on a flicked ball behind the defense, and forces a corner off the last man. Donovan sends in an outswinger that's met by an unmarked Bedoya, but his leap is slightly mistimed and he can't get power or direction on it and ends up flicking the ball wide of the far post. That was a decent chance he might have done better with. Still USA 0-0 Costa Rica though. Johnson takes a long throw into the US box but Goodson and Beasley combine to force it clear. Current possession stats USA 63% Costa Rica 37% \u2014 a lot of that USA possession has been lateral passes though (the sometime curse of Klinsmann's first half teams). Costa Rica haven't conceded a goal since that US goal when the sides last met. At the moment their back four isn't being tested that much, though the US have certainly been more dominant after the opening quarter of an hour. Not a lot of clear chances for either side though. Johnson has to save a fairly routine header from Cunningham that will nonetheless help his confidence. Carlos Johnson crossed the ball after tormenting Beasley - just a reminder for the US full backs not to over-commit against this side. Donovan and Bedoya work a little first time play off a Diskerud tthrough ball and earn a corner. Better from them - but the short corner is poor. It's lobbed back in from deep and Pemberton flaps at the ball, but Diaz helps him clear. Briefly Costa Rica have numbers breaking but the US retrieve and push up again. The pendulum of the game beginning to swing towards them right now. Or with them. Or despite them...they're doing better, basically. US creeping into this game a little now and Holden tries a long ball over the top that forces Pemberton to rush out and clear. Not a lot of rushing from the US though \u2014 understandable perhaps in this heat, but it's not going to trouble Costa rica if the rest of the game unfolds at this pace. USA 0-0 Costa Rica Wondolowski and Bedoya try to work a give and go on the edge of the Costa Rica box, but despite a couple of loose deflections they can't quite take advantage and we're back to midfield shapelessness. Bill McKenna (see Soundtrack of Summer, earlier) just tweeted that he was getting a little bored and suggesting the soundtrack of \"Crank It\" by Lil' Scrappy for this one. Personally think \"Lil' Scrappy\" is a pretty adequate description of what we've seen so far. So this will be that game where the US midfield needs to balance defense and attack, and they're currently being put under a lot of pressure by a fired up Costa Rica team. Beasley barges forward down the left again and beats two men, but his cross is too deep to reach anyone in a US shirt. He's been the most dangerous US player so far, though that's a pretty relative claim. Wallace, who's been lively for the Costa Ricans so far, faces up to his defender on the US left, and tries to open up for a cross, but Beasley (back on the field) is supported well and the US defense recover. Bedoya goes down rather easily under a challenge from Diaz, and looks for a US penalty on what's currently a rare attack, but the referee doesn't want to know. Diaz doesn't look thrilled at Bedoya's theatrical fall either. Beasley limping off a little groggily as the corner is headed clear at the near post by Goodson. Winner of this group (currently USA) faces El Salvador on Sunday. Second place faces Honduras. Both in Baltimore. Currently it's USA 0-0 Costa Rica and the US top the group. Diskerud picks up the ball wide right and tries to float a cross into the box but hits it over everyone and Costa Rica can come clear. Now a turnover gives Wallace half a glimpse of goal, but his shot is deflected wide of the far post. Beasley looks like he picked up a knock in the build up to that chance. Replays show Wallace's knee caught him in the back of the head as he ran through past the prone player. He's getting treatment now as we wait for the corner. US a little ponderous in clearing their lines as Costa Rica settle. Now Wallace twists and turns in the box and almost gets the better of Beasley, who momentarily loses sight of the ball. Wallace touches it out though before he can control it. More pressure than the US have faced in this tournament so far though. Goodson touches the ball back to give Johnson a touch and the US resume their attempts at pressing forward. Now Johnson has to make a clearance, after Goodson's back pass under pressure from Cunningham forces him to kick. He does it well enough. Now Costa Rica make a hash of a throw deep in US territory and Johnson will take a goal kick. USA go for route one early, with a couple of probing long balls to test a fairly resolute Costa Rican defense. Now Beasley does some good work down the left and his first cross is blocked, but he scraps well to get the rebound \u2014 only to hook his attempted shot tamely wide of the post. We kick off in a cool 90 degrees. Not a snowball in sight. USA get us underway and move the ball around their back line. Himno Nacional de Costa Rica is a fairly jaunty tune and belted out enthusiastically by an impressive Costa Rican contingent. Then a big rendition of the Star Spangled Banner rings out \u2014 replete with shots of American Outlaws, Jurgen Klinsmann in a stripey t-shirt and Beasley looking faintly nervous in a \"did I leave the gas on?\" kind of way... And now we're ready for kickoff. Next word you read will be \"PEEP\". So right before this game the crowd were treated to a rather exciting climax to the Cuba vs Belize game when the Cubans scored two late goals to win 4-0 and advance to the quarter finals on goal difference, by virtue of that final goal taking them past Martinique. They may be one of two teams who qualified as best third place finishers from an initial field of twelve, but they celebrated like they\u2019d won the whole thing. Rather fun it was too. Anyway, the teams are out of the tunnel now and the anthems are being sung lustily, so we should be underway in a few minutes. ...with a totally impartial analysis of Sean Johnson: Certainly be nice for him to put some international distance between himself and last year's disastrous Olympic qualifying campaign. And yes, he has been solid this year in league play. USA: Johnson; Parkhurst, Orozco-Fiscal, Goodson, Beasley, Bedoya, Holden, Diskerud, Torres, Wondolowski, Donovan Costa Rica: Pemberton; Miller, Gonzalez, Umana, Wallace, Borges, Cunningham, Diaz, Johnson, Tejeda, Granados, Arrieta Big news there is Diskerud and Holden starting together in midfield \u2014 after their barnstorming performance in the tune-up game against Guatemala. An aggressive line up in that regard. Another eyebrow-raiser is the fact that Sean Johnson gets the start in goal. The usual sprinkling of MLS suspects starts for Costa Rica \u2014 the main exception being Saborio. You may have noticed that in the preamble I used the concacaf highlights for the video clip, which replace excited announcer yelping with martial music (if you haven't watched it, do so now \u2014 I'll wait).This is not so much a commentary on Fox\u2019s job on the commentary so far, as a nod to my belief that all games should be soundtracked live, preferably by marching band. We could give the color announcer a triangle to ding now and again when a forward drifts too wide and doesn\u2019t \u201coffer himself\u201d, but other than that, just pure urgent, musical hints that \u201csomething is going on\u201d seems like the sensible way forward to me \u2014 not least since it avoids discussion over accents and the football/soccer debate and goes straight for the common global language of Hollywood Armageddon. I am open to soundtrack suggestions at @KidWeil and graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com And right on cue, Twitter speaks: Strictly a soundtrack decision on Johnson by Klinsmann. On that note, line ups in a sec... The Ticos have labored so far in this tournament - taking their sweet time to make any progress against Cuba, before easing ahead of them in the final quarter of the game in Portland. And then they almost experienced an almighty shock against Belize \u2014 needing an own goal and a last minute clearance off their own line to beat the opponents the US had put six past. And this from a near full strength squad featuring the likes of Saborio, Arrieta et al. That said, the farce in Colorado should be all the inspiration the Costa Rica team needs tonight. Lest we forget... So notwithstanding the opposition (and in fairness the run does include Germany, as well as Belize and Cuba) the USA winning streak now stands at seven games, which matches a team record the US set six years ago (when funnily enough they won all their games en route to claiming their last Gold Cup title). They\u2019ve been a little static at times in the past few games, but once the scoring floodgates have opened they\u2019ve stayed open, with 16 goals in three games and all sorts of new names on the scoresheet. This time ten days ago Chris Wondolowski hadn\u2019t scored an international goal. Now he has six and a browser tab open to an Amazon page on Brazilian guidebooks. But others have been chipping in as well, not least promising young trialist Landon Donovan, who\u2019s been very proactive in changing the dynamics of each of the last few games, and in doing so surely meeting just about every aspect of Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s \u201cImpress me\u201d brief. Of those who need to get going on that task, Brek Shea was pretty awful against Cuba, but I\u2019m pretty awful at the best of times and nobody took a bone out of my foot last year. Shea\u2019s big problem perhaps is that he\u2019s not back to the pre-injury level he was at in 2011, and is both failing to impress his international coach and not present for a new club coach taking pre-season training at Stoke. It\u2019s a difficult position for him, but as best he can he needs to seize the day right now. Arguably, so too does Kyle Beckerman, who is a player who draws a lot of criticism for his international showings, often in comparison to the non like-for-like replacements for him in the center of the park. So the US start with him sitting in front of the defense, the play looks slow and they struggle to break down bunkering opponents, then Mix Diskerud or Stuart Holden come on and suddenly everything seems more dynamic and peppy and shots are raining in from outside the box and everyone tweets about how slow Beckerman is. Which is all rather unfair, given that we\u2019ve yet to see this particular bunch of US players consistently on the back foot in this tournament against comparable opponents, so the upside of Diskerud/Holden et al has not been significantly countered by watching them in a more defensive stance. That said, Beckerman, while being trustworthy at his job, has yet to truly convince that he can go above and beyond the basic brief, and this must surely represent his main chance to do that. Welcome to the Weather Bowl \u2014 an ongoing series of extreme conditions encounters between USA and Costa Rica. After the snow globe in Colorado earlier this year, and before a return World Cup qualifier in Costa Rica that rumors indicate is scheduled to be played in an underwater car park, these two are meeting this evening in the stifling midsummer heat and humidity of Rentschler Stadium, Connecticut. As well as bragging rights over whose hair looks most awesome in a variety of conditions (and let\u2019s face it, Jermaine Jones\u2019s SnoFro wins), tonight is the final group game in each team\u2019s Gold Cup round robin stage. Both have already qualified for the quarter finals this weekend after getting by the combined might of Belize and Cuba in their opening two games, and the interest in tonight\u2019s game is partly in who will top the group and get a favorable quarter final draw. But it's also a game where we may get a more realistic assessment if this US squad. Despite Cuba taking a lead in the second game and a couple of slightly ponderous first half displays, 6-1 vs Belize and 4-1 vs Cuba were not unreflective scorelines, and the US can expect a tougher game against Costa Rica. Certainly Jurgen Klinsmann seems to think so: \u201cEverybody has respect for Belize and Cuba, but the benchmark for us starts with Costa Rica,\u201d he twinkled yesterday, possibly in an ill-advised polo shirt. Plenty of subplots here: Will Chris \u201cRogue W\u201d Wondolowski keep scoring? Will Landon \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tranger\u201d Donovan keep scoring/assisting? Will Stuart \u201cthe knee\u201d Holden continue his comeback apace? Will Brek Shea? Of course these are minor distractions compared to wondering just what Roy Miller could come up with for Costa Rica (basically, anything...). Never mind Saborio and Arrieta, Miller is the Tico to watch, usually through your fingers. I\u2019l be back shortly with more build up and team news. In the meantime get your thoughts and rants coming in to @KidWeil or graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com and catch up with what happened on Saturday when the USA played Cuba (and no, the second choice US line up is not due to Howard, Dempsey, Bradley, Altidore et al defecting en masse before the game...)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
