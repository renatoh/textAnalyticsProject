What better way to entertain the kids this half term than a trip to a chocolate factory and to one of Europe's leading theme parks. Cologne is home to both of these and there are now plenty of ways to get there: Germanwings (germanwings.com) from Edinburgh, Gatwick and Stansted; Hapag Lloyd Express (hlx.com) from Coventry, Manchester and Newcastle; EasyJet (easyjet.com) from East Midlands, Liverpool, Gatwick. German Travel Centre (020 8429 2900; german-travel-uk.com) can set up flights and hotels. Where to stay German Travel Centre has a two-night package at the The Maritim Hotel K\u00f6ln from \u00a3250pp, based on a family of four sharing two adjoining twin rooms, and flights from London. What to see At Cologne's Stollwerck Chocolate Museum (schokoladenmuseum.de) you'll walk through forests of cocoa trees, watch chocs being produced and drink from a chocolate fountain. Germany's answer to Disney World, Phantasialand (phantasialand.de), above, is 15km outside the city, taking visitors around the world and through time, from the wild west and Chinatown to a space centre. Adults, \u00a316.60, children \u00a313.20, and children less than a metre tall go free. Where to eat Em Kr\u00fctzche (00 49 221 258 0839; emkruetzche.de), near the cathedral, serves excellent traditional grub and is child-friendly too. Or try Chicago Steakhouse (Am Hof 20-26, 00 49 221 257 8541) or Maggiano's for Italian and Mexican (Am Hof 20-26, 00 49 221 925 3434). Big night out Most of the city's brewery restaurants have a fun, informal atmosphere, good value food, and special chairs and menu options for children. Try Br\u00e4uhaus Peters (M\u00fchlengasse 1, 00 49 221 257 3950; peters-brauhaus.de) or Br\u00e4uhaus Fr\u00fch am Dom, Am Hof 12-14, 00 49 221 261 3211; frueh.de)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
