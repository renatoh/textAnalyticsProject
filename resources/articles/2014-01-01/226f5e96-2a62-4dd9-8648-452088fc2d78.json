Their chairman, Chris Nenzani, has released an open letter to Alan Isaac, the president of the International Cricket Council, stating that the proposal from the ICC's Financial and Commercial Affairs Committee, which was to be considered at a board meeting in Dubai the week after next, is \"fundamentally flawed\". \"Without addressing the merits of the proposal insofar as it concerns constitutional amendments and changes to ICC competitions, these proposals should first be referred to the relevant ICC committees or sub-committees for proper consideration and to make recommendations to the ICC Board,\" Nenzani argues. \"Although there is nothing to prevent a review of the ICC funding model or finances, the proposal self-evidently is inextricably tied up with a fundamental restructuring of the ICC, which has far-reaching constitutional implications. \"The draft proposal is, therefore, fundamentally flawed as regards the process and, therefore, in breach of the ICC Constitution. In the circumstances we propose that the draft proposal be withdrawn immediately given that the proper procedures have not been followed. \"In our respectful opinion, a more considered, inclusive/consultative, and properly Constitutionally-ordained approach is required.\" South Africa would be the most obvious losers under the proposals, with their position at the top of the ICC's world Test rankings counting for little when it comes to dividing power and money in the world game. Perhaps significantly their relations with India have nose-dived since Haroon Lorgat, former chief executive of the game's global governing body, became head of Cricket South Africa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
