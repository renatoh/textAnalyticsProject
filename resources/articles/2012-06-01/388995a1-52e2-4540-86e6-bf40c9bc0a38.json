She was five years old, and captivated. Her librarian mother had, until then, been reading her more obvious children's fare: Goodnight Moon, The Runaway Bunny. But when she began reading Homer's ancient, epic poem \u2013 omitting some of the gorier parts \u2013 she opened up a new perspective for her daughter. A passport to an adult world. \"I thought, 'Wow, this is what real life is like,'\" says Miller. She adjusts her glasses, and laughs. \"That might sound funny, given that the story is full of gods. But the emotions, the striving, the grief. It was so engaging.\" And it started with that intriguing line: \"Sing, goddess, of the terrible rage of Achilles.\" At the heart of Homer's story, his tale of a turbulent period in the 10th and final year of the Trojan war, is the exceptional Greek warrior Achilles, half-man, half-god. It is Achilles's terrible pride that leads him to withdraw from battle, after an insult from Greek leader Agamemnon; there are subsequently horrendous losses among the troops in the Greek army. And it is Achilles' overwhelming grief and wrath at the death of his close friend Patroclus that drives him back to the battlefield, to enact a revenge that will end with the body of Hector \u2013 the Trojan warrior who killed his friend \u2013 being dragged behind his chariot. Miller was obsessed with Achilles's story, she says, \"and in particular, this terrible, grief-stricken, devastated reaction to losing Patroclus. That was the moment I kept returning to, because I wanted to understand it. Patroclus doesn't appear very much in The Iliad. He's elusive. A mystery, really. And so I wanted to explore the question: who is this man who means so much to Achilles?\" The result is her lively first novel, The Song of Achilles, which was this week awarded the Orange prize for fiction. We meet just after the announcement. Miller, still blinking and beaming, is \"floating on endorphins\", she says. Her achievement is historic. This is the last year of the Orange prize, after the mobile phone company withdrew sponsorship, a decision announced unexpectedly last week. And while Miller says she's hugely honoured to win, she's also concerned and hopeful the award for women's literature will continue. (There have been rumours that Apple might take over.) On a strong shortlist, including Ann Patchett, Anne Enright, Cynthia Ozick and Esi Edugyan, Miller's novel was a slightly surprising winner. The Song of Achilles is highly enjoyable, and full of scholarship, but also occasionally pulpy. It roams back some years before the start of the Trojan war, to tell the story of the friendship between Patroclus and Achilles, and is suffused with battles and yearning, swords, snakes and sex, the latter described in wonderfully, sometimes hilariously misty language. In Miller's story, Patroclus is born a prince, but is exiled by his father, aged 10, after he accidentally kills a boy who has been bullying him. Arriving at the court of King Peleus, he soon becomes the faithful friend of the king's son, Achilles, and begins developing romantic feelings towards him. These are thwarted, at first, by Achilles's mother, the sea-nymph and goddess Thetis, who has an alarming ability to see, in literal terms, exactly what's going on between the boys at any given time. Imagine the worst parent you could possibly have on your case as a teenage suitor, and multiply ad infinitum. But when Achilles and Patroclus head into the mountains to be schooled by centaur Chiron (this is the sort of story where half-man, half-horses stroll nonchalantly across the page), it turns out Thetis can't see them there. The boys' love affair begins. A good deal of shivering, stripping, arching, gasping and swelling occurs, before the inevitable \"spurt of his warmth\". Some typical lines: \"He stroked me gently, as though smoothing finest cloth, and my hips lifted to his touch. I pulled him to me, and trembled and trembled. He was trembling, too. He sounded as though he had been running far and fast.\" One of Miller's ex-boyfriends described her book as \"Homeric fan fiction\", which is much too harsh \u2013 but you can see what he meant. The author and critic Daniel Mendelsohn wrote in the New York Times that the book \"has the head of a young adult novel, the body of the Iliad, and the hindquarters of Barbara Cartland\". But on the whole, the book has had excellent reviews, and it is the more soapy qualities that seem likely to make it a major hit. It's a narrative with appeal to young and old, men and women, readers of both commercial and literary fiction. Even before it was announced as the winner, it was the biggest-selling book on this year's shortlist. Miller is 33, and started the book in her early 20s, in the final year of her undergraduate degree in Latin and Ancient Greek at Brown University, Rhode Island. A friend had asked her to co-direct a production of Troilus and Cressida, which features a scene where Patroclus dies and Achilles is devastated. \"Seeing that moment on stage,\" she says, \"I just thought: I want to do more. As soon as the play was over, almost in a trance, I sat down in front of the computer, and started writing Patroclus's story.\" Everything in her life had led her to that desk: years spent studying classics, obsessing over mythology, reading voraciously, writing prolifically. As a child, growing up in New York in the early 1980s, she would visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art with her mother, who gave her the choice of what to see. \"I would always just say: 'Well, we're either doing Greek, Roman or Egyptian.' We never got to see anything else. Every now and then, I would say: 'Well, OK, we can look at the armour.'\" What a treat! \"Yes! I was a totally tyrannical pain.\" She was an exceptionally obedient child, she says; her only real act of rebellion being to continue scribbling down stories while the rest of the pupils were obeying teacher's orders to copy theirs out in their neatest handwriting. All the while she was reading, \"literally everything I could get my hands on \u2013 from stuff that was so over my head, to complete trash. You know, the cereal box.\" She started learning Latin when she was 11, and the first time she translated a sentence, \"I was just so excited!\" Did her friends share this passion? She doubles over, laughing. \"You're sensing I was little bit of a nerd, aren't you? I was definitely on the far end of the excitement spectrum.\" She had plenty of knowledge when she started writing then, but also began searching for every reference she could find to Patroclus in ancient literature. The idea was for the story to stay as close to the original myths as possible. It wasn't quick work. The book took 10 years to write, the same period as the Trojan war, and became such a lengthy endeavour that friends and family, \"pretty much stopped asking me about it\". While she was writing it she completed her MA in Latin and Ancient Greek, and became a high school teacher in those subjects. \"I certainly thought: am I really going to finish this novel? What am I doing? This is my secret life. I love teaching, I'm happy teaching \u2013 but I just couldn't let their story alone. I felt so passionate about the characters that every time I thought, 'I can't do this' I would go back again and say, 'No, I can't. I need to. I owe it to them.\" The more she thought about Patroclus, \"the more intensely moved I was\". He's referred to in The Iliad as gentle, \"and that really jumped out at me, because gentleness was not a common quality of these ancient Greek heroes. And then I thought, we're in this culture of intense excellence, where being the best was so important, and he was OK with Achilles being the best, and being his companion and being in his shadow. That doesn't bother him, so again, that made him extraordinary. I really thought: I want to give this amazing man his voice.\" Five years in, she had finished the book \u2013 then scrapped it, starting again from scratch. Was that frightening? \"Yes,\" she laughs. \"But it all had to go.\" There have long been intimations that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers; a fragment of a play by Aeschylus mentions their \"frequent kisses\". \"I think there have been many people who have taken them as close companions,\" says Miller, \"but looking at the way Achilles mourns, how incredibly deeply and sensually \u2013 holding the dead body all night, wanting their ashes put together \u2013 that seems to say something beyond [friendship] to me\". A gay rights message is inherent in the novel, she says. \"I would never presume to speak for gay men, but for me, the love story between these two men was the heart of the story ... and the turning point of The Iliad. I wanted to really honour that.\" She was nervous when showing it to her two mentors at Brown, \"worried that maybe the classics police would be after me; that they would feel I was profaning it, because it's a text I love so much\". Thankfully they, and the majority of other scholars who have contacted her, have been positive. The novel's success comes at a moment when The Iliad's popularity seems as strong \u2013 perhaps stronger \u2013 than ever. In an article in the London Review of Books earlier this year, the historian Edward Luttwak noted he had been looking for a translation at San Francisco airport, and found 10 copies of different versions of the poem. The poet Alice Oswald's recent book Memorial was inspired by The Iliad, as was David Malouf's novel Ransom; in March a new stage adaptation opened in New York. One reason for the poem's current popularity, in the US and UK, Miller suspects, is our own extended conflicts overseas. \"This is a poem about war, and a long war,\" she says. \"It's about [the questions]: are our leaders leading us astray, can we trust them, are they selfish, what about the common soldiers and people who are suffering on the ground? So I think all of that is speaking to our cultural moment ... We have soldiers who are coming back with post-traumatic stress disorder, which is something Homer and the ancients understood intimately: the experience of soldiers and their suffering. So it's all just very powerful. And it's a testament to how insightful the work is that we can look to it and still find new resonance.\" Miller lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her partner, Nathaniel, and is working on her second novel, based on The Odyssey. She's still \"in the blundering phase,\" she says, \"but that's a very important phase! I'm a very slow writer.\" Still, she would like to complete it in less than a decade. She's just tutoring at the moment, rather than being in the classroom, but hopes to find a way to teach and write part-time. I ask which Greek stories she'd assign a reluctant student, and she talks through options, including Euripides' The Bacchae, \"nice and bloodthirsty, but also gripping\". The truth is, she'd do well to set them her own. Full of vim, scholarly rigour and sex, few versions of Greek myth look set to send so many people careering so excitedly back to those original stories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
