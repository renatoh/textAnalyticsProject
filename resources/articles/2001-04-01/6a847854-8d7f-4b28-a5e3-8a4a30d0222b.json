It is now not uncommon to find smoked emu prosciutto, witchetty grub soup, buffalo and croc on the menu. Kangaroo Tail Soup This recipe is a classic. If you have difficulty locating kangaroo meat in your local supermarket you can substitute oxtail to good effect. Serves 8-10. 2.5 kg of Kangaroo tail (or oxtails), browned 2 onions, diced 2 carrots, diced 2 celery stalks with leaves, diced 3 cloves of garlic, crushed 2 and a half cups of dry white wine 1/2 a cup of port 1/2 a bunch of fresh thyme 2 parsley storks or 1 medium parsnip 1 and a half cups of tomato paste 5 and a half quarts of beef stock 4 cups of tomato pur\u00e9e 2 tbsps salt 2 tbsps pepper olive oil Brown the meat in the oven at 4500, turning once. Saut\u00e9 the onion, carrot, celery and garlic in olive oil. Add port and red wine and bring to the boil. Then add the tomato paste and parsley (or parsnip) tied together with the thyme. Leave to reduce. Once it is half the volume add the browned meat along with the stock, tomato pur\u00e9e, salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer for 90 minutes. Strain, keeping the meat to add later, and put it in the fridge until it is cold enough to scoop the fat off the top and throw away. Reheat, add meat and serve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
