The 20-year-old departed Anfield in the summer in acrimonious circumstances after agitating publicly for a move. Sterling\u2019s agent, Aidy Ward, claimed his client would not re-sign for Liverpool for \u201c\u00a3900,000 a week\u201d and the player stated that he would not go on the club\u2019s pre-season tour. Liverpool\u2019s visit for Saturday\u2019s late kick-off is the first time Sterling will play against them. He can expect a hostile reception from the travelling support, though Pellegrini is unconcerned about offering advice regarding this. \u201cNot exactly because all the boos and different things from the fans are out of the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing is between the players on the pitch. There is a lot of intensity in these games. We know we are playing for very important points so any mistake could result in an unnecessary yellow card or an unnecessary foul that could lead to a penalty.\u201d Sterling said he wanted to leave Liverpool to become a better player. Pellegrini would not be drawn on whether the forward could have done this by remaining at Anfield. \u201cIt is so difficult to know what will happen in the future if he had chosen another path at another club,\u201d the manager said. \u201cAll I know is that playing here with David Silva, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Yaya Tour\u00e9, he will improve. \u201cHe has very important potential as a young player. Liverpool also have very good players so if he had stayed he may well have improved there. But sometimes it doesn\u2019t depend on the club, it depends more on the player.\u201d James Milner is set to line up against City having made the opposite move to Sterling last summer but is unlikely to be poorly received at the Etihad. Ag\u00fcero is fit to start following the hamstring injury that has caused him to miss the past seven City matches. \u201cIt will be difficult because he has gone so many days without playing,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is ready to play 90 minutes or to play two or three games in a week. It is important for Sergio to evaluate during the game how many minutes he feels he can play. But he must start in this game because we don\u2019t have [Wilfried] Bony and it is important for the team to have Sergio.\u201d Ag\u00fcero has suffered a catalogue of hamstring injuries at City. Pellegrini, asked if this was an issue that would have to be managed from now on, said: \u201cWe always try to manage those injuries, but it is very difficult to manage. It is not only in our team. A lot of teams have important players injured for different reasons because the intensity is too high or they play too many games.\u201d Silva is not fit to face Liverpool because of an ankle problem and Vincent Kompany is again ruled out due to his latest calf injury. Pellegrini said he was unsure for how long the captain would be unavailable. \u201cI am hoping that next week he will be fit but the calf is such a difficult muscle you never know how much [time] he needs.\u201d Silva, like Ag\u00fcero, has missed the past seven matches for City. Pellegrini added: \u201cIt\u2019s a long injury because it\u2019s not a muscle injury. It\u2019s an ankle and for different reasons he can\u2019t be 100% fit. If a player is not comfortable I think that he can\u2019t play but he\u2019s a player that we need, especially now that we don\u2019t have Samir Nasri for four or five months. I hope it\u2019s the same as with Vincent, that next week he can be OK.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
