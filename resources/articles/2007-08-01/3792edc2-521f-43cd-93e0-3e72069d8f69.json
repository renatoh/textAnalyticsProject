Another 22 wickets fell yesterday, six of them to Harbhajan Singh, giving him 11 for 91 in the match. With Kent's off-spinner James Tredwell also finishing with eight yesterday, fingers will point at the St Lawrence ground pitch that allowed lateral movement almost from the start. Harbhajan polished off the tail as Kent were dismissed for 171, leaving Surrey with a target of 107 off a maximum of 30 overs. Fourteen in, with Surrey at 47 for three, nerves were jangling before Harbhajan joined Mark Ramprakash. They got within touching distance until Ramprakash was stumped for 28 and, with 15 still needed, Harbhajan's 22-ball innings of 29 also ended attempting a sixth boundary. James Benning finally won it with a six over long-on. Adam Shantry's impact on championship cricket has not been startling since he made his competition debut four years ago but the 24-year-old left-arm medium-pacer set Warwickshire on their way to a position of unexpected dominance by the end of a fascinating day against the champions, Sussex The irony, of course, is that the Bears had no intention of including Shantry before being informed half-an-hour before the match started on Wednesday morning that their new signing Nayan Doshi was ineligible. After a first, gently unthreatening over from the Sea End, Shantry's original status of 12th man appeared to have been eminently justified but, in his second, the ball started to swing. His first wicket might have been something of a gift - Richard Montgomerie's reaction when he turned a ball off his legs straight into the hands of leg gully was that of a man who had not realised the fielder was there - but the second, that of the left-handed Michael Yardy caught behind, was earned with a real beauty. He finished with four for 31 in Sussex's total of 168 and could have claimed five had the Sussex captain, Chris Adams, not been dropped off his bowling. Warwickshire's captain, Darren Maddy, wary perhaps of facing Mushtaq Ahmed and Saqlain Mushtaq on a dry, final-day wicket, decided not to enforce the follow-on and his side were 77 for two at the close of play, 342 ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
