In a report on the eve of the government's comprehensive spending review, ONE said UK official development assistance (ODA) to the continent fell by 7.4% to \u00a33.41bn in 2012. Sub-Saharan Africa saw an even sharper drop of 9.8% to \u00a33.07bn. \"The disproportionate drop in aid to Africa and sub-Saharan Africa is especially concerning given the UK's commitment to the region,\" said ONE, which attributed the fall to a decline in the UK's multilateral contributions of \u00a3412m, or 12%, last year. The comprehensive spending review is expected to cut government spending by \u00a311.5bn in 2015-16. According to ONE, the Department for International Development (DfID) is likely to see a drop in the proportion of UK aid for which it is responsible, with the Foreign Office, Home Office and Ministry of Defence seeing an increase taking their share above 10%. However, given chancellor George Osborne's budget statement in March, UK aid spending is expected to significantly increase, following a decline to \u00a38.56bn in 2012. Although aid to Africa dropped disproportionately last year, the UK still devotes the largest share of its ODA to the region. In 2004-11, the five largest recipients of UK aid in sub-Saharan Africa were Nigeria, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Sudan. DfID pointed out that the proportion of direct support (bilateral aid) it gives to Africa has remained steady. The share of DfID's bilateral ODA to Africa will rise to \u00a32.3bn this year \u2013 about a quarter of the department's total aid. In terms of global ODA, ONE found Africa disproportionately affected by the drop in total flows in the past two years. From its peak in 2010, ODA fell by 2.2% in 2011 to \u00a380bn and by a further 3.1% to \u00a377.5bn in 2012. Aid to Africa last year declined by 6.7% to \u00a326.9bn after regular increases since 2004. In total, 16 of the 24 countries in the development assistance committee (DAC) club of donors reduced aid to Africa in 2012, including 14 of the 15 EU DAC members. Countries that increased aid to Africa, however, include South Korea (up by 45.4%), Australia (20.7%), the US (12.8%) and Canada (9.6%). \"Many sub-Saharan African countries have made dramatic progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) but the region still requires increased financing from both domestic and donor budgets to help reach the 2015 MDG targets, and to achieve even more ambitious post-2015 goals,\" said ONE."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
