Terry strained the ligaments in the joint late on in the draw with Swansea City eight days ago and, having missed the 2-1 home defeat by Liverpool, will also sit out the League Cup tie at Leicester City on Tuesday. But the 35-year-old has played a part in full training with his team-mates at Cobham and, while he will be absent at the King Power stadium, he is on target to return to the side at the Emirates stadium. \u201cJohn is recovering,\u201d Conte said. \u201cI saw him outside today and he is recovering. After this game [against Leicester] we\u2019ll see his physical condition. It\u2019s a big week because we face two very strong teams. Leicester won the title last season and, this season, they\u2019ve shown they are a very good team, also in the Champions League. Arsenal are a great team that will fight for the title so it\u2019s a big week but we are ready. We know we have to work to improve because I know we can improve a lot, this is important.\u201d Conte made clear his frustrations post-match on Friday after watching too many of his players revert to last season\u2019s bad habits as Liverpool won at Stamford Bridge. Those sentiments are understood to have been shared by the club\u2019s hierarchy, with the owner Roman Abramovich having witnessed the defeat first-hand from his box up in the west stand. He left the ground in the small hours of Saturday morning still digesting the loss. Yet the manager, who will hand the \u00a320m left-back Marcos Alonso a debut at Leicester, has been encouraged by his squad\u2019s reaction in training in the period since. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good response,\u201d he told Chelsea TV. \u201cWe are disappointed about the defeat against Liverpool because we gave away two goals and it was our first defeat of the season, but during training I\u2019ve seen the right intensity, the right commitment from the players and, now, we have a very tough game against Leicester. We are ready. \u201cThe spirit is good because we analysed the game together and we\u2019ve seen the positive things and the bad things. It\u2019s important to restart and find a good spirit. \u201cI have given the players the same message that I gave after the game: that when you concede two goals in this way \u2013 after a free-kick and throw-in \u2013 we must pay attention in every moment of the game. You must pay attention to details because details change results.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
