When we moved in 10 years ago, the empty room had no history that we knew of. Our two tiny organisations - the Alliance for Inclusive Education and Parents for Inclusion - had only our commitment to children, a small grant, and a few pieces of second-hand office furniture. Very few people had heard of inclusive education. Even fewer had heard of us. Yet over 10 years, this partnership between disabled people and parents of disabled children has touched thousands. We have brought about a change in national policy. Children have experienced something new - the chance to be educated in mainstream schools, even children with severe impairments who would normally have been educated in a separate and unequal special school system. We were able to take out a lease on a second unit, our own inclusion centre. In four years, several thousand people have come through our doors to think with us about how to build a truly inclusive education system. The accessibility of the building, its large car park, its nearness to rail, bus and underground, have made it a place in which disabled people can work with ease. So it is with great sorrow that we are stripping the walls of photos, as the search for smaller, cheaper premises becomes urgent. Why has the struggle become harder? Inclusive education is supposedly the accepted policy of the government, and one would have expected that organisations like ours would by now be fully supported. But this is not the case. There are almost no sources of core funding for user-led organisations. Traditional sources of money for disabled children are aimed at separate projects, segregated education. Our mes sage - that children do better when they live and learn together - is challenging to many, unwelcome to some. Our bids often fail. Government funds are all aimed at short-term projects. Only if we can raise the core funding can we be considered competent enough to apply for the costs of a project. Even the Community Fund seems to have become just one more source of short-term, project-based funding for organisations that do not challenge government policy. Both our organisations failed our assessments: Parents for Inclusion because it had not been able to make a strong enough case that the application was for new work, and my organisation, Alliance for Inclusive Education, because our aims include campaigning to change the law. Other grass-roots organisations with the same aim have suffered the same fate. The reality is that the state, through grant-aided schools including special schools, still pours millions of pounds into segregated education. It also directs many millions of pounds into charitable organisations that provide specialist independent schools and colleges for disabled children. Scope alone has a budget of \u00a361m to educate fewer than 400 children. There is state funding for children with special needs within mainstream schools, but this has not risen in proportion to the current legal entitlement of every child whose parents wish it to be educated in a mainstream school. At the same time, LEAs such as Kent and Bath are justifying their investment in building new multimillion-pound special schools by using the argument that a segregated school can be part of an inclusive system. There are only four big national voluntary organisations working full-time towards this change. Between us, we can afford only 16 full-time posts and share an annual income of less than \u00a31m. Most of this comes from a handful of trusts on which we are unhealthily dependent (a change of policy of just one threatened the survival of us all), as well as our own publications, membership fees and donations. Those of us whose lives are affected by discrimination need direct support - including financial - to challenge prejudice and inertia, the structural barriers to inclusion, the unawareness by which we are surrounded. We need a degree of security for our staff. We need to meet running costs. These are fundamental if we are to use our time and energy to do our work rather than fight for survival. If these needs are not recognised, inclusion will continue to be no more than a dream for most young people. But perhaps that is the intention. \u00b7 The writer is director of the Alliance for Inclusive Education, which campaigns for the right of all children to be educated in properly resourced mainstream schools. www.allfie.org.uk Parents for Inclusion: www.parentsforinclusion.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
