Earlier this year it emerged that Hague had known for a decade that Ashcroft was only planning to pay tax on his UK income despite an earlier commitment that Ashcroft would pay \"tens of millions\" in tax. The Lib Dems made much of the running against the Tory party during this story. Hague's Labour predecessor, David Miliband, came very close to saying he wasn't fit to hold the office of foreign secretary. Hague's return to cabinet \u2013 he was Welsh secretary in John Major's last cabinet \u2013 comes nine years after he resigned as Tory leader, fully expecting his career in frontline politics was over. But David Cameron persuaded him to come back as shadow foreign secretary and has hugged him close, calling Hague his \"deputy in all but name\". Many believe the Ashcroft saga damaged Hague and the leadership in the eyes of the backbenchers. More generally Hague's handling of his brief when Tory shadow foreign secretary is likely to cause a problem for some Lib Dems who have led much of the opposition to the Tories as they struck new relationships in Europe. Cameron withdrew his MEPs from the centre-right grouping and set up a new one in which his allies include MEPs from eastern European countries. Nick Clegg denounced them as \"nutters and xenophobes\" in one of the TV debates during the campaign. Yesterday Tory government sources said the deal that had been hammered out between the Lib Dems and Tories would ensure no entry to the euro, and no transfer of powers to the EU without a referendum. The Lib Dems might not feel as short-changed as first appears since they have long wanted a referendum which they think will enable them to demonstrate they can increase europhilia in the UK. And though Clegg has been avowedly in favour of joining the euro, in the TV debates he conceded that it would not have been right to have joined up five years ago when it was on the cards and tests would still have to be met."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
