Adam Ingram, the armed forces minister, said in a Commons written reply that 261 had been killed in action. He told the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, a further 141 had been wounded in action. Mr Ingram warned that the figures were \"not an accurate estimate\" of Iraqi casualties because they were based on the \"subjective impression\" of troops involved in incidents. \"There is no way of checking these impressions since UK forces do not risk their own lives to ascertain how many casualties they have caused hostile forces, and Iraqi casualties are frequently withdrawn from the area,\" he said. In another written reply, Mr Ingram said 10 soldiers were under investigation with a view to possible prosecution over incidents in which Iraqi nationals were alleged to have been killed or injured. \"To date, these soldiers have not been charged with any offence,\" he said. The Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, also revealed details of Britons killed in Iraq while working as contractors. In a written reply to Sir Menzies Campbell, he said: \"From our consular records, we are aware of at least 21 British nationals who have been killed in Iraq since March 2003 while working as private military or security contractors. \"However, this figure is not definitive as our records do not, as a formality, include details of employers of those British nationals who die abroad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
