Following his side's 1-1 draw with Blackburn at Loftus Road, the Queens Park Rangers manager blamed DJ Campbell's \"stupid boots\" for the broken metatarsal that will keep the forward out of action for eight weeks. \"I think it is these stupid boots, they're like carpet slippers,\" raged Warnock of the injury that prevented him picking Campbell for the visit of Steve Kean's side. But given Campbell had, prior to Saturday, started only once for QPR this season, his absence was hardly a body blow for the Londoners. Ryan saves his privates Ryan Giggs, eh, he just cannot help protecting himself. The Welshman's latest attempt at self-preservation came in Manchester United's draw at Liverpool on Saturday, as he helpfully moved himself and his private parts out of the way so Steven Gerrard could open the scoring at Anfield with a low free-kick. What a decent chap he is. McKenzie makes a fist of it Step aside Paolo Di Canio. The Italian may once have shoved a referee but did he ever punch one, like Redditch United forward Josh McKenzie did during his side's weekend visit to Chesham? The strike led to the game being abandoned and McKenzie being sacked by his club and then arrested by police. Not one of his better days then. Goal of the weekend Seb Larsson, Arsenal v Sunderland The Swedish midfielder stunned his former club with a wonderful free-kick. From a central spot 25 yards away from goal, Larsson ran left to right before whipping the ball over the wall and beyond the reach of Wojciech Szczesny. Statistics of the weekend 7 Consecutive league matches in which Chelsea have failed to keep a clean sheet. Their last came in the goalless opening-day draw with Stoke City. 8 Fixtures Newcastle United have completed this season without suffering defeat, making it the club's best start to a campaign since 1994. 27 Goals scored by Manchester City after their first eight games of the season. A joint Premier League-record, alongside Arsenal's total from the 2009-10 season. Meanwhile \u2026 in Egypt Given the way he performed for their clubs, Tottenham Hotspur, Middlesbrough, Wigan Athletic and West Ham United fans would probably like nothing more than seeing Mido locked up. Well now they have their wish. The occasionally deadly, often podgy striker has been jailed for a week for taking part in an assualt on three students in Cairo along with a team-mate from Egyptian giants Zamalek, where Mido now plays. The students wanted a photograph taken with Mido and winger Mahmoud Abdelrazek, but they were not keen and a confrontation ensued. Cue jokes about Mido finally hitting the target."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
