The picture of Stephen Hawking, pages 10 and 11, G2, September 27, showed him coxing at Oxford (where he took his first degree) not at Cambridge. We misspelt archaeological in a headline and report, page 15, September 27: Getty museum knowingly bought archeological [sic] treasures stolen from Italy, investigation claims. Collins gives the version we used as the second spelling, but that is not Guardian style. It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
