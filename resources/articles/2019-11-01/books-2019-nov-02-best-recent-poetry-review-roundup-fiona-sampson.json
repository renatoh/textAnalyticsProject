While \u201cGlade\u201d opens \u201cthe long loan book of recurring dreams\u201d, picking a \u201cGentian Violet\u201d conjures up DH Lawrence when the roadside flower \u201ccultivates more dark to flare against\u201d. Elsewhere are raindrops, several appearances by the god Pan, a childhood playground, a series of British birds including the mistle thrush that gives the book its title and \u2013 changing the setting \u2013 a St Lucian hummingbird and \u201cThe Sloth\u201d. There\u2019s much to admire in this fluent writing, \u201cwhere buddleia / holds the signal at maroon for summer\u201d, and wine produces \u201ca blushing through the gut\u201d. But what unifies the book is a specific sensibility, the downbeat tone of the white western male babyboomer who\u2019s never had it so good and doesn\u2019t quite know what he is supposed to feel about this. Poetry can do things, this fastidious tone says, but not too many. We have outlived our own agency, \u201cThe working week gone west, cut loose / like a city from its port.\u201d The medieval Welsh Taliesin tradition includes prophecy, praise song, prayer, invective, flyting and riddle. Often highly political, it asserts community and religious identity. But it also has its feet in the mythological past, for while the real Taliesin lived in the sixth century, the poems collected in the 14th century Llyvyr Taliesin were written over the course of seven centuries. Suggestions of shamanism, and roles in both Arthurian myth and the Mabinogion legends, mean the idea of Taliesin has haunted modern poets, from David Jones to Gwyneth Lewis. Only a Welsh medievalist, though, would have had a chance to read the poems. Now Lewis has joined forces with Rowan Williams to produce a comprehensive set of translations, The Book of Taliesin: Poems of Warfare and Praise in an Enchanted Britain (Penguin, \u00a320). As befits such experienced poet-translators, the results are vivid and contemporary \u2013 as well as authoritative. The Book of Taliesin includes 60-odd pages of introduction, and even a guide to pronunciation. Compressed by highly wrought traditional forms, these voices from long ago address us today with urgency: \u201cif the world fell, / On to what would it drop?\u201d asks \u201cThe Small Song of the World\u201d. \u201cWith the sea on fire, / The world\u2019s dwellers will burn / Till all have perished. / The desert will burn [\u2026] The flood will overflow,\u201d says \u201cA Prophecy of Judgement Day\u201d, a lament that speaks for our own climate emergency. This is an evocative, provocative resource. The Taliesin poems come from a world with pre-modern ideas about personhood. But of course poetry since the Romantics has been fiercely interested in the self. The last half century, in particular has famously seen the rise of confessional poetry and, less famously, a revival of verse novels. All the same, a verse biography is something new. But Maitreyabandhu\u2019s After C\u00e9zanne (Bloodaxe, \u00a312) moves from the life to the work and back again to examine the post-impressionist painter\u2019s development. Packed with full-colour plates, with an introduction by art historian Christopher Lloyd, it also draws on the poet\u2019s own art school training. The writing is quiet, subtle, and makes the kind of surprising turns that are the mark of fine verse. This is no conventional, monolithic account turned into rhyme, but a sequence of lyric poems written in different voices to, about and \u201cas\u201d C\u00e9zanne. After C\u00e9zanne places their conversation in chronological order and interleaves the paintings. This allows us to hear \u2013 and see \u2013 the building reverberation of particular themes in the painter\u2019s life and work: like the apples that are the subject of so many of his still lives and that, we learn, he was given by his school friend \u00c9mile Zola. Colour combines with contemplation in C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work \u201cworshipping / pine shadows and grapes\u201d, and also in Maitreyabandhu\u2019s profound and beautiful homage to \u201csome other-seeing beyond / the binaries, a thirdness to the world.\u201d Colour combines with contemplation in Mimi Khalvati\u2019s Afterwardness (Carcanet, \u00a39.99), too. This sequence of 55 sonnets is autobiographical. Real-world colours surround the poems\u2019 narrator (\u201cIn Cardiology, the corridor / is a blue stream of lino\u201d), and \u201cOutpatients\u201d goes on, giving the unnoticed and the everyday significance, to see the waiting patients as fishermen, as Orpheus, as \u201cAli Kemal \u2013 that murdered politician / Who was Boris Johnson\u2019s great-grandfather.\u201d A poet of consummate artistry, Iranian-born Khalvati starts this portrait of her life of exile with her child self \u201cflying away from all you know\u201d. She ends it, after saying goodbye at the airport, with \u201cVapour Trails\u201d. The symmetry is elegant, and the collection is a sophisticated, original exploration of a self made in and by the new language, English, that the child on the plane learns: \u201ca via negativa / cruising at altitude on plumes of breath\u201d. \u2022 Fiona Sampson\u2019s Come Down (Corsair) will be published in February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
