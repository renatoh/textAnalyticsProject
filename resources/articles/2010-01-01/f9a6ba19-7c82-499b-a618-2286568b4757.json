Yang Ik-Joon's Breathless is a horribly nasty and violent drama from South Korea whose purpose is to show \u2013 probably entirely accurately \u2013 that the psychological origins of organised gang violence lie in family dysfunction. Only those who come from abusive families can be reliably and professionally violent. Yang Ik-Joon directs and stars as Song-hoon, the ugly and ferocious mob debt collector for whom violence is a way of effacing memories of how he failed to stand up to a violent father. He swears compulsively and has the classic gangster habit of perpetually slapping people around the head: a kind of abusive tic that he probably doesn't even recognise as particularly violent. His life changes when he meets a defiant high-school girl from the same abusive background as him: her brother yearns to join Song-hoon's mob. The pre-credit sequence, in which Song-hoon beats up a total stranger for beating up his girlfriend in the street, and then beats up the girlfriend, gives us the film in essence: it functions as a brutal short film in itself, after which the rest of the feature is a little superfluous. I wondered what the point was, after a while."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
