In the strange, chilling twilight, the dust surfed around, sometimes over, people, like a river of muck washing over pebbles of humanity. It blew over and ebbed away. No car's honk, no radio prattle, no supermarket muzak in this place: only the occasional donkey's bray, a dog's howl and the muffled sound of an ocean of people settling down for the night. Then, from somewhere on the far edge of this dismal refugee camp on a barren plain, came the haunting sound of a woman's voice. Womanhood in Afghanistan is so hidden away, so absent, that a female voice singing an Afghan lullaby was quietly shocking. It was coming from a deeper darkness. Silhouetted against the night sky was a pitifully ragged shelter, a blanket tacked over a wooden frame, open at one end to the scurrying dust. The glare of our kerosene lamp lit up a scene within as if from the Bible: a mother was rocking two wooden cots and singing her children to sleep. You would never see or hear this 'normally' but you can't banish women if they are forced to live in the open. She was a widow with five mouths to feed, her man killed by the Taliban. One of her children, a boy, had no toes. The Taliban had burnt down the house and he had been asleep inside a cot, her neighbours said. The woman did not speak for herself, only gathered her shawl around her face, and continued her lullaby. None of her children had shoes or cold weather clothes. I slept on the edge of the camp that night. It rained. With the rain came the promise of winter, and more deaths to come. Last winter, in this one camp, 12 miles south of the River Derya - known to the ancients as the Oxus - 40 children and 20 mothers with newborn babies died. Their graves are earth mounds, a few marked by flags, on the slopes of the dust-blown hill. The rain, and the snow to come, have a wider significance for the war against terror. Clouds make it harder for the American and British fighter jets to bomb and strafe in safety. They make it more difficult for helicopters to evacuate wounded Western ground troops to medical stations. The change in the weather means that the ground war involving large numbers of Western troops is unlikely to happen until the spring. And clouds make it easier for Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network to hide from the Canberra surveillance planes scouring Afghanistan with tri-optic cameras, which can read newspapers from eight miles up. The British photo-intelligence analysts can't see through clouds. In the morning the full awfulness of Sohai Bos refugee camp came home to me. This place is marked by absence. There is not a single tree, no shade, no green, no grass, no running water - a city of hopelessness plonked on moonrock. What water there is comes from a dirty irrigation canal, where donkeys drop their dung, and a dusty well. According to Merlin, a British medical charity, diseases in the region include anthrax, malaria, polio, cholera, typhus... you name it, Afghanistan has got it. The refugees here were forced out of their homes by the Taliban advance on Northern Alliance territory last September. Their men are fighting so that they can get their families back home before the winter. If they cannot, their children and child-bearing women will die. Bleakest of all, they have no international food aid. Nothing. None of the ugly yellow packs, marked 'US humanitarian food aid'. The packages have arrived in northern Afghanistan, but nowhere near Sohai Bos. Earlier in the week, on a mud road in a plain in the middle of nowhere, we came across three boys pulling honeycombed chunks of cardboard. Inside shabby coats they had hidden the goods, dropped from three miles up, containing plastic sachets of lentil stew, strawberry jam from California, peanut butter from Georgia and raisins packaged in Brooklyn, New York. Not a month ago I was sitting in a fire station in Brooklyn, where seven empty lockers marked the absence of seven firefighters, incinerated in the World Trade Centre. I found that discovery profoundly moving at the time, but that was before I had visited Sohai Bos. Britain's Aid Minister, Clare Short, has announced that the international community is shipping in 50,000 tonnes of food aid a month to Afghanistan. The use of the present tense is not entirely accurate. Ardag Meghdessian, director of the World Food Programme in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, which covers northern Afghanistan, said: 'We need to deliver 50,000 tonnes of food a month because six million Afghans will be at risk this winter. In some areas there is an 80 per cent dependency on food aid from the international community. Until the first strike by the Americans, we were hitting 500 tonnes a day. Now it is nothing like that.' What about the American food drops? 'If it's a C130' - a Hercules transport plane - 'that's 16 tonnes a planeload. If it's a Russian cargo plane, that's 40 tonnes.' So it is a bit of a PR exercise? 'Correct.' There is no question that the people of this camp are victims of the Taliban. They have lost their homes in reasonably well watered villages and now fight to survive on land which is all but desert. I spoke to one man who was locked inside a commercial container for four months by the Taliban, along with 20 others. Some of the others died in their own mess, he said. He survived because he was close to the small hole through which the prisoners were fed and watered. A second refugee said he had seen the Taliban lock people inside their homes and burn them alive. A third pointed to a horrific scar on his leg, where the Taliban had twisted a bayonet into his flesh, while his legs were bound. All refugees spin stories, to make some sense of the loss of their homes, and of their homeland. The stories of Taliban cruelty were so many that one felt there was a core of truth in them. One commander, carrying a walkie talkie, had just returned to the camp from the front line. He said he had heard Pashtu, Chechen and Arabic languages on the radio. The people speak of the Taliban with real fear in their voices. But the warlords of the Northern Alliance command are not angels. On the road to the camp, we passed through an abandoned village. The place was well watered, with an irrigation canal running through it, but no fields tended. 'Pashtuns lived here,' said our translator. Pashtuns are the main ethnic group in southern Afghanistan, and the Taliban recruit from them more than any other people. No one abandosn their village in this land without compelling reason. Inhumanity by the Tajiks and Uzbeks of the Northern Alliance seems the most likely reason for Pashtuns caught on the wrong, northern side of the Hindu Kush to flee, but the stones are silent. Nevertheless, people on the Northern Alliance side of the line do not seem to be universally terrified of their leaders. The people in Sohai Bos camp are genuinely afraid of the Taliban. Jeeps moving across the landscape raise plumes of dust, like the posse in John Ford's great western The Searchers. In this real-life Western, the good guys of the Northern Alliance aren't that good, but the bad guys are really bad. So the men from Sohai Bos are happy to go up to the front line. It is a strange, surreal war they seem to be fighting. The struggle to survive in the camp is far more epic, far more difficult, than life in the trenches. To get to them you walk through a graveyard, then up to a high bluff. High above the Oxus lies a zig-zag of trenches as sorry as anything in the First World War. The Northern Alliance trenches are stupidly shallow, and peopled by gentle smiling men who strut their stuff above the trenches then jump down into the dust, giggling, when the bad guys open up. A whizzbang came our way, but so long as you can hear the whizz you won't get the bang. At dusk, the Northern Alliance artillery display aggression, blowing up clouds of dust on the Taliban-held hillsides. The real war for survival is taking place elsewhere, in a refugee camp no one has heard of, where a mother has nothing to offer her children but the sweet emptiness of a lullaby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
