'I bet you're a relieved man,' said the Dagenham manager. 'Still in the Cup.' 'Not so much relieved,' replied Curbishley. 'It wouldn't have been the biggest disaster - but you can imagine the flak we would have got, being a Premier League club.' The Charlton manager wasn't being disrespectful. He just had his eye on the bread-and-butter stuff. He's got Derby County in the League on Tuesday, Spurs on Saturday - a warm-up for the fourth round - and then more of the same for a couple of months to come. Charlton's world would not have imploded if their Cup run had ended here; but a couple of losses in the Premiership and life really does get a bit grim. 'I don't even think about points any more,' said Curbishley. 'You've just got to keep getting results.' For Dagenham, however, the pain of defeat was deep. Their whole season was centred on this replay in front of a crowd packed into their ramshackle ground. Yet, despite a flurry of corners - 'I lost count how many they won,' said Curbishley - and several decent chances - they were denied a result by the brilliance of Dean Kiely in the Charlton goal and a hard-working, if messy defence. They should have won the first meeting, and everyone in the ground - including Curbishley - knew they should have won the replay. Shaun Newton's goal in the first minute of extra time, a straightforward strike from a cross by John Salako, came almost before the crowd had caught their breath after regulation time. It was maybe the only moment of the game when Dagenham took their eye off the ball. A quick reply by Tim Cole at the other end was disallowed, for a foul on Kiely - and that was about it. It wasn't mere romance and tradition that persuaded Dagenham to turn down the chance of bigger gate money at Upton Park; one look at their rolled porridge of a pitch told Charlton this was going to be trench warfare on Dagenham's terms. The Daggers made most of the early running and Junior McDougald was soon through the middle of a hesitant defence, denied only by Kiely's dive. Charlton's passing was astray and their nerves were apparent when a foul on McDougald just outside the box resulted in another free kick. Matthews' hot shot brought another fine save from Kiely, and the corners and the anxiety were piling up at the Charlton end. Mr Wiley was not roundly applauded for booking Jason Broom, but Charlton appreciated the scrap of encouragement. And blew it. Kevin Lisbie murdered one speculative attempt from range, then was denied twice by Tony Roberts. Dagenham had Charlton jittery from the first minute of the second half. Paul Terry sent a skidding 35-yard effort low and to Kiely's left, and the overworked keeper did well to hold on to it. McDougald tried a curling left-footer but Kiely was equal to the rare subtlety on an afternoon of unremitting toil in tough conditions. You sort of knew there would be extra time. And you sort of knew there would not be a fairytale at the end of it. There rarely is. 'You can lose and still be winners,' Hill said later, 'and that's what we've done.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
