The four-year-old, who beat Rakti in the Queen Anne Stakes during the Royal Ascot at York meeting in June, is unbeaten in his last three outings, with his latest win coming in the Group Three Prix Messidor at Maisons-Laffitte in July. Georges Rimaud, racing manager in France to owner the Aga Khan, confirmed the Andre Fabre-trained colt came out of that race unscathed and is expected to go well in the Group One contest on August 14. \"He has been ticking over nicely since winning the Prix Messidor and this [the Prix Jaques le Marois] was always the main objective,\" he said today. \"He's done absolutely nothing wrong and has as good a record as the others in the field. Valixir has won on a variety of surfaces so hopefully the conditions will not stand in our way.\" Standing in Valixir's way of victory in the one-mile event, however, is brilliant filly Divine Proportions. The Pascal Bary-trained three-year-old secured a fifth Group One success when winning the Prix d'Astarte at Deauville on Sunday. Godolphin's Dubawi, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas and finished third in the Vodafone Derby, is also set to test Valixir. \"It should be a very, very interesting race,\" Rimaud added. \"I watched Divine Proportions on Sunday and she won terribly impressively. Dubawi is also a nice horse who we expect to go well over a mile again. \"Although you cannot be confident because anything can happen between now and the race, we are hopeful. It should be one of the races of the season.\" Divine Proportions is 4-6 favourite with Coral, with Valixir 7-2 and Dubawi 4-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
