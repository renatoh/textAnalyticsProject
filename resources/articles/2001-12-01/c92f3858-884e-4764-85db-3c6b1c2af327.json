Right now, two French resorts already in the premier league (La Plagne and Les Arcs) are spending a fortune building a cable car link so that each can pretend to have more piste kilometres. Soon, it seems, the eastern half of the Austrian Tirol will be welded into a single lift network. No harm in that, but, over the years, I've veered towards a different view: that quality matters more than quantity. I'm less concerned about how many slightly different moguls I encounter in an alpine week and more interested in the subtle satisfactions that the mountains can offer - spectacular views, charming villages, traditional winter diversions and welcoming, civilised restaurants both on and off the mountain. Happily, there are places where all these pleasures can be found. Of the half dozen favourite resorts I've picked out, all but Courmayeur offer enough terrain to rival that of many purpose-built ski stations. But they are all much more attractive places for those of us who ski without blinkers. Chamonix, France Not every aspect of Chamonix fits the picture-postcard prescription but, as an antidote to the soullessness of the usual French resort, it is unbeatable. Its cobbled traffic-free central streets are lined by old chalets housing cafes and shops. High season is summer, when mountaineers and tourists are drawn to Mont Blanc and to the spectacular cable-car rides to Le Brevent and the Aiguille du Midi - start of the famously long and spectacular Vallee Blanche run. There is skating, curling, ice hockey and excellent facilities for indoor sports. If you can afford it, stay at the Jeu de Paume, a chic chalet-hotel on the road to Argenti\u00e8re. Simply Ski (0208 541 2209) is offering a week's stay at the Chalet Mont Blanc from \u00a3459 in January. Flights from Gatwick to Lyon, transfers and seven nights' half-board accommodation are included. Other operators featuring the resort include Inghams, Club Med and Neilson. Courmayeur, Italy It is no coincidence that my one Italian choice also lies at the foot of Mont Blanc: mountaineering was what drove the early tourist development in Courmayeur. For skiing, Courmayeur is far from ideal, with no runs to the village from its limited local slopes on the far side of the valley. So why go? The inconvenience of the cable-car ride is minor, and far outweighed by the pleasures of long lunches in the countless rustic mountain restaurants such as Maison Vieille, and close-up views of glacial Mont Blanc. The narrow, car-free central streets are lined with stone-built houses offering serious shopping for the fur-wrapped Torinese, who arrive on Friday afternoon in time for a short passaggiatta before retiring to the Caffe della Posta or the Cadran Solaire for a restorative whisky. Crystal Holidays (0870 848 7000) has a week's stay at the Hotel Del Viale from \u00a3409 in January, including return flights from Gatwick to Turin, transfers and half-board accommodation. Other operators include Mark Warner, Esprit Ski and Airtours. Lech, Austria Austria's stock-in-trade is its scores of cute farming villages. What sets Lech apart? Exceptional snow; a privileged setting, surrounded by peaks at the head of a remote valley, with a river burbling beside the main street; and classy, comfortable hotels that are the pivot of the resort's apr\u00e8s-ski scene. Start in the champagne bar of Oberlech's Hotel Montana, descend by toboggan to the Hotel Krone's ice bar beside the river, progress to the Hotel Tannbergerhof's tea-time disco, and so on. Inghams (0208 780 4433) is offering a week's stay at the four-star Romantiq Hotel Krone from \u00a3884, including half-board accommodation, flights to Innsbruck and transfers. Other operators include Ski Total, Crystal Holidays and Flexiski. Meg\u00e8ve, France Meg\u00e8ve has its roots in a medieval village, but was developed for skiing to create a rival to St Moritz. Happily, the French produced a more charming version of swank than the Swiss. Meg\u00e8ve has an open-air ice rink, cobbled streets and a fine church at its heart. The best hotels, such as the Chalet du Mont d'Arbois, are the essence of rustic chic, and this is a great resort for indulgent lunches on the mountain. Many of the 30 restaurants have table service and the terraces have fine views. Thomson Ski (0870 606 1470) is offering a week's stay at the three-star Hotel Au Coeur de Meg\u00e8ve from \u00a3505, including flights from Gatwick to Geneva, transfers and half-board accommodation. Other operators include First Choice, Erna Low and Made to Measure Holidays. Wengen, Switzerland Wengen was an isolated hamlet when the British discovered it. The little village is irresistibly cute, and the scenery is spectacular - the Hotel Jungfrau and the Belvedere get the best views. Thanks to Grindelwald over the hill, there's lots of skiing on hand. Swiss Travel Service (0870 727 5911) has a week's stay at the Wengener Hof from \u00a3660 per person, including flights from Heathrow to Zurich or Geneva, half-board accommodation, rail transfers and Fly Luggage facilities. Other operators include Kuoni Switzerland, Bladon Lines and Crystal Holidays. Zermatt, Switzerland I wrestled with the choice between Zermatt and its near-neighbour Saas-Fee. Both are high, remote, car-free villages, with narrow chalet-lined streets shared by pedestrians and electric milk-floats posing as taxis. But in the end Zermatt always has its ace: the fabulous Matterhorn, dominating the views from the slopes and from the terraces of some mountain restaurants. These are simply the world's best. Among the cream are Chez Vrony at Findeln (with that view) and Zum See (without). A word of warning: this is one of the few major resorts that is totally unsuitable for beginners. Ski Scott Dunn (0208 682 5050) is offering a one-week stay at the three-bedroom chalet Bolero A for \u00a31,025 per person from 23 December. Flights from Gatwick, transfers and half-board accommodation are included. Other operators include Powder Byrne, Lotus Supertravel and Inghams. \u00b7 Chris Gill is editor of Where to Ski and Snowbard 2002: The Reuters Guide (published by Norton Wood, \u00a315.99)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
