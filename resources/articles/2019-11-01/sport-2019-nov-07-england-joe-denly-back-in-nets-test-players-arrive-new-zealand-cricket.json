Bairstow, playing in the Twenty20 series, was dropped from the Test team after the summer\u2019s drawn Ashes series. Ed Smith, the national selector, told Bairstow to \u201creset\u201d and target a return as a specialist batsman, rather than his previous role as wicketkeeper. Denly has returned to training after suffering strained ankle ligaments at the start of the tour \u2013 the right\u2013hander did some light jogging and batted in the nets \u2013 but England have decided it is best to take the cautious route. Joe Root\u2019s Test squad play a two-day practice match against a New Zealand XI in Whangarei from Tuesday. That is followed by a three-day first-class match against New Zealand A beginning on Friday. The latter is Denly\u2019s target at this stage. It therefore hands Bairstow a chance to push his claims for the two-match Test series against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui starting on 21 November, even if England are saying at this stage the 30-year-old is only providing cover for Denly. England\u2019s red-ball players have arrived to begin preparations for the series \u2013 one that sits outside the World Test Championship points system \u2013 and will be joined by Darren Gough, the former quick who will spend the next two weeks as a consultant to the seamers. With Paul Collingwood about to sign a full-time contract as an assistant coach, it leaves the fast-bowling role as the one remaining vacancy in Chris Silverwood\u2019s backroom staff. Shane Bond, currently with the New Zealand camp for a short spell, performed this role for England during the first two Tests of the 2017-18 Ashes and built a strong rapport with Joe Root. Bond did not rule himself out but also summed up England\u2019s difficulty in finding a suitable candidate: the 44-year-old\u2019s freelance T20 work at Mumbai Indians and Sydney Thunder \u2013 and an upcoming assistant position with Southern Brave in The Hundred \u2013 is potentially more lucrative and less time-consuming than international cricket. Bond said: \u201cThe biggest challenge of the international game is the grind of a coach. Look at England in particular: 300 days a year on the road, it\u2019s challenging on family life. Whether it\u2019s coaches or players, good management of people is paramount.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
