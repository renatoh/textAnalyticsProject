Dingoes are not just some sort of gone-to-seed dog or disreputable wolf, the scholars discovered, but constitute a special branch of the dog family all of their own. And, since the dingo originally came from Asia, between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, it can be regarded as an early migrant that helped create the vibrant multicultural democracy that is Australia today. Many Australians worry about the future of dingoes, but it is fair to say that they have not historically had a good reputation, being compared unfavourably by white settlers with their biddable European dogs. The use of \"dingo\" as a term of abuse should surely now stop. Australians should ask themselves whether they can do without one pejorative word ending in O. Isn't \"drongo\" enough?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
