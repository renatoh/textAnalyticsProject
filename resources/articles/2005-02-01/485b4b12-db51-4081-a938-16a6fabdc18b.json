The loss compared to a profit of \u00a36m for 2003. Europe's largest defence firm, BAE also owns 20% of Airbus, the world's leading manufacturer of civilian aircraft. BAE said the charges were incurred in relation to the avionics and defence communications business acquired in 1999 as part of the BAE's merger with Marconi Electronic Systems, and its deal earlier this year with Italy's Finmeccanica SpA to create Eurosystems, a defence electronic group. Other charges occurred as a result of acquiring the Integrated Defence Solutions business in North America and from BAE's naval ships business. The company has made a profit once in the past five years. However, the company reported a strong rise in operating cash inflow to \u00a32bn from \u00a3836m, with a year-end net cash position of \u00a35m compared to a \u00a3870m debt a year earlier. It raised its proposed dividend to 9.5p a share from 9.2p in 2003. Sales increased to \u00a313.4bn from \u00a312.5bn. BAE has been expanding in the US to capitalise on heavy Pentagon spending and to make up for declining profit margins from its largest contract, the Al Yamamah defence programme in Saudi Arabia. In 2002, BAE reported its biggest loss in 10 years after taking a \u00a3750m charge to cover cost overruns on its Astute submarine and Nimrod plane orders, a source of considerable acrimony with the Ministry of Defence. In November, BAE said it was one of the subjects of a UK fraud enquiry into suspected false accounting related to Saudi arms sales. The company denied wrongdoing. Negative publicity surrounding the investigation probe may affect BAE's chances of securing future orders from the Saudis, according to analysts. Airbus contributed \u00a3176m to BAE's underlying earnings versus \u00a3204m a year earlier. \"Airbus continues to build upon the strong performance of 2003 despite a number of challenges in the current commercial aircraft market and against a backdrop of rising fuel prices and adverse US dollar exchange rates,\" Mike Turner, BAE's chief executive, said in a statement. Mr Turner said he could not see a better use for its funds when asked about media reports suggesting BAE might sell its Airbus stake. BAE shares were up 1.3% to 253.25p in afternoon trading on the London stock exchange."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
