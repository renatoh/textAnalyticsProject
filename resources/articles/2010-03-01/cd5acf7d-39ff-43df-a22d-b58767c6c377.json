How the winning margin remained a single goal owed nothing to resolute Hibernian defending \u2013 the odd save by Graham Stack excepted \u2013 and everything to potentially harmful profligacy by the home players. The goals from Andrew Driver and Gary Glen should have been complemented by at least another four, while Derek Riordan's late counter marked Hibs' only shot on target. It was, once again, the kind of row between the neighbours that keeps life interesting. The frequently bizarre nature of derby matches tends to render the unexpected almost routine, but nothing could have prepared anyone at Tynecastle for the first-half burst of vandalism from Hearts that inflicted serious damage on Hibs and left the home side with a pronounced advantage. Not only had the visitors moved the ball around more sweetly \u2013 without actually threatening the home goal \u2013 but Hearts had injury problems that would force them to use two of their substitutes within the opening half-hour and necessitate a series of positional switches. Defender Dawid Kucharski was first to go \u2013 Suso Santana came on to play wide, Lee Wallace moved from left-back to central defence and Eggert Jonsson went from defence to midfield \u2013 followed later by head-injury victim Ian Black, who was already struggling when Hearts scored the first of their goals. It was a miscalculation from Stack \u2013 not the first time a Hibs goalkeeper has contributed to bad times in this fixture \u2013 but the initial good work was done by Suso. The Spaniard skipped away from Lewis Stevenson on the right and delivered a powerful cross. Stack clearly thought the ball would pass the outside of his left post, but it rebounded from the upright straight to Driver, whose first-time volley with his left foot from 12 yards was brilliant, sending the ball high to the left of the goalkeeper. The Hibs defenders had clearly not recovered from the blow when they were sent to the canvas once again. This time, it was Driver's corner kick from the right that was met by Jonsson, and his header forward was deflected past Stack by Glen, the striker positioned with his back to goal three yards from the line. Those goals triggered a panic in the visitors that lasted until the interval and held the promise of the loss of further goals every time the ball was crossed into their penalty area. But, in their push to recover ground after the break, Hibs showed themselves to be even more vulnerable to the quick counter-thrust than they had to crosses. Nobody in the ground could fathom how they contrived not to double their lead in the opening 10 minutes of the second half. Suso was first to squander the seemingly unmissable opportunity when he came in from the right to meet a low centre from David Obua, who had burst clear into the left side of the area. The pass was true, but the Spaniard, harassed by Lewis Stevenson, somehow managed to knock the ball over the bar. If anything, Glen was even more culpable a few minutes later. Another deft lay-off from Obua sent the striker clear of every outfield player. He even managed to take the ball past Stack, but over-ran it across the deadball line. Within two minutes of that incident, Glen would force an exceptional save from Stack with a glanced header from Laryea Kingston's free kick. When David Wotherspoon's cross from the right fell to Riordan, he side-footed the ball high past Janos Balogh to produce a scoreline that was a distorted reflection of the general play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
