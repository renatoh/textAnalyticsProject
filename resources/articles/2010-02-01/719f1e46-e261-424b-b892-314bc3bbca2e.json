They made desperately hard work of putting away a Salford team who remain pointless at the bottom of the table \u2013 although on the evidence of this gutsy effort, they will not do for long \u2013 and also lost the Australian wing Scott Donald with a shoulder injury that seems certain to rule him out of the Melbourne game. That could leave the Rhinos worryingly short of three-quarters, although at least they can rely on Keith Senior, the veteran centre whose two tries were crucial as they bounced back from consecutive defeats by Castleford and Wakefield. \"We'd like to have had a lot more cohesion,\" said the Leeds coach, Brian McClennan, who refused to speculate on Donald's chances. \"Our timing is off but the beauty here is we've got experience in big games, so it doesn't take much to turn it around.\" Leeds offered an early hint of a return to form with a slick seventh-minute try, Senior collecting Jamie Jones-Buchanan's pass to maintain his record of scoring in each of the Super League's 15 seasons. But for the remainder of the first half they were held scoreless by a tenacious Salford side who made light of the absence of Ray Cashmere and Daniel Holdsworth to play some excellent rugby of their own, who were good value for the try from Ashley Gibson, a former Leeds three-quarter who shrugged off Brent Webb's weak attempted tackle to cut the half-time deficit to 6-4. Salford undermined much of that good work by making a series of handling errors at the start of the second half, putting themselves under pressure from which Webb made amends by touching down Rob Burrow's accurate chip. But Leeds showed no signs of finishing them off and instead their own indiscipline handed Salford the position to reduce the arrears to 12-10 when Willie Talau punished Danny McGuire's failure to deal with a high kick. It took another kick, this time from Kevin Sinfield, to set up the second try for Senior which established much needed breathing space for the Rhinos in the 66th minute. They grabbed a flattering fourth deep into stoppage time when Ian Kirke backed up a rampaging burst by the New Zealand international Greg Eastwood. But there was certainly nothing here to worry Billy Slater, Greg Inglis and the rest of the Storm superstars who Leeds must stop next weekend.
