Draft legislation contains insufficient verification checks to deter criminals from submitting false information and could allow those exploiting trusts to circumvent controls, MPs and peers have said. More than \u00a390bn is estimated to be laundered illegally through the UK each year, according to the all-party parliamentary committee scrutinising the registration of overseas entities bill. Illicit funds help sustain Britain\u2019s inflated property market through the purchase of homes that are frequently left unoccupied, emptying the wealthier parts of London of residents. The issue was highlighted last year in the BBC drama McMafia, based on the book by Misha Glenny, which examined the penetration of western economies by organised Russian criminal gangs. The proposed register could have a radical impact on house sales in the capital as well as other parts of the country, but its supporters fear it may be delayed by the political paralysis induced by the Brexit crisis. Lord Faulks QC, the Conservative chair of the draft bill committee and a former justice minister, welcomed the \u201cmuch-needed legislation\u201d. He said it was \u201cwell drafted, but there are still some loopholes in the draft bill which, if unaddressed, could jeopardise the effectiveness of this important piece of legislation. \u201cIn the current political climate, anti-money-laundering may not seem an immediate priority. But the evidence we took shows there is a huge problem, and it\u2019s not going away. Time is of the essence: the government must get on with improving this bill and making it law.\u201d His committee\u2019s report says that in 2017, 160 properties worth over \u00a34bn were purchased by \u201chigh-corruption-risk\u201d individuals. As many as 86,000 properties in England and Wales have been identified as owned by companies incorporated in \u201csecrecy jurisdictions\u201d \u2013 commonly known as tax havens. Between 2004 and 2015, \u00a3180m of UK property was subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption; many suspect that is the tip of the iceberg. It is the security of UK\u2019s stable, law-abiding environment, paradoxically, that attracts dirty money. Prof Jonathan Fisher QC, a barrister at Bright Line Law, told the committee: \u201cIf you asked the fraudsters \u2026 they would tell you \u2026 they are very comfortable with the political environment. London property has always been a good bet. We see evidence of organised criminals buying property outside London as well. It is broadly the stability element that attracts them.\u201d A few countries \u2013 New Zealand, Thailand, India and Switzerland \u2013 have restrictions on ownership of land by non-nationals. The UK is pioneering the development of a publicly accessible register of overseas commercial \u201centities\u201d that will expose whoever is the beneficial owner behind a foreign company. The committee is concerned, however, that the bill establishing the register does not cover trusts since they may not technically be \u201centities\u201d. It is therefore calling on the government to ensure trusts are rendered transparent, through the Fifth EU Anti-Money-Laundering Directive, which needs to be introduced at the same time as the legislation. The report also warns that plans for exemptions to the register \u2013 probably for foreign governments \u2013 need to be strictly limited and parliament informed when such exemptions are used. Information on the register should be updated every year and before property transactions take place. The MPs and peers say tougher verification checks are required to ensure fraudsters do not submit false entries and suggest that experts from Companies House or regulated professionals could be made responsible for the accuracy of information. Enforcement should be through civil penalties backed up by criminal sanctions for non-payment of fines, the report proposes. By preventing the completion of sales, the register in effect would have the power to freeze assets. Working in conjunction with the Serious Fraud Office, National Crime Agency and law enforcement agencies using unexplained wealth orders, the register is intended to improve coordination in the fight against fraud and money laundering. All foreign-registered entities, including those in Ireland, will be affected. There has been concern over the definition of beneficial ownership for registration affecting only those who own 25% or more of a foreign company. The report suggested lowering that threshold. Faulks said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty outrageous that great chunks of our country are owned by people whose identity we are uncertain of and that the source of their funds remains a mystery. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much disagreement between the parties. I don\u2019t think there is any reason to delay this. There will no doubt be someone saying that this will deter foreign investment but I would reply that this is just the form of investment we want to deter if it\u2019s [distorting] the property market.\u201d Ava Lee, a senior anti-corruption campaigner at Global Witness, said: \u201cThis bill has the potential to be groundbreaking. For the first time we could find out who really owns this country.\u201d Duncan Hames, the director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: \u201cEvery day that passes, criminals and the corrupt are able to hide behind the cloak of anonymity to launder their stolen wealth into our property market \u2026 if we are to stop the UK being a safe haven for dirty money, now is the time for action.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
