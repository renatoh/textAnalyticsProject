In his first international tournament as a player, the 1966 World Cup in England, he went out with two team-mates, missed the team's curfew and was suspended for the first game against Germany. Switzerland lost the game 5-0 and the proud Kuhn was devastated. He has never forgiven himself for the misdemeanour and, as the current Switzerland coach, he does certainly not tolerate any of his players to step over the line in a similar manner. He still does not want to talk about the incident (\"I have spent all this time trying to forget about it. Why should I want to talk about it?\") and now demands \"complete trust\" from his players. Kuhn is the first Swiss to lead the national team since 1989 and has been a breath of fresh air. He took Switzerland to their first tournament finals since 1996 by qualifying for Portugal, but needs a good result against England in Coimbra tomorrow after the tepid draw against Croatia. He has been vilified in the Swiss press for being too kind and too shy and there were grumblings about his lack of experience when he was promoted from the under-21 team in 2001. Yet he refuses to give up on his style of leadership. \"I noticed when I took over the squad in 2001 that the players weren't enjoying themselves. We have created a good team spirit,\" Kuhn said. \"We are a small football nation and only have a chance to beat the bigger countries when we show solidarity and fight for each other. \"I wouldn't be able to write a cook book with recipes for success but I do know that I need to have a good relationship with my players. I don't expect something new and modern, only old-fashioned decency, trust, honesty and respect. With that you can get far.\" Kuhn knows that now, 38 years after his nightmare experience in England. \u00b7 Fabio Celestini is likely to replace the suspended Johann Vogel as the holding midfielder for Switzerland against England tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
