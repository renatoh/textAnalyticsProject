Root was offered the job by Andrew Strauss, the director of England cricket, on Sunday following Cook\u2019s resignation at the start of last week and, with Ben Stokes named as vice-captain, the 26-year-old will lead the team into the summer series against South Africa and West Indies before defending the Ashes in Australia next winter. \u201cIt is a huge honour to be given the England Test captaincy,\u201d said Root, who is the 80th man to hold the position and the 10th Yorkshire player to do so. \u201cI feel privileged, humbled and very excited. \u201cWe have a very good group of players and I\u2019m looking forward to leading them out in the summer, building on Alastair\u2019s achievements and making the most of our talents in the years ahead. The senior guys play a very influential role and, while there\u2019s a natural progression for me, it\u2019s a huge support to know that they are there to help and advise.\u201d Root, as the vice-captain for the past 18 months, had been expected to make the step up once Cook called time on his record 59 Tests in charge and in a break from tradition will be unveiled at his home ground of Headingley \u2013 not Lord\u2019s - on Wednesday afternoon. His captaincy experience to date has been limited to a handful of domestic matches and at age-group level, an unavoidable consequence of being a mainstay in the Test side since his debut in 2012. Strauss, who gave him the No2 role on assuming control of the senior men\u2019s side two years ago, is confident of the appointment regardless. \u201cJoe has shown a number of admirable qualities in his Test career so far,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cHe is universally respected by his team-mates, passionate about driving the Test team forward and extremely excited about prospect of leading his country. Making his debut in 2012 at the age of 21 and going on to establish himself as one of the premier batsmen in all forms of the game demonstrates his drive, determination, cricketing intelligence and an ability to learn that will serve him well in his new role.\u201d Root was interviewed by Strauss and James Whitaker, the national selector, on Thursday, with the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, joining in via Skype from his home in Australia. Root convinced the trio of his ability to bring the \u201cfresh voice\u201d that Cook had said was needed to reinvigorate a stagnating side that lost eight of its 17 Tests last year, including the brutal 4-0 humbling in India before Christmas. On the promotion of Stokes, 25, who along with Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler was also interviewed, Strauss said: \u201cBen has real presence and influence within the team environment that serve as a great source of support for Joe. I have no doubts that the responsibility will also help him to continue his rapid rise as a world class all-rounder.\u201d With the focus now on one-day cricket in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy in June, and Eoin Morgan remaining in charge of the limited-overs teams with Buttler as his vice-captain, Root\u2019s reign will begin at Lord\u2019s on July with the first of four Tests against South Africa. A three\u2011match series at home against West Indies follows, meaning Root, Bayliss and Stokes will have seven Tests to shape their side before the Ashes gets under way at the Gabba in Brisbane on 23 November. With Root the standout batsman in the side \u2013 no player in world cricket has scored more than his 4,594 runs from 53 Tests since his debut just over four years ago \u2013 there will be concerns as to how the captaincy will affect his returns, not least since he remains a key player for England in all three formats and became a father for the first time in January. \u201cKnowing Joe it will probably enhance his batting rather than affect it,\u201d said Yorkshire\u2019s director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, while the former England captain Nasser Hussain told Sky Sports: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the boyish smile. He likes to joke around but there\u2019s a very serious side to Joe Root \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen in his cricket. He\u2019s a steely character.\u201d The right-hander\u2019s promotion means the top four batsmen in the world now lead their countries in Test cricket and Steve Smith of Australia, India\u2019s Virat Kohli and the New Zealander Kane Williamson have all seen their averages increase since their respective appointments. England will hope that, as with those three, the additional responsibility brings a greater ruthlessness to Root\u2019s game \u2013 only three of his last 17 scores in excess of 50 having been converted into hundreds \u2013 and that his time back in the ranks of the one-day and Twenty20 sides will prevent the role from being all-consuming. In Cook, he will have valuable resource also, with the 32-year-old opener now switching to a new role as a senior player and looking to continue his record-breaking career for another four to five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
