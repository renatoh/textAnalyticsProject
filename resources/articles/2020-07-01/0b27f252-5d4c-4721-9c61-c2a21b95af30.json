US district judge Steve Jones ruled against the state in a lawsuit filed by abortion providers and an advocacy group. Jones had temporarily blocked the law in October, and it never went into effect. The new ruling permanently enjoins the state from ever enforcing House Bill 481. Republican governor Brian Kemp, who has supported the restriction, immediately vowed an appeal. \u201cWe will appeal the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Kemp said in a statement. \u201cGeorgia values life and we will keep fighting for the rights of the unborn.\u201d The prospects of an appeal are uncertain, though, considering the US supreme court last month struck down other abortion restrictions from Louisiana. Georgia\u2019s measure sought to ban abortions once any cardiac activity can be detected \u2013 which can be as early as six weeks, before many women even realize they are pregnant. Such legislation is often called a heartbeat bill, although it is medically a misnomer as the law kicks in earlier than a full beating heart has formed in a human fetus. The bill narrowly passed the Georgia general assembly in spring 2019 amid intense lobbying for and against, with some saying film production companies could boycott the state as an economic sanction for the ultra-conservative move. Women in Georgia can currently seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. Both the state and those challenging the law asked Jones to rule without a trial, saying there were no disputed facts. Jones granted the challengers\u2019 motions for summary judgment and denied the state\u2019s motions, finding the law violated the 14th amendment. \u201cThe court rejects the state defendants\u2019 argument that the statutory purpose solely concerns \u2018promoting fetal wellbeing\u2019,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cInstead, HB 481\u2019s specific references to Roe v Wade and \u2018established abortion-related precedents\u2019 \u2026 lends support to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the purpose of HB 481 was to ban or de facto ban abortion.\u201d Jones refused to leave any parts of the law in effect, which would have also granted personhood to a fetus, giving it the same legal rights as people have after they\u2019re born. For example, a mother could have claimed a fetus as a dependent in order to reduce taxes. Supreme court precedent has for nearly five decades held that states cannot ban abortion prior to the viability of a fetus, and since Georgia\u2019s law does just that it is unconstitutional, the law\u2019s opponents argued. The state argued that the law promoted fetal well-being. It was widely considered as one of a number of attempts to create fresh legal challenges to abortion after two new conservative justices were confirmed to the supreme court. The legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, one of the groups that brought the lawsuit, said any appeal would be fruitless. \u201cThe district court blocked Georgia\u2019s abortion ban, because it violates over 50 years of supreme court precedent and fails to trust women to make their own personal decisions,\u201d said Sean Young in a statement. \u201cThis case has always been about one thing: letting her decide. It is now up to the state to decide whether to appeal this decision and prolong this lawsuit.\u201d Georgia\u2019s attorney general, Chris Carr, declined immediate comment, with spokesperson Katie Byrd saying the Republican\u2019s office was still reviewing the ruling. At least eight states passed so-called heartbeat bills in 2019, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee. South Carolina is still considering one. All of the legislation joined the fate of earlier such abortion bans from Arkansas, North Dakota and Iowa in being at least temporarily blocked by judges. Louisiana\u2019s ban wouldn\u2019t take effect unless a court upholds Mississippi\u2019s law. In a separate ruling Monday, a federal judge in Tennessee blocked a Tennessee law that Republican governor Bill Lee had signed hours earlier banning an abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy and prohibiting abortions based on race, sex or diagnosis of Down syndrome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
