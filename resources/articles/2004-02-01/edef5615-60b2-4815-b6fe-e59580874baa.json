They hope that video footage of two greyhounds pulling at a still alive and twitching hare while a crowd roars and whistles will persuade the public to back their campaign to get the sport stopped. As many as 10,000 fans are expected to attend the 157th Waterloo cup, a three-day event involving greyhounds chasing hares in an enclosed field in Great Altcar, Lancashire. Campaigners hope the event will be ended if the hunting bill is presented to the Commons this parliamentary session. The RSPCA estimates that one in five of the hares used has been killed since 1998 - 76 out of 373 hares. The Countryside Alliance says the figure is more likely to be one in eight. At a press conference yesterday Mike Hobday of the League Against Cruel Sports condemned the race as \"by far the most horrible\" of all blood sports taking place in Britain. The RSPCA's chief inspector for Merseyside, Martin Marsh, who was asked whether a ban would put an end to the activity, said: \"It might go underground. If it does, we would pursue offenders vigorously.\" The television vet Emma Milne said: \"My reaction when I first heard about the Waterloo Cup was one of total shock. I couldn't believe that it was still legal. \"Hare coursing is on a par with dog fighting, cock fighting and badger baiting, all of which are outlawed. Postmortems on coursed hares have shown that they can die a gruesome death as the dogs savage them.\" Interest in the event has been provoked by the news that the actor Vinnie Jones and the television cook Clarissa Dickson-Wright are supporting it. The former Spice Girl Mel C is supporting the opposition. Hunting supporters deny that the event is cruel. Liz Mort, the Countryside Alliance's East Anglia regional director, said: \"Properly regulated coursing is the ultimate test of a greyhound. It is entirely natural for both animals.\" The hare had the advantage of a head start and being on its own territory.It was also beneficial for conservation, she added. \"It encourages farmers and landowners to keep hares, instead of killing them as pests.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
