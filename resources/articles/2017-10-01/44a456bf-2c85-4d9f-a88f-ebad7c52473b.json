All bills are included and I was wondering if this is legal. I consequently have no proof I\u2019m living here. I\u2019ve never met the landlord \u2013 we leave the cash in our bedrooms and he goes in and collects it. CW, London Cash payments are certainly not ideal as the landlord is likely to be using them to dodge tax and because you have no proof of payment or, indeed, what you are paying for, unless he is issuing invoices for the services included and signed receipts. Certainly the landlord should not be entering bedrooms to collect the rent and you need to request that payments are made outside the property, according to Ralph Bullivant, partner in the property litigation team at Hill Dickinson LLP. As for the proof of residency, he says, you should have been given a tenancy agreement (normally an assured shorthold tenancy agreement). If it was not provided, the landlord can be obliged to provide a statement of terms of your tenancy, including his name and address, and it must be provided within 28 days. Even if the property is managed by a letting agent you are entitled to know the contact details of your landlord. If these have not been provided, the landlord may have difficulties recovering rent arrears from you. If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Include an address and phone number."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
