After a period in which he has helped transform England's standing in the world, Woodward yesterday signed a new contract with the Rugby Football Union, extending his tenure as the England coach for another four years. The appointment follows a season of unprecedented triumph of 10 successive victories, including Woodward's first grand slam. The 47-year-old has now helped England to the top of the world rankings since taking over from Jack Rowell six years ago. Woodward, who last night paid tribute to the players who have recently returned from the southern hemisphere after back-to-back wins over New Zealand and Australia, was due to see his current contract expire at the end of this autumn's World Cup in Australia. The success over the All Blacks in Wellington last month was only England's second Test win in New Zealand while their win in Melbourne the following week was their first over the Wallabies on Australian soil. The decision to offer Woodward a new contract was unanimously agreed by the RFU management board. The board chairman Graeme Cattermole said: \"We're delighted to appoint Clive through to the end of the World Cup in 2007. He has done an outstanding job for England and taken the side to new heights, on and off the field. Clive's track record over the last four years is superb with 33 wins out of the last 37, 10 consecutive wins against southern hemisphere opposition and England unbeaten at Twickenham since 1999. \"Along with all England supporters, the management board has enjoyed seeing the progress Clive has made with the team, culminating in the grand slam and the unbeaten summer tour. It would have been inevitable that speculation would have grown about Clive's future before and during the World Cup in October and November. We wanted to end that quickly and acknowledge all the positive work he has done by extending his appointment for a further four years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
