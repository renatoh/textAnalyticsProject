Two minutes before the curfew began at last the crowd dispersed, leaving Carlos Soler alone in the silence. All that and it came down to this. For 99 minutes Valencia and Getafe had done battle, another chapter in a modern rivalry, producing two red cards, 13 yellows, 43 fouls, three goals and then this: a penalty to finish. Having been 1-0 up, Valencia were 2-1 down, conceding in the 87th and 94th minutes, the void opening beneath them. But suddenly here in the 100th minute was a way out, for now at least. The closing minutes had been wild but at last there was quiet, everyone waiting for the final twist, a single kick. \u201cI was calm in the sense there\u2019s nothing else you can do and there\u2019s no time for anything else to happen: it\u2019s over,\u201d Gracia said. \u201cYou trust in your player.\u201d Soler had stood with the ball under his arm for three minutes, trying to escape the arguments, the pressure and the attempts to put him off, given time to think: about the responsibility and the crisis engulfing Valencia, facing a fourth consecutive defeat and two points off relegation, another man abandoning ship that very morning; about everything that had happened. Enough had happened on Sunday night let alone all the previous ones. \u201cValencia awaited The Bordal\u00e1s Boys like the Poles awaited the Panzer Division: with fear painted across their faces,\u201d claimed local paper Super Deporte, with characteristic constraint, but they had matched Getafe. A little before half-time, Yunus Musah, an England youth international born in New York, raised in Italy and with Ghanaian parents, had given Valencia the lead. Racing from inside his own half, reaching almost 34km/h, and slotting the ball tidily beyond David Soria, he became the youngest overseas player to score for Valencia, the youngest player of any nationality in 79 years and the second youngest in their history, aged 17 years, 338 days. A red card for Thierry Correia left Valencia with 10 men for over half an hour but they had resisted. And while Getafe pressed and someone shot from the bench to have an angry word with a ballboy considerably older than their goalscorer, telling him to slow the hell down and asking \u201cwhat are you, a Getafe fan?\u201d, mostly they did so quite convincingly. There had even been chances to end it, for Toni Lato and Maxi G\u00f3mez. But then, with victory within their grasp, the ball slipped from Jaume Dom\u00e9nech\u2019s grasp. The keeper made a mess of Mauro Arambarri\u2019s long shot \u2013 \u201cabsolutely horrific,\u201d in the words of former Valencia goalkeeper Santi Ca\u00f1izares \u2013 pushing it into the path of Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez to equalise. For Valencia it was hard enough to take, but it was about to get worse. In the 93rd-minute Cucho had a great chance to make it 2-1, sending the ball sailing into the empty second tier. And then, suddenly, substitute Abdoulay Diaby was in. His shot hit the post but \u00c1ngel reacted quickest to put away the rebound. The clock in the stadium scoreboard would have said 93.58if it wasn\u2019t for that absurd rule that makes it stop at 90. In the corner, Getafe\u2019s players leapt on each other, screaming. Jaime Mata slapped \u00c1ngel repeatedly on the head. On the touchline, the coaching staff embraced. Gracia watched, bewildered. His players wore lost looks. Sunk again, it had been so basic, another self-inflicted wound at a club whose skin is scored with scars. It was almost 11pm, curfew time now, the streets outside as deserted as the stands. There was nothing left to try, just one last desperate punt. Amazingly, it worked. On 95.16, 44 seconds left, Maxi took the kick-off, played it back to Gabriel and set off running, heading to the place he\u2019d headed all game: his opponents. Gabriel gave it to Daniel Wass, who paused to let his teammates pile forward and then sent a long, high hoof up the pitch, dropping inside Getafe\u2019s area. Pulled by Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez, bundled by Djen\u00e9 Dakonam, Maxi went down and the referee pointed to the spot. The time was 95.26: it had taken 10 seconds and three touches. As the maddening crowd gathered, Su\u00e1rez was sent off \u2013 although it took him a couple of minutes to go \u2013 Mata got a yellow card and Cucho was called to the bench. He ran over, ran on again, and whispered something to Soria, the secret to stopping this penalty. Time passed. \u201cLogically, they were doing their job; trying to get it looked to, trying to put it back,\u201d Gracia said. Soler picked up the ball up on 96.36, backed away from the noise and waited while it happened \u2013 Cucho\u2019s run, Su\u00e1rez\u2019s red, all the recriminations. On 99.12, he wiped the ball on his shirt and finally put it down, took a couple of steps back and waited again. Then he side-footed it into the corner. 99.32, 2-2. Maxi bundled into the net trying to get the ball back and seek a third, but there was no time for more. \u201cThe game was gone and the equaliser didn\u2019t do justice \u2013 we deserved to win\u2013 but at least it wasn\u2019t so cruel,\u201d Gracia said. The point doesn\u2019t help much \u2013 Valencia are 13th, three points above the relegation zone \u2013 but, captain Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e0 insisted: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t care about that: seriously, I don\u2019t. What I care about is how we played.\u201d Forty metres or so to his left, a single wooden chair sat pitchside with two roses laid on it in honour of Espa\u00f1eta, the kitman who dedicated his life to the club and died recently. The dressing room has been named after him. Outside, flowers had been laid, pictures and messages of thanks, many citing his famous line I live and die for Valencia. \u201cWe deserved to win, let alone draw,\u201d Gay\u00e0 continued. \u201cThis is the Valencia we want. I\u2019m proud of my players tonight. This is the path to follow, the one Espa\u00f1eta showed us. We need to continue like this.\u201d They needed a result like this. At the same time as Valencia were playing Getafe, central midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia was in Madrid joining Atl\u00e9tico, who had been given special permission to sign after losing Thomas Partey on the final day when Arsenal paid his buyout clause. Even with the window closed Valencia weren\u2019t safe, the haemorrhaging continuing, another asset stripped. In the summer, Valencia sold Dani Parejo and Francis Coquelin to Villarreal for \u20ac8m. They sold Ferr\u00e1n Torres and Rodrigo Moreno and released Ezequiel Garay. All of them were starters. Jaume Costa and Cristiano Piccini went too. They signed no one, despite Gracia lining up deals personally. Now, having accused the club of destroying everything and lying to him, Kongdobia has gone as well \u2013 two weeks after president, Anil Murthy, had assured Gracia he wouldn\u2019t. Half the team that had won the 2019 cup has gone. So has the manager, the sporting director and the CEO. Last week, even the press officer went. The association of supporters\u2019 clubs has gone too, forced to vacate their locale at Mestalla after 25 years. Gracia offered to walk, it is only the pay-off that keeps him at a club that can\u2019t afford to sack him and would rather he resigned. \u201cYou know what I think,\u201d he said last night when he was pushed on the latest departure. \u201cAll I know about is what I read in the media. It\u2019s not up to me to explain; let those responsible for it do that. It does no good lamenting the players we haven\u2019t got. I have the players I have and I\u2019m proud of them. I\u2019m here for the team, to try to get them to play better and we\u2019re on the right path.\u201d Maybe they are now, Soler\u2019s penalty offering a way back and a way forward, not just because of the result but the way it happened and against which team. It may yet be a false dawn, and the reality is unavoidable, but is something. Gay\u00e0 said he hoped it would be a turning point. \u201cSomething to cling on to,\u201d Las Provincias called it. \u201cA black hole had been about to swallow them up but they\u2019re alive, despite everything,\u201d Super Deporte claimed. The alternative was bleak, as crushing as it would have been cruel. It wasn\u2019t just the game that was almost over when Soler put the ball down, it was much deeper than that, his calm amid the madness delivering a release, a little hope at last. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t got a point tonight, it would have hard to convince the players that we did many things well,\u201d Gracia admitted. \u201cIt was already unfair not to win; not to have even got a point would have been terribly unfair. At least we got that small reward which lets us look on things with different eyes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
