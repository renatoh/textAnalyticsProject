It's as if we've given up on the genuine article and are more comfortable with parody - even when what's at stake is our very survival as a species. It's the postmodern condition - and while generally a pretty up-to-the-minute sort of chap, I feel it would be wiser to retrench, to reconnect with an aspect of Kipling's era, when people - albeit repressed and often miserable - still displayed some sense of value, of what was decent. Or maybe I'm idealising the past. Nonetheless, I'm standing up for a return to human decency, a return to valuing content over style, to valuing the very miracle of our existence, instead of projecting all our aspirations for a meaningful life on to celebrities who between them have as much genuine talent and about as much to actually offer the world as a bunch of bananas. I'm not suggesting a political movement at all. I suggest a radical revision on an individual basis: each of us coming awake to what's going on - the level of crisis we face in every aspect of human society - and then taking full responsibility for creating a personal environment of integrity and honour, concepts now so old-fashioned even the words sound dated. But if each of us can start living again according to such standards, we will have a chance of teaching by example, and will possibly influence a trend. We have been witnessing a gross deterioration in intellectual standards across the board - a vast and insidious EastEnders- or Coronation Street-style dumbing down of reality. I feel it's our duty, those of us with brains not yet addled by alcohol, numbed by TV or sullied by overexposure to the tabloid press, to make this stand together - a last stand, perhaps, against the ravages of mediocrity. Are you with me?
