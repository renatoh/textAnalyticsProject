Frank Evans, Britain's leading bullfighter, was told by doctors in Valencia this week that a persistent injury means this season will be his last. \"I need a new knee,\" he told the Guardian yesterday. \"And you're not allowed to fight bulls with an artificial joint.\" The Spanish public were initially sceptical about a foreigner's involvement in the sport which they consider an art form. And while the son of a Manchester butcher was never a great artist in the ring, the fans learned to recognise a fundamental quality that is the same all over the world: Frank Evans has got balls. Evans saw his first corrida in Granada in 1964. He was hooked straight away. But Salford in the 60s offered few opportunities to a prospective matador. The following summer Evans set off for Majorca to track down his illustrious predecessor, Vincent Charles Hitchcock, the first English matador. Hitchcock set Evans off on a trail round Spain picking up tips, going to bullfighting schools and washing a lot of dishes. In 1966, at the age of 18, he landed his first fight in Barcelona. \"Looking back it was bloody ridiculous. It was the first time I'd faced an actual animal and I got thrown all over the place. But in the end I popped the sword in him so I just about got away with it.\" Evans wasn't actually supposed to get the fight. When the promoters asked for 'El Ingl\u00e9s' they were talking about another English prospect managed by Brian Epstein, the Beatles manager. They were surprised to discover that there was more than one Englishman on the scene. But by then the contracts were signed. Evans took a break from the bulls during most of the 70s while he returned to the UK, married and started a family. He returned in 1978 after the death of his father. \"He was only 59 when he died,\" he said. \"It seemed so quick and short, and I could feel my own life slipping away.\" Since then he has fought virtually every season. Now Evans hopes he will be able to manage one last fight before he bows out. \"If I strap the knee up and have a cortisone injection I might be able to get through,\" he said. \"It would be good to finish on my own terms rather than being forced out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
