A year at Brisbane Grammar costs about $25,000, 30% of the average full-time worker\u2019s pre-tax salary. A few thousand dollars less buys a year at St Paul\u2019s, the other elite Brisbane private school to come under the microscope in hearings this month by the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Grammar in particular retains a reputation as the state\u2019s top school, with an alumni that peppers the top ranks of the local establishment. This is no solace to the family of one victim of the school\u2019s first student counsellor, Kevin Lynch, whose abuse of the boy was so severe he suffered an organic brain injury. The school gave the former student an out-of-court compensation payout of $45,000, which would not cover two years at Grammar today. His mother told the commission: \u201cWe wanted only the best for our children. What did we get for our money? We got the worst anyone could possibly imagine.\u201d Still, Grammar\u2019s links to leading legal figures were on show during commission hearings in Brisbane, as were the complications this posed for former students seeking redress. One victim spoke of approaching a veteran criminal solicitor to pursue his case, only to find his phone calls unanswered and that the lawyer had been the chairman of Grammar\u2019s board of governors at the time the abuse occurred. The solicitor did not give evidence at the commission. Another victim noted the lower school headmaster who first sent him for counselling sessions with his abuser was now a judge. The judge did not give evidence. \u201cI just wonder where his judgment was back then,\u201d he told the commission. The second victim was furious to discover that the barrister whom he had paid a decade earlier for legal advice on his abuse claim was representing the school in the Brisbane hearings. The barrister excused himself from questioning the victim. The victim suggested in the hearing it was the legal expertise of Howard Stack, a former partner at one of Australia\u2019s most prestigious law firms, that prompted the school to appoint Stack to head its board in the wake of abuse revelations in 1991. It did not take a royal commission to reveal the abuse of as many as 100 boys by Lynch through most of the 1970s and 80s. Nor the abuse at St Paul\u2019s by the same man through the 1990s \u2013 an echo of earlier crimes by a music teacher, Gregory Robert Knight, whom the Anglican school allowed to quietly resign, enabling a continued run of impunity across three states. The unlikely trigger for revelations of Lynch\u2019s serial abuse came 15 years earlier with the death of one of the counsellor\u2019s victims, Nigel Parodi, who shot three police then himself in Brisbane in 2000. A flood of compensation claims followed. But the commission hearings gave the first public platform for many victims to detail the horror of what unfolded in Lynch\u2019s locked, soundproof office \u2013 the one students could only enter when they saw a light turn green. The most disturbing accounts described sadistic sexual abuse by Lynch \u2013 face slappings, insertion of acupuncture needles into a student\u2019s penis, underpants bloodied by anal penetration, coercion into sexual acts under hypnosis and the guise of \u201ctherapy\u201d to \u201charness the power\u201d of a teen\u2019s orgasms to boost academic and sporting performance. Victims who often lived at the margins of a stoic school culture in which rugby and rowing were king described how Lynch insinuated himself as a father figure in their lives. His counselling sessions were undocumented and subject to no external assessment by the school. The commission heard witness accounts of complaints about abuse by Lynch going directly to various Grammar staff, including the then headmaster Maxwell Howell. Howell, like Lynch, is now dead but repeatedly denied any knowledge of alleged abuse before his death. A series of senior Grammar figures who took the stand at the commission either denied outright or said they could not recall being told of Lynch\u2019s abuse or inappropriate relationships with students. At Grammar, as at St Paul\u2019s, there was no formal reporting system for complaints of sexual abuse. The school\u2019s barrister repeatedly disputed witness accounts that they told Howell about the abuse. But the apparent credibility and consistency in detail of some accounts only fuelled suspicions among Lynch victims of a cover-up, a feat of wilful blindness, to preserve the school\u2019s formidable reputation \u2013 the very thing, in the words of one victim, it \u201ctraded on\u201d. Through it all, Grammar\u2019s response remained a model of modern corporate crisis management. Its core position is not a moral but a legal one: it denies liability. It did not deny the fact of Lynch\u2019s abuse. But it maintains it was not responsible because the hierarchy did not know. Stack, who remains the head of the Grammar school board, broke down in the witness box when describing the moral dilemma of negotiating settlements with some 65 Lynch victims in 2002. Stack said he personally believed victims and admitted that the credibility of Howell\u2019s denials was now \u201cnot looking good\u201d. But the school board had \u201cno option\u201d but to deny legal responsibility, he said. \u201cI was between a rock and a hard place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the school was going to get indemnity, we could not admit legal liability. When all this happened, I came out so fast and admitted moral responsibility. I could do no more.\u201d The school\u2019s insurer had threatened to leave the school to pay all claims itself because of evidence Howell knew of abuse claims. In the end it insisted the school shoulder some of the costs for that reason. It was a former Grammar colleague, Gilbert Case, who hired Lynch after he left Grammar to work at St Paul\u2019s, where he abused children using the same modus operandi, including the lighting entry system to his office. Case denied any knowledge that his former friend was a \u201cwholesale paedophile\u201d but with a striking caveat \u2013 that at the time he was headmaster at St Paul\u2019s he would not have considered a teacher fondling a boy\u2019s genitals a crime. Like the Grammar headmasters, Case rejected accounts from students and parents that they complained to him of abuse by Lynch. Case said he initially considered the complaint that led to Lynch being charged with sexual assault of a former St Paul\u2019s student as \u201cvexatious and vindictive\u201d. The Anglican church put some symbolic daylight between itself and Grammar in one respect of its response to the commission hearings. Archbishop Phillip Aspinall has signalled the church will refund considerable fees paid to St Paul\u2019s by victims of abuse by Lynch and Knight. But Aspinall indicated to the commission that the church, even when it was willing to take a less combative tack with victims in legal proceedings, had scarcely any more opportunity to do so while \u201ctrapped\u201d by the terms of their insurance contracts. This led to the \u201cbizarre\u201d scenario where he was lobbying state governments to abandon the statute of limitations on legal claims \u2013 which ruled out most abuse victims who were usually in middle age by the time they were ready for their day in court \u2013 at the same time that the church\u2019s insurer was using the time-limit defence against former St Paul\u2019s students. Grammar victims were told by lawyers the same time-limit defence would probably allow the school to defeat their claims in court. Aspinall said there was an inherent conflict when insurers with commercial interests acted for a school or a church that wished to \u201cexpress care and concern for the survivor without voiding its insurance cover\u201d. Worse still, he saw no way \u201cthat conflict can be resolved\u201d. This means that churches and schools, regardless of any willingness to own up to their failures, remain captive to commercial imperatives that turn the handling of historical sexual abuse complaints into a Kafka-esque, if not grotesque, spectacle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
