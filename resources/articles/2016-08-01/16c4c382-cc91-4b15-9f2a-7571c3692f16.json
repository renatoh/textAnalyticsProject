Lead single It\u2019s Different for Girls is impeccably catchy electro-pop, betrayed by lyrics shallower than a Facebook meme. It might be easier to respect its trite musings on gender \u2013 girls are \u201cmercurial creatures\u201d, apparently \u2013 if the artwork didn\u2019t include a line drawing of four pairs of perky breasts. When Barnes applies his huge gift for melody to less predictable pastiches than usual there are gorgeous moments, like the swirling coda to My Fair Lady, or the motorik sulk of Chap Pilot. But mostly it feels like he\u2019s lost in the dress-up box, never quite finding a mask to fit his ever-changing face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
