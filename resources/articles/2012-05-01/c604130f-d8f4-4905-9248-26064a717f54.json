The Ibrox club, who are in administration, were hit with the punishment last month for bringing the game into disrepute during Craig Whyte's time as chairman and owner. Rangers contested the ban on signing players and a \u00a3160,000 fine, with their administrators adamant the club should not be penalised for the actions of Whyte. But a three-man SFA appeals panel, which convened for more than four hours on Wednesday evening, insisted the punishment should stand. In a statement, the SFA said: \"The Appellate Tribunal will give its full reasons in writing in early course. However, in summary, it considers that: 1. It was competent for Disciplinary Tribunal to impose the additional sanction of prohibiting registrations of any new players of 18 years or older for a period of 12 months. 2. The Disciplinary Tribunal was correct to determine that the conduct involved \u2013 especially the deliberate non-payment of very large sums, estimated in excess of \u00a313m of tax in the form of PAYE, NIC and VAT \u2013 was attributable to the club as a member of the Scottish FA. 3. The Disciplinary Tribunal was correct also in holding that the maximum fine available for this breach was \u00a3100,000, and on its own was inadequate as a punishment for this misconduct. It was therefore correct to select an additional sanction.\" It now remains to be seen what impact the sanction will have on Charles Green's takeover plans. The ex-Sheffield United chief executive hopes to conclude a deal to buy Rangers imminently. In what represents a further headache for the Rangers manager, Ally McCoist, several of his key first-team players can leave Ibrox for knockdown fees this summer due to clauses in their contracts. The SFA added: \"Although the Appellate Tribunal has listened carefully to the representations from Rangers FC about the practical effects of the additional sanction, it has concluded that this sanction was proportionate to the breach, dissuasive to others and effective in the context of serious misconduct, bringing the game into disrepute. In particular, the Appellate Tribunal recognises that the Disciplinary Tribunal decision does not affect Rangers' ability to extend the contracts of existing professional players, including those whose contracts will expire at the end of this season and including also those currently on loan to other clubs. The Appellate Tribunal observes that Rangers FC have over 40 professional players in this category.\" Green was frustrated by the developments but backed any future appeal. \"Our group went into the purchase of the club with this sanction in place but we hoped the decision would at least be commuted,\" he said. \"We fully support the club as it considers an appeal against this latest decision.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
