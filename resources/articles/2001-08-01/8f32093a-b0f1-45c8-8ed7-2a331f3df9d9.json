From Monday, the supermarket's customers will be allowed to redeem their points to part-pay for weddings in Australia and the Caribbean as part of a deal between Tesco and holiday company Tradewinds. However, if your dream holiday wedding is as much, or more, as the average wedding cost of \u00a314,000 you could be waiting for some time. Tesco give one point, equal to one penny, for every pound you spend. These points are added up on a monthly basis and sent to customers in the form of vouchers. The wedding packages are included in the Deals brochure. And, as an incentive, Tesco will double the value of the Clubcard vouchers when used on products included in the promotion. It will also quadruple the value of points for those who spend an average of \u00a360 a week over a three-month period. The scheme can also be used for ordinary worldwide breaks to destinations such as America and Asia, which are offered by Premier holidays. \"The cost of a wedding and all the trimmings often means that couples have to pull in the purse strings for that dream exotic honeymoon [and opt] for somewhere closer to home,\" says Tesco director John Gildersleeve. \"However, our new scheme makes dreams a reality by enabling shoppers to save up their Clubcard vouchers for up to two years, and then trade them in for fantastic breaks they otherwise would not be able to afford.\" If the scheme proves to be a success Tesco intends to branch out into the weddings market - selling bridalwear, hair accessories, shoes and garters in its stores. The supermarket is anticipating the holiday scheme will generate \u00a310m in holidays inside its first year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
