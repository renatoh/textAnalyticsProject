Having watched, cursed and ultimately despaired of their team's shortcomings on Saturday, Middlesbrough fans arrived home to discover they had actually put another point between themselves and the relegation zone. But they may have aged a few years in the process. The run of draws that had extended Terry Venables' 12-game unbeaten start and prompted deceptive security has been transformed into a winless seven-match streak. With Charlton, their safety assured, playing with slick aplomb, home nerves began jangling within two minutes. Radostin Kishishev advanced down the right flank and crossed for Jonatan Johansson, completely unmarked, to nod wide. Five minutes later Claus Jensen obligingly passed the Finnish striker's cross into Mark Schwarzer's midriff, and by the time Shaun Bartlett ballooned over the bar early in the second half many of the home faithful had been reduced to gibbering wrecks. \"It only takes one bad ball or a missed tackle to start the crowd off,\" said Schwarzer, who missed the death throes of Boro's relegation in 1997 - a demotion which still haunts Teesside - with a broken leg. \"It doesn't help when the fans go off at us, but they get frustrated and it's understandable. \"But we are in a far better position now than we were four years ago. We were conceding goals all over the place in '97 and I think we are a better side now, even if we had better individuals back then.\" What Boro wouldn't give for the creative fizz of a Juninho, Paul Merson or Nick Barmby to spark their shot-shy front line into life. Only when Christian Karembeu marauded forward after 71 minutes did the home side suggest self-confidence, but even the Frenchman prompted boos seven minutes later when he squared Alen Boksic's cross to a Charlton defender rather than shoot at goal. Otherwise Boksic - who forced Sasa Ilic into a late save and retained his air of untapped class - and the demoralised Hamilton Ricard cut isolated figures. At least Dean Windass, who should complete a \u00a3600,000 move from Bradford today, will provide a more rugged link between midfield and attack, allowing the Croatian to concentrate on tormenting defenders rather than withdrawing into midfield in search of the ball. The Colombian, racked with self-doubt, may be beyond salvation. \"We should have won the game after the start we had,\" said the Charlton and England defender Chris Powell, who ended a fairytale week with an immaculate defensive display. \"Boro haven't lost, but three points are paramount at the moment. It's getting a bit tight now. But they are creating chances and I think they will stay up. Just.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
