The election campaign has started. The speech, delivered in the symbolic constituency of Enfield, north London, spectacularly wrenched from the Thatcherite Michael Portillo in 1997, begins the process of setting out the basis on which Labour will seek its second term mandate, and through Mr Blair's emphasis on 10-year plans - by implication - a third term. It made hardly any reference to the Conservatives. Over the next few weeks, Mr Blair will in stages unveil the Labour manifesto, including his over-arching theme of an open society, breaking down barriers to true equal opportunity. The inoffensive word \"opportunity\" has been frequently appropriated by politicians and represented the core slogan of John Major's successful election campaign in 1992. Yesterday Mr Blair claimed: \"Opening up economy and society to merit and talent is the true radical second term agenda. In the past the idea of meritocracy has been attacked. But creating a society that is meritocratic is not wrong; it is just insufficient. It needs to recognise talent in all its forms, not just intelligence. \"It cannot be achieved by the government standing back and allowing a Darwinian survival of the fittest, and pretending that it is meritocracy. It requires an open government ensuring a fair playing field.\" Planning for this run-in to the manifesto started over a year ago when David Miliband, head of the No 10 policy unit and Ed Richards, the chief second term planner, started the policy preparations. Initially they worked on the vision of what an upwardly mobile, modern Britain might resemble, and then started on the detailed policy, putting ideas to Whitehall departments. Some will argue the goals outlined yesterday actually represent a more Brownite agenda, but the means remain distinctly Blairite. There are proposals to appeal to traditional Labour voters, such as big public services investment, but set alongside Blairite notions of public-private partnerships. After four years of pressure on public sector workers, the prime minister also now offers a warmer tone. He commits himself to devolving power in the public services, describing teachers, doctors, nurses police officers as \"the social entrepreneurs of the future\". Yet the pressure to spread competition and modernise the public services remains. He promises a new drive to try and win the 30-year Labour crusade for equal pay for women. But he also trails radical new welfare ideas, such as offering \"baby bonds,\" so young people accumulate assets with the potential to give them a financial base in the future. Blairites believes the bonds are redistributive, encourage saving and provide security in an insecure labour market. However, yesterday's speech was also remarkable in that it signalled a new determination to push ahead with reform of the comprehensive school system. Selection will not be reintroduced, but comprehensive uniformity is out. The new buzz word is making sure each school has its own unique ethos, so there will be more specialist schools, more voluntary schools within the state system, and greater diversity in teachers' hours and pay. The prime minister's spoikesman, Alastair Campbell, said yesterday that Mr Blair saw the new business specialist schools as a crucial example of bringing together the public and private sectors - such schools will be expected to develop strong links with local businesses. Mr Blair also candidly admits that the first phase of New Labour only laid the foundations for reform and was heavily driven by the need to reassure voters. The prime minister said: \"We weren't going to repeat the same mistakes of the past - trades unions would be treated fairly, but without favours, there would be no old style tax and spend, business would be welcomed as a partner\". Mr Blair claims his first administration has laid the ghosts of its own past. Now he can be afford to be a bit more radical. The party need no longer define itself by proving it is not the old Labour party. The next few weeks, he appears to be saying, as the second term programme unfolds will finally reveal the Blairite government in its true colours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
