(All fun and games until you accidentally put your finger over the camera seven times in a minute.) I had been trying to wean myself off Twitter before the crisis, but Alistair Green\u2019s skits keep pulling me back to it. He\u2019s a comedian who is insanely good at social media, and who specialises in Limmy-ish, David Brent-esque visions of terrible middle-Englanders. His coronavirus content has been particularly impressive, offering light relief by sending up prejudice and delving into farce. Highlights include a woman whose husband won\u2019t eat Chinese food any more, though carbonara is fine; a mock press conference where the PM zones out to think about hot buttery toast; and parental video call fails, all filmed solo and fuss-free in Green\u2019s living room. After briefly trying to get into TikTok \u2013 which I have decided is mostly just videos of footballers I\u2019ve not heard of doing viral dance challenges \u2013 I\u2019m back with everyone else over the age of 14 on YouTube. In particular, the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen has reeled me in. The US food magazine\u2019s content seems to have become A Thing in the past year, but I\u2019d never really got it. I love cooking, I read cookbooks when I\u2019m bored, and Nigel Slater\u2019s programmes are among the only shows I can rewatch endlessly, but did I need to get into a cultish online cookery channel, too? The answer was yes, especially when you\u2019ve got strands such as It\u2019s Alive, in which lovely, laid-back Brad ferments things \u2013 perfect for our own new normal, where making your own mustard is a great way to kill a few hours \u2013 or Reverse Engineering, in which perfectly uptight Chris tweaks and retweaks recipes in order to replicate a mystery dish. Then there\u2019s upscale junk-food queen Claire\u2019s Gourmet Makes, featuring something called pizza rolls that got slightly lost in translation. Bon App\u00e9tit isn\u2019t the stuff of vomit-inducing viral videos, though, where someone puts cheddar cheese and cookie dough into a pie or something. Rather, it\u2019s a place that treats food as both artful and functional, making it ideal vicarious viewing when cooking feels like an anchor to long days and even longer weekends. And then there\u2019s telly. I\u2019ve been getting through it more quickly than I ever have in my six months of working on the Guardian TV desk, but, admittedly, there\u2019s a fair amount of half-watching and double-screening going on. I\u2019ve been in the mood for an improbable thriller to get lost in, and The Nest (BBC One), about a wealthy couple using a deprived teenager, has delivered. Incredible loch-side setting? Check. Completely wild plot? Check. Line of Duty\u2019s Martin Compston using his real Scottish accent? Check. Potential for one, if not all, of its leads to end up a cold-blooded killer? Check. I\u2019ve been eagerly collating my completely unproven theories, and watching along with the linear broadcasts rather than skipping ahead so that I can drag its five episodes out as much as possible. Whether it\u2019s Twitter comedy, food porn or an improbable drama, there\u2019s really no need to binge it all in one go now, is there? Unless it\u2019s Tiger King \u2013 definitely, definitely binge that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
