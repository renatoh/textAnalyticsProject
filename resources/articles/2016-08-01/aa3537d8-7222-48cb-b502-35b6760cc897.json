The Leicester manager explained that his objective every season is to win one point more than the previous campaign and he said nothing has changed since Leicester became Premier League champions. Ranieri revealed his target after it was pointed out to him that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger recently said he felt guilty that Arsenal missed out on winning the league last season. \u201cI\u2019m thinking only about my club,\u201d Ranieri said before Saturday\u2019s home game against Arsenal. \u201cI know we made 81 points [last season]. My ambition this season is to make 82 if possible. I don\u2019t think about the others.\u201d Ranieri made it clear that trying to reach 82 points had nothing to do with hoping to defend the title. \u201cNo, I want this for my philosophy for life,\u201d he said. \u201cI made 81, I start to try and improve on last season. That is my ambition every time.\u201d It promises to be a tall order, with an opening-day defeat at Hull City the worst possible start. Ranieri fully expects this season to be much harder for Leicester and painted a picture of a club who are playing catch-up with the teams that have traditionally competed for the positions at the top end of the table. \u201cWe are champions, but we are underdogs with a lot of big teams, because now we are building a team. City \u2013 how long? United \u2013 how long? Since [Sir Alex] Ferguson was manager \u2013 rebuild, rebuild. Tottenham, Liverpool \u2013 everybody. Slowly, slowly, we want to make very good building. So we are the underdog, it\u2019s normal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
