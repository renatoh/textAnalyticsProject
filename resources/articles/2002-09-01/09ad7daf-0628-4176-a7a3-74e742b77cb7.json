The 25-yard daisycutter which the Southampton goalkeeper Paul Jones inexplicably failed to save secured Albion's third successive victory - three wins on the bounce from a club many were saying would not have a points tally in double figures by Christmas. Gregan's goals are pretty much collectors' items. His last one came on Boxing Day last year for Preston at Wolves and this one was hardly a screamer into the top corner, Jones somehow allowing the ball to bounce over him. Gregan was shocked that the Welsh international failed to make a routine save. \"I only realised I had scored by the reaction of the crowd,\" said the 28-year-old, who arrived from Deepdale in the summer for \u00a31.5m after a lengthy pursuit by the Albion manager Gary Megson. \"There were too many bodies in the way after I had hit the ball but it was a great feeling knowing it had gone in.\" Gregan's performance probably merited a goal, even if it was far from a classic. He started the game as one of three central defenders before being moved into midfield where his poise and patience gave Albion more impetus. With endeavour outweighing quality on both sides, his display was illuminating. Megson admitted: \"We didn't play with any verve or zest in the first half although we stepped it up a bit after the break. The one good thing was that we won and it was fitting that Sean scored because I thought he was our best player.\" A touch of Megson psychol ogy also played a part in Albion's win. \"Our players are absolutely shattered,\" he said. \"But I told them if they won this game they could have Sunday and Tuesday off, if they drew they could have Sunday off, but if they lost they would be in all of the time.\" Megson's method paid off but his opposite number, Gordon Strachan, found it a bewildering afternoon. Southampton did not deserve to lose but they did not deserve to win. Though they lacked class they did squander the best two chances through Marian Pahars and had Paul Williams sent off for two yellow cards. Strachan said: \"It was not bad luck but lack of ability. If you can't get the ball in the net or make the final pass, or the ability is not good enough, then it is a problem. It was hard to take, though, because West Brom did not create a single chance. You can't even count the goal as a chance.\" Man of the match: Sean Gregan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
