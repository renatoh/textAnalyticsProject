Both men, the captains of England and Wales respectively before injury cut short their Six Nations campaigns, made it clear that they had not flown in merely to make up the numbers. Robinson, scorer of one of the great Lions tries in Brisbane four years ago, stayed at home to support his pregnant wife but now is ready to resume doing what he does best. \"This is the tour everyone wants to be on ... playing in New Zealand is going to be very tough and 45 players into 15 shirts doesn't go,\" he said yesterday. \"I've got to do my bit and impress in the upcoming games and hopefully, by the end of it, my name will be in the Test team. \"My wife's not been the best. She's pregnant at the moment and she's looking after three children, which is a very hard task in itself. But she's fine now and I'm looking forward to getting stuck into the games. Hopefully both myself and Gareth will make an impact. It's going to be hard because there are some great players. There is plenty of competition but hopefully it'll bring out the best in us.\" Thomas would not have been here until next week had his club, Toulouse, not been beaten in the French championship semi-finals, but now, like Robinson, he is poised to start a fresh Lions chapter against Wellington, when the 45th member of the party - the currently suspended Neil Back - will also be available for the first time. The Lions will temporarily be without the No8 Michael Owen, who is returning home on Sunday to attend the birth of his second child, but Thomas, like everyone else, is already wondering what Sir Clive Woodward will decide to do at fly-half, where Stephen Jones has finally arrived to put pressure on Jonny Wilkinson and Charlie Hodgson, the man of the match in the 36-14 win over Taranaki on Wednesday. \"It seems to be the million dollar question at the moment: who's going to be the man at No10?\" acknowledged Thomas. \"They've all got great qualities, but Stephen will bring massive enthusiasm and great control of the game. I'm not saying the other guys haven't got that but it's one of his strengths.\" The introduction of Thomas and Robinson, likewise, has complicated the back-three equation. Both Josh Lewsey and Geordan Murphy have started the tour well at full-back and the new arrivals may have more joy trying to force their way into the Test team on the wings, where competition is slightly less intense. So far Shane Williams, Denis Hickie, Mark Cueto and Shane Horgan have all had their moments but the selection of Tom Shanklin on the right wing against the Maori suggests that Woodward is looking to include at least one bigger, more physical wing in his Test XV. \u00b7 Ma'a Nonu, the All Black centre, has been given the all-clear after shoulder problems and is set to play for Wellington against the Lions next Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
