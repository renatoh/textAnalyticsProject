Spacelabs, based in Washington state, will be valued at more than $200m (\u00a3110m) when it floats within the next two months, and is expected to be the first of a number of such medical companies looking to raise money in London. The company manufactures the equipment that monitors patients in intensive care. It also makes machines that monitor premature babies in their cots, and sells the machines that deliver anaesthetic and check blood pressure. Spacelabs designed the first systems to monitor astronauts in space in 1958. It also sold the first intensive care unit monitors. The company has had a succession of different owners in recent years. Last year GE sold the company to X-ray machine maker OSI Systems for $57m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
