Repeated demands by the Prince of Wales to senior Saudi officials ultimately proved crucial in releasing the men, two of whom faced the death penalty after being accused of conducting a wave of bombings in the kingdom. St James's Palace confirmed last night that the prince had used his contacts at the highest level of the Saudi government to cam paign for clemency on behalf of the men. Prince Charles has been criticised for his continued friendship with high-profile Saudis but his intervention was welcomed last night by the men's families. 'I know he cannot get involved politically, but the Saudis love our royal family and his involvement will have helped tremendously,' said Mary Martini, the former wife of one of the freed men, James Cottle. The move came as extraordinary claims emerged last night of a pact offered by the Saudi authorities in return for their release. According to relatives, the Saudis asked the men to sign a document as part of the deal, implicating themselves in the bombings, which they refused to do. It is also understood that Saudi officials attempted to force the Britons to sign a waiver prohibiting them from attempting to sue the Saudi authorities over their ordeal. The men spent the first day with their families yesterday after their release. Sandy Mitchell, from Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow, and William Sampson, a Glasgow-based Canadian, had faced public beheading after being found guilty of planting a car bomb that killed British engineer Christopher Rodway in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in November 2000. Cottle, Les Walker, Peter Brandon, James Lee and Glenn Ballard were arrested between late 2000 and mid-2001 as co-conspirators. Although UK intelligence agencies have always believed the bombs were planted by Islamic extremists, the Saudi authorities claimed they were part of a Western alcohol turf war. Prince Charles is thought to have used his connections with Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain, Prince Turki al-Faisal, a controversial figure who ran Saudi's Arabia's intelligence for almost a quarter of a century. Turki has been named in a lawsuit brought by the families of victims of the terrorist attacks on 11 September, who claim he was a supporter of al-Qaeda. He denies the allegations. He made the release of the Britons a priority when he was appointed to the post of ambassador late last year. Charles is known to have met Turki at a function to open a clinic in Oxford last year. Although Charles's intervention has been welcomed by the men's families, it is likely to raise questions over his involvement in sensitive diplomatic issues. He has a long-standing relationship with the Saudi royal family and has been a popular figure in the desert kingdom since a lecture he gave in 1993 suggesting that the materialistic West could learn from the more spiritual Islamic world. He is a close friend of Prince Khalid al-Faisal, with whom he shares an interest in painting. Charles held regular functions with Turki al-Faisal's predecessor, Dr Ghazi Algosaibi, who was recalled after printing a poem in praise of suicide bombers. News of Prince Charles's intervention came amid fresh attacks on the Foreign Office's handling of the case. Families believe the Government's strategy was dictated more by a desire not to upset the Saudis than securing the men's freedom. John Pugh, the Liberal Democrat MP for Southport, whose constituent David Brown lost his sight and a hand in one of the Riyadh explosions, said yesterday the media had been crucial in keeping the men's situation in the public eye. Further details emerged about the delicate diplomatic process that led to the men's unexpected release last week. Attempts to persuade the Saudi authorities to release the Britons began to bear fruit in January during a visit from then international Trade Minister Baroness Symons. This was followed by a meeting between Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Crown Prince Abdullah. However, security sources in Saudi last night said the key agreement was made at the G8 summit in Evian last June when Crown Prince Abdullah reached an understanding with Tony Blair that the British prisoners would be released by the summer. The sources confirmed that Prince Turki was the main negotiator, along with deputy interior minister Mohammed Bin Naif, who worked out the details with MI6. The Foreign Office last night confirmed for the first time that the men's release was discussed regularly on ministerial visits to the kingdom, and just prior to Parliament's summer recess, MPs campaigning for the men's freedom met Turki at the Saudi embassy in London.
