The timing of Wednesday morning\u2019s announcement \u2013 in which Hall is expected to award a big job to head of strategy James Purnell, as well confirm senior roles for head of television Charlotte Moore and director of news James Harding \u2013 is likely to raise eyebrows as it will be made on the same day as the long-awaited Chilcot report. BBC insiders described the reorganisation as \u201csensible and practical\u201d given the need for cost savings after last year\u2019s financial settlement with the government. Wednesday\u2019s announcement is expected to focus on new reporting lines with a stronger emphasis on education. Purnell, who led the corporation\u2019s charter renewal talks in which the BBC was felt to have headed off the government\u2019s more radical proposals, is expected to be given greater responsibility for education as part of the overhaul. Helen Boaden is expected to remain head of radio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
