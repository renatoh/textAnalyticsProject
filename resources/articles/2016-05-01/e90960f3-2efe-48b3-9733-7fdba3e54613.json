The 20-year-old is one of Europe\u2019s most sought-after talents and has been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain following an impressive first season at United. On Saturday at Wembley against Crystal Palace Martial hopes to fire the club to a 12th FA Cup triumph and a first since 2004, by adding to his 17 goals in 48 appearances. It was Martial\u2019s superb strike in the dying moments against Everton in the semi-final that sent United into their first Cup final since losing to Chelsea in 2007. The celebration featured the Frenchman jumping into the delirious supporters behind the goal. Now, asked if he can see himself at United for a long time, despite the interest of PSG, Martial says: \u201cYou never know what happens in the future but certainly the fans have accepted me really well and the fact they sing this song about me all the time shows they\u2019re quite happy with me. I just do my best to try to pay back that support. \u201cI love Manchester and I love being here and certainly I see myself being here for a good while yet. I\u2019m certainly happy here. \u201cThe way the fans have accepted me \u2013 I have got a special relationship with them and I\u2019m grateful because they\u2019ve always been there for me. From the moment I arrived they\u2019ve done their best to make me feel relaxed and part of things. It has gone some way to helping me in my overall settling-in period. \u201cThe semi-final goal was very important. It was the one that got us through and killed off the match because it was so near to the end. It was great to go into the crowd and celebrate with the fans and great to get through to the final.\u201d The chant Martial mentions makes fun of some of the media coverage of last summer\u2019s move from Monaco for \u00a336m, a fee that could rise to \u00a358m. At that moment he was a relative unknown and the ditty goes: \u201cTony Martial came from France/English press said he had no chance/50 million down the drain/As Tony Martial scores again\u201d. Does he ever join in? The question brings a first smile. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the words, well at least all of them anyway,\u201d he says. After the forward signed for United Wayne Rooney had to ask Morgan Schneiderlin, another French player, who the new purchase was. There is a shrug. \u201cWell, he knows me now doesn\u2019t he,\u201d Martial says, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that story as well. I guess it\u2019s pretty amusing.\u201d The fans\u2019 adoration was ignited inside the first half-hour of his United career. Liverpool were the opposition at Old Trafford on 12 September when Louis van Gaal took off Juan Mata and brought on Martial after 65 minutes. With United leading 2-1 and Liverpool pressing for an equaliser after Christian Benteke\u2019s goal a few moments earlier, Martial glided along the left, mugged a hapless Martin Srktel twice and beat Simon Mignolet with a cold-eyed 86th-minute finish at the Stretford End that sent the home crowd ballistic. This is his outstanding moment of the season \u2013 so far. \u201cIt just couldn\u2019t have been a better way to start,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom being a young kid I\u2019d dreamed of playing at Old Trafford and to be able to score in my first game in such a way against such an important opponent, United\u2019s biggest rival, it couldn\u2019t have turned out any better. \u201cIt was positive, gave me lots of confidence, it helped me to settle in as a player. Fortunately, things started to go well for me from that moment on and I kept scoring regularly. \u201cThat does create more expectation among the fans but I still consider I\u2019m a player who has a lot to learn and I\u2019m going to carry on learning and progressing as an individual.\u201d Paul Scholes\u2019s criticism of United\u2019s travails under Van Gaal is usually welcomed by fans, but when the former midfielder claimed in November that Martial was not a centre-forward who \u201clives for goals\u201d Scholes felt a backlash. Again, in the calm manner that allows such a young man to play with freedom, Martial is unruffled. \u201cI\u2019d heard about that,\u201d he says. \u201cGoalscoring is what I do and it\u2019s the thing that makes me most happy. But I\u2019m not the sort of guy who shows that sort of emotion on the outside too much. But not happy when I score? Scoring makes me happiest because it\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d As the song about him and the story involving Rooney illustrates, there was a view Martial\u2019s large transfer fee would prove a staggering waste of money. Now, the opposite appears true. Even if the sum reaches \u00a358m he will be bargain should this season\u2019s form be repeated over the coming years. Martial acknowledges the pressure of the price tag and points to how his previous transfer, to Monaco in June 2013, prepared him. \u201cWhat helped me in that situation is I\u2019d already gone through quite an expensive transfer when I moved from Lyon and that created a lot of interest and people spoke about it a lot in France,\u201d he says. \u201cI just tried to remain true to who I am as a person, keep calm and do my best. My first season has gone OK but I\u2019m hoping to have a better season next time around. I didn\u2019t try to put too much pressure on myself. People mention the price tag but I just came here to do my best. Things have gone relatively well but I still feel deep down I could have done better than I have done.\u201d United have a long tradition of canonising players. These include Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo and of joining this group Martial says: \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly say at this early stage. It all depends on how I play, how many goals I score, how I perform in the years to come. If that was to be the case and I was to become an icon then I\u2019d be very happy.\u201d There is one match remaining of his first season and by the end a disappointing United campaign that ended with failure to qualify for the Champions League could at least end in FA Cup glory. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too aware of the history of the competition but I know every trophy you can win has huge importance and we\u2019re going to try to do everything we can to bring the cup back to Manchester,\u201d Martial says. \u201cIt was a fantastic atmosphere [at Wembley against Everton]. It was full for the semi but I guess it\u2019s going to be an even better atmosphere in the final and we\u2019re just going to do everything we can to make sure we win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
