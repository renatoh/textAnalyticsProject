They will talk at the G20 summit in Hamburg, which runs on Friday and Saturday. The two leaders will hold a formal bilateral meeting, at which the prime minister plans to tell the US president she does not believe the Paris climate change agreement needs to be renegotiated. Trump caused consternation worldwide last month when he confirmed that he wanted to withdraw from the pact. May was criticised at the time for not signing a letter sent by several European governments condemning the move \u2013 though she insisted she had discussed it with him directly. But a senior government official said the prime minister would be \u201cstressing that the UK remains fully committed to the Paris agreement. She will say that we don\u2019t see any need for renegotiation \u2013 we support the Paris agreement because it delivers.\u201d May and Trump are also expected to discuss this week\u2019s North Korean missile test, with the prime minister stressing that it is essential the international community is united in condemnation of North Korea\u2019s actions. Barry Gardiner, Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet minister dealing with climate change, called for a more robust approach on climate, saying the prime minister should \u201ctake President Trump to task\u201d for his announcement that the US will quit the international accord to address dangerous global warming. Gardiner said: \u201cA Labour prime minister would make clear that the UK stands by the Paris agreement and that America is diminished by the president\u2019s foolish and shortsighted decision to withdraw.\u201d May and Trump\u2019s last face-to-face meeting was at the G7 in Sicily, in an unscheduled \u201cpull aside\u201d in which Downing street said they \u201creaffirmed their commitment to increasing trade between the UK and the US, including a post-Brexit trade deal\u201d. The prime minister was later criticised for failing to sign up to a joined up statement from the G7\u2019s EU leaders \u2013 Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Italy\u2019s Paolo Gentiloni \u2013 saying the Paris accord could not be renegotiated. The trio said: \u201cWe deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.\u201d Downing Street stressed that the UK had responded in a normal way to the situation, and that the other G7 countries, Canada and Japan, had not signed up to the statement either. Since May\u2019s last meeting with Trump the US president caused anger in the UK by misquoting the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, following the London bridge terror attack last month. Trump castigated Khan on Twitter, saying the mayor had said there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d by the attack. Khan had in fact said this about the increased and armed police presence in London after the attack. Trump had been due to hold a state visit to the UK over the summer, which was set to be dogged by mass protests. However, this appears to have been indefinitely put back, with Trump reportedly telling May he did not want to make the trip if the British public did not support him. While Downing Street has insisted the plans have not changed, Trump\u2019s arrival was not mentioned in last month\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, as is normal for state visits, indicating has not been fixed for the two-year period covered by the address."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
