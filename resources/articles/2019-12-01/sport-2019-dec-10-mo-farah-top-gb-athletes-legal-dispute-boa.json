In an unprecedented statement the BOA said it was \u201cdismayed\u201d by \u201congoing legal tactics\u201d from a group of British athletes that includes Sir Mo Farah, Laura Muir and Adam Gemili. They are seeking to challenge the International Olympic Committee\u2019s Rule 40 which prevents individuals from using their image, name or performance in advertising around the games. The BOA said it had now responded \u201cfully and robustly\u201d to the legal action, which they claim to have learned about only through the media. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe BOA can confirm it has formally responded to the recent legal challenge brought against the BOA\u2019s interpretation of the IOC\u2019s Rule 40 in the UK. \u201cSince we learned of the legal challenge \u2013 through the media \u2013 we have proactively sought to understand the athletes\u2019 concerns and who, in fact, we are negotiating with \u2013 athletes, agents or commercial organisations. \u201cLast week we had a positive meeting with representatives of the athletes who have challenged Rule 40 and we continue to impress upon all concerned that we are open to dialogue and reaching a positive outcome that balances the desire for individual athletes to maximise their personal sponsorship revenues with the need to preserve and enhance a system that has collectively sold rights for the benefit of the whole of Team GB, including smaller sports and less high-profile athletes. \u201cHowever, despite those encouraging conversations, we have been dismayed by the ongoing legal tactics being conducted in the background, which in no way reflects the spirit of the discussions held. \u201cTherefore we have been forced to respond fully and robustly to the legal challenge and have done so in the best interests of all of the athletes we serve.\u201d Speaking last month, Gemili, who is a BOA athlete representative, claimed the legal action was a result of having their concerns ignored. \u201cThe situation as it stands is completely unfair,\u201d Gemili said. \u201cFor most athletes the Olympics is that one chance every four years to be in the limelight \u2013 and we want to be able to recognise those sponsors that have helped us make it to the Games. \u201cThe legal advice we have got is that we have a very strong case. Despite attempts to engage the BOA, we\u2019ve had no indication from them that things will get better. We continue to get brushed aside.\u201d Rule 40 has long proven controversial amongst athletes. This year, after a successful challenge in the German courts, the IOC ruled that individual countries would have the discretion to interpret the rule more leniently. The BOA responded with a slight shift, allowing athletes to share a generic message of thanks to their sponsors, \u201cprovided it doesn\u2019t contain any Olympic branding, such as a medal or Team GB kit or references\u201d. The Guardian has attempted to contact the athletes\u2019 representatives for comment following the BOA statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
